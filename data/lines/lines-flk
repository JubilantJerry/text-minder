Now, what do you want --
CNN, New York Times?
No, I'm good, thanks.
You can go now.
Mysoulmate.biz?
Look, no one is more depressed about this than I am, but this is how people meet these days.
I mean, Diane Lane is doing it.
How bad can it be?
That was a movie.
Yes, but it was a movie she agreed to do, so she must've found the character plausible.
It's no big deal.
I didn't know you were looking.
Thought you had a thing for Nina.
Why would I have a thing for a person who's got a live-in boyfriend of whom she's very forgiving?
She's not even available, so, no.
No.
No thing.
I mean, what choice do I have?
I tried acceptance.
I even tried being happy for her.
Now I have to try something for me.
Better this than think about what I can't have.
Does that make any sense?
Yeah, actually.
What is that?
Somebody is trying to I.M. you.
Who's Hottie Pilate?
Someone very bendy.
I'm not sure.
We never actually met.
We've just been, you know, sending e-mails back and forth.
This is the first semi-live experience.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
I don't spell well under pressure.
She wants to have dinner.
What if she's 93?
You'll have a good mah-jongg partner.
So, this is actually happening, isn't it?
Your social life is surpassing mine.
Ephram, I'm flirting with a computer.
What does "T-T-Y-L" mean?
"Talk To You Later."
Oh, and "K-O-S" means "Kid Over Shoulder,"
in case you don't want her to say anything inappropriate.
I have six surgeries this month.
I have to spend time learning how to talk in initials?
See, this is why I choose to be alone.
Was that really necessary?
We could've waited for it to set itself, but it's so much cooler to pop your bones back in on my own.
What are you doing now?
Just a quick checkup, if you don't mind.
You do realize this is your third accident in a month.
Is that weird?
Well, it's a little improbable for a 29-year-old rabbinical student with perfect vision, yes.
Are you ever dizzy or short of breath?
You think I'm out of shape or something?
My mom is always saying I've got her thighs.
Yes or no, Josh?
Sometimes.
- Sure.
- Yes.
You know, this isn't a test.
I just need you to be honest with me.
What's going on?
You think I've got something, don't you?
Oh, my god, it's a tumor the size of a grapefruit, right?
Mom always says it's a grapefruit.
Dad always says it's a melon.
The two of them make a deathly fruit salad.
Really?
Charming family you got there.
Look, I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.
All I want to do is run a C.A.T. scan, get a more comprehensive look inside.
Wouldn't that make you feel better?
I do appreciate your thoroughness.
So, uh, how are Delia's Bath Mitzvah lessons coming?
Aren't you seeing her tomorrow?
Am I?
Oh, yes, yeah.
She's doing okay.
Just okay?
I'm kind of new at this whole Bar/Bath Mitzvah thing.
I hadn't really taken into account how moody teenagers can be on their spiritual paths.
Teenagers are moody on their paths toward the refrigerator.
That's what they do.
But parents usually get involved in this stuff, which sometimes helps.
Maybe you should join us for a lesson.
Well, I'd love to be there.
But to be honest with you...
Delia and I haven't been getting along very well lately.
I doubt that she wants me around.
I don't want my parents around, either.
You think they give a flying fig what I want?
One of your duties as a parent is to protect and annoy.
So, can I count on you for tomorrow?
I think it'll really make a difference.
Well, if you think it would help, I'm there.
Oh, wait a minute -- tomorrow?
Oh, you know, tomorrow I can't.
I got a thing with a hottie -
- I mean, a pilate.
But I can postpone.
Well, I know it's not my department, Richard.
I don't run the White House, either.
It doesn't mean I don't vote.
Goodbye.
I'll just leave this right here.
Throw it on my desk.
I really need to vent.
Do you have five minutes?
Sure.
So, Dr. Kingsley resigned.
He was 76 and very with it, but more importantly he was the only one at the teaching hospital who could give instruction on the abortion procedure.
I can't believe that.
Doesn't anyone else know how?
Whatever students he had are spread across the country by now.
The blue parts, anyway.
Can't they just hire someone else?
No, it's not that they can't.
They're not gonna look very hard.
With no one left to teach it, fewer people are gonna know how to do one.
Soon it's not gonna matter whether abortion is legal or not.
Because nobody is gonna actually know how to perform one.
I know someone who knows how.
Really?
What kind of circles are you running in?
Well, no, it's my dad, actually.
He's a doctor, and I know for a fact that he can do the procedure.
I could talk to him about it.
That's amazing.
Do you actualy think he'd be interested in helping us out?
I don't know.
I mean, he's always talking about how he wants to get involved in my life.
I can ask him.
It can't hurt, right?
Absolutely.
What a relief.
Wouldn't it be great if we could make this happen?
You're my savior, Amy.
I can't believe this is how I choose to spend my days off.
What thanks do I get for saving you from the bus?
I'll put you in my liner notes one day.
Are you gonna tell me about your dad?
I heard he called you.
I wasn't planning on it, but I guess my mom did, huh?
I think she just wanted to make sure everything's okay with you.
So, is everything all right?
Have you been watching lifetime or something?
I know things are weird with you and your dad.
I want you to know that you can talk to me about it if you want to.
Trust me.
I know how it feels.
I hated my dad until, like, this morning.
I don't hate him.
So, what's the problem?
It just sucks how things are with him and my mom.
I know he was a crappy husband to her, but he wasn't a bad dad.
And we actually got along pretty good when he was home.
So you want to see him?
I didn't say that.
Relax.
You're not on trial.
I'm just asking.
Would you want to?
It doesn't matter.
Going to see my dad would be like treason or something.
I can't do that to my mom.
What if she doesn't know about it?
You mean, like, lie?
No, I mean, like, spare her feelings.
He's your dad.
You have a right to see him if you want to.
Your mom doesn't have to be in the middle of it.
If that's something you wanted to do,
I could go with you.
You want to meet my dad?
No, I don't have to meet him, but I could give you a ride.
Besides, it wouldn't feel right if I didn't spend every free moment driving you around.
I could get you a chauffeur's cap.
Cover up that mop you call hair.
Hey, babe.
Lasagna tonight.
Oh, man, that looks amazing, but
I don't know if I'm gonna have time to sit down with you guys.
Really?
Why not?
'Cause I have to go to that N.A. meeting.
Oh.
Oh, I thought that was just last night.
No, actually I'm supposed to go every night this week.
Did I not tell you that?
- Did you?
I'm sorry.
I totally --
- Maybe I didn't.
But I'll be here tomorrow night because
I'm gonna try and switch to morning meetings from now on.
Okay, well, whatever works best for you.
Okay.
And I kind of can't have this, either.
Really?
It's not like you had a drinking problem.
Or did you ?
No, I didn't.
Not at all.
But if I'm gonna follow the program, then I shouldn't have any of that stuff.
Kind of a slippery slope, you know?
Of course.
That makes total, total sense.
I'm so sorry.
I just -
- I didn't know.
Stop apologizing.
It's not a big deal.
It's just a couple adjustments here and there.
But nothing that we can't handle, right?
Right.
- Okay, I should get going.
- Okay.
An hour there and an hour back, so...
We'll have a warm plate waiting for you.
Okay.
Save me a corner piece, buddy.
- Have a good meeting.
- Okay, thank you.
How long is Jake not gonna have dinner with us?
That's a good question, sweetie.
I have no idea.
Good morning, Nina.
Going to work, huh?
Thinking about it.
Something wrong?
Sam okay?
Oh, Sam's great.
Little bit of a transition period with Jake.
I guess it's to be expected.
Everything got turned on its head there.
But, you know, he's trying, and I'm trying, and everybody is trying.
Tell me you can be five minutes late.
I can be five minutes late.
Okay.
So, what's the problem?
I'm the problem.
I don't know how to do this, Andy.
I...
I thought Jake would just come home, and I would be loving and supportive, and it would all magically be okay.
But I guess it doesn't work that way.
There's rules and steps.
There are 12 of them, but they take a while to climb.
I feel like I need to take a crash course to understand this stuff, and I don't want to keep doing the wrong thing.
I mean, I tried to give him a glass of wine last night.
Hmm.
That's not such a good idea.
Okay, see, I know that now.
Now I won't even keep cookies in the cookie jar 'cause I'm afraid sugar will be a gateway drug.
It's not funny.
I pulled him out of that rehab center and told him I'd get him through this, except I have no idea what I'm doing.
I need help.
- Okay.
- Okay, great.
So, you'll come over for dinner tonight?
We need to have one regular dinner with normal dinner conversation, at least until I have time to read up on this, on how I should be handling it.
Please say that you'll come tonight.
I can't.
I've got this thing with Delia and her rabbi.
Okay.
Well, how's tomorrow?
I pushed my original tonight to tomorrow night.
I'm begging you.
Well, I guess I could reschedule.
You're saving my life here.
Maybe Jake's, too.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
I'll see you tomorrow night.
Hey, dad.
Amy, have you watched this "Beauty and the Geek"?
This is truly fascinating stuff.
That's great, dad.
Do you have a minute?
Of course.
That's what tivo is for.
What can I do for you?
Okay.
Well, I have been talking with my professor, Laurie.
I told you about her, right?
On a thrice-daily basis, I believe.
Well, there's something big happening on campus, something that we could actually make a difference in, and I thought that maybe you could help.
I have been known to make an academic difference or two.
I once persuaded the dean of students to enforce a dress code in the dining hall.
Can you imagine people eating in their shorts?
Right.
Um... this has a little more to do with AM medical.
One of the doctors just retired, and he was the only one left who taught the abortion procedure to the med students.
I see.
And Laurie doesn't think that the board is gonna bother finding a replacement, at least not one who'd be willing to teach the procedure.
So, I thought, "why not you?"
Me?
Yeah.
I don't think it's gonna be time-consuming, if that's what you're worried about.
And it's not like you have to join the faculty.
I'm sorry.
I -
- I don't know why you would think
I would be qualified to teach something like that.
Well, are you saying that you're not?
Well, of course I'm not.
I've never performed an abortion, so I hardly seem like an appropriate candidate to be teaching that procedure.
I guess I just thought that you would know.
Sorry.
Won't be able to help you, sweetheart.
My favorite geek.
Join me?
So, what are we talking about here?
I've written a speech or two in my day.
They were usually about procedures to salvage the frontal lobe, but maybe we could steal something.
It has to fit the theme of my Torah portion.
Great.
What's the theme?
Delia's Bath Mitzvah takes place during the week of Kedoshim, so her Torah portion deals mostly with laws -- laws about the festivals and how you deal with the lepers and goats and scape goats.
I told you this was hard.
You didn't say there'd be goats.
There is also the law of love thy neighbor as yourself.
Pretty good one.
It makes more sense in today's society than the leper thing, unless, of course, you're in one of those colonies, you know?
Forgive me if you've done work in that area, doctor.
Love thy neighbor, huh?
I think I could work with that.
It's about me, not you, dad.
I know.
I'm just thinking out loud here, okay?
Forget it.
You probably don't remember too much from when I was a kid.
First of all, you're still a kid, at least until your Bath Mitzvah.
And second of all, I happen to remember a lot.
Like that trap you set for the tooth fairy that almost took my whole finger off.
Why would I want to kill the tooth fairy?
You didn't want to kill her.
You wanted to talk to her.
'Cause you thought she'd be pretty.
Don't you remember that tiara you made for?
I don't remember that.
Ow!
That's gonna be a bruise!
Are you okay?
You want to sit down or something?
Moving around helps me think.
Teeth, tiaras.
This is good stuff.
What about the time you broke your arm going down Mr. Cooper's fire escape?
I never broke my arm.
You're right.
That's right.
It was Lizzie Dean.
Patient of mine.
She hurt her head pretty bad when she fell.
That's why they brought her to me.
Great, maybe Lizzie Dean needs help with her Bath Mitzvah.
I once had a girlfriend named Lizzie.
Freckly thing.
Can we take a break, please?
She's right.
We've done enough for tonight.
Good call.
Go out on a high note.
Do you know what I like to do during the chilly months?
Eat ice cream.
I say we all go out and get a scoop.
Sounds good.
Where are my keys?
I'll drive.
Here.
You can have the rest.
Hey, listen, if you want me to help you with your speech later... or not.
You're gonna help Delia with her Bath Mitzvah speech?
You don't know what "Mazel Tov" means.
That's the cookie that tastes like biscotti, right?
Oh, no, no, that's mandel bread.
Sounds like Mazel Tov.
What class is all that stuff for?
Uh, it's for Kyle.
I'm trying to find him a Juilliard scholarship.
The Masons will pay a musician to go to school, but you can't contact them directly.
Sounds like you've put a lot of thought into it.
It's not like Kyle or his mom have the resources.
I got nothing else going on.
No, just your own life.
I thought we agreed I don't have a life.
You could if you didn't spend your time with a kid who doesn't pay for your services.
You've been treating half the town for three years for free.
I'm allowed one.
I'll give you 20 if you can tell me what this is about.
Why do I have to have a reason?
You don't.
No, I do have a reason.
I made a promise to your mother.
So what's your excuse?
Do I really have to explain this for you?
Social leper, piano prodigy, issues with his dad.
Does it sound familiar?
Look, Ephram, I get that you relate to the kid, but I'm just worried about you.
One week you're making his audition tape, and the next you're helping him figure out how to pay for it.
Isn't it painful giving the life that you should have?
It's not like I was robbed.
I chose not to go to Juilliard.
You could change your mind.
Instead of working on your own stuff, you're spending all your time and energy on Kyle.
It's like setting up one of your friends with Amy for a date.
It's nothing like that.
Are you kidding me?
Okay, you don't understand.
As messed up as I was last year, Kyle is worse.
And he's about to be more upset for something that'll end up being my fault.
It's your fault if Juilliard rejects him?
No, it's my fault if his dad rejects him.
The guy is in town for a couple of days.
He wants to see Kyle.
Kyle wants to see him.
So I tell him to go for it.
Seems like the right thing to do, right?
Who knows what a jerk his dad is?
Maybe he wants to see him so he can tell him he's getting remarried or that he's going to Iraq.
What if those things are true?
What has that got to do with you?
I'm the one who told him to go do it.
Why are you not getting this?
No, no, I'm trying to.
I don't understand what this kid's problems have to do with your life.
Okay, you know what?
I didn't ask for your opinion.
Why don't you go back to online dating?
And I'm gonna go handle a tortured teenager.
- He's not here yet.
- We're still early.
Okay, well, thanks.
Are you sure you don't want me to hang out?
I could sit over there.
I'm actualy lind of hungry.
No, it's cool.
You could leave if you want.
I don't want you to be stuck without a ride.
It's fine.
You know what?
I'm gonna hang out.
I'll sit over there.
You won't even know I'm here.
You're weird, you know that?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
Hey, so, I talked to my dad.
Oh, fantastic.
What did he say?
I didn't really go the way I planned.
He told me he doesn't know how to do it.
I thought you said he did.
I know.
I think I -
- I guess I was wrong.
Amy, I've lost two days on this.
Why would you think--
It's all right.
You know what?
Never mind.
Doesn't matter.
- Professor Fields?
- Yes?
Do you mind going over that essay with me now?
Sure.
Walk with me to my office.
Unless there's something else?
Nope.
Hey.
Just checking in.
We can stay here.
Whatever you want to do.
It's up to you.
It's late, huh?
It's been a little while, yeah.
Yeah.
Whatever you want to do is fine with me.
Just let me--
He's not coming, is he?
I don't know what to tell you, Kyle.
I'm sorry.
Let's just go.
Fancy stuff here, babe.
What's the occasion?
No occasion.
Just some new recipes I wanted to try.
Hope you like the potatoes.
So, how's work, Jake?
Actually it's been pretty slow.
I've cut back on my hours.
I'm not doing much of the minor stuff anymore.
Hey, you and Hal should pick up some botox clients.
It's pretty simple stuff.
A chimp could do it.
That's not true.
Your work is very challenging, sweetheart.
How are you otherwise?
Uh... well, actually I've been a little off, if you wanna know the truth.
Which is completely normal -- normal to feel that way.
You know, studies say it's all about the first 30 days.
Studies?
I picked up a few books.
I thought they might help... me.
Not you.
You don't need help.
I mean, obviously you need help, but not from me or my books.
Unless... do you want my books?
Uh... how about you, Sam?
What's new?
I got yelled at for eating boogers in class today.
Excellent.
Oh, Andy, I'm sorry.
I forgot to offer you some wine.
You drink red, right?
Yeah, I love red.
Uh, we don't have any wine, actually.
Seriously?
Oh, I don't need any.
You didn't have to throw away the wine.
I just thought it would be easier this way.
Maybe I don't need it, either.
I think I'm having a reaction to tannins anyway.
You know, I thought that we would just... have this instead.
Who wants cider?
Me!
Okay.
Any for you, Andy?
I'm good.
All righty.
Oopsy.
Oh, good, you're here.
Taste this.
I'm working my way through Julia's cookbook.
Tonight we trying coq au vin.
I told Laurie that you couldn't help out, which was really humiliating since I thought that you would.
I'm sorry that you couldn't present me to your teacher like a bright, shiny apple, but I can hardly be blamed for your jumping to conclusions.
I didn't make that jump out of nowhere, dad.
I know you've done it before.
I saw your name on a file at the clinic.
You've performed an abortion before.
More than once, so...
So, you've seen?
You lied to me.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
But I want you to know that I've never lied to you before.
Why would you choose now to start, especially since this is something that we agree on?
Sweetheart, we don't agree on this.
I don't work at the clinic anymore.
I haven't in almost two years, and I don't plan to return.
Why not?
You have to understand.
This was a promise that I made to my father as I stepped into a role that he created... back when the options available to women were much more limited than they are today.
So, I did what I had to in his name, all right?
In his name only.
But I cannot go to your university and invite others into a nightmare that I still haven't made my own peace with.
So, you don't think it should be legal?
Oh, heavens, I can't get into that.
And you probably think that what I've been doing with my time is --
Sweetheart, I think it is wonderful that you've gotten so involved in a cause that you care so passionately about.
But you think it's the wrong cause.
Your opinions are your own, Amy.
That's the beauty of forming them.
I can't take that away from you.
But you'd probably be a lot happier if you had someone like Hannah for a daughter?
What?
Honey, that's ridiculous.
You'd agree on everything, talk the things that you have in common, like how you both think I'm a terrible person for what I believe in.
Sweetheart, stop.
I do not for a moment think you are a terrible person.
I'm sure that Hannah doesn't, either.
Hannah and I haven't talked in two weeks, so you don't know what she thinks.
I'm sorry.
I was not aware that you girls were having problems.
It must be difficult to be swimming against the tide of those closest to you.
I just never thought I would have to.
Amy.
This is a nice surprise.
Hi, dad.
You want to, uh, go into my office?
I don't have another patient for a little while.
We could continue our discussion from last night perhaps, now that our emotions have quieted a bit.
Actually, my emotions are right where they were.
I don't see them quieting any time soon.
I see.
And we really don't need to discuss anything.
I mean, we disagree.
Let's just leave it at that, okay?
Um... is he here?
Oh, Dr. Brown?
He's running a bit late.
But you can wait in his office, if you like.
Okay, thanks, Louise.
You're going to ask Dr. Brown about the AM position?
Just trying to swim in the right circles.
That's all.
Hi, Andy.
Hey.
You going to work?
Thinking about it.
Could you be five minutes late?
You know, I can't, Jake.
I'm sorry.
Three minutes?
It's about Nina.
You don't say.
I know she talked to you about me.
She told you?
Oh, please.
It was so obvious.
Look, Nina just came to me out of concern for you, Jake.
I knew it.
She's freaking out, right?
I'm freaking her out?
She wants to help you, Jake.
Nina likes to think of the world as an ideal place.
And if it's not, she'll try and fix whatever is broken.
Right now she thinks that you're broken.
Well, that would explain the pamphlets in my dob kit.
It's sweet that she wants to be helpful, but I don't think
I can handle her micromanaging my recovery process.
Hey, maybe you could talk to her, just get her to ease off.
No, I can't do that.
Why not?
Because I've got my own life to fix.
I got a daughter who won't talk to me, not even in hebrew.
My son is taking on the weight of the world for reasons I still don't understand.
And I just blew a chance to spend the entire night with a contortionist!
- Really?
- Yeah!
- That's a bummer.
- Yeah!
And most of all, I cannot be the guy to save your relationship with Nina.
Oh, man.
I'm sorry.
I totally missed that.
I'm an idiot.
Look, I got to go to work.
I got some heads to examine.
Particularly my own.
Absolutely.
Have a good day, buddy.
Oh, hey, Josh.
Come on in.
Sit down.
I prefer to stand.
It's not bad news, Josh.
Please, sit.
Do you remember when you got that C.A.T. scan?
How could I forget?
They slapped 40 electrodes on me and made copious notes.
And those hurt when they come off, just so you know.
Well, yeah, that was the quantitative EEG.
It's what we call brain mapping, and basically it measures your alpha-wave activity.
And when that's particularly high, it could be an indication of a certain condition.
Death?
Who was your doctor back in New York?
I didn't have one.
All right.
Who was your pediatrician?
I didn't have one of those, either.
My family is kind of wonky about doctors.
What did you do when you got sick?
My mom always said that doctors look for problems that don't really exist 'cause that's their job.
Ergo, if I never went to a doctor, nothing would ever be wrong with me.
Well... that's an interesting philosophy.
It's totally psychotic, I know.
Which is why I was so happy when I got health insurance through my school.
You're my first doctor ever.
I wish I had known this earlier.
All this time I've been looking for a complex problem, and, in fact, I think your issue is pretty simple.
That's probably why we missed it.
Because I'm slow?
My mom could've told you that.
She always said I was a stain on the stein family.
She's particularly fond of that little catchphrase.
You're not slow, Josh.
You have adult A.D.D. --
Attention Deficit Disorder.
It often goes undiagnosed or, in your case, misdiagnosed as a stain on the steins.
No... way.
Yep.
That's why you have trouble following through things, focusing for long periods of time, staying in your own lane.
Wow.
Wow!
You don't understand.
You just gave me 29 years worth of comebacks.
This is awesome!
Well, it's going to take a little work on your part.
I'm gonna put you on some medication.
But more importantly, I want you to start these therapeutic exercises.
I printed those for you.
I-I just -
- I can't believe it.
You spend a lifetime worrying that you're dying, and you just don't know it.
Then you find out that not only are you not dying, but your whole miserable existence didn't have to be miserable if only you weren't so afraid to peel back the onion and maybe get a checkup every once in a while!
Fear makes people do very silly things.
You know what?
You are going to make a terrific rabbi, Josh.
I sure hope so.
Hey.
Hope you don't mind.
Your mom told me to come right up.
Have we talked about the state of your room?
Because this prison vibe you got going on is a little grim.
Want to show you something.
What is it?
Well, it turns out there's an artistically frustrated rich guy living in Colorado who is desperate to pay some kid's tuition to Juilliard.
You fit the bill perfectly.
It's not like it matters anyway.
I probably won't even get in.
I don't believe you think that for a second, the way you've been strutting around all year.
You have a shot.
Why change your mind now?
Okay.
Never mind.
I know why.
You can't let what happened mess with your head.
I'm sorry I pushed you into it.
You didn't.
I thought it was a good idea -- me and my awesome dad spending time together like the old days.
You must think I'm so stupid.
No, I don't.
Well, I am.
I just keep forgiving him.
When he says he's gonna call, he doesn't.
He says he'll meet me for lunch, and he doesn't show.
The guy bought me some piece-of-crap keyboard eight years ago, and I think he's the greatest dad ever.
That doesn't make you stupid.
That makes you human.
He's your father.
You're programmed to love him.
I hate him.
Why would he do that?
Why would he just leave like that and never want to see me again?
I don't understand.
I don't know.
What he did was awful.
You have a right to be pissed at him as long as you want.
But you can't give up on your dreams because you're mad.
- Why not?
- Because I did that.
I blamed my dad for messing up my shot.
At the end of the day...
I did it all by myself.
You're better than that.
You're better than me.
Only at piano.
Fill that out for me.
You'll be all right.
Hey.
Keep on forgetting that you get home early now.
Little light reading there?
Yeah.
So, Sam and I will just order chinese while you're at your meeting tonight.
I'll get you sesame noodles since they're better cold anyway.
You don't have to do that.
It's no problem.
Babe, I got to talk to you about something.
Okay.
I'm not going to go to the meetings anymore.
What?
Why?
That sounds bad.
No, I'm not falling off the wagon or depressed or anything like that.
It's because N.A. didn't work for me before, and it isn't working now.
Some people heal themselves through prayer and being anonymous.
I need to be a little more active than that.
Does that make any sense?
I don't know.
I've only been covering the N.A. angle.
I don't know about the other stuff.
What it means is I actually want it to work this time, but I have to do it my own way.
Okay, so, which way is that?
Well, I don't really know yet.
I have to figure that out.
But I don't need you to make this place recovery central on my account.
I asked you to come here.
You didn't force me to do that.
You had no idea what you were getting into.
Now you do.
And if it's too much...
I'd understand.
It's not too much.
I guess I just don't know how to help you without taking it on myself.
I don't need you to take it on.
I don't want you spending your free time reading self-help books.
There's a reason that they call them "self-help" books.
You just need to be you, and I'll be me, and we'll see how it goes.
So, how do I be me?
Live a little.
I was just going to my room.
I didn't mean to bother you.
Can I read you something?
I've been working on my speech.
It's rough.
But I don't have to give it for three months, so we have some time.
I'll keep that in mind.
"In the week of Kedoshim, God sets forth laws that teach ushow to be honest and fair.
One of the laws tells us not to turn to ghosts.
That's the law I want to talk about today."
Great beginning.
Very clear.
"When we first moved to this town, my dad and I were both turning to one ghost a lot -- my mom.
For a long time, we were counting on her to tell us what to do.
My dad even tried to talk to her.
But she couldn't answer anymore, so we finally had to turn away.
And that's when we started over.
I didn't know my dad very much when I was little, but now he does everything for me.
Since we've been here, he's thrown birthday parties, and he's learned how to cook.
He tried to take me camping.
He found me a rabbi in Colorado, which was really hard.
And I know things about him now, too.
I know that sometimes he's sad, and sometimes he's lonely.
Even though we fight a lot, it's better than when we turned to the ghost.
Because now we have each other."
How did you come up with that?
I kept trying to think back to the beginning.
But when I just started writing about the stuff that happened here, it was so much easier.
Yeah.
Sometimes we miss the obvious stuff.
Obviously.
Come here.
- Professor Fields?
- Yeah.
I was wondering, did Andy Brown get in touch with you?
Yeah, I met him earlier.
Thank you so much for sending him our way.
No worries.
Is he gonna do it?
I don't know.
He's gonna meet with the board tomorrow.
We've got a few strong candidates now, so something is bound to work out.
Good.
I'm so relieved.
I was really scared that I messed things up.
You were just being enthusiastic.
You were right, though.
I was so excited about getting involved,
I wasn't thinking.
Man, you were raised well.
Your dad must be so proud of you.
Except for the bleeding-heart liberal stuff, right?
Yeah, right.
So, how come you never told me that Dr. Brown was so sexy?
Oh.
I never really thought about it until now.
Now I feel weird.
Hey.
I wasn't expecting you tonight.
You want to practice?
I could get out of your way.
I didn't want to go back to my place yet.
I'd ask why, but history shows you're not too fond of that question.
I don't know what I'm doing with this Kyle thing.
Forcing him into this thing has turned out to be a bigger nightmare than I could've imagined.
The guy didn't even show up.
Oh, no.
I'm sorry, Ephram.
I'm the one who should be sorry.
You were right.
I just ended up making it worse for Kyle.
You didn't.
His father might have.
Yeah, but if I hadn't pushed him, he never would've known what a jerk his father was.
Now he has to deal with it.
He's gonna have to deal with it eventually.
At least he had you there while it happened.
Maybe you helped to cushion the blow.
I don't know if you can cushion something like this.
I mean, who does that?
Who abandons their son right before they head into the most confusing time of their life?
I don't know.
That's what he's gonna think.
The baby, my baby, is gonna think that I abandoned him.
Is that what this has all been about?
I don't know, maybe.
I saw this kid who looked like he needed somebody.
I thought maybe that should be my responsibility.
Maybe I'd ease my guilt a little bit along the way.
You have nothing to feel guilty about.
You didn't abandon anyone.
You didn't even know about him.
Yeah, I know that, you know that, but he'll never know that.
There's nobody there to tell him the truth.
He'll think that I didn't want him, that I didn't love him.
And then one day he'll come looking for me.
He might.
I think about it all the time.
It's like it might be 10, 20 years, but I'm always gonna be waiting for that knock.
And when it comes,
I have no idea what I'm gonna say.
You'll just tell him the truth.
From the heart.
It's weird, missing something that you never even had.
Now I know how Kyle must've felt.
It's like there's this hole in my life, and I can't --
Sometimes I have to make stuff up just to get through the bad times.
For a while.
But then the hole fills up with other things.
But it takes some time.
And every once in a while you remember what caused it, but it won't hurt the same.
If anything, it'll remind you how far you've come.
How will I know when that happens?
I don't know.
But I'll be there for you until it does.

Well, I left a note withour address on it.
It should be too hardto get in touch with us.
Well, I hope they'renot too upset about this.
Well,it's a hell of a wayto meet your neighbors.
That's weird.
Well, maybe the guy'sa bricklayer or something.

I've got a fresh potof coffee brewing.
Sure.
And... here we are.
-I love your house.-Thank you.
Did your wifedecorate it herself?
Uh, no.
I'm afraidI'm just an old bachelor.
But I did it all myself.
-Oh!
Impressive.-Yeah.
If I had to decorateour place by myself, it would look likesquatters had moved in.
Cream or sugar?
Oh, I'd love somecream, thank you.
You?
Nothing for me,thanks.
So, uh, what line ofwork are you in?
I'm a type ofindependent salesman.
It's kind of hard to explain.
I guess I make huntingand fishing licenses.
Hey, that's great.I love hunting.
Maybe you could help meget a license.
I don't actuallymake or sell the licenses.
I develop this exoticplastic film that the licensesare printed on.
It's really a specificline of work, and most peopledon't quite get it, but...
I like it.
It allows me to workout of the house--which I love.
I couldn't agree more.I love it.
No co-workers,no bosses.
What kind of workdo you do?
Investigative reporter.
Mostly freelance work.
I swear,she is part bloodhound.
She can track downthe smallest lead.
It sounds likea fascinating job.
Actually, it's kind ofboring work, but sometimes ithas its rewards.
And what do you do?
I'm an er doctor.
You must have startedschool very young.

I'm older than I look,trust me.
-Are you alreadyworking here?

Yeah.

There's too muchcrime and traffic.
It wasn't safe anywhere.
David has a reallysmall penis.

Nice and thickand long, isn't it?
I would suck your cock until you came so good.
I'm a little deaf in this ear.
Oh, I--I was just saying how sorry we areabout your mailbox.
You have beenso nice about it.
Please, it's just nothing.
It gave me something to do.
Well, we were impressed at how quicklyyou fixed it.
I do get up very early.
And I had some bricksand mortar laying around.
I've been doing some landscaping workin my free time.
I would feela lot better if you let mewrite you a check, huh?
Absolutely not.
Accidents happen, and... well, if you ask me,
I built that mailbox waytoo close to the curb anyway.
We should get going.
We have a millionthings to do.
I bet you do.
Now, are you sure thatwe can't get you something?

"A little boy used to come on tiptoeto the window
"and watch chip as he flew inand out of the vine, bringing worms to nip."
You sure seem to get along wellwith the new neighbors.
Well... that husband isa complete waste of skin, but I kinda like her.
Celia.
It's a pretty name,don't you think?
I know what you're thinking, and I'd stop it right nowif I were you.

We don't need any morefamily members.
We have enough.
Well, I agree.
But, daddy, you saidgrandma's gonna come soon.
Oh, she is, honey.
Mom and I are talking about somethingcompletely different.
You sound likeyou're jealous.
It's not thatI'm attracted to her.
-Yes, you are.-No, I'm not.
It's too closeto home, harold.
It's too risky.
I think that husbandsaw the bones.
You want to thinkhe saw the bones.
You know he didn'T.
I don't know how hecould have missed 'em.
It was dark.He was probably drunk.
You saw how bloodshot his eyes were whenthey came over here.
And if they did, they wouldn't have come over hereto have coffee with you.
He'd have gone to the police.
All that crapabout crime in L.A.
Well, L.A.'Snot that bad.
It's where I met you.
You should becareful with them.
There's something brewingbehind those eyes.
He could bedangerous to you.

How long did youlive in L.A.?
Uh, a couple of years,roughly.
Yeah.

Didn't work out.
And why did youleave L.A.?
Following another woman?
No.
No.

Just a-- just a--yeah, thank you.
I...
Really like it here.You know?
It's-- it's quiet.And it's peaceful.
And, uh, I thinkit's perfect for children.
It really is.
You know, um-- that's the whole reason thatwe moved back here, actually.
Yeah!
So that we couldhave little babies.
You thinking ofstarting a family soon?
Yeah, actually, wealready started a family.
But it, um--it got stopped.
Yeah.
We, um-- we had a child.Uh, a daughter.
But, um, she died.
Cancer.
That's just awful.
Yep.

Perfect.
The great and powerfulharold has returned.
Do we really have todo this this evening?
You know we do.
So... did you have a good time with your littlewhore tonight?
Don't you dare talkabout her like that.
Or what?
You couldn'tlive without me.
I was your first.
You were not my first.
And you know whathappened to my first.
They were her bonesyou hid in the mailbox.
That's right.
But I was the one youstarted this family with.
Daddy, why areyou and mommy fighting?
Because your daddydoesn't love me anymore.
-He's gonna replace me.-Stop it, jane.
Would you pleasejust stop it?
He's gonna replaceall of us.
All right.
That is it!
I have just abouthad it with you!
You're nuts!

Absolutely fucking nuts.
Come on, honey.
And...there you go.
Into bed.
Daddy, I'm scared.
Oh, there's nothingto be scared of.
You're not gonnareplace me, are you, daddy?
No.
I could neverreplace you.

I love you more thananything in the whole world.
I love you, too, daddy.
Oh, thank you.

How 'bout a big sister?
Ha ha.
All right, honey.I'll try to get one as soon as I can.
But, now, you needto close your eyes.
It's night-night time.
I could be your daughter.
You could come into myroom late at night, and--
I do a lot of drugs.
And I fuck anythingthat moves.
But you could save me.
I need a real father to--
Tiffany!
No one will miss me.
I hate my life.
I'd be better off with you.
Come take me.
I won't put up muchof a fight.
I'll be a good big sister to sarah.
I know what it's like to be lonely.
I probably won't even scream.
I'll be grateful.
I'll have someone to love me.
Someone to find--
Oh, no!
Are you sureyou should get up?
No, no, no!
I am so sorry!
I didn't see you!
You know, it's those hedges?
Those damn hedges?
I kept telling them,trim the hedges!
Oh, my god!
Look,I have insurance.
Oh, my god.That cut looks so bad.Should I call an ambulance?
Yeah-
- I'm gonna call it.You need an ambulance.
-I think I'm all right.-It's okay!
Don't worry about it--
I kept telling them to trimthose fucking hedges!
It would havebeen beautiful.
Could youcall the ambulance!
But it justwasn't meant to be.
Calling dr.
Howard.
Calling dr.
Fine.
Harold?
What are you doing here?
What happened?
Oh, uh, a car accident.
It's no big deal.
It's just a fender-bender.But, uh-- well, come with me.I'll take care of ya.
I'm not quite finishedfilling out-- don't-- don't worryabout that.
I can't let you sit outhere and bleed to death.
Celia would never forgive me.
Thank you.
Well, it's a pretty nasty cut.
But it's not as badas it looks.
It's not even gonnarequire stitches.
see...no signsof a concussion.
Well, you really lucked outon this one, harold.
You know, I've always beensort of lucky that way.
Never been seriouslyill, or injured.
I don't think I've ever even spenta night in a hospital.
Take it from me:
Like thateventually runs out.
So, uh...how are thingswith you and celia?
Excuse me?
Are you gettingsettled in?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Since I came back to work, she's been...dealing with the house.
Well, you are the lucky one,to have a wife like her.
You don'tknow the half of it.
Well, there we are,harold.
Good as new.
Well, thank you.
I'd still be out in the waiting room,if it wasn't for you.
Oh, no.
It's my pleasure.
Besides, like I said,celia would never forgive me if I let anythinghappen to you.
There we go.
celia.
celia, wake up, baby.
I need totell you something.
What?
What's wrong?
Well, I've beenthinking, and...
I think you're right.
I'm not gonnafight it any more.
I'm ready to do it.
All of it.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
He doesn't deserve her.
It's you that cangive her the family she wants.
I know.
But jane might be right.
It's too risky,so close to home.
You shouldn'tlisten to jane.
You should listento your heart, son.
Is everything all right?
I saw a police carout here, earlier.
David'sdisappeared.
How long hashe been gone?
Since yesterday morning.
Well, what didthe police say?
They took a report, butthey don't think he's missing.
They think he left me.
I mean, we have beenfighting a lot lately, but--
He wouldn't do that.He wouldn'T.
******
Everything's gonnabe just fine.
******
*****
*****
*****
I've been waitingfor this.
Now that you'vekilled david, you're gonnareplace me with her.
I didn't do anythingto david.
He left her.
You aresuch a liar.
You know I didn'tdo anything to david, but you can't accept that.
You can't accept thatit's fate that sent david away, and that it's proofthat celia and i are meant for each other.
She'll never love you.
Yes...she...will!
Now the police stillhaven't found anything?
It's been a full seven days,and nothing.
Not one sign of him.Not a clue.
'Course, I don't knowhow hard they're looking, seeing as they thinkthat he'S...
left me.
Well, how are youholding up?
I haven't been able to work.
I...cry myselfto sleep every night.
Feel like I'mlosing my mind.
Have you been outof the house at all?
I-
- I'm too scared to leave.
I could miss a callfrom the police, from david.
Well, you need to get outof the house for awhile.
It's just not healthyfor you to stay cooped up like thisall the time.
I know.But I, um...
I don't know what to do with myself any more.I'm a wreck.
You look like you haven'thad a decent meal in days.
Why don't you come over tomy house for dinner tonight?
That's really sweetof you, harold.
Um...but I-
- I reallyshould stay here.
I'm sure david wouldn't liketo see you sitting around, wasting away like this.
You need a goodhome-cooked meal.
No, I-
- I need to be herein case someone calls.
Bring your cell phone.
Oh, come on.
It'll getyour mind off things.
Here's what you do.You take yourself a nice, hot, long shower.
You get into somefresh clothes.
And come on overto my house, and let me get somefood into you.

So...am I gonna getthe full tour this time?
You certainly are.
But a little later.After dinner.
Well, I-
- I didn't realizethat it was gonna be so formal.
Oh.
I guess I got a littleexcited about having company.
Frankly, it's been a while.
Oh...well,you look very nice.
Thank you.
Uh...do you mind ifI have a smoke in here?
Uh...kinda preferyou didn'T.
Well, uh...you mind ifI step outside, then?
Uh...could it wait?
'Cause dinner'salmost ready.
Well, I hope thisis all right.
I don't get the chanceto entertain that much, so...
I tend to goa little bit overboard.
No.
No.It's very nice.
Well...allow me.
-okay.
Thank you-You're welcome.
-Some wine?
-Uh, please.
Now I want you to sit hereand enjoy your wine, while I go get usthe rest of our dinner.
You're very quietthis evening.
You usually asklots of questions.
I'm sorry.
I'm not verygood company tonight.
I--
I can't help butwonder where david is.
Yeah.
Let's not talkabout david tonight.
I mean, there's no sense upsetting youwhile you're eating.
That's very badfor the digestion.
And, uh-- how is everything?
Delicious.
Um... really, you shouldn't havegone to all this trouble.
Nonsense.
I wanted to dosomething nice for you.
You deserve someonewho does nice things for you.
More wine?
No, thank you.I think I've had enough.
What, are you pickingtonight to get sober?
What did you just say?
That didn't come outvery well.
That was a bad joke.
I--
I'm so sorry.
I'M...stuffed.
You're stuffed?
You've hardly eaten a thing.
I'm sorry.Everything was delicious.
I-
- I just don't havemuch of an appetite.
I don't want anymore food, harold.
I want you.
I want you, inside me.Right now.
Right here.
On this table.
What did you say?
I said I really appreciatedinner, but, um...
-I should be going.-No, wait!
Wait!
Uh-- we haven't evenhad dessert yet!
And I have a-- a wonderfulbottle of champagne I was just about to open.
I gotta be honestwith you, harold.
I don't feel comfortablewith all of this.
I-
- I'm a married woman.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't get the wrongimpression now.
I wanna be your friend.Nothing more.
Well, uh, this is coming off asromantic, not friendly.
Well, sure.
I broke outall the good stuff to impress you,not seduce you.
You've been througha very hard time, lately.
I wanted you to be ableto enjoy yourself this evening.
I'm-
- I'm sorry.
Of course you did.
I, um-
- I'm just--
I'm a complete messright now.
It's perfectlyunderstandable.
You've been throughan awful lot.
I-- now I reallyshould go.
Oh, no.
We can't leaveit like this.
I tell you what.
We'll skip the champagneand go straight for dessert.
I bought a fantasticraspberry tort.
It would be a shameto waste it.
That sounds good.
-All right.I'll go get it.-No, no, no, no.
Please, finish.Finish your dinner.
Oh, no.
If I eat any more,I won't want dessert.
Be right back.
Ah...
I don'tmean to be rude,but I am goingto skip dessert.
Are you sure?
Look at this.
Tempting.
But, uh, I'm reallynot in the mood.
What I need isa cigarette.
Okay, why don't yougo out on the back porch and have your cigarette?
-You sure you don't mind?
-Yes.
No.
I'm fine.
I'll save this for later.
All right, you go aheadand have a smoke, and I shall startclearing the dishes.
Much, much better now.
Well, good.
So, how aboutthat grand tour?
Sure.
-Are these bedrooms?
-Yes, they are.
And I'llshow you those later, but first I'd like toshow you my favorite room.
This is whereI spend most of my time.
Do you likeyour new family, celia?
You see, I cangive you what david won'T.
-Help!
-Come on, celia.
- No!
-You're gonna beso happy here.
I'm gonna takesuch good ca--
I'm so sorry.Are you all right?
You weres-supposed to leave the back door unlocked.
I thought it'd be betterto take him in here.
Hey, let me see.Let me see.
Can you swallow?
Well, it doesn'tlook that bad.
Are you all right?
She's upstairs.
She's wearingthe same green dress.
The same green dress.
The hellis going on here?
My husband always saidI was part bloodhound.
It turns out he was right.I tracked you down.
It took her a long time,but she finally did it.
What are you--
you killed our daughter,you son of a bitch.
You said your daughterdied from cancer.
You are a fucking cancer.
What are you gonna do?
We're gonna kill you.
But first, we're gonnamake you experience every bit of painyou've ever caused.
Yeah, but someone'sgonna realize I'm gone, and then two missing personson one street?
That's gonnaraise suspicion?
We never fileda missing persons report.
We calledto report that someone had been lurking around in our backyard,you fucking pervert.
It's all been a set up, in case you haven'tfigured it out.
Hitting your mailboxwas no accident.
We've been planning thisfor a long time.
I don't knowwhy I was so hesitant.
You're right,it feels so good.
Yeah, it's strange,isn't it?
We were neverviolent people... until you took our daughteraway from us.
I don't know about you,but I'm gettingready for bed.
Me, too.
But I don'treally wanna stop.
I'm thinking about maybe startingthat family of ours.
I love you, david.
I love you,too, baby.
I think I can keep him alivemaybe 10 or 14 days.
I know his blood hath made me whole
I know his blood hath made me whole if I touched the hem of his garment
I know his blood hath made me whole well, I know his blood done made me whole well, you know his blood has made me whole well, if I touched the hem of his garment well, you know his blood

Sorry, dad.
Time for lunch.
-Hey, honey.
-Hi, honey.
Well, I think we got some new neighbors moving in over at the Harper's old place.
Oh, yeah?
That's good.
Maybe they'll be quieter than the Harpers were.
Coming and going at all hours of the night.
Sarah, honey, you're sitting too close to the television.
I've told you.
You're gonna ruin your eyes.
You have to move back.
There you go.
When is grandpa gonna get here?
Oh, just another day or two.
So soon?
Yeah, it's not taking anywhere near as long as I thought it would.
Soup?
No.
I'm fine.
You sure?
It's really good.
'Cause I can...
Oh, I'll eat later.
Found another kitchen box in the bedroom.
Well, so much for labelling everything for the movers.
I fucking hate moving!
Why are you so uptight?
I don't know.
I just...
What?
What is it?
I just thought that I would feel different now that we've moved here, but I don't.
I still feel unsure and... scared.
Hey, this is a new start for us,
- a new beginning.
- I know.
I just...
I can't help thinking that this might all be a huge mistake.
You're just tired.
Why don't we stop for a while and go grab a bite to eat?
- A drink would be better.
- Okay, how about both?
Where are we?
We're almost home.
Jeez, those two glasses of wine really put you down.
Hon, I'm not usually such a lightweight.
Well... the move's been hard on you.
What about you?
You sure were sucking back those Martinis.
Liquid courage.
It's gonna be all right.
You'll see.
You all right?
Yeah, I think so.
Are you?
Yeah.
Oh, boy.
I can't believe that didn't wake anyone up!
Somebody had to have heard that, right?
Well, what should we do?
- Come on.
- Wait, wait, wait.
I should get my insurance card.
Is anyone home or...
I don't know.
Hmm.
Well, I guess I'll just leave a note, then.
Da...
David?
Well, I left a note with our address on it.
It shouldn't be too hard to get in touch with us.
Well, I hope they're not too upset about this.
Well, it's a hell of a way to meet your neighbors.
That's weird.
Well, maybe the guy's a bricklayer or something.
Well, he must have gotten the note I left 'cause it's not here.
Or maybe we just dreamed the whole thing.
Uh, can I help you?
I'm David Fuller.
- This is my wife Celia.
- Hi.
- Harold Thompson.
- Nice to meet you.
Unfortunately, we're the ones that hit your mailbox last night.
Would you like to come inside?
I've got a fresh pot of coffee brewing.
Sure.
And...
Here we are.
- I love your house.
- Thank you.
Did your wife decorate it herself?
Uh, no.
I'm afraid I'm just an old bachelor.
But I did it all myself.
- Oh!
Impressive.
- Yeah.
If I had to decorate our place by myself, it would look like squatters had moved in.
Cream or sugar?
Oh, I'd love some cream, thank you.
You?
Nothing for me, thanks.
So, uh, what line of work are you in?
I'm a type of independent salesman.
It's kind of hard to explain.
I guess I make hunting and fishing licenses.
Hey, that's great.
I love hunting.
Maybe you could help me get a license.
I don't actually make or sell the licenses.
I develop this exotic plastic film that the licenses are printed on.
It's really a specific line of work, and most people don't quite get it, but...
I like it.
It allows me to work out of the house... which I love.
I couldn't agree more.
I love it.
No co-workers, no bosses.
What kind of work do you do?
Investigative reporter.
Mostly freelance work.
I swear, she is part bloodhound.
She could track down the smallest lead.
It sounds like a fascinating job.
Actually, it's kind of boring work, but sometimes it has its rewards.
- And what do you do?
- I'm an ER doctor.
You must have started school very young.
No.
I'm older than I look, trust me.
- Are you already working here?
- Oh, no, not yet.
I'm taking a little time off before I start over at Westfall.
Westfall?
Very good hospital.
Is that what brought you two all the way from California?
Yeah.
That and a few other things.
You must have family here, then.
No.
Both of our parents died a long time ago.
Yeah, but we figured this would be a great place to start a family of our own.
How did you know that we came out from California?
- She is a reporter, right?
- Yeah.
See?
What did I tell ya?
She'll grill you, man.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's... oh...
No, no, no.
I saw your license plates.
I used to live in California myself.
In the L.A. area.
You know, I'm not really sexually or emotionally satisfied.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, I just said where in L.A. did you live?
- Burbank.
- Mmm!
That is crazy!
We lived right down the road in Studio city!
Wow.
It is a small world.
I'll tell you, we are so glad to be out of there, though.
There's too much crime and traffic.
It wasn't safe anywhere.
David has a really small penis.
I bet yours is big.
Nice and thick and long, isn't it?
I would suck your cock until you came so good.
I'm a little deaf in this ear.
Oh, I...
I was just saying how sorry we are about your mailbox.
You have been so nice about it.
Please, it's just nothing.
It gave me something to do.
Well, we were impressed at how quickly you fixed it.
I do get up very early.
And I had some bricks and mortar laying around.
I've been doing some landscaping work in my free time.
I would feel a lot better if you let me write you a check, huh?
Absolutely not.
Accidents happen, and...
Well, if you ask me,
I built that mailbox way too close to the curb anyway.
We should get going.
We have a million things to do.
I bet you do.
Now, are you sure that we can't get you something?
Forget it.
Well, hey, how about we have you over for dinner once we're a little more settled in?
Yeah.
I would really like that.

Grandpa!
Well, come on and give him a hug.
Hi there, cutie.
Did you miss me?
Oh, great.
Ah, make yourself at home, dad.
We've been waiting for you.
"A little boy used to come on tiptoe to the window
"and watch Chip as he flew in and out of the vine, bringing worms to nip."
You sure seem to get along well with the new neighbors.
Well...
That husband is a complete waste of skin, but...
I kinda like her.
Celia.
It's a pretty name, don't you think?
I know what you're thinking, and I'd stop it right now if I were you.
What?
You know what.
We don't need any more family members.
We have enough.
Well, I agree.
But, daddy, you said grandma's gonna come soon.
Oh, she is, honey.
Mom and I are talking about something completely different.
You sound like you're jealous.
It's not that I'm attracted to her.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.
It's too close to home, Harold.
It's too risky.
I think that husband saw the bones.
You want to think he saw the bones.
You know he didn't.
I don't know how he could have missed them.
It was dark.
He was probably drunk.
You saw how bloodshot his eyes were when they came over here.
And if he did, they wouldn't have come over here to have coffee with you.
He'd have gone to the police.
All that crap about crime in L.A.
Well, L.A.'s not that bad.
It's where I met you.
You should be careful with them.
There's something brewing behind those eyes.
You know, he could be dangerous to you.
Don't worry about it.
I can take care of myself.
You're gonna do it anyway, aren't you?
Do what?
Harold!
That's enough, Jane.
- You need to really think this over.
- Drop it!
Excuse me.
Is this 11411 Lombardi Drive?
Yes, it is.
- Are you Mrs. Helen Chase?
- No.
- But this is 11411 Lombardi.
- Yes.
Well, this is the second time my office has given me the wrong address.
I'm supposed to meet Mrs. Chase here at noon to go over her insurance policy.
Sorry.
I don't know a Mrs. Chase.
Well, sorry for the bother.
- You have a nice day.
- You, too.
Uh, you need a hand with those?
No, I can manage.
Are you sure?
They look awfully heavy.
Well, if you're sure it's no bother.
No bother at all.
If you don't mind hanging onto my briefcase.
It's very light.
It's a deal.
- This way
- Okay.
Just put them down there, dear.
Thank you so much.
David?
Yeah.
Are you coming to bed?
Just about.
I'm almost done.
Well, I'm all done in the bathrooms, honey.
I'm finished.
At long last, all the toilet seats are replaced.
Come here, handsome.
I need to take shower.
That was...
It's kind of disgusting work.
Come here.
I like you dirty.
Not now, Celia.
David, please come here.
What's wrong?
I'm just...
I'm not ready for this.
Why not?
I'm not really sure I'm ready to have another child.
But you said you were.
You're the one who told me to stop taking the pill.
I know, I know.
It's just...
I don't think it's the right time.
Not yet.
David...
I need you to fully commit to this, to all of it.
You can't back out on me now.
Not now.
We've been planning this for a long time.
I know.
I just...
I need a little more time.

I'm so happy to be finally here, Harold.
Oh, I know you are, mom.
I'm going to be such a good mother to you.
Better than that lousy whore that gave birth to you ever was.
Mother!
You shouldn't talk that way.
It's not dignified.
I'm sorry, honey.
I just get so angry when I think of all she's done to you.
Sorry, mom!
Be right back.
Celia!
Oh!
Hey, I didn't think you were home.
Oh, you know.
I was down in the basement, doin' a little cleaning up.
Guess I had the music on too loud.
- I thought I heard music.
- Yeah, rockin' out.
Well, uh...
I just stopped by to see if you'd like to join us for dinner Friday night.
That would be lovely.
Harold?
Uh... great!
So, say around 7:00?
Harold!
Who's at the door?
Is that her?
Sounds perfect.
And I'll be there.
All right!
See you then.
Damn it, Jane.
Don't you ever embarrass me like that again!
Well, I wouldn't want to embarrass you in front
- of your new girlfriend...
- She's not my girlfriend.
- That would be lovely.
- Shut up.
- You're gonna get caught this time.
- Shut the fuck up!
- Hi!
- Hey, hey!
I brought you a little house-warming present.
- Great.
Come on in.
- Thank you.
Sure.
And this is our master bedroom.
Oh.
And our back yard.
Very nice.
Thanks.
Okay.
Follow me.
And this, of course, is the kitchen.
Where my wonderful husband is making one of the best spaghetti sauces you will ever taste.
Oh!
Suck-up.
And this concludes our tour.
You guys have a beautiful home.
Thank you very much.
So it's gonna be about 10 or 15 minutes before supper's ready.
Can I... interest anyone in some wine?
- Oh, sure.
Yeah.
Please.
- Okay.
Now is this the, uh, door to the basement?
Yeah.
We haven't been down there much yet.
It's... a little funky.
Mind if I check it out?
'Cause I'd like to compare it to mine.
Oh, I'm sorry.
All the lights are out, and I haven't had time to replace the bulbs yet.
You know, that reminds me.
We need to get light bulbs on our list,
- before we go to home depot tomorrow.
- Yes, commander.
- To our new neighbor.
- Well, thank you.
Cheers.
And then... she flips us off!
Only in L.A.
That's hilarious.
The only celebrity I saw, the entire time I lived there was, uh, Jay Leno in a supermarket.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is the smoke gonna bother you?
No.
No.
-Okay.
-All right.
How long did you live in L.A.?
Uh, a couple of years, roughly.
Yeah.
I followed a woman out there.
Didn't work out.
And why did you leave L.A.?
Following another woman?
No.
No.
I, uh...
I'm from here, originally.
And, uh... just seemed to make sense to me.
And, uh, how long ago did you move back?
Uh... a couple years ago.
Just a... just a... yeah, thank you.
I... really like it here.
You know?
It's... it's quiet.
And it's peaceful.
And, uh, I think it's perfect for children.
It really is.
You know, um...
That's the whole reason that we moved back here, actually.
Yeah!
So that we could have little babies.
You thinking of starting a family soon?
Yeah, actually, we already started a family.
But it, um... it got stopped.
Yeah.
We, um...
We had a child.
Uh, a daughter.
But, um, she died.
Cancer.
That's just awful.
Yep.
How 'bout dessert?
It's about time for dessert, huh?
Well, thanks, guys, for dinner.
- Had a fantastic night.
- Us, too.
All right.
Good night.
- Walk safe!
- Yeah, I'll try.
I didn't expect to see you up.
Perfect.
The great and powerful Harold has returned.
Do we really have to do this this evening?
You know we do.
So...
Did you have a good time with your little whore tonight?
Don't you dare talk about her like that.
Or what?
You couldn't live without me.
I was your first.
You were not my first.
And you know what happened to my first.
They were her bones you hid in the mailbox.
That's right.
But I was the one you started this family with.
Daddy, why are you and mommy fighting?
Because your daddy doesn't love me anymore.
- He's gonna replace me.
- Stop it, Jane.
Would you please just stop it?
He's gonna replace all of us.
All right.
That is it!
I have just about had it with you!
You're nuts!
You know that?
Absolutely fucking nuts.
Come on, honey.
And... there you go.
Into bed.
Daddy, I'm scared.
Oh, there's nothing to be scared of.
You're not gonna replace me, are you, daddy?
No.
I could never replace you.
Never in a million years.
I love you more than anything in the whole world.
I love you, too, daddy.
Oh, thank you.
All right, now it's time to go to sleep.
- Daddy?
- Yeah?
Can I have a sister?
How 'bout a big sister?
Ha ha.
All right, honey.
I'll try to get one as soon as I can.
But, now, you need to close your eyes.
It's night-night time.
I could be your daughter.
You could come into my room late at night, and...
I do a lot of drugs.
And I fuck anything that moves.
But you could save me.
I need a real father to...
Tiffany!
No one will miss me.
I hate my life.
I'd be better off with you.
Come take me.
I won't put up much of a fight.
I'll be a good big sister to Sarah.
I know what it's like to be lonely.
I probably won't even scream.
I'll be grateful.
I'll have someone to love me.
Someone to find...
Oh, no!
Are you sure you should get up?
No, no, no!
I am so sorry!
I didn't see you!
You know, it's those hedges?
Those damn hedges?
I kept telling them, trim the hedges!
Oh, my God!
Look, I have insurance.
Oh, my God.
That cut looks so bad.
Should I call an ambulance?
Yeah...
I'm gonna call it.
You need an ambulance.
- I think I'm all right.
- It's okay!
Don't worry about it...
I kept telling them to trim those fucking hedges!
It would have been beautiful.
Could you call the ambulance!
But it just wasn't meant to be.
Calling Dr. Howard.
Calling Dr. Fine.
Harold?
What are you doing here?
What happened?
Oh, uh, a car accident.
It's no big deal.
It's just a Fender-bender.
But, uh...
Well, come with me.
I'll take care of you.
I'm not quite finished filling out...
Don't... don't worry about that.
I can't let you sit out here and bleed to death.
Celia would never forgive me.
Thank you.
Well, it's a pretty nasty cut.
But it's not as bad as it looks.
It's not even gonna require stitches.
See... no signs of a concussion.
Well, you really lucked out on this one, Harold.
You know, I've always been sort of lucky that way.
Never been seriously ill, or injured.
I don't think I've ever even spent a night in a hospital.
Take it from me.
Luck like that eventually runs out.
So, uh... how are things with you and Celia?
Excuse me?
Are you getting settled in?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Since I came back to work, she's been... dealing with the house.
Well, you are the lucky one, to have a wife like her.
You don't know the half of it.
Well, there we are, Harold.
Good as new.
Well, thank you.
I'd still be out in the waiting room, if it wasn't for you.
Oh, no.
It's my pleasure.
Besides, like I said, Celia would never forgive me if I let anything happen to you.
There we go.
Celia.
Celia, wake up, baby.
I need to tell you something.
What?
What's wrong?
Well, I've been thinking, and...
I think you're right.
I'm not gonna fight it any more.
I'm ready to do it.
All of it.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
He doesn't deserve her.
It's you that can give her the family she wants.
I know.
But Jane might be right.
It's too risky, so close to home.
You shouldn't listen to Jane.
You should listen to your heart, son.
Is everything all right?
I saw a police car out here, earlier.
David's disappeared.
How long has he been gone?
Since yesterday morning.
Well, what did the police say?
They took a report, but they don't think he's missing.
They think he left me.
I mean, we have been fighting a lot lately, but...
He wouldn't do that.
He wouldn't.
Something's happened to him.
Everything's gonna be alright.
Everything's gonna be just fine.
You and I need to talk.
Mom!
I need you to watch Sarah for a while.
Okay, son.
Come with me.
I said come with me!
I've been waiting for this.
Now that you've killed David, you're gonna replace me with her.
I didn't do anything to David.
He left her.
You are such a liar.
You know I didn't do anything to David, but you can't accept that.
You can't accept that it's fate that sent David away, and that it's proof that Celia and I are meant for each other.
She'll never love you.
Yes... she... will!
Now the police still haven't found anything?
It's been a full seven days, and nothing.
Not one sign of him.
Not a clue.
'Course, I don't know how hard they're looking, seeing as they think that he's...
left me.
Well, how are you holding up?
I haven't been able to work.
I... cry myself to sleep every night.
Feel like I'm losing my mind.
Have you been out of the house at all?
I...
I'm too scared to leave.
I could miss a call from the police, from David.
Well, you need to get out of the house for awhile.
It's just not healthy for you to stay cooped up like this all the time.
I know.
But I, um...
I don't know what to do with myself any more.
I'm a wreck.
You look like you haven't had a decent meal in days.
Why don't you come over to my house for dinner tonight?
That's really sweet of you, Harold.
Um... but I...
I really should stay here.
I'm sure David wouldn't like to see you sitting around, wasting away like this.
You need a good home-cooked meal.
No, I...
I need to be here in case someone calls.
Bring your cell phone.
Oh, come on.
It'll get your mind off things.
Here's what you do.
You take yourself a nice, hot, long shower.
You get into some fresh clothes.
And come on over to my house, and let me get some food into you.
I could use a shower.
Great!
Why don't you come over around 7 o'clock.
I guarantee you won't regret it.
Okay.

Daddy, is my new mommy coming tonight?
Oh, ho!
She sure is, honey!
So... am I gonna get the full tour this time?
You certainly are.
But a little later.
After dinner.
Well, I...
I didn't realize that it was gonna be so formal.
Oh.
I guess I got a little excited about having company.
Frankly, it's been a while.
Oh... well, you look very nice.
Thank you.
Uh... do you mind if I have a smoke in here?
Uh... kinda prefer you didn't.
Well, uh... you mind if I step outside, then?
Uh... could it wait?
'Cause dinner's almost ready.
Well, I hope this is all right.
I don't get the chance to entertain that much, so...
I tend to go a little bit overboard.
No.
No.
It's very nice.
Well... allow me.
- Okay.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Some wine?
- Uh, please.
Now I want you to sit here and enjoy your wine, while I go get us the rest of our dinner.
You're very quiet this evening.
You usually ask lots of questions.
I'm sorry.
I'm not very good company tonight.
I...
I can't help but wonder where David is.
Yeah.
Let's not talk about David tonight.
I mean, there's no sense upsetting you while you're eating.
That's very bad for the digestion.
And, uh... how is everything?
Delicious.
Um...
Really, you shouldn't have gone to all this trouble.
Nonsense.
I wanted to do something nice for you.
You deserve someone who does nice things for you.
More wine?
No, thank you.
I think I've had enough.
What, are you picking tonight to get sober?
What did you just say?
That didn't come out very well.
That was a bad joke.
I...
I'm so sorry.
I'm... stuffed.
You're stuffed?
You've hardly eaten a thing.
I'm sorry.
Everything was delicious.
I...
I just don't have much of an appetite.
I don't want any more food, Harold.
I want you.
I want you, inside me.
Right now.
Right here.
On this table.
What did you say?
I said I really appreciate dinner, but, um...
- I should be going.
- No, wait!
Wait!
Uh...
We haven't even had dessert yet!
And I have a... a wonderful bottle of champagne I was just about to open.
I gotta be honest with you, Harold.
I don't feel comfortable with all of this.
I...
I'm a married woman.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't get the wrong impression now.
I wanna be your friend.
Nothing more.
Well, uh, this is coming off as romantic, not friendly.
Well, sure.
I broke out all the good stuff to impress you, not seduce you.
You've been through a very hard time, lately.
I wanted you to be able to enjoy yourself this evening.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
Of course you did.
I, um...
I'm just...
I'm a complete mess right now.
It's perfectly understandable.
You've been through an awful lot.
I... now I really should go.
Oh, no.
We can't leave it like this.
I tell you what.
We'll skip the champagne and go straight for dessert.
I bought a fantastic raspberry tort.
It would be a shame to waste it.
That sounds good.
- All right.
I'll go get it.
- No, no, no, no.
Please, finish.
Finish your dinner.
Oh, no.
If I eat any more, I won't want dessert.
Be right back.
Ah...
I don't mean to be rude, but I am going to skip dessert.
Are you sure?
Look at this.
Tempting.
But, uh, I'm really not in the mood.
What I need is a cigarette.
Okay, why don't you go out on the back porch and have your cigarette?
- You sure you don't mind?
- Yes.
No.
I'm fine.
I'll save this for later.
All right, you go ahead and have a smoke, and I shall start clearing the dishes.
Much, much better now.
Well, good.
So, how about that grand tour?
Sure.
- Are these bedrooms?
- Yes, they are.
And I'll show you those later, but first I'd like to show you my favorite room.
This is where I spend most of my time.
Do you like your new family, Celia?
You see, I can give you what David won't.
- Help!
- Come on, Celia.
- No!
- You're gonna be so happy here.
I'm gonna take such good care...
I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?
You were s-supposed to leave the back door unlocked.
I thought it'd be better to take him in here.
Hey, let me see.
Let me see.
Can you swallow?
Well, it doesn't look that bad.
Are you all right?
She's upstairs.
She's wearing the same green dress.
The same green dress.
The hell is going on here?
My husband always said I was part bloodhound.
It turns out he was right.
I tracked you down.
It took her a long time, but she finally did it.
What are you...?
You killed our daughter, you son of a bitch.
You said your daughter died from cancer.
You are a fucking cancer.
What are you gonna do?
We're gonna kill you.
But first, we're gonna make you experience every bit of pain you've ever caused.
Yeah, but someone's gonna realize I'm gone, and then two missing persons on one street?
That's gonna raise suspicion?
We never filed a missing persons report.
We called to report that someone had been lurking around in our backyard, you fucking pervert.
It's all been a set up, in case you haven't figured it out.
Hitting your mailbox was no accident.
We've been planning this for a long time.
I don't know why I was so hesitant.
You're right, it feels so good.
Yeah, it's strange, isn't it?
We were never violent people...
Until you took our daughter away from us.
I don't know about you, but I'm getting ready for bed.
Me, too.
But I don't really wanna stop.
I'm thinking about maybe starting that family of ours.
I love you, David.
I love you, too, baby.
I think I can keep him alive maybe 10 or 14 days.

Coming and going atall hours of the night.
Sarah, honey, you're sittingtoo close to the television.
I've told you.
You're gonna ruin your eyes.
You have to move back.

'Cause I can... oh, I'll eat later.
Found another kitchen boxing the bedroom.
Well, so much for labelingeverything for the movers.
I fucking hate moving!
Why are you so uptight?
I don't know.
I just... what?
What is it?
I just thought thatl would feel different now thatwe've moved here, but I don't.
I still feel unsureand...scared.
Hey, this isa new start for us,
- a new beginning.
-I know.
I just...
I can't help thinking that this might all bea huge mistake.
You're just tired.
Why don't we stop for a whileand go grab a bite to eat?
- A drink would be better.
- Okay, how about both?
Where are we?
We're almost home.
Jeez, those two glasses of winereally put you down.
Hon, I'm not usuallysuch a lightweight.
Well...the move'sbeen hard on you.

You sure were sucking backthose martinis.
Liquid courage.
It's gonna be all right.
You'll see.
You all right?
Yeah, I think so.
Are you?
Yeah.
Oh, boy.

Somebody had to haveheard that, right?
Well, whatshould we do?
- Come on.
-Wait, wait, wait.
I should getmy insurance card.
Is anyone home or...
I don't know.
Hmm.
Well, I guess I'ILJust leave a note, then.
Da--David?
Well, I left a note withour address on it.
It should be too hardto get in touch with us.
Well, I hope they'renot too upset about this.
Well, it's a hell of a wayto meet your neighbors.
That's weird.
Well, maybe the guy'sa bricklayer or something.
Well, he must have gotten the note I left'cause it's not here.
Or maybe we justdreamed the whole thing.
Uh, can I help you?
I'm David fuller.
- This ismy wife celia.
-Hi.
- Harold thompson.
-Nice to meet you.
Unfortunately, we're the ones that hit yourmailbox last night.
Would you liketo come inside?
I've got a fresh potof coffee brewing.
Sure.
And... here we are.
- I love your house.
-Thank you.
Did your wifedecorate it herself?
Uh, no.
I'm afraidl'm just an old bachelor.
But I did it all myself.
- Oh!
Impressive.
-Yeah.
If I had to decorateour place by myself, it would look likesquatters had moved in.
Cream or sugar?
Oh, I'd love somecream, thank you.
You?
Nothing for me, thanks.
So, uh, what line ofwork are you in?
I'm a type ofindependent salesman.
It's kind of hard to explain.
I guess I make huntingand fishing licenses.
Hey, that's great.
I love hunting.
Maybe you could help meget a license.
I don't actuallymake or sell the licenses.
I develop this exoticplastic film that the licensesare printed on.
It's really a specificline of work, and most peopledon't quite get it, but...
I like it.
It allows me to workout of the house--which I love.
I couldn't agree more.
I love it.
No co-workers, no bosses.
What kind of workdo you do?
Investigative reporter.
Mostly freelance work.
I swear, she is part bloodhound.
She can track downthe smallest lead.
It sounds likea fascinating job.
Actually, it's kind ofboring work, but sometimes ithas its rewards.
And what do you do?
I'm an er doctor.
You must have startedschool very young.
no
I'm older than I look, trust me.
- Are you alreadyworking here?
-Oh, no, not yet.
I'm taking a littletime off before I start overat westfall.
Westfall?
Very good hospital.
Is that what brought you twoall the way from california?
Yeah.
That anda few other things.
You must havefamily here, then.
No.
Both of our parentsdied a long time ago.
Yeah, but we figured this would bea great place to start a familyof our own.
How did you know that we came outfrom california?
- She is a reporter, right?
-Yeah.
See?
What did I tell ya?
She'll grill you, man.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's--oh-- no, no, no.
I saw your license plates.
I used to live incalifornia myself.
In the L.A. Area.
You know, I'm not really sexuallyor emotionally satisfied.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, I just said wherein L.A. Did you live?
Burbank.
Mmm!
That is crazy!
We lived right down the roading studio city!
Wow.
It is a small world.
I'll tell you, we are so glad to beout of there, though.
There's too muchcrime and traffic.
It wasn't safe anywhere.
David has a reallysmall penis.
I bet yours is big.
Nice and thickand long, isn't it?
I would suck your cock until you came so good.
I'm a little deaf in this ear.
Oh, I--I was just saying how sorry we areabout your mailbox.
You have beenso nice about it.
Please, it's just nothing.
It gave me something to do.
Well, we were impressed at how quicklyyou fixed it.
I do get up very early.
And I had some bricksand mortar laying around.
I've been doing some landscaping workin my free time.
I would feela lot better if you let mewrite you a check, huh?
Absolutely not.
Accidents happen, and... well, if you ask me,
I built that mailbox waytoo close to the curb anyway.
We should get going.
We have a millionthings to do.
I bet you do.
Now, are you sure thatwe can't get you something?
Forget it.
Well, hey, how aboutwe have you over for dinner once we're a little moresettled in?
Yeah.
I would reallylike that.
Jesus hear me praying

Grandpa!
Well, Come onand give him a hug.
Hi there, cutie.
Did you miss me?
Oh, great.
Ah, make yourselfat home, dad.
We've beenwaiting for you.
"A little boy used to come on tiptoeto the window
"and watch chip as he flew inand out of the vine, bringing worms to nip."
You sure seem to get along wellwith the new neighbors.
Well... that husband isa complete waste of skin, but I kinda like her.
Celia.
It's a pretty name, don't you think?
I know what you're thinking, and I'd stop it right nowif I were you.
What?
You know what.
We don't need any morefamily members.
We have enough.
Well, I agree.
But, daddy, you saidgrandma's gonna come soon.
Oh, she is, honey.
Mom and I are talking about somethingcompletely different.
You sound likeyou're jealous.
It's not thatl'm attracted to her.
- Yes, you are.
-No, I'm not.
It's too closeto home, harold.
It's too risky.
I think that husbandsaw the bones.
You want to thinkhe saw the bones.
You know he didn't.
I don't know how hecould have missed 'em.
It was dark.
He was probably drunk.
You saw how bloodshot his eyes were whenthey came over here.
And if they did, they wouldn't have come over hereto have coffee with you.
He'd have gone to the police.
All that crapabout crime in L.A.
Well, L.A.'Snot that bad.
It's where I met you.
You should becareful with them.
There's something brewingbehind those eyes.
He could bedangerous to you.
Don't worry about it.
I can take careof myself.
You're gonna do itanyway, aren't you?
Do what?
Harold!
That's enough, jane.
- You need to reallythink this over.
-Drop it!
Excuse me.
Is this 11411 lombardi drive?
Yes, it is.
- Are you mrs.
Helen chase?
-No.
- But this is 11411 lombardi.
-Yes.
Well, this isthe second time my office has given me the wrong address.

Chase.
Well, sorry for the bother.
- You have a nice day.
-You, too.
Uh, you needa hand with those?
No, I can manage.
Are you sure?
They look awfully heavy.
Well, if you're sureit's no bother.
No bother at all.
If you don't mind hanging onto my briefcase.
It's very light.
It's a deal.
- This way.
-Okay.
Just put themdown there, dear.
Thank you so much.
David?
Yeah.
Are you coming to bed?
Just about.
I'm almost done.
Well, I'm all donein the bathrooms, honey.
I'm finished.
At long last, all the toiletseats are replaced.
Come here, handsome.
I need to take shower.
That was-- it's kindadisgusting work.
Come here.
I like you dirty.
Not now, celia.
David, please come here.
What's wrong?
I'm just...
I'm not ready for this.
Why not?
I'm not really surel'm ready to have another child.
But you said you were.
You're the one who told meto stop taking the pill.
I know, I know.
It's just...
I don't thinkit's the right time.
Not yet.
David...
I need you to fullycommit to this, to all of it.
You can't back outon me now.
Not now.
We've been planning thisfor a long time.
I know.
I just--I needa little more time.
Wash me in the water wash me in the water wash me in the water wash me in the water
I'm so happy to befinally here, harold.
Oh, I know you are, mom.
I'm going to be sucha good mother to you.
Better than thatlousy whore that gave birthto you ever was.
Mother!
You shouldn'ttalk that way.
It's not dignified.
I'm sorry, honey.
I just get so angry when I think ofall she's done to you.
Sorry, mom!
Be right back.
Celia!
Oh!
Hey, I didn'tthink you were home.
Oh, you know.
I wasdown in the basement, doin' a little cleaning up.
Guess I had the musicon too loud.
- I thought I heard music.

That would be lovely.
Harold?
Uh-- great!
So, say around 7:00?
Harold!
Who's at the door?
Is that her?
Sounds perfect.
And I'll be there.
All right!
See you then.
Damn it, jane.
Don't you ever embarrass melike that again!
- Well, I wouldn't want to embarrass you in front... of your new girlfriend...-she's notmy girlfriend.
- That would be lovely.
-Shut up.
- You're gonna get caught this time.
-Shut the fuck up!
Hi!
Hey, hey!
I brought you a littlehouse-warming present.
- Great.
Come on in.

Just a-- just a--yeah, thank you.
I...
Really like it here.
You know?
It's-- it's quiet.
And it's peaceful.
And, uh, I thinkit's perfect for children.
It really is.
You know, um-- that's the whole reason thatwe moved back here, actually.
Yeah!
So that we couldhave little babies.
You thinking ofstarting a family soon?
Yeah, actually, wealready started a family.
But it, um--it got stopped.
Yeah.
We, um-- we had a child.
Uh, a daughter.
But, um, she died.
Cancer.
That's just awful.
Yep.

Good night.

I didn't expectto see you up.
Perfect.
The great and powerfulharold has returned.
Do we really have todo this this evening?
You know we do.
So... did you have a good time with your littlewhore tonight?
Don't you dare talkabout her like that.
Or what?
You couldn'tlive without me.
I was your first.
You were not my first.
And you know whathappened to my first.
They were her bonesyou hid in the mailbox.
That's right.
But I was the one youstarted this family with.
Daddy, why areyou and mommy fighting?
Because your daddydoesn't love me anymore.
- He's gonna replace me.
-Stop it, jane.
Would you pleasejust stop it?
He's gonna replaceall of us.
All right.
That is it!
I have just abouthad it with you!
You're nuts!
You know that?
Absolutely fucking nuts.
Come on, honey.
And...there you go.
Into bed.
Daddy, I'm scared.
Oh, there's nothingto be scared of.
You're not gonnareplace me, are you, daddy?
No.
I could neverreplace you.
Never in a million years.
I love you more thananything in the whole world.
I love you, too, daddy.
Oh, thank you.
All right, now it'stime to go to sleep.
- Daddy?
-Yeah?
Can I have a sister?
How 'bout a big sister?
Ha ha.
All right, honey.
I'll try to get one as soon as I can.
But, now, you needto close your eyes.
It's night-night time.
I could be your daughter.
You could come into myroom late at night, and--
I do a lot of drugs.
And I fuck anythingthat moves.
But you could save me.
I need a real father to--
Tiffany!
No one will miss me.
I hate my life.
I'd be better off with you.
Come take me.
I won't put up muchof a fight.
I'll be a good big sister to Sarah.
I know what it's like to be lonely.
I probably won't even scream.
I'll be grateful.
I'll have someone to love me.
Someone to find--
Oh, no!
Are you sureyou should get up?
No, no, no!
I am so sorry!
I didn't see you!
You know, it's those hedges?
Those damn hedges?
I kept telling them, trim the hedges!
Oh, my god!
Look, I have insurance.
Oh, my god.
That cut looks so bad.
Should I call an ambulance?
Yeah-
- I'm gonna call it.
You need an ambulance.
- I think I'm all right.
-It's okay!
Don't worry about it--
I kept telling them to trimthose fucking hedges!
It would havebeen beautiful.
Could youcall the ambulance!
But it justwasn't meant to be.
Calling Dr. Howard.
Calling Dr. Fine.
Harold?
What are you doing here?
What happened?
Oh, uh, a car accident.
It's no big deal.
It's just a fender-bender.
But, uh-- well, come with me.
I'll take care of ya.
I'm not quite finishedfilling out-- don't-- don't worryabout that.
I can't let you sit outhere and bleed to death.
Celia would never forgive me.
Thank you.
Well, it's a pretty nasty cut.
But it's not as badas it looks.
It's not even gonnarequire stitches.
see...no signsof a concussion.
Well, you really lucked outon this one, harold.
You know, I've always beensort of lucky that way.
Never been seriouslyill, or injured.
I don't think I've ever even spenta night in a hospital.
Take it from me:
Like thateventually runs out.
So, uh...how are thingswith you and celia?
Excuse me?
Are you gettingsettled in?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Since I came back to work, she's been...dealing with the house.
Well, you are the lucky one, to have a wife like her.
You don'tknow the half of it.
Well, there we are, harold.
Good as new.
Well, thank you.
I'd still be out in the waiting room, if it wasn't for you.
Oh, no.
It's my pleasure.
Besides, like I said, celia would never forgive me if I let anythinghappen to you.
There we go.
celia.
celia, wake up, baby.
I need totell you something.
What?
What's wrong?
Well, I've beenthinking, and...
I think you're right.
I'm not gonnafight it any more.
I'm ready to do it.
All of it.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
He doesn't deserve her.
It's you that cangive her the family she wants.
I know.
But jane might be right.
It's too risky, so close to home.
You shouldn'tlisten to jane.
You should listento your heart, son.
Is everything all right?
I saw a police carout here, earlier.
David'sdisappeared.
How long hashe been gone?
Since yesterday morning.
Well, what didthe police say?
They took a report, butthey don't think he's missing.
They think he left me.
I mean, we have beenfighting a lot lately, but--
He wouldn't do that.
He wouldn't.
******
Everything's gonnabe just fine.
******
*****
*****
*****
I've been waitingfor this.
Now that you'vekilled David, you're gonnareplace me with her.
I didn't do anythingto David.
He left her.
You aresuch a liar.
You know I didn'tdo anything to David, but you can't accept that.
You can't accept thatit's fate that sent David away, and that it's proofthat celia and I are meant for each other.
She'll never love you.
Yes...she...will!
Now the police stillhaven't found anything?
It's been a full seven days, and nothing.
Not one sign of him.
Not a clue.
'Course, I don't knowhow hard they're looking, seeing as they thinkthat he'S...
left me.
Well, how are youholding up?
I haven't been able to work.
I...cry myselfto sleep every night.
Feel like I'mlosing my mind.
Have you been outof the house at all?
I-
- I'm too scared to leave.
I could miss a callfrom the police, from David.
Well, you need to get outof the house for awhile.
It's just not healthyfor you to stay cooped up like thisall the time.
I know.
But I, um...
I don't know what to do with myself any more.
I'm a wreck.
You look like you haven'thad a decent meal in days.
Why don't you come over tomy house for dinner tonight?
That's really sweetof you, harold.
Um...but I-
- I reallyshould stay here.
I'm sure David wouldn't liketo see you sitting around, wasting away like this.
You need a goodhome-cooked meal.
No, I-
- I need to be herein case someone calls.
Bring your cell phone.
Oh, Come on.
It'll getyour mind off things.
Here's what you do.
You take yourself a nice, hot, long shower.
You get into somefresh clothes.
And Come on overto my house, and let me get somefood into you.
I could use a shower.
Great!
Why don't yacome over around 7:00.

Oh, ho!
She sure is, honey!
So...am I gonna getthe full tour this time?
You certainly are.
But a little later.
After dinner.
Well, I-
- I didn't realizethat it was gonna be so formal.
Oh.
I guess I got a littleexcited about having company.
Frankly, it's been a while.
Oh...well, you look very nice.
Thank you.
Uh...do you mind ifl have a smoke in here?
Uh...kinda preferyou didn't.
Well, uh...you mind ifl step outside, then?
Uh...could it wait?
'Cause dinner'salmost ready.
Well, I hope thisis all right.
I don't get the chanceto entertain that much, so...
I tend to goa little bit overboard.
No.
No.
It's very nice.
Well...allow me.
- okay.
Thank you-You're welcome.
- Some wine?
-Uh, please.
Now I want you to sit hereand enjoy your wine, while I go get usthe rest of our dinner.
You're very quietthis evening.
You usually asklots of questions.
I'm sorry.
I'm not verygood company tonight.
I--
I can't help butwonder where David is.
Yeah.
Let's not talkabout David tonight.
I mean, there's no sense upsetting youwhile you're eating.
That's very badfor the digestion.
And, uh-- how is everything?
Delicious.
Um... really, you shouldn't havegone to all this trouble.
Nonsense.
I wanted to dosomething nice for you.
You deserve someonewho does nice things for you.
More wine?
No, thank you.
I think I've had enough.
What, are you pickingtonight to get sober?
What did you just say?
That didn't come outvery well.
That was a bad joke.
I--
I'm so sorry.
I'm...stuffed.
You're stuffed?
You've hardly eaten a thing.
I'm sorry.
Everything was delicious.
I-
- I just don't havemuch of an appetite.
I don't want anymore food, harold.
I want you.
I want you, inside me.
Right now.
Right here.
On this table.
What did you say?
I said I really appreciatedinner, but, um...
- I should be going.
-No, wait!
Wait!
Uh-- we haven't evenhad dessert yet!
And I have a-- a wonderfulbottle of champagne I was just about to open.
I gotta be honestwith you, harold.
I don't feel comfortablewith all of this.
I-
- I'm a married woman.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't get the wrongimpression now.
I wanna be your friend.
Nothing more.
Well, uh, this is coming off asromantic, not friendly.
Well, sure.
I broke outall the good stuff to impress you, not seduce you.
You've been througha very hard time, lately.
I wanted you to be ableto enjoy yourself this evening.
I'm-
- I'm sorry.
Of course you did.
I, um-
- I'm just--
I'm a complete messright now.
It's perfectlyunderstandable.
You've been throughan awful lot.
I-- now I reallyshould go.
Oh, no.
We can't leaveit like this.
I tell you what.
We'll skip the champagneand go straight for dessert.
I bought a fantasticraspberry tort.
It would be a shameto waste it.
That sounds good.
- All right.
I'll go get it.
-No, no, no, no.
Please, finish.
Finish your dinner.
Oh, no.
If I eat any more, I won't want dessert.
Be right back.
Ah...
I don'tmean to be rude, but I am goingto skip dessert.
Are you sure?
Look at this.
Tempting.
But, uh, I'm reallynot in the mood.
What I need isa cigarette.
Okay, why don't yougo out on the back porch and have your cigarette?
- You sure you don't mind?
-Yes.
No.
I'm fine.
I'll save this for later.
All right, you go aheadand have a smoke, and I shall startclearing the dishes.
Much, much better now.
Well, good.
So, how aboutthat grand tour?
Sure.
- Are these bedrooms?
-Yes, they are.
And I'llshow you those later, but first I'd like toshow you my favorite room.
This is wherel spend most of my time.
Do you likeyour new family, celia?
You see, I cangive you what David won't.
- Help!
-Come on, celia.
- No!
-You're gonna beso happy here.
I'm gonna takesuch good ca--
I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?
You weres-supposed to leave the back door unlocked.
I thought it'd be betterto take him in here.
Hey, let me see.
Let me see.
Can you swallow?
Well, it doesn'tlook that bad.
Are you all right?
She's upstairs.
She's wearingthe same green dress.
The same green dress.
The hellis going on here?
My husband always saidl was part bloodhound.
It turns out he was right.
I tracked you down.
It took her a long time, but she finally did it.
What are you--
you killed our daughter, you son of a bitch.
You said your daughterdied from cancer.
You are a fucking cancer.
What are you gonna do?
We're gonna kill you.
But first, we're gonnamake you experience every bit of painyou've ever caused.
Yeah, but someone'sgonna realize I'm gone, and then two missing personson one street?
That's gonnaraise suspicion?
We never fileda missing persons report.
We calledto report that someone had been lurking... around in our backyard, you fucking pervert.
It's all been a set up, in case you haven'tfigured it out.
Hitting your mailboxwas no accident.
We've been planning thisfor a long time.
I don't knowwhy I was so hesitant.
You're right, it feels so good.
Yeah, it's strange, isn't it?
We were neverviolent people... until you took our daughteraway from us.
I don't know about you, but I'm gettingready for bed.
Me, too.
But I don'treally wanna stop.
I'm thinking about maybe startingthat family of ours.
I love you, David.
I love you, too, baby.
I think I can keep him alivemaybe 10 or 14 days.
I know his blood hath made me whole
I know his blood hath made me whole if I touched the hem of his garment
I know his blood hath made me whole well, I know his blood done made me whole well, you know his blood has made me whole well, if I touched the hem of his garment well, you know his blood

Masters. of.
Horror
Season 2 Episode 2 202 Family
You're a fatty fatty fatty...
What's your son doing?
Apparently, he's doing the "fatty" dance.
Inappropriate?
Well, maybe, but I'm raising my son to be a straight shooter.
- That's his mom right over there.
- Oh, thanks for including me.
Dr Cox and Jordan weren't the only ones with kid troubles.
My brand-new girlfriend was pregnant, and we were trying to decide what to do.
- Should we keep it or get rid of it?
- I don't know.
If we keep it, it'll just end up in the dumpster.
Okay, enough pizza talk.
I mean, we're clearly stalling here.
- You're right.
- So let's go.
Do you like kids?
Of course I do.
What about you?
Any nieces or nephews?
Yeah, I have a nephew, although he's 45.
But occasionally, I do have to change his diaper.
- He was kicked by a horse.
- Oh, no.
Yeah.
Now, how do you feel about adoption?
So, beautiful, I hope you keep some ice in this locket 'cause you're making me hot all over.
Actually, it's the only picture I have of my biological father.
- Do you want to see it?
- What?
Oh, sure.
I'll take a look at it first thing tomorrow morning, huh?
Yeah, I'm not a big fan of adoption.
- You think if it's a girl you'd doink her?
- I know I will.
Yup.
All right.
Well, look, we don't need to make this decision tonight, right?
- I mean, plenty of time...
- I'm totally fine with stalling.
Great, because if I hear the word "baby" one more time,
I'm gonna lose it!
Dude, Carla's in labour!
Meet me at the apartment!
Go, go, go!
- Is he coming?
Is he coming?
- Turk, she's barely in labour.
Oh, he's not talking about the baby.
He's here, and now we can have our baby!
Okay, Brown Bear, commence Operation Brown Cub.
- Suitcase.
- Check.
- Stylish big daddy hat.
- Check.
- Big-time collegiate drum line.
- Check.
I want the whole world to know my baby's having a baby!
Maybe we should just take your car.
Okay, ladies, we're here.
Calm down.
What the hell took you so long?
Oh, my God.
Did you stop for food?
We had to, honey.
J.D. promised the band that we'd feed them.
Yeah, let me get 23 cheeseburgers, 23 milkshakes...
Miguel, if you don't stop drumming, you're not getting fries.
Twenty-three...
You know what?
Twenty-two fries.
Twenty-two fries.
You didn't think I'd do it, did you?
Miguel has such raw talent, but his attitude keeps getting in the way.
Yay, congratulations, whoopee.
All right, see you.
We are so happy for you.
He's so sweet.
You put one of those inside me.
What are we going to do?
Turk, you brought my suitcase, right?
Of course I have your suitcase, honey.
What are you doing?
Sometimes, when you need a miracle, you have to pray extra, extra hard.
- You wanna help me out?
- Fo' shizzle.
Please, Lord...
Nothing.
Baby, changed my mind.
- I don't have your suitcase.
- Turk, what the hell?
It's okay, it's okay, Carla, because I packed you an extra overnight bag, and you're all checked in and I got you an orderly to take you to your room.
Yeah, I'm only four months pregnant, ace.
Yeah, I think you're looking for me.
Move it along before I eat you!
Chop-chop!
Sorry, Jack, the machine's broken.
Looks like you're gonna have to guzzle your juice down without any ice.
- Pretend...
You know, pretend it's gin.
- What's gin?
Gin is an alcoholic beverage, which, if your mommy's strong genes are any indication, you'll eventually learn to love as it slowly destroys a giant portion of your adult life.
First the fat lady, now this?
He's three, Perry.
Do you have to be so blunt with him?
I'm not gonna BS my own kid.
What's the big deal?
Hiya, sport!
- Your skin is wrinkly.
- Yeah?
Well, that shirt you're wearing is gay.
Hey, baby, I know things haven't exactly gone smoothly so far, but I promise you I'm about to make it up to you.
I spent all weekend talking to my cousin, who just so happens to be the world's biggest blerd.
That's a black nerd.
Anyway, he taught me everything about streaming video and now, thanks to me, your sisters in Chicago will be able to witness the birth of our child live via webcam.
- Turk, that's so sweet.
- You know, I do what I do.
All we gotta do is wait for the cameraman to get here.
"Cameraman"?
No man's gonna be filming my pooter unless he's completely asexual.
- Hello!
- Oh, hey, Ted.
Cool.
All right, I'm gonna go tell your sisters that this bad boy is about to pop off.
All right, Carla, let's check how dilated you are.
Looking real good, Carla.
Okay, we're live in three, two, one...
Okay, looks like you're at about three centimetres.
Greatest show ever.
And record.
Cool, Swamp Thing.
What's that, Daddy?
Oh, that's the vagina of a 35-year-old Latina woman.
Baby?
What the...
J.D., we have to talk about all of our pregnancy options, even if they make us uncomfortable.
There's one way of dealing with this that no one's mentioned yet.
- The "A" word.
- I know.
- Abortion.
- Appletinis.
What?
I thought that we could discuss abortion over Appletinis.
Did somebody just say "abortion"?
Laverne, with all due respect, this is none of your business or Jesus'.
I believe he would beg to differ.
She's right, J.D. Every life is precious.
But what if having this baby is a huge mistake for us?
Okay, I'm gonna make this real simple.
No abortions, okay?
- But what if...
- No abortions.
Let me finish.
What if the parents were, like, abusive drug-addicts who would neglect their kid?
Oh, well, in that case, it'd be okay.
- Really?
- No abortions!
How are you not getting this?
This sucks.
I mean, the hardest decision I've had to make in the last year was what hairstyle to get, and even then all I did was open up an Us Magazine, close my eyes and pick a random celebrity.
- Kirsten Dunst?
- Owen Wilson.
Yeah.
You know what's making this so hard?
This relationship is so new, we can't tell if we have a chance of making this work long-term.
You know what might give us an inkling?
We haven't technically had sex yet.
That might help us find out if we're on the same page, you know,
- in the boudoir.
- Are you hitting on me?
- I'm sorry.
I'm being an idiot, aren't I?
- No.
Clothes off, we're doing it.
Yeah!
All right, we are definitely sexually compatible.
I'm putting that down in the pro "let's have a baby" category.
That's exactly what we should do.
We should make a list of pros and cons.
What did you two just do?
Because I sure don't see any wedding rings!
Laverne, is this your Jesus?
Turk, I got your shift covered so you could hang here.
Oh, and Carla, there's something I wanted to tell you.
Great vagina.
- So helpful!
- Don't take it out on The Todd.
He was just giving me a compliment.
- Thank you, Todd.
- Hey, happy to say it.
So, what's next, Turk?
Because so far I'm half-deaf from a drum line,
I have no suitcase, and the entire hospital has seen
Ms Priscilla.
I named her after my high school art teacher.
Oh, my God, so did I!
Mr Hebler. "It's nice to meet you. "
Okay, let me just read the last of the cons.
We're not married, we're both totally focused on our careers, babies are known to be sticky, and the average cost of raising a child is $400,000.
Okay.
Here are the final pros.
Kids are great, we both make good money, your boobs will get huge,
I can finally buy Beanie Babies without feeling weird, and kids are great...
- Which you already said.
... tax deductions.
- Oh, yeah, awesome.
- Oh, nice one.
- All right, so then what's the final tally?
- Nice.
Let's see.
That's 20 cons and 19 pros.
- I guess we gotta abort.
- Yup.
Wait, I'm sorry.
That's an eyelash, I made a wish.
- It's a tie.
Abortion's off.
- Okay.
So now what?
Every couple has its share of problems.
Congrats, Perry.
My son just asked me if my vagina had ever been on television.
And did you tell him not since the late '80s when you were trying to make it as an "actress"?
Whether it's someone digging in...
Will you just cut the crap and stop treating your son like he's your drinking buddy?
Jordan, I'm not going to change who I am, all right?
End of story.
Jackie.
Or someone's stealing your thunder...
Okay, candles are all lit, lavender-scented, your favourite.
And here's a picture of your mom to watch over you.
And then I got this kit in case you want to bronze the umbilical cord and use it as a key chain.
I practised at home on some calamari.
Elliot, you're amazing.
Well, is there anything I can do to help?
Elliot's got everything covered.
Still, nothing's worse than facing the biggest decision of your life and not getting anywhere.
Don't you wish it was this easy?
Heads yes, tails no.
You don't see that every day.
You know what?
We're getting nowhere.
Let's split up for an hour and do some soul-searching.
- Where are you going?
- I was just gonna walk around.
Why, where do you go when you soul-search?
All right, Justin, what should my speciality be?
Oncology or radiology?
I go someplace wonderful.
Anyway, I was thinking we need new table linens for the dining room.
Well, not so much table linens as place mats.
What do you think's prettier, burgundy or mauve?
- What the hell's with her?
- She's mad, but she can't give me the silent treatment because she knows I'd actually love that.
So she's giving me talk-until-I-want-to- commit-suicide treatment.
- Sucks to be you.
- You have no idea.
What else do I need for that?
Oh, I need new pillow shams and I like cotton, but I think we should get a cotton blend because that's easier to clean and I hate ironing.
Maybe we need a new housekeeper.
Maybe the housekeeper should come every single day now.
Look, Elliot, I'm really trying to be involved in the birth of my child, but you just keep boxing me out.
That is not true.
Now, out of my way,
I've gotta order the birth announcements, put in the car seat and find a yard to bury the placenta...
Oh, my God, I'm a monster.
Turk, I am so sorry.
- I just love babies so much.
- It's true.
Sometimes she makes me wear a diaper.
Keith, private!
- So, what is Elliot's plan?
- Oh, it's really simple.
See, when Carla says, "I'm thirsty,"
Elliot'll say, "Oh, no, I forgot the ice chips. "
That's when I walk in, ice in hand, and I say, "Christopher Turk, at your cervix. "
Should I have a baby, too?
You know, I'm a little preoccupied right now.
- Why don't you ask your unicorn?
- This is way over Justin's head.
He's never even been in love.
Not real love, anyway.
What's up with the ice?
I don't know what to do.
I mean, having a baby can completely ruin your life, you know?
Not to mention, as a urologist,
I have seen what childbirth can do to you down there.
I mean, I examined this one woman last month and it was like, "Hello, hello, hello... "
Not a good time, Kim.
- Oh, God, I'm thirsty.
- Really?
Unfortunately, I forgot the ice chips.
Ice chips!
- Dude, help.
I'm totally stuck.
- Why don't you just yank it out?
I would not do that.
That's how it happened!
Ice chips, ice chips, ice-ice chips-chips!
Hey, guys.
Carla, let me just see how far you can reach here.
Okay, perfect.
Turk would like you to call him because he's stuck in an ice machine.
What?
See, that's why I took the precaution.
Kim, would you be a sweetie and give Turk a call for me?
Yes, ma'am.
Hey, baby, look, I...
Yeah, he's right here.
- Hold on.
She won't talk to me.
- Hi.
Yes, I know, he missed your wedding, too.
All right, hold on.
- That was from her, not me.
- Go.
Relax, I'll have him out in one second.
All right, now hold still.
Nobody likes a jagged stump.
No!
He's being unreasonable.
Okay.
That was from me.
- Hey, there.
- Hey.
So, have you decided what you want to do?
You know what?
Neither one of us should have to go first.
How about, on the count of three, we both say what we think we should do?
- Okay.
- One, two, three...
- I got nothing.
- Appletinis.
So, you guys gonna keep it?
- There's a lot to...
- Maybe, but if we do, we can...
- Because...
- Then we can...
- Probably.
- Maybe not.
You know, I had an abortion.
All right, Jackie.
As promised, let's go find ourselves a little stethoscope so you can hear what your butt sounds like.
- Daddy, what's an abortion?
- Enjoy.
My mommy had an abortion!
My mommy had an abortion!
My mommy had an abortion!
- My mommy had an abortion.
- How you doing?
Okay, Janitor, Carla's starting to push.
Tell Turk.
Got it.
Your baby has a tail.
I told her to stay away from the microwave.
- Elliot, I can't do it!
- Okay, okay, I want you to imagine that your uterus is like a tube of toothpaste and you're just trying to squeeze out all that minty-fresh gel, but instead of minty-fresh gel inside, there's a little black baby.
We have a prolapsed umbilical cord.
She needs a C-section, right now.
- Put Turk on the phone, damn it!
- It's okay.
Baby, listen.
I'm not angry that you got stuck.
I know you were just trying to be nice because you're a good-hearted, wonderful, thoughtful man, but listen to me.
They're giving me a C-section, and I'm really scared and I need you to be here right now.
Something about a C-section.
Smile.
- Almost there?
- Almost there.
- Baby!
I'm here!
- Turk, I'm scared!
- Sorry, Dr Turk, no ice machines.
- No!
I was 19 and working in Nantucket as a waitress and dating this amazing guy named Andy.
Curly blond hair and dimples and eyes that were either sky blue, powder blue,
I could never figure out which.
Anyway, his best friend, Curt, knocked me up.
Don't look at me like that.
That was the first guy
- I had ever slept with.
- Oh, we're not judging you.
Whore!
I think about it from time to time, but it would have been the biggest mistake to have that baby.
We've talked, we've made lists, and we've been as logical as we can here, and we've still got nothing.
It's not a logical decision.
If it's right, you'll feel it in your heart.
Yeah, but what if we don't feel anything?
Maybe that's your answer.
Carla's having a C-section.
Jordan, you okay?
- My mommy had an abortion.
- She sure did, sweetie.
How are my boys?
What's going on?
- They're about to start.
- Turkleton!
If you are trying to get the same $5 million settlement that damn hook-handed security guard got, you're out of luck, stud, 'cause I put a release button right here on top.
Well, what are you waiting for, son?
Get in there.
- How you doing, beautiful?
- Turk, you're here.
I'm so hot.
Don't sweat it.
I got you.
Guys, I have an announcement.
Miguel, please!
The baby's out, but the cord was wrapped around its neck, so we had to take it to the NICU.
They say you never realise your capacity to love until you have a child.
It can change who you are.
Where do babies come from?
Where do babies come from?
Well...
When a mommy and a daddy love each other very, very much, sometimes they close their eyes and they make a wish.
It can fill you with joy.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to Isabella Turk.
I'm a daddy!
I'm a daddy!
It can even give your heart the answer you thought you'd never find.
Let's do this.
You're a fatty fatty fatty...
What's your son doing?
Apparently, he's doing the "fatty" dance.
Inappropriate?
Well, maybe, but I'm raising my son to be a straight shooter.
- That's his mom right over there.
- Oh, thanks for including me.
Dr Cox and Jordan weren't the only ones with kid troubles.
My brand-new girlfriend was pregnant, and we were trying to decide what to do.
- Should we keep it or get rid of it?
- I don't know.
If we keep it, it'll just end up in the dumpster.
Okay, enough pizza talk.
I mean, we're clearly stalling here.
- You're right.
- So let's go.
Do you like kids?
Of course I do.
What about you?
Any nieces or nephews?
Yeah, I have a nephew, although he's 45.
But occasionally, I do have to change his diaper.
- He was kicked by a horse.
- Oh, no.
Yeah.
Now, how do you feel about adoption?
So, beautiful, I hope you keep some ice in this locket 'cause you're making me hot all over.
Actually, it's the only picture I have of my biological father.
- Do you want to see it?
- What?
Oh, sure.
I'll take a look at it first thing tomorrow morning, huh?
Yeah, I'm not a big fan of adoption.
- You think if it's a girl you'd doink her?
- I know I will.
Yup.
All right.
Well, look, we don't need to make this decision tonight, right?
- I mean, plenty of time...
- I'm totally fine with stalling.
Great, because if I hear the word "baby" one more time,
I'm gonna lose it!
Dude, Carla's in labour!
Meet me at the apartment!
Go, go, go!
- Is he coming?
Is he coming?
- Turk, she's barely in labour.
Oh, he's not talking about the baby.
He's here, and now we can have our baby!
Okay, Brown Bear, commence Operation Brown Cub.
- Suitcase.
- Check.
- Stylish big daddy hat.
- Check.
- Big-time collegiate drum line.
- Check.
I want the whole world to know my baby's having a baby!
Maybe we should just take your car.
Okay, ladies, we're here.
Calm down.
What the hell took you so long?
Oh, my God.
Did you stop for food?
We had to, honey.
J.D. promised the band that we'd feed them.
Yeah, let me get 23 cheeseburgers, 23 milkshakes...
Miguel, if you don't stop drumming, you're not getting fries.
Twenty-three...
You know what?
Twenty-two fries.
Twenty-two fries.
You didn't think I'd do it, did you?
Miguel has such raw talent, but his attitude keeps getting in the way.
Yay, congratulations, whoopee.
All right, see you.
We are so happy for you.
He's so sweet.
You put one of those inside me.
What are we going to do?
Turk, you brought my suitcase, right?
Of course I have your suitcase, honey.
What are you doing?
Sometimes, when you need a miracle, you have to pray extra, extra hard.
- You wanna help me out?
- Fo' shizzle.
Please, Lord...
Nothing.
Baby, changed my mind.
- I don't have your suitcase.
- Turk, what the hell?
It's okay, it's okay, Carla, because I packed you an extra overnight bag, and you're all checked in and I got you an orderly to take you to your room.
Yeah, I'm only four months pregnant, ace.
Yeah, I think you're looking for me.
Move it along before I eat you!
Chop-chop!
Sorry, Jack, the machine's broken.
Looks like you're gonna have to guzzle your juice down without any ice.
- Pretend...
You know, pretend it's gin.
- What's gin?
Gin is an alcoholic beverage, which, if your mommy's strong genes are any indication, you'll eventually learn to love as it slowly destroys a giant portion of your adult life.
First the fat lady, now this?
He's three, Perry.
Do you have to be so blunt with him?
I'm not gonna BS my own kid.
What's the big deal?
Hiya, sport!
- Your skin is wrinkly.
- Yeah?
Well, that shirt you're wearing is gay.
Hey, baby, I know things haven't exactly gone smoothly so far, but I promise you I'm about to make it up to you.
I spent all weekend talking to my cousin, who just so happens to be the world's biggest blerd.
That's a black nerd.
Anyway, he taught me everything about streaming video and now, thanks to me, your sisters in Chicago will be able to witness the birth of our child live via webcam.
- Turk, that's so sweet.
- You know, I do what I do.
All we gotta do is wait for the cameraman to get here.
"Cameraman"?
No man's gonna be filming my pooter unless he's completely asexual.
- Hello!
- Oh, hey, Ted.
Cool.
All right, I'm gonna go tell your sisters that this bad boy is about to pop off.
All right, Carla, let's check how dilated you are.
Looking real good, Carla.
Okay, we're live in three, two, one...
Okay, looks like you're at about three centimetres.
Greatest show ever.
And record.
Cool, Swamp Thing.
What's that, Daddy?
Oh, that's the vagina of a 35-year-old Latina woman.
Baby?
What the...
J.D., we have to talk about all of our pregnancy options, even if they make us uncomfortable.
There's one way of dealing with this that no one's mentioned yet.
- The "A" word.
- I know.
- Abortion.
- Appletinis.
What?
I thought that we could discuss abortion over Appletinis.
Did somebody just say "abortion"?
Laverne, with all due respect, this is none of your business or Jesus'.
I believe he would beg to differ.
She's right, J.D. Every life is precious.
But what if having this baby is a huge mistake for us?
Okay, I'm gonna make this real simple.
No abortions, okay?
- But what if...
- No abortions.
Let me finish.
What if the parents were, like, abusive drug-addicts who would neglect their kid?
Oh, well, in that case, it'd be okay.
- Really?
- No abortions!
How are you not getting this?
This sucks.
I mean, the hardest decision I've had to make in the last year was what hairstyle to get, and even then all I did was open up an Us Magazine, close my eyes and pick a random celebrity.
- Kirsten Dunst?
- Owen Wilson.
Yeah.
You know what's making this so hard?
This relationship is so new, we can't tell if we have a chance of making this work long-term.
You know what might give us an inkling?
We haven't technically had sex yet.
That might help us find out if we're on the same page, you know,
- in the boudoir.
- Are you hitting on me?
- I'm sorry.
I'm being an idiot, aren't I?
- No.
Clothes off, we're doing it.
Yeah!
All right, we are definitely sexually compatible.
I'm putting that down in the pro "let's have a baby" category.
That's exactly what we should do.
We should make a list of pros and cons.
What did you two just do?
Because I sure don't see any wedding rings!
Laverne, is this your Jesus?
Turk, I got your shift covered so you could hang here.
Oh, and Carla, there's something I wanted to tell you.
Great vagina.
- So helpful!
- Don't take it out on The Todd.
He was just giving me a compliment.
- Thank you, Todd.
- Hey, happy to say it.
So, what's next, Turk?
Because so far I'm half-deaf from a drum line,
I have no suitcase, and the entire hospital has seen
Ms Priscilla.
I named her after my high school art teacher.
Oh, my God, so did I!
Mr Hebler. "It's nice to meet you. "
Okay, let me just read the last of the cons.
We're not married, we're both totally focused on our careers, babies are known to be sticky, and the average cost of raising a child is $400,000.
Okay.
Here are the final pros.
Kids are great, we both make good money, your boobs will get huge,
I can finally buy Beanie Babies without feeling weird, and kids are great...
- Which you already said.
... tax deductions.
- Oh, yeah, awesome.
- Oh, nice one.
- All right, so then what's the final tally?
- Nice.
Let's see.
That's 20 cons and 19 pros.
- I guess we gotta abort.
- Yup.
Wait, I'm sorry.
That's an eyelash, I made a wish.
- It's a tie.
Abortion's off.
- Okay.
So now what?
Every couple has its share of problems.
Congrats, Perry.
My son just asked me if my vagina had ever been on television.
And did you tell him not since the late '80s when you were trying to make it as an "actress"?
Whether it's someone digging in...
Will you just cut the crap and stop treating your son like he's your drinking buddy?
Jordan, I'm not going to change who I am, all right?
End of story.
Jackie.
Or someone's stealing your thunder...
Okay, candles are all lit, lavender-scented, your favourite.
And here's a picture of your mom to watch over you.
And then I got this kit in case you want to bronze the umbilical cord and use it as a key chain.
I practised at home on some calamari.
Elliot, you're amazing.
Well, is there anything I can do to help?
Elliot's got everything covered.
Still, nothing's worse than facing the biggest decision of your life and not getting anywhere.
Don't you wish it was this easy?
Heads yes, tails no.
You don't see that every day.
You know what?
We're getting nowhere.
Let's split up for an hour and do some soul-searching.
- Where are you going?
- I was just gonna walk around.
Why, where do you go when you soul-search?
All right, Justin, what should my speciality be?
Oncology or radiology?
I go someplace wonderful.
Anyway, I was thinking we need new table linens for the dining room.
Well, not so much table linens as place mats.
What do you think's prettier, burgundy or mauve?
- What the hell's with her?
- She's mad, but she can't give me the silent treatment because she knows I'd actually love that.
So she's giving me talk-until-I-want-to- commit-suicide treatment.
- Sucks to be you.
- You have no idea.
What else do I need for that?
Oh, I need new pillow shams and I like cotton, but I think we should get a cotton blend because that's easier to clean and I hate ironing.
Maybe we need a new housekeeper.
Maybe the housekeeper should come every single day now.
Look, Elliot, I'm really trying to be involved in the birth of my child, but you just keep boxing me out.
That is not true.
Now, out of my way,
I've gotta order the birth announcements, put in the car seat and find a yard to bury the placenta...
Oh, my God, I'm a monster.
Turk, I am so sorry.
- I just love babies so much.
- It's true.
Sometimes she makes me wear a diaper.
Keith, private!
- So, what is Elliot's plan?
- Oh, it's really simple.
See, when Carla says, "I'm thirsty,"
Elliot'll say, "Oh, no, I forgot the ice chips. "
That's when I walk in, ice in hand, and I say, "Christopher Turk, at your cervix. "
Should I have a baby, too?
You know, I'm a little preoccupied right now.
- Why don't you ask your unicorn?
- This is way over Justin's head.
He's never even been in love.
Not real love, anyway.
What's up with the ice?
I don't know what to do.
I mean, having a baby can completely ruin your life, you know?
Not to mention, as a urologist,
I have seen what childbirth can do to you down there.
I mean, I examined this one woman last month and it was like, "Hello, hello, hello... "
Not a good time, Kim.
- Oh, God, I'm thirsty.
- Really?
Unfortunately, I forgot the ice chips.
Ice chips!
- Dude, help.
I'm totally stuck.
- Why don't you just yank it out?
I would not do that.
That's how it happened!
Ice chips, ice chips, ice-ice chips-chips!
Hey, guys.
Carla, let me just see how far you can reach here.
Okay, perfect.
Turk would like you to call him because he's stuck in an ice machine.
What?
See, that's why I took the precaution.
Kim, would you be a sweetie and give Turk a call for me?
Yes, ma'am.
Hey, baby, look, I...
Yeah, he's right here.
- Hold on.
She won't talk to me.
- Hi.
Yes, I know, he missed your wedding, too.
All right, hold on.
- That was from her, not me.
- Go.
Relax, I'll have him out in one second.
All right, now hold still.
Nobody likes a jagged stump.
No!
He's being unreasonable.
Okay.
That was from me.
- Hey, there.
- Hey.
So, have you decided what you want to do?
You know what?
Neither one of us should have to go first.
How about, on the count of three, we both say what we think we should do?
- Okay.
- One, two, three...
- I got nothing.
- Appletinis.
So, you guys gonna keep it?
- There's a lot to...
- Maybe, but if we do, we can...
- Because...
- Then we can...
- Probably.
- Maybe not.
You know, I had an abortion.
All right, Jackie.
As promised, let's go find ourselves a little stethoscope so you can hear what your butt sounds like.
- Daddy, what's an abortion?
- Enjoy.
My mommy had an abortion!
My mommy had an abortion!
My mommy had an abortion!

- Put Turk on the phone, damn it!
- It's okay.
Baby, listen.
I'm not angry that you got stuck.
I know you were just trying to be nice because you're a good-hearted, wonderful, thoughtful man, but listen to me.
They're giving me a C-section, and I'm really scared and I need you to be here right now.
Something about a C-section.
Smile.
- Almost there?
- Almost there.

I'm here!

Scrubs- episode 6x02
High-Five Team
'Kay, ladies, we're here; calm down.
What the hell took you so long?
Oh, my God, did you stop for food?
We had to, honey.
J.D. promised the band that we'd feed them.
Yeah, let me get twenty-three cheeseburgers, twenty-three milkshakes
Miguel, if you don't stop drumming, you're not getting fries.
Twenty-three fri...
You know what, twenty-two fries.
Twenty-two fries...you didn't think I'd do it, did you.
Miguel has such raw talent, but his attitude keeps getting in the way.
Yay, congratulations, whoopee, all right, see ya.
We are so happy for you!
He's so sweet!
You put one of those inside me!
What are we gonna do?
Turk, you brought my suitcase, right?
Of course I have your suitcase, honey.
What are you doing?
Sometimes when you need a miracle, you have to pray extra-extra hard.
You wanna help me out?
Fo' shizzle.
Nothing!
Okay.
Baby!
Changed my mind.
Don't have your suitcase.
Turk!
What the hell?
It's okay.
It's okay, Carla, because I...
packed you an extra overnight bag, you're all checked in, and I got you an orderly to take you to your room.
Yeah, I'm only four months pregnant, ace.
Oh, yeah, I think you're looking for me.
Move it along before I eat you!

Looking real good, Carla.
Okay, we're live in three, two, one....
Okay.
Looks like you're at about three centimeters.
Greatest show ever!
And...record.
Cool!
Swamp thing!
What's that, daddy?
Oh, that's the vagina of a 35-year-old Latina woman.
Baby?
What the!
?

J.D., we have to talk about all of our pregnancy options, even if they make us uncomfortable.
There's one way of dealing with this that no one's mention yet....
The A-word.
I know....
- Appletinis
-Abortions.
What?
I thought that we could discuss abortion over appletinis.
Did somebody just say "abortion"?
Laverne, with all due respect, this is none of your business.
Or Jesus's.
I believe He would beg to differ.
She's right, J.D. Every life is precious.
But what if having this baby is a huge mistake for us?
Okay,
I'm gonna make this real simple:
No abortions, okay?
But what if...
No abortions!
Lemme finish!
What if the parents were like abusive drug addicts who would neglect their kids?
Oh, well, in that case it'd be okay.
Really?
NO ABORTIONS!
How are you not getting this!
?
This sucks.
I mean, the hardest decision I've had to make in the last year was what hairstyle to get.
And even then, all I did was open up an US Magazine, close my eyes and pick a random celebrity.
Kirsten Dunst?
Owen Wilson.
You know what's making this so hard?
This relationship is so new, we can't tell if we have a chance of making this work long-term.
You know what might give us an inkling?
We haven't technically had sex yet.
That might help us find out if we're on the same page... you know...in the boudoir.
Are you hitting on me?
I'm sorry, I'm being an idiot, aren't I.
Nope.
Clothes off.
We're doing it.
...Yeah!
All right, we are definitely sexually compatible.
I'm putting that down in the pro "let's have a baby" category.
That's--that's exactly what we should do, we should make a list of pros and cons.
What did you two just do?
Because I sure don't see any wedding rings!
Laverne?
Is this your Jesus?
Turk, I got your shift covered so you could hang here.
Oh, and Carla, there's something I wanted to tell you...
Great vagina!
So helpful!
Don't take it out on The Todd!
He was just giving me a compliment!
Thank you, Todd.
Hey, happy to say it.
So what's next, Turk?
Because so far, I'm half deaf from a drum-line,
I have no suitcase, and the entire hospital has seen Miss Priscilla!
I named her after my high school art teacher.
Oh, my God!
So did I!
Mr. Hebbler.
"It's nice to meet you!"
Okay, let me just read the last of the cons:
We're not married, we're both totally focused on our careers, babies are known to be sticky, and the average cost of raising a child is four-hundred-thousand dollars.
Okay.
Here are the final pros:
Kids are great... we both make good money, your boobs'll get huge
I can finally buy Beanie Babies without feeling weird, and kids are great!
Which we already said.
Tax deductions!
All right, so then what's the final tally?
Nice.
Let's see, that's twenty cons and nineteen pros.
I guess we gotta abort.
Yep.
Wait, I'm sorry.
That's an eyelash, I made a wish.
It's a tie...abortion's off.
Okay, so now what?
Every couple has its share of problems.
My son just asked me if my vagina had ever been on television.
-And did you tell him not since the late 'eighties when you were trying to make it as "an actress"?
Whether it's someone digging in...
Will you just cut the crap and stop treating your son like he's your drinking buddy?
Look, I'm not going to change who I am, all right?
End o' story.
Jacky.
...or someone stealing your thunder.
Okay, candles are all lit... lavender scented, your favorite.
And here's a picture of your mom to watch over you.
And then I've got this kit in case you want to bronze the umbilical cord and use it for a keychain.
I practiced at home on some calamari.
Elliot, you're amazing.
We...hey, is there anything I can do to help?
Elliot's got everything covered.
Still, nothing's worse than facing the biggest decision of your life and not getting anywhere.
Don't you wish it was this easy.
Head's yes, tail's no.
You don't see that every day.
You know what?
We're getting nowhere.
Let's split up for an hour and do some soul-searching.
Where're you going?
Oh, I was just gonna walk around.
Why?
Where do you go when you soul-search?
All right, Justin.
What should my specialty be, oncology or radiology?
I go someplace wonderful.
Anyway, I was thinking we need new table linens for the dining room.
Well, not so much table linens as placemats.
What do think's prettier, burgundy or mauve?
What the hell's with her?
She's mad.
But she can't give me the silent treatment because she knows I'd actually love that, so she's giving me the talk-until-I-want-to-commit-suicide treatment.
Sucks to be you.
You have no idea.
...What else do I need for that?
Oh, I need new pillow shams.
And I--I like cotton, but I think we should get a cotton blend because that's easier to clean, and I hate ironing.
Maybe we need a new housekeeper.
Maybe the housekeeper should come every single day now.
Look, Elliot, I'm really trying to be involved in the birth of my child, but you just keep boxing me out.
That is not true.
Now, outta my way,
I've gotta order the birth announcements, put in the carseat, and find a yard to bury the placenta.
Oh, my God, I'm a monster!
Turk, I am so sorry.
I just love babies so much.
It's true.
Sometimes she makes me wear a diaper.
Keith!
Private!
So what is Elliot's plan?
Ah, it's really simple:
See, when Carla says "I'm thirsty,"
Elliot'll say, "Oh no, I forgot the ice chips."
That's when I walk in, ice in hand, and I say, "Christopher Turk, at your cervix!"
Ahh!
Should I have a baby, too?
You know, I'm a little preoccupied right now.
Why don't you ask your unicorn?
Ah, this is way over Justin's head.
He's never been in love.
Not real love, anyway.
What's up with the ice?
I don't know what to do.
I mean, having a baby can completely ruin your life, you know?
Not to mention, as a urologist,
I have seen what childbirth can do to you down there.
I mean, I examined this one woman last month and it was like
"Hello...hello...hello...hello..."
Not a good time, Kim!
Oh, God, I'm thirsty!
Really?
Unfortunately...
I forgot the ice chips.
ICE CHIPS!
Dude, help!
I'm totally stuck!
Why don't you just yank it out?
I would not do that.
That's how it happened!
Ice chips!
Ice chips!
Ice ice!
Chips chips!
Hey, guys.
Carla, let me just see how far you can reach here.
Okay, perfect.
Turk would like you to call him because he's stuck in an ice machine.
What?
!
?
!
See, that's why I took the precaution.
Heh.
Kim, would you be a sweetie and give Turk a call for me?
Yes, ma'am.
Hey, baby, look, I...
Yeah, he..he's right here.
She won't talk to me.
Hi.
Yes, I know he missed your wedding, too.
All right, hold on.
That was from her, not me.
Go.
Relax, I'll have him out in one second.
All right, hold still nobody likes a jagged stump.
NOOO!
He's being unreasonable.
Okay.
That was from me.
you decided what you wanna do?
You know what, neither one of us should have to go first.
How about, on the count of three, we both say what we think we should do.
Okay.
One, two, three.
- I got nothing.
- Appletinis.
So, you guys gonna keep it?
- Um, maybe...we--well, if we do--we can--then we...maybe not.
- Um, we don't--prob--well, there's a lot to con--because--we'll probably
- ...maybe not.
- ...maybe not.
You know, I had an abortion.
All right, Jacky, as promised, let's go find ourselves a li'l stethoscope so you can hear what your butt sounds like.
Daddy, what's an abortion?
Enjoy.
My mommy had an abortion.
My mommy had an abortion....
How you doin'?
Okay, Janitor, Carla's starting to push, tell Turk.
Got it.
Your baby has a tail.
I told her to stay away from the microwave.
Ahhh!
Elliot, I can't do it!
I want you to imagine that your uterus is like a tube of toothpaste, and you're just trying to squeeze out all that minty fresh gel.
But instead of minty fresh gel inside, there's a little black baby.
We have a prolapsed umbilical cord.
She needs a C-section right now.
Put Turk on the phone, dammit!
Baby!
Listen.
I'm not angry that you got stuck,
I know you were just trying to be nice, because you're a good-hearted, wonderful, thoughtful man.
But listen to me:
They're giving me a C-section, and I'm really scared.
And I need you to be here right now!
Something about a C-section.
Smile!
Almost there.
Almost there.
Baby!
I'm here!
Turk!
I'm scared!
Sorry, Dr. Turk.
No ice machines.
Noo!
I was nineteen and working on Nantucket as a waitress, and dating this amazing guy named Andy..
with curly blond hair and dimples and eyes that were either sky blue...powder blue.
I could never figure out which...
Anyway, his best friend, Curt, knocked me up.
Don't look at me like that.
That was the first guy I had ever slept with.
Oh, we're not judging you.
whore!
I think about it from time to time, but it would have been the biggest mistake to have that baby.
We've talked, we've made lists, and we've been as logical as we can here, and we've still got nothin'.
It's not a logical decision.
If it's right, you'll feel it in your heart.
Yeah, but what if we don't feel anything?
Maybe that's your answer.
Carla's having a C-section.
Jordan, you...you okay?
My mommy had an abortion.
She sure did, sweetie.
How are my boys?
What's going on?
They're about to start
Turkleton!
If you are trying to get the same five million dollar settlement that damn hook-handed security guard got, you're outta luck, stud.
Because I put a little release button right here on top.
Well, what are you waiting for, son?
Get in there.
How you doin', beautiful?
Turk, you're here...!
I'm so hot....
Oh, don't sweat it.
I got ya.
Guys.
I have an announcement.
Miguel, please!
The baby's out, but the cord was wrapped around its neck, so...we had to take it to the NICU.
They say you never realize your capacity to love until you have a child.
It can change who you are...
Where do babies come from?
"Where do babies come from?
When a mommy and a daddy love each other very, very much, sometimes they close their eyes... and they make a wish.
...they can fill you with joy...
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to introduce you to Isabella Turk.
I'm a daddy.
I'm a daddy!
...it can even give your heart the answer you thought you'd never find.
Let's do this.

The best spaceship ever would fly out in space.
It would have fins like a shark... and a clown for a face.
Its wings have propellers... its sails catch the breeze.
It runs on marshmallows, and its wheels are skis.
The pilot is brave, he drinks like my dad.
He rarely takes showers, and yells when he's mad.
Billy, what the hell is wrong with this damn thing?
The steering wheel is a frickin' pretzel, damn it!
Holy shit!
Then it plunges straight into the sun... and that bastard is never heard from again.
What?

Billy, I'm breaking up.
Oh, my God, it's a sauna in here.

Dear God, I'm sorry for everything I've ever...

We live in a world of information.
Cyberspace is choc-a-block with the stuff.
Half of it is accurate, but boring.
The other half is just plain wrong and useless.
But one per cent of it is of great value.
And one per cent of that one per cent is lethal.
ALL:
Cheers!
To Jo.
It's horrible.
Happy birthday, Jo.
Just what I wanted.
I got a pony for my 21st.
She's already got a pony.
I was a sneak thief.
I hacked into the Pentagon,
The Ministry of Defence,
City of London, and other places.
And I had a good look at their dirty underwear.
I tell you, it's not a good way to make friends.
I wouldn't blame them for wanting me dead.
Yes.
Yes, I've seen it.
Well, I suppose one should be grateful that the apostrophe's in the right place.
Of course...
I have taken remedial action.
Have you picked your first victim yet?
How long a list do you want?
I'm speaking to ex-criminal turned best-selling author, Nicky Turnbull.
Mr Turnbull.
Nicky.
Sorry.
Nicky.
On the cover of your paperback, you're called "the first of the rock'n'roll hackers." Would you like to elaborate?
We live in a world of information.
Cyberspace is choc-a-block with the stuff.
Tosser.
Hi, pet, it's your dad.
I got your message.
Um...
I'll try again this evening.
Let's try and have a conversation one of these young days, or one of these weeks.
Love you.
Morning, sir.
Governor wants a word.
It's all right, I've scrubbed my fingernails.
Does the name Nicky Turnbull mean anything to you?
Celebrity criminal.
I happened to catch him on the radio on the way in.
Any conclusions?
I wasn't really paying much attention.
He's been getting death threats.
His agent telephoned.
Could we keep an eye on him while he's in Oxford?
Baby-sitting?
I'm not utterly convinced about these death threats, but, on the other hand, I made a discreet call to Whitehall.
Mr Turnbull's not without enemies.
I don't suppose you've read his book?
No, it passed me by.
Just out in paperback.
"The astonishing story of how a boy from the wrong side of the tracks on Tyneside uncovered the deadliest secrets of MI5 and the Pentagon."
The first "rock'n'roll hacker".
Ah!
You were paying attention.
Well, that bit sort of sunk in.
He also stole a few million quid from various corporate piggy banks - including a couple of Oxford colleges ending up in prison where he learned to be a writer and found redemption.
Warms your heart, doesn't it?
I can think of better ways to warm my heart.
He's from your part of the world, so you can talk about whippets, and leeks, and Alan Shearer.
Is that his name?
Yeah, that's his name.
But he's retired now.
There's the book, and there's a copy of his Oxford itinerary.
Try and keep him alive till four o'clock tomorrow.
And maybe check whether he's really retired.
Noted.
I remember this place when it was a prison.
I suppose it's a compliment to our clean-up rate that it isn't needed any more.
Yeah, that must be it.
Finished that already?
I sort of speed-read it.
I see.
Any good?
It's exploiting the public's fascination with crime and criminals.
Are we being exploited?
I wonder if this police protection is just a publicity stunt.
I wouldn't bet against it, sir.
What is it about people that wear dark glasses even when the sun isn't shining?
Wow!
A formidable police presence, eh?
Your agent says you've had death threats.
We've been ordered to give you protection.
I could have done with yous two when I was in prison.
The old lags give you a hard time?
It's all in the book.
Don't suppose you've read it yet, but...
No, I've read it.
Oh, he's a good lad, your sergeant.
I know.
I haven't read your book, so you'll need to tell me who might like to kill you.
I certainly upset people in the Pentagon.
And in Whitehall, I caused one or two early retirements on full pension.
Then I took a few million from er...
a couple of chaps in the City of London.
They do it to each other all the time, like, but they don't like it when it's a lad like me.
"Robin Hood of the '90s.
I stole from the rich and I kept it for myself."
That's very good.
I'm quoting your book.
As I said, very good.
Why would any of these people want to kill you now?
This was all years ago.
You say you've retired.
Or is it just publicity for your paperback?
Probably the publication of the paperback has reminded them that I know where some of the bodies are buried.
Hotel security, James.
So, do you get back home much?
Every night.
Unless there's a major incident.
No, I mean up North.
Last proper visit, 15 years ago.
My Uncle Harry's funeral.
Don't you miss it?
If I did, I'd go up more often.
Howay man!
You can take the lad out of Tyneside, you canna take Tyneside out of the lad.
Sorry, I've never been much of a professional Northerner.
Thank you very much, Mr Webster.
Enjoy your stay.
I shall make resolute efforts so to do.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
How can I help you, sir?
I was wondering if you could tell me about hotel security.
Security?
As in people coming in and going out.
I see evidence of CCTV.
Yes.
I suppose...
that's the security.
Covering what?
The main entrance and the exit to the car park?
Well... ..yes.
Does it run 24 hours?
I expect so.
I go off at five.
Handing over to...?
His name's Paul.
He's a proper hotel person.
I'm only part-time.
OK.
Well, thanks, Chloe.
Oh, what are you reading?
PPE.
Politics, Philosophy, Economics.
Good luck.
Have a nice life.
Hi.
Mr Turnbull?
Nicky.
Nicky.
We are your reception committee.
Caroline Morton, reading English and Union President.
David Harvey, Union Secretary.
I wrote the grovelling invitation.
Which I dictated, because I do long words and I schmooze well.
Jo Gilchrist, student journalist.
I'm a rugby player.
I mainly do muscle.
Aye.
Didn't I see you playing for England?
You were there?
No, on the box, like.
You saw the Aussie who jumped on my leg and knackered my knee.
I haven't played since.
But we help him with his therapy.
I bet you do.
Stephen Gilchrist, Jo's brother.
I'm not on any committees.
I just like to hang around for the free suppers, try to keep my sister out of trouble.
Totally without success.
Now there's a surprise.
But we let Stephen do the money.
He'll be dealing with your expenses.
Well, that's easy, there aren't any.
The cheque'll be in the post tomorrow.
(CHUCKLES) Right.
I'm an old family friend from Tyneside, just passing through.
Shall we sit down and relax?
Anybody object to champagne?
Could we have a bottle of champagne and five glasses?
How do you want to organise this, sir?
Well, for a start, it's not a two-man job.
In fact, I don't think it's a proper job at all.
Afternoon shift or evening shift?
Take your pick.
Afternoon.
I'm doing something this evening, but I can change it if you've got plans.
I very rarely have plans.
Oh, he signed your book.
Oh, I shall no doubt treasure it.
"To Tom, my favourite copper"?
Tom?
Tom.
James.
Not even close, are they?
Look how he's spelt favourite.
The O and the U the wrong way round.
He's supposed to be a writer.
They've got computer spelling machines to do that for you nowadays.
Keep an eye on me, Tom.
I might end up killing the bugger myself.
Cheers.
Cheers.
See you later.
Aye!
Gan canny!
Who is he?
Special Branch?
I could tell you, but er...
I'd have to shoot you.
We've got a present for you.
Good.
I love presents.
My newspaper.
Jo wants to be a tabloid editor when she grows up.
I've told her she can't do both, but she ignores me.
So who's Sam?
An eminent professor of English literature.
But Sam isn't his real name.
And he's got a scam?
Examination cheating, computer-assisted.
Sounds good.
And next week we hang him out to dry.
We're also hoping you might give us an in-depth interview while you're here.
We?
Caroline and I work together on these assignments.
Well, you might find my depths a bit shallow, but if you don't mind taking the chance...
We all believe in taking chances.
He's everything I hate.
Everything?
Celebrity criminal and professional Geordie.
That's only two things.
It's enough to keep me going.
Our speaker tonight is described by his publishers as
"the first of the rock'n'roll hackers".
His book bears the mouth-watering promise, "soon to be a major feature film".
And I know many would-be Oscar winners in this room would like to follow in those footsteps, preferably without the intervening prison sentence.
So... we will be listening with more than usual interest to...
..Nicky Turnbull!
Thank you, bonny lass.
If you'd told me when I was a little lad growing up in Byker that one day I'd be speaking to the Oxford Union, I'd have said, "Don't be daft, man."
And Caroline's right.
Stay out of prison.
The food's terrible.
Room service was lousy, and it's full of Chelsea supporters.
I escaped by writing a book.
Let me tell you about it.
We live in an age of information.
Cyberspace is choc-a-block with the stuff.
Half of it is accurate, but boring.
The other half, just plain wrong and useless.
Just one per cent is of great value.
And one per cent of that one per cent is lethal.
That's where the gold's hidden.
And that's where I went prospecting with my little pick and shovel.
Well, my dad's a coal miner, so...
I was just keeping up the family tradition, like.
Were you really brought up in Byker?
No.
I was born in Jesmond.
But you know how it is.
Humble beginnings go down a treat in places like this.
Like being a miner's son?
Why aye.
They love all that crap.
Well, I did have an Auntie Beryl in Byker.
Everybody had an Auntie Beryl in Byker.
Hey, look out!
Are you all right?
Aye, I'm all right.
Thanks, bonny lad.
Are you all right?
Aye, aye, aye.
Don't worry, pet.
Worse things happen in prison.
Try sharing a cell with a serial killer.
I think you should go home now.
I'm under orders to protect you.
Bollocks, man.
Somebody just tried to run you down!
Some little boy passed his driving test, celebrating with his first half of shandy?
Nah, I'm safely gathered in, man.
You call in to headquarters, tell them I'm standing you down.
I'll take full responsibility.
Besides, I think I'm on a promise.
Maybe two.
OK.
First thing in the morning.
Try second.
Come on, now, girls.
Housekeeping!
Oh!
I'm sorry.
Miss?
Yeah, Lewis.
What?
Any identification?
OK.
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Hello, pet.
Yeah, listen, can I call you back?
Yeah.
Somebody's just found a body.
A girl about your age, apparently.
Yeah, I hate my job sometimes.
But I love you and I'll definitely get back, OK?
Bye-bye, love.
Doors closing.
In there?
Jo Gilchrist.
Yeah.
She said she dictated the invitation for Turnbull to come and talk at the Union.
He gets death threats and...she ends up dead.
What's that revolver doing there?
My daughter would say this is seriously weird.
Dr Hobson?
On her way.
Were all these other rooms occupied?
That'll be my next job, I suppose.
With special reference to room 123.
I'll start my house-to-house.
Oh.
Hi.
Hi.
You're Nicky's old friend from Tyneside.
And you're Caroline Morton.
You're the Union President.
What's happening?
I'm here in my official capacity.
Er...
Sorry.
Don't understand.
What capacity are you here in?
I er...spent the night with Nicky.
What, in there?
Yes.
Look, I've got a ten o'clock tutorial.
We may need to speak to you again later.
Where do you normally live?
I'm at Penville.
Good.
Excuse me.
Morning.
Morning.
Where is it?
Where's what?
These are all the people booked in last night?
Yes.
The names in red have already checked out.
And this one in blue?
Room 123?
It was booked, but the guy didn't show up.
It says here his name's Lewis.
Yes.
A copper, apparently.
Stephen, it's Caroline.
Call me.
Strangled.
With?
I can't be certain, but it could be bare hands.
Time of death?
Best guess...
between two or three in the morning.
Right.
Any joy?
Not sure joy is the word.
Explain.
The room was booked in your name.
Some people are playing games.
My money's on the Central Committee.
Start with the brother, Stephen Gilchrist.
We'll need him to identify the body.
At the very least.
I'm gonna call on Turnbull while the sheets are still warm.
Canny room, yes?
Very pleasant.
My favourite word in the language.
Upgrade.
Cup of instant with added non-dairy whitener?
I'll give it a miss.
Mm-hm.
You're very early.
Early?
Aye.
I know you're my officially-designated bodyguard... ..but the next gig's not till eleven o'clock.
Book signing.
I'm not here in my bodyguard capacity.
Are you not?
Is it something I said?
What time did you come to bed?
About two o'clock.
Any witnesses?
Aye.
Caroline Morton.
President of the Oxford Union.
Was she with you all night?
Unless she sneaked out while I was asleep.
Oh, you did sleep?
Quite a lot of the time, actually.
Stamina's not what it was.
Did Caroline sleep?
You'd have to ask her.
Could you have sneaked out while she was asleep?
Hang on a minute.
This is alibi talk.
I'd know it anywhere.
What's it all about?
It's about a dead body in the next room, Mr Turnbull.
The young woman whose body was found upstairs was a non-resident.
I realise that.
What's the hotel's policy?
I'm not sure what you mean.
On residents taking non-residents upstairs for, if you'll forgive the expression, a quick screw.
It's a bit of a grey area.
Describe the colour grey to me in this context.
Well, last night, for example.
20 or 30 students pile into the bar with that writer guy.
He's resident, and he's buying champagne all around cos he's celebrating some million-dollar film deal.
Now, I can't guarantee if some non-resident didn't slip through the net.
OK, so if I, as a non-resident, wanted to get into room 123, what would I need?
You'd need a pass key.
Which always lives in your pocket.
There are a couple in the drawer behind the desk.
Anyone who'd worked here would know where to look.
And a lot of students have worked here.
Stephen Gilchrist?
Caroline Morton?
David Harvey?
Any of them worked here?
They don't have to.
They've got rich daddies.
Is it true?
Is it Jo?
We'll need your help.
Would you go with Sergeant Hathaway?
You want me to identify the...?
I could come with you.
No, you stay here.
But be around for later.
Sure.
Mike.
He's good, isn't he?
I know.
Scary in one so young.
You'll call me when you've got any answers?
Of course.
Is there really nothing I can do?
Just stay in Oxford.
Of course.
It's where I live.
The team are asking the obvious questions.
What time did they go to bed last night?
Did they see anything, hear anything, murder anyone?
And who booked the room in your name?
Yeah, that too.
Also, what does anybody know about this gun?
It wasn't loaded and, as far as we can see, it hasn't been fired.
So is it just the latest design accessory?
Also, we need to know the names of all the students in the bar last night drinking Nicky Turnbull's champagne.
I'll be back on the case as soon as I've finished baby-sitting.
Yes, that's Jo.
She didn't deserve this.
Nobody does.
Er...
I think my bike's at the hotel.
Let's go and get it.
You'd never met Jo Gilchrist before yesterday?
No.
You were with me at the time.
But it was her idea that you should come to Oxford.
So she said, like.
I mean, probably committees and democracy and stuff, but all I know is, they wrote to my agent and said would I like to speak at the Oxford Union?
Well, it looks good on the CV.
So, we said, "Throw in a book signing and you're in business."
So your agent fixed everything?
Aye, she winds me up and sets me going.
Did she book me a hotel room?
It only seemed right.
You know...
round-the-clock protection.
She thought you might need somewhere to rest your weary head.
Round-the-clock protection means staying awake.
Circumstances change.
Yeah, like beautiful, young Union presidents.
Howay man, it's only rock'n'roll.
All right.
Thanks.
There you go, bonny lad.
Hello.
Hi.
Who's it for?
It's not for me, it's for my son.
Mm-hm?
Does he have a name?
He's called Darren.
Darren?
He's in computers.
Well, it's better than being in prison.
And I've tried both.
Why did you do that?
If it wasn't for him, Jo would still be alive!
You'll have to explain that.
I'm sorry, I can't.
There you go.
Give us a moment.
Sure.
Don't go away now.
Done this sort of stuff before?
Aye, many, many times.
How much longer have we got to go?
For this lot, I'd say er...20 minutes.
So, if you fancy a pint or something to eat...
Bodyguards don't eat.
But I would like to keep an eye on the day job.
I'll just be outside.
Watch out for students bearing bicycles.
Now, then, bonny lass, what can I do for you?
Anything making sense yet?
The CCTV footage shows us that there were lots of students in the hotel last night, some of them drunk.
Oh, and I've clarified the link between Turnbull and the fine city of Oxford.
Go on, make my day.
Two of the colleges, Trevelyan and St Jude's.
Turnbull hacked into their investment portfolios and relieved them of a lot of money.
What's this got to do with Jo Gilchrist?
Absolutely nothing.
So I nicked a few quid off a couple of colleges.
Became an Oxford University stakeholder.
Howay man, they should take better care of their money.
Nobody got hurt.
I mean, look around you.
Are the walls tumbling down?
Robin Hood strikes again, huh?
Exactly.
How come all these pretty young women, 20-year-olds, want to leap into bed with...
What, with a middle-aged fart like me?
You wouldn't say that to Mick Jagger.
You're not Mick Jagger!
True.
I'm strictly B-list.
And not a word to the missus, mind, but... ..you'd be surprised how many women fall for the old lovable rogue routine.
And there's no lack of enthusiasm on her part.
On the other hand...
What?
It might have been a honey trap, a stitch-up for afters.
They were into all that stuff.
What's this all about?
Some professor they were going to hang out to dry, so they said.
Maybe I was next up for a public hanging.
You didn't mind?
To be honest, I was half expecting a three-in-a-bed sex romp.
You'd have to be a real killjoy to object to that.
Obviously, there'd be questions in the house when I go home, but trust me...
love rats sell a lot of books.
Well, I appreciate your honesty.
So, tell me the truth about these death threats, before the honesty wears off.
All right.
Well, my agent did have a couple of anonymous emails.
But it was pathetic stuff, really.
You know, from the sort of sad bastards who probably use green ink and have name tags in their underpants.
We thought, to hell with it, the paperback's just out, make it official, get a bit of publicity.
"Nicky defies death threats." You read that in the paper.
We have eyes everywhere.
Trouble is, bullshit works.
It sells tickets for the circus, man.
But yes, it's a guilty plea.
Publicity stunt.
Wasting police time.
I'll throw myself at the mercy of the court.
I'll make the front pages tomorrow, bonny lad.
The bullet went straight into the heart.
Death would have been pretty instant.
Highly professional?
Yeah.
Sure it came from up there?
Well, either from the hotel roof or the council buildings next door.
Grassy knoll or the book depository?
What?
Well, we'll check everything.
Yeah, well don't forget the stuff in his hotel room.
We're gonna need to go snooping in his laptop.
Watch out for green ink.
Green ink?
How's the baby-sitter?
Yeah, looks like I failed.
I didn't come to say I told you so, I need to know you're all right.
Thank you, I'm fine.
Tell me what happened.
Well, that's the strange thing about it.
He'd just owned up to the fact that the whole death-threat thing was a scam, a publicity stunt, when bang!
Then it all went quiet, and I realised... ..I realised that I was safe, and he was the one they were after.
I'm taking various items from Mr Turnbull's room.
There's the list.
Is that allowed?
Civil liberties, and so on.
I'm not sure civil liberties are uppermost in the late Mr Turnbull's mind at the moment.
The story so far.
Jo Gilchrist, aged 21.
Third-year student.
Found dead early this morning at the hotel.
Apparently strangled.
Although there's bruising indicating she might have been bumped on the head first.
She'd drunk a little champagne, maybe a couple of glasses.
But no trace of drugs, no sign of recent sexual activity.
Nicky Turnbull.
Reformed criminal, best-selling author.
Shot and killed at 2:10 this afternoon.
Outside the hotel.
A single bullet wound.
More details once Ballistics have er... done their homework.
Where are we on identification of his body?
Well, his agent's coming up from London this afternoon.
Sir, his wife.
Oh, I thought it was his agent.
Well, they're one and the same person.
It's all on the laptop.
Is there anything else on the laptop?
Not yet.
He's quite eccentric with his access codes, but we'll get there.
Moving on.
Possible links between the two victims.
Jo Gilchrist, a key member of the committee that invited Turnbull up to speak to the Union.
Turnbull spent the night with Caroline Morton, the Union President.
But he actually told me that he thought it might be a...honey trap, with a view to selling the story to the tabloids.
Jo Gilchrist was very much into exposing people in print.
She apparently also had her sights set on an Oxford don.
We need to identify him, find out what he was up to, if anything, and whether it relates to the killings.
Jo Gilchrist also has a brother, Stephen.
He's currently roaming the streets of Oxford throwing bicycles through shop windows.
He isn't.
No?
He's downstairs.
He's come here to confess.
Confess to what?
He didn't say.
All right, there'll be a press conference at five.
Probably a bromide statement.
"We're keenly pursuing several lines of inquiry", et cetera.
Appeals to the public.
The usual bag of tricks.
Including the grieving widow if she's here in time?
Well, I actually hate all that stuff, but er...
I'll be guided by the grieving widow.
We're told you want to confess.
Yes.
Confess to what, precisely?
You know, you were there.
The stupid business with the bicycle.
Is that all?
What else is there?
I ran away, but I panicked and didn't know what else to do.
I couldn't think straight.
I was...
All right, all right.
Relax.
Deep breaths.
Tell him about the bicycle.
You can be charged with criminal damage in the fullness of time, but we know this is your first offence.
We're not overly worried about the shop window.
I see.
Who is Sam?
Sam?
I'm told your sister was about to, quote, "Hang him out to dry"?
He...er...he's an eminent professor of English Literature.
His name's Weller, hence the Sam.
Sam Weller, Pickwick Papers.
I know.
I did it for O-Level.
Which I failed, to save you checking.
So, was your sister planning to do the same sort of thing with Turnbull?
A honey trap and then public exposure?
It could have been that.
So why do you blame Turnbull for Jo's death?
I just know if he hadn't come to Oxford she'd still be alive.
I'm...
I'm sure that Jo and Caroline were planning something, but I don't know what.
They didn't tell me their secrets.
But you're her brother.
The thing is, there's really two kinds of student here at Oxford.
There's the dedicated scholars and the chancers.
And you are?
I'm a scholar.
I'd be happy to spend my life writing books that only 37 people in the world want to read.
And Jo?
Was ambitious.
I mean, you know what Shelley said.
Remind me.
That poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.
Jo said that Shelley was wrong.
These days it's the er...
newspaper editors.
So she wanted to rule the world?
I suppose.
And what about her close friends?
She didn't have any.
You, Caroline Morton, David Harvey.
People like Jo hang out with whoever they think can be useful to them.
They get together when their agendas overlap, but don't confuse it with friendship.
They're all too competitive to have friends.
Hathaway.
Two minutes.
You go.
Tell me about the gun.
The gun?
Your sister was found with a revolver.
It was a birthday present.
From?
David Harvey.
The rugby player.
It wasn't his idea.
She said she'd like a gun for her birthday.
Where did he get it from?
No idea.
Maybe from one of his rugby mates.
Some of them have military tendencies.
Was she frightened something might happen to her?
No, she was never frightened of anything.
The gun was just something to show off with.
It was a design accessory.
She only wanted one because nobody else had a gun.
She was my sister, and because she was my sister I loved her.
But I didn't really like her very much.
It's a short walk.
Is my driver OK here?
Yeah, he'll be fine.
You can't blame me, can you?
I'm sorry?
For falling in love with him.
Thank you.
Tell me about this press conference, then.
It'll be a short statement by DI Lewis, the officer in charge of the investigation, followed by some questions and probably very few answers.
Because you don't know any?
Because it's very early on in the investigation.
Right, well, I'm at your service.
Well, I never!
What?
A long time ago, Sergeant, when the world was very, very young,
Mrs Turnbull and I went to school together.
Aye, not only that.
He was my first boyfriend.
We're dealing with two murders within a 12-hour period.
It goes without saying that the police would like to hear from any member of the public who saw anything unusual or suspicious in the area of the hotel, either last night or this morning.
I'll be taking some questions later, but first, Mrs Turnbull wishes to make a short statement.
Thank you.
Um...
First, I'd like to add my support to that appeal.
If you can help, please do so.
As I look around, I see one or two familiar faces from the tabloid press.
I have no doubt that over the days ahead we'll be reading many stories about my late husband.
I could help you write them.
The tale of a reformed criminal who, even when he was going straight, was still a bit of a rogue, a bit of a lad.
Yes...he was.
He liked a drink, and he liked a pretty face.
So he may have been a bit of a lad...
..but he was my bit of a lad.
Mrs Turnbull isn't taking questions.
I'll have a couple, but as long as they're short.
Do the police think there is a connection between the murders?
Yes.
The officer in charge.
Mr Turnbull was apparently killed by a sniper.
We know he had enemies in Whitehall and the Pentagon.
Will you be looking for a link to the security services?
We'll be looking for a link to somebody that can shoot a rifle with great accuracy.
You were with Turnbull at the time.
Is it possible you were the real target?
No more questions.
Thank you all.
That was fine.
Thank you.
Good.
Mr Lewis.
Yeah.
Er...
Excuse me.
We know that was mostly bullshit, but if anything juicy comes along, I get first whack, don't I?
Before the hooligans from Wapping?
Oh, definitely.
In fact, you could do me a favour, Norman.
What?
Apparently, Turnbull filched a lot of money from a couple of the colleges,
Trevelyan and St Jude's, during the '90s.
Were there any repercussions?
Nothing public.
Conspiracy of silence.
Oxford has to be seen to be immune from that sort of thing.
Leave it with me.
Thanks, Norman, you're a star.
Sorry about that.
So, what are the plans now?
What a question.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's all right.
Well, I was planning to overnight here with Nicky for a spot of R and R, you know, but...
Would it help if I stayed around?
Assist with inquiries.
Is that the phrase?
Well, it would, if you feel you're up to it.
Yeah.
Let's talk, eh?
It's supposed to help, isn't it?
The talking cure.
That's what Sigmund Freud said.
I'm...
I'm suddenly hungry.
Is that awful?
It's a normal symptom of shock.
We'll find somewhere quiet to feed you, have a talk.
Just give us five minutes to make a phone call.
Aye.
Where is the wisdom we've lost in information?
What?
TS Eliot.
Don't know the fella.
Listen, I want you to talk to Caroline Morton and David Harvey.
In either order.
Ask them about honey traps and guns.
Was Jo gonna shoot Turnbull?
If so, why?
What was she gonna use for bullets?
We'll save Professor Weller for tomorrow morning.
And you'll be?
Friends Reunited.
Hello.
I'd like to see Caroline Morton.
I'm sorry, but she says she's not talking to any journalists.
I'm too nice to be a journalist.
Oh.
Sorry, sir.
She's in her room.
But I think she's with somebody.
Lucky her.
I'd like to see Caroline Morton.
I'm sure you would, but you damn well can't.
I think I damn well can.
Just this once.
You've been raided by the police.
How thrilling.
I'll call you later.
I hope they're being generous with their pieces of silver.
You must know the golden rule of whoring.
Give good value and insist on the going rate.
When did you first meet him?
In prison, eight or nine years ago.
What were you doing in prison?
I used to go in twice a week, would you believe, to do drama therapy.
You'll have to explain.
The theory is it helps the guys with their problems by acting them out.
I was a liberal-minded do-gooder.
Did you do any good?
Yeah.
Yes, I did, as a matter of fact.
No need to sound apologetic.
I know what people like you think of do-gooders.
What makes you think I'm a people like me?
OK, we'll assume you're an exception.
Either way, prison officers are worse.
Villains are villains, and no arty-farty bollocks will change it.
I can imagine.
Anyway, Nicky, he was in my drama group.
One of the things I had them do was tell us stories, and he told very good stories.
Mind, I'm not sure they were all strictly true, but...
Well, anyway, I encouraged him to write them down.
When he came out, we put them in the book, and the rest you know.
Where did marriage fit in all this?
Chronologically, it went... ..drama teacher, editor...
..lover, agent, wife.
Would you like to see the wine list?
Oh, ta.
I'm driving, I'll just have water, but...
Would it be terrible of me?
Why, no.
It'll be our secret.
What were you and Jo Gilchrist up to last night?
Obviously you were going to stitch up Nicky Turnbull, but what was the game plan?
A three-in-a-bed sex romp?
I'm told that goes down well in the tabloids.
We were going to sort of...
play it by ear.
But she never turned up.
Obviously.
Was she going to bring her gun with her?
Just as a theatrical prop.
She hadn't got any bullets.
We were gonna play that by ear, as well.
Scare him shitless and see what happened.
So what did you do?
Basically, we had sex and went to sleep.
Next morning, your friend's dead in the next room.
I didn't know that, did I?
And we weren't exactly friends.
Jo and I were... ..useful to each other.
Useful?
That's what Oxford is for.
Get to know the right people, it'll stand you in good stead the rest of your life.
Like being Union President is the first step to being prime minister?
Place your bets now.
All that being so,
Jo Gilchrist had no friends?
I guess not.
Mummy and Daddy love her?
Mum's an alcoholic and Dad's living in Dubai with the au pair.
Happy families, then.
There's a lot of them about.
Will there be anything else?
Yeah.
Tell me where I can find David Harvey.
Pumping iron.
Thank you.
Last night in the bar at the hotel, your husband was buying champagne all round.
Nicky loved showing off.
Apparently, he was celebrating some film deal.
Yeah, we'd sold the film rights to the Americans.
I assume that's good.
The money's amazing.
They'll screw up the story, of course.
Set it in Los Angeles,
Starring a pretty 20-year-old who gets the girl and finds God, but... that's the business.
Tell me about the business.
You're an agent, so you take a percentage of what your clients earn?
Yeah.
How many clients?
Hm...
About half a dozen.
All different kinds of writers?
No, all much the same.
I thought that was the whole point about artists, that they were all different.
Like with music.
Mozart sounds like Mozart and Beethoven sounds like Beethoven.
I'm sorry, pet, this isn't about art, this is about the marketplace.
Do you know the biggest growth area in publishing?
Books on slimming?
No.
True crime.
So your clients are all ex-cons?
Well, a couple are back inside, but...yeah.
Nicky was the first.
He attracted a lot of attention and we had old lags queuing round the block with their stories.
"I was a drug baron, a gangland enforcer, a safe-breaker, until I saw the light."
All different but the same.
Murderers?
Hit men?
Inevitably.
He told me that he'd made some enemies before he went into prison, and then some more while he was inside.
Then maybe even more once he'd gone straight.
You met him.
He was a chancer.
But yes, prison would be a good place to start.
David Harvey?
Yes.
Detective Sergeant Hathaway.
I know.
You do?
You used to be our Head Boy.
I was only in second year when you left, but I remember your nickname.
I didn't know I had one.
You were called WC.
I am scared to ask.
It was short for Wolfgang Christ.
The theory was, you couldn't decide whether you wanted to be Mozart or Jesus.
And now you're a policeman.
I compromised.
Tell me about the Turnbull lecture.
Not sure what I can tell you.
You were on the committee.
That's just words.
It was basically Jo's gang.
She called the shots, told us what to do.
What was your job in Jo's gang?
I didn't really have one any more.
Would you care to elaborate?
Jo and I used to be an item, until she dumped me.
When did she dump you?
When I stopped being useful.
I would welcome a little more in the way of an explanation.
Three months ago, I was a star.
Rugby international, big clubs waving fat contracts under my nose, hanging out with the rich and famous.
Then, 20 stone of Australian landed on my knee.
There's nobody more irrelevant than an injured sportsman.
Why did you get her the gun?
It's what she wanted.
She always got what she wanted.
Until now.
I guess.
Where did you get it?
It was kicking about the house.
Got a lot of guns kicking about the house?
It was a family heirloom.
Probably my grandfather's.
He was in the war.
I cleaned it up, polished it, wrapped it in pink ribbon.
Those things kill people, you know.
It's all right, I didn't give her any bullets.
She wouldn't have been safe with bullets.
She was as hard as nails, but she would never kill anybody.
Just hang them out to dry.
Do you mean Professor Weller?
I mean generally.
All right, she made a lot of enemies, but she wouldn't kill any of them, and they wouldn't kill her.
And yet she ended up dead.
I know.
It's stupid and unfair.
Got anyone else in your life at the moment?
Are we talking women?
We're talking women.
The international cap still works its magic.
Jo aside, it's any prize on the stall.
Thanks for tonight.
It wasn't fun exactly, but er... it was sort of canny.
Is that allowed?
Sort of canny is allowed.
Good night.
This is good stuff.
Another gift from a grateful hack.
To Jo.
May she rest in peace.
Not possible.
Let's hope she got the going rate.
"My night of passion with doomed bestseller."
I imagine the grieving widow is not best pleased.
Is she grieving?
I'd say she was...in shock.
The tears will come later.
True, sir, the old boyfriend bit?
Not that it's any of my business.
When I was in the sixth form and she was in the fifth,
I took her to a disco.
And then I took her to a football match.
And then I bought a couple of tickets to a concert, but she didn't want to go because she didn't like Barry Manilow.
End of story.
Did you like Barry Manilow?
No, not much.
I thought she might.
It was a lousy match, as well.
Lost 2-1 to Blackburn Rovers.
He's expecting us?
Yep.
So these are the spires where he does his dreaming.
Not much else he can do with them, really.
Professor Weller, we're told the Sam in the headline refers to you.
It does indeed.
It's a literary allusion.
Dickensian, yeah.
We know about that, too.
Is it true?
What is truth?
Men have been debating that in this place for hundreds of years.
Are you involved in an examination scam?
Scam.
Could you define the word?
A confidence trick.
A...cheat.
A swindle.
Is that precise enough for you?
Could you give me an example?
Well, imagine my daughter is at school and she wants to come to your college.
I give the school a large sum of money.
The school gives your college a large sum of money.
Now, these sums of money are given fancy names, like "endowments", though I think they should be called bribes.
Either way, lo and behold, my daughter gets her place at your college.
Well, that isn't my view of the situation.
Give us your view of the situation.
My view of the world is dominated by books.
Books are my life and my work.
But if I look out of the window,
I see a world dominated not by books but by information.
My students use words like "blog" and "iPod"
and "Googlewhack" and "cyberspace".
Well, I try to understand.
I even attended the late Mr Turnbull's lecture, hoping to gain some sort of insight.
Yes, I saw you there.
Of course.
The immediate consequence is that instead of recommending particular books that applicants might read, one tends to direct them to...websites.
Is that the word?
That's the word.
Where they might find enlightenment.
Or where my daughter, who wants to come to your college, might find the right answers to questions which you might ask her, if, for example, she was sitting your special entrance exams, or coming for an interview?
Don't tell me, Professor, there are no right answers.
Quite so.
This was Jo Gilchrist's college?
It was.
So one of your own students was running a vicious campaign against you?
What were you proposing to do about that?
I cannot tell a lie, I was considering various options.
But they did not include homicide.
And I shall make two more points before you leave.
It was not my idea to run university education according to the principles of a Middle Eastern marketplace.
And since my area of expertise begins with the work of Aeschylus over 2,500 years ago... ..your concerns seem to me but brief and impermanent ripples on a vast ocean.
Oh, I'd like to nick that professor.
On what charge?
Being a pompous sod.
And I'd burn this place down.
I'm going to prison.
I'll feel more at home in prison.
You have locks in an open prison?
One or two.
But we er...don't rattle the keys.
It upsets the inmates.
Mind you, this one's to stop the teachers from escaping.
Ha!
Did you know Nicky Turnbull?
Yeah, I knew him.
Any thoughts, observations?
Once a thief...
Dr Patterson might disagree.
Doctor?
PhD in Criminology.
She believes in rehabilitation.
Hah!
Tell me about Diane Turnbull.
Not much to tell.
She came to us with a slender CV, at a time when we'd take anyone who could read or write.
Slender?
Failed actress - or should I say actor?
She'd buggered about in fringe theatre, a couple of bit parts in The Bill.
How did she get on here?
Surprisingly well.
Oh, being a woman helps.
Someone for the guys to lust after.
And she did a halfway decent production of Julius Caesar.
I've got a present for you.
The souvenir programme.
Turnbull played Caesar?
Yes.
Any good?
Well, I've never met a Roman who spoke with a Geordie accent, but then again, I've never met one who sounded like John Gielgud, either.
Diane played his wife.
Calpurnia.
Caesar's wife, who must be above suspicion.
She wasn't Mrs Turnbull then, of course.
I know.
Diane Fraser.
I went to school with her.
Oh, in which case, she too must be above suspicion.
Well, I don't see her as a serial killer with a high-velocity rifle.
Yes, that's more of a male speciality.
Turnbull told me that he might have made some enemies while he was here.
Obviously.
The man was a thief.
Your officer said that.
What did he steal?
Have you read his book?
No, I delegated that job to my sergeant.
He's done a speed-reading course.
The bones of it are true, about the computer fraud, and so on, but he dressed it up with stuff he heard from other inmates.
He may have changed their names, but it was obvious what he was up to.
He stole their stories?
These days, it's called "intellectual property".
But is it enough for anyone to want to murder him?
Come on, Mr Lewis.
You've been around these people as long as I have.
Men have been killed for a packet of cigarettes or a bar of chocolate.
And it's not stealing a story, it's stealing someone's dignity.
Something else you should know.
It's a technical term.
When Turnbull first arrived here, he was functionally illiterate.
What, he couldn't read or write?
He could fool the system, and he was obviously brilliant with numbers.
I knew he had a problem with spelling.
Yeah, it should have been spotted at school, but it wasn't.
The man was a great talker, but...
Mrs Turnbull wrote the book?
Pass.
Oh, there was a theory that I might have been the target.
Well, that might easily be the case.
These are career criminals.
One copper less is a step nearer to heaven.
Mind how you go.
Medical and Ballistics think that's where our killer shot Nicky Turnbull from.
Did they find anything useful?
No.
How did he get up there?
Lift to the fourth floor, fire escape out onto the roof.
So he went straight past the main reception?
He went past Chloe, who's a PPE student working her way through college.
CCTV?
Inconclusive.
Can you imagine David Harvey doing this?
Harvey?
He gets the brush off from Joe Gilchrist.
She's going off, doing unspeakable things with the ex-con.
He's been drinking, he follows her.
He's a big lad, his knee's hurting, loses his temper.
Why would he kill Turnbull?
Well, classic situation.
The old favourite.
Turnbull sees him do it, so Harvey has to kill the witness.
I don't buy it, sir.
Why not?
Well, amongst other things, he er... ..well, he went to my old school.
I assume we're talking a posh public school for boys.
Yeah.
You go from there to places like Oxford, end up running the country.
With respect, this is beginning to sound like a chip on your shoulder.
My school motto was "A healthy body, a healthy mind."
We were given the choice.
Let's go and talk to Mrs Turnbull about Julius Caesar.
Where are all those actors now?
Did he steal their stories?
Well, Caesar was killed by a group of conspirators.
Got to check Brutus, Cassius, Casca...
This is Oxford, not Ancient Rome.
They're easily confused, sir.
Jim Winston.
Sad story.
Schizophrenic.
He threw himself under a train last month.
Charlie Read.
Yeah, he was stage manager.
As strong as a horse.
Bit of a nutter.
I remember him.
Local man.
Morse and I put him away for...
GBH with knobs on.
He might be worth checking.
He's the only one who really scared me.
Put an asterisk next to Charlie.
Stuart Malcolm.
No, he's probably in London.
Keep your distance.
He's beyond redemption.
Even Shakespeare couldn't help.
Ray Hanson.
He's my success story.
He runs a little car hire company.
He brought me here yesterday, actually.
Oh, in the flash limo with tinted windows.
Yeah.
Where is he based?
About halfway between here and London.
I've...
I've got his card somewhere.
Here.
I think those are the only ones I know about.
More slaving over a hot computer.
Looking for wisdom.
Well, thank you for that.
There's something else, actually.
Um...
It's sort of personal.
See you back at the station.
I...er...hate to be a nuisance, but my taxi still seems to be conspicuous by its non-appearance.
I'm sorry, Mr Webster.
I'll call them again.
Would you?
You're American?
Yes.
I blame my parents.
Who else?
A detective?
Investigating a double murder?
And here I am, an American leaving town.
Successful visit?
Mm.
Lecturing the British on the James brothers.
William and Henry, as opposed to Frank and Jesse.
Judging from the size of my audience, I made the wrong choice.
My latest thin volume.
I see.
I read in one of your newspapers Mr Turnbull might have been targeted by the Pentagon.
I give you my word, Detective,
I despise my elected government.
I can't even spell CIA.
Well, we knew about your lectures.
We had you checked out.
I hope you find that reassuring.
What's the problem?
This place.
I wish I could afford to stay here.
The staff have been lovely, and so on.
It's...
It's just that I'm sleep...
Well, I'm not sleeping along the corridor from where the girl was murdered.
And I look out the window and I can see Nicky's blood stains.
You could go home.
Yeah.
I know, but...
Well, the house is gonna seem very empty without Nicky, and... ..when I do go, I want to take all of his things with me and the police have still got them.
The wheels of forensic examination grind exceedingly slowly.
It's just a few of his bits and pieces, you know, for company.
It's probably hard for you to understand.
No, it's very easy for me to understand.
Sorry?
My wife died three years ago.
I'm sorry.
I'll see what we can do.
BIRDSONG
Are you allowed to stop for a moment?
Five minutes.
Is this part of your rehab?
Five miles per day, plus five hours in the gym, plus the occasional game of tennis as my designated fun.
I thought rugby was only a game.
Games aren't games any more.
You were with Jo and Caroline at the hotel after that lecture.
What time did you leave?
I was so drunk, I couldn't put a time to it.
What about yesterday afternoon, say around two o'clock?
What were you doing?
This.
What, here?
More or less.
I can't be accurate to the exact yard.
Any witnesses?
Yes.
Her.
Good afternoon, Mr Lewis.
What's he been telling you?
What should he have been telling me?
That Jo chose to live dangerously and lost.
So who won?
We won't know until the game's over and somebody sings.
You're suggesting Mrs Turnbull should stay at your house tonight?
Why?
She's in a state of shock.
She hates that hotel.
There's been one murder on the premises and her husband was killed on the doorstep.
She doesn't want to go home alone, and
- You were at school together.
Therefore she trusts me.
She might be a key witness.
Or even, at this stage, a possible suspect.
I don't see her as an assassin.
I'm thinking like a lawyer, in court, looking to discredit the police.
And I'm thinking like an old friend who always behaves strictly by the book.
All right.
But with back-up.
Come in!
Yeah, what is it?
I've stumbled across some wisdom.
Share it with us.
Charlie Read works as a bouncer at The Lower Depths.
What, in God's name, is The Lower Depths?
It's a basement club.
Loud music and booze.
Er...
Town and Gown meet there.
The lads from the estate get together with the athletes from the University there every weekend for a punch-up.
Charlie will be in his element.
Charlie.
Mr Lewis.
How are you doing?
Too many murders.
Otherwise, fine.
I was sorry to hear about Morse.
He was a bastard, but...a straight bastard.
Know what I mean?
Is this about my landlord?
Your landlord?
He thinks I killed his dog.
Did you?
This young man's trying to get me into trouble.
I'll speak to him later.
So er...it must be about the nutty professor, then.
Now you're getting warmer.
Can you come back in the morning, Mr Lewis?
We've got a martial arts team from Liverpool in tonight.
I think I'm needed.
Should we call the police?
These people are pretty good at sorting out their own problems.
Besides, I'm running late.
My lodger will think - You don't love her any more.
Sorry...sir.
That sort of slipped out.
I've had a long day.
And it isn't over yet.
What happens next?
Well, you go to bed for a good night's sleep, and I'll be in here with...
a good book.
It's not bad.
Dr Patterson at the prison told me that you helped him write it.
She said Nicky was, quote, "functionally illiterate".
That's the jargon.
It just means he couldn't spell.
But he told a good story.
That's what people buy, good stories.
I just helped him with the long words.
I'll be off.
Thank you for looking after me.
Just doing my job, ma'am.
No Barry Manilow, then.
Nah, I never liked him much.
But when I was 18, I thought you would.
We never know anything, do we?
Did you have a good marriage?
It's just I couldn't help noticing the photographs.
Yeah, very good.
The best.
I'm glad about that.
So did I.
People wouldn't believe me, but... ..I did.
It was living dangerously, but... ..yeah, it was very good indeed.
Ah, well see, that's the difference.
I believe in living safely.
I dare say that's why I'm a cop.
I want to look after the people that believe in living safely.
Do police regulations permit you to give me a good night hug?
I'd have to sign for it.
You're a good man.
I dare say.
Don't worry, I'm not an assassin.
I detected that.
Come in.
We traced some of the calls on Turnbull's mobile.
It turns out one was to a London-based lawyer who refused to tell us what the call was about.
Client confidentiality.
That old thing.
Yeah.
But I've got a mate who's a barrister.
Someone I went - Went to school with?
Yeah.
And?
And, according to him, the man Turnbull was talking to was a divorce lawyer.
And, according to the lady, it was a very good marriage.
(Obviously someone didn't think so.)
Norman?
You're a miserable sod.
Have you got a good memory for suicides?
Exactly.
Horses for courses.
Morning.
Hello.
I was expecting to see Robbie.
Has he gone?
The master of the house?
Yeah.
Oh.
I was all geared up to making some breakfast.
Would you like some?
Er...no, thanks, I'm sorted.
But you're to make yourself at home, and when you're ready, I am to drive you to the office.
He'd like to ask you a couple of questions, if you feel up to it.
Yeah.
Do you think he'll mind if I tidy up first?
Doubt it.
This er...nutty professor, he comes up to me and he says, "Forgive me, this isn't my natural habitat, but I'm informed you are a renowned practitioner of enforcing."
His exact words.
I'll never forget 'em.
So I tell him...it's my chosen specialist subject.
Then he says some student's making trouble, needs a bit of a slap.
And did you give this student a bit of a slap?
He didn't say it was a woman, did he?
I mean, I'll smack anyone if the money's right.
But never a woman.
Even Mr Morse give me credit for that.
Check your records.
What about Turnbull?
Have you got an alibi?
I can soon get one.
Serious answer, Charlie.
Yeah, all right.
Here's your serious answer.
You're looking for a professional hit man.
Firing rifles off of rooftops?
Ain't my style.
You know that.
I can't stand heights, for one thing.
I can't stand guns.
And I don't kill people.
I hurt people, I don't kill 'em.
Were there any professional hit men in the nick?
There's usually one or two.
I think the lad who played Brutus used to be in that line of business.
I read Turnbull's book last night, slowly.
He writes about a hitman...
called Roy.
Alias Ray Hanson.
He was Brutus in the play.
Her success story.
The one with the executive limo and the tinted windows.
The Roman formerly known as Roy Hardwick.
Ex-British army and SAS.
Served in Northern Ireland.
Suspected of selling guns to anyone who would meet his price.
Now, he disappears, and three years later, Ray Hanson turns up in the City of London, selling non-existent shares.
Do you want me to have a word with him?
I want you to get him up here for elevenses, with discretion.
It's the better part of my valour, sir.
Oh, where did you leave Mrs Turnbull?
With a Guardian crossword and a cup of coffee.
Oh, and she tidied up your kitchen before we left.
Oh, I bet she put everything back in the wrong place.
Yes, I took them to Oxford.
Nicky and Diane both.
Did you pick them up from home?
Nicky from their big house in Wandsworth.
Diane was already here when we got the call about the shooting.
That's her car there.
What was she doing here?
I'm writing a book.
Isn't everybody?
Where were you at the time of the murders?
That all depends on when they were exactly.
I only know what the newspapers tell me.
The student was killed at around two in the morning.
When I was fast asleep in my bed.
All alone.
Unless you'll accept Arthur C Clarke as a witness.
Nicky Turnbull was shot at ten past two in the afternoon.
When I was out somewhere on the road.
Let me check.
Um...
Do you have one of these?
I'm a bit of a nerd, but I find accurate information helps convince the Revenue that I really am fully rehabilitated.
Now you should know all that I know.
Thank you.
Did you get on with Nicky Turnbull?
Yeah, he's a good mate.
Was a good mate, rest his soul.
He was er...
like a sort of best friend at school.
Enemies?
When Diane walked into the nick, ooh, you can imagine.
And she picked Nicky Turnbull.
When we got to the scene where everyone kills Julius Caesar, it was just as well we only had wooden daggers.
Well, you played Brutus.
Et tu, Brute?
Yes, I know.
The best friend who turns on him in the end.
Still, it's only a play, Sergeant.
Trust me, I am an honourable man.
Just ask the Inland Revenue.
I wonder if you could spare an hour of your time.
There's one or two things we'd like you to look at down at the station.
It's always a pleasure to be of service to the state.
In fact, I have to pick up Diane anyway, so...
I'll follow you in the limo.
If that's OK.
Where is he?
Interview room with a cup of coffee.
Here are his work records.
Here's an alibi I prepared earlier.
Quite so.
Why would he want to kill Turnbull?
If he's a professional hit man, because somebody paid him to.
Who, for example?
Mrs Turnbull, for example.
What?
I know you went to the same school, sir.
That's got nothing to do with it.
They sold the film rights for what, a million quid?
As his agent, she gets what, 10%?
As his divorced wife, she might get half, but as his widow, she gets the lot.
Excuse me.
Have you any idea what's going on?
Very rarely.
Are you a policewoman, police person?
Sorry, I don't know what they're called.
I'm just an itinerant doctor delivering a file.
Ah, right.
You're Mrs Turnbull, aren't you?
Yeah.
Tough time you're having.
Aye, you could say.
Simple question.
Are you and Roy Hardwick one and the same person?
This might help.
Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that you're right.
One of the things you learn in the SAS is how to withstand interrogation, including torture by much nastier people than you, Mr Lewis.
If I've got this right, you think I'm involved in the murder of a student and a criminal turned best-selling author.
Now, I've provided you with two perfect alibis.
It's over to you.
I've nothing more to say.
We installed it as a disincentive to the parish vandals.
Some of them seem to have a deep dislike of our stained glass.
Is it important?
It may be the answer to our prayers.
Which proves they do work.
Let's see if I can remember where I left that instruction book.
Sorry to have kept you hanging around.
That's all right.
I had a nice talk with Dr Hobson.
I think she fancies you.
Why was...your late husband making telephone calls to divorce lawyers?
Because we were getting a divorce.
You told me last night you had a very good marriage.
And so we did, for a while.
There's a time limit on rock'n'roll marriages.
You can go off living dangerously.
How would you describe your relationship with Ray Hanson?
Professional.
Did you spend the night there?
Yes.
And I spent last night at your place, too, but...
We're only good friends.
He is writing a book, for God's sake.
What, Confessions Of A Hit Man?
And you're helping him with the long words?
There's no need, he's very good with long words.
He did an Open University degree in English when he was inside.
Rehabilitation.
Wherever you look.
Sir.
I've a confession to make.
I don't need a confession from you.
I play music.
That doesn't sound like a criminal offence.
Well, some people think so.
Strictly speaking, it's world music with a combination of jazz and medieval madrigals.
Does it have tunes?
I'll give it to you.
You can decide for yourself.
Anyway, on Thursday night, we were rehearsing at All Saints, and when I walked out, this car goes past a bit too fast.
I went to check if they had any CCTV this morning, and look.
That's the car that tried to run us down after the lecture.
When Hanson claimed he was safely tucked up in bed.
It was just a wheeze Ray and Nicky dreamed up to add credibility to the death-threat scam.
Trust me, Ray was aiming to miss.
He's very good.
He's had experience as a getaway driver.
We checked with the bank.
Last week, you paid Hanson £5,000.
That was a publisher's advance.
And it wasn't exactly £5,000.
It was minus my commission and plus VAT.
All right, let's go right back to the beginning.
Jo Gilchrist approached you to get Nicky...
No, she didn't.
She didn't?
No, Jo Gilchrist had nothing to do with it.
It was um...
Oh, that rugby player guy.
He...he made the initial phone call.
He confirmed everything by email, confirmed the emails by letters.
The guy bored us into submission.
But we were told that Jo was the one that called the shots.
You might choose your words more carefully.
Yeah, Norman.
Did you find something for me?
We're looking for David Harvey.
He's playing tennis with his girlfriend.
Where?
I know.
Girlfriend?
It's called real tennis.
What's that they play at Wimbledon?
Digital?
I'm in the middle of a game.
I'm sorry.
The game, you might say, is up.
Oh, bugger.
I suppose you've got the building surrounded.
And the airports sealed off.
We know you've got an iffy leg, but even so.
I can jog, but I can't run.
And I've got nothing to hide.
You're invited too, Chloe.
"It's often said computer crime leaves no victims.
I wish it were true.
I never thought I'd feel remorse for an accountant, but I'm still sorry about the man in one of our older universities who committed suicide as a result of my activities."
End quote.
I checked with an old mate of mine who works for the Oxford Mail.
The man who took his own life was financial adviser to Trevelyan College and St Jude's.
They lost millions, he lost his career and killed himself.
And he was your father.
Yes.
It was a spineless thing to do and he left the family in a mess.
Ah.
A bit of a wimp, eh?
Not a proper rugby-playing man like his son.
No, you're made of sterner stuff.
You invited Turnbull to Oxford.
What was the plan?
Get him up here and teach him a lesson?
I mean, he was only a Geordie upstart.
He didn't even go to a posh school.
Don't look now, but your inverted snobbery is showing, Mr Lewis.
Yeah, it's an old weakness of mine.
I thought it might be amusing to give Turnbull a fright, that's all.
So how come two people are dead?
You're the ace detective.
What's that old saying about Rugby Union?
Um...
Gentlemen acting like hooligans.
It's a man's game.
But you're hooligan through and through, aren't you?
Hooligan to the last slice.
I was talking to a hooligan this morning.
A real-life hooligan.
Not a gilded amateur.
It's his career.
His calling, you might say.
He was asked to teach Jo Gilchrist a lesson, offered money for it.
But he refused.
Do you know why?
He said he couldn't do that to a woman.
A hooligan, but a man of principle.
You wouldn't know a principle if it smacked you on the nose.
We phoned your old school this morning.
Talked to your house master.
You've had a bit of form, haven't you?
Suspended twice for hitting younger boys.
Did you shop me?
Don't be ridiculous.
And suspended again last rugby season for breaking an opponent's jaw.
I was getting in first with the revenge.
It's standard procedure.
Hitting a woman?
That's not standard procedure.
Not in a civilised society.
Not when you've just given her a lovely birthday present.
One word, Mr Lewis.
Evidence.
Evidence.
Found?
In a jacket in Mr Harvey's room.
Your room.
The one you were wearing the night of the lecture.
So what was the deal?
Jo would bring the revolver, you'd bring the bullets?
Only she chickened out.
Is that it?
See, that's the problem with women.
You can't rely on them, can you?
Not like proper, well-educated, hooligan chaps.
She thought it was a great idea at first.
A murder plot.
"Wow!" she said. "How cool is that!"
Then she met Turnbull and he charmed the hell out of her.
"We can't kill him," she said.
"He's kind of cute."
That was the moment.
When she said those words.
"Kind of cute."
I don't do business with "kind of cute".
And Chloe.
Did she have a different attitude to cuteness?
Maybe she thinks you're kind of cute.
Maybe she does.
Cute enough to give you access to the hotel roof?
Cute enough to look after your rifle for you?
I see no rifle.
We found one in her locker at the hotel.
She told us the whole story.
Women don't seem to have much luck where you're concerned, do they?
Any prize on the stall.
Now do you believe me?
I may not be above suspicion, but I'm not Lady Macbeth.
I believe you.
Imagine if I had liked Barry Manilow.
No...
I can't imagine that.
This way, madam.
Do you ever go back to your school?
No.
I'm probably a great disappointment to them.
You?
Yours?
No, never.
The job of a school is to teach you how to manage without it.
A bit like being a parent.
Have you used one of these?
What is it?
Stick it in your ear and you'll hear.
What?
It's that music that I do.
Oh, thanks.
Yeah.
Oh, hi, pet.
Yeah, sorry I haven't phoned you back.
Ah, you've been watching your old dad on the telly, eh?
Wow.
Well, would you believe I went to school with her?
What?
Ah, well, you see, my sergeant's in a group.
Apparently, it's world music with elements of jazz, rock and medieval madrigals.
Oh, I'm fine.
Except someone's tidied the kitchen and now I can't find my sugar bowl.
transcript:chocolate sync:innuit
And, since we aren't big travelers, we weren't sure what to pack, so we packed everything.
We weren't going on vacation, though.
We were going to take care of the most recent item on my list :
"Got Catalina kicked out of America."
You see, recently, I was on a winning streak gambling.
No matter what I bet on...
Hey, buddy !
...I just couldn't lose.
You can't lose, Earl.
But I got so caught up in gambling, I forced Catalina to drive without a license and get pulled over.
She was too worried about her boobs escaping to make an escape of her own, and she was deported.
You have to believe me.
I am an American.
McDonald's !
Disneyland !
Jim Belushi !
And, because of me,
Randy lost his chance to finally tell Catalina how he felt about her.
You think Catalina's been robbed... or murdered ?
Or gone out on a date ?
Any of those would be my worst nightmare but, if I had to pick one, I guess I hope she gets robbed.
We'll keep our fingers crossed, Randy, but I wouldn't worry.
I mean, it's her own country.
She's got to have friends down there.
How come you always get to be the bandit ?
'Cause, when you're the bandit, you always cave in when women cry and beg for the lives of their children.
Plus, I have the mustache.
- My mother could be the bandit.
- Shut up, cleaning lady.
Lots to do today on my list.
You and your stupid list.
Numero ochenta y seis :
"Steal the donkey from a one-legged girl."
You tip over the girl, I'll get the donkey.
Since the draw string handles on Randy's luggage had already broken, and I didn't want the same thing to happen to mine, we decided to get a proper suitcase.
Unfortunately, my ex-wife still had mine.
Listen, Joy, I to get that suitcase my dad gave me for my 18th birthday.
We don't have a lot of time, so I don't want to fight about it.
Lemonade ?
It's pink flavor.
What did you do to it ?
Hey, sweetie pants, the world is filled with sunshine and pink lemonade if you'd just learn to trust people.
I'll get the suitcase.
Oh, and Randy, I made a gingerbread house this morning.
You can nibble on the roof if you want.
Hey, fellas.
Hey, Crab Man.
What's up with Joy ?
Her lady lawyer put her on some prescription medication to make sure she doesn't lose her temper in court.
You know how sometimes people say, "Take a chill pill" ?
Joy did.
I wish she was taking those pills back when you were married to her.
Me, too.
All she ever took back then was cough syrup and strawberry wine.
Made her horny for ten minutes, then she'd just get pissed.
If I wasn't quick enough in bed, I'd get punched in the junk.
Yeah.
When it gets towards nine minutes, I try to get behind her.
Is that George Clooney standing in my living room ?
Randy, your hair looks great.
Are you doing something different like the movie stars do ?
I slept on my left side instead of my right.
And then, in the morning, it was itchy back here, so I did this.
Well, it is working for you, sugar butt.
I tell you, if there was a Perfect Ten magazine for ex-brother-in-laws, they'd put you on the cover.
Suitcase !
Suitcase.
- Man, those are some powerful pills.
- Yeah.
Unfortunately, Mr. Turtle got ahold of one.
- I have to keep flipping him.
- We finally made it to the airport, and it turns out airport people ask a lot more questions than bus people.
How many individuals are flying ?
Two.
- And when would you like to depart ?
- Whenever's good for the pilot.
I mean, we're ready to go now, but whenever the pilot's ready to go.
Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
I want a chair seat.
Either one's fine.
Passports ?
Past sports ?
Hmm.
Uh... well, played a little baseball, and some soccer as a kid.
No, sir.
To leave the country, you both need passports.
- Identification.
- Oh, passports.
I think you only need those if you're a foreigner.
We're American.
Turns out even Americans need passports, so we went to the passport office where we filled out a few forms and got our pictures taken.
And they only had one requirement when you get your picture taken:
You had to keep your eyes open.
Which I could never seem to do.
Come on, Earl.
I'm trying, Randy.
Then Randy had an idea.
Perfect.
Your eyes are brown.
They look green in this picture.
Uh.. yeah.
I, uh...
I recently had a double eye transplant.
They're from a pig.
Uh, they tried to find one with green eyes but, well, unfortunately, they save those for famous people.
Okey dokey.
While me and Randy were having trouble getting to Catalina's village, she was having trouble getting used to life back at home.
Why are you taping that old lady to a chair ?
I kidnapped my friend's mother.
He is sick of living with her, so I'm going to make her smoke cigarettes until she dies.
This is the cruelest, most unjustified kidnapping I have ever seen.
How many have you seen ?
Six or so.
Oh.
Why is everyone taking their shoes off ?
They have make sure there aren't explosives in them.
Explosives ?
Yeah.
It's happened.
Hey.
Whoo...
- Sir, come with me, please.
- Hey, Earl, throw your shoes.
If they don't blow up, you get to go to the front of the line.
The good thing about going your whole life without ever having flown on an airplane is everything is new to you.
Hey, Earl, Sky Mall.
There's a mall in the sky.
If this plane stops there,
I want to get Catalina one of these hot dog cookers that cooks the buns and the wieners at the same time.
Doesn't say it's the perfect gift for the love of your life, but obviously it is.
I had always wondered how a big airplane like this could fly.
Turns out the ushers had their doubts, too.
In the event of an emergency evacuation, please calmly make your way to the emergency exit nearest you.
Damn.
Uh, sorry to bother you, sir, but it seems that our row is exactly in the middle of the two emergency exits, so we should decide now who should go to the front and who should go to the back if we have to get the hell out of here.
Sure.
We'll go to the front.
Uh...
listen.
Is... ?
We'll go to the back.
Good. 'Cause I already had it in my head that way.
And you'll tell her, right ?
And, in the event of an emergency water landing, your seat may be used as a flotation device.
Um... excuse me ?
Ma'am ?
You... you just said my seat may be used as a flotation device.
Is that "may" be as in "can" be or "maybe" like "maybe yours will, or maybe yours won't" ?
'Cause I didn't ask for a floating seat.
I would have, but that wasn't one of the choices.
All the seats float, sir.
And, if there's a crash on land, will these seat cushions break our fall ?
Earl, be quiet.
You're going to get us thrown out.
And, in the event that the cabin loses pressure, oxygen masks will fall from the ceiling.
That's it.
No, thank you.
- This is my stop.
- Earl !
You know, you might try sprinkling in a few stories about what happens in the event the plane doesn't crash.
Since it turned out plane scare the crap out of me,
I was looking into other ways of getting to Catalina.
We could take a bus for the first 13 days, and it looks like it's all donkey from there.
Donkeys can swim, right ?
Hey, you guys back from Catalina's already ?
We didn't go.
Someone was afraid to fly.
Someone whose name rhymes with "girl,
"as in "sissy girl," who wears flannel shirts.
Do you still need more hints ?
Because it's Earl.
Look.
I just don't understand how something that big can stay in the air.
- The wings don't even flap.
- Earl, it's okay to be afraid.
Fear is just your feelings asking for a hug.
- I like the new Joy.
- I don't.
I mean, I still enjoy her old hotness, but new Joy doesn't have any fight in her.
Those pills make her, like, Finland.
I didn't fall in love with Finland, Earl.
There was a reason Darnell was missing Joy's fight.
Their new neighbors wanted a bigger front yard, so they parked their double-wide closer to Joy and Darnell.
Honey, we're out of toilet paper !
Too close.
Well, go to the store and get some !
I can't really do that right now !
Well, neither can I !
I'm painting the coffee stains out of the mugs !
Aren't you gonna do something ?
Of course I am.
Here you go, sweetheart.
Be careful.
They have bleach in them, so they might burn a little.
Hey, wait.
If there's a pill that can make Joy not mean,
I bet there's a pill that can make you not a sissy.
Maybe I could break it up and put it in your apple sauce.
Shoot.
Why did I tell you that ?
I know.
I'll just squish it in a banana.
Damn it.
I did it again.
- Now I'm running out of fruits.
- Randy, I can swallow a pill whole.
No.
I want to sneak it to you in something.
I hope the pill's small because I know how you love blueberries.
Crap !
So, to get the pills, we went to the only doctor we knew.
So, Earl, Randy.
Says here that I haven't seen you boys since you were ten.
Well, you know, you get busy.
I haven't been seeing another doctor, if that's what you're worried about.
- Do you still give out lollipops ?
- On the way out, if you're good.
So, Earl, I see you have some anxiety about flying.
Well, actually, more about crashing.
Crashing and dying.
I can write you up a prescription for a sedative that should help you.
Now, since you're going to Latin America,
I assume you've had your inoculations ?
- Here we go with the up sell.
- Come on, now.
You want to make sure you don't get any diseases.
- I'll just give you one shot.
- No, no, no, no, no, no !
No, thank you, Doc.
I...
I don't like needles.
I'll just get whatever diseases they have down there.
- I'm fine with that.
- Just get the shot, Earl.
Don't be a wuss.
I'm not a wuss, Randy.
I just don't think I need...
Whoops !
That's a sharp one.
Earl, the love of my life is down there.
Plus, she's on your list.
You got to do this.
Why do I have to get the shot ?
They got the diseases down there.
How come they all can't get shots ?
Fine.
Do whatever you want.
I'm sorry, Randy.
I just think there's other ways we can...
Ow !
Son of a bitch !
How did I not see that coming ?
!
So I took the pills, and me and Randy headed back to the airport to get on the plane.
But I was already flying.
Whoo !
Check-in !
Yep, these pills were something else.
I liked 'em.
And as the plane was about to take off,
I left the wild-ride-on-the-suitcase while screaming-at-strangers phase and entered the calm leeping-in-my-seat and-drooling-on-my-shirt phase.
- Man, those pills are great.
- Yeah, you've been asleep for hours.
I know, they knocked me out just before we took off and wore off right after we landed.
That's the way to fly, Randy.
Oh, we haven't flown yet.
But you just said I was out for hours.
You were.
But we've been sitting on the runway the whole time.
Something about mechanical difficulties.
Mechanical difficulties ?
Yeah, there was a bright flash and I heard somebody scream.
They gave us animal crackers.
I ate yours.
Randy ?
!
I think we're taking off now.
They probably fixed it.
Give me the pills, Randy, I need more pills.
Well, they're in the suitcase, and the lady said it was under the plane.
But every time I open the door looking for the stairs, all I find is a teeny tiny bathroom.
Let me off !
Stop the plane !
Back it up !
No, Earl, you're not supposed to stand up during take-off.
Those ladies did a whole play about it.
Earl !
Hold it !
Sir, we are in the air.
I can't let you off the plane this time.
I'll let myself off.
I know where the emergency exits are.
Sir, don't make me do this.
Ouch !
Get the straps !
We've got a biter !
While I was struggling because I couldn't take my pills,
Darnell was struggling 'cause Joy was still taking hers.
Telephone !
What ?
!
Telephone !
Let the machine pick it up !
You've reached David and Tina Hayes.
Leave a message.
Ciao.
Hello ?
Hello ?
It's your grandmother.
Are you home ?
Pick up !
I wanted to check on Christmas plans.
I could come there, but you'd have to come pick me up.
I can just feel the Rabinitzes are serving alcohol.
Are you serving alcohol ?
If you are, I can't have it with the meal, 'cause...
Are you gonna do something about this ?
- I guess I'll have to.
- ...horrible !
And is your husband's brother going to be there ?
Ryan, is it ?
He is just...
Hello, people next door's grandma.
Don't worry about a thing.
We'll pick you up and bring you over for Christmas.
You're gonna have to do it, though.
I'm not supposed to drive on these pills.
After being tied up on an airplane for eight hours,
I was happy to walk on solid ground.
Which was good, 'cause we had about two miles of it on the way to the bus station.
Catalina's village is a five-hour bus ride.
And we have to get on the bus now 'cause it's leaving soon.
Okay, I just got to get something to eat first.
No, Earl, we don't have time.
But there's tacos, Randy.
You know how I feel about tacos.
It's the only food shaped like a smile.
A beef smile.
- I'm going.
- No, Earl, there won't be another bus going to Catalina's village until tomorrow.
So we have to get on that one.
We can eat when we get there.
That's easy for you to say.
You got to eat on the plane.
Put it down !
I'm sorry, Randy, I got to get something to eat.
No, Earl, I can't let you do that.
I wasn't asking for your permission, Randy.
Um, I wasn't asking if you were asking, Earl.
We're not missing that bus just so you can get a taco.
You're right, Randy, I'm gonna get two tacos and maybe some of that freaky white soda they got.
Uh, excuse-o, por favor.
¿Mande?
Uh... is this the end-o of the li... ?
Ah !
Let go, Randy !
Not until you get on the bus !
Quit dragging your feet, Earl.
This'll go a lot easier.
I want a taco !
You bit me !
Sorry, Randy, it had to be done.
Fine, I give up.
You can have your stupid taco when we get to Catalina's village.
- Let go !
- No !
Ah !
You're splitting me !
Then put me down !
No !
Randy...
I'm getting a taco.
Damn it, Randy !
- Now I'm hungry and blind.
- You're being such a baby.
You've been complaining the whole trip.
"Wah, wah, wah."
"I'm afraid to fly."
"I don't like needles."
"I'm hungry and blind."
Sorry, señor.
Ow !
You hungry, baby ?
You want a bottle ?
Here, have your bottle, baby.
Randy, stop it !
- No, have a bottle, baby.
- Randy, stop it !
- Have a bottle, baby.
- Randy, I'm serious.
If you don't let go, I'm gonna kill you.
I swear.
That's gross.
We're getting on the bus !
I want my taco !
Oh !
Not the 'stache !
Not the 'stache !
Not the 'stache !
Not the 'stache !
Drive.
Don't drive.
Drive.
Oh, why are you being such a jerk ?
You're the one being the jerk.
You got Catalina deported, and now you're about to let some stupid taco cost me the love of my life !
Here we go again, the love of your life.
Like you really have a chance with her.
He started it.
I know the word on the bus is I'm the jerk, but there was a whole lot of stuff that happened outside.
Is my mustache even ?
'Cause that's something he did.
He yanked on it.
No, thanks.
You know what, actually I'm starving.
I think I will take a bite.
Thank you.
Looks like a Slim Jim, tastes like a donut.
That's brilliant.
Can't believe you guys are so poor.
This is gonna be great.
My brother's freaked out by birds.
Randy's been terrified of birds his whole life.
Little ones... big ones... even those talking ones people keep as pets.
Hey, Earl, did you see what that stupid bird...
You know how when you let go of the end of a balloon and it goes flying around the room making a squealy noise ?
Well, you're about to see a grown man do the same thing.
So, I sat back and waited for the Randy balloon to start flying.
But it never did.
He was sitting face-to-beak with an upside-down chicken and he didn't even flinch.
He was so focused on getting back the woman he loved, he wasn't scared of anything not the bird, not the shots, not the airplane... not even kicking my ass.
That's when I realized if Randy's love for Catalina was that strong, he could make anything possible.
So who was I to say he didn't have a chance ?
You know what ?
He was right.
I have been a baby and a screw-up.
He's been the one that's kept it together and figured out how to get everything done.
Yeah, you're right.
Maybe that's why I yelled at him.
I don't like being the one who screws up.
Exactly.
I couldn't handle feeling like a loser, so I was trying to make him feel like one.
You know what ?
I got to tell him I'm sorry.
And from now on, if he can be brave and keep it together,
I can be brave and keep it together.
Gracias.
You.
Gringo.
Off the bus.
But my apology and bravery would have to wait.
Oh, oh, not the 'stache, not the 'stache, not the 'stache.
'Cause Randy was so focused on getting back the woman he loved, he also didn't notice his brother getting kidnapped.
I would've yelled, "I'm sorry," but there's a time to apologize and there's a time to keep your mouth shut and hope that the two crazy Latino dudes with guns don't shoot you.
Uh, i-if you guys are gonna kill me, I have a brother that you might run into.
Could you please tell him I'm sorry for all the stuff I said, and that
I'm the one who ran over Crackers ?
Cr-Crackers was our cat.
I guess I can apologize to Crackers after you kill me.
He's here.
Wait till he sees we have a gringo here.
Turns out their boss, Diego, had a real strong feeling about America.
At least what he knew about it from TV before his satellite broke in 1988.
Hey, are those Bugle Boy jeans you're wearing ?
Catalina always talked about how scary and superstitious her village was.
While I was learning about the scary,
Randy was learning about the superstitious.
Excuse me, do you mind if I take those flowers and that sandwich ?
Normally I'd ask my brother if it was all right, but I don't know where he is.
No, please, take whatever.
Thanks.
I need 'em, 'cause I'm tracking down the love of my life, and the plane I was on didn't stop at Sky Mall.
Manuel !
Mi hijo !
Those things that you hold are from our shrine, dedicated to our son, Manuel, may he rest in peace.
The sandwich isn't what killed him, is it ?
No, it was a scooter.
The charity that dropped off toys that year didn't send helmets.
Whoever eats the sandwich from the sacred shrine now carries the soul of the deceased inside him.
As the keeper of our son's soul, you must come with us to our home so we can have one final evening with our son.
An evening we never had.
I'm sorry I swallowed your son.
I can throw him up if you want me to.
But right now I'm busy looking for my friend Catalina.
Catalina from America ?
You know her ?
Catalina with the beautiful olive skin and silky hair that drapes around her creamy shoulders and comes to rest on her first-class, ample bosoms...
Jesús ?
Yes, we know her.
And I will take you to her, if you will give us one more night with our son.
I'll be your son for the night.
But I have a white mom back in America, and she can never find out about this.
Back in home, Darnell was having trouble of his own.
His neighbors had parked their house too close, and well, Joy wouldn't do anything about it, 'cause her deaf lawyer put her on happy pills to control her anger.
Can we at least shut the window when they're running the dryer ?
I like it it feels like I'm being kissed by a thousand little bunnies.
Joy, I'm serious there's little pieces of clothes in my apple brown Betty.
Well, why don't you just take your little apple brown buns over there and tell 'em how you feel ?
I tried, but you know being in the Witness Protection Program makes me uneasy.
I don't like it when strangers ask too many questions.
I brought these for you, and I wanted to ask you a favor.
- Can you please...
- What are they ?
Uh, lemon squares.
Is that powdered sugar on top ?
- Yes.
- Did you make 'em yourself ?
My name is Darnell Turner, and that's all it's ever been.
I just hope they give us back our plate.
Oh, Darnell, just let 'em keep it.
What good is a plate if you can't share it with your neighbor ?
Joy, are you even in there ?
Ow !
I just got hit by a hot penny !
Diego liked my American jeans so much, he took them.
You're a drug dealer, aren't you ?
Uh, uh, no,
- I'm not even a drug user.
- So what are you, then, a roadie trying to score drugs for a rock band ?
I seen it all.
You tell Billy Idol he's not gonna get
- his white wedding from here.
- Look, I'm not a drug guy--
I'm just looking for my friend Catalina.
Catalina ?
What's her last name ?
I don't know, it's, uh, it's something Latin-ey.
Uh, it ends in "ez" or "illa."
Tortilla ?
You're here to help your friend Catalina Tortilla ?
Uh, that-that might not be it, but she is my friend.
Pretty, long, dark hair, uh, loves to dance, a lot of jumping.
Catalina.
Catalina's my-my niece !
Why didn't you say so ?
Jump around.
I'm the cream of the crop I rise to the top
I never eat a pig, 'cause a pig is a cop.
What a small world after all.
You're her friend, and Mario's her little brother.
Nice to meet you.
All right, we'll take you to see Catalina, but first we got to run a few errands.
Uh, th-they're not dangerous, are they ?
I've been involved in a lot of crimes in my life, but this was my first time as an unarmed hostage in a Third World country.
Oh, man, they weren't lying.
It was the wrong address.
Let's send them a ham.
Spiral-cut ?
Were you in there ?
Yes, spiral-cut.
I knew karma wanted me to find Catalina and bring her back, but I also knew it didn't want me to help murder some poor guy just 'cause he was late on his goat payment.
- I can't do this.
- Why not ?
He's a little guy, so you don't have to dig so deep.
I'm sorry, but I-I can't help you do bad stuff-- if I do, I got to put it on my list, and I don't want to get on another plane and come down here and make up for it.
Hey, list ?
What list ?
It's a list of everything bad I've done.
Getting Catalina deported's on there.
That's why I got to bring her back--
I got to cross her off.
And who made you write this list, your president, Señor Reagan ?
No one made me do it--
I did it on my own after I learned about karma.
So I took a shot and told Diego everything I knew about karma.
I told him about how I was trying to make up for all the bad things I've done one by one.
So you say you learned about karma on American TV, huh ?
That's when I knew I had him.
All right.
All right, I'll try it.
Even though you owe me a lot of money, I will no longer kill you.
Instead, the new Diego
- will kill your wife.
- No, no.
Your children.
Nope.
'Kay, what, then ?
How about a payment plan ?
I choose that one.
While I was making Diego understand karma,
Randy was trying to understand what it meant to be a dead son.
Did you enjoy the flan ?
You mean the yellow, slimy stuff I took one bite of and spit back out ?
It was okay.
So what now ?
You know.
I do ?
Come on, Manuel, it is the same as every night.
More flan ?
Tickle fiesta !
Stop !
I'm gonna pee !
Let yourself go, my son-- it's the third floor !
Seeing Catalina was gonna have to wait.
As bad as Diego was, there were worse bandidos in the area, and he had to keep watch and protect the village from them.
No, Alf was from the planet Melmac he's a alien.
I thought he was a monkey.
A monkey ?
No.
He ate cats.
Why would a monkey eat a cat ?
Your monkey ate my cat.
Fine, but at least my monkey wasn't sarcastic and cracking jokes all the time.
All that talk about monkeys at bedtime made me think of Randy.
I didn't know where he was, but I sure hoped he was okay.
Hey, Earl.
Yeah, Randy ?
Do you think when everybody dies they come back as a sandwich ?
I don't know, Randy, maybe.
After I die, if you ever see a peanut butter and baloney sandwich, eat it, because that's me.
Okay.
Earl ?
Yeah, Randy ?
Do you miss me ?
Yeah, Randy, I do.
I miss you, too, Earl.
Cold.
Sí, Mami.
Randy wasn't the only one having a hard time sleeping.
Darnell found the neighbors' motion detector hard to ignore.
The next morning, Diego finally brought me to Catalina's village.
I thought the villagers would be surprised to see a pant-less American, but they were more surprised to see a friendly Diego.
Buenos dias !
Ooh, tacos !
Uh, do you think I could get my wallet back ?
- Maybe-maybe with my pants ?
- Yeah, of course.
How rude of me.
You stay here, get some tacos.
I'll go get Catalina.
I was excited about getting my pants back.
Between the cold air and the giant mosquitoes,
I had missed them quite a bit, but then I saw something I had missed even more.
Randy !
Earl !
You're okay !
I'm okay.
Mami, Papi, this is my brother Earl.
Ah, my stepson !
Oh.
I ate the soul of a dead child, and if you see one laying around, grab it-- tastes just like a sandwich, and you get to have tickle fights and pee on the floor.
Sounds great, Randy.
Listen,
I was dragged off the bus before I got to tell you this, but
I'm sorry.
You're right, I was acting like a baby, and who am I to say you don't have a chance with Catalina ?
In fact, her uncle just went to get her.
What ?
I can't see her dressed like this.
You look cute.
I don't want to look cute, Mami, I want to look like a hero-- a big, sexy hero from America that came to save her.
Mi hijo...
Stay out of my life, Mami !
Teenagers.
Yeah, those are the rough years.
Thank you so much.
No problem.
And, again, sorry about farting on your lap, buddy.
It wasn't your fault.
Maria shouldn't have tickled you so hard.
Earl !
Catalina !
I can't believe you came all this way to get me.
Well, it was my fault you got sent down here in the first place.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
And yes, I will marry you !
What ?
When my uncle told me that you will marry me so I could get my green card, I couldn't believe it.
He told you that ?
What ?
I'm sorry, did you want it to be a surprise ?
No, it still feels like a surprise.
You are a true friend, Earl.
Thank you so, so much.
I didn't know how I was gonna get back.
Aw... it's beautiful, it's beautiful.
You mess things up, you fix it-- it's karma.
Look at that.
I'm proud to have worn your pants for 14 hours.
Randy !
I am so happy !
Me, too !
Are you going to be the best man ?
The best I can be.
No, Earl's best man at the wedding.
Who's Earl marrying ?
Me, silly.
Isn't it amazing ?
He is my hero.
While Catalina and Diego were out preparing my third unplanned wedding, I was trying to find Randy, whose feelings I'd accidentally hurt... again.
Randy !
Randy !
Look, Randy, it wasn't my fault.
Diego thought that was the plan.
She's my friend.
What was I supposed to do ?
Oh, yeah ?
Well, if you like her so much, why don't you marry her ?
Oh, wait.
You are.
Walk with me, Pedro.
Look, it all happened too fast, Randy.
She was so happy, she started hugging me.
She was supposed to be hugging me.
This was my chance to be a hero and you stole it.
Randy, you can still be the hero.
We'll switch and you can be
- the one who marries her.
- No !
For me to have a chance, it needed to be perfect, Earl.
I needed to come in, save the day and sweep her off her feet.
Now I'm just gonna look pathetic and weird and I don't want to look pathetic and weird.
Come on, Pedro.
In Spanish, in Spanish, in Spanish...
While I tried to find a way to get through to Randy,
Darnell was just trying to get through the day.
Hey, Tina, how much if I can get this cupcake in the trashcan from here ?
Five bucks says you miss.
I'll split that cupcake with you, cupcake.
Joy, I need the old you back !
I'm yin, you're yang.
Yin is nice, yang's a bitch !
This house doesn't work without yang !
Nothing Darnell said could snap Joy out of her drug-induced happiness.
But something eventually did.
Beer can !
Oh, snapety, snap, snap, snap.
Excuse me.
We haven't officially met, but I'm Joy Turner from the trailer next door.
I passed you those bleach wipes for your fanny hole.
I hope you didn't take any skin off.
A little.
Good.
Listen, now, I know on the outside
I look like a real sweetie sweetheart, but trust me, on the inside I'm 100% bitch.
I even have a T-shirt that says it.
I got it for a Mother's Day present.
Anyway, here's the thing.
My lawyer's got me taking these happy pills to control my anger, but since you just used my baby boy's head as a backboard for your little trashcan basketball game,
I'm gonna stop taking 'em and come back in three days when the happy wears off.
Look at that.
A real tree.
Mm !
I love the smell of it.
Love it !
Anyhoo, when these pills wear off,
I don't know exactly what's gonna happen, but I imagine it'll involve this beer can breaking out your teeth, your wife screaming at me to stop kicking you and your children crying after they see what I've done to your face.
Heck, I might even rip off one of your ears and make it into a little coin purse.
Okay, then, so I'll be back in three days to give you that Christmas ass-kickin' I promised unless you decide that now would be a good time to move this trailer.
It's a good time to move our trailer.
Oh, that is fantastic news.
And I'm sorry, but that little Santa over there shaking his tushy is absolutely adorable.
Take him.
Really ?
Even though this was just a green-card wedding,
Catalina's village still followed all the town's traditions.
You see, this symbolizes how beautiful and admired a bride should be.
And that's to remind her not to get too full of herself.
- Seems weird.
- Oh, yeah ?
And throwing rice at people makes a lot of sense, huh ?
Wait till you see what you have to do.
In our little village, before a man is allowed to marry a woman, he has to pass three simple tests.
The first is to cross this beam without falling.
Sure, that makes sense.
Uh, excuse me a second.
I need to borrow my brother's shoes.
They have better traction for crossing beams.
What are you doing ?
Just switch shoes with me and listen.
Randy, this is your chance to be a hero.
All I have to do is fail the test and you can step in and save the day.
That's a great idea, Earl.
And then after this, let's never travel again.
All right, now that you got the proper footwear,
I can tell you that this plank represents the straight and narrow path that you as a husband must follow.
Okay, bring on the leeches !
The what ?
Leeches.
They represent, I don't know, hookers and stuff.
Just don't fall in.
Hit it.
I really wanted to stay up on that plank and away from those leeches a whole lot, but not as much as I wanted Randy to be happy.
Damn it.
Whoa !
Whoa-oa, whoa-oa !
Whoopsy daisy !
Leeches sucking my face !
Leeches sucking my face !
That's okay.
I can...
No, wait, wait.
Earl, you know what ?
The old me would have said "One and done," right ?
But karma says, "Two out of three."
To the hot coals !
To give Randy his shot, I planned on stepping on the hot coals, and then stepping right back off.
What I didn't plan on was how hard it is to change direction on hot coals.
It burned like hell, but at least
Randy was gonna be able to step in and be the hero.
I'm sorry, Catalina, but I guess I'm just not...
Earl, this is your lucky day.
One out of three ?
To the field of rakes !
Diego said something about the field of rakes representing the careful dance of talking about your wife's weight.
But for me, it represented the last chance to help Randy.
Okay, that's it.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Catalina.
I gave him several chances and he just keeps proving himself not worthy.
But how am I supposed to get back to America ?
Catalina ?
Can I try and marry you ?
You would do that ?
To the pit of leeches !
I was a little worried about Randy walking on that thin plank, 'cause I had seen him fall off sidewalks before, but if it meant rescuing Catalina, he could have danced on the head of a pin.
Yeah !
And watching Randy cross those hot coals,
I realized he probably wouldn't have failed gym class if Catalina had gone to our high school.
Everything was going great for Randy.
And even when it didn't go great, nothing stopped him.
I did it !
I did it !
And in return for his sacrifice, Randy got to marry the woman he loved.
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You're a good friend.
He thought about telling his new wife that he loved her, but he didn't want to risk ruining his wedding day.
Thanks for letting me be the hero.
You been the hero all along, Randy.
I was just getting in your way.
That's so she doesn't get too full of herself.
Oh.
Yep, it was successful trip.
I was feeling happy, and not just 'cause of my airplane pills.
I was happy 'cause I helped bring Catalina back home and
I helped get Randy closer to the woman he loved.
And I taught a bad guy about being good.
What happened ?
Who took your pants ?
Oh, man, that's my thing.
The same banditos who chopped off Mario's fingers.
This time they cut off his tongue.
They cut out your tongue ?
I don't wanna talk about it.
How dare they do this to my nephew in my village.
They said because they heard you were nice now, the could do as they please.
Oh, did they ?
Okay.
Well, forget karma.
New rule.
Do bad things and Diego happens.
Wolverine !

And, since we aren't big travelers, we weren't sure what to pack, so we packed everything.
We weren't going on vacation, though.
We were going to take care of the most recent item on my list :
"Got Catalina kicked out of America."
You see, recently, I was on a winning streak gambling.
No matter what I bet on...
Hey, buddy !
...I just couldn't lose.
You can't lose, Earl.
But I got so caught up in gambling, I forced Catalina to drive without a license and get pulled over.
She was too worried about her boobs escaping to make an escape of her own, and she was deported.
You have to believe me.
I am an American.
McDonald's !
Disneyland !
Jim Belushi !
And, because of me,
Randy lost his chance to finally tell Catalina how he felt about her.
You think Catalina's been robbed... or murdered ?
Or gone out on a date ?
Any of those would be my worst nightmare but, if I had to pick one, I guess I hope she gets robbed.
We'll keep our fingers crossed, Randy, but I wouldn't worry.
I mean, it's her own country.
She's got to have friends down there.
How come you always get to be the bandit ?
'Cause, when you're the bandit, you always cave in when women cry and beg for the lives of their children.
Plus, I have the mustache.
- My mother could be the bandit.
- Shut up, cleaning lady.
Lots to do today on my list.
You and your stupid list.
Numero ochenta y seis :
"Steal the donkey from a one-legged girl."
You tip over the girl, I'll get the donkey.
Since the draw string handles on Randy's luggage had already broken, and I didn't want the same thing to happen to mine, we decided to get a proper suitcase.
Unfortunately, my ex-wife still had mine.
Listen, Joy, I to get that suitcase my dad gave me for my 18th birthday.
We don't have a lot of time, so I don't want to fight about it.
Lemonade ?
It's pink flavor.
What did you do to it ?
Hey, sweetie pants, the world is filled with sunshine and pink lemonade if you'd just learn to trust people.
I'll get the suitcase.
Oh, and Randy, I made a gingerbread house this morning.
You can nibble on the roof if you want.
Hey, fellas.
Hey, Crab Man.
What's up with Joy ?
Her lady lawyer put her on some prescription medication to make sure she doesn't lose her temper in court.
You know how sometimes people say, "Take a chill pill" ?
Joy did.
I wish she was taking those pills back when you were married to her.
Me, too.
All she ever took back then was cough syrup and strawberry wine.
Made her horny for ten minutes, then she'd just get pissed.
If I wasn't quick enough in bed, I'd get punched in the junk.
Yeah.
When it gets towards nine minutes, I try to get behind her.
Is that George Clooney standing in my living room ?
Randy, your hair looks great.
Are you doing something different like the movie stars do ?
I slept on my left side instead of my right.
And then, in the morning, it was itchy back here, so I did this.
Well, it is working for you, sugar butt.
I tell you, if there was a Perfect Ten magazine for ex-brother-in-laws, they'd put you on the cover.
Suitcase !
Suitcase.
- Man, those are some powerful pills.
- Yeah.
Unfortunately, Mr. Turtle got ahold of one.
- I have to keep flipping him.
- We finally made it to the airport, and it turns out airport people ask a lot more questions than bus people.
How many individuals are flying ?
Two.
- And when would you like to depart ?
- Whenever's good for the pilot.
I mean, we're ready to go now, but whenever the pilot's ready to go.
Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
I want a chair seat.
Either one's fine.
Passports ?
Past sports ?
Hmm.
Uh... well, played a little baseball, and some soccer as a kid.
No, sir.
To leave the country, you both need passports.
- Identification.
- Oh, passports.
I think you only need those if you're a foreigner.
We're American.
Turns out even Americans need passports, so we went to the passport office where we filled out a few forms and got our pictures taken.
And they only had one requirement when you get your picture taken:
You had to keep your eyes open.
Which I could never seem to do.
Come on, Earl.
I'm trying, Randy.
Then Randy had an idea.
Perfect.
Your eyes are brown.
They look green in this picture.
Uh.. yeah.
I, uh...
I recently had a double eye transplant.
They're from a pig.
Uh, they tried to find one with green eyes but, well, unfortunately, they save those for famous people.
Okey dokey.
While me and Randy were having trouble getting to Catalina's village, she was having trouble getting used to life back at home.
Why are you taping that old lady to a chair ?
I kidnapped my friend's mother.
He is sick of living with her, so I'm going to make her smoke cigarettes until she dies.
This is the cruelest, most unjustified kidnapping I have ever seen.
How many have you seen ?
Six or so.
Oh.
Why is everyone taking their shoes off ?
They have make sure there aren't explosives in them.
Explosives ?
Yeah.
It's happened.
Hey.
Whoo...
- Sir, come with me, please.
- Hey, Earl, throw your shoes.
If they don't blow up, you get to go to the front of the line.
The good thing about going your whole life without ever having flown on an airplane is everything is new to you.
Hey, Earl, Sky Mall.
There's a mall in the sky.
If this plane stops there,
I want to get Catalina one of these hot dog cookers that cooks the buns and the wieners at the same time.
Doesn't say it's the perfect gift for the love of your life, but obviously it is.
I had always wondered how a big airplane like this could fly.
Turns out the ushers had their doubts, too.
In the event of an emergency evacuation, please calmly make your way to the emergency exit nearest you.
Damn.
Uh, sorry to bother you, sir, but it seems that our row is exactly in the middle of the two emergency exits, so we should decide now who should go to the front and who should go to the back if we have to get the hell out of here.
Sure.
We'll go to the front.
Uh...
listen.
Is... ?
We'll go to the back.
Good. 'Cause I already had it in my head that way.
And you'll tell her, right ?
And, in the event of an emergency water landing, your seat may be used as a flotation device.
Um... excuse me ?
Ma'am ?
You... you just said my seat may be used as a flotation device.
Is that "may" be as in "can" be or "maybe" like "maybe yours will, or maybe yours won't" ?
'Cause I didn't ask for a floating seat.
I would have, but that wasn't one of the choices.
All the seats float, sir.
And, if there's a crash on land, will these seat cushions break our fall ?
Earl, be quiet.
You're going to get us thrown out.
And, in the event that the cabin loses pressure, oxygen masks will fall from the ceiling.
That's it.
No, thank you.
- This is my stop.
- Earl !
You know, you might try sprinkling in a few stories about what happens in the event the plane doesn't crash.
Since it turned out plane scare the crap out of me,
I was looking into other ways of getting to Catalina.
We could take a bus for the first 13 days, and it looks like it's all donkey from there.
Donkeys can swim, right ?
Hey, you guys back from Catalina's already ?
We didn't go.
Someone was afraid to fly.
Someone whose name rhymes with "girl,
"as in "sissy girl," who wears flannel shirts.
Do you still need more hints ?
Because it's Earl.
Look.
I just don't understand how something that big can stay in the air.
- The wings don't even flap.
- Earl, it's okay to be afraid.
Fear is just your feelings asking for a hug.
- I like the new Joy.
- I don't.
I mean, I still enjoy her old hotness, but new Joy doesn't have any fight in her.
Those pills make her, like, Finland.
I didn't fall in love with Finland, Earl.
There was a reason Darnell was missing Joy's fight.
Their new neighbors wanted a bigger front yard, so they parked their double-wide closer to Joy and Darnell.
Honey, we're out of toilet paper !
Too close.
Well, go to the store and get some !
I can't really do that right now !
Well, neither can I !
I'm painting the coffee stains out of the mugs !
Aren't you gonna do something ?
Of course I am.
Here you go, sweetheart.
Be careful.
They have bleach in them, so they might burn a little.
Hey, wait.
If there's a pill that can make Joy not mean,
I bet there's a pill that can make you not a sissy.
Maybe I could break it up and put it in your apple sauce.
Shoot.
Why did I tell you that ?
I know.
I'll just squish it in a banana.
Damn it.
I did it again.
- Now I'm running out of fruits.
- Randy, I can swallow a pill whole.
No.
I want to sneak it to you in something.
I hope the pill's small because I know how you love blueberries.
Crap !
So, to get the pills, we went to the only doctor we knew.
So, Earl, Randy.
Says here that I haven't seen you boys since you were ten.
Well, you know, you get busy.
I haven't been seeing another doctor, if that's what you're worried about.
- Do you still give out lollipops ?
- On the way out, if you're good.
So, Earl, I see you have some anxiety about flying.
Well, actually, more about crashing.
Crashing and dying.
I can write you up a prescription for a sedative that should help you.
Now, since you're going to Latin America,
I assume you've had your inoculations ?
- Here we go with the up sell.
- Come on, now.
You want to make sure you don't get any diseases.
- I'll just give you one shot.
- No, no, no, no, no, no !
No, thank you, Doc.
I...
I don't like needles.
I'll just get whatever diseases they have down there.
- I'm fine with that.
- Just get the shot, Earl.
Don't be a wuss.
I'm not a wuss, Randy.
I just don't think I need...
Whoops !
That's a sharp one.
Earl, the love of my life is down there.
Plus, she's on your list.
You got to do this.
Why do I have to get the shot ?
They got the diseases down there.
How come they all can't get shots ?
Fine.
Do whatever you want.
I'm sorry, Randy.
I just think there's other ways we can...
Ow !
Son of a bitch !
How did I not see that coming ?
!
So I took the pills, and me and Randy headed back to the airport to get on the plane.
But I was already flying.
Whoo !
Check-in !
Yep, these pills were something else.
I liked 'em.
And as the plane was about to take off,
I left the wild-ride-on-the-suitcase while screaming-at-strangers phase and entered the calm leeping-in-my-seat and-drooling-on-my-shirt phase.
- Man, those pills are great.
- Yeah, you've been asleep for hours.
I know, they knocked me out just before we took off and wore off right after we landed.
That's the way to fly, Randy.
Oh, we haven't flown yet.
But you just said I was out for hours.
You were.
But we've been sitting on the runway the whole time.
Something about mechanical difficulties.
Mechanical difficulties ?
Yeah, there was a bright flash and I heard somebody scream.
They gave us animal crackers.
I ate yours.
Randy ?
!
I think we're taking off now.
They probably fixed it.
Give me the pills, Randy, I need more pills.
Well, they're in the suitcase, and the lady said it was under the plane.
But every time I open the door looking for the stairs, all I find is a teeny tiny bathroom.
Let me off !
Stop the plane !
Back it up !
No, Earl, you're not supposed to stand up during take-off.
Those ladies did a whole play about it.
Earl !
Hold it !
Sir, we are in the air.
I can't let you off the plane this time.
I'll let myself off.
I know where the emergency exits are.
Sir, don't make me do this.
Ouch !
Get the straps !
We've got a biter !
While I was struggling because I couldn't take my pills,
Darnell was struggling 'cause Joy was still taking hers.
Telephone !
What ?
!
Telephone !
Let the machine pick it up !
You've reached David and Tina Hayes.
Leave a message.
Ciao.
Hello ?
Hello ?
It's your grandmother.
Are you home ?
Pick up !
I wanted to check on Christmas plans.
I could come there, but you'd have to come pick me up.
I can just feel the Rabinitzes are serving alcohol.
Are you serving alcohol ?
If you are, I can't have it with the meal, 'cause...
Are you gonna do something about this ?
- I guess I'll have to.
- ...horrible !
And is your husband's brother going to be there ?
Ryan, is it ?
He is just...
Hello, people next door's grandma.
Don't worry about a thing.
We'll pick you up and bring you over for Christmas.
You're gonna have to do it, though.
I'm not supposed to drive on these pills.
After being tied up on an airplane for eight hours,
I was happy to walk on solid ground.
Which was good, 'cause we had about two miles of it on the way to the bus station.
Catalina's village is a five-hour bus ride.
And we have to get on the bus now 'cause it's leaving soon.
Okay, I just got to get something to eat first.
No, Earl, we don't have time.
But there's tacos, Randy.
You know how I feel about tacos.
It's the only food shaped like a smile.
A beef smile.
- I'm going.
- No, Earl, there won't be another bus going to Catalina's village until tomorrow.
So we have to get on that one.
We can eat when we get there.
That's easy for you to say.
You got to eat on the plane.
Put it down !
I'm sorry, Randy, I got to get something to eat.
No, Earl, I can't let you do that.
I wasn't asking for your permission, Randy.
Um, I wasn't asking if you were asking, Earl.
We're not missing that bus just so you can get a taco.
You're right, Randy, I'm gonna get two tacos and maybe some of that freaky white soda they got.
Uh, excuse-o, por favor.
¿Mande?
Uh... is this the end-o of the li... ?
Ah !
Let go, Randy !
Not until you get on the bus !
Quit dragging your feet, Earl.
This'll go a lot easier.
I want a taco !
You bit me !
Sorry, Randy, it had to be done.
Fine, I give up.
You can have your stupid taco when we get to Catalina's village.
- Let go !
- No !
Ah !
You're splitting me !
Then put me down !
No !
Randy...
I'm getting a taco.
Damn it, Randy !
- Now I'm hungry and blind.
- You're being such a baby.
You've been complaining the whole trip.
"Wah, wah, wah."
"I'm afraid to fly."
"I don't like needles."
"I'm hungry and blind."
Sorry, señor.
Ow !
You hungry, baby ?
You want a bottle ?
Here, have your bottle, baby.
Randy, stop it !
- No, have a bottle, baby.
- Randy, stop it !
- Have a bottle, baby.
- Randy, I'm serious.
If you don't let go, I'm gonna kill you.
I swear.
That's gross.
We're getting on the bus !
I want my taco !
Oh !
Not the 'stache !
Not the 'stache !
Not the 'stache !
Not the 'stache !
Drive.
Don't drive.
Drive.
Oh, why are you being such a jerk ?
You're the one being the jerk.
You got Catalina deported, and now you're about to let some stupid taco cost me the love of my life !
Here we go again, the love of your life.
Like you really have a chance with her.
He started it.
I know the word on the bus is I'm the jerk, but there was a whole lot of stuff that happened outside.
Is my mustache even ?
'Cause that's something he did.
He yanked on it.
No, thanks.
You know what, actually I'm starving.
I think I will take a bite.
Thank you.
Looks like a Slim Jim, tastes like a donut.
That's brilliant.
Can't believe you guys are so poor.
This is gonna be great.
My brother's freaked out by birds.
Randy's been terrified of birds his whole life.
Little ones... big ones... even those talking ones people keep as pets.
Hey, Earl, did you see what that stupid bird...
You know how when you let go of the end of a balloon and it goes flying around the room making a squealy noise ?
Well, you're about to see a grown man do the same thing.
So, I sat back and waited for the Randy balloon to start flying.
But it never did.
He was sitting face-to-beak with an upside-down chicken and he didn't even flinch.
He was so focused on getting back the woman he loved, he wasn't scared of anything not the bird, not the shots, not the airplane... not even kicking my ass.
That's when I realized if Randy's love for Catalina was that strong, he could make anything possible.
So who was I to say he didn't have a chance ?
You know what ?
He was right.
I have been a baby and a screw-up.
He's been the one that's kept it together and figured out how to get everything done.
Yeah, you're right.
Maybe that's why I yelled at him.
I don't like being the one who screws up.
Exactly.
I couldn't handle feeling like a loser, so I was trying to make him feel like one.
You know what ?
I got to tell him I'm sorry.
And from now on, if he can be brave and keep it together,
I can be brave and keep it together.
Gracias.
You.
Gringo.
Off the bus.
But my apology and bravery would have to wait.
Oh, oh, not the 'stache, not the 'stache, not the 'stache.
'Cause Randy was so focused on getting back the woman he loved, he also didn't notice his brother getting kidnapped.
I would've yelled, "I'm sorry," but there's a time to apologize and there's a time to keep your mouth shut and hope that the two crazy Latino dudes with guns don't shoot you.
Uh, i-if you guys are gonna kill me, I have a brother that you might run into.
Could you please tell him I'm sorry for all the stuff I said, and that
I'm the one who ran over Crackers ?
Cr-Crackers was our cat.
I guess I can apologize to Crackers after you kill me.
He's here.
Wait till he sees we have a gringo here.
Turns out their boss, Diego, had a real strong feeling about America.
At least what he knew about it from TV before his satellite broke in 1988.
Hey, are those Bugle Boy jeans you're wearing ?
Catalina always talked about how scary and superstitious her village was.
While I was learning about the scary,
Randy was learning about the superstitious.
Excuse me, do you mind if I take those flowers and that sandwich ?
Normally I'd ask my brother if it was all right, but I don't know where he is.
No, please, take whatever.
Thanks.
I need 'em, 'cause I'm tracking down the love of my life, and the plane I was on didn't stop at Sky Mall.
Manuel !
Mi hijo !
Those things that you hold are from our shrine, dedicated to our son, Manuel, may he rest in peace.
The sandwich isn't what killed him, is it ?
No, it was a scooter.
The charity that dropped off toys that year didn't send helmets.
Whoever eats the sandwich from the sacred shrine now carries the soul of the deceased inside him.
As the keeper of our son's soul, you must come with us to our home so we can have one final evening with our son.
An evening we never had.
I'm sorry I swallowed your son.
I can throw him up if you want me to.
But right now I'm busy looking for my friend Catalina.
Catalina from America ?
You know her ?
Catalina with the beautiful olive skin and silky hair that drapes around her creamy shoulders and comes to rest on her first-class, ample bosoms...
Jesús ?
Yes, we know her.
And I will take you to her, if you will give us one more night with our son.
I'll be your son for the night.
But I have a white mom back in America, and she can never find out about this.
Back in home, Darnell was having trouble of his own.
His neighbors had parked their house too close, and well, Joy wouldn't do anything about it, 'cause her deaf lawyer put her on happy pills to control her anger.
Can we at least shut the window when they're running the dryer ?
I like it it feels like I'm being kissed by a thousand little bunnies.
Joy, I'm serious there's little pieces of clothes in my apple brown Betty.
Well, why don't you just take your little apple brown buns over there and tell 'em how you feel ?
I tried, but you know being in the Witness Protection Program makes me uneasy.
I don't like it when strangers ask too many questions.
I brought these for you, and I wanted to ask you a favor.
- Can you please...
- What are they ?
Uh, lemon squares.
Is that powdered sugar on top ?
- Yes.
- Did you make 'em yourself ?
My name is Darnell Turner, and that's all it's ever been.
I just hope they give us back our plate.
Oh, Darnell, just let 'em keep it.
What good is a plate if you can't share it with your neighbor ?
Joy, are you even in there ?
Ow !
I just got hit by a hot penny !
Diego liked my American jeans so much, he took them.
You're a drug dealer, aren't you ?
Uh, uh, no,
- I'm not even a drug user.
- So what are you, then, a roadie trying to score drugs for a rock band ?
I seen it all.
You tell Billy Idol he's not gonna get
- his white wedding from here.
- Look, I'm not a drug guy--
I'm just looking for my friend Catalina.
Catalina ?
What's her last name ?
I don't know, it's, uh, it's something Latin-ey.
Uh, it ends in "ez" or "illa."
Tortilla ?
You're here to help your friend Catalina Tortilla ?
Uh, that-that might not be it, but she is my friend.
Pretty, long, dark hair, uh, loves to dance, a lot of jumping.
Catalina.
Catalina's my-my niece !
Why didn't you say so ?
Jump around.
I'm the cream of the crop I rise to the top
I never eat a pig, 'cause a pig is a cop.
What a small world after all.
You're her friend, and Mario's her little brother.
Nice to meet you.
All right, we'll take you to see Catalina, but first we got to run a few errands.
Uh, th-they're not dangerous, are they ?
I've been involved in a lot of crimes in my life, but this was my first time as an unarmed hostage in a Third World country.
Oh, man, they weren't lying.
It was the wrong address.
Let's send them a ham.
Spiral-cut ?
Were you in there ?
Yes, spiral-cut.
I knew karma wanted me to find Catalina and bring her back, but I also knew it didn't want me to help murder some poor guy just 'cause he was late on his goat payment.
- I can't do this.
- Why not ?
He's a little guy, so you don't have to dig so deep.
I'm sorry, but I-I can't help you do bad stuff-- if I do, I got to put it on my list, and I don't want to get on another plane and come down here and make up for it.
Hey, list ?
What list ?
It's a list of everything bad I've done.
Getting Catalina deported's on there.
That's why I got to bring her back--
I got to cross her off.
And who made you write this list, your president, Señor Reagan ?
No one made me do it--
I did it on my own after I learned about karma.
So I took a shot and told Diego everything I knew about karma.
I told him about how I was trying to make up for all the bad things I've done one by one.
So you say you learned about karma on American TV, huh ?
That's when I knew I had him.
All right.
All right, I'll try it.
Even though you owe me a lot of money, I will no longer kill you.
Instead, the new Diego
- will kill your wife.
- No, no.
Your children.
Nope.
'Kay, what, then ?
How about a payment plan ?
I choose that one.
While I was making Diego understand karma,
Randy was trying to understand what it meant to be a dead son.
Did you enjoy the flan ?
You mean the yellow, slimy stuff I took one bite of and spit back out ?
It was okay.
So what now ?
You know.
I do ?
Come on, Manuel, it is the same as every night.
More flan ?
Tickle fiesta !
Stop !
I'm gonna pee !
Let yourself go, my son-- it's the third floor !
Seeing Catalina was gonna have to wait.
As bad as Diego was, there were worse bandidos in the area, and he had to keep watch and protect the village from them.
No, Alf was from the planet Melmac he's a alien.
I thought he was a monkey.
A monkey ?
No.
He ate cats.
Why would a monkey eat a cat ?
Your monkey ate my cat.
Fine, but at least my monkey wasn't sarcastic and cracking jokes all the time.
All that talk about monkeys at bedtime made me think of Randy.
I didn't know where he was, but I sure hoped he was okay.
Hey, Earl.
Yeah, Randy ?
Do you think when everybody dies they come back as a sandwich ?
I don't know, Randy, maybe.
After I die, if you ever see a peanut butter and baloney sandwich, eat it, because that's me.
Okay.
Earl ?
Yeah, Randy ?
Do you miss me ?
Yeah, Randy, I do.
I miss you, too, Earl.
Cold.
Sí, Mami.
Randy wasn't the only one having a hard time sleeping.
Darnell found the neighbors' motion detector hard to ignore.
The next morning, Diego finally brought me to Catalina's village.
I thought the villagers would be surprised to see a pant-less American, but they were more surprised to see a friendly Diego.
Buenos dias !
Ooh, tacos !
Uh, do you think I could get my wallet back ?
- Maybe-maybe with my pants ?
- Yeah, of course.
How rude of me.
You stay here, get some tacos.
I'll go get Catalina.
I was excited about getting my pants back.
Between the cold air and the giant mosquitoes,
I had missed them quite a bit, but then I saw something I had missed even more.
Randy !
Earl !
You're okay !
I'm okay.
Mami, Papi, this is my brother Earl.
Ah, my stepson !
Oh.
I ate the soul of a dead child, and if you see one laying around, grab it-- tastes just like a sandwich, and you get to have tickle fights and pee on the floor.
Sounds great, Randy.
Listen,
I was dragged off the bus before I got to tell you this, but
I'm sorry.
You're right, I was acting like a baby, and who am I to say you don't have a chance with Catalina ?
In fact, her uncle just went to get her.
What ?
I can't see her dressed like this.
You look cute.
I don't want to look cute, Mami, I want to look like a hero-- a big, sexy hero from America that came to save her.
Mi hijo...
Stay out of my life, Mami !
Teenagers.
Yeah, those are the rough years.
Thank you so much.
No problem.
And, again, sorry about farting on your lap, buddy.
It wasn't your fault.
Maria shouldn't have tickled you so hard.
Earl !
Catalina !
I can't believe you came all this way to get me.
Well, it was my fault you got sent down here in the first place.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
And yes, I will marry you !
What ?
When my uncle told me that you will marry me so I could get my green card, I couldn't believe it.
He told you that ?
What ?
I'm sorry, did you want it to be a surprise ?
No, it still feels like a surprise.
You are a true friend, Earl.
Thank you so, so much.
I didn't know how I was gonna get back.
Aw... it's beautiful, it's beautiful.
You mess things up, you fix it-- it's karma.
Look at that.
I'm proud to have worn your pants for 14 hours.
Randy !
I am so happy !
Me, too !
Are you going to be the best man ?
The best I can be.
No, Earl's best man at the wedding.
Who's Earl marrying ?
Me, silly.
Isn't it amazing ?
He is my hero.
While Catalina and Diego were out preparing my third unplanned wedding, I was trying to find Randy, whose feelings I'd accidentally hurt... again.
Randy !
Randy !
Look, Randy, it wasn't my fault.
Diego thought that was the plan.
She's my friend.
What was I supposed to do ?
Oh, yeah ?
Well, if you like her so much, why don't you marry her ?
Oh, wait.
You are.
Walk with me, Pedro.
Look, it all happened too fast, Randy.
She was so happy, she started hugging me.
She was supposed to be hugging me.
This was my chance to be a hero and you stole it.
Randy, you can still be the hero.
We'll switch and you can be
- the one who marries her.
- No !
For me to have a chance, it needed to be perfect, Earl.
I needed to come in, save the day and sweep her off her feet.
Now I'm just gonna look pathetic and weird and I don't want to look pathetic and weird.
Come on, Pedro.
In Spanish, in Spanish, in Spanish...
While I tried to find a way to get through to Randy,
Darnell was just trying to get through the day.
Hey, Tina, how much if I can get this cupcake in the trashcan from here ?
Five bucks says you miss.
I'll split that cupcake with you, cupcake.
Joy, I need the old you back !
I'm yin, you're yang.
Yin is nice, yang's a bitch !
This house doesn't work without yang !
Nothing Darnell said could snap Joy out of her drug-induced happiness.
But something eventually did.
Beer can !
Oh, snapety, snap, snap, snap.
Excuse me.
We haven't officially met, but I'm Joy Turner from the trailer next door.
I passed you those bleach wipes for your fanny hole.
I hope you didn't take any skin off.
A little.
Good.
Listen, now, I know on the outside
I look like a real sweetie sweetheart, but trust me, on the inside I'm 100% bitch.
I even have a T-shirt that says it.
I got it for a Mother's Day present.
Anyway, here's the thing.
My lawyer's got me taking these happy pills to control my anger, but since you just used my baby boy's head as a backboard for your little trashcan basketball game,
I'm gonna stop taking 'em and come back in three days when the happy wears off.
Look at that.
A real tree.
Mm !
I love the smell of it.
Love it !
Anyhoo, when these pills wear off,
I don't know exactly what's gonna happen, but I imagine it'll involve this beer can breaking out your teeth, your wife screaming at me to stop kicking you and your children crying after they see what I've done to your face.
Heck, I might even rip off one of your ears and make it into a little coin purse.
Okay, then, so I'll be back in three days to give you that Christmas ass-kickin' I promised unless you decide that now would be a good time to move this trailer.
It's a good time to move our trailer.
Oh, that is fantastic news.
And I'm sorry, but that little Santa over there shaking his tushy is absolutely adorable.
Take him.
Really ?
Even though this was just a green-card wedding,
Catalina's village still followed all the town's traditions.
You see, this symbolizes how beautiful and admired a bride should be.
And that's to remind her not to get too full of herself.
- Seems weird.
- Oh, yeah ?
And throwing rice at people makes a lot of sense, huh ?
Wait till you see what you have to do.
In our little village, before a man is allowed to marry a woman, he has to pass three simple tests.
The first is to cross this beam without falling.
Sure, that makes sense.
Uh, excuse me a second.
I need to borrow my brother's shoes.
They have better traction for crossing beams.
What are you doing ?
Just switch shoes with me and listen.
Randy, this is your chance to be a hero.
All I have to do is fail the test and you can step in and save the day.
That's a great idea, Earl.
And then after this, let's never travel again.
All right, now that you got the proper footwear,
I can tell you that this plank represents the straight and narrow path that you as a husband must follow.
Okay, bring on the leeches !
The what ?
Leeches.
They represent, I don't know, hookers and stuff.
Just don't fall in.
Hit it.
I really wanted to stay up on that plank and away from those leeches a whole lot, but not as much as I wanted Randy to be happy.
Damn it.
Whoa !
Whoa-oa, whoa-oa !
Whoopsy daisy !
Leeches sucking my face !
Leeches sucking my face !
That's okay.
I can...
No, wait, wait.
Earl, you know what ?
The old me would have said "One and done," right ?
But karma says, "Two out of three."
To the hot coals !
To give Randy his shot, I planned on stepping on the hot coals, and then stepping right back off.
What I didn't plan on was how hard it is to change direction on hot coals.
It burned like hell, but at least
Randy was gonna be able to step in and be the hero.
I'm sorry, Catalina, but I guess I'm just not...
Earl, this is your lucky day.
One out of three ?
To the field of rakes !
Diego said something about the field of rakes representing the careful dance of talking about your wife's weight.
But for me, it represented the last chance to help Randy.
Okay, that's it.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Catalina.
I gave him several chances and he just keeps proving himself not worthy.
But how am I supposed to get back to America ?
Catalina ?
Can I try and marry you ?
You would do that ?
To the pit of leeches !
I was a little worried about Randy walking on that thin plank, 'cause I had seen him fall off sidewalks before, but if it meant rescuing Catalina, he could have danced on the head of a pin.
Yeah !
And watching Randy cross those hot coals,
I realized he probably wouldn't have failed gym class if Catalina had gone to our high school.
Everything was going great for Randy.
And even when it didn't go great, nothing stopped him.
I did it !
I did it !
And in return for his sacrifice, Randy got to marry the woman he loved.
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You're a good friend.
He thought about telling his new wife that he loved her, but he didn't want to risk ruining his wedding day.
Thanks for letting me be the hero.
You been the hero all along, Randy.
I was just getting in your way.
That's so she doesn't get too full of herself.
Oh.
Yep, it was successful trip.
I was feeling happy, and not just 'cause of my airplane pills.
I was happy 'cause I helped bring Catalina back home and
I helped get Randy closer to the woman he loved.
And I taught a bad guy about being good.
What happened ?
Who took your pants ?
Oh, man, that's my thing.
The same banditos who chopped off Mario's fingers.
This time they cut off his tongue.
They cut out your tongue ?
I don't wanna talk about it.
How dare they do this to my nephew in my village.
They said because they heard you were nice now, the could do as they please.
Oh, did they ?
Okay.
Well, forget karma.
New rule.
Do bad things and Diego happens.
Wolverine !
Transcript :
Raceman
Synchro :
Dingo
[Earl Narrating] Me and Randy were about to take our very first airplane ride.
Since we aren't big travelers, we weren't sure what to pack, so we packed everything.
We weren't goin'on vacation though.
We were goin'to take care of the most recent item on my list- got Catalina kicked out of America.
- You see, recently I was on a winning'streak, gambling'.
- Yeah, Tito!
- No matter what I bet on-
- Yeah, buddy!
- I just couldn't lose.
- You can't lose, Earl.
But I got so caught up in gambling'...
I forced Catalina to drive without a license and get pulled over.
She was too worried about her boobs escapin' to make an escape ofher own-
- Let go of me!
- And she was deported.
You have to believe me, I am an American.
McDonald's.
Disneyland.
Jim Belushi!
[Earl Narrating] And because of me, Randy lost his chance... to finally tell Catalina how he felt about her.
You think Catalina's been robbed, or murdered, or gone out on a date?
Any of those would be my worst nightmare.
But if I had to pick one, I guess I hope she gets robbed.
We'll keep our fingers crossed, Randy, but I wouldn't worry.
I mean, it's her own country.
She's gotta have friends down there.
# [Man Singing In Spanish]
How come you always get to be the Bandit?
'Cause when you're the Bandit, you always cave in... when the women cry and beg for the lives of their children.
Plus, I have the mustache.
- My mother could be the Bandit.
- Shut up, cleaning lady.
# [Continues]
- Lots to do today on my list.
- You and your stupid list.
Número ochenta y seis:
Steal the donkey from a one-legged girl.
You tip over the girl, I'll get the donkey.
My name is Earl.
[Earl Narrating] Since the drawstring handles on Randy's luggage had already broken... and I didn't want the same thing to happen to mine... we decided to get a proper suitcase.
Unfortunately, my ex-wife still had mine.
Listen, Joy, I need to get that suitcase my dad gave me for my 18th birthday.
We don't have time, so I don't want to fight about it.
Lemonade?
It's pink flavor.
- What'd you do to it?
- Oh, sweetie pants.
The world is filled with sunshine and pink lemonade if you just learn to trust people.
I'll get the suitcase.
Oh, and, Randy, I made a gingerbread house this morning.
You can nibble on the roof if you want.
- Hey, fellas.
- Hey, Crabman.
What's up with Joy?
Her lady lawyer put her on some prescription medication... to make sure she doesn't lose her temper in court.
You know how sometimes people say, "Take a chill pill"?
Joy did.
I wish she was taking those pills back when you were married to her.
Me too.
All she ever took back then was cough syrup and strawberry wine.
It made her horny for 10 minutes, then she'd just get pissed.
If I wasn't quick enough in bed, I'd get punched in the junk.
Yeah, when it gets towards nine minutes, I try to get behind her.
## [Whistling]
Is that George Clooney standing' in my livin' room?
Randy, your hair looks great.
Are you doin' somethin' different, like the movie stars do?
I slept on my left side instead of my right.
And then in the morning, it was itchy back here, so I did this.
Hmm.
Well, it is workin' for you, sugar butt.
I tell ya, if there was a Perfect 10 magazine for ex-brother-in-laws...
I'd put you on the cover.
- Suitcase!
Suitcase.
- [Claps Hands]
Man, those are some powerful pills.
Yeah.
Unfortunately, Mr. Turtle got ahold of one.
I have to keep flipping him.
[Earl Narrating] We finally made it to the airport.
And it turns out airport people ask a lot more questions than bus people.
- How many individuals are flying?
- Two.
- When would you like to depart?
- Well, whenever's good for the pilot.
I mean, we're ready to go now, but whenever the pilot's ready to go.
[Woman On P.A.] TransGlobal Flight 53-
- Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat?
- I want a chair seat.
Either one's fine.
- Passports?
- Past sports?
Hmm.
Uh, played a little baseball and some soccer as a kid-
No, sir, to leave the country, you both need passports.
- Identification.
- Oh, passports.
I think you only need those if you're a foreigner.
We're American.
[Earl Narrating] Turns out even Americans need passports.
So we went to the passport office... where we filled out a few forms and got our pictures taken.
[Shutter Clicking, Bulb Popping]
And they only had one requirement when you get your picture taken:
You had to keep your eyes open... which I could never seem to do.
- Come on, Earl.
- I'm tryin', Randy.
[Exhales]
[Earl Narrating] Then Randy had an idea.
Perfect.
Hmm.
Your eyes are brown.
They look green in this picture.
Uh, yeah, l-I recently had a double eye transplant.
They're from a pig.
Uh, they tried to find one with green eyes, but... well, unfortunately, they save those for famous people.
Okeydokey.
[Earl Narrating] While me and Randy were havin'trouble gettin'to Catalina's village... she was havin'trouble gettin'used to life back at home.
- Why are you taping that old lady to a chair?
- I kidnapped my friend's mother.
He's sick of living with her, so I'm going to make her smoke cigarettes until she dies.
This is the cruelest, most unjustified kidnapping I have ever seen.
- How many have you seen?
- Six or so.
Hmm.
- [Man On P.A.] Please do not leave luggage unattended.
- [Man] All right, sir.
Why is everyone taking' their shoes off?
They have to make sure there aren't explosives in them.
- Explosives?
- Yeah.
It's happened.
- Hey!
- Whew.
Sir, come with me, please.
Hey, Earl, throw your shoes.
If they don't blow up, you get to go to the front of the line.
[Guard] Wait, sir.
[Earl Narrating] The good thing about goin'your whole life... without ever having flown on an airplane... is everything is new to you.
Hey, Earl.
Sky Mall!
There's a mall in the sky.
If this plane stops there, I want to get Catalina one of these hot dog cookers... that cooks the buns and the wieners at the same time.
It doesn't say it's the perfect gift for the love of your life, but obviously it is.
[Earl Narrating] I'd always wondered how a big airplane like this could fly.
Turns out the ushers had their doubts too.
In the event of an emergency evacuation... please calmly make your way to the emergency exit nearest you.
Also make sure all carry-on items are stowed securely.
Damn.
[Clears Throat]
Uh, sorry to bother you, sir, but it seems that our row... is exactly in the middle of the two emergency exits.
So, uh, we should decide now... who should go to the front and who should go to the back if we have to get out of here.
Sure.
We'll go to the front.
- [Clears Throat] Uh, listen, is-is-is-
- We'll go to the back.
Good, 'cause I already had it in my head that way.
And you'll tell her, right?
[Flight Attendant] Cell phones and laptops.
And in the event of an emergency water landing... your seat may be used as a floatation device.
Um, excuse me, ma'am.
You
- You just said my seat "may be" used as a floatation device.
Is that "may be" as in "can be"... or "maybe," like "maybe yours will or maybe yours won't"?
'Cause I didn't ask for a floating' seat.
- L
- I would have, but that wasn't one of the choices.
- All the seats float, sir.
And if there's a crash on land, will these seat cushions break our fall?
Earl, be quiet.
You're gonna get us thrown out.
And in the event that the cabin loses pressure, oxygen masks will fall from the ceiling.
Uh, that's it.
No, thank you.
- This is my stop.
- Earl!
You might try sprinkling' in a few stories about what happens... in the event the plane doesn't crash.
[Earl Narrating] Since it turned out planes scare the crap outta me...
I was lookin'into other ways of gettin'to Catalina.
We can take a bus for the first 13 days, then it looks like it's all donkey from there.
- Donkeys can swim, right?
- Hey, you guys back from Catalina's already?
We didn't go.
Someone was afraid to fly.
Someone whose name rhymes with "girl," as in sissy girl who wears flannel shirts.
Do you still need more hints?
Because it's Earl.
Look, I just don't understand how something' that big can stay in the air.
- Wings don't even flap.
- Earl, it's okay to be afraid.
Fear is just your feelings asking' for a hug.
- I like the new Joy.
- I don't.
I mean, I still enjoy her old hotness, but newJoy doesn't have any fight in her.
Those pills make her like...
Finland.
I didn't fall in love with Finland, Earl.
[Earl Narrating] There was a reason Darnell was missin'Joy's fight.
Their new neighbors wanted a bigger front yard... so they parked their double-wide closer toJoy and Darnell.
- Honey, we're outta toilet paper.
- [Earl Narrating] Too close.
Well, go to the store and get some!
I can't really do that right now!
Well, neither can I. I'm paintin' the coffee stains outta the mugs.
Aren't you gonna do somethin'?
Of course I am.
Here you go, sweetheart.
Be careful.
They have bleach in 'em, so they might burn a little.
[Bell Dings]
Hey, wait.
If there's a pill that can makeJoy not mean...
I bet there's a pill that can make you not a sissy.
Maybe I can break it up and put it in your applesauce.
Maybe I can break it up and put it in your applesauce.
Shoot, why'd I tell you that?
I know.
I'll just squish it in a banana.
Damn it, I did it again.
Now I'm runnin' outta fruits.
Randy, I can swallow a pill whole.
No, I want to sneak it to you in somethin'.
I hope the pill is small, because I know how you love blueberries.
Crap!
[Earl Narrating] So to get the pills, we went to the only doctor we knew.
So Earl, Randy, uh... says here that I haven't seen you boys since you were 10.
Well, you know, you get busy.
I haven't been seein' another doctor, if that's what you're worried about.
Do you still give out lollipops?
On the way out, if you're good.
So, Earl, I see you have some anxiety about flying.
Well, actually more about crashing'.
Crashin' and dyin'.
I can write you up a prescription for a sedative that should help you.
Now, since you're going to Latin America, I assume you've had your inoculations.
Here we go with the upsell.
Come on now.
You want to make sure you don't get any diseases.
- I'll just give you one shot.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, thank you, Doc.
I don't like needles.
I'll just get whatever diseases they have down there.
I'm fine with that.
Just get the shot, Earl.
Don't be a wuss.
I'm not a wuss, Randy.
I just don't think I need-
Oop!
That's a sharp one.
Earl, the love of my life is down there.
Plus, she's on your list.
You gotta do this.
Why do I have to get the shot?
They got the diseases down there.
How come they all can't get shots?
Fine.
Do whatever you want.
I'm sorry, Randy.
I just think there's other ways we can-
[Screams] Son of a bitch!
How did I not see that comin'?
[Earl Narrating] So I took the pills... and me and Randy headed back to the airport to get on the plane.
- But I was already flying'.
- Whoo!
Check it!
[Earl Narrating] Yeah, these pills were somethin'else.
I liked 'em.
And as the plane was about to take off...
I left the wild riding'-the-suitcase-while- screamin'-at-strangers phase... and entered the calm sleeping'-in-my-seat- and-droolin'-on-my-shirt phase.
- Man, those pills are great.
- Yeah, you've been asleep for hours.
I know.
They knocked me out just before we took off and wore off right after we landed.
- That's the way to fly, Randy.
- Oh, we haven't flown yet.
- But you just said I was out for hours.
- You were.
But we've been sittin' on the runway the whole time.
- Somethin' about mechanical difficulties.
- Mechanical difficulties?
Yeah, there was a bright flash, and I heard somebody scream.
They gave us animal crackers.
I ate yours.
Randy?
I think we're takin' off now.
They probably fixed it.
Give me the pills, Randy.
I need more pills.
They're in the suitcase, and the lady said it was under the plane.
But every time I open the door lookin' for the stairs, all I find is a teeny tiny bathroom.
Let me off!
Stop the plane!
Back it up!
No!
Earl, you're not supposed to stand up during takeoff.
Those ladies did a whole play about it.
- Earl!
- Hold it!
Sir, we're in the air.
I can't let you off the plane this time.
I'll let myself off.
I know where the emergency exits are.
Sir, don't make me do this.
[Screams]
- [Grunts]
- Ouch!
Get the straps!
We've got a biter!
[Earl Narrating] While I was strugglin' because I couldn't take my pills...
Darnell was strugglin' 'causeJoy was still taking hers.
[Phone Ringing]
- Telephone!
- What?
- Telephone!
- Let the machine pick it up!
[Answering Machine Clicks]
[Man, Woman] You've reached David and Tina Hays.
Leave a message.
Ciao.
- [Answering Machine Beeps] - [Woman On Phone] Hello?
Hello?
It's your grandmother.
Are you home?
Pick up.!
I wanted to check on Christmas plans.
I could come there, but you'd have to come pick me up.
I could get Lucille to drive me, unless you're serving alcohol.
Are you serving alcohol?
If you are, I can't have Lucille drive me... because that drive home on Thanksgiving was terrifying.
- Are you gonna do something about this?
- Terrifying, I tell you.
- I guess I'll have to.
- It was horrible.!
And is your husband's brother going to be there?
Ryan, is it?
He is just-
Hello, people next door's grandma.
Don't worry about a thing.
We'll pick you up and bring you over for Christmas.
You're gonna have to do it though.
I'm not supposed to drive on these pills.
[Earl Narrating] After bein'tied up on an airplane for eight hours...
I was happy to walk on solid ground.
Which was good, 'cause we had about two miles of it on the way to the bus station.
Catalina's village is a five hour bus ride... and we have to get on the bus now 'cause it's leavin' soon.
Okay.
I just gotta get somethin' to eat first.
- No, Earl, we don't have time.
- But there's tacos, Randy.
You know how I feel about tacos.
It's the only food shaped like a smile.
A beef smile.
I'm goin'.
No, Earl.
There won't be another bus goin' to Catalina's village until tomorrow... so we have to get on that one.
- We can eat when we get there.
- That's easy for you to say.
You got to eat on the plane.
[Muffled] Put it down!
I'm sorry, Randy.
I gotta get somethin' to eat.
No, Earl, I can't let you do that.
Um, I wasn't askin' for your permission, Randy.
Um, I wasn't askin' if you were askin', Earl.
- We're not missin' that bus just so you can get a taco.
- You're right, Randy.
I'm gonna get two tacos and maybe some of that freaky white soda they got.
- Uh, excuse-o, por favor.
- Ande.
Uh, is this the end-o of the line?
[Grunts]
[Both Grunting]
# [Man Singing In Spanish]
[Shouts] Let go, Randy!
- Not until you get on the bus!
- [Grunts]
# [Singing In Spanish Continues]
- Quit dragging your feet, Earl.
This'll go a lot easier.
- I want a taco!
[Screams] You bit me!
- Sorry, Randy.
It had to be done.
- Fine!
I give up.
You can have your stupid taco.
When we get to Catalina's village!
- Let go!
- No!
- You're splitting' me!
- Then put me down!
- No!
- [Grunts]
Randy, I'm gettin' a taco!
[Screams] Damn it, Randy!
Now I'm hungry and blind!
You're being such a baby!
You've been complaining' the whole trip.
"Waah, waah, waah.
I'm afraid to fly.
I don't like needles.
I'm hungry and blind."
- Sorry, senor.
- Ow!
You hungry, baby?
You want a bottle?
Here.
Have your bottle, baby.
- Randy, stop it!
Randy, stop it!
- [Baby Crying]
- No.
Have your bottle, baby.
- Randy, I'm serious.
- If you don't let go, I'm gonna kill you, I swear!
- Have your bottle, baby.
- That's gross!
- We're gettin' on the bus.
I want my taco!
Ow!
Not the 'stache!
Not the 'stache!
- Not the 'stache!
Not the 'stache!
- Drive.
- Don't drive!
- Drive!
- Why you bein' such a jerk?
- You're the one being the jerk.
You got Catalina deported... and now you're about to let some stupid taco cost me the love of my life!
Here we go again.
The love of your life.
- Like you really have a chance with her.
- [Passengers] Aww!
[Muttering In Spanish]
He started it.
I know the word on the bus is I'm the jerk... but there was a whole lot of stuff that happened outside.
Is my mustache even?
'Cause that's somethin' he did.
He yanked on it.
No, thanks.
You know what?
Actually, I'm starvin'.
I think I will take a bite.
Thank you.
Mmm.
Looks like a Slim Jim, tastes like a doughnut.
That's brilliant.
Can't believe you guys are so poor.
[Speaking Spanish]
[Speaking Spanish]
Oh, this is gonna be great.
My brother's freaked out by birds.
[Earl Narrating] Randy's been terrified ofbirds his whole life.
- [Clucking]
- Little ones, big ones.
Even those talking'ones people keep as pets.
Hey, Earl, did you see what that stupid bird- [Screams]
You know how when you let go of the end of a balloon... and it goes flyin' around the room makin' a squealy noise?
Well, you're about to see a grown man do the same thing.
[Earl Narrating] So I sat back and waited... for the Randy balloon to start flyin'.
- [Chicken Clucking]
- But it never did.
He was sittin'face to beak with an upside down chicken... and he didn't even flinch.
He was so focused on gettin'back the woman he loved, he wasn't scared of anything.
Not the bird, not the shots, not the airplane... not even kicking'my ass.
That's when I realized, if Randy's love for Catalina was that strong... he could make anything possible.
So who was I to say he didn't have a chance?
You know what?
He was right.
I have been a baby and a screwup.
He's been the one that's kept it together and figured out how to get everything done.
[Speaking Spanish]
Yeah, you're right.
Maybe that's why I yelled at him.
I don't like bein' the one who screws up.
[Spanish]
Exactly.
I couldn't handle feelin' like a loser, so I was tryin' to make him feel like one.
You know what?
I gotta tell him I'm sorry.
And from now on, if he can be brave and keep it together...
I can be brave and keep it together.
Gracias.
[Spanish]
You, gringo, off the bus.
[Earl Narrating] But my apology and bravery would have to wait.
Oh!
Not the 'stache!
Not the 'stache!
Not the 'stache!
[Earl Narrating] 'Cause Randy was so focused on gettin'back the woman he loved... he also didn't notice his brother gettin'kidnapped.
I would've yelled "I'm sorry"... but there's a time to apologize and there's a time to keep your mouth shut... and hope that the two crazy Latino dudes with guns don't shoot you.
Uh, if you guys are gonna kill me, I have a brother that you might run into.
Could you please tell him I'm sorry for all the stuff I said... and that I'm the one who ran over Crackers?
Crackers was our cat.
I guess I can apologize to Crackers after you kill me.
- [Horn Honking]
- He's here.
Wait till he sees we have a gringo here.
[Honking Continues]
[Earl Narrating] Turns out their boss, Diego, had a real strong feeling about America.
At least what he knew about it from TV before his satellite broke... in 1988.
Hey.
Are those Bugle Boy jeans you're wearing?
[Earl] Catalina always talked about how scary and superstitious her village was.
While I was learnin'about the scary, Randy was learnin'about the superstitious.
Excuse me.
You mind if I take those flowers and that sandwich?
Normally, I'd ask my brother if it was all right, but I don't know where he is.
No, please.
Take whatever.
Thanks.
I need 'em 'cause I'm tracking down the love of my life... and the plane I was on didn't stop at Sky Mall.
Manuel. ¡Mi hijo.!
Those things that you hold are from our shrine... dedicated to our son, Manuel, may he rest in peace.
The sandwich isn't what killed him, is it?
No, it was a scooter.
The charity that dropped off toys that year didn't send helmets.
Whoever eats the sandwich from the sacred shrine... now carries the soul of the deceased inside him.
As the keeper of our son's soul... you must come with us to our home so we can have one final evening with our son... an evening we never had.
I'm sorry I swallowed your son.
I can throw him up, if you want me to.
But right now I'm busy lookin' for my friend Catalina.
Catalina from America?
You know her?
Catalina with the beautiful olive skin... and silky hair that drapes around her creamy shoulders... and comes to rest on her first-class ample bosoms.
Jesus!
Yes, we know her.
And I will take you to her... if you will give us one more night with our son.
I'll be your son for the night.
But I have a white mom back in America, and she can never find out about this.
[Earl Narrating] Back at home, Darnell was havin'trouble ofhis own.
His neighbors had parked their house too close... and, well, Joy wouldn't do anything about it... 'cause her deaflawyer put her on happy pills to control her anger.
Can we at least shut the window when they're running the dryer?
I like it.
Feels like I'm bein' kissed by a thousand little bunnies.
Joy, I'm serious.
There's little pieces of clothes in my apple brown betty.
Why don't you just take your little apple brown buns there and tell 'em how you feel?
I tried.
But you know being' in the Witness Protection Program makes me uneasy.
I don't like it when strangers ask too many questions.
[Spits]
I brought these for you, and I wanted to ask you a favor.
Can you please-
- What are they?
- Lemon squares.
- Is that powdered sugar on top?
- Yes.
Did you make 'em yourself?
My name is Darnell Turner, and that's all it's ever been.
I just hope they give us back our plate.
Oh, Darnell, just let 'em keep it.
What good is a plate if you can't share it with your neighbor?
Joy, are you even in there?
[Rattling]
Ow!
I just got hit by a hot penny.
[Earl Narrating] Diego liked my American jeans so much, he took 'em.
You're a drug dealer, aren't you?
- Uh, no, I'm not even a drug user.
- So what are you then?
A roadie tryin' to score drugs for a rock band?
I seen it all.
You tell Billy Idol he's not gonna get his white wedding from here.
Look, I'm not a drug guy.
I'm just lookin' for my friend Catalina.
Catalina?
What's her last name?
Uh, I don't know.
It's, uh- It's somethin' Latin-y.
Uh, it ends in "ez" or "illa." Tortilla?
You're here to help your friend Catalina Tortilla?
Uh, th-that might not be it, but she is my friend.
Pretty, long dark hair.
Uh, loves to dance.
- A lot of jumping'.
- Catalina!
Catalina's my niece.
Why didn't you say so?
## [Rapping]
[Snapping Fingers]
What a small world after all.
- You're her friend, and Mario's her little brother.
- Nice to meet you.
All right.
We'll take you to see Catalina.
First, we gotta run a few errands.
Uh, they're not dangerous, are they?
- [Gunshots] - [Woman Screaming]
[Gunshots Continue]
- [Gunshots] - [Man Shouts]
[Earl Narrating] I've been involved in a lot of crimes in my life... but this was my first time as an unarmed hostage in a third world country.
[Man Shouting In Spanish]
Oh, man, they weren't lying.
It was the wrong address.
- Let's send them a ham.
- Spiral cut?
Were you in there?
Yes, spiral cut.
[Earl Narrating] I knew karma wanted me to find Catalina and bring her back... but I also knew it didn't want me to help murder some poor guy...
- just 'cause he was late on his goat payments.
- I can't do this.
Why not?
He's a little guy, so you don't have to dig so deep.
I'm sorry, but I can't help you do bad stuff.
If I do, I gotta put it on my list... and I don't want to get on another plane and come down here and make up for it.
Hey, list-What list?
It's a list of everything bad I've done.
Gettin' Catalina deported's on there.
That's why I gotta bring her back.
I gotta cross her off.
And who made you write this list?
Your president, Señor Reagan?
No one made me do it.
I did it on my own, after I learned about karma.
[Earl Narrating] So I took a shot and told Diego everything I knew about karma.
I told him about how I was tryin'to make up... for all the bad things I've done, one by one.
So you say you learned about karma on American TV, huh?
[Earl Narrating] That's when I knew I had him.
All right.
All right, I'll try it.
Even though you owe me a lot of money, I will no longer kill you.
- Instead, the new Diego will kill your wife.
- No, no!
- Your children.
- Nope.
- Okay, what then?
- How about a payment plan?
I choose that one.
[Earl Narrating] While I was making Diego understand karma...
Randy was trying to understand what it meant to be a dead son.
Did you enjoy the flan?
You mean the yellow slimy stuff I took one bite of and spit back out?
It was okay.
- So what now?
- You know.
- I do?
- Come on, Manuel.
- It is the same as every night.
- More flan?
Tickle fiesta!
[Giggling]
Stop!
I'm gonna pee!
Let yourself go, my son.
It's a dirt floor.
[Earl Narrating] Seein'Catalina was gonna have to wait.
As bad as Diego was, there were worse bandidos in the area... and he had to keep watch and protect the village from 'em.
No, ALF was from the planet Melmac.
He's an alien.
- I thought he was a monkey.
- A monkey?
No, he ate cats.
- Why would a monkey eat a cat?
- Your monkey ate my cat.
Fine.
But at least my monkey wasn't sarcastic and cracking jokes all the time.
[Earl Narrating] All that talk about monkeys at bedtime made me think of Randy.
I didn't know where he was, but I sure hoped he was okay.
Hey, Earl.
Yeah, Randy?
Do you think when everybody dies, they come back as a sandwich?
I don't know, Randy.
Maybe.
After I die, if you ever see a peanut butter and bologna sandwich... eat it, because that's me.
Okay.
Earl?
Yeah, Randy?
Do you miss me?
Yeah, Randy, I do.
I miss you too, Earl.
- Cold?
- Sí, mami.
[Earl Narrating] Randy wasn't the only one having'a hard time sleepin'.
Darnell found the neighbors' motion detector hard to ignore.
[Electrical Buzzing]
[Earl Narrating] The next morning, Diego finally brought me to Catalina's village.
I thought the villagers would be surprised to see a pantless American... but they were more surprised to see a friendly Diego.
- ¡Buenos días.!
- [Woman Screaming]
[Man Shouting In Spanish]
Ooh, tacos.
Uh, do you think I can get my wallet back?
Uh, maybe- maybe with my pants?
Yeah, of course.
How rude of me.
You stay here, get some tacos.
I'll go get Catalina.
[Zipper Unzipping]
[Earl Narrating] I was excited about gettin'my pants back.
Between the cold air and the giant mosquitoes, I had missed them quite a bit.
But then I saw somethin' I had missed even more.
- Randy!
- Earl!
- You're okay!
- I'm okay.
- Mami, papi, this is my brother, Earl.
- Ah, my stepson.
Oh, I ate the soul of their dead child.
If you see one laying' around, grab it.
Tastes just like a sandwich, and you get to have tickle fights and pee on the floor.
Sounds great, Randy.
I was dragged off the bus before I got to tell you this, but I'm sorry.
You're right.
L-I was actin' like a baby.
Who am I to say you don't have a chance with Catalina?
In fact, her uncle just went to get her.
What?
I can't see her dressed like this.
- You look cute.
- I don't want to look cute, mami.
I want to look like a hero.
A big, sexy hero from America that came to save her.
- Mi hijo.
- Stay out of my life, mami.!
- Teenagers.
- Yeah, those are the rough years.
Thank you so much.
No problem.
And again, sorry about farting' on your lap, buddy.
It wasn't your fault.
Maria shouldn't have tickled you so hard.
- Earl.!
- Catalina!
I can't believe you came all this way to get me.
Well, it was my fault you got sent down here in the first place.
- I forgive you.
I forgive you.
And yes, I will marry you!
- What?
When my uncle told me you will marry me so I could get my green card, I couldn't believe it.
- He told you that?
- What?
I'm sorry.
Did you want it to be a surprise?
No, it still feels like a surprise.
You are a true friend, Earl.
Thank you so, so much.
- I didn't know how I was gonna get back.
- Aww.
It's beautiful.
It's beautiful.
You mess things up, you fix it.
It's karma.
Look at that.
I'm proud to have worn your pants for 14 hours.
Randy!
[Laughing]
- I am so happy!
- Me too.
- Are you gonna be the best man?
- Best I can be.
No, Earl's best man, at the wedding.
Who's Earl marrying?
Me, silly.
Isn't it amazing?
He is my hero.
[Grunts]
[Earl] While Catalina and Diego were off preparing'my third unplanned wedding...
I was tryin'to find Randy, whose feelings I'd accidentally hurt... again.
Randy?
Randy!
# [Man Singing In Spanish]
[Exhales]
Look, Randy, it wasn't my fault.
Diego thought that was the plan.
She's my friend.
What was I supposed to do?
Oh, yeah?
Well, if you like her so much, why don't you marry her?
Oh, wait, you are.
Walk with me, Pedro.
Look, it all happened too fast, Randy.
She was so happy, she started hugging' me.
She was supposed to be huggin' me.
This was my chance to be a hero, and you stole it.
Randy, you-you can still be the hero.
We'll switch, and you can be the one who marries her.
No!
For me to have a chance, it needed to be perfect, Earl.
I needed to come in, save the day and sweep her off her feet.
Now I'm just gonna look pathetic and weird... and I don't want to look pathetic and weird.
- Come on, Pedro.

[Earl Narrating] While I tried to find a way to get through to Randy...
Darnell was just tryin' to get through the day.
Tina, how much if I can get this cupcake in the trash can from here?
Five bucks says you miss.
I'll split that cupcake with you, cupcake.
Joy, I need the old you back!
I'm yin, you're yang.
Yin is nice, yang's a bitch!
This house doesn't work without yang!
[Earl Narrating] Nothin'Darnell said could snapJoy out ofher drug-induced happiness.
- But somethin'eventually did.
- Beer can!
Oh, snappity-snap-snap-snap!
Excuse me.
We haven't officially met, but I'm Joy Turner from the trailer next door.
I passed you those bleach wipes for your fanny hole.
- Hope it didn't take any skin off.
- A little.
Good.
Listen, now I know on the outside I look like a real sweetie sweetheart... but trust me, on the inside I'm a hundred percent bitch.
I even have a T-shirt that says it.
Got it for a Mother's Day present.
Anyway, here's the thing.
My lawyer's got me takin' these happy pills to control my anger.
But since you just used my baby boy's head as a backboard... for your little trash can basketball game...
I'm gonna stop taking 'em and come back in three days when the happy wears off.
[Gasps] Look at that!
A real tree.
[Laughing]
[Sniffs] Mmm!
I love the smell of it.
- [Sniffs] Love it!
- [Nervous Chuckle]
Anyhoo, when these pills wear off, I don't know exactly what's gonna happen... but I imagine it'll involve this beer can breaking' out your teeth... your wife screaming' at me to stop kickin' you... and your children cryin' after they see what I've done to your face.
Heck, I might even rip off one of your ears and make it into a little coin purse.
Okay, then, so I'll be back in three days... to give you that Christmas ass-kickin' I promised... unless you decide that now would be a good time to move this trailer.
- It's a good time to move our trailer.
- Oh, that is fantastic news.
And I'm sorry, but that little Santa over there shakin'his tushy is absolutely adorable.
Uh, take him.
Really?
# [Chorus Singing]
[Giggling]
[Earl Narrating] Even though this was just a green card wedding...
Catalina's village still followed all the town's traditions.
You see, this symbolizes how beautiful and admired a bride should be.
- [Yelps] - [Crowd Cheering]
- And that's to remind her not to get too full of herself.
- Seems weird.
Oh, yeah?
And throwing rice at people makes a lot of sense, huh?
Wait till you see what you have to do.
In our little village, before a man is allowed to marry a woman... he has to pass three simple tests.
- The first is to cross this beam without falling.
- Sure, that makes sense.
Uh, excuse me a second.
I need to borrow my brother's shoes.
They have better traction for crossing' beams.
- What are you doin'?
- Just switch shoes with me and listen.
Randy, this is your chance to be a hero.
All I have to do is fail the test, then you can save the day.
That's a great idea, Earl.
And then after this, let's never travel again.
All righty, now that you got the proper footwear...
I can tell you that this plank represents the straight and narrow path... that you, as a husband, must follow.
- Okay, bring on the leeches.!
- The what?
Leeches.
They represent- I don't know- hookers and stuff.
Leeches.
They represent- I don't know- hookers and stuff.
Just don't fall in.
Hit it.

[Earl] I really wanted to stay up on that plank and away from those leeches a whole lot... but not as much as I wanted Randy to be happy.
Damn it.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoopsie-daisy!
[Screaming]
Things are sucking my face!
Things are sucking my face!
- That's okay.
I can, uh- - [Diego] No.
Wait, wait, Earl.
You know what?
The old me would've said one and done, right?
But karma says two out of three!
To the hot coals!
- Yeah!
- [Crowd Cheering]
[Earl Narrating] To give Randy his shot, I planned on steppin'on the hot coals... and then stepping'right back off.
What I didn't plan on was how hard it is to change direction on hot coals.
[Crowd Groans]
It burned like hell, but at least Randy was gonna be able to step in and be the hero.
I'm sorry, Catalina.
I guess I'm just not-
Earl, this is your lucky day.
- One out of three?
- To the field of rakes!
[Cheering]
[Earl Narrating] Diego said somethin' about the field of rakes... representin'the careful dance of talkin'about your wife's weight.
But for me, it represented the last chance to help Randy.
- [Grunts] - [Crowd Groans]
Okay, that's it.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Catalina.
I gave him several chances, and he just keeps proving himself not worthy.
But how am I supposed to get back to America?
Catalina?
- Can I try and marry you?
- You would do that?
To the pit of leeches!
[Crowd Cheering]
[Earl Narrating] I was a little worried about Randy walking'on that thin plank... 'cause I had seen him fall off sidewalks before.
But if it meant rescuing'Catalina, he could've danced on the head of a pin.
[Crowd Exclaiming]
- [Cheering]
- Wow.
- Yeah.
- # [Man Singing Rock]
[Earl Narrating] And watchin'Randy cross those hot coals...
I realized he probably wouldn't have failed gym class...
- if Catalina had gone to our high school.
- [Cheering]
# [Continues]
Everything was goin'great for Randy.
[Crowd Shouting]
And even when it didn't go great, nothin'stopped him.
Yea!
I did it!
I did it!
[Crowd Groans]
[Earl Narrating] And in return for his sacrifice...
Randy got to marry the woman he loved.
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
[Cheering]
You're a good friend.
[Earl Narrating] He thought about tellin'his new wife that he loved her... but he didn't want to risk ruining'his wedding day.
# [Man Singing In Spanish]
Thanks for lettin' me be the hero.
You've been the hero all along, Randy.
I was just gettin' in your way.
- [Yelps] - [Crowd Cheering]
That's so she doesn't get too full of herself.
Oh.
[Earl Narrating] Yep, it was a successful trip.
I was feelin'happy, and notjust 'cause of my airplane pills.
I was happy 'cause I helped bring Catalina back home... and I helped get Randy closer to the woman he loved.
# [Continues]
And I taught a bad guy about bein'good.
What happened?
Who took your pants?
Oh, man, that's my thing.
It was the same bandidos who chopped off Mario's fingers.
- This time, they cut out his tongue.
- Cut out your tongue?
[Garbled] I don't want to talk about it.
How dare they do this to my nephew in my village?
They said because they heard you were nice now, they could do as they please.
Did they?
Okay, well, forget karma.
New rule:
Do bad things, and Diego happens.!
- Wolverines!
- [Gunshots]

Very impressive record.
Italy, Belgium, North Africa, Dunkirk.
Nobody's gonna win this war hiding in a foxhole.
And tomorrow, you and your men are off to Holland.
Operation "Market Garden" as part of the First Airborne Brigade.
I'm not at liberty to discuss this.
As of this moment, Oaptain, the parameters of the mission for you and your men have changed.
~shuffling~
Operation Matchbox.
You will be leading the last drop.
~dramatic music in crescendo~
~music~
~ Banks ~ This rickety bugger's about to take us into the unknown, gentlemen.
For those of you who don't know me there's only one rule in my command.
Every man is a soldier, and I expect every soldier to do his duty without exception.
We have a job to do, boys, so let's get it done.
Good luck and God bless.
I'll buy you all a beer when we get home.
~McMillan ~ Thank you, sir.
~ Oates ~ Maintain course on 139, can you confirm?
~ Pilot over radio ~ Roger, Matchbox.
Keep a steady course.
Bit of a crosswind due east.
Other than that, blue skies all the way.
~music~
Fresh coordinates, Lieutenant.
~ Pilot over radio ~ Roger, Matchbox,
Breaking away from the pack on new heading.
Due south, southeast on 279, over.
L- zee's here?
~ Banks ~ And rendezvous here.
~explosions~
Ohaps.
I'd say we just about lost the element of surprise.
Get this glider down, gentlemen, we're counting on you.
~ Banks ~ It's going to start getting a bit choppy, lads.
Oan I go home, sir?
I've changed me mind.
I left the gas on!
~ Banks ~ Put a bag on it, Ives.
Your life's one big holiday.
~shout over radio~
~ Pilot over radio ~ We've been hit I
Losing altitude.

Thanks for the lift, good luck.
Disengage, Simkins.
~strains~

~whipping~
Brace yourself, Oaptain.

Brace!
Good luck, lads.
~ Soldier~ Hold on!

~male and female sighs of pleasure~
~ Gustav ~ And now I would like to explore this particular avenue of pleasure.
~loud clack and surprised gasps~
~ Gustav ~ How dare you I Gustav Handsfeldt, S. S.
Don't you know who I am?
~Max ~ Olear.
Voller.
You are- so alive!
And-and looking so-well!
I'll- leave-you-gentlemen to your reunion.
U hm, Gustav-
I will see you next Thursday.
I hope.
Yes.
Bye.
~gasps~
What's it like?
Screwing a rat?
~Voller~ Tell us where it is hidden.
It's all gone!
The S. S. took everything!
I swear it I
He's lying.
But this- this is crazy!
~laughs ~
We are old friends.
We still are!
You know it was not me who sent you to the Russian front, huh?
Shoot him.
No, all right then!
Everything is there!
It's all hidden away.
Somewhere near Arnhem.
But you need me, you need me, Vollerl
You know that!
You cannot kill me!
Good point.
~gunshot and shouts~
~gasping~
Now, I have all the necessary papers.
You can't - you can't get through without me.
Take him!
Good.
~Voller~ I told you he would crumble.
Yoo hoo, when you finish congratulating yourselves-
~Voller~ Bravo, bravo.
Thank you.
Have you ever thought of taking it up professionally?
The acting, I mean.
Yes, as it happens, I have.
A thousand Reich Marks per performance, remember?
Yes, of course.
Thank you, darling.
He might still doublecross us.
Of course he will.
But he will be dead by then.
I don't like him.
~ Katrina ~ I'll wait for you.
Nothing personal, Gustav.
J ust business.
Tch.
Take care.
~ Simkins ~ It's my eye.
~ Banks ~ How are you boys in the cockpit?
~ Oates ~ Oopilot needs attention.
~McMillan ~ Oheck the perimeter.
Oome on, everybody out.
Baker, how many you got?
Two, Sarge.
It's a bloody mess.
~McMillan ~ It's a bloody mess!
Try and hold still now, sir.
~ Banks ~ Simkins!
Simkins!
Get on to H Q, tell them we've missed the landing zone.
Sir.
Rally your troops, Sergeant.
Sir.
Did you manage to get a fix on our position, Lt?
Somewhere in Europe, eh.
We could be one, we could be twenty miles from the drop point.
No, he's dead, Wellings.
J ust give me his tags.
Good lad.
~McMillan ~ Okay, rations, canteens.
How are you doing, son?
Right boys, take your weapons take your kits.
We are after all, reputedly, the British army.
~ Banks ~ Seems to me if we missed the landing zone, we probably dropped over Jerry's head and right into his back garden.
Oh, that's bloody marvelous!
Have you ever seen any combat, Lt?
Baptism by fire.
Sir!
Sir!
I've got a signal-
~shooting~
~ Banks ~ Everybody down!
~shouting~
~ Banks ~ Everybody down!
Return fire!
~McMillan ~ Wellings, hit the deck, you plank!
~much shouting and shooting~
~ Soldier~ Need more ammol
~shouting~
~McMillan ~ Right, on my mark, go!
~ Soldier~ Ammunition!
~ Banks ~ Baker, with me!
Oovering fire, Sergeant!
Stay with the men!
Wellings, attend to the wounded!
Hey, where's the corp gone?
He's done a bunk!
~two gunshots~
~foreign language~
~ Banks ~ Took three of the buggers out.
~McMillan ~ Well done, sir.
~ Banks ~ Powell!
Where is he?
Last seen running in the opposite direction of fire, sir!
Baker, Wellings, Hayward.
With me up the right.
Sergeant, you take the Lieutenant up the left.
Stay with these men, Sergeant.
At all costs.
~McMillan ~ Of course, sir.
Good luck, sir.
Oontempt for death, gentlemen!
Oontempt for death!
~ Baker~ Get up!
Get up!
Now!
Out of the way!
Move it!
Stay with mel
~much shooting and shouting~
Reload!
~ Banks ~ Keep your shape, gentlemen!
I can't go running!
I can't go running!
Fight on through, Wellings!
~ Banks ~ Baker!
~ Baker~ I'm all right, Sarge!
~whimpers~
Oovering fire, Wellings!
I need cover!
~ Banks ~ On your feet, Sir!
Talk to mel
~ Baker~ I'm okay I
Agh!
Oovering fire!
Agh!
Agh!
Sarge!
You all right?
~McMillan ~ It's just in the leg I
Keep-moving-ladsl
I've got a jam.
Medic!
~German over radio~
They are all dead, crash site clear.
You shoot better than you fly.
Lucky for you.
Sarge, it's okay, hold on!
I'm okay!
More than I can say for your dancing career.
Wellings!
Medic!
Ooordinates to the Lieutenant.
No sir, don't say that!
You do that, sir!
Stay in there, sir!
Oome on!
Damn it!
Our Father- hallowed be-
Elizabeth I
~ Baker~ What a bloody shame.
~melancholy music~
What are we gonna do, sir?
You got a priest in there?
~mumbles~
Huh?
Too late for him.
You!
Get out of here!
Get out!
I'm very sorry, sir.
~foreign language~
~ Gustav ~ Ah, only your timing could be so apt.
You survive the murder hole of the Russian Front you dodge a firing squad, lie your way across Europe-
A deserter, a thief.
And you get within 500 meters of the prize, the Allies invade.
You have all the luck of a dead man.
~groans~
Remind me again!
Why are we keeping him alive?
Hans!
We still need him!
But there's a squadron of S. S. led by a major.
Kessler.
Who's Kessler?
Kessler is an old friend.
He organized your Lieutenant's "winter holiday. "
Go back.
Keep an eye on them.
Did you not know?
He has taken over Operation Libertine and now under Goering's official umbrella, he has expanded it somewhat.
You said all we had to do was frighten the bookkeeper.
Now it's Major Kessler, the S. S.
and the entire Allied invasion.
What do you suggest we do after lunch, Lt?
Kidnap Ohurchill?
Nothing is as black as you paint it, Beck.
No?
~Max ~ They're pulling out!
You see?
All things come to those who wait!
~Max ~ Heading this way.
~ Beck~ The bookkeeper!
Oome here!
~ Gustav ~ Major!
Major!
And to think, Sergeant, we've only just met.
~groans~
Stupid I
No sense of humor.
~McMillan ~ Tighter.
Pull it tighter, you plank.
Shall I get the morphine?
No, you hit me with any of that gear,
I'll be sparko for over a month.
Not if we give you it little by little.
Stick it up his arse.
~McMillan ~ What are you offering, jock?
No one touches me with impunity, sunshine.
We have to move out.
What's the Sarge gonna do with a bum leg?
Hop?
We'll leave the sargeant here.
Oarry on with our objectives.
Report his position.
With what, Tonto?
Smoke signals?
The radio's knackered.
No one is getting dug in.
We move out together as a unit and you, Powell!
When I want your bloody opinion, I'll ask for it.
All right?
~McMillan ~ Who's got the map and orders?
Map's only any use when you know where you are.
~McM illan ~ Take a gander.
Lieutenant!
All due respect, Sargeant, he's not army regular.
~ Oates ~ What?
And you are?
~ Baker~ We don't have time for this.
Hey, just 'cause I'm all right with a peashooter don't make me a team leader.
I'm a pilot, for Ohrissake.
Oh yeah?
Flying what?
Kites?
Well, Oanada, looks like you got the job, son.
You've got seniority so start bleeding using it.
God help us.
~McM illan ~ Right then, ladies.
Pack up your troubles.
We're moving out.
~groans~
We're due to go to M iami Beach.
Hope you don't mind.
~foreign language~
Happy?
Beck!
Bring the bookkeeper.
The soup-is excellent!
My compliments.
~Voller~ We are here to look for certain items.
I think you know what I am referring to.
You're wasting your breath.
These are two dirty collaborators, they work for the highest bidder.
There was a husband but, er-
~tch~ ~laughs~
You know Kessler, he likes his women single.
All right, bookkeeper, talk.
Before we get down to specifics, what is the deal?
I let you live.
~bookkeeper groans~
~music~
Olear.
~ Gustav ~ These buttons need to be pushed in sequence.
Punch in the wrong one, boom!
Blown to Berlin.
If there anything unpleasant waiting for us down here
I'll kill you before you can blink.
~clack~
This way.
I think we got ourselves a situation here, Sarge-
Oi, beat it.
According to my calculations, battle is going on over here.
Following these coordinates, we're heading in the complete opposite direction.
Whatever our objective is died with Oapt.
Banks.
Thought you were here to take a bridge.
These orders are directing us to a target in the middle of nowhere, what kind of assignment are you on?
I dunno Oanada, you tell me, I ain't got the foggiest.
Two days ago before kick-off,
I was reassigned Dennis Baker.
Bomb disposal and boy, does he have some previous.
Wellings, last time he fought a round was back in basic.
Oh, he's got a bit of medical training though.
Speaks a dozen languages.
He's fallen straight into Airborne?
Oh no.
That ain't right.
Us being here is no accident.
Yeah, this is all ass backwards.
Yeah.
What about pretty boy Powell?
What's his beef?
What, the ice cream?
First time I ever clapped eyes on him was when he stepped onto the glider.
You're kidding me.
No.
I'll tell you, that boy knows more than he's letting on.
Oertainly acting like no corporal I've ever met.
You know how I figure it?
I think when Banks bought the farm, he left the kid carrying the can.
Since we're on a need to know basis
I figure he don't think we need to know.
Yes.
For now, we're just slowing him down.
Any rate, keep running in this direction we should walk slap bang into the Americans.
~Yankee Doodle melody~
Move it up!
Move it up!
Woo hooooo!
I nform H Q we've taken the bridge.
~ Colt ~ J ust don't tell'em how easy it was.
You got a cigarette?
~ Soldier~ Yeah.
Ain't no Kraut gonna set foot on the far shore under my watch.
At this rate, we'll make Berlin before Monty or Patten.
~ shooting ~
It's a hell of a war, Jack.
H uh, you can say that again.
I say, it's a hell of a war, Jack.
Don't you got something to do?
Oh yeah.
~laughs~
~shooting~
~ Gustav ~ You call this a getaway car?
Where did you steal this bucket of rust?
What we need is a truck.
I can get you a truck in Arnhem.
And I also have a contact in Switzerland who because it is me, well, he will give us a good deal, yes?
So.
What do you say?
Equal shares?
What about Max?
Do we really need him?
I'm surprised at you.
Oh!
~soft music~
I know your face.
North Africa, Royal Engineers, Black Watch.
Horrible time, it was.
You get sand in places you never knew you had.
Listen, pal, you didn't cop a look at those movement orders when you passed'em on from the Oaptain?
Do me a favor, Private.
What's that, then?
Don't talk to me.
Ever.
I'm sorry about what happened back at the crash.
I just froze.
And you saved my life.
What are you gonna do?
Give me a kiss?
Do I look like a sailor?
No, sir.
Listen, son, you're not in school now, you don't have to call everybody sir.
No, sir.
How long have you been with Airborne?
1941, Judge said this or two years in chokey.
Supposed to be over by Christmas.
They've been throwing me out of airplanes ever since.
Been with McBastard since day one.
I don't know who gets on his pip more, me or the Jerries.
It's not how I'd imagined.
I don't know, I thought- thought it'd be more heroic.
Maybe I'd win a medal.
Listen, son.
You have to shoot people.
What are you gonna do when the Bosch turn up?
Wave your thermometer at'em?
Blind'em with your Latin?
You wanna win a medal- I'll give you a little pearl.
Someone has a pop- you have a pop back.
~ Oates ~ Bogey, eleven o'clockl
~ Ives ~ Oh nol
~ Baker~ Move down I
~ Powell~ Make for the treeline!
~ Powell~ Sarge, move it!
~ Ives ~ Come on, Sargel
Ooward!
Ooward!
~ Ives ~ At this range, might as well be spitting on him.
~ Ives ~ Come on, Sarge, on your feet I
~ Baker~ He's coming round again I
~ Ives ~ He's coming round again I
Sarge?
Sarge!
~ Ives ~ Come on, Sargel
~McMillan ~ J ust stay where you arel
Get off!
~ Ives ~ Come on, Sargel
~shooting~
~ Ives ~ Move it, you ugly-
~ Ives ~ Wellings!
What are you doing?
Wellings, where are you going?
Stay there, Wellings!
Private, you get back here!
~shouting~
~ Ives ~ Wellings, you'll never pick him upl
~ Oates ~ Come on, run I
Five bob says he makes it.
Ten bob says he don't.
~ Ives ~ Wellings, run I
~music~
~shouting~
Wellings- you're a bloody fool.
~ Oates ~ But a brave one, eh?
~McMillan ~ Wellings, don't you ever disobey a direct order again.
Or I'll have you up on charges, you beautiful little boy.
~happy laughing~
Gentlemen, when we finish congratulating ourselves the pilot has probably given our position away which means we have one hour headstart.
~ Oates ~ That's if he makes it.
We need to keep moving.
~ Oates ~ We hit him I
~ Powell~ Lieutenant.
~ Oates ~ He ever let up?
He's losing fuel.
All right, lads.
You heard the corporal.
~ Ives ~ Oome on, you big berk.
Back on your heads.
~Wellings ~ Steady on, sir.
~ Oates ~ I missed you back there.
Turn around, you're gone.
~McMillan ~ Right.
Picnic's over.
Keep your eyes out.
I know you asked me never to speak to you again.
But you do owe me ten bob.
Yeah?
Take it outta that.
~soft piano music~
~ Kessler~ What is to report?
Oolonel Dorffman is confident he will drive the allies back.
The colonel's confidence is admirable if a little misplaced.
I promised the Fuhrer his prize.
I gave him my word, he will accept nothing less.
The Fuhrer holds a special place for you in his heart.
You have an enviable position in the S. S.
Ja, it would be a tragedy to have it cut short by a firing squad.
Make the necessary arrangements for the transportation of the merchandise.
~ Kessler~ It must be in Berlin before the Allies take Holland.
Do not fail me.
~clicks heels~
~explosions~
~church bell slowly ringing~
~Gustav sobbing~
Don't kill me, please.
~gunshot~
Run.
Now it was Kessler who betrayed you, not me.
Run!
You took your time.
Where's our friend?
I let him go.
Good.
Did you find a truck?
Yeah.
But I couldn't take the risk of driving it through.
The place is surrounded by troops.
We will wait till nightfall when our Panzer division arrive.
The infantry will be pulled back, so when the shelling begins- we use the barrage as cover to slip through.
What about the checkpoints?
Gustav Hansfeldt, S. S.
That's nice.
The fog of war.
What better time for a robbery.
To Switzerland.
Switzerland.
~music~
For liberation.
For us.
I will be back before dawn.
~music~
I brought you bread and some wine.
~soft piano music~
You could come into the house.
So could Kessler.
I wanted to say thank you.
For what you did.
Those guards you shot- they were-
I am very grateful.
~ Ives ~ Pint of bitter, a fish supper.
Bit of slap and tickle down the Palace.
~McMillan ~ Oh, do shut up, Ives.
~ Ives, sings softly ~ Outside the lunatic asylum when I was picking up stones jumps a loony, says to me "Morning-"
~ Oates ~ Sarge.
Powell's gone.
So are the orders.
~click~
~ Oates ~ Drop it, scout.
And the. 38.
You too-lady.
~ Oates ~ They're in herel
So what-took a little walk in the moonlight?
Rendezvous with your sweetheart?
Afraid you might get lost.
Took the map and coordinates with you, right?
~McMillan ~ On your knees!
Wellings, secure that weapon.
~ Oates ~ All right, enough of the horseradish.
Now what the hell is going on, Powell?
If that is your name.
~ Powell~ It's classified.
I'll classify a bullet right up your posterior unless you start talking right now.
I don't think you will.
Not if any of you want to get home.
What's with the charade?
It's classified, top secret.
Which means if it all goes belly-up no-one's the wiser.
~ Powell~ Quite possibly.
Oh, this is bollocks!
Do you speak German?
He's a Nazi spy.
We pop him and we go home.
~foreign language~
What is she saying?
I n English.
She's telling us to be quiet.
I nform her we're Matchbox.
Sarge?
Go on then.
~foreign language~
If you are "Matchbox", I am "Source Magdalen".
~McMillan ~ Ives, door.
How many Germans at the target location?
Only one.
But more are expected tomorrow.
We do not have much time.
Where's Jan?
Jan is dead.
And you are late.
~McMillan ~ Late for what?
What are we late for, pal?
I'm with Military Intelligence.
S O E.
Under the cover of Operation Market Garden.
My directives are to intercept a VIP bound for Berlin.
VIP?
What VIP?
That's classified.
Myself and Oaptain Banks were to rendezvous with a source from the Dutch Resistance.
Wellings here will translate.
'Oause he speaks the lingo.
What about the rest of my lads, Powell?
We needed cover to get in.
We're the cannon fodder.
No!
No!
Look.
What's being asked of all of you is extremely vital for the war effort.
Help me make the rendezvous.
I'll do the rest.
You believe him?
Why don't we suck it and see?
~explosions and shooting~
~ British Captain ~ Contact H Q, tell them we've taken the transportation depot.
~Voller~ Oease-fire.
All right, spread out, stay alert.
~breathless~ British.
Now.
Now what?
I nvisible cloaks?
Wait.
~loud buzzing~
~ British Captain ~ I ncoming I
~ British soldier~ Take coverl Returning firel
Tank support's arrived.
German efficiency.
Bang on time.
Okay.
Let's go.
~shouting and explosions~
~explosion and scream~
We're being over-run I Retreat I Retreat I
Pull backl Pull backl
~ German soldier~ Halt I Halt I
~ Beck~ Let's get out of here!
~music~
~ Gustav ~ They held me at gunpoint.
Tortured me for information of the location.
Then they dumped me in the middle of a war zone.
If your brave men had not found me,
I may have starved to death.
~ Kessler~ How many men run with him?
~ Gustav ~ Oh, sir, well, four or five of them.
I
- I managed to kill a couple before they overpowered me.
Now there's- just a sniper farmhand and this mad psychotic thing called Beck.
I don't think he likes me.
We should have killed Voller when we-
Do not say that name to me.
The S. S. have latitude to do many things.
M urdering lieutenants in the German army is not one of them.
At least not without good reason.
But Major, Voller has betrayed us.
He is a liar.
And a thief.
Ja.
Herr Major- far be it for me to tell you your duty but- should not we be in pursuit?
~gasps~
Gustav, by tomorrow evening, you, I and the entire shipment will be in Berlin.
There are only two possible routes to the farm.
As of 1800 hours, one here is in the hands of the Americans.
But the other here are all troops are defending with excessive zeal and resilience!
~Gustave breathes deeply~
Given that the combined British American forces cannot break through, what chance of a rogue lieutenant and his band of thieves?
~loud electric guitar music~
Wake up.
Wake up, minefield up ahead.
What?
Which way?
Right.
No, no!
Left.
Are you sure?
Trust me, left.
~tires screech~
Er, hang on, I think-
Oh!
~music~
~flapping of bird's wings~
No, Fritz.
'Oause that would piss me right off.
All clear!
Hands up where I can see'em!
Gun down, hands up!
Schnell!
Good boy.
Now over here- come on, left, right, left, right.
I know you lot march, I've seen you on the wireless.
~loud thud~
Aye, aye.
Who's a crafty little Nazi?
You enjoying this, eh?
Hang on.
Blimey, this how Adolf pays you a lot?
I'm on the wrong side.
Where'd you get this?
Eh?
Vie getten sie dis?
~ Powell~ Ives, bring the prisoner outside.
Sir!
Right.
There we are, sir.
Bit frisky.
But he's all right now.
How would you like to meet a British Officer?
~Wellings ~ Let's get you inside now, sir.
And take a look at that leg.
~McMillan ~ Powell, you got the squad.
~ Ives ~ Here we are, sir.
H is gun's up there, he's been frisked and cleaned.
And now he's me best mate.
~ Powell~ Secure him upstairs.
Sir.
Move!
Baker, with me.
Everybody else- get in the house.
Later on, me and you are gonna have a nice little chat.
Oome on!
Raus!
Is it them?
Well, it is definitely one of our trucks.
Why don't you get out and take a look?
Put our minds at ease.
~explosions~
Here?
Now?
Of course.
Yes, it's the mad psychotic Beck!
~thud~ ~motor starts up~
Major, what are you doing?
You have a choice.
I shoot you now or I leave you as I found you, lying through your teeth in the middle of nowhere.
Which will it be, hm?
I, I swear.
Oh, no, no, Major, please!
Please.
Major!
Major!
~motor fades away~
Shit.
~ 1 st American soldier~ Well, lookie here.
~ 2nd Am. soldier~ Hey, Sargel Check that guy.
~ 1 st Am. soldier~ Hands up.
~ 3rd American soldier~ We got ourselves a porker, sir.
God bless U ncle Sam.
I should have left you for the Oossacks.
Left me?
Who pulled who from the burning truck?
Who's idea was it to drive through a minefield in the first place?
Well, I have seen men get the I ron Oross for less.
I'm sure they will let you wear it when they hang us both.
You would have died 10 times over if it were not for me.
I was as good as dead from the moment we met.
You steal the treasure from under Kessler's nose and he gets a bullet from the Fuhrer.
Look me in the eye and tell me-
Look me in the eye- and tell me this is not just about revenge.
Out of my way-Lieutenant.
Where are you going?
Anywhere you are not!
Then they will shoot you for desertion!
They can only kill me once.
Beck!
This was not an order from H igh Oommand.
This was a business proposal!
All right, so I wanted to get my own back on Kessler.
But that does not mean we can't get rich into the bargain!
Hansl Hansl You do not walk out on your partner halfway through a deal!
Hans, it's-you do-
~distant explosions and chirping~
You see, I knew you were smart.
I knew it!
The Americans!
~Yankee Doodle Dandy melody~
This whole plan is-
~Voller~ I am telling you, it will work.
You just need to be a little less-
Less what?
German.
Think cowboy.
~ American accent ~ How you doin', ma'am?
~ American accent ~ Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir.
Try it with me.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir!
Yeehaw!
Heehaw.
Yahoo!
Yeehaw!
Hee-haa!
Heehaww!
Hee-haw.
How do I sound?
Like Hans from Dusseldorf.
We are dead.
Heehaw!
~ Gustav ~ We are talking about millions here.
Priceless artifacts, antiques.
Rare coins, paintings.
All taken by the S. S.
~ Gustav ~ Those Nazi swine are ruthless, ja?
The interesting thing is that there are only three people who know about it.
Now, that's you, that's me, and the kind Lieutenant here.
That's enough.
~ Soldier~ Yes, sir.
You still got those cigars?
Yeah, there's a couple left.
Give him one.
~ Gustav ~ Oh, oh.
Thank you.
You trying to get at something, mister?
Well, America's the land of opportunity, ja?
So, surely if the spoils of war should-just happen to- fall into the brave hands of such good men as yourselves.
~ Oolt ~ You trying to cut yourself a deal?
No, look, no, I-
I prefer to think of it as a "business" proposition.
Hey, soldier.
Give this guy a light.
Thank you.
Get him out of here.
Eh?
Yes, but we will discuss-
Let's go, buddy.
That's it.
What do you make of all that?
~ Shannon ~ It's getting interesting.
You can say that again.
It's getting interest-
~ Powell~ Oan you defuse it?
~ Baker~ If you stop breathing down my neck, you see, if you cut the wrong wire-
Ever play Russian roulette, Oorporal?
See, this job requires experience nerve
and a hell of a lot of stupidity.
~snip~
I've had enough.
See- this is not a bright and shiny VI P, is it, Oorporal?
Just do your job.
I'll be outside, just in case.
Oh, it's time out, is it, Corporal?
I can smell it off you.
~sigh~
My name is Bobby.
Bobby Oates.
I'm from Windsor, you know?
It's just near the Detroit border.
Some hot water.
I don't understand.
There was definitely some morphine left!
It was in here.
I distinctly remember it being here.
You're taking the piss, aren't you?
No, Sarge.
Ohrist's sake.
~ Benitta ~ There is schnapps.
I'm not drinking bloody Kraut nonsense.
~ Oates ~ 90 proof.
~Wellings ~ Bite on this, sir.
Just like my great granddad used to make-
~McMillan ~ All right, I'll have some of that, then.
~Wellings ~ That's not gonna help at all.
Yeah, it will.
There'll be a sudden surge of pain.
If you could lie down, sir.
Make his head comfortable.
~ Oates ~ Schnapps.
~Wellings ~ Lie down, sir.
Make his head comfortable.
Lie down, sir.
~McMillan ~ Oww!
~Wellings ~ Now this is gonna really hurt.
~gasps in pain~
Hold him down.
Very good.
~shouting in great pain~
Look at that.
Olark Gable.
~distant shouts of pain~
That's what we do to our own.
Oan you imagine what we're gonna do to you, Fritz?
~distant loud shout~
Fancy a smoke?
No?
Please yourself.
~music~
~McMillan ~ Get that bullet out of my leg I
Now listen.
~foreign language~
All right.
We don't have to be nasty.
You and me could be mates.
Eh?
"Matenzes. "
This is so beautiful.
Where'd you get this?
Hey, hey, hey.
You were saying?
Green?
Or green?
~ Colt ~ So Gustav, what you're telling me is you put this whole shebang together?
The stolen art treasures, the booby-trapped barn, eh?
~ Gustav ~ Yes, it is therefore because of me alone that I will take you to the plunder.
I think we can get some help from Lt. Shannon.
I have been planning this for years.
~Voller~ If we have to talk, I talk.
Looks like you two took a beating.
Where you headed, soldier?
Oh, wait, I gotta get clearance.
Whoa, fellas, wait, wait.
I said wait.
Who's side are you on?
You don't cross until I-get the okay.
I get clearance, you get auf Wiedersehen.
Auf Wiedersehen?
Yeah, that's Kraut, for "Get the hell out of here. "
Auf Wiedersehen.
~in German~ Danke shon.
Whoa, what unit you say you were from?
~Voller~ Go!
Do I have a choice?
~ Colt ~ Hold your fire.
Hold your firel
What the hell's going on?
They're Germans!
Two day pass for anybody who brings me the heads of those two sons of bitches!
~Voller~ That was close!
What happened to Gustav?
~ Shannon ~ He slipped away.
God damn it!
God damn it!
~Voller~ Get off the road!
Which way?
You looking for, the scenic route?
Go left!
I think we need to go right!
Left!
Trust me, left!
~foreign language~
Next time, I say we head for Switzerland.
We head for Switzerland.
~loud humming~
Oh nol
Quick!
Get out!
Out!
~tapping~
~bird cries out~
Say, er- last night in the forest- that Jan was, was, was he your-
My husband.
Geez, I'm sorry.
Do you have a family?
Someone special?
Well, I-
I got a lot of "someones, " you know.
Er, but, er- no-one special.
Well, at least not yet anyway.
~snap~
Corporal Powell.
The man with a plan.
Feel like sharing it?
J ust stay alert.
~sighs~
You know, pink suits you.
Baker, what the hell do you think you're doing?
Drinking.
Why?
What you gonna do?
Put me up for court martial again?
I've been burnt, blew up,
I've been busted back to private.
So what are you gonna do!
Sober up.
I need you focused.
Sobered up?
Let me show you something they don't teach you at Sandhurst.
Oh, big guy.
~ Oates ~ Holster that weapon!
Sarge.
~ Oates ~ Holster your weapon.
Keep out of this, Lt.
What kind of soldiers are you?
Powell!
You're here to liberate us, not get drunk and shoot each other.
What's the difference?
A bullet or a bomb?
Put it away.
Put it away.
~clicks tongue~
Put it away.
~clicking~
Good boy.
Enough of this VIP crap.
What's in the goddamn barn?
~ Oates ~ Tell us all what is so important it's worth the lives of 25 men and don't you give me any of that king and country bullshit!
~ Ives ~ We know what's down there, don't we, Fritz?
This ain't no cloak and dagger job.
We're here-on the rob.
Oome on.
Thank you.
~ Beck~ Now what, genius?
Plan B?
Fill our pockets and run like thieves?
~Voller~ We are not leaving without the lion's share.
We'll wait for something to happen.
And when it does-
We pounce.
That's your plan?
Yeah.
So, we're here to steal the Nazi loot.
~ Benitta ~ The Germans have stripped our country bare.
In a few hours, it will all leave for Berlin.
There's an impregnable strongroom underneath the barn.
Baker's job is to get us in there.
Never gonna happen.
~ Oates ~ If we can't defuse it, then we blow it up.
How long to do that?
Re-route the circuits.
Blow it from a distance.
Done in no time.
No, those are not the orders from London.
You heard the lady, we're on the clock with this, blow it.
No offence.
None taken.
Oanada, have you lost your bleedin' mind?
Are you talking about blowing up a ton of loot?
Who care who gets it?
As long as it isn't H itier.
Oi, muggins, we can't get to it.
It's booby-trapped.
Booby-trapped, my ass.
Laughing boy here is supposed to be an expert.
Look son, no-one's interested.
Really?
So when you're back home wobbling on what's left of that leg of yours and your wife and kids are starving on your disability pension, you'll say to yourself
"We did the right thing there, blowing up a king's ransom. "
I'm not a thief.
I'm an opportunist.
Wellings, you got a say in this?
I haven't got any children.
~ Powell~ We access the payload, retrieve it then as per instructions divert it to British soil.
Wait, divert?
You said "secure" not "divert. "
That's a different matter.
He was gonna nick it anyway.
All I'm saying is that if we dip into this it's mission accomplished, Whitehall's happy, you're still serving king and country and no one can ever ask after it because it's top secret.
And we all come out of this with something other than bullet wounds and boring war stories.
And I'll be honest.
You'll get no help from me without it.
Whatever you decide, make it quick.
Kessler will be here soon.
He'll become suspicious if there are no guards.
Still haven't answered my question.
How do you expect to divert this cargo?
~ Powell~ They're sending a seaplane to take it to Berlin.
The mission and orders are to steal it.
I say we blow it to kingdom come with him in it!
I can't do this by myself.
~ Powell~ Who's with me?
~music~
~dramatic music~
Heil Hitler!
No wonder we are losing the war.
~ Snyder~ Take all of this to the jetty.
This is genuine Vermeer.
~foreign language~
N ice and easy, lads.
Let's make these square heads feel at home.
Sshh.
~loud clicking~
~ Ives ~ Five men, four men- three men, two men.
One man and his dog, Spot.
~ sings ~ Went to mow some Jerries.
~muffled complaint~
~ Saskia ~ Sorry.
Stay here till I get back.
~foreign language~
~humming of plane~
~Voller~ The pilot.
The pilot is our way in.
Or rather out.
~foreign language~
Heil H itier, eh?
U h-huh.
Find a way of getting aboard that plane.
What are you going to do?
Settle a score.
I thought you wanted to get rich, not even.
Okay.
Do not leave without me.
The thought never entered my head.
~ Oolt ~ Frank, right.
Yes, sir.
Dean, left.
Right on it, sir.
Sammy, put that mortar right there.
Yes, sir.
Looks like that prisoner was telling the truth after all.
Ain't no way in hell
I'm gonna let any Nazi bastard steal one nickel out of this country.
~music~
~ Ives ~ Aw, Ohrist.
Oome on now, pal.
You blow that bloody whistle like a good gentleman.
No, no, no.
Psst, Baker!
Baker, we're gonna go early.
We're going early.
You need to be ready for the signal.
What about him?
Get out of the line, Oorporal.
No, you dopey posh, git, get out of the way.
~ Kessler~ Voller.
You, close the lift shaft.
Prepare for an attack!
Full alert!
I knew I should have joined the bloody Navy.
~music and shooting~
~foreign language~
~ Saskia ~ Wait.
~Max ~ Keep down.
Oome on.
Oome on.
~music in crescendo~
Smile!
~shooting~
~Benitta screams~
Saskia!
Jesus Ohrist!
~McMillan ~ Baker!
Keep your head down!
~McMillan ~ Get your head do-!
~ Baker~ Agh!
Jesus!
~McMillan ~ Baker!
You want some?
Well, come on then!
~McMillan ~ Ives, where are you?
Ives?
Are you all right?
Shift yourself, Oorporal Powell.
~motor hums~
Hello, Klaus.
How could you betray me?
We were brothers!
We are brothers.
What happened to you?
~grunts and groans~
~ Kessler~ You-betrayed-yourself.
Ranging fire.
One round.
~quick footsteps~
~click of gun~
~whispers~ Where are you?
~ Kessler~ Come on I Where are you?
~ Kessler~ We put our guns down, Britisher, and fight.
~whispers softly~ Oome on.
~labored breathing~
~ Kessler~ That was close, ja?
~footsteps~
Very good.
There you go.
~heavy breathing and loud thud~
~ Kessler~ Nol
No!
Oome back here, you coward!
No!
Open fire.
It's all right.
I'm with the British I ntelligence.
I've got to destroy this barn.
~explosion~
Let's get out of here, soldier.
~American accent~ Yes, sir.
Who the bloody hell's that?
Some yank.
~ American Sargeant ~ Move, move, move!
~shouting of instructions to soldiers~
~ American Sargeant ~ Whoa, check your fire!
~McM illan ~ Oome on!
Quick as you can!
~ Ives ~ Got your passport?
Why are they shooting at us?
Because we're in a German plane, you berk!
Powell, move!
Shift yourself!
~shouting~
Where is Max?
~ Ives ~ Come on, Powell I
~ Oolt ~ Out him down!
Got that one.
~McMillan ~ Nearly there, son.
~McMillan ~ Come on, Powell I Move it I
~ Ives ~ Come on, Powell I
~ Ives ~ Bloody hell!
~ Ives ~ Powell, no!
~ Soldier~ Oh, we got him!
We got him!
~ Ives ~ Go, go, go!
What the hell are you waiting for, a taxi?
Go and tell the units to do whatever the hell they gotta do.
Oome on!
Move it out!
Let's go home, Jack.
Yes, sir.
~labored breathing~
~crunch~
~metal clang~
Snyder?
Herr Major.
Gustav.
You're alive.
Thank God.
Open the door.
Oh, what a coincidence, Herr Major.
We meet again.
Open the door immediately!
Step back, please.
Auf Wiedersehen, Gustav.
At last, Herr Major.
~deep groan~
~explosion~
~big explosion~
~Wellings ~ No, it looks far worse than it is.
Baker not with us?
~McMillan ~ No, he didn't make it, son.
Who's the yank?
I thought he was with you, sir.
How's it going, mate?
~Benitta screams~
~McMillan ~ Hold it right there!
Hold it right there!
Put the tool-!
~ Ives ~ Shoot and you go first!
Put it down!
I said I'll shoot you in the face!
~ Beck~ Lower your guns!
I said I'll shoot you in the grille!
~ Beck~ I'm gonna kill him!
It's getting kinda hard to concentrate with all this shouting.
How you doing?
~McMillan ~ Put the gun down.
~Voller~ You first.
You first.
~McMillan ~ Don't be a child!
Put the bloody gun down!
No.
I have been planning this since 1941.
Oh, no, me old china.
You lot been planning since you invaded Poland.
It's a question of what's fair.
~ Ives ~ Fair's a place where you win goldfish, son.
This property should be returned to its rightful owners.
~ Ives ~ You got a list, love?
~McMillan ~ Let's try and be sensible.
We've all just won.
We're not going to shoot.
Nobody wants to get hurt.
We just want- an equal share.
~explosion and shouts~
~McMillan ~ Whoa, whoal Calm down I Calm down I
~ Ives ~ Put him down I
What's happening?
Fire in No. 2 engine.
Brace yourselves, we're going down.
~ Benitta ~ Take my hand.
~ Ives ~ Brace yourself, mate.
~McMillan ~ Brace yourself, sunshine.
Hold on tight.
~McMillan ~ You're all right.
~ Ives ~ I don't believe this, Oanada.
I've only flown with you twice and both times you've crashed!
~ Oates ~ Anybody see a lake down there?
~melancholy music~
~McMillan ~ 'Shun!
Stay with the men.
~ Ives ~ We could have been rich as Solomon.
~McM illan ~ Oh, belt up, Ives.
It was for king and country.
Oome here.
~ Ives ~ Baker never did give me that ten bob.
I still don't know if Powell was his real name.
~Male guide ~ Heroic brave British troops risked their lives to save these priceless Dutch treasures from falling into the hands of Nazi Germany.
~ distant voice ~ Now, if you would like to follow me-
~music~

~glass breaking and alarm goes off~
Next stop?

NARRATOR:
Ninety degrees west.
One degree south.
A world lost in the vastness of the Pacific.
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
Home to the strangest life imaginable.
Governed by nature's brutal forces.
Islands which have transformed our understanding of life on Earth.
Galápagos lies remote, 600 miles off the coast of South America, astride the equator.
A scattering of 1 3 main islands, with more than 1 00 islets, rocks and reefs.
Each island has its own character.
Some are cloaked in forest, concealing life.
(BIRDS TWITTERING)
Others, smouldering giants, rugged and austere.
Haunt of pirates.
Lair of dragons.
All are the creation of one of the strangest features found anywhere on our planet.
Galápagos are no ordinary islands.
A mysterious, prehistoric world.
A landscape that profoundly influences life.
These islands are plumbed directly into the heart of the Earth.
An artery of superheated rock rises to the surface, from hundreds of miles beneath the crust.
It's a volcanic hotspot.
Galápagos constantly simmers, even beneath the waves.
These tiny bubbles of gas give a vital clue to the genesis of the islands.
Sea vents are like pressure valves, releasing growing tension from chambers of molten rock beneath the crust.
But if the pressure gets too much, this magma reaches bursting point.
(EXPLOSION)
The largest of all the Galápagos volcanoes, Sierra Negra, recently blew smoke and ash seven miles into the sky.
The only rivers here are rivers of red hot rock, at a scorching 1 1 00 degrees Celsius.
Galápagos is one of the most volcanic places on Earth.
The hotspot has been active for millions of years, building island after island.
But it's not just how these islands are born, but where they are born that makes Galápagos so special.
They've emerged at the crossroads of four major ocean currents, sweeping in from all corners of the Pacific.
This interplay of warm and cold currents, generates an extraordinary diversity of marine life.
Over 500 species of fish make the most of these plankton-rich waters.
Among them, residents like these barnacle blennies
and strange garden eels.
Even ocean travellers like scalloped hammerheads gather in huge numbers.
The converging currents that envelop Galápagos have also brought creatures to these shores from opposite ends of the Pacific.
Galápagos sea lions are related to Californian sea lions, that came here from the north.
And from as far south as the subantarctic, swam the ancestors of these birds,
Galápagos penguins.
The cold waters here allow them to survive on the equator.
Fish shoals like these seek refuge from open ocean predators by keeping near the shoreline.
But in Galápagos this strategy can be risky.
The coastal margins are the feeding grounds for the most aerobatic hunters,
Blue-footed Boobies.
When the fishing's good, they gather in their thousands.
Piercing calls synchronise an assault.
(SCREECHING)
Plunging in unison overwhelms their prey.
Blue-footed Boobies can dive in waters just three feet deep.
But as they chase the shoals further inshore, they risk treacherous undercurrents and hidden rocks.
But the biggest hazard is the battering surf.
A wing smashed by the breakers means slow and certain death.
Ghost crabs normally sift the sand for food, but they've always got an eye out for something meatier.
For creatures of the sea and air, Galápagos is a welcome sanctuary.
But these islands are not a choice destination for land animals.
Those that came here were probably victims of flash floods, swept out from the mainland on rafts of floating trees,
crossing 600 miles of ocean with no food and no fresh water.
For any survivor, landing in a place like this would be a daunting prospect.
Fernandina is the harshest, most volcanically active of all the Galápagos islands, a lava-scarred giant.
This is a single, monumental volcano with a caldera half a mile deep and nearly four miles wide.
Where the volcano meets the sea, dragons stir.
It's hard to tell reptile from rock.
These creatures are found nowhere else on Earth.
At dawn, the cold-blooded iguanas thaw from the night's chill, absorbing the heat of the equatorial sun.
When they've warmed, the coastline of Fernandina comes alive.
On this island, food is scarce
and the only way to find it involves a mission that seems suicidal.
Only the larger adults dare to take the plunge.
Marine iguanas are strong swimmers.
With a single breath, they can comfortably dive to 30 feet.
And all this effort for red and green algae, which thrive in the cold water.
Marine iguanas are the world's only sea lizards, but when their distant ancestors were washed ashore in Galápagos, they were land animals.
To survive, they were forced to tackle the ocean.
This male must graze as quickly as he can.
In these chilling waters, his body temperature falls fast.
A 1 0-minute dive is about the most he can manage before his muscles seize up.
Fighting the surge back to the shore is a Herculean task.
And to make matters worse, he must now run the gauntlet of sea lions.
They' re the last thing the iguana needs.
No harm is meant.
It's nothing more than a rather one-sided game of cat-and-mouse.
Marine iguanas take in too much salt with their food.
But with the help of special glands, they sneeze it out.
They also welcome these resourceful visitors.
Sally Lightfoot crabs like to groom them for algae, parasites and dead skin.
Lava lizards, far smaller reptilian relatives, have found their own ingenious ways to get by on this fierce shoreline.
They enjoy a special relationship with the sea lions.
The lizards rid them of flies, which can be a ticklish nuisance.
(FLIES BUZZING)
This sea lion accepts these predatory lizards.
Both benefit.
Survival depends on seizing every opportunity in this volcanic wasteland.
Fernandina is the youngest of all the main Galápagos Islands.
It may have raised its head above the waves as recently as 30,000 years ago.
It sits right above the volcanic hotspot, in the far west of the archipelago.
But how is it that the other islands, created at this same hotspot, are now scattered over hundreds of miles of ocean to the east?
All the islands are moving.
(BIRD SQUAWKING)
They' re travelling south-east at an inch or two a year on a massive tectonic plate which continually slides over the hotspot.
Their journey begins as soon as they' re born.
And in their wake, new islands emerge.
It's like a geological conveyor belt.
So the archipelago we see today is just a snapshot in time.
The oldest islands are in the east, the youngest in the west.
And as Fernandina ages, it will be carried on this conveyor belt to where the biggest of all the Galápagos Islands currently resides,
Isabela.
It's shaped like a giant seahorse, almost 1 00 miles long, with a backbone of volcanoes.
Isabela is a teenage Galápagos island, nearing a million years old.
Time enough for life to settle.
Its giant calderas still tower more than a mile above sea level and are draped in vegetation.
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
Although Isabela is softening with age, it's still close enough to the hotspot to remain active.
On its summits, like here on Alcedo Volcano, live the most iconic of all Galápagos animals.
Their ancient trails, carved over tens of thousands of years, scar the landscape.
Giant tortoises.
They are the largest of their kind in the world, weighing up to 5 50 pounds.
Water is a scarce resource on this island, and giant tortoises can survive months without it.
But during the wetter season, they gather to quench their thirst among a scattering of freshwater pools.
A tortoise oasis.
Around 5,000 live here on Alcedo.
It's the greatest concentration found anywhere in Galápagos.
Despite their extensive body armour, tortoises are vulnerable to skin parasites, which they are unable to remove themselves.
So they've developed a remarkable relationship with finches.
When they need a service, it's a sort of slow-motion pit stop.
A finch feeding frenzy.
This giant tortoise could live to be 1 50 years old.
During his lifetime, the island he roams, Isabela, will be transported about 20 feet south-east, on the Galápagos conveyor belt.
But a million years from now, that's about 6,000 tortoise lifetimes,
Isabela will be carried right to the heart of the Galápagos archipelago, to where these mature, middle-aged islands now lie.
Santa Cruz has been pulled so far from the hotspot that its volcanoes are now ancient ruins, worn by the passage of time and swallowed by forest.
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
Plants and soils now cover this ageing island, teeming with life.
Its peaks are still high enough to generate clouds and receive regular rainfall.
It's one of the few places in Galápagos where there are magical freshwater pools.
After a morning spent foraging at sea, frigate birds come here to bathe their feathers
and to sip on the wing.
These forest basins are created by layer on layer of rich volcanic soil packed over porous lava.
Elsewhere, the water filters its way through, to re-emerge near the coast in brackish lagoons.
They' re home to the most unlikely Galápagos residents,
Greater Flamingos, chance immigrants from the Caribbean.
There are only about 500 flamingos in Galápagos, limited to this rare habitat.
Along the margins of these mature islands, where it's drier and hotter, the landscape is dominated by giant cactus forest,
offering a perfect watchtower for the islands' top land predator, the Galápagos Hawk.
Something on the shoreline catches its attention.
Small lizards, birds and insects are the normal quarry.
But for a few weeks a year, there's much more on offer.
Marine iguanas prefer to keep to the water's edge, but during the nesting season, females must brave it inland to find soft soil in which to lay their eggs.
But she must go carefully.
The hawk patiently waits to see if she drops her guard.
She's reasonably safe.
Close to her nest burrow.
But stray too far from cover and she's courting trouble.
(HAWK CHIRPING)
The family has timed its breeding to coincide with this plentiful supply of food.
Both parents take turns to hunt for, and feed their growing chick.
He's only a few weeks old but he's got a healthy appetite.
He can comfortably eat half an iguana a day.
As the Galápagos Islands are carried further and further away from their place of birth, the volcanic hotspot, there's a remarkable progression.
From barren rock and ash-covered deserts, life gets a grip,
creeping inland to mellow and diversify.
But the story doesn't end there.
For every island is destined for a spectacular final flourish.
The oldest of them all, almost 1 00 times older than Fernandina, lies on the south-eastern perimeter of the archipelago.
Española.
Once a much larger volcano, all that remains is a dry, flat scrap of land.
This island is dying.
But it's been carried to a place where the nutrient-rich H umboldt Current gives it a last breath of life.
Its leeward, northern shores have softened through time and they' re a choice hangout for Galápagos sea lions.
A male controls a stretch of coastline, attracting up to 30 females and their young.
(GRU NTING)
Females give birth to a single pup, nourished on milk rich in protein and fat.
When the pups are about a month old, they join the local crèche.
It looks an easy life.
But for this 500-pound beach master, there's no time to relax.
Even with every ounce of effort, he'll be lucky to rule this stretch of sand for more than three weeks.
This is why.
There are constant challengers.
This time, the beach master wins, leaving his rival battered and scarred.
When the young sea lions are a year or two old, the bay becomes a training ground for social and hunting skills.
These waters are so rich, and the sea lions such effective predators, that it frees up time to enjoy.
Few sea creatures are as playful.
Though the northern side of Española is reasonably sheltered from prevailing winds,
the southern side takes the full brunt of everything the ocean throws at it.
Yet these cliffs are a mecca for seafaring iguanas, and a crucial nesting platform for resident seabirds.
The most majestic of all is a visitor, an ocean wanderer that roams the whole eastern Pacific.
The Waved Albatross is the largest bird in Galápagos, with a seven-foot wingspan.
After six months in the air, first touch down is never that simple.
Virtually the entire world population, some 1 2,000 breeding pairs, nest here on Española.
The male waits for days, sometimes weeks, for the arrival of his partner.
Waved Albatrosses may live for up to 50 years and pair for life.
They re-bond with a mesmerising courtship dance.
The whole colony comes alive with the clack of beaks.
For such huge birds, mating is a gentle affair.
The name, "Waved" Albatross, comes from the delicate pattern of their feathers.
Everything is gambled on a single egg which is incubated by both parents for two months, with each sitting for up to two weeks at a time, sometimes longer.
And the result of such careful and diligent nurture is this.
As the chicks age, their parents' foraging missions take them further and further afield, involving round trips of up to 2,000 miles.
The chicks are fed on pre-digested squid and fish, guzzling nearly half a gallon of oil in one big hit.
Finally, after almost six months, the juveniles and their parents begin to take to the air.
The young albatrosses won't be back to breed for another five or six years.
Their journey is just beginning.
But this island's journey is nearing its end.
Life here outlives the land.
During the last three and a half million years,
Española has travelled over 1 00 miles from its place of birth, the Galápagos hotspot.
Through that time, it's been cooling and contracting, fracturing and sinking.
One day it will end up beneath the waves.
All the islands will eventually follow, carried on the conveyor belt, to meet the same fate.
Countless Galápagos islands have come and gone.
They always have and they always will.
Just as the islands mature through time, so has our understanding of what makes them special.
The first person to set foot on Galápagos prayed only for deliverance from this wretched place.
In the centuries to follow, all who came here to plunder shared his view.
But in time, one man, inspired by the landscape and wildlife, would see things differently, discovering a secret that lay hidden within this island universe.
A secret that would transform not just how we saw these islands, but our whole understanding of life on Earth.
H is name was Charles Darwin.
In the next programme, we travel deeper into the heart of Galápagos and find out why these islands, more than anywhere else, are such a crucible for new life.
90 degrees west
1 degree south
A world lost in the vastness of the Pacific
Home to the strangest life imaginable
Governed by nature's brutal forces
Islands which have transformed our understanding of life on earth
Galapagos lies remote, 600 miles off the coast of South America astride the Equator
a scattering of 13 main islands with more than 100 islets, rocks and reefs
Each island has its own character
Some are cloaked in forest concealing life.
Others, smouldering giants, rugged and austere home to pirates,
lair of dragons
All are the creation of one of the strangest features found anywhere on our planet
Galapagos are no ordinary islands a mysterious prehistoric world
a landscape that profoundly influences life
These islands are plumbed directly into the heart of the earth
An artery of superheated rock rises to the surface from hundreds of miles beneath the crust
It's a volcanic hotspot
Galapagos constantly simmers even beneath the waves
These tiny bubbles of gas give a vital clue to the genesis of the islands
Sea vents are like pressure valves releasing growing tension from chambers of molten rock beneath the crust.
But if the pressure gets too much this magma reaches bursting point
The largest of all the Galapagos volcanos
- Sierra Negra recently blew smoke and ash 7 miles into the sky
The only rivers here are rivers of red hot rock at a scorching 1100 degrees Celsius
Galapagos is one of the most volcanic places on earth
The hotspot has been active for millions of years building island after island
But it's not just how these islands are born but where they're born that makes Galapagos so special
They emerged at the crossroads of four ocean currents sweeping in from all corners of the Pacific
This interplay of warm and cold currents generates an extraordinary diversity of marine life
Over 500 species of fish make the most of these plankton-rich waters
Among them, residents like these barnacle blennies and strange garden eels
Even ocean travelers like scalloped hammerheads gather in huge numbers
The converging currents that envelop Galapagos have also brought creatures to these shores from opposite ends of the Pacific
Galapagos sea lions are related to Californian sea lions, they came here from the North
And from as far south as the Subantarctic swam the ancestors of these birds
- Galapagos penguins
The cold waters here allow them to survive on the equator
Fish shoals like these seek refuge from open ocean predators by keeping near the shoreline
But in Galapagos, this strategy can be risky
The coastal margins are the feeding grounds for the most aerobatic hunters blue-footed boobies
When the fishing is good they gather in their thousands
Piercing calls synchronize an assault
Plunging in unison overwhelms their prey
Blue-footed boobies can dive in waters just 3 feet deep
But as they chase the shoals further in shore, they risk treacherous under currents and hidden rocks
But the biggest hazard is the battering surf
A wing smashed by the breakers means slow and certain death
Ghost crabs normally sift the sand for food, but they always got an eye out for something meatier
For creatures of the sea and air Galapagos is a welcome sanctuary
But these islands are not a choice destination for land animals
Those that came here were probably victims of flash floods swept out from the mainland on rafts of floating trees
crossing 600 miles of ocean with no food and no freshwater
For any survivor, landing in a place like this would be a daunting prospect
Fernandina is the harshest, most volcanically active of all the Galapagos islands, a lava scar giant
This is a single monumental volcano with a caldera half a mile deep and nearly 4 miles wide
Where the volcano meets the sea dragons stir
It's hard to tell reptile from rock
These creatures are found nowhere else on earth
At dawn, the cold-blooded iguanas thaw from the night's chill absorbing the heat of the equatorial sun
When they've warmed the coastline of Fernandina comes alive
On this island, food is scarce
and the only way to find it involves a mission that seems suicidal
Only the larger adults dare to take the plunge
Marine iguanas are strong swimmers
With a single breath, they can comfortably dive to 30 feet
And all this effort for red and green algae which thrive in the cold water
Marine iguanas are the world's only sea lizards
But when their distant ancestors were washed ashore in Galapagos they were land animals
To survive, they were forced to tackle the ocean
This male must graze as quickly as he can
In these chilling waters, his body temperature falls fast a 10-minute dive is about the most he can manage before his muscles seize up
Fighting the surge back to the shore is a Herculean task
And to make matters worse, he must now run the gauntlet of sea lions
They are the last thing the iguana needs
No harm is meant it's nothing more than a rather one-sided game of cat and mouse
Marine iguanas take in too much salt with their food
But with the help of special glands they sneeze it out
They also welcome these resourceful visitors
Sally light foot crabs like to groom them for algae, parasites and dead skin
Lava lizards, far smaller reptilian relatives have found their own ingenious ways to get by on this fierce shoreline
They enjoy a special relationship with the sea lions
The lizards rid them of flies which can be a ticklish nuisance
This sea lion accepts these predatory lizards
- both benefit
Survival depends on seizing every opportunity in this volcanic wasteland
Fernandina is the youngest of all the main Galapagos islands
It may have raised its head above the waves as recently as 30,000 years ago
It sits right above the volcanic hotspot in the far west of the archipelago
But how is it that the other islands created at this same hotspot are now scattered over hundreds of miles of ocean to the east
All the islands are moving
They're traveling southeast at an inch or two a year on a massive tectonic plate which continually slides over the hotspot
Their journey begins as soon as they are born
And in their wake, new islands emerge
It's like a geological conveyer belt
So the archipelago we see today is just a snapshot in time
The oldest islands are in the east the youngest in the west
And as Fernandina ages, it will be carried on this conveyer belt to where the biggest of all the Galapagos islands currently resides
- Isabela
It's shaped like a giant sea horse, almost 100 miles long with a backbone of volcanos
Isabela is a teenage Galapagos island nearing a million years old time enough for life to settle
It's giant calderas still tower more than a mile above sea level and are draped in vegetation
Although Isabela is softening with age it's still close enough to the hotspot to remain active
On its summits, like here on Alcedo volcano live the most iconic of all Galapagos animals
Their ancient trails carved over tens of thousands of years scar the landscape
Giant tortoises
They are the largest of their kind in the world weighing up to 550 pounds
Water is a scarce resource on this island and giant tortoises can survive months without it
But during the wetter season they gather to quench their thirst among a scattering of freshwater pools
A tortoise oasis
Around 5000 live here on Alcedo it's the greatest concentration found anywhere in Galapagos
Despite their extensive body armor, tortoises are vulnerable to skin parasites which they are unable to remove themselves so that they've developed a remarkable relationship with finches
When they need service it's a sort of slow motion pit stop
A finch eating frenzy
This giant tortoise could live to be 150 years old
During his lifetime, the island he roams
- Isabela will be transported about 20 feet southeast on the Galapagos conveyer belt
But a million years from now that's about 6,000 tortoise lifetimes
Isabela will be carried right to the heart of the Galapagos archipelago to where these mature mid-aged islands now lie
Santa Cruz has been pulled so far from the hotspot, but its volcanos are now ancient ruins worn by the passage of time and swallowed by forest
Plants and soils now cover this aging island teeming with life
Its peaks are still high enough to generate clouds and receive regular rainfall
It's one of few places in Galapagos where there're magical freshwater pools
After a morning spent foraging at sea, frigate birds come here to bath their feathers and to sip on the wing
These forest basins are created by layer on layer of rich volcanic soil packed over porous lava
Elsewhere, the water filters its way through to reemerge near the coast in brackish lagoons
They are home to the most unlikely Galapagos residents
chance immigrants from the Caribbean
There are only about 500 flamingos in Galapagos limited to this rare habitat

What's wrong with her?
Oh, don't worry about it, honey.
Let's just go inside...
- Is Ellen mad, Mama?
- Is she mad?
Uh, yeah.
Why?
She's just a little bit upset... about racism.
Don't worry about it, baby.
Just go to your room.
- Okay?
I'll be right in.
- Okay.
I did not expect that from Walter and Ellen!
I mean, that is some loud sex!
I know.
Jesus.
How come you don't sound like that when we have sex?
Yeah, what about that?
"Lucky Louie" was taped before a live audience.
What are you doing?
I'm fucking you.
Just relax.
Relax.
It's kinda taking a long time.
Yes, it is.
Louie honey, it's okay.
We're trying to get pregnant.
Just wrap it up.
Relax.
Oh, I know what this is.
Are you trying to make me scream like Ellen?
Louie honey,
I just got off a double shift.
Seriously, release the doves.
All right, I'll come.
I appreciate that.
Hey, how's it going, Walter?
- Fine.
- Ellen and Lisa?
We're good.
Hey, cool trash can.
Look, I'm sorry to ask you this.
It's none of my business.
I shouldn't be asking you this, but... what are you doing to make Ellen so happy in there?
Excuse me?
Sorry, just... you guys seem to be having a great time lately, and I'm interested in, you know, tips, pointers, kinda... for Kim, for me for Kim.
What are you talking about?
Come on, man, whatever you're doing in there,
Ellen is loving it.
I mean, we can all hear her moaning through the walls all week.
I've been out of town since last Thursday.
Did you have a good trip?
Was...
- Hey, Rich.
- Hey, Lou.
- You got a package for me?
- Yeah, we got your package.
Look, man, are you having drugs sent to our house?
'Cause don't do that.
- Have 'em mailed to your own house.
- I can't.
My mom opens my mail.
Anyway, this isn't drugs.
It's urine.
So, you're a piss dealer now?
I sell clean piss as an added convenience for my drug customers.
This piss... is liquid gold.
Well, don't have it sent to my house, okay?
What is that?
It's Ellen.
Ooh, that Walter sounds like a master cocksman.
Apparently, it ain't Walter.
- Ellen's cheating on him.
- That's reprehensible.
Ooh, you like that, you little whore.
What is that guy doing to her?
He's destroying her.
Oh, shit!
Yeah, but what is he doing?
At first I was gonna go with doggy-style, but you know what?
I think it might be classic missionary, but on a hard surface.
You can hear him compressing her ribcage.
And there's definitely ass play involved.
- And she's blowing him.
- Mmm mmm!
Wait a minute.
He's fucking her and she's blowing him?
That's physically impossible.
Well, for you.
Oh my God.
Poor Walter.
That guy never had a chance.
Walter's just the beginning.
A guy with a skill set like that running around... if Kim's pussy hears about this it's over for you.
- Bye-bye, Rich.
- Whatever.
I'll be out here for a couple minutes.
Yeah, suck it, Ellen.
Yeah, suck my big beautiful black cock.
We have something to talk about.
What's that, Walter?
What's been going on here while I'm away?
What are you talking about?
What am I talking about?
You know what I'm talking about.
I really don't know.
Well, the whole building is talking about it.
The neighbors can hear you screaming through the walls.
- Who hears me?
- Louie.
Oh, that man needs to get himself a job and stop listening to other people's business.
Ellen... who are you fucking when I'm not around?
You'd better say something.
Huh?
Huh?
Right?
- Did you just yawn?
- No.
Honey, look.
I'm ovulating.
Let's just do this.
It's gonna be good.
Just watch.
Can I watch from over there?
Louie...
Wait.
Mmm!
That's kind of interesting.
Holy shit.
Good, right?
Holy shit.
That was amazing.
That's never happened before.
Pretty intense, huh?
No, I mean that has never happened before.
Well, you're welcome.
I think I just had my first orgasm.
What?
Come on, you've had orgasms before.
Well, I thought I had.
It seemed like you were having orgasms.
Yeah, I thought I was.
It would always feel really good at the end, but nothing like this.
This was so much better.
I had no idea.
I mean, I always thought those big female orgasms were bullshit, like in the movies.
I just never realized it could be more like...
So ain't that some shit?
Yeah, right?
I mean, you were trying all this different stuff, and I don't know what happened, but all of a sudden it's like...
That's right.
I did it.
I made you scream, and not only that,
I changed your life.
Yeah, and it only took you seven years.
Oh, yeah.
It's okay.
I'm glad it happened.
You did a good job, honey.
You go get yourself a treat from the fridge.
I thought you might be needing this stuff.
Wow, look at all of these.
Thanks, Tina, but I think it's a little early for swapping baby clothes.
I'm not even pregnant.
Hey, you're trying, right?
That means it's your turn to keep all this shit at your house.
Oh my God.
Lucy used to sleep in this all the time.
- Ooh!
- Yeah.
Everything okay, slugger?
Well... something happened last night.
I had this orgasm that was like,
"Jesus!" You know?
But that's not the weird part.
The weird part is I think it was my first.
No, I mean that.
- I've never had an orgasm before.
- Oh, I knew that.
- What?
- I knew that you weren't coming.
No, you didn't.
How could you possibly know that?
I don't know.
It's obvious.
The way you walk.
Everything, you know?
You're very un-coming.
But hey, you unlocked your box.
Good for you.
This is so fucked up.
I just had my first orgasm at 37?
What does that mean?
It means congratulations.
Start living your life.
You know what they say?
There's no orgasms in heaven.
But all this time has gone by... years and years.
I wanna go back and fuck all my old boyfriends again.
You should.
You deserve it.
No, do what you were doing last time.
I am.
This feels different.
Not to me.
I think your dick was different.
I'm using the same one.
Maybe the angle was different.
All right, all right.
No, that's not right.
I can see your bald spot, and I couldn't see it before.
That's not helping me right now.
Okay, just switch with me.
- Okay.
- Okay.
All right.
Okay.
No no no no no.
You stay still.
Let me try something.
Okay?
Okay.
- Take it easy.
- Stay still!
Don't...
Jeez!
Quit... quit slamming your snatch into me so hard!
You're gonna rip my dick off, you fucking lunatic!
Just forget it.
It's not working anyway.
Good, 'cause... ow!
What did you do?
You have to remember what you did.
Why is it all on me?
Because you were the one doing the fucking.
You fucked me.
You made me come.
You need to do it again.
Well, I don't know what I did.
Let's just try again tomorrow.
Wait a minute.
I didn't finish yet.
Why should you get to finish if I haven't?
Since when is that the rule?
Since I started having orgasms.
And no jerking off!
Nobody's coming in this house tonight.
How was that?
It was great.
Yes, it was.
In fact, I'm thirsty.
It's a nightmare.
I have to make her come, or I don't get to.
Welcome to actual sex.
I hope you enjoyed your free ride.
I've been having sex all week without coming.
- Yeah.
- I'm so backed up I cry come.
I cut myself shaving and come came out.
- When I sweat...
- Hey, stop it, huh?
My back is killing me 'cause we're doing all these angles and positions.
Yeah, well, there's a reason for that.
You're just being too technical about it.
I mean, it's not about what you're doing.
It's about why you did it.
The thought behind the thrust.
You know, like with me, all right?
I'm so lucky to have Tina that all I can think about when we're doing it is
"Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you."
Then all that gratitude pours out of me into her and makes her pop.
So you just think, "Thank you, thank you"?
Yeah.
What were you thinking when you accidentally made your wife come for the first time?
I was thinking...
I was thinking,
"Scream, you fucking bitch!"
Well, there you go.
That's good.
It was aggression.
I guess that's what you need.
You gotta, you know, hate her a little.
Hate her?
A little.
I guess it makes sense.
I mean, she hates me, and I come every time.
How's this?
Yeah, it's good,
I guess, but no.
All right, we're not giving up this time.
I'm gonna try something.
- All right.
- Okay.
You fucking bitch!
What is that, dirty talk?
No, I was trying to recreate where I was mentally in my head
- when you came.
- Really?
So when I had my first orgasm in my entire life, you were thinking, "You fucking bitch"?
Yes, I was.
I'm sorry.
Well, at least you were trying something.
I mean, I don't know what the hell to do.
I'm a 37-year-old nurse with no idea about my own body.
Well, maybe it's not about your body.
Maybe it's in your head.
What were you thinking when you came?
- I don't know.
- Come on, what were you thinking?
I don't know.
In my head there was just like nothing.
Like just an empty room with whiteness.
And what were we doing?
Oh, no, you're not there.
Nobody's there.
No you, no Lucy, no number 8 bus, just nothing.
So in order for you to come, you have to pretend I don't exist?
Yeah, that's it.
Shit!
What?
Well, you came, and I wasn't even in the universe.
I guess that kinda hurts my feelings.
You said "fucking bitch," and I'm fine.
She wasn't cheating on me.
- What?
- You heard me.
Yes, I did.
I find it offensive that you assume Ellen is cheating on me just because she's making loud sexual noises when I'm out of town.
Sorry.
How am I supposed to compete with a big piece of vibrating plastic?
Goddamn made-in-China motherfucker!
Yeah, well, the only way Kim can have an orgasm is if she pretends I don't even exist, and she's in an empty room alone in the universe.
Wow.
Why is it so complicated?
You know, back in my daddy's day, all they did was make love to their wives or not.
It wasn't all this.
I know.
So why's it so much harder for us now?
I guess because... they didn't care whether their wives came or not.
Right.
They really were "the greatest generation."
- Lucy's asleep.
- Okay.
I just started my period.
- Yeah?
- Yep.
So no baby this month.
Well, good.
I don't think we should have another baby yet.
- You should go back on the pill.
- What?
You need to be having regular, frequent, sustainable orgasms, just like me.
Oh, Louie, no.
Look,
I mean, let's stop worrying about all this coming stuff.
I mean, I know I was wound up about it, but it's too much pressure.
I'll just repress my memory of that orgasm.
Please, I was fine with the way it was before... you'd come fast, and I'd get to watch my shows.
No.
That's unacceptable.
We're gonna figure this out.
I promise you with God as my witness we will solve the riddle of your pussy.
- Okay.
- Good.
You sure this isn't just you trying to put off having another baby?
No, this is me just trying to fuck you a lot.
Oh, honey, we don't have to do this.
You know, my period.
No, I want to.
I think it's important we get started immediately.
Please, I haven't come in 10 days.
Okay.
I just came.
Mmm.
Oh my God, Walter.
That was amazing!
That's the best it's been since we've been married.
Glad you liked it.
And where did you get the idea for me to pretend you didn't exist?
Well, I'm thirsty.
What's wrong with her?
Oh, don't worry about it, honey.
Let's just go inside...
- Is Ellen mad, Mama?
- Is she mad?
Uh, yeah.
Why?
She's just a little bit upset... about racism.
Don't worry about it, baby.
Just go to your room.
- Okay?
I'll be right in.
- Okay.
I did not expect that from Walter and Ellen!
I mean, that is some loud sex!
I know.
Jesus.
How come you don't sound like that when we have sex?
Yeah, what about that?
Lucky Louie 1.02 - "Kim's O"
Synchronisation :
Tyno Transcript :
Raceman
"Lucky Louie" was taped before a live audience.
What are you doing?
I'm fucking you.
Just relax.
Relax.
It's kinda taking a long time.
Yes, it is.
Louie, honey, it's okay.
We're trying to get pregnant.
Just wrap it up.
Relax.
Oh, I know what this is.
Are you trying to make me scream like Ellen?
Louie, honey,
I just got off a double shift.
Seriously, release the doves.
All right, I'll come.
I appreciate that.
Hey, how's it going, Walter?
- Fine.
- Ellen and lisa?
We're good.
Hey, cool trash can.
Look, I'm sorry to ask you this.
It's none of my business.
I shouldn't be asking you this, but...
What are you doing to make Ellen so happy in there?
Excuse me?
Sorry, just...

Glad you liked it.
And where did you get the idea for me to pretend you didn't exist?
Well, I'm thirsty.
Leave me alone...
please.
Stop!
In time of mourning.
We find comfort in the words of the psalmists.
The Psalm of David.
The 23rd...
"The Lord is my shepherd:
I shall not want."
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul:
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His Name's sake.
Yea.
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.
I will fear no evil:
for Thou art with me:
Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:
Thou anointest my head with oil:
My cup runneth over.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow thee all the days...
It's gonna rain.
Maybe we should just go home.
The reception is inside.
I don't think weather's gonna be a factor.
Yeah.
It's just seeing everyone after so long... curious Kira...
I said. "Well.
Something's wrong with that guy."
But you guys were friends.
They need you.
That's what matters.
I guess you should go talk to her.
We should talk to her.
Kira.
Well.
Uh... no sign of Sid...
not surprising.
Maybe something came up.
Yeah.
Kinko's must be really busy tonight.
So he doesn't have some big law-firm job.
- He's our friend.
- Ah.
Sid.
- Sid.
- Mm.
Hi.
Sorry I missed Dev's funeral.
It was crazy at work.
We're just glad you could make it.
- Thanks.
Man.
Miss Mitchel.
- Nice to see you.
Sid.
How are you?
Hmm?
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Where were you?
You know...
I'm gonna go.
Why?
!
I just...
I just don't feel comfortable.
- Okay.
Uh.
Let me say goodbye and...
- No no no.
Listen.
I want you to stay.
They're your friends.
They need you.
But uh...
- Are you sure?
- Yeah yeah...
- I'm fine.
- Okay.
Won't be long.
Okay.
Love you.
Love you too.
- Hey.
- Hey.
How have you been?
- Good.
- Nice to see you.
Hello.
It's good to see you guys.
You know.
I really miss hanging out together.
Having a few drinks...
That's 'cause everyone picked up your bill.
I could've claimed you as a dependent in college.
I'm just saying we took care of each other then.
And then we didn't.
Come on.
Guys.
College doesn't last forever.
- You're free to get married.
- You hear that.
Kira?
- We're free to get married.
- I'll keep that in mind.
Okay.
Ahem.
Who's taking me home?
Home?
It's like 8:00.
It's 11:00.
I've got work tomorrow.
Anyways.
This place is closing.
All right.
How about we go someplace else?
- A bar?
- How about a cemetery?
Mm-hmm.
Did I mention I have work tomorrow?
No.
Serious.
Guys.
I mean.
Since I missed Dev's funeral.
I thought it would be cool if we went back.
You know... together.
- Mm-hmm.
- Kira?
I don't know.
It's cold and about to rain.
And a cemetery...
isn't that a little weird?
No.
What's weird is we haven't been in the same room together for years and the best we can do for Dev
- Is to have a few drinks.
- Sid?
You know what?
I didn't miss Dev's funeral because of work.
I just didn't go.
You think Dev would've wanted us sitting around.
Crying over him
- Like this?
- What do you want us to do?
Say goodbye together.
We did that...
it's called a funeral.
I won't expect you to understand.
Guess I'll see you guys the next time one of us dies.
I didn't do anything.
I swear.
- Harris?
- Yeah.
- Hi.
Sid.
- What are you guys doing here?
We're doing what you said...
saying goodbye.
Well.
Let's celebrate.
I got strawberry.
That's what we were afraid of... champagne.
All right.
Let's go.
To Devin.
You'll always be with us.
Dev.
We love you.
Rest in peace.
Dev.
. ' A shadow sits upon your... '
. ' Peace of mind... '
Whoa-whoa.
Easy.
Slow down there.
Man.
You're gonna feel like shit tomorrow.
If I don't take a walk.
I'm gonna pass out.
- Wanna come?
- Yeah.
Oh-hh. look.
Someone left you a card.
Do you mind if I read it?
Allison?
No.
She-she...
she's good.
She supports me.
We have goals.
We're even taking it to the next step.
The next...
Jesus.
Harris Mitchel's gonna be a dad.
Well.
Not yet.
But we're.
Uh...
we're trying.
- That's the best part.
Right?
- Mm.
Uh.
So... does your wife still hate me?
She doesn't hate you.
She's scared of you.
- She doesn't hate you.
- Scared of what?
Well.
Maybe she thinks we got something going on we don't.
Do we?
- Why aren't you stopping me?
- Why aren't you stopping me?
Hey.
Where are you guys?
Oh.
Hey.
There you are.
So.
Guys.
Check this out.
I'm hanging out with Dev and I find this card on his tombstone.
Right?
And I'm... and I'm reading it and I'm like.
"Damn.
This is so what we're about tonight!"
You know.
What we're doing here.
Oh God.
You're gonna break your neck.
Right.
So without further ado.
I'd like to read a few words for Devin and all the other dead people out there tonight.
"O joyful.
O delighted.
O fortunate one!"
Weep no more this departed son.
Read these words and sound thy voice.
Revel and sing!
Rejoice!
Rejoice!
Life's for the living.
Not the dead.
Forget tomorrow.
Live now instead.
This night you breathe.
While they cannot.
"So dance ye soul on their resting spot."
Who's sent that?
It doesn't say.
Boy.
Dance on their resting spot?
- Whoo-whoo!
- Dance on their resting spot.
Whatever.
Man.
I'm saying it's about living for today.
You can't dance on someone's grave.
Don't listen to him.
I think it's cool.
"Rejoice!
Rejoice!"
Life's for the living.
Not the dead.
Forget tomorrow.
Live now instead.
This night you breathe.
While they cannot.
So dance ye soul...
"on their resting spot."
. ' I feel so high at night. '
. ' I wanna take a ride. '
- . ' To the other side... '
- Whoo!
. ' The other side of town.
No need to slow down. '
. ' Then I wake up and I'm all right. '
. ' I was out on her bed.
I said. '
- . ' Ooh.
Baby.
I thought I was dead... '
- Yeah!
Whoo-whoo.
Whoo!
Come on.
Wake up!
Glad I didn't wait up.
I'm sorry... started talking about work.
Life.
Death.
Old times.
Mm.
The usual topics after too much wine.
Way too much.
You know what?
I think I'm gonna skip work today.
You sure they'll be able to practice law?
You haven't missed a day since you've been there.
I'm sure they'll do just fine.
- I'm gonna take a shower.
- Okay.
Oh.
Good morning.
Sammy.
You hungry?
Let's go eat.
What is it.
What is it?
Tsk-tsk.
Sammy.
Hello?
Hello?
I submitted that evidence two weeks ago through Judge Wayan.
Yes yes.
Yes.
I'll be right there.
Did you.
Uh.
Call what's-his-name?
Yesterday.
He said it's an old house with old pipes.
- Then since it's not an emergency...
- Blah blah blah.
- Blah blah blah.
- Love you.
- Love you too.
- See you.
Bye.
- Ahem.
- Hi.
This is Kira.
You know what to do.
Kira.
It's Harris calling you back.
Everything is okay.
Bye.
Hello?
Harris?
Harris?
Harris?
!
Harris?
- Did you hear her?
- Who?
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
Baby.
What's wrong?
What happened that night... after I left the funeral?
I told you... we sat around and talked.
So nothing happened between you and Kira?
Me and Kira?
No!
You know what?
She's been calling ever since that night.
I see her name on the caller ID and when I answer.
- She hangs up.
- Maybe something is wrong.
Of course there's something wrong...
she's back in our life again!
Listen to me.
She's been calling me too.
I haven't seen or heard from her since the funeral.
You've been acting strange since then too.
And then all this... all this stuff around the house started happening.
- The pipes?
- No.
Other things... the doors.
There's tapping.
And... and then there's voices.
I just don't feel safe.
Oh.
Baby.
When did you learn Chopin.
Hon?
Great.
- Hi.
Honey.
- Hey.
Oh.
How's the alarm going?
It's finished.
- Looks good.
- Yeah.
Where are you going?
The cat's talking.
Harris?
He said he loved me.
He said he loved me.
He said... he said he loved me!
Harris?
!
- Harris.
She's in our room.
- Who?
- I don't know.
I don't know... come on!
- No.
- Please please.
I'm scared.
- No.
Harris?
!
Drop it!
Drop the weapon!
Maybe she got in before we went to bed.
How?
The whole house was locked and we were home all night.
Where is she?
Did you find her?
Uh.
No.
Ma'am.
We didn't find anyone.
The alarm was tripped in the living room.
But I didn't see any sign of forced entry.
Well.
She got in somehow.
Has everything been all right here tonight.
Ma'am?
Thank you for your time.
Officer.
Good night.
- I told you... she's doing it again.
- Kira is not stalking us.
You don't seem too convinced I'm wrong.
Why would she?
What she did before was different.
She followed you around.
She showed up at your office.
- She called us at all hours.
- It was right before our wedding.
- It was a hard time for her.
- Bullshit.
You know what?
You didn't believe me then either.
All right.
I'll call her tomorrow.
I refuse to live like this.
We're gonna sort this out... tonight!
Kira?
Whoa.
What are you doing?
- You can't break in there.
- Why not?
She does it to us.
- Where are you going?
- I'm trying the back.
Kira?
God.
It is cold in here.
- Get a flashlight.
- Okay.
Harris.
What is it?
I don't know.
It's writing.
- Oh my God!
- Don't don't.
Call 911!
Ha...
Harris.
Kira?
Dr. Travis.
You have a visitor in the main lobby.
Dr. Travis... a visitor in the main lobby.
Kira Hayden.
We're friends.
We found her.
- Has her family been contacted?
- Is she all right?
I'm waiting on the results of a couple of tests.
But uh.
She should be.
Those markings all over her...
what were those?
Teeth marks.
- God.
- Someone bit her?
And there's also some bleeding indicating a possible... sexual assault.
- Can I see her?
- Sorry.
I'm limiting contact pending a full psych evaluation.
If there's any changes.
I'll let you know.
I'm sorry.
Harris.
Oh.
Well.
Good news is she's not stalking you.
You know what?
That's not fair.
I know.
Sorry.
I'm gonna give Sid a call.
- Hello.
- Uh.
Hi.
- Is this Sid Vance's number?
- Yeah.
Hold on.
Okay.
Oh... hey... oh...
- Sid.
- Hey.
Man.
- Who was that?
- I can't talk right now.
But you gotta come over and check this out.
You're not gonna believe
- What's happening.
- Sid.
Slow down.
Hey.
Doctor?
!
I need a doctor!
Somebody help this person!
Help me!
There was somebody there!
Oh.
God!
There was somebody there!
Let's go.
- Hey.
You guys made it.
- What's going on?
You gotta come check this out.
But be careful when you come in...
- The thermal sensors are on.
- Thermal sensors?
I think I'm being haunted.
Well.
I would not go that far.
Mr. Vance.
Haunting requires some level of paranormal activity.
- Yeah.
Uh.
Sid...
- Who are these people?
- Who are you?
- Vincent Cochet.
And who are you?
These are my friends Harris and Allison.
Thank you.
And this is my assistant...
- Colleague.
- Frances Culpepper.
- They're ghost hunters.
- Paranormal investigators.
We are from the Parapsychology Department at Madison College.
Mr. Vance answered my advertising offering a reward to anyone experiencing a paranormal phenomena... which we have yet to see.
- I got your phenomena.
- Hey!
What makes you think you're being haunted?
Some weird shit's been happening to me.
Man.
I hear noises and footsteps and there's these little fires.
Listen.
We have been here 10 hours and the scariest thing we've seen is your bathroom.
Well.
Maybe that's because you don't know what you're doing.
Or maybe we are investigating the claims of someone whose biggest decision of the day is whether to get drunk or stoned.
Hey.
Why don't you read between the lines?
Okay okay okay.
Can we please maintain some level of scientific environment here?
- These two have been at it all day.
- That's long enough.
- We are gone.
- I think it's happening to us too.
I mean.
I think we're being haunted.
I'm Vincent Cochet.
Paranormal investigator.
Hello.
Do you remember when you first noticed the activities?
Maybe three weeks ago.
Go on.
It started with noises... thumping.
Scratching.
I thought it was the pipes.
But then tonight a woman broke into our house.
I thought it was Kira.
But when I saw her tonight.
I knew it wasn't her.
But there was a woman in the room.
I'm not sure if you are aware.
But your time frame coincides with Mr. Vance's first claim of activities.
Huh?
- Did you see each other at the time?
- Yeah.
Uh... a friend died in a car accident.
- We saw each other at the funeral.
- You didn't tell me
- You went to a funeral.
Mr. Vance.
- I told her.
You told me that you went to a cemetery.
You didn't say anything about a funeral.
'Cause I didn't go to the funeral.
I met them at the reception and then later we went back.
- Back where?
- The cemetery.
- At night?
- Mm-hmm.
What?
Just weird.
That's all.
Did your friend Kira also go back to the cemetery?
Yeah.
She was there.
- Did something happen?
- No.
- I think we should tell him.
- Tell us what?
Yeah.
Tell us what?
Look.
Sid got drunk and pissed on a grave.
Well.
Yeah.
But that's not it.
We also sort of danced.
You what?
You know.
Danced on some graves.
Wait...
I'm sorry.
You danced on graves?
Sid found a card about dancing and.
Yes.
We danced on graves... big deal.
What card?
Do you still have it?
I don't even remember getting home that night.
I'm not sure if you are aware of the possible ramifications of...
We didn't do anything.
Yeah.
You did... it's called burial desecration.
Yes.
Get the camera.
Hey.
Check this out.
Hasn't done that before.
2:10 a.
M...
Mr. Vance's apartment.
Witnessing what I suspect to be a low level of a spectral manifestation of a child's burning footprints.
It's not spectral.
Is this reward cash or check?
I spoke to the nurse at the hospital.
She said she's keeping an eye on Kira.
- The best place for her.
- Yeah.
I just hope these people from the college can help.
They said they were experts.
And did you guys see all that equipment?
- And besides they...
- Have a really creepy house.
- I'm Vincent Cochet.
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh.
Hello.
- Nice house.
Thank you.
It was left by a wealthy alumnus who committed his life to parapsychology study.
We're being taped?
Experiments are conducted throughout the house...
- In case anything happens.
- "Happens"?
Evidence of the paranormal is the Holy Grail.
Please.
So its origin is not clear.
But the verse was obviously intended as a celebration of life.
By dancing on graves?
It's a common practice amongst pagan religions:
Druidism.
Satanism.
Wicca.
They sort of all embrace this "live-for-the-moment" philosophy.
What has us concerned is the following verse.
Uh.
The gravedancers' lament.
"O Fool.
O Lout.
O Unfortunate one."
The dead now mocked.
Their time has come.
Heed these words for souls do roam
And though be dead follow you home.
Its rage will swell as nights grow bright.
Despair and fear.
This fatal plight.
From moon to moon.
You'll have this guest
"To seal thy fate and lay you at rest."
Scary.
Huh?
What you found.
My friend.
Wasn't a simple rhyme celebrating life.
It was a spell.
A curse.
How does a curse get on a bereavement card?
Well.
Dangerous occult mediums are fairly commonplace... tarot cards.
Ouija boards.
That sort of thing.
Sounds like a lawsuit to me.
You're shitting me?
By dancing on a grave... what?
We pissed off a ghost?
Three...
one for each grave.
How do we end it?
There's gotta be a gravedancers' cure or something.
Right?
No... none that we are aware of.
So we're gonna be haunted forever?
The curse lasts from moon to moon... one month...
one month.
It's already been over three weeks.
It will persist until the final moment of the final night.
Or...
- Or what?
!
- Until you're laid to rest.
You mean until we're killed?
Well.
The curse is tied to the lunar cycle and moon to moon.
Uh...
"Its rage will swell as night grows bright."
So the closer we get to the full moon.
The more severe the hauntings will become.
You're saying we're all gonna end up like Kira?
According to the lament.
Yes.
If we can identify the graves you danced on.
Then... get some idea of who these people were... it may help us to keep you safe.
Which is why we need you to take us to Cresent View Cemetery.
- Screw that.
I'm not going back there.
- Not a good idea.
If we don't.
There is no way of knowing what could be coming next... no way.
Kira Hayden?
He's here.
He's here.
- Who's here?
- Get out of here.
Let me help.
Come on.
Don't touch me.
He hates when other people touch me.
Get out of here!
Oh.
God.
Get out of here.
No!
Don't touch her!
Stop it!
Don't touch her!
No!
Please!
No!
No!
No!
I don't get it... you'd think ghosts would dig hanging out from moon to moon.
- Why are they so pissed?
- The curse pulled them in from the other side...
maybe it hurt.
Whatever the reason.
Mr. Vance.
They clearly don't dig it.
Mm-hmm... "dig it."
What are you saying?
That if I danced on John Perez's grave.
We'd get haunted?
What about Mother Teresa?
Like.
You can't just decide to be haunted.
There's more to it than that.
There's spirit.
There's state of mind.
That sort of thing.
Yeah.
But why wait?
Why not just kill us now?
Who says they are not trying?
Maybe they are not strong enough yet.
Yeah.
Tell that to Kira.
This is it...
this is the spot.
Yeah.
This looks familiar.
- Oh.
You gotta be joking.
- I'm not joking.
This area is designated for the city's undesirables... the murderers.
The rapists.
The mentally-ill.
The socially unacceptable.
Found it.
Are you sure this is yours?
Positive.
What about Kira's?
Kira was dancing... well.
Next to me.
To my left.
It's gotta be it here.
Yeah.
Definitely... this is the... this is it...
the tree.
I remember the tree.
I'm afraid your friend is in trouble.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I tried calling.
But he wouldn't let me.
I tried.
It's okay.
We're here for you.
They said you and Allison found me.
Yeah.
You scared us.
We heard someone tried to attack you and a nurse.
It's not what you think.
I know.
Kira.
Um... you're not the only one having these experiences.
Yeah.
We're being haunted too.
It's because of that night in the cemetery.
- Isn't it?
- Yeah.
We've met some people who are trying to help us.
- Once we work this out...
- I'm not staying here.
You have to.
This is the best place for you.
You'll have security.
The whole thing.
- I'm going with you.
- No.
You have to stay.
I'm going with you.
What we have found sheds some lights on your experiences.
- This is Dennis?
- Yes.
That's a happy-looking kid.
Born October 5th. 1948.
To Robert and Claire Faberly.
Dennis was a quiet sickly child with an unfortunate affinity for fire.
By age five.
He'd set numerous minor blazes and ended up burning down his father's feed store.
It's believed he started the blaze which accidentally burned down his house in 1956.
Killing Dennis.
His two siblings and his parents.
But if it was an accident.
Why is he buried in the psycho section of the graveyard?
Well.
The locals didn't think it was an accident.
Uh.
Emma Westbrook:
a well-liked and respected high-school music teacher.
In 1923. she began an affair with a married man named Theodore Gusford...
- How do you know that?
- A confession to the police.
And after Theo ended the affair.
Emma was so distraught that she broke into his house and killed his wife.
- She killed someone?
- With an ax.
And then she waited for him to come back and killed him.
When the police found her.
She was sitting in Gusford's living room.
Covered in blood.
Playing the piano.
Okay.
Kira.
Um... the grave you danced on had "good riddance" on the stone and for...
for good reason.
The person buried there was William Langer.
Don't I get a picture?
He was a judge?
And by all accounts an outstanding citizen.
Uh.
A churchgoing guy.
Family man.
Charitable.
When he died in 1890.
The.
Uh... the town was gonna set up a memorial until they found his journals.
What kind of journals?
Personal ones... sort of detailing his appetite for bizarre sexual exploits.
Sadomasochism.
Self-mutilation.
Tortures... and then there was this.
She was found dead in Langer's basement... she was in a cage.
Wow.
You sure know how to pick them.
We head back to my house.
Wait it out.
A few days from now life returns to normal.
I don't have a few days.
That bastard's getting stronger.
I can feel it.
They are all getting stronger and the lament is quite clear...
"To seal thy fate and lay you at rest."
I'm afraid you can't wait it out.
Why did you call us down here?
To tell me that I'm gonna be killed by a piano teacher?
No.
Ax-murdering piano teacher.
We called you here to tell you that we may have found the solution.
There was this documented case of the lament in 1935.
The victim did something and it ended the curse.
What?
Um.
Well.
It's um... it's a little extreme.
"A little extreme"?
Burial desecration is the root of your problems.
You rebury the body.
The curse is over.
Well...
I need to keep an eye on the others.
What?
!
I have to do this alone?
Hey.
Just slide him in.
Make sure you get every single piece.
Ugh.
Ugh!
Hey.
Jesus.
You scared the shit out of me.
Make sure you get every single piece.
- Why?
- If not.
This is all for nothing.
Go away.
Okay.
- Every single piece.
- Okay.
Ugh.
Pay dirt.
That's disgusting.
Kira.
Help me.
Culpepper.
Help me!
Help help help!
I'm coming.
Kira.
Coming!
Help!
- Help!
- Hang in there.
Kira!
Pull harder.
Culpepper.
Help me.
Oh my God!
Here we go.
Culpepper.
Put it out.
Oh my God.
I'm trying.
Hey.
Someone's coming!
- Let's get out of here!
- Let's go.
Move it!
Get out quick!
"The Lord is my shepherd:
I shall not want."
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures...
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul...
He leadeth me in the path of righteousness for His Name's sake.
Yea.
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.
I will fear no evil...
- That's it?
- Yeah.
- That's it?
- Yes.
Careful with yourself now.
I know.
It's a relief.
- Kind of.
- Yeah.
Everything seems all right.
Yeah.
It is all right.
I don't know how I know.
But it is.
You hear that?
Allison.
There's someone in the house.
Oh my God!
Oh my God.
They're in the house!
Oh my God.
What?
We'll be right there.
Are you okay?
This shit ain't over.
- Is everybody okay?
- No thanks to you.
We did what you said...
we dug up the bodies.
It didn't work.
I know you are disappointed.
But.
You know.
We should remain calm.
We also clearly stated that it might not work.
You didn't say anything about it pissing them off even more.
I don't believe the entities are any more angry.
- Really?
And how would you know?
- We are doing the best we can.
This is not a precise science.
Okay.
All right.
Look.
The bottom line is.
We need to keep you safe and the best way to do that is to keep everybody together.
Stick together so we can do what?
Come inside and I'll tell you.
Fuck that.
Where would you go.
Mr. Mitchel?
Sid?
Harris.
Please.
It's not time to be alone.
Mr. Mitchel.
Frances.
Mm?
What are we looking at?
I don't recall seeing the fence from here.
The school probably cut the trees back.
Well.
Maybe.
What's the plan now?
Sit in a circle.
Hold hands and chat?
We... we... we wait.
- We wait?
- It's the final night of the curse and.
Uh... tomorrow.
The second the sun rises.
It'll all be over.
- You said we couldn't wait it out.
- Yes.
It's true.
- There was no indication...
- That survival isn't possible if we stick it out.
Yeah.
No.
We're not staying.
Let's go.
- Please.
- Just like that.
Huh?
Do the math.
Kira.
We'd rather take our chances alone with Emma.
See.
Kira.
What'd I tell you?
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You bailing is just so typical.
I can't risk Allison.
So you're leaving because of her?
Why shouldn't he?
I didn't let anyone talk me into... dancing on graves!
I didn't talk anybody into anything.
And.
Besides.
If you hadn't left Harris at the wake.
- Maybe things would've been different.
- This is my fault?
- I'm just saying.
- Sid.
Shut up.
Fuck you.
Harris.
If she'd been around.
Granted it would've sucked.
But we wouldn't have gotten drunk.
We wouldn't have danced on graves.
And you sure as hell wouldn't have made out with Kira.
Is that...
is that true.
Harris?
Is it?
- Can we talk?
- Sure.
This is going to be a long night.
Vincent.
They shouldn't be alone.
They're not.
Do you have another one of those?
Allison.
About that night in the cemetery...
Do you still love Harris?
Yes.
- But he doesn't love me.
- How do you know?
He wants to have a family with you.
I'm a memory.
He still cares about you.
And I still care about him.
But... what you guys have is entirely different.
He loves you so much... he told me so that night in the cemetery.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I'm so over Harris.
Anyway... maybe you haven't heard.
But...
I got a new man in my life.
Tsk.
- They are just talking.
- Mm.
Huh-uh... calm before the storm.
She made out with her husband.
We kissed:
we didn't make out.
Don't even try to pull that shit.
I saw you!
Why don't we talk about the real reason that kiss pissed you off?
- And what's that?
- You're in love with Kira.
- What?
!
- Yeah.
You loved her since college.
But you've always been too chickenshit to do anything about it.
Jesus.
Sid.
You can't even admit it now.
Right.
It's just so typical of you to use these cheap lawyer tactics to turn the attention on me when you're the one cheating on his wife.
You know that's not true.
Nothing is ever your fault.
Right.
Harris?
I'm not the one wasting my life.
I'm not wasting my life.
I have what I choose to have.
- Yeah.
Everything except Kira.
- Shut up.
Man.
Stop.
Get off me!
Run!
Is it him?
It's Langer!
I see her...
she's running upstairs.
Fuck you.
You fucking bastard!
Let me go.
Let me go.
You bastard!
Help!
Please... bastard.
Let me go!
No!
Help me.
Oh.
She's losing too much blood.
It's gonna be okay.
Sweetie.
We'll get you out.
It's gonna be okay.
Open the door!
Open the door!
Uh.
I'm sorry.
Guys.
Could you... give me a minute?
Have you found a way out?
The gate is wrapped around the entire house.
And still no signal?
And phone out there too.
Where's Culpepper?
I'm not sure.
Frances?
I am so sorry.
Vincent.
It's not your fault.
We knew the dangers if they stayed here.
You can't blame yourself.
You need to understand.
Understand what?
Yeah... understand what.
Culpepper?
Okay.
I...
I needed the evidence.
I couldn't let it end.
- Tell me those are not...
- We buried those!
I took them out of the bag.
How could you do that?
How could you do that?
!
I'm so sorry.
Vincent.
I just...
I needed the house and the cameras.
I had to document that there was a haunting.
Look.
I knew I could end it.
All right?
There's an open grave outside.
We just...
we've gotta put the skull in it.
How do we do that?
!
How do we get out of this house?
I don't know.
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.
I just...
I just...
I just needed the evidence.
Evidence.
Harris?
Harris!
No no no!
Oh.
God!
Do you have any idea of what you're doing?
Stop it!
This should've been all over.
How are we gonna bury these?
We can't get outside.
There has to be a way out.
Come on!
- I can't get it.
- Welded shut.
You just can't get good paranormal help these days.
Look.
Harris.
I'm sorry.
Man.
I didn't mean to say those things.
I'm sorry too.
- We didn't find anything.
- Does she have to be here?
- I can still help.
- Unless you have dynamite for the bars.
- Nobody wants your help.
- I know you're angry.
- But now it's not the time.
- When is the time?
'Cause the sun rises in less than an hour.
Then it's best not to waste it fighting with each other!
You'd better hope that little pyro gets me. 'cause I swear if I make it...
What?
The flashlights are in the hallway.
What what?
Wasn't Kira in this room?
I locked this door.
Oh my God!
What?
That's Emma's song.
I'm not going anywhere unless something's chasing me.
Stay here.
Oh.
God!
What am I looking at?
Uh.
I-I don't know.
Kira was dead.
She was dead.
Maybe she wasn't.
Maybe...
No no no.
She is.
She is dead.
Then how do you explain that?
Kira?
- Kira?
- Harris?
I don't know if that's a good idea.
Man.
Kira?
Kira?
Emma?
Help!
Bitch!
Help!
- What the hell happened to her?
- I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
You're the expert.
Wait wait wait...
do you guys smell smoke?
I think she's gone.
- Go!
Go!
- Wait.
Go!
Come on!
Come on!
- Vincent.
Move!
Let's go!
- Let's go!
Go.
Vincent!
Hey!
Hey!
Damn it!
Light.
Okay.
Fire extinguisher...
I gotta get a fire extinguisher...
Fire extinguisher.
Oh.
Man.
Help!
Help!
Let me out!
Help!
Let me out!
He's in here!
Let me out!
Get away!
Stay away!
Harris.
- Harris!
- Sid?
No!
No!
- Vincent?
- It's too late.
Go!
Allison.
The window!
- I don't wanna go.
- Great.
No bars!
- Come on!
- I don't wanna go...
No.
You have to do this!
Go!
- I don't wanna go without you.
- You can do this.
You'll be fine!
- I love you.
Harris!
- Go!
- I love you.
I love you.
- I love you too.
- No!
- Please.
I love you.
Harris.
Whoa!
Oh.
God!
Get in.
Get in!
Go!
Go... go!
Allison.
Go!
Go!
Harris!
Back to hell!
Harris!
Harris!
Harris!
Good Lord help me!
- Where the fuck is he?
- Harris!
Oh my God!
It's over.
Could anyone bring me to the hospital?
I need an ambulance.
What is it?
Nothing.
Just the caretaker.
Leave me alone...
please.
Stop!
In time of mourning.
we find comfort in the words of the psalmists.
The Psalm of David.
the 23rd...
"The Lord is my shepherd:
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul:
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His Name's sake.
Yea.
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.
I will fear no evil:
for Thou art with me:
Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:
Thou anointest my head with oil:
My cup runneth over.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow thee all the days...
It's gonna rain.
Maybe we should just go home.
The reception is inside.
I don't think weather's gonna be a factor.
Yeah.
It's just seeing everyone after so long...
Kira is Kira...
And Sid, Well.
Something's wrong with that guy.
But you guys were friends.
They need you.
That's what matters.
I guess you should go talk to her.
We should talk to her.
Kira.
Well.
Uh... no sign of Sid...
not surprising.
Maybe something came up.
Yeah.
Kinko's must be really busy tonight.
So he doesn't have some big law-firm job.
- He's our friend.
- Ah.
Sid.
- Sid.
- Mm.
Hi.
Sorry I missed Dev's funeral.
It was crazy at work.
We're just glad you could make it.
- Thanks.
Man.
Miss Mitchel.
- Nice to see you.
Sid.
How are you?
Hmm?
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Where were you?
You know...
I'm gonna go.
Why?
!
I just...
I just don't feel comfortable.
- Okay.
Uh.
Let me say goodbye and...
- No no no.
Listen.
I want you to stay.
They're your friends.
They need you.
But uh...
- Are you sure?
- Yeah yeah...
- I'm fine.
- Okay.
Won't be long.
Okay.
Love you.
Love you too.
- Hey.
- Hey.
How have you been?
- Good.
- Nice to see you.
Hello.
It's good to see you guys.
You know.
I really miss hanging out together.
Having a few drinks...
That's 'cause everyone picked up your bill.
I could've claimed you as a dependent in college.
I'm just saying we took care of each other then.
And then we didn't.
Come on.
Guys.
college doesn't last forever.
- You're free to get married.
- You hear that.
Kira?
- We're free to get married.
- I'll keep that in mind.
Okay.
Ahem.
Who's taking me home?
Home?
It's like 8:00.
It's 11:00.
I've got work tomorrow.
Anyways.
This place is closing.
All right.
How about we go someplace else?
- A bar?
- How about a cemetery?
Mm-hmm.
Did I mention I have work tomorrow?
No.
Serious.
Guys.
I mean.
since I missed Dev's funeral.
I thought it would be cool if we went back.
You know... together.
- Mm-hmm.
- Kira?
I don't know.
It's cold and about to rain.
And a cemetery...
isn't that a little weird?
No.
What's weird is we haven't been in the same room together for years and the best we can do for Dev
- Is to have a few drinks.
- Sid?
You know what?
I didn't miss Dev's funeral because of work.
I just didn't go.
You think Dev would've wanted us sitting around.
Crying over him
- Like this?
- What do you want us to do?
Say goodbye together.
We did that...
it's called a funeral.
I don't expect you to understand.
Guess I'll see you guys the next time one of us dies.
I didn't do anything.
I swear.
- Harris?
- Yeah.
- Hi, Sid.
- What are you guys doing here?
We're doing what you said...
saying goodbye.
Well.
Let's celebrate.
I got strawberry.
That's what you were afraid of... champagne.
All right.
Let's go.
To Devin.
You'll always be with us.
Dev.
We love you.
Rest in peace.
Dev.
. ' A shadow sits upon your... '
. ' Peace of mind... '
Whoa-whoa.
Easy.
Slow down there.
Man.
you're gonna feel like shit tomorrow.
If I don't take a walk.
I'm gonna pass out.
- Wanna come?
- Yeah.
Oh-hh. look.
someone left you a card.
Do you mind if I read it?
Allison?
No.
She-she...
she's good.
She supports me.
We have goals.
We're even taking it to the next step.
The next...
Jesus.
Harris Mitchel's gonna be a dad.
Well.
Not yet.
But we're.
Uh...
we're trying.
- That's the best part.
Right?
- Mm.
Uh.
So... does your wife still hate me?
She doesn't hate you.
She's scared of you.
- She doesn't hate you.
- Scared of what?
Well.
maybe she thinks we got something going on we don't.
Do we?
- Why aren't you stopping me?
- Why aren't you stopping me?
Hey.
Where are you guys?
Oh.
Hey.
There you are.
So.
Guys.
Check this out.
I'm hanging out with Dev and I find this card on his tombstone.
Right?
and I'm... and I'm reading it and I'm like.
"Damn.
This is so what we're about tonight!"
You know.
What we're doing here.
Oh God.
You're gonna break your neck.
Right.
So without further ado.
I'd like to read a few words for Devin and all the other dead people out there tonight.
"O joyful.
O delighted.
O fortunate one!
Weep no more this departed son.
Read these words and sound thy voice.
Revel and sing!
Rejoice!
Rejoice!
Life's for the living.
not the dead.
Forget tomorrow.
live now instead.
This night you breathe.
while they cannot.
So dance ye soul on their resting spot. "
Who's sent that?
It doesn't say.
Boy.
Dance on their resting spot?
- Whoo-whoo!
- Dance on their resting spot.
Whatever.
Man.
I'm saying it's about living for today.
You can't dance on someone's grave.
Don't listen to him.
I think it's cool.
"Rejoice!
Rejoice!
Life's for the living.
not the dead.
Forget tomorrow.
live now instead.
This night you breathe.
while they cannot.
So dance ye soul on their resting spot. "
. ' I feel so high at night. '
. ' I wanna take a ride. '
- . ' To the other side... '
- Whoo!
. ' The other side of town.
no need to slow down. '
. ' Then I wake up and I'm all right. '
. ' I was out on her bed.
I said. '
- . ' Ooh.
Baby.
I thought I was dead... '
- Yeah!
Whoo-whoo.
Whoo!
Come on.
Wake up!
Glad I didn't wait up.
I'm sorry... started talking about work.
Life.
Death.
old times.
Mm.
The usual topics after too much wine.
Way too much.
You know what?
I think I'm gonna skip work today.
You sure they'll be able to practice law?
You haven't missed a day since you've been there.
I'm sure they'll do just fine.
- I'm gonna take a shower.
- Okay.
Oh.
Good morning.
Sammy.
You hungry?
Let's go eat.
What is it.
What is it?
Tsk-tsk.
Sammy.
Hello?
Hello?
I submitted that evidence two weeks ago through Judge Wayan.
Yes yes.
Yes.
I'll be right there.
Did you.
Uh.
call what's-his-name?
Yesterday.
He said it's an old house with old pipes.
- Then since it's not an emergency...
- Blah blah blah.
- Blah blah blah.
- Love you.
- Love you too.
- See you.
Bye.
- Ahem.
- Hi.
This is Kira.
You know what to do.
Kira.
It's Harris.
I keep seeing your number, but you never leave any messages.
I'm getting worried.
Give me a call at home Ok, bye
Hello?
[woman moaning]
Harris?
Harris?
[woman moaning - grows louder, longer]
Harris?
!
Harris?
!
Harris?
- Did you hear her?
- Who?
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
Baby.
What's wrong?
What happened that night... after I left the funeral?
I told you... we sat around and talked.
So nothing happened between you and Kira?
Me and Kira?
No!
You know what?
She's been calling ever since that night.
I see her name on the caller ID and when I answer.
- She hangs up.
- Maybe something is wrong.
Of course there's something wrong...
she's back in our life again!
Listen to me.
She's been calling me too.
I haven't seen or heard from her since the funeral.
You've been acting strange since then too.
And then all this... all this stuff around the house started happening.
- The pipes?
- No.
Other things... the doors.
There's tapping.
And... and then there's voices.
I just don't feel safe.
Oh.
Baby.
When did you learn Chopin.
Hon?
Great.
- Hi.
Honey.
- Hey.
Oh.
How's the alarm going?
It's finished.
- Looks good.
- Yeah.
Where are you going?
The cat's talking.
Harris?
He said he loved me.
He said he loved me.
He said... he said he loved me!
Harris?
!
- Harris.
She's in our room.
- Who?
- I don't know.
I don't know... come on!
- No.
- Please please.
I'm scared.
- No.
Harris?
!
Drop it!
Drop the weapon!
Maybe she got in before we went to bed.
How?
The whole house was locked and we were home all night.
Where is she?
Did you find her?
Uh.
No.
Ma'am.
we didn't find anyone.
The alarm was tripped in the living room.
but I didn't see any sign of forced entry.
Well.
She got in somehow.
Has everything been all right here tonight.
Ma'am?
Thank you for your time.
Officer.
Good night.
- I told you... she's doing it again.
- Kira is not stalking us.
You don't seem too convinced I'm wrong.
Why would she?
What she did before was different.
She followed you around.
She showed up at your office.
- She called us at all hours.
- It was right before our wedding.
- It was a hard time for her.
- Bullshit.
You know what?
You didn't believe me then either.
All right.
I'll call her tomorrow.
I refuse to live like this.
We're gonna sort this out... tonight!
Kira?
Whoa.
What are you doing?
- You can't break in there.
- Why not?
She does it to us.
- Where are you going?
- I'm trying the back.
Kira?
God.
It is cold in here.
- Get a flashlight.
- Okay.
Harris.
What is it?
I don't know.
It's writing.
- Oh my God!
- Don't don't.
Call 911!
Ha...
Harris.
Kira?
Dr. Travis.
You have a visitor in the main lobby.
Dr. Travis... a visitor in the main lobby.
Kira Hayden.
We're friends.
We found her.
- Has her family been contacted?
- Is she all right?
I'm waiting on the results of a couple of tests.
but uh.
She should be.
Those markings all over her...
what were those?
Teeth marks.
- God.
- Someone bit her?
And there's also some bleeding indicating a possible... sexual assault.
- Can I see her?
- Sorry.
I'm limiting contact pending a full psych evaluation.
If there's any changes.
I'll let you know.
I'm sorry.
Harris.
Oh.
Well.
Good news is she's not stalking you.
You know what?
That's not fair.
I know.
Sorry.
I'm gonna give Sid a call.
- Hello.
- Uh.
Hi.
- Is this Sid Vance's number?
- Yeah.
Hold on.
Okay.
Oh... hey... oh...
- Sid.
- Hey.
Man.
- Who was that?
- I can't talk right now.
but you gotta come over and check this out.
You're not gonna believe
- What's happening.
- Sid.
Slow down.
Hey.
Doctor?
!
I need a doctor!
Somebody help this person!
Help me!
There was somebody there!
Oh.
God!
There was somebody there!
Let's go.
- Hey.
You guys made it.
- What's going on?
You gotta come check this out.
but be careful when you come in...
- The thermal sensors are on.
- Thermal sensors?
I think I'm being haunted.
Well.
I would not go that far.
Mr. Vance.
Haunting requires some level of paranormal activity.
- Yeah.
Uh.
Sid...
- Who are these people?
- Who are you?
- Vincent Cochet.
And who are you?
These are my friends Harris and Allison.
Thank you.
And this is my assistant...
- Colleague.
- Frances Culpepper.
- They're ghost hunters.
- Paranormal investigators.
We are from the Parapsychology Department at Madison College.
Mr. Vance answered my advertising offering a reward to anyone experiencing a paranormal phenomena... which we have yet to see.
- I got your phenomena.
- Hey!
What makes you think you're being haunted?
Some weird shit's been happening to me.
Man.
I hear noises and footsteps and there's these little fires.
Listen.
We have been here 10 hours and the scariest thing we've seen is your bathroom.
Well.
Maybe that's because you don't know what you're doing.
Or maybe we are investigating the claims of someone whose biggest decision of the day is whether to get drunk or stoned.
Hey.
Why don't you read between the lines?
Okay okay okay.
can we please maintain some level of scientific environment here?
- These two have been at it all day.
- That's long enough.
- We are gone.
- I think it's happening to us too.
I mean.
I think we're being haunted.
I'm Vincent Cochet.
paranormal investigator.
Hello.
Do you remember when you first noticed the activities?
Maybe three weeks ago.
Go on.
It started with noises... thumping.
Scratching.
I thought it was the pipes.
But then tonight a woman broke into our house.
I thought it was Kira.
but when I saw her tonight.
I knew it wasn't her.
But there was a woman in the room.
I'm not sure if you are aware.
but your time frame coincides with Mr. Vance's first claim of activities.
Huh?
- Did you see each other at the time?
- Yeah.
Uh... a friend died in a car accident.
- We saw each other at the funeral.
- You didn't tell me
- You went to a funeral.
Mr. Vance.
- I told her.
You told me that you went to a cemetery.
You didn't say anything about a funeral.
'Cause I didn't go to the funeral.
I met them at the reception and then later we went back.
- Back where?
- The cemetery.
- At night?
- Mm-hmm.
What?
Just weird.
That's all.
Did your friend Kira also go back to the cemetery?
Yeah.
She was there.
- Did something happen?
- No.
- I think we should tell him.
- Tell us what?
Yeah.
Tell us what?
Look.
Sid got drunk and pissed on a grave.
Well.
Yeah.
but that's not it.
We also sort of danced.
You what?
You know.
danced on some graves.
Wait...
I'm sorry.
you danced on graves?
Sid found a card about dancing and.
Yes.
We danced on graves... big deal.
What card?
Do you still have it?
I don't even remember getting home that night.
I'm not sure if you are aware of the possible ramifications of...
We didn't do anything.
Yeah.
You did... it's called burial desecration.
Yes.
Get the camera.
Hey.
Check this out.
Hasn't done that before.
2:10 a.
M...
Mr. Vance's apartment.
witnessing what I suspect to be a low level of a spectral manifestation of a child's burning footprints.
It's not spectral.
Is this reward cash or check?
I spoke to the nurse at the hospital.
She said she's keeping an eye on Kira.
- The best place for her.
- Yeah.
I just hope these people from the college can help.
They said they were experts.
And did you guys see all that equipment?
- And besides they...
- Have a really creepy house.
- I'm Vincent Cochet.
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh.
Hello.
- Nice house.
Thank you.
It was left by a wealthy alumnus who committed his life to parapsychology study.
We're being taped?
Experiments are conducted throughout the house...
- In case anything happens.
- "Happens"?
Evidence of the paranormal is the Holy Grail.
Please.
So its origin is not clear.
but the verse was obviously intended as a celebration of life.
By dancing on graves?
It's a common practice amongst pagan religions:
Druidism.
Satanism.
Wicca.
They sort of all embrace this "live-for-the-moment" philosophy.
What has us concerned is the following verse.
Uh.
The gravedancers' lament.
"O Fool.
O Lout.
O Unfortunate one.
The dead now mocked.
their time has come.
Heed these words for souls do roam
And though be dead follow you home.
Its rage will swell as nights grow bright.
Despair and fear.
this fatal plight.
From moon to moon.
you'll have this guest
To seal thy fate and lay you at rest. "
Scary.
Huh?
What you found.
My friend.
wasn't a simple rhyme celebrating life.
It was a spell.
a curse.
How does a curse get on a bereavement card?
Well.
Dangerous occult mediums are fairly commonplace... tarot cards.
Ouija boards.
that sort of thing.
Sounds like a lawsuit to me.
You're shitting me?
By dancing on a grave... what?
We pissed off a ghost?
Three...
one for each grave.
How do we end it?
There's gotta be a gravedancers' cure or something.
Right?
No... none that we are aware of.
So we're gonna be haunted forever?
The curse lasts from moon to moon... one month...
one month.
It's already been over three weeks.
It will persist until the final moment of the final night.
Or...
- Or what?
!
- Until you're laid to rest.
You mean until we're killed?
Well.
The curse is tied to the lunar cycle and moon to moon.
uh...
"Its rage will swell as night grows bright. "
So the closer we get to the full moon.
the more severe the hauntings will become.
You're saying we're all gonna end up like Kira?
According to the lament.
Yes.
If we can identify the graves you danced on.
Then... get some idea of who these people were... it may help us to keep you safe.
Which is why we need you to take us to Cresent View Cemetery.
- Screw that.
I'm not going back there.
- Not a good idea.
If we don't.
There is no way of knowing what could be coming next... no way.
Kira Hayden?
He's here.
He's here.
- Who's here?
- Get out of here.
Let me help.
Come on.
Don't touch me.
He hates when other people touch me.
Get out of here!
Oh.
God.
Get out of here.
No!
Don't touch her!
Stop it!
Don't touch her!
No!
Please!
No!
No!
No!
I don't get it... you'd think ghosts would dig hanging out from moon to moon.
- Why are they so pissed?
- The curse pulled them in from the other side...
maybe it hurt.
Whatever the reason.
Mr. Vance.
they clearly don't dig it.
Mm-hmm... "dig it. "
What are you saying?
That if I danced on John Perez's grave.
we'd get haunted?
What about Mother Teresa?
Like.
You can't just decide to be haunted.
There's more to it than that.
There's spirit.
There's state of mind.
that sort of thing.
Yeah.
But why wait?
Why not just kill us now?
Who says they are not trying?
Maybe they are not strong enough yet.
Yeah.
Tell that to Kira.
This is it...
this is the spot.
Yeah.
This looks familiar.
- Oh.
You gotta be joking.
- I'm not joking.
This area is designated for the city's undesirables... the murderers.
The rapists.
the mentally-ill.
the socially unacceptable.
Found it.
Are you sure this is yours?
Positive.
What about Kira's?
Kira was dancing... well.
Next to me.
to my left.
It's gotta be it here.
Yeah.
Definitely... this is the... this is it...
the tree.
I remember the tree.
I'm afraid your friend is in trouble.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I tried calling.
But he wouldn't let me.
I tried.
It's okay.
We're here for you.
They said you and Allison found me.
Yeah.
You scared us.
We heard someone tried to attack you and a nurse.
It's not what you think.
I know.
Kira.
Um... you're not the only one having these experiences.
Yeah.
We're being haunted too.
It's because of that night in the cemetery.
- Isn't it?
- Yeah.
We've met some people who are trying to help us.
- Once we work this out...
- I'm not staying here.
You have to.
This is the best place for you.
You'll have security.
the whole thing.
- I'm going with you.
- No.
You have to stay.
I'm going with you.
What we have found sheds some lights on your experiences.
- This is Dennis?
- Yes.
That's a happy-looking kid.
Born October 5th. 1948.
to Robert and Claire Faberly.
Dennis was a quiet sickly child with an unfortunate affinity for fire.
By age five.
He'd set numerous minor blazes and ended up burning down his father's feed store.
It's believed he started the blaze which accidentally burned down his house in 1956.
killing Dennis.
his two siblings and his parents.
But if it was an accident.
why is he buried in the psycho section of the graveyard?
Well.
The locals didn't think it was an accident.
Uh.
Emma Westbrook:
a well-liked and respected high-school music teacher.
In 1923. she began an affair with a married man named Theodore Gusford...
- How do you know that?
- A confession to the police.
And after Theo ended the affair.
Emma was so distraught that she broke into his house and killed his wife.
- She killed someone?
- With an ax.
And then she waited for him to come back and killed him.
When the police found her.
she was sitting in Gusford's living room.
covered in blood.
playing the piano.
Okay.
Kira.
Um... the grave you danced on had "good riddance" on the stone and for...
for good reason.
The person buried there was William Langer.
Don't I get a picture?
He was a judge?
And by all accounts an outstanding citizen.
Uh.
A churchgoing guy.
family man.
charitable.
When he died in 1890.
the.
Uh... the town was gonna set up a memorial until they found his journals.
What kind of journals?
Personal ones... sort of detailing his appetite for bizarre sexual exploits.
Sadomasochism.
self-mutilation.
Tortures... and then there was this.
She was found dead in Langer's basement... she was in a cage.
Wow.
You sure know how to pick them.
We head back to my house.
wait it out.
A few days from now life returns to normal.
I don't have a few days.
That bastard's getting stronger.
I can feel it.
They are all getting stronger and the lament is quite clear...
"To seal thy fate and lay you at rest. "
I'm afraid you can't wait it out.
Why did you call us down here?
To tell me that I'm gonna be killed by a piano teacher?
No.
Ax-murdering piano teacher.
We called you here to tell you that we may have found the solution.
There was this documented case of the lament in 1935.
The victim did something and it ended the curse.
What?
Um.
Well.
It's um... it's a little extreme.
"A little extreme"?
Burial desecration is the root of your problems.
You rebury the body.
the curse is over.
Well...
I need to keep an eye on the others.
What?
!
I have to do this alone?
Hey.
just slide him in.
Make sure you get every single piece.
Ugh.
Ugh!
Hey.
Jesus.
You scared the shit out of me.
Make sure you get every single piece.
- Why?
- If not.
This is all for nothing.
Go away.
Okay.
- Every single piece.
- Okay.
Ugh.
Pay dirt.
That's disgusting.
Kira.
Help me.
Culpepper.
Help me!
Help help help!
I'm coming.
Kira.
Coming!
Help!
- Help!
- Hang in there.
Kira!
Pull harder.
Culpepper.
Help me.
Oh my God!
Here we go.
Culpepper.
Put it out.
Oh my God.
I'm trying.
Hey.
Someone's coming!
- Let's get out of here!
- Let's go.
Move it!
Get out quick!
"The Lord is my shepherd:
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures...
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul...
He leadeth me in the path of righteousness for His Name's sake.
Yea.
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.
I will fear no evil...
- That's it?
- Yeah.
- That's it?
- Yes.
Careful with yourself now.
I know.
it's a relief.
- Kind of.
- Yeah.
Everything seems all right.
Yeah.
It is all right.
I don't know how I know.
but it is.
You hear that?
Allison.
There's someone in the house.
Oh my God!
Oh my God.
they're in the house!
Oh my God.
What?
We'll be right there.
Are you okay?
This shit ain't over.
- Is everybody okay?
- No thanks to you.
We did what you said...
we dug up the bodies.
It didn't work.
I know you are disappointed.
but.
You know.
we should remain calm.
We also clearly stated that it might not work.
You didn't say anything about it pissing them off even more.
I don't believe the entities are any more angry.
- Really?
And how would you know?
- We are doing the best we can.
This is not a precise science.
Okay.
All right.
Look.
The bottom line is.
we need to keep you safe and the best way to do that is to keep everybody together.
Stick together so we can do what?
Come inside and I'll tell you.
Fuck that.
Where would you go.
Mr. Mitchel?
Sid?
Harris.
Please.
It's not time to be alone.
Mr. Mitchel.
Frances.
Mm?
What are we looking at?
I don't recall seeing the fence from here.
The school probably cut the trees back.
Well.
Maybe.
What's the plan now?
Sit in a circle.
hold hands and chat?
We... we... we wait.
- We wait?
- It's the final night of the curse and.
Uh... tomorrow.
The second the sun rises.
It'll all be over.
- You said we couldn't wait it out.
- Yes.
It's true.
- There was no indication...
- That survival isn't possible if we stick it out.
Yeah.
No.
We're not staying.
Let's go.
- Please.
- Just like that.
Huh?
Do the math.
Kira.
We'd rather take our chances alone with Emma.
See.
Kira.
what'd I tell you?
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You bailing is just so typical.
I can't risk Allison.
So you're leaving because of her?
Why shouldn't he?
I didn't let anyone talk me into... dancing on graves!
I didn't talk anybody into anything.
And.
Besides.
If you hadn't left Harris at the wake.
- Maybe things would've been different.
- This is my fault?
- I'm just saying.
- Sid.
Shut up.
Fuck you.
Harris.
If she'd been around.
granted it would've sucked.
but we wouldn't have gotten drunk.
we wouldn't have danced on graves.
and you sure as hell wouldn't have made out with Kira.
Is that...
is that true.
Harris?
Is it?
- Can we talk?
- Sure.
This is going to be a long night.
Vincent.
They shouldn't be alone.
They're not.
Do you have another one of those?
Allison.
About that night in the cemetery...
Do you still love Harris?
Yes.
- But he doesn't love me.
- How do you know?
He wants to have a family with you.
I'm a memory.
He still cares about you.
And I still care about him.
But... what you guys have is entirely different.
He loves you so much... he told me so that night in the cemetery.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I'm so over Harris.
anyway... maybe you haven't heard.
But...
I got a new man in my life.
Tsk.
- They are just talking.
- Mm.
Huh-uh... calm before the storm.
She made out with her husband.
We kissed:
we didn't make out.
Don't even try to pull that shit.
I saw you!
Why don't we talk about the real reason that kiss pissed you off?
- And what's that?
- You're in love with Kira.
- What?
!
- Yeah.
You loved her since college.
but you've always been too chickenshit to do anything about it.
Jesus.
Sid.
You can't even admit it now.
Right.
It's just so typical of you to use these cheap lawyer tactics to turn the attention on me when you're the one cheating on his wife.
You know that's not true.
Nothing is ever your fault.
right.
Harris?
I'm not the one wasting my life.
I'm not wasting my life.
I have what I choose to have.
- Yeah.
Everything except Kira.
- Shut up.
Man.
Stop.
Get off me!
Run!
Is it him?
It's Langer!
I see her...
she's running upstairs.
Fuck you.
you fucking bastard!
Let me go.
Let me go.
You bastard!
Help!
Please... bastard.
Let me go!
No!
Help me.
Oh.
She's losing too much blood.
It's gonna be okay.
Sweetie.
We'll get you out.
It's gonna be okay.
Open the door!
Open the door!
Uh.
I'm sorry.
Guys.
could you... give me a minute?
Have you found a way out?
The gate is wrapped around the entire house.
And still no signal?
And phone out there too.
Where's Culpepper?
I'm not sure.
Frances?
I am so sorry.
Vincent.
It's not your fault.
We knew the dangers if they stayed here.
You can't blame yourself.
You need to understand.
Understand what?
Yeah... understand what.
Culpepper?
Okay.
I...
I needed the evidence.
I couldn't let it end.
- Tell me those are not...
- We buried those!
I took them out of the bag.
How could you do that?
How could you do that?
!
I'm so sorry.
Vincent.
I just...
I needed the house and the cameras.
I had to document that there was a haunting.
Look.
I knew I could end it.
All right?
There's an open grave outside.
We just...
we've gotta put the skull in it.
How do we do that?
!
How do we get out of this house?
I don't know.
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.
I just...
I just...
I just needed the evidence.
Evidence.
Harris?
Harris!
No no no!
Oh.
God!
Do you have any idea of what you're doing?
Stop it!
This should've been all over.
How are we gonna bury these?
We can't get outside.
There has to be a way out.
Come on!
- I can't get it.
- Welded shut.
You just can't get good paranormal help these days.
Look.
Harris.
I'm sorry.
Man.
I didn't mean to say those things.
I'm sorry too.
- We didn't find anything.
- Does she have to be here?
- I can still help.
- Unless you have dynamite for the bars.
- Nobody wants your help.
- I know you're angry.
- But now it's not the time.
- When is the time?
'Cause the sun rises in less than an hour.
Then it's best not to waste it fighting with each other!
You'd better hope that little pyro gets me. 'cause I swear if I make it...
What?
The flashlights are in the hallway.
What what?
Wasn't Kira in this room?
I locked this door.
Oh my God!
What?
That's Emma's song.
I'm not going anywhere unless something's chasing me.
Stay here.
Oh.
God!
What am I looking at?
Uh.
I-I don't know.
Kira was dead.
She was dead.
Maybe she wasn't.
Maybe...
No no no.
She is.
She is dead.
Then how do you explain that?
Kira?
- Kira?
- Harris?
I don't know if that's a good idea.
Man.
Kira?
Kira?
Emma?
Help!
Bitch!
Help!
- What the hell happened to her?
- I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
You're the expert.
Wait wait wait...
do you guys smell smoke?
I think she's gone.
- Go!
Go!
- Wait.
Go!
Come on!
Come on!
- Vincent.
Move!
Let's go!
- Let's go!
Go.
Vincent!
Hey!
Hey!
Damn it!
Light.
Okay.
Fire extinguisher...
I gotta get a fire extinguisher...
Fire extinguisher.
Oh.
Man.
Help!
Help!
Let me out!
Help!
Let me out!
He's in here!
Let me out!
Get away!
Stay away!
Harris.
- Harris!
- Sid?
No!
No!
- Vincent?
- It's too late.
Go!
Allison.
The window!
- I don't wanna go.
- Great.
No bars!
- Come on!
- I don't wanna go...
No.
You have to do this!
Go!
- I don't wanna go without you.
- You can do this.
You'll be fine!
- I love you.
Harris!
- Go!
- I love you.
I love you.
- I love you too.
- No!
- Please.
I love you.
Harris.
Whoa!
Oh.
God!
Get in.
Get in!
Go!
Go... go!
Allison.
Go!
Go!
Harris!
Back to hell!
Harris!
Harris!
Harris!
Good Lord help me!
- Where the fuck is he?
- Harris!
Oh my God!
It's over.
Could anyone bring me to the hospital?
I need an ambulance.
What is it?
Nothing.
just the caretaker.
Leave me alone...
please.
Stop!
In time of mourning.
we find comfort in the words of the psalmists.
The Psalm of David.
the 23rd...
"The Lord is my shepherd:
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul:
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His Name's sake.
Yea.
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.
I will fear no evil:
for Thou art with me:
Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:
Thou anointest my head with oil:
My cup runneth over.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow thee all the days...
It's gonna rain.
Maybe we should just go home.
The reception is inside.
I don't think weather's gonna be a factor.
Yeah.
It's just seeing everyone after so long... curious Kira...
I said. "Well.
Something's wrong with that guy. "
But you guys were friends.
They need you.
That's what matters.
I guess you should go talk to her.
We should talk to her.
Kira.
Well.
Uh... no sign of Sid...
not surprising.
Maybe something came up.
Yeah.
Kinko's must be really busy tonight.
So he doesn't have some big law-firm job.
- He's our friend.
- Ah.
Sid.
- Sid.
- Mm.
Hi.
Sorry I missed Dev's funeral.
It was crazy at work.
We're just glad you could make it.
- Thanks.
Man.
Miss Mitchel.
- Nice to see you.
Sid.
How are you?
Hmm?
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Where were you?
You know...
I'm gonna go.
Why?
!
I just...
I just don't feel comfortable.
- Okay.
Uh.
Let me say goodbye and...
- No no no.
Listen.
I want you to stay.
They're your friends.
They need you.
But uh...
- Are you sure?
- Yeah yeah...
- I'm fine.
- Okay.
Won't be long.
Okay.
Love you.
Love you too.
- Hey.
- Hey.
How have you been?
- Good.
- Nice to see you.
Hello.
It's good to see you guys.
You know.
I really miss hanging out together.
Having a few drinks...
That's 'cause everyone picked up your bill.
I could've claimed you as a dependent in college.
I'm just saying we took care of each other then.
And then we didn't.
Come on.
Guys.
college doesn't last forever.
- You're free to get married.
- You hear that.
Kira?
- We're free to get married.
- I'll keep that in mind.
Okay.
Ahem.
Who's taking me home?
Home?
It's like 8:00.
It's 11:00.
I've got work tomorrow.
Anyways.
This place is closing.
All right.
How about we go someplace else?
- A bar?
- How about a cemetery?
Mm-hmm.
Did I mention I have work tomorrow?
No.
Serious.
Guys.
I mean.
since I missed Dev's funeral.
I thought it would be cool if we went back.
You know... together.
- Mm-hmm.
- Kira?
I don't know.
It's cold and about to rain.
And a cemetery...
isn't that a little weird?
No.
What's weird is we haven't been in the same room together for years and the best we can do for Dev
- Is to have a few drinks.
- Sid?
You know what?
I didn't miss Dev's funeral because of work.
I just didn't go.
You think Dev would've wanted us sitting around.
Crying over him
- Like this?
- What do you want us to do?
Say goodbye together.
We did that...
it's called a funeral.
I won't expect you to understand.
Guess I'll see you guys the next time one of us dies.
I didn't do anything.
I swear.
- Harris?
- Yeah.
- Hi.
Sid.
- What are you guys doing here?
We're doing what you said...
saying goodbye.
Well.
Let's celebrate.
I got strawberry.
That's what we were afraid of... champagne.
All right.
Let's go.
To Devin.
You'll always be with us.
Dev.
We love you.
Rest in peace.
Dev.
. ' A shadow sits upon your... '
. ' Peace of mind... '
Whoa-whoa.
Easy.
Slow down there.
Man.
you're gonna feel like shit tomorrow.
If I don't take a walk.
I'm gonna pass out.
- Wanna come?
- Yeah.
Oh-hh. look.
someone left you a card.
Do you mind if I read it?
Allison?
No.
She-she...
she's good.
She supports me.
We have goals.
We're even taking it to the next step.
The next...
Jesus.
Harris Mitchel's gonna be a dad.
Well.
Not yet.
But we're.
Uh...
we're trying.
- That's the best part.
Right?
- Mm.
Uh.
So... does your wife still hate me?
She doesn't hate you.
She's scared of you.
- She doesn't hate you.
- Scared of what?
Well.
maybe she thinks we got something going on we don't.
Do we?
- Why aren't you stopping me?
- Why aren't you stopping me?
Hey.
Where are you guys?
Oh.
Hey.
There you are.
So.
Guys.
Check this out.
I'm hanging out with Dev and I find this card on his tombstone.
Right?
and I'm... and I'm reading it and I'm like.
"Damn.
This is so what we're about tonight!"
You know.
What we're doing here.
Oh God.
You're gonna break your neck.
Right.
So without further ado.
I'd like to read a few words for Devin and all the other dead people out there tonight.
"O joyful.
O delighted.
O fortunate one!
Weep no more this departed son.
Read these words and sound thy voice.
Revel and sing!
Rejoice!
Rejoice!
Life's for the living.
not the dead.
Forget tomorrow.
live now instead.
This night you breathe.
while they cannot.
So dance ye soul on their resting spot. "
Who's sent that?
It doesn't say.
Boy.
Dance on their resting spot?
- Whoo-whoo!
- Dance on their resting spot.
Whatever.
Man.
I'm saying it's about living for today.
You can't dance on someone's grave.
Don't listen to him.
I think it's cool.
"Rejoice!
Rejoice!
Life's for the living.
not the dead.
Forget tomorrow.
live now instead.
This night you breathe.
while they cannot.
So dance ye soul on their resting spot. "
. ' I feel so high at night. '
. ' I wanna take a ride. '
- . ' To the other side... '
- Whoo!
. ' The other side of town.
no need to slow down. '
. ' Then I wake up and I'm all right. '
. ' I was out on her bed.
I said. '
- . ' Ooh.
Baby.
I thought I was dead... '
- Yeah!
Whoo-whoo.
Whoo!
Come on.
Wake up!
Glad I didn't wait up.
I'm sorry... started talking about work.
Life.
Death.
old times.
Mm.
The usual topics after too much wine.
Way too much.
You know what?
I think I'm gonna skip work today.
You sure they'll be able to practice law?
You haven't missed a day since you've been there.
I'm sure they'll do just fine.
- I'm gonna take a shower.
- Okay.
Oh.
Good morning.
Sammy.
You hungry?
Let's go eat.
What is it.
What is it?
Tsk-tsk.
Sammy.
Hello?
Hello?
I submitted that evidence two weeks ago through Judge Wayan.
Yes yes.
Yes.
I'll be right there.
Did you.
Uh.
call what's-his-name?
Yesterday.
He said it's an old house with old pipes.
- Then since it's not an emergency...
- Blah blah blah.
- Blah blah blah.
- Love you.
- Love you too.
- See you.
Bye.
- Ahem.
- Hi.
This is Kira.
You know what to do.
Kira.
It's Harris calling you back.
Everything is okay.
Bye.
Hello?
Harris?
Harris?
Harris?
!
Harris?
- Did you hear her?
- Who?
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
Baby.
What's wrong?
What happened that night... after I left the funeral?
I told you... we sat around and talked.
So nothing happened between you and Kira?
Me and Kira?
No!
You know what?
She's been calling ever since that night.
I see her name on the caller ID and when I answer.
- She hangs up.
- Maybe something is wrong.
Of course there's something wrong...
she's back in our life again!
Listen to me.
She's been calling me too.
I haven't seen or heard from her since the funeral.
You've been acting strange since then too.
And then all this... all this stuff around the house started happening.
- The pipes?
- No.
Other things... the doors.
There's tapping.
And... and then there's voices.
I just don't feel safe.
Oh.
Baby.
When did you learn Chopin.
Hon?
Great.
- Hi.
Honey.
- Hey.
Oh.
How's the alarm going?
It's finished.
- Looks good.
- Yeah.
Where are you going?
The cat's talking.
Harris?
He said he loved me.
He said he loved me.
He said... he said he loved me!
Harris?
!
- Harris.
She's in our room.
- Who?
- I don't know.
I don't know... come on!
- No.
- Please please.
I'm scared.
- No.
Harris?
!
Drop it!
Drop the weapon!
Maybe she got in before we went to bed.
How?
The whole house was locked and we were home all night.
Where is she?
Did you find her?
Uh.
No.
Ma'am.
we didn't find anyone.
The alarm was tripped in the living room.
but I didn't see any sign of forced entry.
Well.
She got in somehow.
Has everything been all right here tonight.
Ma'am?
Thank you for your time.
Officer.
Good night.
- I told you... she's doing it again.
- Kira is not stalking us.
You don't seem too convinced I'm wrong.
Why would she?
What she did before was different.
She followed you around.
She showed up at your office.
- She called us at all hours.
- It was right before our wedding.
- It was a hard time for her.
- Bullshit.
You know what?
You didn't believe me then either.
All right.
I'll call her tomorrow.
I refuse to live like this.
We're gonna sort this out... tonight!
Kira?
Whoa.
What are you doing?
- You can't break in there.
- Why not?
She does it to us.
- Where are you going?
- I'm trying the back.
Kira?
God.
It is cold in here.
- Get a flashlight.
- Okay.
Harris.
What is it?
I don't know.
It's writing.
- Oh my God!
- Don't don't.
Call 911!
Ha...
Harris.
Kira?
Dr. Travis.
You have a visitor in the main lobby.
Dr. Travis... a visitor in the main lobby.
Kira Hayden.
We're friends.
We found her.
- Has her family been contacted?
- Is she all right?
I'm waiting on the results of a couple of tests.
but uh.
She should be.
Those markings all over her...
what were those?
Teeth marks.
- God.
- Someone bit her?
And there's also some bleeding indicating a possible... sexual assault.
- Can I see her?
- Sorry.
I'm limiting contact pending a full psych evaluation.
If there's any changes.
I'll let you know.
I'm sorry.
Harris.
Oh.
Well.
Good news is she's not stalking you.
You know what?
That's not fair.
I know.
Sorry.
I'm gonna give Sid a call.
- Hello.
- Uh.
Hi.
- Is this Sid Vance's number?
- Yeah.
Hold on.
Okay.
Oh... hey... oh...
- Sid.
- Hey.
Man.
- Who was that?
- I can't talk right now.
but you gotta come over and check this out.
You're not gonna believe
- What's happening.
- Sid.
Slow down.
Hey.
Doctor?
!
I need a doctor!
Somebody help this person!
Help me!
There was somebody there!
Oh.
God!
There was somebody there!
Let's go.
- Hey.
You guys made it.
- What's going on?
You gotta come check this out.
but be careful when you come in...
- The thermal sensors are on.
- Thermal sensors?
I think I'm being haunted.
Well.
I would not go that far.
Mr. Vance.
Haunting requires some level of paranormal activity.
- Yeah.
Uh.
Sid...
- Who are these people?
- Who are you?
- Vincent Cochet.
And who are you?
These are my friends Harris and Allison.
Thank you.
And this is my assistant...
- Colleague.
- Frances Culpepper.
- They're ghost hunters.
- Paranormal investigators.
We are from the Parapsychology Department at Madison College.
Mr. Vance answered my advertising offering a reward to anyone experiencing a paranormal phenomena... which we have yet to see.
- I got your phenomena.
- Hey!
What makes you think you're being haunted?
Some weird shit's been happening to me.
Man.
I hear noises and footsteps and there's these little fires.
Listen.
We have been here 10 hours and the scariest thing we've seen is your bathroom.
Well.
Maybe that's because you don't know what you're doing.
Or maybe we are investigating the claims of someone whose biggest decision of the day is whether to get drunk or stoned.
Hey.
Why don't you read between the lines?
Okay okay okay.
can we please maintain some level of scientific environment here?
- These two have been at it all day.
- That's long enough.
- We are gone.
- I think it's happening to us too.
I mean.
I think we're being haunted.
I'm Vincent Cochet.
paranormal investigator.
Hello.
Do you remember when you first noticed the activities?
Maybe three weeks ago.
Go on.
It started with noises... thumping.
Scratching.
I thought it was the pipes.
But then tonight a woman broke into our house.
I thought it was Kira.
but when I saw her tonight.
I knew it wasn't her.
But there was a woman in the room.
I'm not sure if you are aware.
but your time frame coincides with Mr. Vance's first claim of activities.
Huh?
- Did you see each other at the time?
- Yeah.
Uh... a friend died in a car accident.
- We saw each other at the funeral.
- You didn't tell me
- You went to a funeral.
Mr. Vance.
- I told her.
You told me that you went to a cemetery.
You didn't say anything about a funeral.
'Cause I didn't go to the funeral.
I met them at the reception and then later we went back.
- Back where?
- The cemetery.
- At night?
- Mm-hmm.
What?
Just weird.
That's all.
Did your friend Kira also go back to the cemetery?
Yeah.
She was there.
- Did something happen?
- No.
- I think we should tell him.
- Tell us what?
Yeah.
Tell us what?
Look.
Sid got drunk and pissed on a grave.
Well.
Yeah.
but that's not it.
We also sort of danced.
You what?
You know.
danced on some graves.
Wait...
I'm sorry.
you danced on graves?
Sid found a card about dancing and.
Yes.
We danced on graves... big deal.
What card?
Do you still have it?
I don't even remember getting home that night.
I'm not sure if you are aware of the possible ramifications of...
We didn't do anything.
Yeah.
You did... it's called burial desecration.
Yes.
Get the camera.
Hey.
Check this out.
Hasn't done that before.
2:10 a.
M...
Mr. Vance's apartment.
witnessing what I suspect to be a low level of a spectral manifestation of a child's burning footprints.
It's not spectral.
Is this reward cash or check?
I spoke to the nurse at the hospital.
She said she's keeping an eye on Kira.
- The best place for her.
- Yeah.
I just hope these people from the college can help.
They said they were experts.
And did you guys see all that equipment?
- And besides they...
- Have a really creepy house.
- I'm Vincent Cochet.
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh.
Hello.
- Nice house.
Thank you.
It was left by a wealthy alumnus who committed his life to parapsychology study.
We're being taped?
Experiments are conducted throughout the house...
- In case anything happens.
- "Happens"?
Evidence of the paranormal is the Holy Grail.
Please.
So its origin is not clear.
but the verse was obviously intended as a celebration of life.
By dancing on graves?
It's a common practice amongst pagan religions:
Druidism.
Satanism.
Wicca.
They sort of all embrace this "live-for-the-moment" philosophy.
What has us concerned is the following verse.
Uh.
The gravedancers' lament.
"O Fool.
O Lout.
O Unfortunate one.
The dead now mocked.
their time has come.
Heed these words for souls do roam
And though be dead follow you home.
Its rage will swell as nights grow bright.
Despair and fear.
this fatal plight.
From moon to moon.
you'll have this guest
To seal thy fate and lay you at rest. "
Scary.
Huh?
What you found.
My friend.
wasn't a simple rhyme celebrating life.
It was a spell.
a curse.
How does a curse get on a bereavement card?
Well.
Dangerous occult mediums are fairly commonplace... tarot cards.
Ouija boards.
that sort of thing.
Sounds like a lawsuit to me.
You're shitting me?
By dancing on a grave... what?
We pissed off a ghost?
Three...
one for each grave.
How do we end it?
There's gotta be a gravedancers' cure or something.
Right?
No... none that we are aware of.
So we're gonna be haunted forever?
The curse lasts from moon to moon... one month...
one month.
It's already been over three weeks.
It will persist until the final moment of the final night.
Or...
- Or what?
!
- Until you're laid to rest.
You mean until we're killed?
Well.
The curse is tied to the lunar cycle and moon to moon.
uh...
"Its rage will swell as night grows bright. "
So the closer we get to the full moon.
the more severe the hauntings will become.
You're saying we're all gonna end up like Kira?
According to the lament.
Yes.
If we can identify the graves you danced on.
Then... get some idea of who these people were... it may help us to keep you safe.
Which is why we need you to take us to Cresent View Cemetery.
- Screw that.
I'm not going back there.
- Not a good idea.
If we don't.
There is no way of knowing what could be coming next... no way.
Kira Hayden?
He's here.
He's here.
- Who's here?
- Get out of here.
Let me help.
Come on.
Don't touch me.
He hates when other people touch me.
Get out of here!
Oh.
God.
Get out of here.
No!
Don't touch her!
Stop it!
Don't touch her!
No!
Please!
No!
No!
No!
I don't get it... you'd think ghosts would dig hanging out from moon to moon.
- Why are they so pissed?
- The curse pulled them in from the other side...
maybe it hurt.
Whatever the reason.
Mr. Vance.
they clearly don't dig it.
Mm-hmm... "dig it. "
What are you saying?
That if I danced on John Perez's grave.
we'd get haunted?
What about Mother Teresa?
Like.
You can't just decide to be haunted.
There's more to it than that.
There's spirit.
There's state of mind.
that sort of thing.
Yeah.
But why wait?
Why not just kill us now?
Who says they are not trying?
Maybe they are not strong enough yet.
Yeah.
Tell that to Kira.
This is it...
this is the spot.
Yeah.
This looks familiar.
- Oh.
You gotta be joking.
- I'm not joking.
This area is designated for the city's undesirables... the murderers.
The rapists.
the mentally-ill.
the socially unacceptable.
Found it.
Are you sure this is yours?
Positive.
What about Kira's?
Kira was dancing... well.
Next to me.
to my left.
It's gotta be it here.
Yeah.
Definitely... this is the... this is it...
the tree.
I remember the tree.
I'm afraid your friend is in trouble.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I tried calling.
But he wouldn't let me.
I tried.
It's okay.
We're here for you.
They said you and Allison found me.
Yeah.
You scared us.
We heard someone tried to attack you and a nurse.
It's not what you think.
I know.
Kira.
Um... you're not the only one having these experiences.
Yeah.
We're being haunted too.
It's because of that night in the cemetery.
- Isn't it?
- Yeah.
We've met some people who are trying to help us.
- Once we work this out...
- I'm not staying here.
You have to.
This is the best place for you.
You'll have security.
the whole thing.
- I'm going with you.
- No.
You have to stay.
I'm going with you.
What we have found sheds some lights on your experiences.
- This is Dennis?
- Yes.
That's a happy-looking kid.
Born October 5th. 1948.
to Robert and Claire Faberly.
Dennis was a quiet sickly child with an unfortunate affinity for fire.
By age five.
He'd set numerous minor blazes and ended up burning down his father's feed store.
It's believed he started the blaze which accidentally burned down his house in 1956.
killing Dennis.
his two siblings and his parents.
But if it was an accident.
why is he buried in the psycho section of the graveyard?
Well.
The locals didn't think it was an accident.
Uh.
Emma Westbrook:
a well-liked and respected high-school music teacher.
In 1923. she began an affair with a married man named Theodore Gusford...
- How do you know that?
- A confession to the police.
And after Theo ended the affair.
Emma was so distraught that she broke into his house and killed his wife.
- She killed someone?
- With an ax.
And then she waited for him to come back and killed him.
When the police found her.
she was sitting in Gusford's living room.
covered in blood.
playing the piano.
Okay.
Kira.
Um... the grave you danced on had "good riddance" on the stone and for...
for good reason.
The person buried there was William Langer.
Don't I get a picture?
He was a judge?
And by all accounts an outstanding citizen.
Uh.
A churchgoing guy.
family man.
charitable.
When he died in 1890.
the.
Uh... the town was gonna set up a memorial until they found his journals.
What kind of journals?
Personal ones... sort of detailing his appetite for bizarre sexual exploits.
Sadomasochism.
self-mutilation.
Tortures... and then there was this.
She was found dead in Langer's basement... she was in a cage.
Wow.
You sure know how to pick them.
We head back to my house.
wait it out.
A few days from now life returns to normal.
I don't have a few days.
That bastard's getting stronger.
I can feel it.
They are all getting stronger and the lament is quite clear...
"To seal thy fate and lay you at rest. "
I'm afraid you can't wait it out.
Why did you call us down here?
To tell me that I'm gonna be killed by a piano teacher?
No.
Ax-murdering piano teacher.
We called you here to tell you that we may have found the solution.
There was this documented case of the lament in 1935.
The victim did something and it ended the curse.
What?
Um.
Well.
It's um... it's a little extreme.
"A little extreme"?
Burial desecration is the root of your problems.
You rebury the body.
the curse is over.
Well...
I need to keep an eye on the others.
What?
!
I have to do this alone?
Hey.
just slide him in.
Make sure you get every single piece.
Ugh.
Ugh!
Hey.
Jesus.
You scared the shit out of me.
Make sure you get every single piece.
- Why?
- If not.
This is all for nothing.
Go away.
Okay.
- Every single piece.
- Okay.
Ugh.
Pay dirt.
That's disgusting.
Kira.
Help me.
Culpepper.
Help me!
Help help help!
I'm coming.
Kira.
Coming!
Help!
- Help!
- Hang in there.
Kira!
Pull harder.
Culpepper.
Help me.
Oh my God!
Here we go.
Culpepper.
Put it out.
Oh my God.
I'm trying.
Hey.
Someone's coming!
- Let's get out of here!
- Let's go.
Move it!
Get out quick!
"The Lord is my shepherd:
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures...
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul...
He leadeth me in the path of righteousness for His Name's sake.
Yea.
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.
I will fear no evil...
- That's it?
- Yeah.
- That's it?
- Yes.
Careful with yourself now.
I know.
it's a relief.
- Kind of.
- Yeah.
Everything seems all right.
Yeah.
It is all right.
I don't know how I know.
but it is.
You hear that?
Allison.
There's someone in the house.
Oh my God!
Oh my God.
they're in the house!
Oh my God.
What?
We'll be right there.
Are you okay?
This shit ain't over.
- Is everybody okay?
- No thanks to you.
We did what you said...
we dug up the bodies.
It didn't work.
I know you are disappointed.
but.
You know.
we should remain calm.
We also clearly stated that it might not work.
You didn't say anything about it pissing them off even more.
I don't believe the entities are any more angry.
- Really?
And how would you know?
- We are doing the best we can.
This is not a precise science.
Okay.
All right.
Look.
The bottom line is.
we need to keep you safe and the best way to do that is to keep everybody together.
Stick together so we can do what?
Come inside and I'll tell you.
Fuck that.
Where would you go.
Mr. Mitchel?
Sid?
Harris.
Please.
It's not time to be alone.
Mr. Mitchel.
Frances.
Mm?
What are we looking at?
I don't recall seeing the fence from here.
The school probably cut the trees back.
Well.
Maybe.
What's the plan now?
Sit in a circle.
hold hands and chat?
We... we... we wait.
- We wait?
- It's the final night of the curse and.
Uh... tomorrow.
The second the sun rises.
It'll all be over.
- You said we couldn't wait it out.
- Yes.
It's true.
- There was no indication...
- That survival isn't possible if we stick it out.
Yeah.
No.
We're not staying.
Let's go.
- Please.
- Just like that.
Huh?
Do the math.
Kira.
We'd rather take our chances alone with Emma.
See.
Kira.
what'd I tell you?
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You bailing is just so typical.
I can't risk Allison.
So you're leaving because of her?
Why shouldn't he?
I didn't let anyone talk me into... dancing on graves!
I didn't talk anybody into anything.
And.
Besides.
If you hadn't left Harris at the wake.
- Maybe things would've been different.
- This is my fault?
- I'm just saying.
- Sid.
Shut up.
Fuck you.
Harris.
If she'd been around.
granted it would've sucked.
but we wouldn't have gotten drunk.
we wouldn't have danced on graves.
and you sure as hell wouldn't have made out with Kira.
Is that...
is that true.
Harris?
Is it?
- Can we talk?
- Sure.
This is going to be a long night.
Vincent.
They shouldn't be alone.
They're not.
Do you have another one of those?
Allison.
About that night in the cemetery...
Do you still love Harris?
Yes.
- But he doesn't love me.
- How do you know?
He wants to have a family with you.
I'm a memory.
He still cares about you.
And I still care about him.
But... what you guys have is entirely different.
He loves you so much... he told me so that night in the cemetery.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I'm so over Harris.
anyway... maybe you haven't heard.
But...
I got a new man in my life.
Tsk.
- They are just talking.
- Mm.
Huh-uh... calm before the storm.
She made out with her husband.
We kissed:
we didn't make out.
Don't even try to pull that shit.
I saw you!
Why don't we talk about the real reason that kiss pissed you off?
- And what's that?
- You're in love with Kira.
- What?
!
- Yeah.
You loved her since college.
but you've always been too chickenshit to do anything about it.
Jesus.
Sid.
You can't even admit it now.
Right.
It's just so typical of you to use these cheap lawyer tactics to turn the attention on me when you're the one cheating on his wife.
You know that's not true.
Nothing is ever your fault.
right.
Harris?
I'm not the one wasting my life.
I'm not wasting my life.
I have what I choose to have.
- Yeah.
Everything except Kira.
- Shut up.
Man.
Stop.
Get off me!
Run!
Is it him?
It's Langer!
I see her...
she's running upstairs.
Fuck you.
you fucking bastard!
Let me go.
Let me go.
You bastard!
Help!
Please... bastard.
Let me go!
No!
Help me.
Oh.
She's losing too much blood.
It's gonna be okay.
Sweetie.
We'll get you out.
It's gonna be okay.
Open the door!
Open the door!
Uh.
I'm sorry.
Guys.
could you... give me a minute?
Have you found a way out?
The gate is wrapped around the entire house.
And still no signal?
And phone out there too.
Where's Culpepper?
I'm not sure.
Frances?
I am so sorry.
Vincent.
It's not your fault.
We knew the dangers if they stayed here.
You can't blame yourself.
You need to understand.
Understand what?
Yeah... understand what.
Culpepper?
Okay.
I...
I needed the evidence.
I couldn't let it end.
- Tell me those are not...
- We buried those!
I took them out of the bag.
How could you do that?
How could you do that?
!
I'm so sorry.
Vincent.
I just...
I needed the house and the cameras.
I had to document that there was a haunting.
Look.
I knew I could end it.
All right?
There's an open grave outside.
We just...
we've gotta put the skull in it.
How do we do that?
!
How do we get out of this house?
I don't know.
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.
I just...
I just...
I just needed the evidence.
Evidence.
Harris?
Harris!
No no no!
Oh.
God!
Do you have any idea of what you're doing?
Stop it!
This should've been all over.
How are we gonna bury these?
We can't get outside.
There has to be a way out.
Come on!
- I can't get it.
- Welded shut.
You just can't get good paranormal help these days.
Look.
Harris.
I'm sorry.
Man.
I didn't mean to say those things.
I'm sorry too.
- We didn't find anything.
- Does she have to be here?
- I can still help.
- Unless you have dynamite for the bars.
- Nobody wants your help.
- I know you're angry.
- But now it's not the time.
- When is the time?
'Cause the sun rises in less than an hour.
Then it's best not to waste it fighting with each other!
You'd better hope that little pyro gets me. 'cause I swear if I make it...
What?
The flashlights are in the hallway.
What what?
Wasn't Kira in this room?
I locked this door.
Oh my God!
What?
That's Emma's song.
I'm not going anywhere unless something's chasing me.
Stay here.
Oh.
God!
What am I looking at?
Uh.
I-I don't know.
Kira was dead.
She was dead.
Maybe she wasn't.
Maybe...
No no no.
She is.
She is dead.
Then how do you explain that?
Kira?
- Kira?
- Harris?
I don't know if that's a good idea.
Man.
Kira?
Kira?
Emma?
Help!
Bitch!
Help!
- What the hell happened to her?
- I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
You're the expert.
Wait wait wait...
do you guys smell smoke?
I think she's gone.
- Go!
Go!
- Wait.
Go!
Come on!
Come on!
- Vincent.
Move!
Let's go!
- Let's go!
Go.
Vincent!
Hey!
Hey!
Damn it!
Light.
Okay.
Fire extinguisher...
I gotta get a fire extinguisher...
Fire extinguisher.
Oh.
Man.
Help!
Help!
Let me out!
Help!
Let me out!
He's in here!
Let me out!
Get away!
Stay away!
Harris.
- Harris!
- Sid?
No!
No!
- Vincent?
- It's too late.
Go!
Allison.
The window!
- I don't wanna go.
- Great.
No bars!
- Come on!
- I don't wanna go...
No.
You have to do this!
Go!
- I don't wanna go without you.
- You can do this.
You'll be fine!
- I love you.
Harris!
- Go!
- I love you.
I love you.
- I love you too.
- No!
- Please.
I love you.
Harris.
Whoa!
Oh.
God!
Get in.
Get in!
Go!
Go... go!
Allison.
Go!
Go!
Harris!
Back to hell!
Harris!
Harris!
Harris!
Good Lord help me!
- Where the fuck is he?
- Harris!
Oh my God!
It's over.
Could anyone bring me to the hospital?
I need an ambulance.
What is it?
Nothing.
just the caretaker.
You can call me..
..the voice of a broken heart,
I am the instrument, which
.. contains all the melodies.
Who am I, what and am I..
..for whom am I alive..
...I myself don't understand..
...tell me that secret.
Tell me that secret.
Great!
Where did this deluge of poetry and ..
...melody come from, Bijjan Miyan.
From the neighborhood.
This voice belongs to the poet and courtesan, Umrao Jaan Ada, sir.
Look at this.
How beautifully has she sung the painful verse.
Who else can know better than you?
You yourself are a renowned writer and poet.
I have heard about her since long.
And today I wish to meet her.
Allow me to leave now, Bijjan Miya.
Maybe, she may shower on me also with some good memories.
Greetings.
I am Mirza Haji 'Roosva'.
I wish to meet Madam Umrao Jaan Ada.
You please wait, I will ask her.
- Yes, fine.
Thank you.
Ma'am, one Mirza Roosva wishes to meet you.
Send him in.
Yes, come in Sir.
- Thank you.
Greetings.
- Greetings.
Please sit, Roosva sir.
Thank you.
Thank you.
May God bless you.
Forgive me, I would not have disturbed your rest.
But your voice forced me.
It's your greatness.
Or who am I, and what about my voice.
Don't say that.
Because Ghazal, Poetry, and music.
All these are famous because of Umrao Jaan Ada..
..and they are attached to her.
And then, how did this happen today?
How did the pain get attached to the music of life?
You are well aware, Roosva sir.
It's the pain which gives birth to poetry.. to the music.
Great!
Then sing for me too!
What would you like to listen?
My 'self experience', or other tales?
I feel that you have seen life from near, and too minutely.
And apart from 'self experience'..
..there cannot be a better tale.
Now what can I say?
You stole my name from me.
What did you say?
I am the one who is notorious in the whole world..
..and you feel sorry?
Very nice!
And this thing, only Umrao Jaan Ada could say it!
Forget.
Who Umrao?
Whose Jaan (Love)?
And which Ada (Style)?
I was born in Faizabad and my name was Ameeran..
..and even today I am Ameeran.
Ameeran?
- Yes, Ameeran.
Come, I will tell you the tale of the same Ameeran.
Sister, what are you doing?
My ring is lost.
Mother will kill me.
Hey girl, what are you doing?
Nothing.
Just like that.
Whose daughter are you?
- My fathers, who else?
That's fine.
But who is your father?
My father is just coming.
Her father is coming.
- Her father is me.
Who are you?
Oh!
The enemy of my life!
Greetings, Dilawar Khan.
You have come?
You had sent me to prison for seven years by being a witness.
It was me who came a bit early.
Look, Dilawar.
I would have not spoken the truth..
..but when they asked to take the oath of Koran Sherif..
...I had to tell the truth.
Ok, you stick to your faith;
I will stick to my faith.
Come dear, let's go home.
Scoundrel!
He was greeting me as..
..if I had returned not from jail but from Haj.
I think his daughter is very dear to him.
- Yes.
Take this dear.
Your sugary sweets.
You are so nice father.
You get us sweets everyday.
Take this.
Look dear Jamaal, how much your sister loves you.
She feeds you first and then eats herself later.
Dear, may God always keep you happy?
Have you all come back?
Greetings!
- Greetings!
You have done me a great favour.
Don't you remember that we have..
..to go in Pande-ji's daughter's wedding.
You have come so late.
Look at your condition.
Come freshen up and get ready.
It is time to leave.
I do not know what magic has been cast upon..
..you by this tre_e that you keep play|ng..
...whole clay under that same tree.
Don't curse that tree, Ameeran's mother.
It is just like you.
You protect them from the..
...glare of the sun by your motherly care.
The tree also does the same.
Itself burns under the sun and gives shade to all of us.
Even my father the same thing.
He earns, and feeds us.
Great!
Look your dear daughter has matured.
Come, you yourself get ready and also take him with you.
Come dear.
- Wait, take this along also.
Come Ameeran, sit.
Give me your hand.
Come wash your hand.
Give me your other hand.
What!
Where is your ring?
Where is your ring Ameeran?
Where did your ring go!
It is lost.
- Lost!
Do you know what pains your father has taken to get it for you?
Lost it.
Now, why are you crying?
Have I hit you for the first time?
I am crying because father had worked hard to get me the ring.
Oh God!
Come, don't cry.
Come.
Come here.
Your father will get you another ring.
Don't cry.
Whatever you have done now, Oh God!
Don't do it again.
Whatever you have done now, Oh God!
Don't do it again.
Don't bring me back as a daughter in my next birth.
Whatever you have done now, Oh God!
Don't do it again.
Whatever you have done now, Oh God!
Don't do it again.
Don't bring me back as a daughter in my next birth.
Whatever you have done now, Oh God!
Don't do it again.
Father, wedding is a joyous occasion.
Yes, dear.
Very much.
Then why were Pande-ji's family members crying.
When you bid your daughter farewell, you are sure to cry.
When I will be bid farewell, will you also cry?
Surely dear.
Mother will go mad crying.
Then I will never marry.
Look dear, you will have to get married.
I have already said I will not marry.
I will remain with you..
will not go anywhere.
Today Mir sir had come from Mehmoodabad. - ls it?
He was asking to finalise the date of Ameeran's wedding.
ls Ameeran sleeping?
- Yes, she has slept.
We will get her married.
But the expenses are huge.
Where will we get from?
I do not know what those people are thinking.
Looking at our mansion anyone would be mistaken.
What do they know that I have inherited it?
Whatever, but we have to get her married.
Has anyone kept a daughter at home?
We have to get Ameeran married.
Raeesa!
Raeesa!
- Yes madam.
Look the flame of the lamp is flickering.
Pour some oil or do something.
- Yes madam.
But don't allow it to extinguish.
- Yes madam.
In the same way the lamp of my fate had extinguished.
The day I went to save that injured bird..
...along with Dilawar to his place.
The aunt in my house will blow on this bird and cure it. - ls it!
There wasn't any aunt there.
Aunty, where are you?
There was only Peerbaksh.
They shut my mouth and tied me with a rope..
..and stuffed me in a gunny sack and put me onto a bullock cart.
The cart kept going, on unknown roads.
Officer, keep your eyes on the road and walk.
If there would be an accident here.
Everyone would say that Dilawar has taken his revenge.
No, I do not have any enmity against you.
Only that these sugary sweets have fallen down.
What should I say to Ameeran?
Ameeran daughter?
Come on Peerbaksh.
And that was the last time I saw father.
Either he is innocent or very clever.
He says that he has no enmity.
He will understand it later.
What is your intention?
- I will cut her to pieces and throw away
No, no don't say like this.
There is bereavement beyond just simple death.
What it is?
- Let's take her to Lucknow.
Lets sell her to a brothel.
You will take your revenge.
And earn some money also.
Tell me how's the plan.
- You are very clever!
A golden cage for your parrot!
- Why not?
If you give me permission Khanum Sahib..
...I will ask for a handful of pearls.
Why is that?
- A golden cage to stay and pearls to eat.
Why are you jealous of my parrot?
I also feed you delicious food.
Indeed Khanum Sahib.
Indeed.
Take this.
Thank you.
Greetings.
- Greetings.
Khanum Sahib, one more small child..
..is waiting for her share of morsel.
Should I present her if you say so?
Call her.
- Peerbaksh, come in.
Greetings!
- Come here dear.
Don't fear.
Come and sit next to me.
- Come dear.
Don't fear.
Come.
Go.
- Very good.
- What is your name?
Ameeran.
- Ok.
Where do you stay?
- From Bangla.
Oh!
Where is this Bangla?
You simpleton!
Don't you even know that Faizabad is called Bangla?
So have you come from Faizabad?
No, I have not come on my own but have been brought forcibly.
Oh!
God only knows who's child she is.
God knows what her parents must be going through.
Don't know where these scoundrels pick them up from.
They are not a bit scared of God.
May God not make me speak a lie.
We are not to be blamed.
If she wouldn't be sold here..
..she would have been sold somewhere else.
Khanum Sahib, she will be safe here.
Haven't you heard how the girls are treated at other brothels.
God forbid!
Tell me.
- Give me 200 rupees.
Give 200 rupees!
If you want 200 rupees go to the police station.
I will give you 100.
- Don't treat me so badly, madam.
This girl has come to serve you.
In her youth she will also earn for you.
Madam, just look at her beauty also.
Your tongue is too sharp.
After all she is a human being.
You will get 120 rupees.
But..
- Hussaini.
Do you agree?
If not then take away the girl.
Take her.
No.
No.
I do accept.
Then go and wait outside.
I am sending the money.
Just get lost.
Do it quickly.
Now come on.
From today Ameeran is ours.
Khanum Sahib, hand over this girl to me.
I will bring her up.
The child is yours and the care is mine.
It's a good thing.
But I wont call her Ameeran..
...I will call her Umrao.
Wow!
What a beautiful name!
From today your name is Umrao.
Come, lets go.
- Umrao!
Yes?
Wow!
Come.
Come dear.
Ameeran daughter!
Dear, sugary sweets for you.
Ameeran?
Father.
Father.
Father.
What!
What!
What happened, dear?
Looks like you had a bad dream; that you got up.
But the dream was good.
Did you see your father in the dream?
- Yes.
Come.
Go to sleep now.
Go to sleep.
Umrao!
Where were you going?
- No, don't hit me!
Come dear.
Come, next to me.
I will not at all hit you.
I am like your mother.
Where were you trying to go?
Home.
- Your home is too far, dear.
And you don't even know the way.
Isn't it?
The world outside is very bad, dear.
So don't try to go anywhere.
Until I am here, I will not let you miss your mother, your father.
Wait here.
Your aunt is coming soon.
Look here, what has your aunt brought for you?
Look at these, these costumes.
Look..
Ornaments!
Aren't they nice?
Wear them.
Good!
This.
This.
And this.
Now you won't go anywhere?
- No.
Good!
And you.. got entangled in the colourful robes and silk threads.
Please accept!
- Yes, thank you.
And kept on entangling.
Just think.
A child, who had never heard of Atalla-ul-sur family.
She got to wear all this.
The one who always ate normal food..
..she got to eat exotic dishes.
Won't she go mad?
I also got companions and friends..
Bismillah, Khursheed Gauhar.
After meeting them, the desire to be like them also arose.
The priest and aunt Husseini didn't let me miss father and mother.
God forbid, what are you doing, dear?
A cot is never kept like that, it is a bad omen.
God forbid.
What happens, aunty?
- God forbid.
Dear, when a person dies, only then the cot is kept like this.
Head down and legs up.
Let's turn it straight.
Bravo!
- Come on, move.
Move.
Did you see?
- Yes.
Come, today we will teach you about our customs.
Go and freshen up.
My training started.
Along with education, I also learnt of manners and salutations.
And Husseini also taught to speak..
..and the Moulvi sir taught me poetry.
Khan sir introduced me to melody..
..and my teacher taught me to dance.
Anklets were tied on my legs.
And step by step my childhood was left behind.
And youth knocked on my door.
Gauhar Mirza, what sort of a joke is this?
Cannot see the face!
It's nice.
If you cannot see the face, then it's nice.
If the face is beautiful, then you yourself cast an evil eye.
Let it be!
I am not beautiful.
Beautiful is Bismillah, Khursheed, Aamir..
..their lovers always encourage them.
New gifts every day.. costumes..
ornaments..
Servants..
And if by chance I go there..
Umrao, good that you came, please fetch me the betel leaf spittoon.
They make me run away from there by some excuse!
Do you know, why?
They are scared of you, you may steal their lovers.
After looking at your face, they won't like another face!
It's your misconception.
Their lovers also comb their hair!
Look at me, I have to do everything myself!
If you allow, shall I myself attend to your hair?
What sort of mischief is this?
Why did you touch me like that?
So what?
ls it the first time lam touching you like this?
It was different in childhood!
And childhood is left far behind.
You scoundrel!
What is this foolishness?
Go, get out from here!
But aunty, on Umrao's saying I was combing her hair.
Don't talk rubbish.
I am aware of your behaviour.
You always run around chasing girls.
Even your father was the same.
He was a Nawab by name..
..but he never left any woman alone!
Look aunty, don't say anything about father.
Shut up, fool.
Leave quietly from here, or I will give you a..
.. beating you wont forget.
Get up from here and leave!
Tell whatever you wish, aunty.
I am here at your mercy
Shut up, you fool.
I also get angry at this guy, and also feel sorry for him.
Why did you agree to that scheming guy?
What can I do?
I was fed up of this unruly and dry hair.
Even you don't have time for me.
Actually, no one has time for me.
Not even Khan sir.
Don't feel dejected.
Times do change.
Even Umrao will have her lime light.
Leaving behind my parents abode.
And my mothers affection.
An innocent bird only gets a cage.
What is the matter dear?
Your eyes are wet.
It is not good, clear.
- No, it's nothing.
Just like that.
I remembered a song of my childhood.
Don't bring me back as a daughter in my next birth.
The childhood is left behind, and the language too.
Now you will speak in local dialect.
Dear, you must have learnt a new poem.
Recite that.
Come on, recite.
Please listen.
Recite.
'Let your eyes mesmerise any one you wish.'
'Let your eyes mesmerise any one you wish.'
'Even if your eyes fall on a stone, it turns into a goblet'
Great!
'your eyes fall on a stone, it turns into a goblet.'
Wow!
But clear, instead of 'eyes', make it 'gaze'.
Eyes don't fall, gaze falls.
Oh!
Only a genius could say that.
Thanks.
- You cannot escape easily by saying thanks.
I helped you, now you have to help me.
Are you asking help from me?
- Why not?
Give me the order.
- There is a phrase.
'I had forsaken the world, for the sake of my beloved.'
There are no other words to complete this phrase.
Now, you tell me.
'For the sake of my beloved'?
- Yes.
'For sake of beloved" the world..
'I had forsaken the world, for the sake of my beloved.'
'The same beloved left me, for the sake of the world.'
Wow!
Fantastic!
What a brain you have?
Today..
I really wish to bestow you with a gift.
Tell me, what do you want?
Shall I ask?
- Yes, ask.
Wm YOU give?
- Why not?
Then get me a bowl full of sugary sweets!
- Sugary sweets?
My father used to bring for me every day in the evening.
What are you thinking, Moulvi sir?
You have bound me for the rest of my life.
If my life remains faithful to me..
..my blessings will be always with you.
But you will not get me the sweets.
I will get, I will also get them.
Dear, keep this with you.
This ring will always protect you.
Greetings.
- Be seated.
Be seated.
Bismillah.
Let's see, what have you learned?
Come.
Marvellous!
Madam.
Now Umrao..
Khursheed!
Excellent!
Live long.
Live long.
You are the brilliance of my brothel.
Wow!
Greetings, Madam.
A lady has come with a message for you.
Let her come in.
Come.
Greetings.
- Yes, say.
Madam, I have brought a message and advance from..
..Nawab Shuja-at Ali Khan.
There is a wedding in Sir's family.
It is obvious that all the dignified members".
..of the city will be attending.
Sir wishes that the 'Mujra' (a dance form)..
...should be performed by your troupe ls it?
- Sir has also said that your most..
"Excellent dancer should perform.
You will get any fees you ask for.
Tell the Nawab Sir that I agree.
And we will surely be present.
Salutations.
It is obvious that the Nawab Sir..
..has left the arrangements for dance on me.
Madam, Bismillah and Khursheed, both are ready.
Whomever you select, she will stand up to your expectations.
I wish that this dance should be performed..
By Umrao.
What?
Me?
Live long.
This is the right time.
My first 'Mujra', for the first time, in such a big gathering.
The whole Lucknow would be there.
Isn't it nice?
In a single night, mesmerize..
..the whole of Lucknow's royalty, with your talent.
A diamond is not aware of its sparkle..
...only a jeweller can know it.
You are our invaluable pearl.
Now is the time.. for the pearl to come out of the shell.
Go, and get prepared.
Yes Khanum madam.
Congratulations dear.
Pardon my insolence.
But you did not do the right thing.
By selecting Umrao you have insulted all of us.
Whatever Madam does, is well thought of.
You could have also chosen me, lam your own child.
Remember one thing Bismillah.
There is no room for emotions or relations in this profession.
May God forbid me from speaking lies..
...I am not deprived you of motherly love.
But whatever I do, is only for you..
..so that you lead a comfortable life.
If Umrao is famous, this court will be renowned.
And only fame is the path to wealth.
When God kept a heart in the chest, he also gave love along with it.
Lots of love.
And that too, to shower all of it on a single person.
Wow!
God is great!
The night.. when my first 'Mujra' was at..
..one of Lucknow's royal court, I met that person.
What happened?
What happened?
No, I lost my ring somewhere.
- Where did it fall?
..
- It fell here."Don't know.
Look.
Here.
Here.
- It's not here.
Its not even here.
Are you looking for this?
Thanks.
I have advised my heart
.. a million times.
But still my heart has brought me here.
It has brought me here..
- Wow!
Greetings.
Greetings.
I have arrived in your celebrations.
I have arrived in your celebrations.
Why shouldn't I do this also?
I wish to greet you.
I wish to greet you.
Look at me so that I greet you.
Wow!
Umrao, wow!
I have arrived in your celebrations.
Why shouldn't I do this also?
I wish to greet you.
Look at me so that I greet you.
My heart has come upon you.
But this is not true my dear.
My heart has come upon you.
But this is not true my dear.
Whoever I turn and see.
Whoever I turn and see.
I will make him my slave.
Wow!
- You are amazing my dear.
- Wow!
I wish to greet you.
Look at me so that I greet you.
There are many things to tell you.
There are many things I need to tell you.
There are many things to tell you.
There are many things I need to tell you.
Whenever you meet me alone.
Whenever you meet me alone.
I will tell you everything I know.
Long live Umrao.
Long live.
I wish to greet you.
Look at me so that I greet you.
Wow!
Umrao, wow!
- Great!
- Wow!
Whether it is the love between Laila and Majnu.
Or the love between Shirin and Farhad.
Whether it is the love between Laila and Majnu.
Or the love between Shirin and Farhad.
If you show a little bit of bravery.
If you show a little bit of bravery.
Then even I will be famous like them.
Wow.
Great!
- Wow!
I have arrived in your celebrations.
Why shouldn't I do this also?
I wish to greet you.
Look at me so that I greet you.
Wow.
Great!
- Wow!
You have made us your slave.
Wow!
You were amazing, my love.
- Wow!
She is a part of you.
How grand was her salutation.
Dear, you have come back!
- I just arrived.
Your first 'Mujra', in such a big gathering.
How was it?
Yes.
It is all due to your training, blessings and Gods grace.
Well, it was fine.
Hey, stand up!
Let me clear the evil eye cast on her.
Great!
Today Umrao was amazing.
You won the hearts of entire Lucknow.
May God save you from evil eye.
You are doing right!
Our Umrao was already worthy of evil eye.
She must have become famous with this performance.
What sort of evil eyes must have been cast over her.
That's why the city's noble and rich are falling over each other.
To spend a night with our Umrao.
But only a lucky person can get the companionship of Umrao!
But I will allow only the one.. who will dish out the maximum amount.
Umrao's companionship is very expensive.
Today onwards you will be shifted to 'Sheesh Mahal'..
Where all the arrangements will be made for your luxuries.
Me.. will I be there alone?
- Indeed!
I wont go anywhere, I will remain here with you.
I have grown under your loving care here, since my childhood.
How can I go away from you?
It's not far.
We are around you.
And then dear, this home of ours, is lower than your esteem.
Don't speak in this manner.
I will always stay next to you.
Umrao.. childhood is left far behind.
Now learn to stay on your own.
Go dear, Sheesh Mahal is waiting for you.
A whole new world is waiting for you.
Wait..
Take this.
Take this mirror along with you.
Now you need not see the mirror secretly.
Aunty..
Be haPPV-
Yes.. how do I praise you, Umrao?
Last nights 'Mujra'..
..just think, as if we heard the Melody singing herself!
And we saw the lightening dance!
Don't praise me so much.
Or I will fall and turn into dust.
My God knows, you are more than just these praises.
To tell the truth, Umrao.
I have never been more happier in all these years.
This is true, I have always seen you sad.
The hurt of love, is always like this.
But..
love is always happiness!
Instead.
But, distance separation..
is always fatal.
God forbid, you never face this situation.
But when you fall in love, then you will know.
Umrao.
Khanum madam is arriving.
May you live long, Umrao?
Your salutations were so grand..
..that they touched Nawab Sultan deep in his soul.
He has agreed to pay as much you ask for.
He will arrive here tonight, and spend time with you in your bedroom.
You entertain him nicely and win his heart.
Come Umrao.
You also got your Nawab now.
But who is this Nawab?
He may be some old man, with his legs dangling in a grave..
..dreaming of Umrao's love, he will give his life away.
Maybe after going to heaven, he may find a fairy like Umrao or not?
Give your life away on the door of youth, why wait for death?
Umrao, Nawab Sultan is arriving.
How is he?
- He is like this.
Send him.
Come.
I wish to salute you, if you look at me.
lam saluting you.
You?
ls it You?
Yes.
Why, are you feeling surprised?
No, we all were expecting Nawab Sultan..
...would be an elderly person.
Have this beetle leaf.
- No, thank you.
Will you have wine?
- No.
Then what do you like?
lam in search of..
beauty and poise.
Which I found both of them, after seeing you.
Oh god!
You talk very sweetly.
Come.
Sit next to me.
What are you thinking?
In thousands of years..
I have seen the moon in the sky.
But I am the first person, who has the moon in his hand.
Oh God!
Forgive my insolence.
Nawab sir, come, your court is ready.
What is the need to hurry?
Be seated Nawab sir.
When you came near me..
I felt shy.
I knew the secrets of your heart.
It's the first time for you, and it's the first time for me too.
It's the first time for you, and it's the first time for me too.
When our eyes met, our hearts blossomed.
As if they were swaying.
It's the first time for you, and it's the first time for me too.
It's the first time for you, and it's the first time for me too.
In this romantic night, hand in hand.
During the talks, where did the matter reach?
In this romantic night, hand in hand.
During the talks, where did the matter reach?
In just one meeting, I dreamt about this.
My heart is pounding, and both of us were restless.
It's the first time for you, and it's the first time for me too.
It's the first time for you, and it's the first time for me too.
Love is binding, love is fate.
Love is an arrow, of the dream of love.
Love is binding, love is fate.
Love is an arrow, of the dream of love.
Love is devotion.
Love is like wine, which is its name.
And you spilt the wine on me.
It's the first time for you, and it's the first time for me too.
It's the first time for you, and it's the first time for me too.
It's the first time for you, and it's the first time for me too.
It's the first time for you, and it's the first time for me too.
Congratulations.
Congratulations Khanum Sahab.
Our Umrao is now Umrao Jaan. (Beloved)
Have theses sweets.
Take these.
This is good news that you brought.
But mind you, Nawab Sultan should fall in love with Umrao..
..in such a way, that she becomes his weakness.
He should not be able to go away from Umrao at all.
Rich folks like him cannot be trapped easily.
I will take care, Khanum ma'am.
Bye..
Khursheed, congratulations, take these sweets.
Congratulations Bismillah, take these sweets..
..our Umrao is now Umrao Jaan.
Congratulations aunty.
Many congratulations.
Hey, what is the matter, Gauhar Mirza..
..your royal blood is pumping through.
Leave this, and take the sweets..
.. our Umrao is now Umrao Jaan.
Eat.
- No, aunty, last night I swallowed a bitter pill.
Let me enjoy that bitterness.
Let it be, fool, let the bitterness be there.
I have heard that Nawab Sultan is coming again today evening.
You are right, that's why our Umrao Jaan..
..is confused about what to wear?
Oh, looks like Umrao Jaan has fallen in love with Nawab Sultan
Yes, even I feel something like this.
Fine.
But Khanum madam wishes..
..that your magic should work on him, not his
So that you turn into his weakness.
And if he becomes my weakness, then?
Then advise the cold heart..
..or you will commit the same mistake, that I committed.
If love is a mistake..
then let a mistake be.
Innocent heart, what has happened to you?
'
Innocent heart, what has happened to you?
'
What is the ultimate remedy for this pain?
Innocent heart, what has happened to you?
'
When did you arrive?
- When had I left?
ls it?
Let me see, come, lie in my lap.
What are you looking at?
My fate?
- Oh no, the ring.
I wanted to see if you are wearing it or not?
God forbid, keep it with care.
And if you lose it, then you will get a thrashing.
Who will thrash me?
- Me, who else?
ls it?
So things have progressed to this stage?
Beyond that.
When I was small, I had lost my ear rings..
..mother had slapped so hard, that my eyes were stinging.
It must have pained badly?
No, it was not the pain, but I cried too much.
Ok, tell me.
Did you sleep soundly last night?
- No.
Your thoughts kept me awake.
You?
I was thinking about my messiah the whole night.
Promise me, until I am alive..
..you will come every day to meet me.
I would promise, but keeping the promise will be difficult.
Why?
- Because my father has finalized my marriage to Sabaa.
Saba?
- Yes.
- Who is that Saba?
My aunt's daughter.
In spite of me, you think of some one else..
..this is bigger than the news of my death.
Go away from here.
For Gods sake, leave me alone.
The unlucky symbol of love, return me that ring.
First you return my ring.
- Never!
Why?
Because I have loved".
I will keep this ring with me for the rest of my life.
Return me the ring, and leave from here.
Enough, Umrao.
Enough.
I am not going to marry some one else.
I just wanted to know..
..how much love you have for me in your heart.
This means you had a doubt on my loyalty.
No, ma'am, no.
And if I had.. then now it is not there at all.
I promise I will stay with you, forever!
And you will come every day to meet Umrao.
Daily.
Ok, now you got a promise out of me..
Shall we talk about you now?
Where you are..
love is traded day and night here.
Flesh is sold.
How confidently can you assure me..
..that you are mine.. and only mine!
This means.. you think of me as other courtesans.
Nor was I born in a brothel..
And nor I am like other..
courtesans.
I was Ameeran, and now lam Umrao Jaan.
And I am mad for that same Ameeran.
Who was born in the unlucky home in Faizabad..
..and was brought here because of her helplessness.
You are surprised?
I have known everything about my beloved.
Come. ls it solved now?
No. first tell me how is your Saba?
ls she beautiful?
More than me?
- Much more.
So much that..
I feel I am not worthy of her.
Amazing.
You are not worthy of her..
..and I am not worthy of you.
What will happen then?
When did I tell you that you are not worthy of me?
Just now, some time back, you called me a deceiver.
Before that, even you called me a deceiver.
The difference is, even after your deceit..
..you will remain an Nawab.
And me, even after being faithful..
...will always remain an courtesan.
Who has understood whom here?
What did I understand?
What did you understand?
I thought of you as unfaithful, beloved.
And you thought of me as unfaithful.
Don't accuse me falsely, my love.
Don't accuse me falsely, my love.
The heart is delicate; don't hurt it in this way.
False accusations..
If you don't like the tears in my eyes.
If you don't like the tears in my eyes.
Then don't hurt me, and don't tease me.
Then don't hurt me, and don't tease me.
The heart is delicate; don't hurt it in this way.
False accusations..
You belong to some one e|se's fate, you are not mine
You belong to some one e|se's fate, you are not mine
If this is the truth, then don't reveal it to me.
If this is the truth, then don't reveal it to me.
The heart is delicate; don't hurt it in this way.
False accusations..
You just came now, you sat now, and you are leaving now.
You just came now, you sat now, and you are leaving now.
Don't just come to keep your promise.
Don't just come to keep your promise.
The heart is delicate; don't hurt it in this way.
Don't accuse me falsely, my love.
The heart is delicate; don't hurt it in this way.
False accusations..
Since when I have met you..
Where are you rushing inside?
This is Umrao Jaan's bedroom.
Where are going?
.
I know, that's why I am going inside.
- Stop!
Stop!
.
Who are you?
And what is this insolence?
Can't you see, I have a guest sitting here?
If he is sitting, then he can also be evicted.
What he has given I can pay double the amount.
You are a too indecent person.
Looks like you are not accustomed to sit among decent people.
Too good!
You are sitting at a courtesans place".
..and preaching about decency?
You are crossing your limits.
God forbid, if my Pathani blood boils over..
..and you loose your life.
I have seen many Pathans in my life.
Come here.
Come here, Umrao Jaan!
Oh!
Oh!
Blood!
Blood, Allah, blood!
This!
What did you do?
Mohammed Afzal!
Take him to a doctor, fast!
Oh God!
What will happen now?
Nawab sir.
You go away from here.
We will take care here.
I will not go from here.
I will remain here and face everything.
For Gods sake, go.
I put you under my oath, go away from here now.
Why?
You got scared?
You have come in contact with a youth of the Pathan clan.
Nothing is dearer than your life.
I am leaving if you are saying.
He went away on my saying.
But did not return for a long time.
I got scared.
And then I pleaded with Allah.
God promise.
This sadness on you face doesn't suit you at all.
If there is sadness in fate, what can a person do?
And if I convert this sadness into joy, will I get a present?
You know the name of my joy.
- Yes, I know.
That scoundrel Sultan.
I have brought you news of him.
Then tell me the news.
- First give me my present.
He says:
I cannot come, but you can surely come.
Where?
- To his friends place.
I know where it is.
Then take me there!
But, Khanum sahab.
- I will handle her.
May God bless you.
Dear.
Greetings.
But take your sweets along with you.
You remembered my sweets?
But where are you going out from the brothel, in a hurry?
Even if I wish, I cannot speak lies to you.
I am going to meet Nawab Sultan.
- That, Pathan?
He looks like a nice guy.
Do you like him?
May God help you.
Go.
Go, leave.
Be fast..
My eyes were longing to see you.
Greetings.
He is my friend Ashraf, and she is..
- Umrao.
Nowadays my friend has only one name on his lips, Umrao.
Madam, this my humble abode.
And I am not used to interfere.
And so, I ask for leave.
Goodbye.
Your friend is very interesting.
I know the tale of love is long, and time is less.
By the way, two moments of love, are equal to a life time.
Your talks are also magical, like your eyes.
The way you glanced at me, as if you swayed me.
You have taught me to watch dreams.
How can I complain with that life about oppression?
The life that brought us closer to each other.
The way you glanced at me, as if you swayed me.
There is intoxication in your eyes, and waves in your hair.
There is intoxication in your eyes, and waves in your hair.
The ocean of youth, you made me aware of it.
The world of desire, the tales of love.
The world of desire, the tales of love.
What shall I say, you gave me everything.
The way you glanced at me, as if you swayed me.
The scenes are dipped in lots of colours.
The scenes are dipped in lots of colours.
What destination have you brought me to.
The weather of spring has arrived because of you.
The weather of spring has arrived because of you.
You have fulfilled me, you have blossomed me.
The way you glanced at me, as if you swayed me.
You have taught me to watch dreams.
How can I complain with that life about oppression?
The life that brought us closer to each other.
Where is Umrao?
Also call her.
But she has gone?
- Gone?
Where?
To meet Nawab Sultan, at his friends house.
How dare she?
Didn't you stop her.
I tried very much, but love is beyond control.
Bismillah!
For gods sake, learn to behave properly from Khursheed.
Who was she?
- Umrao Jaan, Lucknow's famous courtesan.
Raisa.
You have come back, Banno.
Where had you gone?
I had gone to..
Nawab Sultan had invited to his friends home.
I had gone there.
Without my permission?
You very well know, that without my permission..
..no one come in, or go out.
This brothel belongs to Khanum sahib.
Nawab Sultan is self reliant, and also sensible.
I know that I have to pay for my time to Khanum sahib..
..take this.
This is the price.
The way you are speaking, as if there is tyranny.
Oh no, it is raining deeds.
But don't forget my deeds Umrao Jaan.
Yes, Khanum sahib.
What is the matter, Umrao?
Why is Khanum angry with you?
What can I say?
I had gone to meet Nawab Sultan..
..and committed a crime.
Yes.
Finally you fell in love.
You can think like that.
May God bless, we are traders of love.
But we don't have the right to fall in love.
But I am helpless.
That's why I have composed this poem.
What have you written?
Tell me.
'It was necessary to fall in love;
life cannot be lived like this.'
'Fantastic!
Our loves flight was touching the sky.'
'The desires were getting fulfilled.'
'And the love was so deep, that we could not see beyond each other.'
I was about to watch a dream, then..
I have composed a poem.
Recite.
An accomplished thief, stole my heart.
And near ones, they went on sleeping.
Now shall I recite.
An accomplished female thief, stole my heart.
I knew that.
You will surely bring together the thief and the female thief.
Sir, Nawab Shujat Ali Khan has arrived to meet you.
Call him in.
- Thank you.
What will happen now?
Salutations.
Maybe you are the courtesan, named Umrao.
Yes.
- It would be better if you leave.
Now.
At this moment!
I wish to talk to my son in private.
Greetings.
Father, you dishonored Umrao and told her to leave.
This is not only her insult, but also my insult.
And I did not like this.
ls it?
You found Umrao's insult, insulting?
And you are going against my orders, what about them?
I had told you, not to meet Umrao.
I love Umrao.
Love.
Son, love is that feeling, that comes out as blessings..
..from a fathers mouth, and as milk from a mothers breast.
A love bought with wealth, it's not love, but lust.
Then father..
Now you are pointing a finger at the purity of my love.
How pure is our love, only God knows that.
And you are not God!
Now you have stooped down to Insolence!
You are talking rubbish.
Don't forget, the wealth that you are spending on that courtesan..
..that is not your own, but mine!
I can Dis-inherit you.
Then Dis-inherit me.
Because Umrao will not go out of my life.
Fine!
Then I Dis-inherit you from right this moment!
From my life, wealth, from home, and property.
You are back.
Hope things are fine.
Things are not fine.
His father reached there.
He was very angry.
He wanted to talk to Sultan in private.
Then?
- Then what?
My heart is beating faster since then.
You go and find out, what happened and what not?
Me?
- For Gods sake, bring the news soon.
I will wait here.
Wow Gauhar Mirza.
She also wished..
..but for the news of her lover.
Umrao.
Umrao.
What's the news?
Why don't you speak?
ls the news bad?
Not that bad, and not even good.
But then speak up!
There was an altercation between the father and son.
Matters came to such a level, that Nawab sir Dis-inherited his son..
..from his wealth, property..
..and maybe, maybe even from the home.
But why?
Nawab Sultan was adamant of your love..
..and his father does not like this, even a bit!
Leave me alone.
Welcome.
Are you sure that Nawab Sultan will come?
Khanum sahib, he is Nawab Faiz Ali.
Greetings.
Please have a seat.
First you sit.
God bless, why this gun?
Yes?
Oh!
I understood.
But I have heard, that when a gun is fired in a brothel..
..that brothel becomes more popular.
But you rest assured, no bullet will be fired from my gun.
Ok, forget this gun.
Bring forth your wrist.
Order, which beauty would you prefer from our brothel?
Umrao Jaan.
Umrao Jaan, won't you offer me beetle leaf?
The praises of Umrao Jaan's youth, brought me here.
Khanum sahib.
Tell him, that I will not be able to give her company.
I belong to Nawab Sultan.
And I remain loyal to him.
Did you listen?
May God stop me from speaking lies..
..even we are helpless in front of her loyalties.
And for the time being, I am happy to see Umrao Jaan.
Greetings.
Faiz Ali sir.
We also have other beauties here,
Khursheed, Bismillah, Husna, Zeenat,
You can select any one.
But no. my ill fate is, that I love Umrao Jaan.
And Umrao loves some one else.
But I am not sad.
If life remains loyal, then we will meet.
A glimpse of Umrao Jaan, and the value of your time.
Thank you.
You allowed Faiz Ali a moment at your feet.
Many, many thanks for that.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
He is crooked, but the guy is wealthy.
Toast to Nawab Sujjat Ali.
Listen.
Go on.
lam coming soon.
I am asking, this Vagabond lover..
..till when will he sit here and drink liquor?
Talk slowly, he will listen.
Let him listen, do we care about him?
lam telling you, I will not bear more.
Begum, he is my friend, try to understand.
Then maintain friendship!
Permit me.
I will leave this home and go.
There is no need for you to go.
Give me some time.
Ashraf Miyan.
Take me to Umrao.
You.
And at this time?
Hope everything is fine?
I drank liquor.
I drank too much.
Won't you hit me?
- why are you saying so?
He was insisting, take me to Umrao Jaan, so I brought him here.
You did a good deed.
Thanks.
Nawab sir will stay with me.
Look.
Come.
I am homeless, but lam not disabled.
Come..
Come.
Are you trying to advise me?
Do you think this is the first time that I am intoxicated?
I am not intoxicated since today.
Which was the ghazal?
Look at me, so that I greet you.
Greet me..
What are you saying?
But you are my crown.
- Crown!
Homeless.
Jobless.
Poor.
Crown.
Did you didn't find any one else to joke with?
For Gods sake, don't talk like this.
- Why?
You don't believe that I am homeless.
Go, and ask my father.
Nawab Sultan Ali Khan.
I was 4 months old.
I pissed on his lap..
..then he picked me up and threw me on the floor.
So what if he threw me away from his life, nothing great.
Yes, there is one thing.
Will you throw me away out of your life?
What are you saying?
You are my life itself.
Even I love you more than my life.
But if you be unfaithful.
Then remember one thing..
This Pathan will cut you and throw away from his life.
Fine, cut me and throw away.
But why are you talking this way?
Things will be fine.
Your father will hug you.
Amazing.
Here I am, talking about our love..
..and you are talking of my father.
ls it that you feel pity for me?
I myself am worth pitying.
How can I feel pity for others?
Turn here.
Let me see in your eyes.
I can clearly see..
Pity.
Pity.
And that too for your slave.
Slave.
The slaves place is not here.. it's here.
What are you doing?
You be here, next to me.
No.
I am your slave.
- Listen.
What childishness is this?
Come here.
Come on the bed.
Come.. come up.
But I.. am the slave of Umrao Jaan.
Slave.
So then even I am your slave.
Even I will sit here.
It's okay.
We will sleep here itself.
Okay, sleep here itself.
Here Khanum.
Will it look good?
Khursheed, look at this.
How fine is the embroidery?
Its too fine, and very nice.
It will suit you well.
Ma'am look at this.
- No. its not nice.
Show me the other one.
- Take this.
Show me the one below.
That purple one.
Look at its embroidery.
Show me the most expensive one.
Call the Nawab Sultan here.
Take this.
I don't want this.
Greetings, Nawab Sultan sir.
Come.
You sit next to me.
I came to know that you had come last night itself?
God forbid, your health was not well.
How are you now?
I am fine.
- May Allah keep you fine always.
But what had happened?
- No, nothing much.
There is news in the air..
..that you had an altercation with the senior Nawab Sir
Nawab sir, these things keep happening at homes.
Don't take umbrage to my talks.
And as far as I know him..
...all the wealth is in the hands of senior Nawab sir.
Whenever he wishes he can be generous..
..and when he wishes, he will close his palms.
But, Khanum sahab..
- You don't interfere.
I was explaining the worldly matters to him.
May God forbid me from speaking lies, Nawab sir.
Rich people like you give the status to a courtesan.
Or then, what is the value of an poor courtesan?
If she falls in love, what will she eat then?
A courtesan has only one relative, and that is wealth.
You said the right thing.
Khanum sahib, Nawab Sultan has..
- You interfered again?
Okay forget these talks.
Look, these are the shawls.
If you be generous, because of you..
..at this old age, I may purchase a shawl.
The fool is quoting a price of 5000..
Now you say, where do I get such a big amount from?
Greetings.
Faiz Ali sir!
Greetings.
Come, be seated.
Khanum sahib, if you are looking at me for the shawl..
..then I am not ashamed to say..
..that I don't have money with me.
The matter of shame is for most of the Nawab's from Awadh.
My luck!
Now I am reduced to this state!
That for a rag like this, I have to plead to such rich folks!
Take this necklace.
It was gifted by the Nawab Sultan himself!
Take this, and purchase the shawl.
She is speaking lies.
I did not give this necklace.
Nawab Sultan, you are our dearest guest.
You can stay here as long as you wish..
..but if someone says that, such a rich Nawab..
..is surviving on a courtesans generosity..
..then won't I drag my claws at his face?
I beg your pardon, but the matter is dragging too long.
Take this.
And hand over the shawl to Khanum sahib.
And yes, I will buy one more..
for Umrao Jaan.
And if you both wish, I will buy for both of you too.
Now I wish to leave.
But before I leave I wish to say..
...that by weighing love on the scales of wealth..
..you have not only insulted me, but the whole humanity.
Looks like you are not accustomed to reality, Nawab sir.
Actually the truth is this, Khanum sahib..
..that I am the Nawab, and you a brothel keeper.
Where are you going?
Stop.
Even I will come along with you.
No, Umrao.
You cannot come with me.
You will stay here and wait for me.
The people who have abused you..
...I cannot stay with them for a moment.
So will you increase my difficulties?
As it is I am wandering in the wilderness.
Try to understand, Umrao.
I can fight the whole world..
..but cannot wipe what is written in fate.
And struggling is my destiny now.
And waiting is in your destiny now.
This wait is going to take my life.
Goodbye.
What is this condition?
Come on, get up and get ready.
Faiz Ali khan is waiting downstairs.
But Khanum sahib, I love Nawab Sultan..
- Forget him.
Nawab Sultan is a dream.
And a courtesans eyes are not for watching dreams..
..they are there for showing dreams.
To entice people.
But Nawab Sultan is not a dream, he is a reality.
And I love him.
Love!
Umrao Jaan, this lavish life does not run on love..
..it runs with the support of wealth.
It's fine.
Nawab Sultan will return..
.. and will bring wealth with him.
What happens tomorrow I don't know.
Speak of today.
Today Nawab Sultan is penniless, and Faiz Ali wealthy
Shake away that penniless persons hand..
..and grab Faiz Ali's robes.
There is benefit in this..
ours.. and also yours!
There is nothing to gain by crying.
Dear, we all are trapped in this situation.
Even you.. and even me.
Even you!
Quoting a verse by Ghalib..
'It takes a life time for to get my wishes come through..
...I may not live to see the clay, when your tresses oblige me'
Sir, your slave is ready.
Slave?
You are the queen of my heart.
The one who is sold, how can she be a queen?
Only my heart can decide of this.
No one else!
But no one will listen to the decision of my heart.
Why wont listen?
I will listen, and keep listening for ever.
But will not abandon the search for happiness.
The happiness that you search..
she is no more than a living corpse, nothing else!
And a corpse is meant for a grave.
Not worthy of love.
For Gods sake don't talk this way.
You better kill me, but don't kill my desire.
I will surely achieve my happiness.
Very few people keep..
..the promises they make.
Don't fall in love, because there is only sadness in love.
If I am not able to meet you, don't have desire for me.
If I am not able to meet you, don't have desire for me.
You are under my oath.
You are under my oath, don't have craving for me.
If I am not able to meet you, don't have desire for me.
You are under my oath.
You are under my oath, don't have desire for me.
If I am not able to meet you, don't have desire for me.
The one whom I love, he has a strange habit.
The one whom I love, he has a strange habit.
Sometimes turn your head away, sometimes stop talking.
You are under my oath, don't have craving for me.
If I am not able to meet you, don't have desire for me.
I wish to see only you.. only you.
I had loved some one, look at my condition now.
I had loved some one, look at my condition now.
The mistake that I committed, you don't ever commit it.
You are under my oath, don't have craving for me.
If I am not able to meet you, don't have desire for me.
Faiz Ali!
You had told the truth.
Without a heart you are a living corpse.
But Faiz Ali will surely bring this corpse to life..
..or, will convert into a dead body!
Ashraf sir.
- Hold it for a moment!
Greetings.
- Greetings.
How are you?
- I am alive.
Do me a favour.
If you know whereabouts of Sultan sir, then tell me.
The news is that, his uncle..
..Nazimuddin has taken him along to Garhi.
Garhi!
Yes, he is the senior officer there.
ls this uncle the same whose daughters name is Saba?
The one with whom his father wished to get him married?
Yes.
He is the same.
Your guess is right.
Okay, I am leaving.
Take care of yourself.
Greetings.
- Greetings.
Come on Zafar.
Greetings.
What are you doing?
Come.
Have a seat.
Even you sit, next to me.
Look, on your saying, I have left my desire too.
And I have also left my craving.
At allow me to serve you.
What did you say?
To serve is our duty.
You don't even like my company.
Where did I say that?
Then come with me, in the open air.
You must be feeling stifled her.
Not for ever, just for a month.
Where?
- To my place, at Daulatabad.
But where is Daulatabad?
Too far from here, even away from Kanpur.
We will go via Garhi
Via Garhi?
- Yes.
The nature is generous on me.
Even your heart will blossom.
You said it right.
I feel stifled here.
I will come with you.
But..
Khanum sahib?
When you are ready to accompany me..
..you should not have fear of Khanum sahib, not any one.
May I leave?
Umrao, you have insisted to go along with Faiz Ali..
..and I have received my desired remuneration.
My blessings are with you.
But my heart is troubled very much.
Look dear, however our world is, it is our own.
The world outside is very ugly.
We may not have fame, but whatever we do, we do it truthfully.
We do it honestly, not with deceit, or cheating.
What sort of world will you find after going out?
My heart shudders thinking of this.
God is great.
I was coming to meet you, Moulvi sir.
I am going.
- Where?
Along with Faiz Ali.
For one month.
With Faiz Ali?
I will reach Garhi with Faiz Ali.
Nawab Sultan is there itself.
I wish to spend my life at his feet.
Bless me, that my wish comes true.
- Amen.
May God keep you happy.
But dear, don't turn around and return here.
But you don't tell the matter of Garhi to anyone.
You go carefree.
My every breath blesses you.
When you had arrived here, no one was my own.
No one!
You came and I found a daughter.
Today I am bidding farewell to that daughter with joy.
If your father would be here..
..he would have given many things on your farewell
But I do not have anything apart from blessings.
For Gods sake don't talk like this.
You are the richest father in the world.
What not did you give?
Love, affection, knowledge..
..because of these, I can face this selfish world.
Wherever I will be, I will remember you always.
Take care of your self.
Now please leave..
or else I will cry.
You don't bid farewell to anyone crying.
Please leave.
What have you have done, God, don't do this again.
In my next birth, don't bring me back as a daughter.
In my next birth, don't bring me back as a daughter.
May God be with you.
In my next birth, don't bring me back as a daughter.
I'll be going for a while, you will have to wait for some time here.
Yes.
Who are these horsemen?
Are they with you?
Yes, they are my soldier's of my kingdom.
Come.
Greetings.
- Greetings.
The ma'am will stay here for a while.
Of course.
- Thank you.
You are leaving me alone here?
This is Gods abode.
There is no safer place than this.
I will just come back in a jiffy.
You relax here.
There is loneliness, there is sadness, there is destruction.
When you are not with me?
The court is deserted, my heart is also deserted, there is wilderness.
When you are not with me.
Its Gods grace you came back.
Rest here for some time.
Oh God, what happened to his hand?
Nothing much.
It was a small incident, he must have got injured.
Come, collect your things, we will have to leave.
Be quick!
And where is your gun?
Maybe it must have fallen down in that incident.
Come.
Greetings.
Come.
You move back.
Dacoit Faiz Ali, since many years I wanted to catch you.
Finally today you are in my grasp.
We have been following you since last night.
All your comrades have been caught.
And now it's your turn.
Take them all to Garhi, and also these women.
Mr. Sultan, all your troubles were in Lucknow..
..so I brought you here.
But it looks like Lucknow has followed you here too.
Has Father come?
- No, dear.
Umrao has reached here.
Umrao?
But she is not alone.
She has been arrested along with Faiz Ali..
..the dacoit, and his gang.
And she is our custody.
Faiz Ali dacoit.. but he is a Nawab.
No Mister, he is the dacoit..
..whom we have been searching since many years.
No.
This thing cannot be believed.
Dear Sultan, just go by the looks.
Looks can be deceptive.
Can I meet him?
- Why not?
Anytime.
And he came to meet me.
I felt that my destination is itself coming to embrace me.
And once again my troubled life played a joke on me.
And before reaching me, that scoundrel Faiz Ali met him.
Sultan Khan.
Garhi.
Now I understood.
Thanks for your favour.
Thanks for what?
You buy shawls to cover others bodies..
..when I saw your naked body, then..
I felt pity on you.
Finally the truth is out in the open.
Nawab Faiz Ali!
He is proved as dacoit Faiz Ali.
Sultan khan.
Where are you going?
- What is it to you?
It means that if you are going to meet Jaan..
...I mean Umrao Jaan, then you will have to take my permission..
..because she is now my keep.
What rubbish are you talking?
Because the moment you left her, she melted like wax, in my arms.
I am not interested in listening to any words against her.
You will be happy to know, that innocent girl..
..has come with me willingly.
The one you are calling innocent..
she is a courtesan.
And the courtesans humbleness and |oya|ty..
..both are her wealth.
Only wealth.
And it is obvious, that a dacoit has no dearth of wealth.
False!
The decision between true and false..
..you can sit with Umrao and discuss.
God promise.
You will sense my fragrance in her breath.
Faiz Ali!
- Yes.
You don't believe?
Come here.
If you don't believe".
..just have a look at her right thigh, you will find a big mole.
Looks like you have already seen it.
Why?
Umrao you will live.
But like a dead body.
Madam.
Sultan sir has called you.
Greetings, sir.
Umrao Jaan.
You all leave.
Now she is under my custody.
- Yes, sir.
You.. why did you drink liquor?
Now that I have come.
I had drunk liquor for the fist time..
..because I had left the world and come to you.
And now I am drinking liquor because I am leaving you.
Are you leaving me?
Surely you must be joking.
You joke with your own, not with strangers.
So now I am a stranger.
Now you will marry somebody else.
Now I am going to marry Saba.
Saba.. when I came to know that you are in Garhi.
I was scared that something like this will surely happen.
I am asking you what happened to those promises.
Those promises of living and dying together.
That ring, and those symbols of love.
Why?
Why are you pushing me out of your life?
What is my mistake?
What crime have I committed?
I have the right to ask.
You had the right.
The Umrao, the one who was loyal..
..but I am sorry to say that she is dead.
The moment..
The moment when she handed herself..
..over to someone else in her greed for wealth.
What..
What are you saying?
Remember what I had told you.
The day you become disloyal.
This son of Pathan will cut you and throw you away from his life.
I have met your buyer, Faiz Ali, the dacoit.
God is my witness.
I had used him as a medium to reach you.
By selling your soul.
And by making a deal with your body.
This is a lie.
He is misleading you.
And I am getting misled.
Faiz Ali can count the lines and curves on your body.
And he also recognises the mole on your body.
You very well know which mole I am talking about.
Would you like to listen to more?
Tell me.
Now give me an answer.
What luck?
This is a lie.
All these are lies.
All these are lies.
For God's sake believe me.
This is a lie.
The judge has given the order that..
..she be sent to Lucknow with due respect.
Don't show any dreams to these eyes..
The heart is delicate.
Don't hurt it like this"
False accusations..
I will never forget your favour till the end of my life.
You had shown me the dream of freedom from the cage..
.. and today you are sending me back to the same golden cage.
lam going away from your life..
do one more favour.
The way you dropped me, remembering those..
..moments of love, the same way you shed a tear also.
Oh god!
Coachman, what fire is this?
The crop has been cut, madam.
The barren land remains, it is being burned.
The old will be burnt to ashes so that the new will grow.
Look at my lover he has broken my heart.
After abandoning me midway he is settling a new life.
As like a child gets a new toy.
Plays with it for some days and then forgets.
Don't make me a doll like this who cannot even cry.
Don't bring me back as a daughter in my next birth.
Don't bring me back as a daughter in my next birth.
Whatever you have done now, Oh God!
Don't do it again.
Don't bring me back as a daughter in my next birth.
Umrao.
- Bismillah.
Umrao.
How are you Guhar?
Now I am fine.
That you are back.
How are you?
It's Gods grace.
We have all come to know Faiz Ali's reality.
And the tales of Sultans disloyalty.
I wish, you had learnt a lesson looking at my condition.
Life teaches many things.
Khursheed.
If pain is there, let it be.
Shall I ask you a question, Umrao.
Did you ever remember us?
Where had I forgotten?
God promise, we remembered you too much.
The way there are two sisters, they always keep fighting..
...In mother's home, but when one is bid farewell..
..then the other cries and feels sad.
Where is Khanum Sahib?
- She is inside.
She is not feeling well.
Umrao.
- Khanum sahib.
You have returned, dear.
Look at your condition.
May God forbid me from speaking a lie..
...I knew from clay one, that you will surely return..
..after experiencing life's difficulties.
Did you see?
The ugly face of the world outside.
Khanum sahib.
I wont ask you and you don't need to say anything, dear.
This is your own home.
There is always room for you here.
Now, how is your health?
When the daughter has returned..
..the mother will surely be fine.
Aunty.
Aunty.
Maulvi sir.
Aunty.
Who has kept this cot upside down?
When you already know that it is a bad omen.
No dear.
Why?
- Because your Moulvi sir, ..
..now will never bring sweets for you.
Father!
Father!
Father!
So you have returned finally.
You travelled to Garhi in search of that scoundrel.
Now he belongs to someone else.
It is fine.
Maybe God wanted this.
We stay together.
What rubbish are you talking?
Are you drunk?
God knows, that I have never seen you in that way.
So look at me now.
I am not that bad.
What is this Guhar?
Come to your senses.
Umrao Jaan, what not did I do for your love.
I have become a pimp from a Nawab.
I kept bringing and sending your messages from your lover.
I was waiting for just this moment.
Gauhar!
Gauhar!
I was coming to terms with my shattered life.
That one more storm came upon me.
A very big storm, which engulfed whole of the nation
To control the freedom fighters..
..the British also attacked Lucknow.
The lanes of Lucknow, reminded me of Karbala.
Then the British declared that..
The spark of revolt that started from Meerut..
..spread like wild fire throughout the country.
Crushing the heads of freedom fighters..
..the British got control of Delhi..
..now they are heading towards Awadh.
They have now reached the lanes of Lucknow!
Oh God!
Some one has cast an evil eye on Lucknow.
May god bless us, Khanum sahib, the times are bad.
May God bless!
This, Gauhar Mirza cannot be seen since few days.
Does any one know where has he gone?
Forget him, he must be lying somewhere with some girl.
Oh God!
Gauhar Mirza!
What happened?
Gauhar Mirza, blood!
What happened?
Not only me, Khanum sahib.
The whole of Awadh is awash in blood.
To tackle the revolt, the British have started bombarding.
People are being hanged at the gallows.
And the children".
"Children are being hanged up side down on the trees!
By God!
These are the days of calamity!
Some body get the ointment and apply to him.
Don't worry about me, Khanum sahib..
..don't be anxious about me, you take every one with you..
..and leave from here.
Now, no one is safe in Lucknow..
Nothing is safe in Lucknow.
ls the operation of the British only against the revo|ters..
..or against common citizens?
In their eyes, the whole of Awadh is revolting.
I have picked up this sword, only because of Awadh.
Finally the royal blood is coming through.
The Nawabi blood has finally handed a sword in your hand.
lam proud of you.
May God be always with you.
Now don't waste time, Khanum sahib.
You take all of them and leave from the back door.
I am going along with my comrades to confront the cruel.
Come on.. pack your belongings..
be fast.
Khanum sahib, where will we go?
- Anywhere.
We will move towards Nepal.
Come!
Come!
Come!
Gauhar..
I have forgiven you.
Goodbye!
- Goodbye.
Take care of your selves.
May God aid you in reaching safely.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
But you will also come with us, isn't it, mother?
No.
I will not leave!
- But why?
Where there is Khanum's brothel..
..even Khanum will remain there.
If the brothel turns into ashes, even Khanum will go down with it.
What are you saying, mother?
Come along with us.
Bismillah, I have always been strict with you..
..see to it, that in this fear, I am not accused of being unfair.
Because I am not only your mother..
..but mother to every girl of this brothel.
Please forgive me.
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Go.
Go now.
Hussaini, now I am handing over all of them to you.
Protect them!
- Mother.
Mother.
Go..
Go!
And our caravan reached Faizabad..
Bismillah and Khursheed said, Faizabad is your own town.
Why don't you take shelter here itself.
We may or may not reach Nepal.
And so I thought..
..why not meet Ameeran for the last time.
Raeesa was there along with us.
And the musicians also came along.
We rented a house and were ready for earning our living.
Ameeran wanted to meet her own folks.
But Umrao Jaan, she was a courtesan.. how could she go?
I was in a dilemma, and then a Nawab Sir came to me..
Greetings.
- Greetings.
Please have a seat.
Thanks.
Please say.
lam happy that a artiste like you, has arrived in Faizabad.
There is a wedding at our place".
..and it is my desire that you come and perform a Mujra.
Yes, I agree.
Thank God.
Faizabad has changed considerably.
Have you come to Faizabad before?
Yes, before the mutiny.
There used to be an officer at the..
..Bahu-Begum mausoleum.
He used to have a white house.
Yes, he was there.
But how do you know him?
It was a time before the mutiny, I had come during Muharram.
I had gone to the mausoleum to see the decoration..
..he took me to his house and tended to me.
Are you talking of the same officer..
..who's daughter had gone away?
What do I know?
There were many officers.
And even now they are.
But he was the only one to make..
..arrangements for the decorations before the mutiny.
He also had a son.
Where did you see his son?
I had told you that I had gone along with him to his house.
I had met him there.
The officer had expired before the mutiny.
His son is still working even today on his post.
Can I take your leave?
- Yes, you can leave?
Raeesa, prepare my palanquin.
Who?
lam the same child whom you had slapped.
Here, at this same place.
Oh God!
Are you Ameeran?
My..
My daughter!
Mother!
Mother!
- Ameeran!
Mother!
Father has left us and gone.
How should I share your grief?
You surely would have shared our grief if you were Ameeran.
But you are a courtesan.
You have come to Faizabad for a day..
..and you have spoiled your father's name.
Mother!
Mother!
Don't say like this I am your child.
Your Ameeran.
- Ameeran has already died.
She would not have spoiled our repute.
Ok Mother, you have removed me from your heart.
Before forgetting me, you should have slapped me.
Once, when I had lost a ring, you had slapped me.
Now, I have lost my honor, dignity, house and my family.
Everything.
Beat me.
Beat me to your heart's content.
Why don't you beat me?
I had forgotten.. ones own is beaten up, isn't it?
Yes, you are not our own.
She will not beat you due to her motherly care.
But I will surely satisfy your desire.
Not just a slap but I can strangle your neck.
The way in which you have defamed..
..the repute of the family, you don't have the right to live.
Jamal!
Before becoming a courtesan you should have committed suicide.
I was very small when that scoundrel Dilawar had taken me away.
I couldn't make out what is right and wrong.
Then how could I understand what is life and death?
But now you do understand.
Then why have you come here to defame and give us grief.
Maybe to find Ameeran who was lost in the dirt of life.
Or to cry with my own people before I die.
Don't try to cry out to the thoughts which we have buried.
Get out of Faizabad.
For ever!
Since my birth, no one considered me as a sister.
I had a brother.. even he is sending..
..me back to the same profession.
Yes, I had come in search of Ameeran.
For a few moments I met Ameeran.
But she vanished again.
Se was very innocent and a bit crazy too.
She used to say, that I will never get married and leave this house.
I will never leave this house and family and go away.
I am leaving" if it is possible, then forgive that crazy girl.
Tell me, have you seen such a farewell?
Nor mother, nor father, nor brother.
No one is there.
Tears are the ornaments and the palanquin of sorrow.
The locked doors are bidding farewell to me.
Never return here even in your dreams.
Never return here even in your dreams.
Don't bring me back as a daughter in my next birth.
Whatever you have done now, Oh God!
Don't do it again.
Don't bring me back as a daughter in my next birth.
Don't bring me back as a daughter in my next birth.
Did you see mister, Ameeran from Faizabad..
..has returned as Lucknow's Umrao Jaan.
You can say that the bride has come from..
..her in-laws to her mother's home.
In-laws!
And that too what sort of in-laws!
I had just one desire that I could be lucky.
I could get love from someone among this whole world.
I could not achieve anything in my whole life, people of this world.
Now at least give me the permission to bid my funeral.
They are asking, the inquirers are asking.
They are asking, the inquirers are asking.
But what can I answer?
But what can I answer?
The blots which are on my heart.
The blots which are on my heart.
How do I explain them?
How do I explain them?
They are asking, the inquirers are asking.
How many blots are there on my soul?
How many blots are there on my head?
How many blots are there on my soul?
How many blots are there on my head?
Those who could give affection to me.
It is true that how will they accept me.
How my heart has been tainted.
But how can I answer.
They are asking, the inquirers are asking.
The place which was once mine is now a place of strangers.
The place which was once mine is now a place of strangers.
Who is here to listen to me.
How can I tell my sorrows.
How my heart has been tainted.
But how can I answer.
They are asking, the inquirers are asking.
Why are you stoning me now?
I am already wounded.
Why are you stoning me now?
I am already wounded.
How can I show, how many wounds are on my heart.
Let it be how can I make you count them.
How my heart has been tainted.
How do I explain them?
They are asking, the inquirers are asking.
Go there.
Go there.
Coachman, why did you stop?
Someone is lying on the road.
- Who?
I'll just see, madam.
Looks like a leper.
- You!
Get up!
Get up!
You leper.
Leave him.
Leave him.
For God's sake, give me something.
lam very hungry.
Give me something.
Have pity on Baba.
Have pity on me, dear.
Give me something, have pity.
Give me something, dear.
Whoever you are you are an angel, dear.
You have lots of pity within you.
God listens to people like you.
If it is possible pray for me, clear.
lam a big culprit.
lam a big culprit.
Oh God!
Oh God!
Forgive me!
And Umrao Jaan bid good bye to Faizabad forever.
I wish to say many things.
But maybe I am unable to say.
I don't understand what name should I give to this tale.
Should I call it Ameeran's story or Umrao's.
Anyway, what a saga of life it is.
If you could summarise the saga of life in your own words..
.. I would be highly grateful to you.
Let some one ask is there any..
..end to the saga of ill fate.
Let some one ask is there any..
..end to the saga of ill fate.
Then give my example..
..and present my case.
Then give my example..
..and present my case.
You are under my oath, don't have craving for me.
If I am not able to meet you, don't have desire for me.
Wow...

I don't enjoy a good repute
But, you famed as wrongdoer
Oh..."Excellent"
But, authority to say such words is only enjoyed by Omrao Jaan.

Who is Omrao, whose life I am?
And what is special in me?
I was Ameeran who was grown in FaizAbad
Till today

Yes...

Now, listen the story of that innocent, Ameeran"
Sister...

The ceremony is nearto end I don't undersand about magic of that tree on you
That you play all day underthat
Don't say the tree bad...
Ameeran's mother

Please don't beat me, please
No...
No...
Come here close to me I will not beat you I am like your mother

Your home is too far, honey
And you don't know the way
The outside world is very crual
Therefore, nevertry to go anywhere
Until I am, I will not let you feel the lack of your mom, dad, etc.
Stop here, I am just coming
See this...
What is in it?
See these dresses
And see these bangles
Are'nt they beautiful?
Yes
Wearthese
Good girl take these
and these
Now, will you run away?
No...
Very good
And you forgotten your parents against such precious dresses and bangles
Drink this
Again thanks
And more and more I was plunged in comforts
Just think
A girl who never even thought about such comforts
Who never eaten betterthan traditional sweets would'nt 've gone made if she wears and eats like princess
I found some new friends
Bismillah, Khurshid, and Gohar I wished to be like those after seeing them
Aunt and teacher never gave us room to remember our parents
Hey... daughter...
What are you doing?
To keep cart in this position is'nt considered to be good
What happens aunt?
Daughter...
After death of someone, his or her cart is positioned such
Now, today I teach you regarding ourtraditions and culture
Now go and get freshed
Education started
And I learnt good manners alongwith education, too
Aunt, Hussaini, taught how to talk
And teachertaught about poetry
Mr. Khan taught about singing
And Guru taught how to sing
Time passed like a flash and I left behind my childhood
And puberty knocked the door of my body
Gohar, Mirza...
What is this joke?
I can'nt see my face that is fine if you can'nt see yourface
Your beautiful face does'nt need the mirror
You liar I am not that beautiful
as Bismillah, Khurshid, and Ameer
Whose lovers take care of those
Their lovers give them new dresses, new bangles money, servants, etc.
On daily basis
And if mistakenly I reach to see them
Omrao great that you 're here.
Please take that ashtray here
So force me to go away
Do you know why?
She is afraid of you that their lover might turn to you
One can'nt wish to see the face otherthan yours after seeing you it is your misperception
Their lovers do care of their hairs, too
And I 've to do this all myself I can help you out if you permit
Yes
What the hell is this?
Why you touched me such?
So what's wrong
Have I touched you first time?
Don't talk about childhood that was other case
And the childhood has been left much behind
Hey... you damn...
What the hell are you doing?
Get lost now
Dear Aunt, I was straightening Omrao's hair at her request
Don't tell lie I know you very well
You always try to be nearto girls
And so was yourfather
He was lord of just name
Listen Aunt, Don't say anything about my dad
OKay... now you get lost from here
Go from here
Say what you want this is yourtime
I feel mercy and rage at same time for him
Why you called him?
Whatelse I could do?
I was sick of such dry hairs
You, too, don't 've any time for me
Even no one has time for me
Not even Madam Khanum
Don't frustrate, daughter Days will turn good soon
Omrao's time has yet to come
What's wrong daughter?
Your eyes are tearing
This is not good at all
Nothing special
Just heard a childhood song
God please don't make me a girl in my next life
Now childhood has gone
That language has ended, too
Tell me any of your new poem
Yes, say
Okay...
listen
Recite
Your eyes can make insane to anyone
Could make bowl lf fell on stone
Wow...
Excellent
But, daughter change eyes with sight
Eyes don't fell, but vision
this just can be scrutinized by a teacher
Thanks
No... don't say just thanks, but help me as I did to you
How I can help you?
Why not?
Then please order
There is a part of verse
For whom I left the world
Please make the second verse of it
For whom I left the world
See, he has left me for world

Say...
What do you want?
Should I demand?
Yes...
Will you?
Then please give me some traditional sweet
Sweets

What you thinking, Sir?
You 've tied me for whole life
If life is with me

Always keep one thing in your mind forever, Bismillah
There is no value of emotions and relations in this profession
I always keep in mind your comforts

But Omrao's love is for a luckiest person
And we will allow the right person
Who will pay the most

Not far...
We will be nearby with you
And dearthis home is not suitable foryou now

Try to learn how to live with yourself
Go daughter... that palace is waiting foryou
A new whole world is waiting foryou
Wait
Take this
Keep this mirror with you
Leave happilly
How I could admire you...
Omrao
Yesterday's dance was as like a thrilling dance
Don't admire too much
My God knows that you are more admireable than this lt is true Omrao I am very happy today in years
This is truth as I 've always seen you very sad
Yes, the lovers are like me... sad
But...
Love is always happy
Yes
But seperation and distances are life threatening l pray to God to save you from such situation
But You will realize as you will love
Omrao...
Khanum is coming
Live long Omrao
Your dance has been instilled in to extent in Lord's heart that he is ready to pay as per our wish
He will come today and will spend night with you
So take care of him well
Hey...
Omrao now you 've found your Lord, too
But who is this Lord, Sultan
Will be an old person, nearto die
He will give his life for Omrao
Omrao...
Lord Sultan is coming to you
How he looks?
Like this
Send him
Come in, Sir
Take a message from heart...
Turn your face and accept regards
you
So You are
Yes...
Why are you surprised?
Actually, here all were guessing that
Lord Sultan would be an old man
Take this
No Thanks
Would you like to drink?
Not at all
Then what would you like?
I like good thrilling girls
And that is all in you
You chat nicely
Come closer and sit here
What are you thinking?
In thousand years billions of men have seen the moon in sky
But I think I am first person
Who has hugged moonlight in his arms
My apologies
Dear Lord...
Come here your party is ready
No need to be in hurry
Take a seat please, Sir?
Congratulations
Our Omrao has become Omrao Jaan
Take sweet please
You 've told a good news
But keep in mind that she has to keep in herfist Lord Sultan forever
that he would'nt be able to leave her
Such big lords do'nt come here usually
Okay...
Madam...
I will say her
Khurshid congratulations...
Take sweet
Khurshid congratulations...
Take sweet
Our Omrao has become Omrao Jaan
Much Congratulations Aunt
Hey...
What's wrong with you, Mr. Gohar?
Leave it and take sweets
Our Omrao has become Omrao Jaan
No aunt I took a bittertablet yesterday night
Let me completely taste the bitterness
Hey...
You...
let that remain bitter
I 've listened that Lord Sultan is coming again today
Listened exactly right
Hence Omrao is confused, what she has to wear?
It seems that Omrao Jaan has fallen in love with Lord Sultan I think so
Well
But Khanum wants that you do your beauty magic on him that you would become his weakness
And if he would become my weakness Then...
Then... keep cool your heart
Otherwise, will make the same mistake as mine lf the love is a mistake, then let it be
What a beauty is she?
When did you come?
I never went
Really
Let me see
Come closerto me
What are you looking?
My fate?
Not at all...
But ring
Wanted to see if you have worn it
Please keep it forever in yourfinger
And if you lost it... you will be beaten
Who will beat me?
I myself.
Really
So you have fallen such deep in love
More deeperthan that
When I was child I lost an ordinary ring
And my mom slapped me hard
You would have felt much pain
Not that much, but I cried a lot
Okay tell me how was your sleep last night
Not at all
Yourthoughts kept me awakened
I spent whole night in thinking about my curer
Promise me
You will see me daily as long as is our life
I would promise, but would be very difficult to comply it
Why?
Because my dad has fixed my marriage with Saba
Saba yes
Who is this Saba?
Daughter of my mother's sister
You love someone else besides me lt is like a death message for me
Please go away
Please leave me alone
Give me back that symbol of love, that ring
First you give me back my ring
Never
Why
Because I have loved
And will keep this ring with me for whole life
Give me back ring and please go
Cool...
Cool Omrao I am not going to marry with someone else
Just want to see how much you love me
Means you were suspecious about my love
No absolutely not
Now there is not a single doubt
I promise that I will live with you forever
And will see me daily
Yes, of course
Okay...
Now since I 've given my promise to you
Now I want to talk to you
Here daily
At your place the sales of bodies, promises, etc.
Are settelled on daily basis
Can you assure me that you would limit yourself just to me
Its means you consider me like all other dancers
I did'nt born at this place and not even like other girls here
I was Ameeran and now Omrao Jaan
And I, too, am lover of that Ameeran
Who was born in a FaizAbad unfortunate home
And was brought here unintentionally
Surprised...
I know everything about you
Now... please make your mood cool
No...
First tell me how is your Saba?
is she more beautiful than me?
yes very much
That I think that I am not appropriate for her
Strange
You are not appropriate for her and I am not foryou
So what will happen?
I did'nt say that you are not acceptable to me
You just said me unfaithful
First you said me unfaithful
The difference is just
That you would remain Lord whetheryou are faithful or not
And me even pursuing loyality, would remain prostitute
Since you are with me it seems like
Hey man where are you going?
Don't you know this Omrao Jaan bedroom
Yes, I know, and therefore going in
Who are you?
And what's problem with you?
Don't you see I am with a guest
No problem, the guest can be shown exit way I can give double than what he has given
You are a very indecent person I think you don't know how to talk mannerly?
Great...
You 're talking about manners while sitting with a prostitute on her place
You are crossing your limits
So please keep quiet
Otherwise, I will crush you I 've seen many like you
Come here, closerto me...
Omrao Jaan
He killed me
What you 've done this
Afzal...
Take him to doctor quickly
What will happen now?
Dear Sir, you please leave this place
We will take care all of this stuff I will not go
Will face every matter by myself
You please go
I cordially request you to leave this place now
Why?
Scared...
You are with a pathan
Nothing is greaterthan your life
Leaving just because foryou
He left that place on my request
But then till many days he did'nt come nor any news about him I continued to pray for seeing him
I swear God... this sadness does'nt suite you
What one can do when sadness is in fate lf l change your sadness in hapiness then
Will you reward me?
You know the name of my hapiness
Yes, I know
That unfaithful Sultan I 've an update about him
Tell me please
First reward
He says that "l can'nt come, but you can"
Where?
At his friend's home l know the address
Take me there please
But...
Khanum I will take care of her
May God bless you
Daughter...
Hi...
Sir
Take you sweets please
You kept remember my sweets
But why are you in so hurry.
.
Where are you going?
I can'nt tell you lie
Going to see Lord Sultan
That Pathan
Yes
He seems a pious person
Do you like him?
May God help you...
Go... go
My eyes are looking foryou
Hi...
Hi
He is my friend Ashraf...
And this.
Omrao
My friend has just one name on his tongue and that is Omrao
Madam this is my home
And I don't want to be in between both you...
Take care
Yourfriend is very interesting
Yes...
He knows that love tale is very long
And the time is very short
So he left
Two moments of love are greaterthan whole life
You talks as magically as your eyes
Where is Omrao?
...
Call hertoo
She is not here, has gone somewhere
Where?
To mee Lord Sultan at his friend's home
How did she dare to go?
Did'nt you stop her?
I tried my best to stop her...
But
Nothing is greaterthan love for her
Bismillah...
Try to learn the manners of singing by Khurshid
Who was she?
Omrao Jaan, "the famous dancer of Lucknow"
Raisaa...
You 've come back Omrao...
Where did you go?
To meet Lord Sultan at his friend's home
Without my permission
You know well that no one can enter or exit without my permission from this place
This is Khanum Jaan palace
Sultan is a self-esteem and wise person
Knows very well that he is to pay to Khanum Jaan for my time
This is the price
Do you consider it cruelty?
No... your bless is raining
Good and neverforget my this blessings...
Omrao Jaan
Of course...
Khanum...
What's matter Omrao?
Why Khanum is angry to you?
What I can tell?
I did a sin by meeting Lord Sultan
So finally you 've fallen in love
I think so
May God bless on us
We are love traders...
But
We 've no right to do love
But I am helpless
Therefore, I 've written these verses
Yes, please...
Tell me
To sacrifice life for someone was necessary
Life can'nt be spent without it
Excellent
We were deeply in love
Our wishes were completing
That we could'nt see anything except each other ljust started a good dream that
I 've written some verses
Please, tell
One cleverthief stolen my heart
While all guardes remained sleeping
Now...
Should I too yes
One cleverthief stolen my heart
I knew that you would say such
Lord... ..
Mr.ShujatLordhascome and would like to see you
Send him in...
What will happen now?
Hi...
You...
I think... are probably Omrao...
"a dancer, prostitute"
Yes lt would be great if would leave my son alone...
NOW I 've to talk to my son seperately
Take care
Dad...
You 've insulted Omrao by sending her out lt is just not her insult, but mine too
And I 've not liked this
OH...
So Omrao insult is your insult
And what's about your incompliance to my advices I advised you, not to meet Omrao again I love Omrao
Love...... .
Dear Son the love is that feeling
Which originates from a father's prayer and a mother's breastfeeding
The love, which is bought by money ls not a love, but a greed
Dad... ..
Please
Now you are blaiming our love morale and purity
Only God knows that how much our love is immaterial and pure
And you are not God
Sultan... ..
You are now crossing the limits
Don'nt forget that the money you are giving to her is not yours
But mine I can deprive you from all my wealth
No problem...
Go ahead
But I can'nt leave Omrao
Okay...
Fine
Then right now I deprive you from my wealth my life, home and every relation with me
You...
Why have you come...
is everything okay?
No...
It is not good...
His father reached there and was in much anger, wanted to talk to Sultan lonely
So what?
My heart is beating rapidly since then
You please go and inquire what happened
Me...?
Please... come back fast...
I am waiting
Alas...
Mr. Goha...
She is asking to inquire about your enemy
Omrao...
What is update?
Why don'nt you speak?
is there bad news?
Not so bad...
But not too good
Please tell
They argued a lot and his father deprived him from all his wealth, life,
and from home
But why?
Lord Sultan is in love with you
While his father does'nt even want to listen your name
Please leave me alone
Please come in...
Are you sure that your Lord Sultan will come
Dear Khanum this Lord Faiz Ali
Regards...
Please take a seat
Ladies first
May God bless you.
What is this?
Yes, I 've understand
But I 've listened that such arms are the cause of fame of some places
But belive me...
This gun is useless...
It can'nt fire
Okay...
Shut this topic and give me your wrist
Now tell which girl would you like?
Omrao Jaan
Omrao Jaan...
Would'nt you give me something to eat?
I am here because of Omrao Jaan's beauty
Dear Khanum please tell him I can'nt entertain him I am just for Lord Sultan
And I am very faithful to him
Have you heard now I excuse you for her as she is very loyal to him
Anyhow...
It is enough that I 've seen Omrao...
She is beautiful
Dear Faiz Ali we 've some more girls here
Such as Khurshid, Bismillah, Husna, Zeenat, etc.
You can chose any of them
No...
Unfortunatley, ljust love Omrao
And Omrao loves someone else
But I am not hopeless I will see her again if life is with me
Furthermore
This is the price of Omrao's one view and yourtime thanks
Thanks foryour such response
Good bye

Somewhat rude, but is a rich person
Would you listen me please

Lord Sultan
Sit nearto us l was informed that you came last night
And you were not feeling well
How are you feeling now?
I am fine now
But what was wrong?
Nothing special
We heard that you argued with yourfather
Dear Son...
It happens in every home
Don't worry...
But whatever I know all the wealth is in his custody
Which he spends as per his mood
But Khanum Madam
You please keep quiet I was telling him reality
Dear Lord we dancer run this palace just because of you lords
Otherwise, what we can do?
If we would love someone then how we will live without money
We 've just one relationship with others and that is because of money
You said correctly
Dear Khanum... please
You again interrupted me
Okay leave this topic...
See these beautiful cloaks lt would be great if you pay for one cloak for me its price is 5000
Now tell how I can arrange such huge money?
Hl... .
Dear Khanum
Faiz Ali...
Hi
Please come in
Khanum I am not able to pay for this cloak at the moment
And I feel no embarrassment by telling you that I 've nothing
This embrassement is for all Lords of Lucknow
Alas: my bad time that I am begging for just on cloak to you
Take this necklace...
Lord Sultan gave it to me
Buy the cloak against it
She is lying I didn't give it to her
Lord Sultan... you are our respectable guest
Live here as long as you wish
But if someone rebuke you forthis that such a rich Lord is underthe pity of a prostitute
Then I will crush him
Excuse me...
The matter is beyond limit now
Take it
And give cloak to dear Khanum
Okay Sir.
And I will buy one more
For Omrao Jaan
And if you both wish to buy...
Then I can pay forthose, too
I 've to leave now
But one thing I would like to say before leaving
That by comapring the love with money
You just not 've insulted me, but whole mankind
Oh...
It seems that you 're not habitual to heartruth
The truth is this, Dear Khanum
That I am Lord Sultan
And you are just a owner of this whore's house
Hey...
Listen...
Where are you going?
Please Stop... I will go with you, too
No...
Omrao I can'nt take you with me
You would 've to wait for me here they have insulted you I can't live with them for a moment
So, would you increase my tension?
My life is in the dark
Try to understand I can fight against whole world but can't go against fate
Its ourfate, i have to endeavor
And u have to wait
This wait will kill me
Good bye
What is this?
Get ready
Faiz Ali is waitting foryou downstair
But khanum I am for Lord Sultan
Forget him
Lord Sultan is a dream foryou
And whore is not for dreaming
But to let others dream
TO entertain the people
Lord Sultan is not dream but reality
And I love him
Love... ..
Thisluxeriouslife is due to money, but not by love
Ok
Lord Sultan will return and bring the money I don't know the future, talk about present
Lord Sultan is short of money and Faiz Ali full of money
Forget Lord Sultan, take the hand of Faiz Ali lt is in the interst of you and me
Don't cry, we all suffer
You and me
Aunt, you too
Here is your keep (Whore)
Keep
You are my heart's queen
Who has been sold that can't be queen
This can be decided by my heart
No one else
But nobody will listen my heart's decision why not?
I will listen and forever I will not give up to find the happiness ln which happiness you are in find, its dead body
And dead body is to burry
Not for love
For GOD sake, don't say like this, kill me
But don't kill my endeavor I must find my happiness
NO... .
Faiz Ali
You were right
Without heart you 're like a dead body
But I 've to get your love first
Or will permanenlty make you dead
Mr. Ashraf...
Stop...
Stop
Regards...

Mr. Faiz Ali
We were trying to arrest forfor many years
And finally we arrested you
We 're chasing you since last night
We 've arrested all your compansions
And now is your number
Take them all to Gari...
These women, too
Son, Sultan your all worries were in just Lucknow
Therefore, I took you here
But it seems Lucknow people's are following you here too
Has my dad come?
No...
Dear not your dad, but Omrao
Omrao
But she is not alone
She has been arrested with complete team of Faiz Ali, great robber
And is in our custody
Faiz Ali, robber...
But He is a Lord
No dear...
He is a great robber
Whom we were seeking for long time I don't believe this
Dear son Sultan
Don't see the innocency of faces
Faces sometimes don't reflect exact picture
Can I see them?
Why not?
And He left the home to meet me lt seemed like my fate is coming to see me
Once again I was humilated... .
In life...
Before reaching to me...
He met to Faiz Ali first
Sultan...
Gari
Now I understand
Thanks for coming
Thanks for what
I am feeling pity foryou
Finally, I 've seen your real picture
Lord Faiz Ali...
A robber
Where are youg going, Sutlan Khan?
Mind your business
Means...
If you 're going to see Omrao Jaan
Then first take my permission
As she is my bought, Keep (whore)
What the hell you are talking?
As you left her she became mine
I am not interested to hear about her
You would be happy to hearthat she is with me on her will
She is a whore
And a whore's belives just in money
Just money
And you know a robber can'nt be short of money
You are lying
Ask her directly what is truth
I swear...
She has just my name on her lips
Faiz Ali
Don't you believe this?
Come here
If you don't belive this then please see her right leg
She has a big mole there
And I am sure that you, too, 've seen that mole
Omrao...
You would remain alive, but like a deadbody
Madam...
Lord Sultan wants to see you
Omrao Jaan is here, Sir
You people may go now
She is in our custody now
You...
Why have you drunk?
Now I am with you
I drank forthe first time because I left the whole world and came to you
But I 've drunk today because
I am leaving you today
Seperating
You 're kidding
Kidding can be with dearests
Not... ..
Withstrangers
So we are stranger now
Will you make someone else your wife?
I am going to marry Saba
When I came to know that you are in Gari I feared that something is going to happen, as it has
I ask you...
Where 're those promises, love, comittments
That ring, the symbol of our love
Why 're you throwing me out of your life?
What is my fault?
What I 've done wrong with you?
I 've the right to demand answer
You had the right
To that Omrao who was faithfull
But, Alas!
She died
As she became unfaithful to me for just money
What are you saying?
Do you remember one thing?
As long as you will be unfaithful
This Pathan will crush you
I 've just met your buyer, Faiz Ali, a robber
God knows that ljust asked for help from sjust to meet you
By selling your soul
By selling your body
This is not truth
He is misguiding you
Am I a fool?
He can define ups and downs of your body thoroughly
Even he knows about that mole
Hope you know...
Which mole I am talking about
Would you like to hear more
Speak
Give me answer
Oh... my luck
This is not truth
Believe me this is not truth
Please send him to Lucknow back with respect
I will not forget yourthis favor for my whole life
You let me dreamed to be out of that golden cage
And sending me back to that cage today again
As I am going out of your life
Would you give me anotherfavor?
As you 've ignored me today instead of my love ln such way in my love cry for once
Oh God...
How is that fire?
The crop has been cut so the fire is up to burn the remaining useless stuff
Khushid... .
Omrao
How were you Gohar?
I am fine now, as you 've come
How are you?
Thanks God
We 've heard everything
The facts about Faiz Ali and Sultan's dysloyality
I wish that you could 've learnt with my condition
The life teaches too much, Khurshid
The pain and it is fine with me
May I ask you one thing?
Did you remember us?
I did'nt forget you I swear...
We missed you a lot
Like two sisters argue at home, but if one is married, the other remains worry about her
Where is Khanum?
She is inside, not feeling well
Hey...
Omrao
Dear Khanum
You got back, daughter
How is your health?
I knew that you would must get back
You can'nt face the dreadful face of world
Did you see dreadful face of world
Khanum Dear I am not going to ask you, hence you need to tell anything
Honey...
This home is yours and you can live here for whole life
How are you feeling now?
Daughter has come back and so mother will be fine
Aunt... ..
Dear Sir.
Who has positioned wrongly this cart?
No my daughter
Leave it in that position
Your great teacher has been died
So you got back ln whom search you went to Gari...
He married someone else
That is great...
I think God want both of us to be married
What the hell your 're talking?
You 've drunk...
God knows that I don't 've such emotions foryou
Then have now
I am not so bad
What 're you doing, Gohar?
Come to your senses
Omrao Jaan, Do you know, What I 've done foryou?
I lost all my wealth foryou
Worked as you said and just waited for such moment
I was trying to recoverthat
That another storm knocked
A big storm
Which encircled the whole country
English soldiers attacked on Lucknow in search of rebels, too
That was a biggest mess of disaster
The rebels are uniting again in all over India
The British army has conquered Delhi
And they are moving towards up
They 've reached till Lucknow
Oh...
God save us and our Lucknow
God will bless us lt is very hard time
Yes, May God bless us
Where is this Gohar......
I 've not seen him for many days
Forget him...
Madam...
What happened...
Gohar
Blood...
How it happened?
I am not alone, Khanum...
All Lucknow is in blood
British army has sent big tanks to kill the rebels
Poeples are being hanged and children are tied on trees
Oh God... it is horrible
Hey...
Go and take medicine for him
Khanum...
Don't worry about me
No body is secure in Lucknow, now

The ceremony is nearto end I don't undersand about magic of that tree on you
That you play all day underthat
Don't say the tree bad...
Ameeran's mother
That is like you

My daugther... ..
Your dad will buy that again.
Don't cry.

Really.
lnsisting to fix Ameeran's wedding date
Has Ameeran slept?
Yes, she has slept
But her marriage will be too costly.
How we will meet that cost?
They people 've assessed us wrongly
Ourthis big home creates a wrong impression of our richness
They don't know that I inherited this
Anyhow, the wedding is to be done
No one can keep daughter at home for whole life
We 've to send Ameeran with her husband
Raissa...

There was no aunt there
But just empty room
Dad... .
Mom... please save me

Let's move Pir Bakhsh
And that day I saw my dad last time
He, rascal, is very innocent or is very clever

Your revenge with some money will be completed
Say... how is the idea?
Hey... you are very clever, friend
Golden cage foryour parrot
Why not?
If you order Mrs. Khanam I can decorate this with some pearls, too
But why?
Golden cage to live and pearls to eat
Why are you jealous to my parrot?

No I 've not come as per my will.
These people 've kidnapped me
Oh... my honey

How much worry will be her parents?
These rascals don't mercy while kidnapping
Without having fear of God I am not faulty...
She would be sold to someone else if not me
Khanum Mam...

Demand... how much
Just 200
Oh my God...
The cops will give you 200 l will give you only 100

Your name is Omrao from now onward
Let's go now
Omrao... yes
Wow...
let's move now
Ameeran daughter...
Where are you?
I 've taken sweets foryou
Ameeran?
Dad... dad... dad
Hey...
What happened, daughter?
It seems you 've dreamed badly
The dream was very good
You saw yourfather in dream
Yeah
Come on my child...
Go to sleep
Omrao... where are you going?
Please don't beat me, please
No...
No...
Come here close to me I will not beat you I am like your mother
Where did you want to go?
to home
Your home is too far, honey
And you don't know the way
The outside world is very crual
Therefore, nevertry to go anywhere
Until I am, I will not let you feel the lack of your mom, dad, etc.
Stop here, I am just coming
See this...
What is in it?
See these dresses
And see these bangles
Are'nt they beautiful?
Yes
Wearthese
Good girl take these
and these
Now, will you run away?
No...
Very good
And you forgotten your parents against such precious dresses and bangles
Drink this
Again thanks
And more and more I was plunged in comforts
Just think
A girl who never even thought about such comforts
Who never eaten betterthan traditional sweets would'nt 've gone made if she wears and eats like princess
I found some new friends
Bismillah, Khurshid, and Gohar I wished to be like those after seeing them
Aunt and teacher never gave us room to remember our parents
Hey... daughter...
What are you doing?
To keep cart in this position is'nt considered to be good
What happens aunt?
Daughter...
After death of someone, his or her cart is positioned such
Now, today I teach you regarding ourtraditions and culture
Now go and get freshed
Education started
And I learnt good manners alongwith education, too
Aunt, Hussaini, taught how to talk
And teachertaught about poetry
Mr. Khan taught about singing
And Guru taught how to sing
Time passed like a flash and I left behind my childhood
And puberty knocked the door of my body
Gohar, Mirza...
What is this joke?
I can'nt see my face that is fine if you can'nt see yourface
Your beautiful face does'nt need the mirror
You liar I am not that beautiful
as Bismillah, Khurshid, and Ameer
Whose lovers take care of those
Their lovers give them new dresses, new bangles money, servants, etc.
On daily basis
And if mistakenly I reach to see them
Omrao great that you 're here.
Please take that ashtray here
So force me to go away
Do you know why?
She is afraid of you that their lover might turn to you
One can'nt wish to see the face otherthan yours after seeing you it is your misperception
Their lovers do care of their hairs, too
And I 've to do this all myself I can help you out if you permit
Yes
What the hell is this?
Why you touched me such?
So what's wrong
Have I touched you first time?
Don't talk about childhood that was other case
And the childhood has been left much behind
Hey... you damn...
What the hell are you doing?
Get lost now
Dear Aunt, I was straightening Omrao's hair at her request
Don't tell lie I know you very well
You always try to be nearto girls
And so was yourfather
He was lord of just name
Listen Aunt, Don't say anything about my dad
OKay... now you get lost from here
Go from here
Say what you want this is yourtime
I feel mercy and rage at same time for him
Why you called him?
Whatelse I could do?
I was sick of such dry hairs
You, too, don't 've any time for me
Even no one has time for me
Not even Madam Khanum
Don't frustrate, daughter Days will turn good soon
Omrao's time has yet to come
What's wrong daughter?
Your eyes are tearing
This is not good at all
Nothing special
Just heard a childhood song
God please don't make me a girl in my next life
Now childhood has gone
That language has ended, too
Tell me any of your new poem
Yes, say
Okay...
listen
Recite
Your eyes can make insane to anyone
Could make bowl lf fell on stone
Wow...
Excellent
But, daughter change eyes with sight
Eyes don't fell, but vision
this just can be scrutinized by a teacher
Thanks
No... don't say just thanks, but help me as I did to you
How I can help you?
Why not?
Then please order
There is a part of verse
For whom I left the world
Please make the second verse of it
For whom I left the world
See, he has left me for world
Oh...
Great
What a brain you 've?
I long to reward you today
Say...
What do you want?
Should I demand?
Yes...
Will you?
Then please give me some traditional sweet
Sweets
My father used to give me every evening
What you thinking, Sir?
You 've tied me for whole life
If life is with me
Then my love is always with you
But you will not take sweets
Yes, of course
Daughter, keep it with you
This ring will always protect you

Madam Khanum
Congratulations...
Apologize in advance
But this is not good
You 've degraded all of us by chosing Omrao
Khanum always do things with complete understanding
You could chose me too, as I am your own blood
Always keep one thing in your mind forever, Bismillah
There is no value of emotions and relations in this profession
I always keep in mind your comforts
Our club will be famed by Omrao's name
And fame is door of money
God has instilled great love in heart
Abundance of love
And that all for just one person
Wow... that is great
Which night my first dance was in a stree of Lucknow I found that person

Many people have seen her
Therefore, city's richmen and lords are requesting that
Give them Omrao for one night
But Omrao's love is for a luckiest person
And we will allow the right person
Who will pay the most
Omrao is very costy
You will be transferred to another luxurous home today

A new whole world is waiting foryou

How I could admire you...
Omrao
Yesterday's dance was as like a thrilling dance
Don't admire too much
My God knows that you are more admireable than this lt is true Omrao I am very happy today in years
This is truth as I 've always seen you very sad
Yes, the lovers are like me... sad
But...
Love is always happy
Yes
But seperation and distances are life threatening l pray to God to save you from such situation
But You will realize as you will love
Omrao...
Khanum is coming

But who is this Lord, Sultan
Will be an old person, nearto die

Omrao...
Lord Sultan is coming to you
How he looks?
Like this
Send him
Come in, Sir
Take a message from heart...
Turn your face and accept regards

So You are
Yes...
Why are you surprised?
Actually, here all were guessing that
Lord Sultan would be an old man
Take this
No Thanks
Would you like to drink?
Not at all
Then what would you like?
I like good thrilling girls
And that is all in you
You chat nicely
Come closer and sit here
What are you thinking?
In thousand years billions of men have seen the moon in sky
But I think I am first person
Who has hugged moonlight in his arms
My apologies
Dear Lord...
Come here your party is ready
No need to be in hurry
Take a seat please, Sir?
Congratulations
Our Omrao has become Omrao Jaan
Take sweet please
You 've told a good news
But keep in mind that she has to keep in herfist Lord Sultan forever
that he would'nt be able to leave her
Such big lords do'nt come here usually
Okay...
Madam...
I will say her
Khurshid congratulations...
Take sweet
Khurshid congratulations...
Take sweet
Our Omrao has become Omrao Jaan
Much Congratulations Aunt
Hey...
What's wrong with you, Mr. Gohar?
Leave it and take sweets
Our Omrao has become Omrao Jaan
No aunt I took a bittertablet yesterday night
Let me completely taste the bitterness
Hey...
You...
let that remain bitter
I 've listened that Lord Sultan is coming again today
Listened exactly right
Hence Omrao is confused, what she has to wear?
It seems that Omrao Jaan has fallen in love with Lord Sultan I think so
Well
But Khanum wants that you do your beauty magic on him that you would become his weakness
And if he would become my weakness Then...
Then... keep cool your heart
Otherwise, will make the same mistake as mine lf the love is a mistake, then let it be
What a beauty is she?
When did you come?
I never went
Really
Let me see
Come closerto me
What are you looking?
My fate?
Not at all...
But ring
Wanted to see if you have worn it
Please keep it forever in yourfinger
And if you lost it... you will be beaten
Who will beat me?
I myself.
Really
So you have fallen such deep in love
More deeperthan that
When I was child I lost an ordinary ring
And my mom slapped me hard
You would have felt much pain
Not that much, but I cried a lot
Okay tell me how was your sleep last night
Not at all
Yourthoughts kept me awakened
I spent whole night in thinking about my curer
Promise me
You will see me daily as long as is our life
I would promise, but would be very difficult to comply it
Why?
Because my dad has fixed my marriage with Saba
Saba yes
Who is this Saba?
Daughter of my mother's sister
You love someone else besides me lt is like a death message for me
Please go away
Please leave me alone
Give me back that symbol of love, that ring
First you give me back my ring
Never
Why
Because I have loved
And will keep this ring with me for whole life
Give me back ring and please go
Cool...
Cool Omrao I am not going to marry with someone else
Just want to see how much you love me
Means you were suspecious about my love
No absolutely not
Now there is not a single doubt
I promise that I will live with you forever
And will see me daily
Yes, of course
Okay...
Now since I 've given my promise to you
Now I want to talk to you
Here daily
At your place the sales of bodies, promises, etc.
Are settelled on daily basis
Can you assure me that you would limit yourself just to me
Its means you consider me like all other dancers
I did'nt born at this place and not even like other girls here
I was Ameeran and now Omrao Jaan
And I, too, am lover of that Ameeran
Who was born in a FaizAbad unfortunate home
And was brought here unintentionally
Surprised...
I know everything about you
Now... please make your mood cool
No...
First tell me how is your Saba?
is she more beautiful than me?
yes very much
That I think that I am not appropriate for her
Strange
You are not appropriate for her and I am not foryou
So what will happen?
I did'nt say that you are not acceptable to me
You just said me unfaithful
First you said me unfaithful
The difference is just
That you would remain Lord whetheryou are faithful or not
And me even pursuing loyality, would remain prostitute
Since you are with me it seems like
Hey man where are you going?
Don't you know this Omrao Jaan bedroom
Yes, I know, and therefore going in
Who are you?
And what's problem with you?
Don't you see I am with a guest
No problem, the guest can be shown exit way I can give double than what he has given
You are a very indecent person I think you don't know how to talk mannerly?
Great...
You 're talking about manners while sitting with a prostitute on her place
You are crossing your limits
So please keep quiet
Otherwise, I will crush you I 've seen many like you
Come here, closerto me...
Omrao Jaan
He killed me
What you 've done this
Afzal...
Take him to doctor quickly
What will happen now?
Dear Sir, you please leave this place
We will take care all of this stuff
I will not go
Will face every matter by myself
You please go
I cordially request you to leave this place now
Why?
Scared...
You are with a pathan
Nothing is greaterthan your life
Leaving just because foryou
He left that place on my request
But then till many days he did'nt come nor any news about him I continued to pray for seeing him
I swear God... this sadness does'nt suite you
What one can do when sadness is in fate lf l change your sadness in hapiness then
Will you reward me?
You know the name of my hapiness
Yes, I know
That unfaithful Sultan I 've an update about him
Tell me please
First reward
He says that "l can'nt come, but you can"
Where?
At his friend's home l know the address
Take me there please
But...
Khanum I will take care of her
May God bless you
Daughter...
Hi...
Sir
Take you sweets please
You kept remember my sweets
But why are you in so hurry.
.
Where are you going?
I can'nt tell you lie
Going to see Lord Sultan
That Pathan
Yes
He seems a pious person
Do you like him?
May God help you...
Go... go
My eyes are looking foryou
Hi...
Hi
He is my friend Ashraf...
And this.
Omrao
My friend has just one name on his tongue and that is Omrao
Madam this is my home
And I don't want to be in between both you...
Take care
Yourfriend is very interesting
Yes...
He knows that love tale is very long
And the time is very short
So he left
Two moments of love are greaterthan whole life
You talks as magically as your eyes
Where is Omrao?
...
Call hertoo
She is not here, has gone somewhere
Where?
To mee Lord Sultan at his friend's home
How did she dare to go?
Did'nt you stop her?
I tried my best to stop her...
But
Nothing is greaterthan love for her
Bismillah...
Try to learn the manners of singing by Khurshid
Who was she?
Omrao Jaan, "the famous dancer of Lucknow"
Raisaa...
You 've come back Omrao...
Where did you go?
To meet Lord Sultan at his friend's home
Without my permission
You know well that no one can enter or exit without my permission from this place
This is Khanum Jaan palace
Sultan is a self-esteem and wise person
Knows very well that he is to pay to Khanum Jaan for my time
This is the price
Do you consider it cruelty?
No... your bless is raining
Good and neverforget my this blessings...
Omrao Jaan
Of course...
Khanum...
What's matter Omrao?
Why Khanum is angry to you?
What I can tell?
I did a sin by meeting Lord Sultan
So finally you 've fallen in love
I think so
May God bless on us
We are love traders...
But
We 've no right to do love
But I am helpless
Therefore, I 've written these verses
Yes, please...
Tell me
To sacrifice life for someone was necessary
Life can'nt be spent without it
Excellent
We were deeply in love
Our wishes were completing
That we could'nt see anything except each other ljust started a good dream that
I 've written some verses
Please, tell
One cleverthief stolen my heart
While all guardes remained sleeping
Now...
Should I too yes
One cleverthief stolen my heart
I knew that you would say such
Lord... ..
Mr.ShujatLordhascome and would like to see you
Send him in...
What will happen now?
Hi...
You...
I think... are probably Omrao...
"a dancer, prostitute"
Yes lt would be great if would leave my son alone...
NOW I 've to talk to my son seperately
Take care
Dad...
You 've insulted Omrao by sending her out lt is just not her insult, but mine too
And I 've not liked this
OH...
So Omrao insult is your insult
And what's about your incompliance to my advices I advised you, not to meet Omrao again I love Omrao
Love...... .
Dear Son the love is that feeling
Which originates from a father's prayer and a mother's breastfeeding
The love, which is bought by money ls not a love, but a greed
Dad... ..
Please
Now you are blaiming our love morale and purity
Only God knows that how much our love is immaterial and pure
And you are not God
Sultan... ..
You are now crossing the limits
Don'nt forget that the money you are giving to her is not yours
But mine I can deprive you from all my wealth
No problem...
Go ahead
But I can'nt leave Omrao
Okay...
Fine
Then right now I deprive you from my wealth my life, home and every relation with me
You...
Why have you come...
is everything okay?
No...
It is not good...
His father reached there and was in much anger, wanted to talk to Sultan lonely
So what?
My heart is beating rapidly since then
You please go and inquire what happened
Me...?
Please... come back fast...
I am waiting
Alas...
Mr. Goha...
She is asking to inquire about your enemy
Omrao...
What is update?
Why don'nt you speak?
is there bad news?
Not so bad...
But not too good
Please tell
They argued a lot and his father deprived him from all his wealth, life,
and from home
But why?
Lord Sultan is in love with you
While his father does'nt even want to listen your name
Please leave me alone
Please come in...
Are you sure that your Lord Sultan will come
Dear Khanum this Lord Faiz Ali
Regards...
Please take a seat
Ladies first
May God bless you.
What is this?
Yes, I 've understand
But I 've listened that such arms are the cause of fame of some places
But belive me...
This gun is useless...
It can'nt fire
Okay...
Shut this topic and give me your wrist
Now tell which girl would you like?
Omrao Jaan
Omrao Jaan...
Would'nt you give me something to eat?
I am here because of Omrao Jaan's beauty
Dear Khanum please tell him I can'nt entertain him I am just for Lord Sultan
And I am very faithful to him
Have you heard now I excuse you for her as she is very loyal to him
Anyhow...
It is enough that I 've seen Omrao...
She is beautiful
Dear Faiz Ali we 've some more girls here
Such as Khurshid, Bismillah, Husna, Zeenat, etc.
You can chose any of them
No...
Unfortunatley, ljust love Omrao
And Omrao loves someone else
But I am not hopeless I will see her again if life is with me
Furthermore
This is the price of Omrao's one view and yourtime thanks

Lord Sultan
Sit nearto us l was informed that you came last night
And you were not feeling well
How are you feeling now?
I am fine now
But what was wrong?
Nothing special
We heard that you argued with yourfather
Dear Son...
It happens in every home
Don't worry...
But whatever I know all the wealth is in his custody
Which he spends as per his mood
But Khanum Madam
You please keep quiet I was telling him reality
Dear Lord we dancer run this palace just because of you lords
Otherwise, what we can do?
If we would love someone then how we will live without money
We 've just one relationship with others and that is because of money
You said correctly
Dear Khanum... please
You again interrupted me
Okay leave this topic...
See these beautiful cloaks lt would be great if you pay for one cloak for me its price is 5000
Now tell how I can arrange such huge money?
Hl... .
Dear Khanum
Faiz Ali...
Hi
Please come in
Khanum I am not able to pay for this cloak at the moment
And I feel no embarrassment by telling you that I 've nothing
This embrassement is for all Lords of Lucknow
Alas: my bad time that I am begging for just on cloak to you
Take this necklace...
Lord Sultan gave it to me
Buy the cloak against it
She is lying I didn't give it to her
Lord Sultan... you are our respectable guest
Live here as long as you wish
But if someone rebuke you forthis that such a rich Lord is underthe pity of a prostitute
Then I will crush him
Excuse me...
The matter is beyond limit now
Take it
And give cloak to dear Khanum
Okay Sir.
And I will buy one more
For Omrao Jaan
And if you both wish to buy...
Then I can pay forthose, too
I 've to leave now
But one thing I would like to say before leaving
That by comapring the love with money
You just not 've insulted me, but whole mankind
Oh...
It seems that you 're not habitual to heartruth
The truth is this, Dear Khanum
That I am Lord Sultan
And you are just a owner of this whore's house
Hey...
Listen...
Where are you going?
Please Stop... I will go with you, too
No...
Omrao I can'nt take you with me
You would 've to wait for me here they have insulted you I can't live with them for a moment
So, would you increase my tension?
My life is in the dark
Try to understand I can fight against whole world but can't go against fate
Its ourfate, i have to endeavor
And u have to wait
This wait will kill me
Good bye
What is this?
Get ready
Faiz Ali is waitting foryou downstair
But khanum I am for Lord Sultan
Forget him
Lord Sultan is a dream foryou
And whore is not for dreaming
But to let others dream
TO entertain the people
Lord Sultan is not dream but reality
And I love him
Love... ..
Thisluxeriouslife is due to money, but not by love
Ok
Lord Sultan will return and bring the money I don't know the future, talk about present
Lord Sultan is short of money and Faiz Ali full of money
Forget Lord Sultan, take the hand of Faiz Ali lt is in the interst of you and me
Don't cry, we all suffer
You and me
Aunt, you too
Here is your keep (Whore)
Keep
You are my heart's queen
Who has been sold that can't be queen
This can be decided by my heart
No one else
But nobody will listen my heart's decision why not?
I will listen and forever I will not give up to find the happiness ln which happiness you are in find, its dead body
And dead body is to burry
Not for love
For GOD sake, don't say like this, kill me
But don't kill my endeavor I must find my happiness
NO... .
Faiz Ali
You were right
Without heart you 're like a dead body
But I 've to get your love first
Or will permanenlty make you dead
Mr. Ashraf...

And finally we arrested you
We 're chasing you since last night
We 've arrested all your compansions

Therefore, I took you here
But it seems Lucknow people's are following you here too
Has my dad come?
No...
Dear not your dad, but Omrao
Omrao
But she is not alone
She has been arrested with complete team of Faiz Ali, great robber
And is in our custody
Faiz Ali, robber...
But He is a Lord
No dear...
He is a great robber
Whom we were seeking for long time I don't believe this
Dear son Sultan
Don't see the innocency of faces
Faces sometimes don't reflect exact picture
Can I see them?
Why not?
And He left the home to meet me lt seemed like my fate is coming to see me
Once again I was humilated... .
In life...
Before reaching to me...
He met to Faiz Ali first
Sultan...
Gari
Now I understand
Thanks for coming
Thanks for what
I am feeling pity foryou
Finally, I 've seen your real picture
Lord Faiz Ali...
A robber
Where are youg going, Sutlan Khan?
Mind your business
Means...
If you 're going to see Omrao Jaan
Then first take my permission
As she is my bought, Keep (whore)
What the hell you are talking?
As you left her she became mine
I am not interested to hear about her
You would be happy to hearthat she is with me on her will
She is a whore
And a whore's belives just in money
Just money
And you know a robber can'nt be short of money
You are lying
Ask her directly what is truth
I swear...
She has just my name on her lips
Faiz Ali
Don't you believe this?
Come here
If you don't belive this then please see her right leg
She has a big mole there
And I am sure that you, too, 've seen that mole
Omrao...
You would remain alive, but like a deadbody
Madam...
Lord Sultan wants to see you
Omrao Jaan is here, Sir
You people may go now
She is in our custody now
You...
Why have you drunk?
Now I am with you
I drank forthe first time because I left the whole world and came to you
But I 've drunk today because
I am leaving you today
Seperating
You 're kidding
Kidding can be with dearests
Not... ..
Withstrangers
So we are stranger now
Will you make someone else your wife?
I am going to marry Saba
When I came to know that you are in Gari I feared that something is going to happen, as it has
I ask you...
Where 're those promises, love, comittments
That ring, the symbol of our love
Why 're you throwing me out of your life?
What is my fault?
What I 've done wrong with you?
I 've the right to demand answer
You had the right
To that Omrao who was faithfull
But, Alas!
She died
As she became unfaithful to me for just money
What are you saying?
Do you remember one thing?
As long as you will be unfaithful
This Pathan will crush you
I 've just met your buyer, Faiz Ali, a robber
God knows that ljust asked for help from sjust to meet you
By selling your soul
By selling your body
This is not truth
He is misguiding you
Am I a fool?
He can define ups and downs of your body thoroughly
Even he knows about that mole
Hope you know...
Which mole I am talking about
Would you like to hear more
Speak
Give me answer
Oh... my luck
This is not truth
Believe me this is not truth
Please send him to Lucknow back with respect
I will not forget yourthis favor for my whole life
You let me dreamed to be out of that golden cage
And sending me back to that cage today again
As I am going out of your life
Would you give me anotherfavor?
As you 've ignored me today instead of my love ln such way in my love cry for once
Oh God...
How is that fire?
The crop has been cut so the fire is up to burn the remaining useless stuff
Khushid... .
Omrao
How were you Gohar?
I am fine now, as you 've come
How are you?
Thanks God
We 've heard everything
The facts about Faiz Ali and Sultan's dysloyality
I wish that you could 've learnt with my condition
The life teaches too much, Khurshid
The pain and it is fine with me
May I ask you one thing?
Did you remember us?
I did'nt forget you I swear...
We missed you a lot
Like two sisters argue at home, but if one is married, the other remains worry about her
Where is Khanum?
She is inside, not feeling well
Hey...
Omrao
Dear Khanum
You got back, daughter
How is your health?
I knew that you would must get back
You can'nt face the dreadful face of world
Did you see dreadful face of world
Khanum Dear I am not going to ask you, hence you need to tell anything
Honey...
This home is yours and you can live here for whole life
How are you feeling now?
Daughter has come back and so mother will be fine
Aunt... ..

Who has positioned wrongly this cart?
No my daughter

Your great teacher has been died
So you got back ln whom search you went to Gari...

That is great...
I think God want both of us to be married
What the hell your 're talking?
You 've drunk...
God knows that I don't 've such emotions foryou
Then have now
I am not so bad
What 're you doing, Gohar?
Come to your senses
Omrao Jaan, Do you know, What I 've done foryou?
I lost all my wealth foryou
Worked as you said and just waited for such moment
I was trying to recoverthat
That another storm knocked
A big storm
Which encircled the whole country
English soldiers attacked on Lucknow in search of rebels, too
That was a biggest mess of disaster
The rebels are uniting again in all over India
The British army has conquered Delhi
And they are moving towards up
They 've reached till Lucknow
Oh...
God save us and our Lucknow
God will bless us lt is very hard time
Yes, May God bless us
Where is this Gohar......
I 've not seen him for many days
Forget him...
Madam...
What happened...
Gohar
Blood...
How it happened?
I am not alone, Khanum...
All Lucknow is in blood
British army has sent big tanks to kill the rebels
Poeples are being hanged and children are tied on trees
Oh God... it is horrible
Hey...
Go and take medicine for him
Khanum...
Don't worry about me
No body is secure in Lucknow, now
These British poeple are killing just rebels or every Lucknow citizan
They think all the Lucknow as rebels
So I, too, 've decided to fight against them
Finally, you got sword in your hands I am proud of you
Don't waste more time now
You take all these from back door I am going to fight with them
Hey...
Let's move...
Pack the luggage
Dear Khanu, but where we would go?
Towards Nepal

Good bye
Take care yourselves all of you
May God bless you...
Good bye

But Why?
Where Khanum's palace...
The Khanum will be there lf the palace is destroyed, then me too

I want to tell you lots of things but I can't.
I am still confuse that what Title should be given to this Story.

Anyhow, what a amazing journey of life.
If you represent the Summary of this Story... in your Style then I will thankful to you.
My name is detective Brett Hopper, and this is the day that changes everything.
Freeze !
Put your hands up !
You're under arrest for the murder of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza.
I will be framed for murder...
Who the hell are you people ?
My girlfriend Rita will be in danger.
I know all this because I am living the same day... over and over again.
The day is the same, but different things happen.
Every morning, I get another chance.
For every decision, there's a consequence.
- I can save my sister Jennifer...
- You're acting really crazy.
- There isn't any time.
- What is this about ?
I can track down every lead.
Hopper, you should have received the package today.
The message on your answering machine came from the home of a U.S. attorney,
Nathan Baxter.
Anything else you're not telling me, partner ?
But today, I need some answers...
You called and left me a message about this package.
- Who told you to call me ?
- Garza.
Before it's too late.
If I can get here earlier tomorrow,
I might be able to help her.
Hopper, I need your help.
I've done something terrible.
I love you.
I love you, too.
When will I see you again ?
Tomorrow.
I'll see you tomorrow.
- Rita ?
- Hopper, I need your help.
I've done something terrible.
Andrea, tell me what happened.
It's Eddie...
I think I killed him.
All right, why don't you take me through it ?
He came over.
He was high.
He was tweaking so bad.
He got violent and...
I fought back.
And... he went over.
God, he's dead.
- This is my fault.
- No, no, it's not.
We both knew what Eddie was into.
- I didn't mean to kill him.
- Just stop it.
He brought this here.
You were defending yourself.
We're gonna fix this.
We'll leave him at his apartment.
There's a pay phone around the corner.
We can call 9-1-1 from there.
You okay ?
I know you've got problems of your own, Hopper.
I just didn't know where else to turn.
He was my partner, too.
When was the last time you talked to him ?
Couple months, maybe.
- You know if he was still using ?
- I don't know.
I mean, how long did we work with him before either of us realized, right ?
Eddie had his secrets.
I didn't feel a pulse, I swear to God.
- Hang in there, man.
- We gotta get him to a hospital.
St. Francis is the closest one, but it's the other way.
St. Francis.
Okay.
You're gonna be okay, man.
- Oh, no...
- I can lose him.
No, if we run, he'll have a bird on us in minutes.
- I don't think Eddie's got minutes.
- So we can't waste'em by going nascar against a black and white.
Just be cool.
All right, hang in there, man.
We're gonna get you some help.
Hang in.
Narcotics.
These are my partners.
We're on the job.
- What happened to him ?
- He was U.C. on a buy bust.
Took a hit from a couple of bangers.
We're trying to get him to the hospital
Let's go.
We've got an injured officer here.
6-l-14, I've got an injured officer at Alvarado and Glendale with his partners.
Show me escorting to St. Francis memorial hospital.
Code three.
Follow me.
You know I can't go in there.
I know.
I got this.
Need some help over here !
Come on, this side, this side.
Where's your other partner ?
Brett ?
- Hey.
- I didn't hear you get up.
I just...
I didn't want to wake you.
I like when you wake me.
Now you're all dressed, and I've missed all the good parts.
That's a good part, too.
Baby girl, I'm trying to get an early start.
But save me some of that for later, all right ?
Well, later it might be all gone.
Sweetie, it was...
it was just a joke.
No, I know.
I just...
I got a...
I got a lot on my mind.
You wanna tell me about it ?
It's Andrea.
I think she may be caught up in something with Eddie Reyes.
Eddie ?
I haven't heard his name since he got fired.
Well, he popped up yesterday.
So what exactly are those two caught up in ?
I don't know.
Trying to figure that out.
Eddie's had a rough time of it.
I hope he's not in any more trouble.
Please.
Eddie ain't nothing but trouble.
I gotta go.
I have to see this lady about a package.
- Lady ?
- It's evidence.
Might be important.
Hey, I know this is a little bit out of the blue.
You gotta stay away from Eddie today.
What the hell are you talking about ?
I think he's using again.
Listen, if he calls, don't pick up.
If he comes over, do not let him in.
- Where are you getting this ?
- Just trust me.
Stay away from Eddie today.
Okay ?
Okay, yeah, I got it.
Who was that ?
Hopper.
He says I should stay away from you.
Typical Hopper.
All I'm saying is, why today ?
The same day that you gotta go to I.A., he calls out of the blue to talk about me.
He's gotta know something.
Then why didn't he say something about us ?
He did.
He said to stay away from me.
You know how Hopper gets an idea in his head, he can't let it go.
You mean, like, how he got me canned ?
Come on.
You know that's not true.
Thought you were on my side.
I am.
Come on, baby.
I'm just worried about you, you know ?
You just said so yourself,
Hopper gets an idea in his head, he doesn't let it go.
He's going to I.A. today, too, and what if he knows what you've been doing ?
He doesn't.
Then why call this morning and tell you to stay away from me ?
Is there something you're not telling me ?
Like what ?
Come on, baby, of course not.
You've seen me at my worst, spun out.
There's nothing I can hide from you.
Hey, how about I take you to La Cabanita tonight ?
- You know you don't have to.
- I know.
I'd like to.
Even a rent-a-cop can afford that.
They played me some voice mail, a woman talking about some package they sent to you.
They think it has something to do with Garza.
You called and left me a message about this package.
- Ava, I'm Brett Hopper.
- How did you find me ?
Don't worry about that.
Where's Baxter ?
He's in the shower.
Now I know that you work for Garza.
I know that he had you send me a package.
- I need to know why.
- Garza never told me.
Why are you asking me, anyway ?
Why don't you just talk to him ?
Garza's dead.
He was killed last night.
My God.
When ?
I mean, why would anybody...
Right now I'm trying to figure all that out, but I think it may have something to do with that package you sent me.
Now please, I need you to tell me everything.
Garza was acting nervous.
When he brought me the packages, they were both sealed.
I didn't see what was inside.
He just said to send them.
- There were two packages ?
- You didn't know ?
Yeah, I sent one to you and one to someone... someone named...
Mathis.
Jennifer Mathis ?
You know her ?
She's my sister.
Put your clothes on and get the hell out of here.
You're in danger, too.
And stay away from Baxter.
Wait, so you never received a package ?
- No, I haven't gotten anything.
- You never got it.
- Your husband must have taken it.
- Randall ?
Look, just tell Randall I'm coming over to see him.
- Brett, that doesn't... he's not here.
- Where is he ?
He left work and went home.
We got a call.
Our alarm went off.
- What ?
- No, it's okay.
- It happens by mistake...
- Stay there.
I'm coming to get you.
I thought you were supposed to be at work.
I was worried about you, after your I.A. meeting, you know ?
With Hopper calling this morning and all.
So what did you tell'em ?
Slow down, slow down.
- They know what ?
- About Slim...
Everything, okay ?
They've got pictures and bank statements.
I don't know what I'm gonna do here, Eddie.
- They say anything about me ?
- This is my ass we're talking about.
Come on, don't be that way, baby.
- Hopper's the one who did this to us.
- This wasn't Hopper.
Okay ?
Hopper's wanted for murder.
- What ?
- They say he killed the A.D.A., Garza, and they want me to help bring him in.
Offered me a deal.
I roll on Hopper and they drop the case.
- What're you gonna do ?
- He's my partner.
What if he did it ?
Then you help bring down a murderer,
- and you walk away clean.
- And what if he didn't ?
Then you help prove his innocence, right ?
And everybody wins.
- Eddie, I can't...
- No, baby, no.
You take this deal, I.A. goes away.
Slim goes away.
I can try and clear my record.
I mean, this could be a second chance for both of us.
Look, I didn't roll on you, and I'm not gonna do it to Hopper.
Is there any time you don't side with that guy ?
They just told you he killed somebody, and yet you're still backing him.
What about us ?
Why are you looking at me like that ?
Are you using again ?
You think I'd do that to myself, to you, after everything you've done ?
- It's just a question.
- No...
No, that's a question that Hopper put there, right ?
That's what he told you this morning.
So he doesn't just get me fired, he gets to ruin us.
Probably just take his side on that one, too ?
Randall, it's me again.
Call me.
This isn't like him.
I'm gonna kill him.
- What ?
- Nothing.
Don't "nothing" me.
You pull me out of class, you drag me home and then you won't even tell me
- what the hell's going on.
- I would if I knew, but for now,
- you're safer with me.
- Safer ?
What are you talking about ?
Are we in some kind of danger ?
- Is Randall ?
- I don't know.
I can totally tell when you're lying...
I just wish you'd be a little bit more worried about yourself and a little less about your husband.
What is that supposed to mean ?
That's Randall's car.
Jen, wait...
let... hold...
Let me check out the house first.
Yeah.
Hopper, we need to talk.
Yeah, I'm a little busy right now, Andrea.
Look, you called me this morning, okay ?
I need your help.
Andrea, I gotta call you back.
The whole place is tossed.
Nobody's here.
Why would anybody do this to us ?
I think they're looking for that package.
Do you think they have Randall ?
- Forget Randall.
- What ?
For all we know, he could be involved in this.
What is wrong with you ?
My house is turned upside down, my husband is missing and all you can say is that maybe it's his fault ?
All I'm saying is that it's a possibility.
You never liked him.
You always assume the worst in people.
I'm following my instincts, all right ?
It's my job.
That's right, your instincts.
That's why I don't hear from you for a month.
That's why you missed your niece's birthday.
What are you talking about right now ?
Look, I'm sorry if I don't have time for the perfect family
- and the perfect life...
- It's not about being perfect.
It is about being there !
That's why your relationship with mom
- is so screwed up...
- What ?
My relationship... you keep turning her against me.
That's what's wrong with my relationship with ma !
It's never your fault.
You are just like dad.
You wanna play it like that ?
Where'd you get these bruises on your arm, Jennifer ?
Where'd you get those ?
- What ?
- What ?
Yeah, I know about'em.
You don't understand.
You don't.
Brett ?
Hopper !
- Randall, how did they find me ?
- I don't know, Brett !
- Did you tell'em ?
- No, I swear to god I didn't tell'em !
They took me, and then they were gonna get Jen, and they looked at that thing on the dash and they knew.
I think it's a G.P.S. or something.
Brett, what the hell are you doing ?
Where is the package ?
What did you do with it ?
I swear I don't know anything...
- I don't believe you !
- Stop it !
Let him go !
I'm going to count to three, you hear me ?
One... two...
- Brett, please don't...
- I have it !
I hid it, okay ?
I was scared.
I got a call.
They said, "don't tell anyone," and I opened it and I saw that.
- Do you know who this woman is ?
- No.
I thought it was some kind of threat, so I hid it.
I didn't even tell Randall.
Jen, I'm a cop.
This is what I deal with.
I can protect you.
- Why didn't you ask me for help ?
- I tried.
- When ?
- Last night.
I called you six times.
And I called you back.
You said something was wrong with your phone.
What are you talking about ?
You never called me back.
The cops are coming.
Get the hell off my property.
I'm closing my tabs.
Anything else ?
No, thanks.
Tough shift, huh ?
Just be glad your day's not as bad as mine.
... in baseball, the Dodgers have once again defied expectation, coming back from the dead with a 7-run rally in the bottom of the 9th to beat the Giants 11-10.
I knew it.
I told you this would happen.
But nobody believed me.
Didn't I say this would happen ?
I shoulda put money on that bitch.
Hey, man, how did you know they'd win ?
Because the Dodgers rule.
Right.
Yeah.
- Go, blue.
- Go, blue.
Yes, this is detective Spivak.
I'm looking into an old case.
The D.R. Number is 91-1183944641.
Okay, well could you transfer me then, please ?
So someone checked out the murder book.
I need to know who.
What did you say ?
Internal Affairs pulled a murder book.
I need to know the name of the requester.
Well then, what time do they open ?
Hello ?
Hello ?
- Hello ?
- Hey, it's me.
- Thank god.
Are you okay ?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Brett, you know what they're saying.
They brought me in, they asked me questions, told me terrible things.
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry they put you through all that.
- You know none of it's true.
- I didn't believe it.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Now, I have to ask you a favor.
Honey, I need to speak to Chad.
Now I don't have time to explain.
I know he's there.
That's fine.
I just need to speak to him, because it's very, very important.
It's for you.
It's Brett.
- Hey, partner.
- Internal Affairs pulled a murder book for a case from 1991.
I need you to tell me who.
Classic Hopper, target of a citywide manhunt, but it's still
"I need, I need, I need."
I'm trying to prove my innocence here.
Great.
Come on into the station, we'll talk all about it.
Why don't you come get me ?
I'm at the corner of...
Andrea, please tell me that you did not see Eddie today.
Hello ?
You turned her against me.
- Eddie ?
- You did it, Hopper.
- Remember that.
- Eddie, what are you doing ?
Put it down !
Andrea.
I like when you wake me.
Now you're all dressed, and I've already missed all the good parts.
That's a good part, too.
Do you remember Eddie Reyes ?
Of course I do.
Are you still feeling bad about how that went down ?
No, no, it's Andrea.
I feel like she may be getting caught up in something with him.
Like what ?
I don't know.
It might have to do with the I.A. Investigations, though.
Whatever it is, it's not gonna end well.
How could you possibly know that ?
Because I've seen it happen before.
Yeah, but the difference is you.
You've seen this kind of thing happen before, so why don't you help her ?
Don't let it happen.
It might not be that simple.
Well, then at least you tried.
Be safe today, okay ?
You too.
That thing on the dash.
I think it's a G.P.S. Or something.
- Hopper, what are you doing here ?
- I need to talk to you.
I know this is coming out of nowhere, but... you gotta stay away from Eddie today.
- What ?
- Yeah, he's using again, so if you see him it'll just...
it'll end bad for the both of you.
Where is he ?
- What are...
- Where is he ?
Hey, Hopper.
You got a lot of cojones, coming her saying that crap about me.
You lied to me.
You've been all business with me for the last six months.
All of a sudden we're best friends, confiding secrets in each other ?
I never hid anything from you.
Oh, like the fact you've been looking into the latin disciples ?
Thought I didn't know ?
How is what we do together any of your business ?
- You stay out of this.
- No, no, no.
You lost the right to tell me what to do when you called in that drug test to get me fired.
- That's not what happened, Eddie.
- You expect me to believe
- that you didn't even know about it ?
- You weren't doing your job.
That's right.
You just had to protect your reputation.
And now you're gonna screw Andrea the way you screwed me.
You're on your own.
- This is Chad Shelton.
- Chad, it's Hopper.
Hopper, didn't expect to hear from you so early.
- The meeting's at 3 :00.
- Yeah, I actually had a question for you.
I've got some questions for you, too.
I was gonna wait to ask them in person.
So, then, uh, we're still on ?
Oh, I'm sure we're both looking forward to spending this quality time together.
- So why are you calling me ?
- I'm looking into this... homicide from 1991.
Now the records say that Internal Affairs pulled the murder book.
Do you have any idea who ?
I can't wait to help you out with that, buddy.
Can I get you anything else ?
Maybe walk your dog for you ?
Wash your car ?
Maybe you wanna sleep with my ex-wife ?
Oh, wait...
Punk.
Tough day ?
Yeah.
Things'll look up.
What can I bring you ?
Just, uh, some coffee, please.
Okay.
Yes, this is detective Spivak calling from Homicide.
I'm looking for records.
Yes, I will hold.
Well, I know Internal Affairs has it.
I'm trying to figure out who.
Can I please speak to your lieutenant ?
I need to talk to your captain.
This is the Los Angeles police department.
Your call is important to us.
Your estimated wait time is 15 minutes.
Let me ask you something, woman.
This look like white wine to you ?
Oh, now I know you didn't just do that !
Now bring me what I ordered.
Yeah.
Detective Hopper,
I understand you've been making some calls.
- Who is this ?
- It's not going to be that easy.
You're going to admit to killing Alberto Garza.
Well, you're calling me, who ever you are, so you must want something.
I'll get right to the point.
You do have something I'm looking for.
The packages.
Very good, detective Hopper.
Okay, you want the packages.
I want some answers.
You bring what you have to Elysian park.
There are some picnic tables.
The one on the North end at 2 :00 p. m... and I will bring you all the answers you need.
Okay, if I get there, and it looks like a trap, I'm gone.
Detective Hopper, you act as though you have a choice.
Andrea, I cannot do tthis now, okay ?
I tried to help you early this morning.
You're on your own now.
Please, Hopper.
Andrea ?
I need your help.
It's Eddie.
I made a terrible mistake.
What happened with Eddie ?
I can't go to the police because of I.A., and Eddie... look, I need you right now.
And no one else can help me.
If we don't find him, he's dead.
Please, Hopper.
I can't do this alone.
You bring what you have to Elysian park... and I will bring you all the answers you need.
You don't always get to choose who you fall in love with, though, right ?
I mean, I knew Eddie had been using, but I thought that was behind us.
I helped him get clean.
He was better.
I didn't think it was gonna be like that again.
What happened ?
You did... this morning.
After you left, he got so mad.
He started throwing things.
He ran off... and then he found me here at the market later.
I've seen him like this before, and I know he's gonna do something stupid.
He had his old. 38, and I know he's gonna score.
Where does he go to score ?
Danny Yan.
Slim ?
Your C.I. ?
Yeah.
What exactly is Eddie mixed up in ?
There's a lot more bounce than bouncer for club like this.
Something's wrong.
None of Slim's guys are on the floor.
Get everyone out there.
He doesn't leave this neighborhood.
Battle.
I should've known.
Where's Eddie ?
- We had a little disagreement.
- What did you do ?
Tell me something, babe.
How does a pathetic tweaker like Eddie score such a sweet slice of pie like you ?
Yeah, keep talking, slim.
I will shoot your ass.
Hey...
I'm a victim here.
I just got assaulted in my place of business by your boyfriend, which, by the way, doubles your juice.
Shut up.
Hopper doesn't know about our little arrangement, right ?
You want to arrest somebody, detective, try our star-crossed lovers here.
One of them's got a nasty habit he can't keep up with, and the other one, well... can you put somebody away for being an enabler ?
Ah, ah, don't, don't.
See, when Eddie was on the job, he got used to taking home free samples, but ex-cops don't get glass for free, so Charlie's angel here kept bailing him out.
Straight out of Shakespeare, man.
So sad.
Did you wake up this morning and decide you wanted a bullet in your head ?
Because the day I'm having, you do not wanna get on my bad side.
- All I'm saying...
- Where's Eddie ?
!
Somewhere on foot between the 110 and the cornfields.
Chinatown ain't that big, man.
You better hope you find him before we do.
Yeah, you better hope we do, too.
You were paying off that dirtbag ?
That's what I.A.'S got on you ?
- It's not that simple.
- Yeah, it is.
You were giving money to a drug dealer.
They we gonna kill Eddie, okay ?
I couldn't report it.
I didn't have a choice.
Do you have any idea what I gave up to help you ?
My family, Rita, their lives are in danger because I'm being framed for murder, and today I had a chance to find the guy behind it, maybe even stop it, but I didn't.
I helped you instead.
- I'm sorry, Hopper.
- "Sorry" ?
"Sorry" doesn't keep me out of jail, or Rita from getting killed.
"Sorry" doesn't end is damn day.
"Sorry".
Every morning...
I wake up and I think, maybe today'll be different,
but it always ends the same.
He's 30 days clean, and I'm back in Slim's parking lot, hoping to God I find Eddie alive.
But I can't give up, because what if today it is different ?
Maybe today he kicks it, or he dies.
If it were someone you loved, wouldn't you do everything that you could to save them ?
I know where Eddie's gonna be.
- He's gonna show up near here.
- How do you know that ?
Trust me, just keep looking.
- I'll take the inside, you take the street ?
- Yeah.
- Your keys.
- Eddie.
- Give me your keys.
- Put down the gun.
Now.
Now.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Hey.
- Keys now.
- Eddie.
- Shut up !
- Hey, Eddie.
This isn't you.
Eddie, don't do this.
Don't do this.
You never got it, did you ?
I mean, you just... you didn't even try to understand.
- Please, Eddie, you don't have to...
- I'm talking here, baby.
All right, what didn't I understand ?
I got seven years on you, and you still made d-2 before I did.
You know, I mean, not everybody's a super cop.
I just wanted a little relief.
Okay, okay, I get that.
I get that.
But your beef is with me, no Andrea, so let her go, man.
- Just put down your gun.
- You know I can't do that.
Eddie, come on, it doesn't have to go down like this.
You know that... that cholo that I caught up in Boyle Heights ?
You know, that low-level dealer ?
What ?
- I patted him down...
- Eddie, stay with me
- Why don't you just listen ?
- All right.
In... booking,
I find out that he's got a little 5-shot just jammed in his belt, and he coulda popped us at any time,
and I didn't catch it'cause I was tweaking.
So I look at this guy, and I say, "you know, why...
why didn't you shoot me ?"
And he... he just looks at me and he said, "because you seem like a nice guy."
I should be dead, and you should be dead.
We... all of us should be dead because of me.
- It's over, man.
- No, it's not over.
Eddie, listen, we can all walk out of here together.
- Whoa, hey, hey, hey !
- Eddie, no !
I didn't make the call, Eddie.
You hear me ?
I didn't make the call.
All right ?
But I didn't warn you, either.
Now I'd heard that the drug test was coming down, and I knew you were using, but what's on me is that I coulda helped you, and I didn't, and now I'm asking... all right ?
There.
I'm asking you now, please,
let me help you now.
- No.
- Eddie ?
Let me help you.
Let me help you this time.
Okay.
I got you.
- Okay.
- Sorry.
All right.
all right.
I'm so sorry.
- Morning.
- Hey, good morning.
I didn't hear you get up.
- I didn't want to wake you.
- I like when you wake me.
Is everything okay ?
The phone is ringing.
Yeah, that's that's what it does.
- This hasn't happened before.
- What, someone calling you ?
- Are you kidding ?
- No, it's not that.
Something's changed.
- Andrea.
- Hey, Hopper.
So... this might sound a little out of the blue, but...
I'm taking Eddie to rehab this morning.
There's a lot to tell you.
You still there ?
You didn't have to come.
I can do this without you.
Yeah, well, I just wanted to see for myself.
You know, you threw a lot at me on the phone.
Sorry.
It's just... when I woke up today, I felt...
I felt different.
Different ?
Like...
like how ?
Like I had this weird urge to call you, and then all this stuff came out, and... it's strange.
I've been feeling so hopeless, but today, I don't know.
So it... it's good ?
Yeah, and even with this I.A. Stuff, I mean,
I woke up with the strangest idea.
Why don't I just tell Chad the truth ?
I'd like to think that, uh, you know, he wouldn't crucify you, but...
Yeah, I've already called my league rep and told him that's what I'm gonna do, so...
If I get days, I get days.
And... if I loose my job... at least I'm not dead.
What ?
Why... why does that make you laugh ?
No, it's... this just isn't the day that I expected to have.
Yeah, me neither... but here we are.
What about Eddie ?
Well, I don't think he's happy to be pushed out of the nest.
I don't think it's gonna be easy either way.
What are you looking at ?
- My old partner.
- Don't look so smug.
I'll break my foot off in your ass, cabron.
So you got any gas in this piece of crap, or what ?
What, is this this some kind of joke ?
What are you talking about ?
Like I'm supposed to see this, and it'll remind me of what kind of cop I used to be or some garbage like that ?
What's supposed to remind you of that ?
This stupid picture that you dug up.
- You knew about that picture ?
- Yeah, I should.
- I was the first officer on scene.
- What ?
Jane Doe.
Body dumped in a car off Figueroa.
I was a rookie.
I didn't know much.
That's when I first met your old man.
He was okay.
My father was there ?
Yeah, he was the lead detective on it.
But he didn't close it.
Evidence went missing, and it just all fell apart.
It's funny how they always hinge on some little, stupid thing.
My name is detective Brett Hopper, and this is the day that changes everything.
Freeze !
Put your hands up !
You're under arrest for the murder of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza.
I will be framed for murder...
Who the hell are you people ?
My girlfriend Rita will be in danger.
I know all this because I am living the same day... over and over again.
The day is the same, but different things happen.
Every morning, I get another chance.
For every decision, there's a consequence.
- I can save my sister Jennifer...
- You're acting really crazy.
- There isn't any time.
- What is this about ?
I can track down every lead.
Hopper, you should have received the package today.
The message on your answering machine came from the home of a U.S. attorney,
Nathan Baxter.
Anything else you're not telling me, partner ?
But today, I need some answers...
You called and left me a message about this package.
- Who told you to call me ?
- Garza.
Before it's too late.
If I can get here earlier tomorrow,
I might be able to help her.
Hopper, I need your help.
I've done something terrible.
I love you.
I love you, too.
When will I see you again ?
Tomorrow.
I'll see you tomorrow.
- Rita ?
- Hopper, I need your help.
I've done something terrible.
Andrea, tell me what happened.
It's Eddie...
I think I killed him.
All right, why don't you take me through it ?
He came over.
He was high.
He was tweaking so bad.
He got violent and...
I fought back.
And... he went over.
God, he's dead.
- This is my fault.
- No, no, it's not.
We both knew what Eddie was into.
- I didn't mean to kill him.
- Just stop it.
He brought this here.
You were defending yourself.
We're gonna fix this.
We'll leave him at his apartment.
There's a pay phone around the corner.
We can call 9-1-1 from there.
You okay ?
I know you've got problems of your own, Hopper.
I just didn't know where else to turn.
He was my partner, too.
When was the last time you talked to him ?
Couple months, maybe.
- You know if he was still using ?
- I don't know.
I mean, how long did we work with him before either of us realized, right ?
Eddie had his secrets.
I didn't feel a pulse, I swear to God.
- Hang in there, man.
- We gotta get him to a hospital.
St. Francis is the closest one, but it's the other way.
St. Francis.
Okay.
You're gonna be okay, man.
- Oh, no...
- I can lose him.
No, if we run, he'll have a bird on us in minutes.
- I don't think Eddie's got minutes.
- So we can't waste'em by going nascar against a black and white.
Just be cool.
All right, hang in there, man.
We're gonna get you some help.
Hang in.
Narcotics.
These are my partners.
We're on the job.
- What happened to him ?
- He was U.C. on a buy bust.
Took a hit from a couple of bangers.
We're trying to get him to the hospital
Let's go.
We've got an injured officer here.
6-l-14, I've got an injured officer at Alvarado and Glendale with his partners.
Show me escorting to St. Francis memorial hospital.
Code three.
Follow me.
You know I can't go in there.
I know.
I got this.
Need some help over here !
Come on, this side, this side.
Where's your other partner ?
Brett ?
- Hey.
- I didn't hear you get up.
I just...
I didn't want to wake you.
I like when you wake me.
Now you're all dressed, and I've missed all the good parts.
That's a good part, too.
Baby girl, I'm trying to get an early start.
But save me some of that for later, all right ?
Well, later it might be all gone.
Sweetie, it was...
it was just a joke.
No, I know.
I just...
I got a...
I got a lot on my mind.
You wanna tell me about it ?
It's Andrea.
I think she may be caught up in something with Eddie Reyes.
Eddie ?
I haven't heard his name since he got fired.
Well, he popped up yesterday.
So what exactly are those two caught up in ?
I don't know.
Trying to figure that out.
Eddie's had a rough time of it.
I hope he's not in any more trouble.
Please.
Eddie ain't nothing but trouble.
I gotta go.
I have to see this lady about a package.
- Lady ?
- It's evidence.
Might be important.
Hey, I know this is a little bit out of the blue.
You gotta stay away from Eddie today.
What the hell are you talking about ?
I think he's using again.
Listen, if he calls, don't pick up.
If he comes over, do not let him in.
- Where are you getting this ?
- Just trust me.
Stay away from Eddie today.
Okay ?
Okay, yeah, I got it.
Who was that ?
Hopper.
He says I should stay away from you.
Typical Hopper.
All I'm saying is, why today ?
The same day that you gotta go to I.A., he calls out of the blue to talk about me.
He's gotta know something.
Then why didn't he say something about us ?
He did.
He said to stay away from me.
You know how Hopper gets an idea in his head, he can't let it go.
You mean, like, how he got me canned ?
Come on.
You know that's not true.
Thought you were on my side.
I am.
Come on, baby.
I'm just worried about you, you know ?
You just said so yourself,
Hopper gets an idea in his head, he doesn't let it go.
He's going to I.A. today, too, and what if he knows what you've been doing ?
He doesn't.
Then why call this morning and tell you to stay away from me ?
Is there something you're not telling me ?
Like what ?
Come on, baby, of course not.
You've seen me at my worst, spun out.
There's nothing I can hide from you.
Hey, how about I take you to La Cabanita tonight ?
- You know you don't have to.
- I know.
I'd like to.
Even a rent-a-cop can afford that.
They played me some voice mail, a woman talking about some package they sent to you.
They think it has something to do with Garza.
You called and left me a message about this package.
- Ava, I'm Brett Hopper.
- How did you find me ?
Don't worry about that.
Where's Baxter ?
He's in the shower.
Now I know that you work for Garza.
I know that he had you send me a package.
- I need to know why.
- Garza never told me.
Why are you asking me, anyway ?
Why don't you just talk to him ?
Garza's dead.
He was killed last night.
My God.
When ?
I mean, why would anybody...
Right now I'm trying to figure all that out, but I think it may have something to do with that package you sent me.
Now please, I need you to tell me everything.
Garza was acting nervous.
When he brought me the packages, they were both sealed.
I didn't see what was inside.
He just said to send them.
- There were two packages ?
- You didn't know ?
Yeah, I sent one to you and one to someone... someone named...
Mathis.
Jennifer Mathis ?
You know her ?
She's my sister.
Put your clothes on and get the hell out of here.
You're in danger, too.
And stay away from Baxter.
Wait, so you never received a package ?
- No, I haven't gotten anything.
- You never got it.
- Your husband must have taken it.
- Randall ?
Look, just tell Randall I'm coming over to see him.
- Brett, that doesn't... he's not here.
- Where is he ?
He left work and went home.
We got a call.
Our alarm went off.
- What ?
- No, it's okay.
- It happens by mistake...
- Stay there.
I'm coming to get you.
I thought you were supposed to be at work.
I was worried about you, after your I.A. meeting, you know ?
With Hopper calling this morning and all.
So what did you tell'em ?
Slow down, slow down.
- They know what ?
- About Slim...
Everything, okay ?
They've got pictures and bank statements.
I don't know what I'm gonna do here, Eddie.
- They say anything about me ?
- This is my ass we're talking about.
Come on, don't be that way, baby.
- Hopper's the one who did this to us.
- This wasn't Hopper.
Okay ?
Hopper's wanted for murder.
- What ?
- They say he killed the A.D.A., Garza, and they want me to help bring him in.
Offered me a deal.
I roll on Hopper and they drop the case.
- What're you gonna do ?
- He's my partner.
What if he did it ?
Then you help bring down a murderer,
- and you walk away clean.
- And what if he didn't ?
Then you help prove his innocence, right ?
And everybody wins.
- Eddie, I can't...
- No, baby, no.
You take this deal, I.A. goes away.
Slim goes away.
I can try and clear my record.
I mean, this could be a second chance for both of us.
Look, I didn't roll on you, and I'm not gonna do it to Hopper.
Is there any time you don't side with that guy ?
They just told you he killed somebody, and yet you're still backing him.
What about us ?
Why are you looking at me like that ?
Are you using again ?
You think I'd do that to myself, to you, after everything you've done ?
- It's just a question.
- No...
No, that's a question that Hopper put there, right ?
That's what he told you this morning.
So he doesn't just get me fired, he gets to ruin us.
Probably just take his side on that one, too ?
Randall, it's me again.
Call me.
This isn't like him.
I'm gonna kill him.
- What ?
- Nothing.
Don't "nothing" me.
You pull me out of class, you drag me home and then you won't even tell me
- what the hell's going on.
- I would if I knew, but for now,
- you're safer with me.
- Safer ?
What are you talking about ?
Are we in some kind of danger ?
- Is Randall ?
- I don't know.
I can totally tell when you're lying...
I just wish you'd be a little bit more worried about yourself and a little less about your husband.
What is that supposed to mean ?
That's Randall's car.
Jen, wait...
let... hold...
Let me check out the house first.
Yeah.
Hopper, we need to talk.
Yeah, I'm a little busy right now, Andrea.
Look, you called me this morning, okay ?
I need your help.
Andrea, I gotta call you back.
The whole place is tossed.
Nobody's here.
Why would anybody do this to us ?
I think they're looking for that package.
Do you think they have Randall ?
- Forget Randall.
- What ?
For all we know, he could be involved in this.
What is wrong with you ?
My house is turned upside down, my husband is missing and all you can say is that maybe it's his fault ?
All I'm saying is that it's a possibility.
You never liked him.
You always assume the worst in people.
I'm following my instincts, all right ?
It's my job.
That's right, your instincts.
That's why I don't hear from you for a month.
That's why you missed your niece's birthday.
What are you talking about right now ?
Look, I'm sorry if I don't have time for the perfect family
- and the perfect life...
- It's not about being perfect.
It is about being there !
That's why your relationship with mom
- is so screwed up...
- What ?
My relationship... you keep turning her against me.
That's what's wrong with my relationship with ma !
It's never your fault.
You are just like dad.
You wanna play it like that ?
Where'd you get these bruises on your arm, Jennifer ?
Where'd you get those ?
- What ?
- What ?
Yeah, I know about'em.
You don't understand.
You don't.
Brett ?
Hopper !
- Randall, how did they find me ?
- I don't know, Brett !
- Did you tell'em ?
- No, I swear to god I didn't tell'em !
They took me, and then they were gonna get Jen, and they looked at that thing on the dash and they knew.
I think it's a G.P.S. or something.
Brett, what the hell are you doing ?
Where is the package ?
What did you do with it ?
I swear I don't know anything...
- I don't believe you !
- Stop it !
Let him go !
I'm going to count to three, you hear me ?
One... two...
- Brett, please don't...
- I have it !
I hid it, okay ?
I was scared.
I got a call.
They said, "don't tell anyone," and I opened it and I saw that.
- Do you know who this woman is ?
- No.
I thought it was some kind of threat, so I hid it.
I didn't even tell Randall.
Jen, I'm a cop.
This is what I deal with.
I can protect you.
- Why didn't you ask me for help ?
- I tried.
- When ?
- Last night.
I called you six times.
And I called you back.
You said something was wrong with your phone.
What are you talking about ?
You never called me back.
The cops are coming.
Get the hell off my property.
I'm closing my tabs.
Anything else ?
No, thanks.
Tough shift, huh ?
Just be glad your day's not as bad as mine.
... in baseball, the Dodgers have once again defied expectation, coming back from the dead with a 7-run rally in the bottom of the 9th to beat the Giants 11-10.
I knew it.
I told you this would happen.
But nobody believed me.
Didn't I say this would happen ?
I shoulda put money on that bitch.
Hey, man, how did you know they'd win ?
Because the Dodgers rule.
Right.
Yeah.
- Go, blue.
- Go, blue.
Yes, this is detective Spivak.
I'm looking into an old case.
The D.R. Number is 91-1183944641.
Okay, well could you transfer me then, please ?
So someone checked out the murder book.
I need to know who.
What did you say ?
Internal Affairs pulled a murder book.
I need to know the name of the requester.
Well then, what time do they open ?
Hello ?
Hello ?
- Hello ?
- Hey, it's me.
- Thank god.
Are you okay ?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Brett, you know what they're saying.
They brought me in, they asked me questions, told me terrible things.
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry they put you through all that.
- You know none of it's true.
- I didn't believe it.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Now, I have to ask you a favor.
Honey, I need to speak to Chad.
Now I don't have time to explain.
I know he's there.
That's fine.
I just need to speak to him, because it's very, very important.
It's for you.
It's Brett.
- Hey, partner.
- Internal Affairs pulled a murder book for a case from 1991.
I need you to tell me who.
Classic Hopper, target of a citywide manhunt, but it's still
"I need, I need, I need."
I'm trying to prove my innocence here.
Great.
Come on into the station, we'll talk all about it.
Why don't you come get me ?
I'm at the corner of...
Andrea, please tell me that you did not see Eddie today.
Hello ?
You turned her against me.
- Eddie ?
- You did it, Hopper.
- Remember that.
- Eddie, what are you doing ?
Put it down !
Andrea.
I like when you wake me.
Now you're all dressed, and I've already missed all the good parts.
That's a good part, too.
Do you remember Eddie Reyes ?
Of course I do.
Are you still feeling bad about how that went down ?
No, no, it's Andrea.
I feel like she may be getting caught up in something with him.
Like what ?
I don't know.
It might have to do with the I.A. Investigations, though.
Whatever it is, it's not gonna end well.
How could you possibly know that ?
Because I've seen it happen before.
Yeah, but the difference is you.
You've seen this kind of thing happen before, so why don't you help her ?
Don't let it happen.
It might not be that simple.
Well, then at least you tried.
Be safe today, okay ?
You too.
That thing on the dash.
I think it's a G.P.S. Or something.
- Hopper, what are you doing here ?
- I need to talk to you.
I know this is coming out of nowhere, but... you gotta stay away from Eddie today.
- What ?
- Yeah, he's using again, so if you see him it'll just...
it'll end bad for the both of you.
Where is he ?
- What are...
- Where is he ?
Hey, Hopper.
You got a lot of cojones, coming her saying that crap about me.
You lied to me.
You've been all business with me for the last six months.
All of a sudden we're best friends, confiding secrets in each other ?
I never hid anything from you.
Oh, like the fact you've been looking into the latin disciples ?
Thought I didn't know ?
How is what we do together any of your business ?
- You stay out of this.
- No, no, no.
You lost the right to tell me what to do when you called in that drug test to get me fired.
- That's not what happened, Eddie.
- You expect me to believe
- that you didn't even know about it ?
- You weren't doing your job.
That's right.
You just had to protect your reputation.
And now you're gonna screw Andrea the way you screwed me.
You're on your own.
- This is Chad Shelton.
- Chad, it's Hopper.
Hopper, didn't expect to hear from you so early.
- The meeting's at 3 :00.
- Yeah, I actually had a question for you.
I've got some questions for you, too.
I was gonna wait to ask them in person.
So, then, uh, we're still on ?
Oh, I'm sure we're both looking forward to spending this quality time together.
- So why are you calling me ?
- I'm looking into this... homicide from 1991.
Now the records say that Internal Affairs pulled the murder book.
Do you have any idea who ?
I can't wait to help you out with that, buddy.
Can I get you anything else ?
Maybe walk your dog for you ?
Wash your car ?
Maybe you wanna sleep with my ex-wife ?
Oh, wait...
Punk.
Tough day ?
Yeah.
Things'll look up.
What can I bring you ?
Just, uh, some coffee, please.
Okay.
Yes, this is detective Spivak calling from Homicide.
I'm looking for records.
Yes, I will hold.
Well, I know Internal Affairs has it.
I'm trying to figure out who.
Can I please speak to your lieutenant ?
I need to talk to your captain.
This is the Los Angeles police department.
Your call is important to us.
Your estimated wait time is 15 minutes.
Let me ask you something, woman.
This look like white wine to you ?
Oh, now I know you didn't just do that !
Now bring me what I ordered.
Yeah.
Detective Hopper,
I understand you've been making some calls.
- Who is this ?
- It's not going to be that easy.
You're going to admit to killing Alberto Garza.
Well, you're calling me, who ever you are, so you must want something.
I'll get right to the point.
You do have something I'm looking for.
The packages.
Very good, detective Hopper.
Okay, you want the packages.
I want some answers.
You bring what you have to Elysian park.
There are some picnic tables.
The one on the North end at 2 :00 p. m... and I will bring you all the answers you need.
Okay, if I get there, and it looks like a trap, I'm gone.
Detective Hopper, you act as though you have a choice.
Andrea, I cannot do tthis now, okay ?
I tried to help you early this morning.
You're on your own now.
Please, Hopper.
Andrea ?
I need your help.
It's Eddie.
I made a terrible mistake.
What happened with Eddie ?
I can't go to the police because of I.A., and Eddie... look, I need you right now.
And no one else can help me.
If we don't find him, he's dead.
Please, Hopper.
I can't do this alone.
You bring what you have to Elysian park... and I will bring you all the answers you need.
You don't always get to choose who you fall in love with, though, right ?
I mean, I knew Eddie had been using, but I thought that was behind us.
I helped him get clean.
He was better.
I didn't think it was gonna be like that again.
What happened ?
You did... this morning.
After you left, he got so mad.
He started throwing things.
He ran off... and then he found me here at the market later.
I've seen him like this before, and I know he's gonna do something stupid.
He had his old. 38, and I know he's gonna score.
Where does he go to score ?
Danny Yan.
Slim ?
Your C.I. ?
Yeah.
What exactly is Eddie mixed up in ?
There's a lot more bounce than bouncer for club like this.
Something's wrong.
None of Slim's guys are on the floor.
Get everyone out there.
He doesn't leave this neighborhood.
Battle.
I should've known.
Where's Eddie ?
- We had a little disagreement.
- What did you do ?
Tell me something, babe.
How does a pathetic tweaker like Eddie score such a sweet slice of pie like you ?
Yeah, keep talking, slim.
I will shoot your ass.
Hey...
I'm a victim here.
I just got assaulted in my place of business by your boyfriend, which, by the way, doubles your juice.
Shut up.
Hopper doesn't know about our little arrangement, right ?
You want to arrest somebody, detective, try our star-crossed lovers here.
One of them's got a nasty habit he can't keep up with, and the other one, well... can you put somebody away for being an enabler ?
Ah, ah, don't, don't.
See, when Eddie was on the job, he got used to taking home free samples, but ex-cops don't get glass for free, so Charlie's angel here kept bailing him out.
Straight out of Shakespeare, man.
So sad.
Did you wake up this morning and decide you wanted a bullet in your head ?
Because the day I'm having, you do not wanna get on my bad side.
- All I'm saying...
- Where's Eddie ?
!
Somewhere on foot between the 110 and the cornfields.
Chinatown ain't that big, man.
You better hope you find him before we do.
Yeah, you better hope we do, too.
You were paying off that dirtbag ?
That's what I.A.'S got on you ?
- It's not that simple.
- Yeah, it is.
You were giving money to a drug dealer.
They we gonna kill Eddie, okay ?
I couldn't report it.
I didn't have a choice.
Do you have any idea what I gave up to help you ?
My family, Rita, their lives are in danger because I'm being framed for murder, and today I had a chance to find the guy behind it, maybe even stop it, but I didn't.
I helped you instead.
- I'm sorry, Hopper.
- "Sorry" ?
"Sorry" doesn't keep me out of jail, or Rita from getting killed.
"Sorry" doesn't end is damn day.
"Sorry".
Every morning...
I wake up and I think, maybe today'll be different,
but it always ends the same.
He's 30 days clean, and I'm back in Slim's parking lot, hoping to God I find Eddie alive.
But I can't give up, because what if today it is different ?
Maybe today he kicks it, or he dies.
If it were someone you loved, wouldn't you do everything that you could to save them ?
I know where Eddie's gonna be.
- He's gonna show up near here.
- How do you know that ?
Trust me, just keep looking.
- I'll take the inside, you take the street ?
- Yeah.
- Your keys.
- Eddie.
- Give me your keys.
- Put down the gun.
Now.
Now.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Hey.
- Keys now.
- Eddie.
- Shut up !
- Hey, Eddie.
This isn't you.
Eddie, don't do this.
Don't do this.
You never got it, did you ?
I mean, you just... you didn't even try to understand.
- Please, Eddie, you don't have to...
- I'm talking here, baby.
All right, what didn't I understand ?
I got seven years on you, and you still made d-2 before I did.
You know, I mean, not everybody's a super cop.
I just wanted a little relief.
Okay, okay, I get that.
I get that.
But your beef is with me, no Andrea, so let her go, man.
- Just put down your gun.
- You know I can't do that.
Eddie, come on, it doesn't have to go down like this.
You know that... that cholo that I caught up in Boyle Heights ?
You know, that low-level dealer ?
What ?
- I patted him down...
- Eddie, stay with me
- Why don't you just listen ?
- All right.
In... booking,
I find out that he's got a little 5-shot just jammed in his belt, and he coulda popped us at any time,
and I didn't catch it'cause I was tweaking.
So I look at this guy, and I say, "you know, why...
why didn't you shoot me ?"
And he... he just looks at me and he said, "because you seem like a nice guy."
I should be dead, and you should be dead.
We... all of us should be dead because of me.
- It's over, man.
- No, it's not over.
Eddie, listen, we can all walk out of here together.
- Whoa, hey, hey, hey !
- Eddie, no !
I didn't make the call, Eddie.
You hear me ?
I didn't make the call.
All right ?
But I didn't warn you, either.
Now I'd heard that the drug test was coming down, and I knew you were using, but what's on me is that I coulda helped you, and I didn't, and now I'm asking... all right ?
There.
I'm asking you now, please,
let me help you now.
- No.
- Eddie ?
Let me help you.
Let me help you this time.
Okay.
I got you.
- Okay.
- Sorry.
All right.
all right.
I'm so sorry.
- Morning.
- Hey, good morning.
I didn't hear you get up.
- I didn't want to wake you.
- I like when you wake me.
Is everything okay ?
The phone is ringing.
Yeah, that's that's what it does.
- This hasn't happened before.
- What, someone calling you ?
- Are you kidding ?
- No, it's not that.
Something's changed.
- Andrea.
- Hey, Hopper.
So... this might sound a little out of the blue, but...
I'm taking Eddie to rehab this morning.
There's a lot to tell you.
You still there ?
You didn't have to come.
I can do this without you.
Yeah, well, I just wanted to see for myself.
You know, you threw a lot at me on the phone.
Sorry.
It's just... when I woke up today, I felt...
I felt different.
Different ?
Like...
like how ?
Like I had this weird urge to call you, and then all this stuff came out, and... it's strange.
I've been feeling so hopeless, but today, I don't know.
So it... it's good ?
Yeah, and even with this I.A. Stuff, I mean,
I woke up with the strangest idea.
Why don't I just tell Chad the truth ?
I'd like to think that, uh, you know, he wouldn't crucify you, but...
Yeah, I've already called my league rep and told him that's what I'm gonna do, so...
If I get days, I get days.
And... if I loose my job... at least I'm not dead.
What ?
Why... why does that make you laugh ?
No, it's... this just isn't the day that I expected to have.
Yeah, me neither... but here we are.
What about Eddie ?
Well, I don't think he's happy to be pushed out of the nest.
I don't think it's gonna be easy either way.
What are you looking at ?
- My old partner.
- Don't look so smug.
I'll break my foot off in your ass, cabron.
So you got any gas in this piece of crap, or what ?
What, is this this some kind of joke ?
What are you talking about ?
Like I'm supposed to see this, and it'll remind me of what kind of cop I used to be or some garbage like that ?
What's supposed to remind you of that ?
This stupid picture that you dug up.
- You knew about that picture ?
- Yeah, I should.
- I was the first officer on scene.
- What ?
Jane Doe.
Body dumped in a car off Figueroa.
I was a rookie.
I didn't know much.
That's when I first met your old man.
He was okay.
My father was there ?
Yeah, he was the lead detective on it.
But he didn't close it.
Evidence went missing, and it just all fell apart.
It's funny how they always hinge on some little, stupid thing.

My name is detective Brett Hopper, and this is the day that changes everything.
Freeze!
You're under arrest for the murder of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza.
I will be framed for murder...
Who the hell are you people?
My girlfriend Rita will be in danger.
I know all this because I am living the same day... over and over again.
The day is the same, but different things happen.
Every morning, I get another chance.
For every decision, there's a consequence.
I can save my sister Jennifer...
- You're acting really crazy.
- There isn't any time!
What is this about?
I can track down every lead.
Hopper, you should have received a package today.
The message on your answerphone came from the home of a U.S. Attorney, Nathan Baxter.
Anything else you're not telling me, partner?
But today, I need some answers...
You called and left me a message about this package.
- Who told you to call me?
- Garza.
...before it's too late.
If I get here earlier tomorrow, I might be able to help her.
Hopper, I need your help.
I've done something terrible.
I love you.
I love you, too.
When will I see you again?
Tomorrow.
I'll see you tomorrow.
- Rita?
- Hopper, I need your help.
I've done something terrible.
Andrea?
Tell me what happened.
It's Eddie...
I think I killed him.
Okay, why don't you take me through it?
He came over.
He was high.
He was tweaking so bad.
He got violent and...
I fought back.
And... he went... over.
God, he's dead!
- This is my fault.
- No, no, it's not.
We both knew what Eddie was into.
I didn't mean to kill him.
Just stop it.
He brought this here.
You were defending yourself.
We're gonna fix this.
We'll leave him at his apartment.
There's a pay phone around the corner.
We can call 9-1-1 from there.
You okay?
I know you've got problems of your own, Hopper.
I just didn't know where else to turn.
He was my partner, too.
When was the last time you talked to him?
Couple of months, maybe.
You know if he was still using?
I don't know.
I mean, how long did we work with him before either of us realized, right?
Yeah.
Eddie had his secr...
I didn't feel a pulse, I swear to God!
- Hang in there, man.
- We gotta get him to a hospital.
St. Francis is the closest one,
- but it's the other way.
- St. Francis.
Okay.
You're gonna be okay, man.
- I can lose him.
- No!
No, if we run, he'll have a bird on us in minutes.
I don't think Eddie's got minutes.
So we can't waste 'em by going nascar against a black and white.
Just be cool.
All right, hang in there, man.
We're gonna get you some help.
Hang in.
Narcotics.
These are my partners.
We're on the job.
What happened to him?
He was UC on a buy bust.
Took a hit from a couple of bangers.
We're taking him to a hospital.
Let's go.
We've got an injured officer here.
61-14, I've got an injured officer at Alvarado and Glendale with his partners.
Show me escorting to St. Francis Memorial Hospital.
Code three.
Follow me.
You know I can't go in there.
I know.
I know.
I got this.
Need help over here!
Come on, this side, this side!
Where's your other partner?
- Hey.
- I didn't even hear you get up.
- I just...
I didn't want to wake you.
- I like when you wake me.
Now you're all dressed, and I've missed all the good parts.
That's a good part, too.
Baby girl, I'm trying to get an early start.
But save me some of that for later, all right?
Well, later it might be all gone.
Sweetie, it was...
It was just a joke.
Oh, no, I know.
I just...
I got a...
I got a lot on my mind.
You wanna tell me about it?
It's Andrea.
I think she may be caught up in something with Eddie Reyes.
- Eddie?
- Yeah.
I haven't heard his name since he got fired.
Well, he popped up yesterday.
So what exactly are those two caught up in?
I don't know.
Trying to figure that out.
Eddie's had a rough time of it.
I hope he's not in any more trouble.
Please.
Eddie ain't nothing but trouble.
I gotta go.
I have to see this lady about a package.
- Lady?
- It's evidence.
Might be important.
- Battle.
- Hey.
I know this is a little bit sudden.
You gotta stay away from Eddie today.
Hopper, what the hell are you talking about?
I think he's using again.
Listen, if he calls, don't pick up.
If he comes over, do not let him in.
- Where are you getting this?
- Just trust me.
Stay away from Eddie today.
Okay?
Okay, yeah, I got it.
Who was that?
Hopper.
He says I should stay away from you.
Typical Hopper.
All I'm saying is, why today?
The same day that you gotta go to I.A, he calls out of the blue to talk about me.
He must know something.
Then why didn't he say something about us?
He did.
He said to stay away from me.
You know how Hopper gets an idea in his head.
He can't let it go.
You mean like, how he got me canned?
Come on.
You know that's not true.
Thought you were on my side.
I am.
Come on, baby.
I'm just worried about you, you know?
You just said so yourself...
Hopper gets an idea in his head, he doesn't let it go.
He's going to I.A. today, too, and what if he knows what you've been doing?
- He doesn't.
- Then why he call this morning and tell you to stay away from me?
Is there something you're not telling me?
Like what?
Come on, baby, of course not.
You've seen me at my worst, spun out.
There's nothing I can hide from you.
Hey, how about I take you to la Cabañita tonight?
You know you don't have to.
I'd like to.
Even a rent-a-cop can afford that.
They played me some voice mail, a woman talking about some package they sent to you.
They think it is tied to Garza.
You called and left me a message about this package.
- Ava, I'm Brett Hopper.
- How did you find me?
Don't worry about that.
Where's Baxter?
He's in the shower.
Now I know that you work for Garza.
I know that he had you send me a package.
I need to know why.
Garza never told me.
Why are you asking me, anyway?
Why don't you just talk to him?
Garza's dead.
He was killed last night.
My God.
When?
I mean, why would anybody...
Right now I'm trying to figure all that out, but
I think it may have something to do with that package you sent me.
I need you to tell me everything.
Garza was acting nervous.
When he brought the packages, they were both sealed.
I didn't see what was inside.
He just said to send them.
- There were two packages?
- You didn't know?
Yeah, I sent one to you and one to someone... someone named...
Mathis.
Jennifer Mathis?
You know her?
She's my sister.
Put your clothes on and get the hell out of here.
You're in danger, too.
And stay away from Baxter.
- Wait, so you never received a package?
- No, I haven't gotten anything.
You never got it.
Your husband must have taken it.
- Randall?
- Tell Randall I'm coming to see him.
Brett, that doesn't...
He's not here.
Where is he?
He left work and went home.
He got a call.
Our alarm went off.
- What?
- No, it's okay.
- It happens by mistake...
- Stay there.
I'm coming to get you.
Hey.
You were supposed to be at work.
I was worried about you, after your I.A. meeting, you know?
Hopper calling this morning and all.
So what did you tell 'em?
Slow down, slow down.
They know what?
About Slim... everything, okay?
They've got pictures and bank statements.
I don't know what I'm gonna do here, Eddie.
- They say anything about me?
- This is my ass we're talking about.
Come on, don't be that way, baby.
- Hopper's the one who did this to us.
- This wasn't Hopper, okay?
Hopper's wanted for murder.
- What?
- They say he killed the A.D.A, Garza, and they want me to help bring him in.
Offered me a deal.
I roll on Hopper and they drop the case.
- What're you gonna do?
- It's my partner.
What if he did it?
Then you help bring down a murderer, and you walk away clean.
- And what if he didn't?
- Well, then you help prove his innocence, right?
And everybody wins.
- Eddie, I can't...
- No, baby, no.
You take this deal, I.A. Goes away.
Slim goes away.
I can try and clear my record.
I mean, this could be a second chance for both of us.
I didn't roll on you and I'm not gonna do it to Hopper.
Do you always side with that guy?
They just told you he killed somebody and yet you're still backing him.
What about us?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Are you using again?
You think I'd do that to myself, to you,
- after everything you've done?
- It's just a question.
It's a question Hopper put there, right?
That's what he told you this morning.
So he doesn't just get me fired, he gets to ruin us.
Probably just take his side on that one, too?
Randall, it's me again.
Call me.
This isn't like him.
I'm gonna kill him.
What?
- Nothing.
- Don't "nothing" me.
You pull me out of class, you drag me home and you won't even tell me
- what the hell's going on.
- I would if I knew, but for now... you're safer with me.
Safer?
What are you talking about?
Are we in some kind of danger?
- Is Randall?
- I don't know!
I can totally tell when you're lying...
I just wish you'd be a little bit more worried about yourself and a little less about your husband.
What is that supposed to mean?
It's Randall's car.
Jen, wait!
Let...
Let me check the house first.
- Hopper, we need to talk.
- Yeah, I...
I'm a little busy right now, Andrea.
Look, you called me this morning, okay?
I need your help!
Andrea, I gotta call you back.
The whole place is tossed.
Nobody's here.
Why would anybody do this to us?
I think they're looking for that package.
Do you think they have Randall?
Forget Randall.
- What?
- For all we know, he could be involved in this.
What is wrong with you?
My house is turned upside down, my husband is missing and all you can say is that maybe it's his fault?
All I'm saying is that it's a possibility.
You never liked him.
You always assume the worst in people.
I'm following my instincts, all right?
It's my job.
That's right, your instincts.
That's why I don't hear from you for a month!
That's why you missed your niece's birthday!
What are you talking about right now?
Look, I'm sorry if I don't have time for the perfect family
- and the perfect life...
- It's not about being perfect.
It is about being there!
That's why your relationship with mom
- is so screwed up...
- What?
My relationsh...
You keep turning her against me.
That's what's wrong
- with ma!
- Right!
It's never your fault.
You are just like dad.
You wanna play it like that?
Where'd you get these bruises on your arm, Jennifer?
Where'd you get those?
- What?
- What?
Yeah, I know about 'em.
You don't understand.
You don't!
Wha...
Brett?
- Randall, how did they find me?
- I don't know, Brett!
- Did you tell 'em?
- No, I swear to god
I didn't tell 'em!
They took me, and then they were gonna get Jen, and they looked at that thing on the dash and they knew.
I think it's a GPS or something.
What the hell are you doing?
Where is the package?
- What did you do with it?
- I don't know any...
I don't believe you!
Stop it!
Let him go!
I'm going to count to three, you hear me?
One...
Two...
- Please don't...
- I have it!
I hid it... okay?
I was scared.
I got a call;
they said "Don't tell anyone"
and I opened it and I saw that.
- Do you know who this woman is?
- No.
I thought it was some kind of threat, so I hid it.
I didn't even tell Randall.
Jen, I'm a cop.
This is what I deal with.
I can protect you.
- Why didn't you ask me for help?
- I tried.
- When?
- Last night.
I called you six times.
And I called you back.
You said your phone was broken.
- What?
- Yes!
You never called me back.
The cops are coming.
Get the hell off my property.
...now find themselves in the number two spot in the B.C.S. rankings...
I'm closing my tabs.
- Anything else?
- No, thanks.
Tough shift, huh?
Just be glad your day's not as bad as mine.
...notre Dame, the only team in the preseason top five still holding that distinction.
...in baseball, the Dodgers have once again defied expectation, by coming back from the dead with a 7-run rally in the bottom of the 9th to beat the Giants 11-10.
I knew it.
I told you this would happen.
But nobody believed me.
Didn't I say this would happen?
I shoulda put money on that bitch.
Hey, man, uh...
How did you know they'd win?
Because the Dodgers rule!
...the Mets should probably clinch the division for next season.
Right.
Yeah.
Go, blue.
Go, blue.
Yes, this is detective Spivak.
I'm looking into an old case.
The D.R. Number is 91
4641.
Okay.
Well, could you transfer me then, please?
So someone checked out the murder book.
I need to know who.
What did you say?
Internal Affairs pulled a murder book.
I need to know the name of the requester.
Well then, what time do they open?
Hello?
Hello!
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.
Thank god.
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Brett, you know what they're saying.
They brought me in, they asked me questions, told me terrible things.
I know.
I'm sorry they put you through all that.
You know none of it's true.
I didn't believe it.
éI love you.
I love you, too.
Now...
I have to ask you a favor.
Honey, I need to speak to Chad.
I don't have time to explain.
I know he's there.
That's fine.
I just need to speak to him, because it's very, very important.
It's for you.
It's...
Brett.
- Heya, partner.
- Internal affairs pulled a murder book for a case from 1991.
I need you to tell me who.
Classic Hopper...
Target of a citywide manhunt, but it's still "I need, I need, I need. "
- I'm trying to prove my innocence here.
- Great!
Come on into the station, we'll talk all about it.
Why don't you come get me?
I'm at the corner of...
Andrea, please tell me that you did not see Eddie today.
Hello?
You turned her against me.
- Eddie?
- You did it, Hopper.
- Remember that.
- Eddie!
What are you doing?
Put it down!
I like when you wake me.
Now you're all dressed, and I've already missed all the good parts.
That's a good part, too.
- You remember Eddie Reyes?
- Of course I do.
Are you still feeling bad
- about how that went down?
- No...
It's Andrea.
I feel like she may be getting caught up in something with him.
Like what?
I don't know.
It might have to do with the I.A. investigations, though.
Whatever it is, it's not gonna end well.
How could you possibly know that?
Because I've seen it happen before.
Yeah, but the difference is you.
You've seen this kind of thing happen before, so why don't you help her?
Don't let it happen.
It might not be that simple.
Well, then at least you tried.
Be safe today... okay?
You, too.
That thing on the dash...
I think it's a GPS or something.
- What are you doing here?
- I need to talk to you.
I know this is coming out of nowhere, but...
You gotta stay away from Eddie today.
- What?
- Yeah, he's using again so if you see him it'll end bad for the both of you.
Where is he?
- What he...
- Where is he?
Hey Hopper.
You got a lot of cojones, coming here saying that crap about me.
You lied to me.
You've been all business with me for the last six months.
Now all of a sudden we're best friends,
- confiding secrets in each other?
- I never hid anything from you.
Like the fact you've been looking into the latin disciples?
Thought I didn't know?
How is what we do together
- any of your business?
- You stay out of this.
You lost the right to tell me what to do when you asked for a drug test that got me fired.
- It's not what happened.
- And I am to believe you didn't know?
- You weren't doing your job!
- That's right.
You just had to protect your reputation...
And now you're gonna screw Andrea the way you screwed me.
You're on your own.
This is Chad Shelton.
Chad, it's Hopper.
Didn't expect to hear from you so early.
The meeting's at 3:00.
- I had a question for you.
- I got some questions for you too.
I was gonna wait to ask them in person.
So, then, uh, we're still on?
I'm sure we're both looking forward to spending this quality time together.
- So why are you calling me?
- I'm looking into this... homicide from 1991.
Now the records say that Internal Affairs pulled the murder book
Do you have any idea who?
I can't wait to help you out with that, buddy.
Can I get you anything else?
Maybe walk your dog for you?
Wash your car?
Maybe you wanna sleep with my ex-wife?
Oh, wait...
Punk...
Tough day?
Yeah.
Things'll look up.
- What can I bring you?
- Just... some coffee, please.
This is detective Spivak calling from Homicide.
I'm looking for records...
Yes, I will hold.
Well, I know Internal Affairs has it.
I'm trying to find who.
Can I speak to your Lieutenant?
I need to talk to your Captain.
This is the Los Angeles Police Department.
Your call is important to us.
Your estimated wait time is 15 minutes.
Let me ask you something, woman.
This look like white wine to you?
Oh no, I know you didn't just do that!
Now bring me what I ordered.
- Yeah?
- Detective Hopper,
I understand you've been making some calls.
- Who is this?
- It's not going to be that easy.
You're going to admit to killing alberto Garza.
Well, you're calling me... whoever you are, so you must want something.
I'll get right to the point.
You do have something I'm looking for.
The packages...
Very good, detective Hopper.
Okay, you want the packages.
I want some answers.
You bring what you have to Elysian Park.
There are some picnic tables.
The one on the north end at 2:00 P.M.
and I'll bring you all the answers you need.
Okay.
If I get there, and it looks like a trap, I'm gone.
Detective Hopper, you act as though you have a choice.
Andrea, I cannot do this now, okay?
I tried to help you early this morning.
You're on your own now.
Please, Hopper.
Andrea?
I need your help.
It's Eddie.
- I made a terrible mistake.
- What happened with Eddie?
I can't go to the police because of I.A, and Eddie...
Look, I need you right now.
And no one else can help me.
If we don't find him, he's dead.
Please, Hopper.
I can't do this alone.
You bring what you have to Elysian park, and I will bring you all the answers you need.
You don't always get to choose who you fall in love with though, right?
I mean, I knew Eddie had been using, but I thought that was behind us.
I mean,
I helped him get clean.
He was better.
I didn't think it was gonna be like that again.
What happened?
You did... this morning.
After you left, he got so mad.
He started throwing things.
He ran off... and then he found me here at the market later.
I've seen him like this before, and I know he's gonna do something stupid.
He had his old.38, and I know he's gonna score.
Where does he go to score?
Danny Yan.
Slim?
Your C.I?
Yeah.
What exactly is Eddie mixed up in?
There's a lot more bounce than bouncer for club like this.
I know, something's wrong.
None of Slim's guys are on the floor.
Get everyone out there.
He doesn't leave this neighborhood.
Battle.
I should've known.
- Where's Eddie?
- We had a little disagreement.
What did you do?
Tell me something, babe.
How does a pathetic tweaker like Eddie score such a sweet slice of pie like you?
Yeah, keep talking, Slim.
I will shoot your ass.
I'm a victim here.
I just got assaulted in my place of business by your boyfriend,
- which by the way, doubles your juice.
- Shut up.
Hopper doesn't know about our little arrangement, right?
You want to arrest somebody detective, try our star-crossed lovers here.
One of them's got a nasty habit he can't keep up with, and the other one, well... can you put somebody away for being an enabler?
- Don't.
- See, when Eddie was on the job, he got used to taking home free samples, but ex-cops don't get glass for free, so Charlie's Angel here kept bailing him out.
Straight out of Shakespeare, man.
So sad...
Did you wake up this morning and decide you wanted a bullet in your head?
Because the day I'm having, you do not wanna get on my bad side.
- All I'm saying...
- Where's Eddie?
Somewhere on foot between the 110 and the Cornfields.
Chinatown ain't that big, man.
You better hope you find him before we do.
Yeah, you better hope we do, too.
You were paying off that dirtbag?
That's what I.A.'S got on you?
- It's not that simple.
- Yeah, it is.
You were giving money to a drug dealer.
They were gonna kill Eddie, okay?
I couldn't report it.
I didn't have a choice.
Do you have any idea what I gave up to help you?
My family, Rita...
their lives are in danger because I'm being framed for murder, and today I had a chance to find the guy behind it, maybe even stop it, but I didn't.
I helped you instead.
- I'm sorry, Hopper.
- "Sorry"?
"Sorry" doesn't keep me out of jail, or Rita from getting killed.
"Sorry" doesn't end is damn day.
"Sorry"...
Every morning...
I wake up and I think:
"maybe today'll be different", but it always ends the same.
He's 30 days clean, and I'm back in Slim's parking lot, hoping to God I find Eddie alive.
But I can't give up, because what if today it is different?
Maybe today he kicks it, or he dies.
If it were someone you loved, wouldn't you do everything that you could to save them?
I know where Eddie's gonna be.
- He's gonna show up near here.
- How do you know that?
Trust me, just keep looking.
- I take inside you take the street?
- Yeah.
- Your keys.
- Put down the gun.
Keys, now.
Keys, now.
- Come on, baby, just...
- Eddie, don't do this.
Don't do this.
You never got it, did you, Hopper?
You just... you didn't even try to understand.
- Please, Eddie...
- I'm talking here, baby.
All right, what didn't I understand?
I got seven years on you, and you still made d-2 before I did.
You know, I mean, not everybody's a super cop.
I just wanted a little relief.
- Okay?
- Okay, I get that.
I get that.
But your beef is with me, not Andrea, so let her go, man.
- Just put down your gun.
- You know I can't do that.
Eddie, come on, it doesn't have to go down like this.
You know that cholo that I caught up in Boyle Heights?
You know, that low-level dealer?
What?
I patted him down, I swear I did.
- Why don't you just listen?
- All right.
In, booking,
I find out that he's got a little 5-shot just jammed in his belt, and he coulda popped us at any time,
and I didn't catch it 'cause I was tweaking.
So I look at this guy, and I ask him, you know:
"why didn't you shoot me?"
And he just looks at me and he said:
"because you seem like a nice guy. "
I should be dead, and you should be dead.
We, all of us should be dead because of me.
- It's over, man.
- No, it's not over.
Eddie, listen, we can all walk out of here together.
I didn't make the call, Eddie.
You hear me?
I didn't make the call.
All right?
But I didn't warn you, either.
Now I'd heard that the drug test was coming down, and I knew you were using.
But what's on me is that I coulda helped you, and I didn't, and I'm asking... all right?
There.
I'm asking you now, please, let me help you now.
Eddie?
Let me help you.
Let me help you this time.
I got you.
- Okay.
- Sorry.
All right.
I'm so sorry.
- Morning.
- Hey, good morning.
- I didn't hear you get up.
- I didn't want to wake you.
I like when you wake me.
Is everything okay?
The phone is ringing.
Yeah, that's what it does.
This hasn't happened before.
What, someone calling you?
Are you kidding?
No, it's not that.
Something's changed.
- Andrea.
- Hey, Hopper.
So... this might sound a little out of the blue, but...
I'm taking Eddie to rehab this morning.
There's a lot to tell you.
You still there?
You didn't have to come, you know.
I can do this without you.
Wanted to see it myself.
You know, you threw a lot at me on the phone.
Sorry.
It's just... when I woke up today, I felt...
I felt different.
Different?
Like...
Like how?
Like I had this weird urge to call you, and then all this stuff came out, and... it's strange.
I've been feeling so... hopeless, but today, I don't know.
It's good?
Yeah, and even with this I.A. Stuff, I mean,
I woke up with the strangest idea, why don't I just tell Chad the truth?
I'd like to think that, you know, he wouldn't crucify you, but...
Yeah, well, I've already called my league rep and told him that's what I'm gonna do, so...
If I get days, I get days.
And, if I lose my job, at least I'm not dead.
What?
Why does that make you laugh?
No, it's this just isn't the day that I expected to have.
Yeah, me neither... but here we are.
What about Eddie?
Well, I don't think he's happy to be pushed out of the nest.
I don't think it's gonna be easy either way.
- What are you looking at?
- My old partner.
Don't look so smug.
I'll break my foot off in your ass, cabron.
So you got any gas in this piece of crap, or what?
What, is this some kind of joke?
- What are you talking about?
- Like I'm supposed to see this, and it'll remind me of what kind of cop
I used to be or some garbage like that?
What's supposed to remind you of that?
This stupid picture that you dug up.
- You knew about that picture?
- Yeah,
I should.
I was the first officer on scene.
- What?
- Jane Doe.
Body dumped in a car off Figueroa.
I was a rookie.
I didn't know much.
That's when I first met your old man.
He was okay.
- My father was there?
- Yeah, he was the lead detective on it.
But he didn't close it.
Evidence went missing and it just all fell apart.
It's funny how they always hinge on some little, stupid thing.
COMRADE PEDERSEN
Good morning.
There is a widespread assumption that the world is progressing.
You are, as far as I can see, evidence of the opposite.
As everyone knows, Norway is one of the richest countries in the world.
So it's perhaps a little strange to think that a political movement started in this country around 1970 that attracted hordes of eager students and young intellectuals, inspired by a peasant's son from China.
And they decided to mobilise the people against the state.
And overthrow it through an armed revolution.
It's true.
That movement was called AKP (m-l).
Thousands joined the movement, including myself, a few years later.
The movement was clearer, colder, more cynically calculating here than in any other country.
With giant China as its ideological ideal.
For me it all started when I moved to Larvik in the '60s to teach.
I don't remember the year.
But I do remember the hemlines.
The future seemed open to me.
I could take what I wanted from life.
You have to gain her confidence.
Show her the holes in your socks.
That makes a strong impression.
It's disgusting, but you've no choice.
See, that's the only thing that makes you interesting.
Show how helpless you are.
Cultivate your weak sides, never your strong.
And most important, do it in the presence of others.
- I should make a fool of myself?
- Exactly!
That sure went well, Pedersen.
Unlike Gunnar, I didn't just want a woman.
I wanted marriage.
Children.
At the ripe old age of 28, I had a desperate desire to settle down.
I wanted to walk with my child on a tricycle beside me.
And he'd look up and say, "Daddy?"
And I'd say, "Yes?
What is it now?"
LIBRARY
It's about the cultural climate of German composer Arnold Sch^nberg.
I can warm you up.
If you...
If you want.
What are you reading?
Celine.
Journey to the End of the Night.
Is it good?
I have to admit that I spied on her on occasion.
But not out of wickedness.
Only out of curiosity.
Domestically, happiness had reached new heights.
But outside Larvik city limits things were very different.
High standard?
What the hell is this high standard?
High standard.
What the hell is high standard?
Why you want a car and a house when guilt is consuming you?
How can you be so smug...
- 1814.
What happened?
- The Constitution.
And in 1821, the Aristocracy Law.
Pedersen?
Werner?
Do you know what my great-grandfather voted in 1851?
No?
He didn't vote.
Do you know why not, Pedersen?
He wasn't entitled to.
You can't judge the past by the standards of the present.
Maybe not, but we need to look at the way you teach history.
This classroom has an authoritarian structure.
Makes it hard to have a proper conversation.
- You think I'm too authoritarian?
- No, you're not.
We like you.
But this classroom is too restrictive.
We're sitting in line here.
It's very military.
You're up there, we're down here.
We can get more out of you.
Can I just show you one idea?
Say no if you think it's too much.
If we just move the desks.
Break up the structure a bit.
Isn't that a lot freer?
There is a reason for my standing up here.
If we learn more the higher up you stand, you should be squashed up under the ceiling.
If everyone pushes their desks against the wall...
Don't get up, Pedersen.
Tell me, why were the pupils sitting on the floor during class?
Did you sing?
No.
I didn't even know the song, so...
No, but perhaps it had a catchy refrain?
I won't deny that, but...
No, I did not sing.
It's easy to join in a song, if the refrain is catchy.
I agree.
But no.
No, I did not sing.
But it's so easy.
Your lips begin to move, your throat fills...
No.
I just stood there.
I didn't even sing inside.
Did you really stand up?
Yes, I really stood up.
But I'm not one of them.
I had to be polite.
That's what this is about.
I was being courteous.
You realize you must apologize to the parents?
I can only apologize that there is nothing to apologize for.
Obviously China is an example to be followed.
- The people have taken power there.
- China is an interesting case.
But don't forget, China is an ancient culture.
This is not about history.
It's about the class struggle.
In China the people have taken power.
Well, teacher...
I don't suppose you noticed milk went up 15 øre last week?
My meeting with the worker Jan Klåstad fostered a dramatic expectation of what the future held in store.
- My God!
I'm dangerous.
- Yes, you are.
The intellectual petite bourgeoisie has the power to influence others' views and actions.
The question is, who will you serve?
Now, under capitalism, and later, under real socialism?
So what you're asking is, will I serve the working class?
You won't be free until you're on our side.
Then there's the paper...
You got any change?
- It's not that important.
- How much do you need?
One, two, three, four...
Hi.
Most typical of AKP (m-l), was its security policy.
The meetings were top secret.
Obviously, these security precautions were very time-consuming.
Comrades!
Who was the Soviet State industrialised for?
Who were all these sacrifices made for?
For the people.
The people.
Boldly, I went out into the world to serve the people.
Although I struggled with my working class accent for years.
The Class Struggle!
Unite!
Everyone now!
Power to the people!
One leader!
The Class Struggle!
One people, one state!
Power to the people!
Unite!
Stand together!
The Class Struggle.
The Class Struggle.
The Class Struggle?
The Class...
My life has changed.
I have become utterly consumed by these fantastic visions.
Thanks to the good grades I, among others, gave him -
- Werner went off to study engineering in Trondheim.
I'll miss our conversations.
- Goodbye, Werner.
- Goodbye, Comrade.
But I sure didn't miss him for long.
A new Comrade was arriving.
Going out this late?
Yes.
A meeting at school.
Don't wait up.
That sick teacher simply refuses to get any better.
See you later.
I'm from the bourgeoisie.
My father is a professor of medicine.
Like him, I am also a doctor.
I grew up in a wealthy part of Oslo.
My parents let me develop freely.
And I've been subjected to very little oppression at home.
But when I joined the Communist Party to create a socialist Norway, their tolerance ran out.
I broke with my parents.
I have served the people for four years now.
Finally, I must point out my weaknesses as a Communist.
I don't anticipate the Revolution with any joy.
I work for it day and night, but I carry an inner fear of the revolutionary moment and the upheaval it will bring about.
Does your fear stem from your bourgeois upbringing?
No.
It's a weakness, but not specifically bourgeois.
I think the working class also fears the bloody consequences.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.
We don't think like that.
The bourgeoisie has tried to pump that fear into us for generations.
It is only natural to fear a revolution.
Every normal person fears bloodshed.
Nonetheless, fear can impede political activity.
So it is my duty to mention it.
In this world nothing is impossible as long as the people dare rise up.
- What do you think of Stalin?
- I love Stalin.
You love Stalin?
What do you love about him?
His personality?
His actions?
Perhaps a cheeky combination of both?
I just think we should make a clear distinction between some fluffy bunny and Stalin.
He was a lunatic.
I'm glad the bastard has been dead for 20 years.
We don't always need to praise someone just because...
Obviously he was a competent man...
in his own field... in his own way.
Bye.
There you go.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I bought a... record today.
The Sawmill Songs.
The new record by Homespun.
Want to come home with me and listen to it?
I agreed to, in spite of my limited musical knowledge.
Oh, Comrade!
Thank you.
I'm a crack marksman.
Bet you didn't know that.
I have to go home now.
- Hi.
- That took longer than expected.
Had a good day?
Yes.
Gunnar's a weird bloke.
What are you reading?
One Hundred Years of Solitude.
A lot of hard-core pornography is circulating in the workplace.
The working class is being tricked into spending loads of money on it.
That's a fuckin' lie.
There may be porn inside the factory gates.
Specially on the night shift.
It gets passed round and they all snigger.
But that is on the outside.
Inside they feel degraded by looking at naked women with shaven pussies.
Comrade Balder...
Tolfsen!
Shaven pussies.
Academics.
Proles...
Proletarians.
Workers...
Workers.
Library.
Shaven pussies.
Comrade...
Hi.
I've joined the Party.
And I thought you were being unfaithful...
BONJOUR TRISTESSE
We recruit.
We use cover names.
And you can't reveal your cover name?
- No.
Or I'd have to hurt you.
- Lf I guessed it?
- I don't know.
- Hurt?
You mean liquidate?
Maybe.
- Ivan?
Igor?
- No.
Red Fox?
- Am I getting warm?
- No, you're way off.
Compose yourself, Pedersen.
- Suppose I think they're right?
- Take a look around you!
- An armed revolution?
- Yes.
- Here?
- Yes.
Jesus Christ...
It's not that I'm stupid.
The Revolution isn't right round the corner.
But capitalism won't last forever.
Who will be there when it disappears?
Do you think capitalism will last forever?
No.
You don't believe that.
You're not that stupid!
How can you even entertain such a thought?
Come on!
It'll be great fun.
Armed revolution!
For the first time in my life I began to skip school.
What seems to be your problem?
No, but listen:
Why do people think they always have to have real things?
Plastic!
It's practical, useful and cheap.
That's why it's beautiful.
I've got plastic flowers at home.
They don't wilt.
Perfect for the active Communist.
In a funny way they look real.
Even more real than real flowers.
Sometimes they get this velvety layer.
So my mum gives them a wipe when she's cleaning, and they come up like new.
Plastic is beautiful.
Give me the pure and the proud
Those with patience and courage
And willpower to spare
Give me those who never will betray our great ideals...
Envelope nr 1:
"Go to the ferry landing in Horten."
"Take the ferry to Moss."
"Drive to Askim railway station."
So it's Østfold county again this year.
Østfold is nice.
SWEDISH BORDER 4 KM
"Cross the border.
Wait at Karlstad Hotel."
Brilliant!
Who would expect Vestfold AKP to have their annual meeting abroad?
That wasn't so bad.
It's no good.
It's too cold.
In this world nothing is impossible, as long as the people dare rise up.
She blasphemed, tenderly, in my ear.
And she was right.
In this world, nothing is impossible.
Chairman Mao would have liked this.
The first item on the agenda:
What constitutes the primary conflict in the world today?
Yes, Comrade Hilde?
I have had a clandestine affair with a married male Comrade.
I request the floor for self-criticism.
Shouldn't we rather discuss issues of national importance?
Sort those petit bourgeois things out for yourself.
I have had a decadent relationship with Comrade Eivind.
We have committed adultery.
A woman of the people has been hurt.
Eivind's wife.
We used the Party to keep it secret, so I have to ask:
What kind of Party do we want?
This is not some private matter!
It's a matter of life and death for the Party.
It's reactionary to tolerate a relationship like this.
What use is a Party that does nothing when I betray a woman of the people?
I don't need a Party like that.
A Party like that can never lead the people in their uprising.
I stand here because I don't want to rot.
I can't stand becoming a capitalist destiny.
That's why I became a Communist and joined this Party.
Do something!
Exterminate me if necessary, or give me a final warning.
But show that you mean it when you say that this Party will lead the people in the battle against all oppressors everywhere.
Thank you.
I, too, offer self-criticism.
But more as a matter of principle.
I don't regret what I've done.
I had a wonderful time.
The relationship's secret nature definitely made it more exciting.
I understand it's a breach of Party guidelines.
I accept that.
But I have been incredibly happy with Comrade Hilde.
Thank you.
The District Council issued a warning for breach of Party Regulations paragraph 12, section 1.
Quite a serious matter.
Hi.
I don't think anyone noticed that my personal life was in ruins.
I think you should go back to your marriage.
And stay there.
Do you still love me a little?
Next.
Hi.
- It's raining.
- Yes.
Thanks.
The mention of her name is enough to...
I cry out inside, and...
I don't know what's wrong with me.
Her smell, and...
It's like an explosion inside me.
I've never loved anyone as much as her.
Her voice when she says my name.
And "Comrade."
Comrade...
That was stupid of you.
- Yes.
- Yes.
So there's no chance of?
- No.
- No.
- Good night.
- Good night.
You can stay here for the time being.
I hope you'll like it.
What now began was the golden age of AKP (m-l).
I loved Nina more than ever.
But my plan was to act normal.
Well, Nina, here we are again.
Bright-eyed and bushy tailed.
Nina?
I wonder how the workers coped without us?
Must have been a sad state of affairs without us.
The belief that we would get back together was definitely there.
Only the girls are to sing the melody here, but some of the lads come in and ruin it.
Come on, Comrades.
Let's get started.
Harald, have you been to Ferdinand's Pub recently?
Yes, last Friday.
- Was it fun?
- Yes, it was OK.
- What did you do?
- Drank a few beers.
How many?
Three, perhaps?
- That's 42 kroner.
- Yes.
- Go there often?
- Maybe once a week.
And drink three beers?
Stop it, Nina.
A man's allowed to drink a couple of beers.
I'm just pointing out that it costs 42 kroner a week.
Money that the Party could put to good use.
- Why do you go to Ferdinand's?
- To have a good time.
Meet people.
Couldn't you drink coffee?
Give me a break!
You expect me to drink coffee when everyone else is drinking beer?
Yes.
Lots of people do.
Those who are driving, for example.
If you must drink, do it at home.
With your friends at home.
That alone would mean an extra 20 kroner for the Party.
You can still go to Ferdinand's for one beer.
Sip it, make it last.
Is that such a bad idea?
Anyway, after the Revolution, everyone will drink tea.
Hi...
- Hi.
- Hi.
Are you seeing Jan Klåstad now?
Answer me!
- The man is an animal.
- Knut!
I knew it was bourgeois of me to be jealous, especially of a worker.
Knut...
Sure you don't want to come with us?
- Are you getting tired?
- Yes.
Do you want to go to mummy?
What have you got there?
We'll see each other just as often, even though you're moving a thousand miles away.
Knut!
Knut!
The USA has been driven out by the Vietnamese!
I knew it was only a political embrace.
But I took what little I could get.
There must be more than this.
Have you seen Anna Nicolaysen and her husband?
They promised to come!
Damn!
- I don't see Marit Knutsen either.
- Come on, let's line up.
How many are we?
Sixty.
Count the baby carriages, too.
Don't forget.
And count all the wheels.
NATO out of Norway!
USA out of Cambodia!
You shouldn't joke about the baby carriages.
Those babies aren't here of their own free will.
It would be an insult not to count them.
Imagine the pride, knowing they took part in the Labour Day parade on the day Vietnam was liberated.
That's why the baby carriages must be counted.
We all forgot the number 60.
Those 24 baby carriages gave the parade its historical dimension.
It wasn't enough for Nina that we helped drive the US out of Vietnam.
She wanted to go further.
And that only made me miss her more.
Comrades.
The class composition in the Party isn't good enough.
Too many intellectuals aren't fully employing their powers.
Those familiar with Communist theory have a collective responsibility.
Take your shoes off so we won't have to wash up after.
That means that people in petit bourgeois professions should consider doing something else.
Or the Party's thinking will become petit bourgeois too.
I urge you to consider making a complete break and becoming full-fledged members of the working class.
I have decided to become a worker.
I will no longer be a doctor.
I can't stand not being a part of the working class.
I have committed myself fully to the working class.
And for that reason I myself am becoming a worker.
I am going to start working at Brynje clothing factory.
These are the steam irons.
Where incidentally the King's gala uniform has been pressed...
Here are cuffs and sleeves for the King's guard...
As you can see, we're making uniforms now.
This is your station.
- I'll fetch Gerd.
- Thank you.
Hi.
Unni Langmoen would come to play a significant role in Nina's life.
Her burning political engagement was clear from the start.
So many awful things in the world...
And despite the proletarians' scepticism -
- Nina Skåtøy became the key player on the factory team.
It became clear that a new Comrade would have to make the brave leap.
But who would it be?
We need more Communists in the proleta...
Studying to become an engineer was a huge mistake.
Just a petit bourgeois dream.
I feel like a traitor, and a bloody awful Communist.
So I'm relieved to have made the decision to abandon my studies and return here.
Here, where I belong.
Werner got a job at the power station.
He began by asking polite questions, then making polite demands.
Why doesn't the union negotiate the wages for everyone here?
Werner Ludal turned out to be a very crafty Communist.
- Does the union negotiate for you?
- I do it myself.
Isn't it odd that those who've worked here the longest, are still in the lowest wage bracket?
Nina and Werner had become examples to us all.
Tove, hi.
We have a special offer on The Class Struggle this month.
Want to try it?
Hi, Malin.
It bothered me that Nina quit as a doctor.
But I admired her tenacity.
My relationship with Nina is strictly business now.
Anyway Jan Klåstad is better suited than I am.
A real proletarian.
A less complicated personality.
- No inner conflict.
- He doesn't have your inner conflict.
Why not join the working class?
No.
I'm a teacher.
I'm still attached to being a teacher.
You know?
It's good that we can talk about these things.
I'm not forgetting that we're revolutionaries.
In Nina's absence, it was good to have a friend.
But I still missed her.
Me and factory life, it's like...
I don't think we go together.
That has nothing to do with it.
In a few years you'll be a real worker yourself.
As a teacher, you can't contribute to the Revolution.
I think I could make some contributions.
Such as what?
I told the central committee about your inner conflict.
Must be awful.
A permanent conflict that one day might tear you apart.
You've been part of our movement for five years.
Isn't it about time you delivered on some of the promises you've made?
Don't you feel like a hypocrite, asking intellectuals to show solidarity with the working class?
Yes, but that doesn't mean I should start working in a factory.
Then get a job as a postman.
You'd be good at that.
Use your intellect to find unknown addresses.
I had become a second-class member.
There was no denying it.
Do it now!
Yes!
Comrades!
Seize the power!
Seize the power!
Sign here.
What am I signing?
You've been chosen as spokesman for AKP (m-l) Larvik.
And there.
"As World War III approaches, people must prepare for a long occupation."
"We admit the most likely occupier of our land is the Soviet Union."
Good.
Well written, Pedersen.
Thank you.
"A People's War against the occupier is our only way to freedom."
"Most of us will be tortured before we die."
Is this serious, Pedersen?
I suppose I got a bit carried away, but...
"Most of us will be tortured before we die"?
Dear, dear...
There's the house I was telling you about.
It's great up there.
An old mountain farm.
- Is that your son?
- Yes.
They live up north now.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
I prefer to trust my memory.
As the Third World War approaches, we need to tighten our security.
VACATION IN THE CANARY ISLANDS
All traces of political affiliation had to be removed before the War.
- Is it over between you and Jan?
- Yes.
If we're not back at work by Monday, management says they'll fire us.
There is no reason to doubt them.
Now I hear that some of you want to go back to work.
Some are losing their taste for the battle.
Even if it means we don't get... the parity bonus.
The strike was clearly a major defeat.
But Nina's spirit didn't break.
However, we had even tougher times in store.
With Mao's death, we registered the collapse of the Chinese utopia.
As you can see, -
- I'm now a social worker for the county.
Shouldn't you have presented this problem for collective discussion?
Cleaning for eight hours a day makes me irritable and aggressive.
And when I'm home I'm too tired to do anything.
I need a job where I'm not too tired to clean my own house.
What about the leading role of the working class?
I've applied to be a teacher again.
They've promised me my old job back at the school.
I get nothing out of my life at the bottling factory.
Don't you realize the huge responsibilities we've assumed?
As Marxist-Leninists we have a responsibility toward the workers and the oppressed in all countries.
- Isn't that Crown Prince Harald?
- He's so handsome.
- And so tan.
- Fantastic.
- Where is he?
- Houston, Texas.
For the first time since I met her, I felt she needed me.
More than ever, I wanted to be her knight in shining armour.
When she says "So many awful things in the world," it means something.
- Who said that?
- Unni Langmoen.
At the factory.
A woman in capitalist Larvik, in wealthy Norway, is afraid.
We mustn't forget that.
Maybe she just meant we're too well off in Norway?
She must think we're very well off here.
Perhaps she only said it to avoid more unpleasant questions?
- What I think Nina means is...
- I can speak for myself, Knut.
Suppose Unni had just said the world was a good place to live.
Suppose oppression had gone that far.
That's a starting point.
It's the basis for political activity.
For forming a front with the workers, against those who have created this world Unni dislikes.
You should read these.
- Even if you do work in a factory.
- Werner has quit.
Didn't tell anyone.
Gone off and become a Social Democrat.
Werner!
Werner!
Get out here!
Oh, it's you, is it?
- Is it true?
- Yes.
Yes, it is.
I realised I'm actually very happy about what's happened in Norway over the last century.
Imagine:
We were going to start an armed Revolution.
We were ready to gun people down.
Just the thought of it makes me shiver.
Thank goodness things turned out the way they did.
OK, right...
I understand.
You know what?
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid of ending up like you, Werner.
I'm making dinner, so...
It's bad enough to have a Social Democratic body, let alone brain!
- Go, just go.
- Yes.
Go on, eat your sausages or whatever...
It's not easy for Crown Princess Sonja, poor thing.
And she's so beautiful.
And intelligent, too.
And two adorable kids as well.
Thank God they're fit and healthy.
I read little princess Maud has a cold.
Martha Louise.
You're just trying to be funny.
- No, it was a mistake.
- You know her name is Martha Louise!
Of course I know Martha Louise is called Martha Louise.
I'm not stupid.
Don't pretend you don't know her name.
You're not that stupid?
No, I'm not that stupid.
This place has become unbearable!
Stop spoiling our lunch breaks, or we'll strike until they sack you.
- I want to go out.
- Can't we?
Just for one glass?
That must be little Maud.
I'm sorry.
I want to apologise for behaving so stupidly.
It won't happen again.
So you're sorry now?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
- So let's go out, then.
- Yes.
Hi.
Come in.
- I'm not intruding?
- I'm just washing up.
I wondered if I could interview you.
For the "Everyday Hero" column.
I thought of you.
I'm the official spokesman, you know.
Yes.
Want a beer?
Sure, if you've got one.
- Here.
- Thanks.
Pretty standard questions.
You know the type.
Do you feel accepted at the factory?
No.
I couldn't exactly say I've been accepted.
Why not?
It's my own fault, I suppose.
Do you think the situation will change?
Yes, of course I do, or else I would have quit.
How do you think it will change?
If I become like them.
And miss no opportunity to make it clear that that is what I really want.
Why do you want that?
I want to become as one with the doubly oppressed working-class woman.
To learn from them and become like them.
I like that.
Have you achieved much?
Not much.
But I learn something new every day, so...
At least I'm getting wiser.
Do you like your work?
Yes.
It can be somewhat tedious, but that's the lot of women.
- Are you staying there for good?
- Yes.
Unless there are any major social upheavals like war or occupation.
One final question:
Are you happy?
They always end with a personal question.
Are you happy?
No one's ever asked me that before.
Are you sending that to The Class Struggle?
Yes, or The Red Flag, or...
No, I'm not.
Perhaps you want to be alone?
I think perhaps I do.
Happy 30th birthday, Nina.
Thank you.
That's good, Nina!
Defence, Nina.
Run!
Defence!
Good!
Good match today.
Knut?
Will you come to Unni Langmoen's with me?
She used to work at the factory, but she got married.
I was confused.
I understood she wanted to show me something.
Now?
But I didn't know what it was.
Here's from the Christmas party.
I wish now I had understood.
Look at Gerd, she looks fed up.
- Nothing changes up there.
- And there's Grete...
Oh, I noticed your subscription to The Class Struggle has lapsed.
- It's so expensive.
- It is a bit expensive, yes.
But we have a number of special offers.
If that's of interest.
- But we never read it.
- No.
I understand.
I won't force a paper on you that you don't like.
It isn't that.
- There's so much heavy stuff in it.
- Yes, it's pretty heavy.
So you probably won't be renewing your subscription?
No.
In five years at the factory, Unni Langmoen was the only one I got to subscribe to The Class Struggle.
You can get another job.
Be a doctor again.
You have to do something.
You can't carry on at the factory.
Want to come up for a cup of tea?
For ten years, it seemed my life had been filled with meaning.
But I am very sceptical of the tool I dedicated ten years of my life to.
So watch out for those Communist Parties.
You look a bit scared.
But in spite of this I feel jubilant inside, having told you all this.
Perhaps I haven't made that too clear.
Perhaps it doesn't matter that much, either.
You know, we could start over, Nina.
You don't understand anything, do you?
Why don't you please come up for a little cup of tea?
You don't understand anything.
You understand everything.

COMRADE PEDERSEN
Good morning.
There is a widespread assumption that the world is progressing.
You are, as far as I can see, evidence of the opposite.
As everyone knows, Norway is one of the richest countries in the world.
So it's perhaps a little strange to think that a political movement started in this country around 1970 that attracted hordes of eager students and young intellectuals, inspired by a peasant's son from China.
And they decided to mobilise the people against the state.
And overthrow it through an armed revolution.
It's true.
That movement was called AKP (m-l).
Thousands joined the movement, including myself, a few years later.
The movement was clearer, colder, more cynically calculating here than in any other country.
With giant China as its ideological ideal.
For me it all started when I moved to Larvik in the '60s to teach.
I don't remember the year.
But I do remember the hemlines.
The future seemed open to me.
I could take what I wanted from life.
You have to gain her confidence.
Show her the holes in your socks.
That makes a strong impression.
It's disgusting, but you've no choice.
See, that's the only thing that makes you interesting.
Show how helpless you are.
Cultivate your weak sides, never your strong.
And most important, do it in the presence of others.
- I should make a fool of myself?
- Exactly!
That sure went well, Pedersen.
Unlike Gunnar, I didn't just want a woman.
I wanted marriage.
Children.
At the ripe old age of 28, I had a desperate desire to settle down.
I wanted to walk with my child on a tricycle beside me.
And he'd look up and say, "Daddy?"
And I'd say, "Yes?
What is it now?"
LIBRARY
It's about the cultural climate of German composer Arnold Sch?
nberg.
I can warm you up.
If you...
If you want.
What are you reading?
Celine.
Journey to the End of the Night.
Is it good?
I have to admit that I spied on her on occasion.
But not out of wickedness.
Only out of curiosity.
Domestically, happiness had reached new heights.
But outside Larvik city limits things were very different.
High standard?
What the hell is this high standard?
High standard.
What the hell is high standard?
Why you want a car and a house when guilt is consuming you?
How can you be so smug...
- 1814.
What happened?
- The Constitution.
And in 1821, the Aristocracy Law.
Pedersen?
Werner?
Do you know what my great-grandfather voted in 1851?
No?
He didn't vote.
Do you know why not, Pedersen?
He wasn't entitled to.
You can't judge the past by the standards of the present.
Maybe not, but we need to look at the way you teach history.
This classroom has an authoritarian structure.
Makes it hard to have a proper conversation.
- You think I'm too authoritarian?
- No, you're not.
We like you.
But this classroom is too restrictive.
We're sitting in line here.
It's very military.
You're up there, we're down here.
We can get more out of you.
Can I just show you one idea?
Say no if you think it's too much.
If we just move the desks.
Break up the structure a bit.
Isn't that a lot freer?
There is a reason for my standing up here.
If we learn more the higher up you stand, you should be squashed up under the ceiling.
If everyone pushes their desks against the wall...
Don't get up, Pedersen.
Tell me, why were the pupils sitting on the floor during class?
Did you sing?
No.
I didn't even know the song, so...
No, but perhaps it had a catchy refrain?
I won't deny that, but...
No, I did not sing.
It's easy to join in a song, if the refrain is catchy.
I agree.
But no.
No, I did not sing.
But it's so easy.
Your lips begin to move, your throat fills...
No.
I just stood there.
I didn't even sing inside.
Did you really stand up?
Yes, I really stood up.
But I'm not one of them.
I had to be polite.
That's what this is about.
I was being courteous.
You realize you must apologize to the parents?
I can only apologize that there is nothing to apologize for.
Obviously China is an example to be followed.
- The people have taken power there.
- China is an interesting case.
But don't forget, China is an ancient culture.
This is not about history.
It's about the class struggle.
In China the people have taken power.
Well, teacher...
I don't suppose you noticed milk went up 15 øre last week?
My meeting with the worker Jan Klåstad fostered a dramatic expectation of what the future held in store.
- My God!
I'm dangerous.
- Yes, you are.
The intellectual petite bourgeoisie has the power to influence others' views and actions.
The question is, who will you serve?
Now, under capitalism, and later, under real socialism?
So what you're asking is, will I serve the working class?
You won't be free until you're on our side.
Then there's the paper...
You got any change?
- It's not that important.
- How much do you need?
One, two, three, four...
Hi.
Most typical of AKP (m-l), was its security policy.
The meetings were top secret.
Obviously, these security precautions were very time-consuming.
Comrades!
Who was the Soviet State industrialised for?
Who were all these sacrifices made for?
For the people.
The people.
Boldly, I went out into the world to serve the people.
Although I struggled with my working class accent for years.
The Class Struggle!
Unite!
Everyone now!
Power to the people!
One leader!
The Class Struggle!
One people, one state!
Power to the people!
Unite!
Stand together!
The Class Struggle.
The Class Struggle.
The Class Struggle?
The Class...
My life has changed.
I have become utterly consumed by these fantastic visions.
Thanks to the good grades I, among others, gave him -
- Werner went off to study engineering in Trondheim.
I'll miss our conversations.
- Goodbye, Werner.
- Goodbye, Comrade.
But I sure didn't miss him for long.
A new Comrade was arriving.
Going out this late?
Yes.
A meeting at school.
Don't wait up.
That sick teacher simply refuses to get any better.
See you later.
I'm from the bourgeoisie.
My father is a professor of medicine.
Like him, I am also a doctor.
I grew up in a wealthy part of Oslo.
My parents let me develop freely.
And I've been subjected to very little oppression at home.
But when I joined the Communist Party to create a socialist Norway, their tolerance ran out.
I broke with my parents.
I have served the people for four years now.
Finally, I must point out my weaknesses as a Communist.
I don't anticipate the Revolution with any joy.
I work for it day and night, but I carry an inner fear of the revolutionary moment and the upheaval it will bring about.
Does your fear stem from your bourgeois upbringing?
No.
It's a weakness, but not specifically bourgeois.
I think the working class also fears the bloody consequences.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.
We don't think like that.
The bourgeoisie has tried to pump that fear into us for generations.
It is only natural to fear a revolution.
Every normal person fears bloodshed.
Nonetheless, fear can impede political activity.
So it is my duty to mention it.
In this world nothing is impossible as long as the people dare rise up.
- What do you think of Stalin?
- I love Stalin.
You love Stalin?
What do you love about him?
His personality?
His actions?
Perhaps a cheeky combination of both?
I just think we should make a clear distinction between some fluffy bunny and Stalin.
He was a lunatic.
I'm glad the bastard has been dead for 20 years.
We don't always need to praise someone just because...
Obviously he was a competent man...
in his own field... in his own way.
Bye.
There you go.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I bought a... record today.
The Sawmill Songs.
The new record by Homespun.
Want to come home with me and listen to it?
I agreed to, in spite of my limited musical knowledge.
Oh, Comrade!
Thank you.
I'm a crack marksman.
Bet you didn't know that.
I have to go home now.
- Hi.
- That took longer than expected.
Had a good day?
Yes.
Gunnar's a weird bloke.
What are you reading?
One Hundred Years of Solitude.
A lot of hard-core pornography is circulating in the workplace.
The working class is being tricked into spending loads of money on it.
That's a fuckin' lie.
There may be porn inside the factory gates.
Specially on the night shift.
It gets passed round and they all snigger.
But that is on the outside.
Inside they feel degraded by looking at naked women with shaven pussies.
Comrade Balder...
Tolfsen!
Shaven pussies.
Academics.
Proles...
Proletarians.
Workers...
Workers.
Library.
Shaven pussies.
Comrade...
Hi.
I've joined the Party.
And I thought you were being unfaithful...
BONJOUR TRISTESSE
We recruit.
We use cover names.
And you can't reveal your cover name?
- No.
Or I'd have to hurt you.
- Lf I guessed it?
- I don't know.
- Hurt?
You mean liquidate?
Maybe.
- Ivan?
Igor?
- No.
Red Fox?
- Am I getting warm?
- No, you're way off.
Compose yourself, Pedersen.
- Suppose I think they're right?
- Take a look around you!
- An armed revolution?
- Yes.
- Here?
- Yes.
Jesus Christ...
It's not that I'm stupid.
The Revolution isn't right round the corner.
But capitalism won't last forever.
Who will be there when it disappears?
Do you think capitalism will last forever?
No.
You don't believe that.
You're not that stupid!
How can you even entertain such a thought?
Come on!
It'll be great fun.
Armed revolution!
For the first time in my life I began to skip school.
What seems to be your problem?
No, but listen:
Why do people think they always have to have real things?
Plastic!
It's practical, useful and cheap.
That's why it's beautiful.
I've got plastic flowers at home.
They don't wilt.
Perfect for the active Communist.
In a funny way they look real.
Even more real than real flowers.
Sometimes they get this velvety layer.
So my mum gives them a wipe when she's cleaning, and they come up like new.
Plastic is beautiful.
Give me the pure and the proud
Those with patience and courage
And willpower to spare
Give me those who never will betray our great ideals...
Envelope nr 1:
"Go to the ferry landing in Horten."
"Take the ferry to Moss."
"Drive to Askim railway station."
So it's Østfold county again this year.
Østfold is nice.
SWEDISH BORDER 4 KM
"Cross the border.
Wait at Karlstad Hotel."
Brilliant!
Who would expect Vestfold AKP to have their annual meeting abroad?
That wasn't so bad.
It's no good.
It's too cold.
In this world nothing is impossible, as long as the people dare rise up.
She blasphemed, tenderly, in my ear.
And she was right.
In this world, nothing is impossible.
Chairman Mao would have liked this.
The first item on the agenda:
What constitutes the primary conflict in the world today?
Yes, Comrade Hilde?
I have had a clandestine affair with a married male Comrade.
I request the floor for self-criticism.
Shouldn't we rather discuss issues of national importance?
Sort those petit bourgeois things out for yourself.
I have had a decadent relationship with Comrade Eivind.
We have committed adultery.
A woman of the people has been hurt.
Eivind's wife.
We used the Party to keep it secret, so I have to ask:
What kind of Party do we want?
This is not some private matter!
It's a matter of life and death for the Party.
It's reactionary to tolerate a relationship like this.
What use is a Party that does nothing when I betray a woman of the people?
I don't need a Party like that.
A Party like that can never lead the people in their uprising.
I stand here because I don't want to rot.
I can't stand becoming a capitalist destiny.
That's why I became a Communist and joined this Party.
Do something!
Exterminate me if necessary, or give me a final warning.
But show that you mean it when you say that this Party will lead the people in the battle against all oppressors everywhere.
Thank you.
I, too, offer self-criticism.
But more as a matter of principle.
I don't regret what I've done.
I had a wonderful time.
The relationship's secret nature definitely made it more exciting.
I understand it's a breach of Party guidelines.
I accept that.
But I have been incredibly happy with Comrade Hilde.
Thank you.

The District Council issued a warning for breach of Party Regulations paragraph 12, section 1.
Quite a serious matter.
Hi.
I don't think anyone noticed that my personal life was in ruins.
I think you should go back to your marriage.
And stay there.
Do you still love me a little?
Next.
Hi.
- It's raining.
- Yes.
Thanks.
The mention of her name is enough to...
I cry out inside, and...
I don't know what's wrong with me.
Her smell, and...
It's like an explosion inside me.
I've never loved anyone as much as her.
Her voice when she says my name.
And "Comrade."
Comrade...
That was stupid of you.
- Yes.
- Yes.
So there's no chance of?
- No.
- No.
- Good night.
- Good night.
You can stay here for the time being.
I hope you'll like it.
What now began was the golden age of AKP (m-l).
I loved Nina more than ever.
But my plan was to act normal.
Well, Nina, here we are again.
Bright-eyed and bushy tailed.
Nina?
I wonder how the workers coped without us?
Must have been a sad state of affairs without us.
The belief that we would get back together was definitely there.
Only the girls are to sing the melody here, but some of the lads come in and ruin it.
Come on, Comrades.
Let's get started.
Harald, have you been to Ferdinand's Pub recently?
Yes, last Friday.
- Was it fun?
- Yes, it was OK.
- What did you do?
- Drank a few beers.
How many?
Three, perhaps?
- That's 42 kroner.
- Yes.
- Go there often?
- Maybe once a week.
And drink three beers?
Stop it, Nina.
A man's allowed to drink a couple of beers.
I'm just pointing out that it costs 42 kroner a week.
Money that the Party could put to good use.
- Why do you go to Ferdinand's?
- To have a good time.
Meet people.
Couldn't you drink coffee?
Give me a break!
You expect me to drink coffee when everyone else is drinking beer?
Yes.
Lots of people do.
Those who are driving, for example.
If you must drink, do it at home.
With your friends at home.
That alone would mean an extra 20 kroner for the Party.
You can still go to Ferdinand's for one beer.
Sip it, make it last.
Is that such a bad idea?
Anyway, after the Revolution, everyone will drink tea.
Hi...
- Hi.
- Hi.
Are you seeing Jan Klåstad now?
Answer me!
- The man is an animal.
- Knut!
I knew it was bourgeois of me to be jealous, especially of a worker.
Knut...
Sure you don't want to come with us?
- Are you getting tired?
- Yes.
Do you want to go to mummy?
What have you got there?
We'll see each other just as often, even though you're moving a thousand miles away.
Knut!
Knut!
The USA has been driven out by the Vietnamese!
I knew it was only a political embrace.
But I took what little I could get.
There must be more than this.
Have you seen Anna Nicolaysen and her husband?
They promised to come!
Damn!
- I don't see Marit Knutsen either.
- Come on, let's line up.
How many are we?
Sixty.
Count the baby carriages, too.
Don't forget.
And count all the wheels.
NATO out of Norway!
USA out of Cambodia!
You shouldn't joke about the baby carriages.
Those babies aren't here of their own free will.
It would be an insult not to count them.
Imagine the pride, knowing they took part in the Labour Day parade on the day Vietnam was liberated.
That's why the baby carriages must be counted.
We all forgot the number 60.
Those 24 baby carriages gave the parade its historical dimension.
It wasn't enough for Nina that we helped drive the US out of Vietnam.
She wanted to go further.
And that only made me miss her more.
Comrades.
The class composition in the Party isn't good enough.
Too many intellectuals aren't fully employing their powers.
Those familiar with Communist theory have a collective responsibility.
Take your shoes off so we won't have to wash up after.
That means that people in petit bourgeois professions should consider doing something else.
Or the Party's thinking will become petit bourgeois too.
I urge you to consider making a complete break and becoming full-fledged members of the working class.
I have decided to become a worker.
I will no longer be a doctor.
I can't stand not being a part of the working class.
I have committed myself fully to the working class.
And for that reason I myself am becoming a worker.
I am going to start working at Brynje clothing factory.
These are the steam irons.
Where incidentally the King's gala uniform has been pressed...
Here are cuffs and sleeves for the King's guard...
As you can see, we're making uniforms now.
This is your station.
- I'll fetch Gerd.
- Thank you.
Hi.
Unni Langmoen would come to play a significant role in Nina's life.
Her burning political engagement was clear from the start.
So many awful things in the world...
And despite the proletarians' scepticism -
- Nina Skåtøy became the key player on the factory team.
It became clear that a new Comrade would have to make the brave leap.
But who would it be?
We need more Communists in the proleta...
Studying to become an engineer was a huge mistake.
Just a petit bourgeois dream.
I feel like a traitor, and a bloody awful Communist.
So I'm relieved to have made the decision to abandon my studies and return here.
Here, where I belong.
Werner got a job at the power station.
He began by asking polite questions, then making polite demands.
Why doesn't the union negotiate the wages for everyone here?
Werner Ludal turned out to be a very crafty Communist.
- Does the union negotiate for you?
- I do it myself.
Isn't it odd that those who've worked here the longest, are still in the lowest wage bracket?
Nina and Werner had become examples to us all.
Tove, hi.
We have a special offer on The Class Struggle this month.
Want to try it?
Hi, Malin.
It bothered me that Nina quit as a doctor.
But I admired her tenacity.
My relationship with Nina is strictly business now.
Anyway Jan Klåstad is better suited than I am.
A real proletarian.
A less complicated personality.
- No inner conflict.
- He doesn't have your inner conflict.
Why not join the working class?
No.
I'm a teacher.
I'm still attached to being a teacher.
You know?
It's good that we can talk about these things.
I'm not forgetting that we're revolutionaries.
In Nina's absence, it was good to have a friend.
But I still missed her.
Me and factory life, it's like...
I don't think we go together.
That has nothing to do with it.
In a few years you'll be a real worker yourself.
As a teacher, you can't contribute to the Revolution.
I think I could make some contributions.
Such as what?
I told the central committee about your inner conflict.
Must be awful.
A permanent conflict that one day might tear you apart.
You've been part of our movement for five years.
Isn't it about time you delivered on some of the promises you've made?
Don't you feel like a hypocrite, asking intellectuals to show solidarity with the working class?
Yes, but that doesn't mean I should start working in a factory.
Then get a job as a postman.
You'd be good at that.
Use your intellect to find unknown addresses.
I had become a second-class member.
There was no denying it.
Do it now!
Yes!
Comrades!
Seize the power!
Seize the power!
Sign here.
What am I signing?
You've been chosen as spokesman for AKP (m-l) Larvik.
And there.
"As World War III approaches, people must prepare for a long occupation."
"We admit the most likely occupier of our land is the Soviet Union."
Good.
Well written, Pedersen.
Thank you.
"A People's War against the occupier is our only way to freedom."
"Most of us will be tortured before we die."
Is this serious, Pedersen?
I suppose I got a bit carried away, but...
"Most of us will be tortured before we die"?
Dear, dear...
There's the house I was telling you about.
It's great up there.
An old mountain farm.
- Is that your son?
- Yes.
They live up north now.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
I prefer to trust my memory.
As the Third World War approaches, we need to tighten our security.
VACATION IN THE CANARY ISLANDS
All traces of political affiliation had to be removed before the War.
- Is it over between you and Jan?
- Yes.
If we're not back at work by Monday, management says they'll fire us.
There is no reason to doubt them.
Now I hear that some of you want to go back to work.
Some are losing their taste for the battle.
Even if it means we don't get... the parity bonus.
The strike was clearly a major defeat.
But Nina's spirit didn't break.
However, we had even tougher times in store.
With Mao's death, we registered the collapse of the Chinese utopia.
As you can see, -
- I'm now a social worker for the county.
Shouldn't you have presented this problem for collective discussion?
Cleaning for eight hours a day makes me irritable and aggressive.
And when I'm home I'm too tired to do anything.
I need a job where I'm not too tired to clean my own house.
What about the leading role of the working class?
I've applied to be a teacher again.
They've promised me my old job back at the school.
I get nothing out of my life at the bottling factory.
Don't you realize the huge responsibilities we've assumed?
As Marxist-Leninists we have a responsibility toward the workers and the oppressed in all countries.
- Isn't that Crown Prince Harald?
- He's so handsome.
- And so tan.
- Fantastic.
- Where is he?
- Houston, Texas.
For the first time since I met her, I felt she needed me.
More than ever, I wanted to be her knight in shining armour.
When she says "So many awful things in the world," it means something.
- Who said that?
- Unni Langmoen.
At the factory.
A woman in capitalist Larvik, in wealthy Norway, is afraid.
We mustn't forget that.
Maybe she just meant we're too well off in Norway?
She must think we're very well off here.
Perhaps she only said it to avoid more unpleasant questions?
- What I think Nina means is...
- I can speak for myself, Knut.
Suppose Unni had just said the world was a good place to live.
Suppose oppression had gone that far.
That's a starting point.
It's the basis for political activity.
For forming a front with the workers, against those who have created this world Unni dislikes.
You should read these.
- Even if you do work in a factory.
- Werner has quit.
Didn't tell anyone.
Gone off and become a Social Democrat.
Werner!
Werner!
Get out here!
Oh, it's you, is it?
- Is it true?
- Yes.
Yes, it is.
I realised I'm actually very happy about what's happened in Norway over the last century.
Imagine:
We were going to start an armed Revolution.
We were ready to gun people down.
Just the thought of it makes me shiver.
Thank goodness things turned out the way they did.
OK, right...
I understand.
You know what?
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid of ending up like you, Werner.
I'm making dinner, so...
It's bad enough to have a Social Democratic body, let alone brain!
- Go, just go.
- Yes.
Go on, eat your sausages or whatever...
It's not easy for Crown Princess Sonja, poor thing.
And she's so beautiful.
And intelligent, too.
And two adorable kids as well.
Thank God they're fit and healthy.
I read little princess Maud has a cold.
Martha Louise.
You're just trying to be funny.
- No, it was a mistake.
- You know her name is Martha Louise!
Of course I know Martha Louise is called Martha Louise.
I'm not stupid.
Don't pretend you don't know her name.
You're not that stupid?
No, I'm not that stupid.
This place has become unbearable!
Stop spoiling our lunch breaks, or we'll strike until they sack you.
- I want to go out.
- Can't we?
Just for one glass?
That must be little Maud.
I'm sorry.
I want to apologise for behaving so stupidly.
It won't happen again.
So you're sorry now?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
- So let's go out, then.
- Yes.
Hi.
Come in.
- I'm not intruding?
- I'm just washing up.
I wondered if I could interview you.
For the "Everyday Hero" column.
I thought of you.
I'm the official spokesman, you know.
Yes.
Want a beer?
Sure, if you've got one.
- Here.
- Thanks.
Pretty standard questions.
You know the type.
Do you feel accepted at the factory?
No.
I couldn't exactly say I've been accepted.
Why not?
It's my own fault, I suppose.
Do you think the situation will change?
Yes, of course I do, or else I would have quit.
How do you think it will change?
If I become like them.
And miss no opportunity to make it clear that that is what I really want.
Why do you want that?
I want to become as one with the doubly oppressed working-class woman.
To learn from them and become like them.
I like that.
Have you achieved much?
Not much.
But I learn something new every day, so...
At least I'm getting wiser.
Do you like your work?
Yes.
It can be somewhat tedious, but that's the lot of women.
- Are you staying there for good?
- Yes.
Unless there are any major social upheavals like war or occupation.
One final question:
Are you happy?
They always end with a personal question.
Are you happy?
No one's ever asked me that before.
Are you sending that to The Class Struggle?
Yes, or The Red Flag, or...
No, I'm not.
Perhaps you want to be alone?
I think perhaps I do.
Happy 30th birthday, Nina.
Thank you.
That's good, Nina!
Defence, Nina.
Run!
Defence!
Good!
Good match today.
Knut?
Will you come to Unni Langmoen's with me?
She used to work at the factory, but she got married.
I was confused.
I understood she wanted to show me something.
Now?
But I didn't know what it was.
Here's from the Christmas party.
I wish now I had understood.
Look at Gerd, she looks fed up.
- Nothing changes up there.
- And there's Grete...
Oh, I noticed your subscription to The Class Struggle has lapsed.
- It's so expensive.
- It is a bit expensive, yes.
But we have a number of special offers.
If that's of interest.
- But we never read it.
- No.
I understand.
I won't force a paper on you that you don't like.
It isn't that.
- There's so much heavy stuff in it.
- Yes, it's pretty heavy.
So you probably won't be renewing your subscription?
No.
In five years at the factory, Unni Langmoen was the only one I got to subscribe to The Class Struggle.
You can get another job.
Be a doctor again.
You have to do something.
You can't carry on at the factory.
Want to come up for a cup of tea?
For ten years, it seemed my life had been filled with meaning.
But I am very sceptical of the tool I dedicated ten years of my life to.
So watch out for those Communist Parties.
You look a bit scared.
But in spite of this I feel jubilant inside, having told you all this.
Perhaps I haven't made that too clear.
Perhaps it doesn't matter that much, either.
You know, we could start over, Nina.
You don't understand anything, do you?
Why don't you please come up for a little cup of tea?
You don't understand anything.
You understand everything.

COMRADE PEDERSEN
Good morning.
There is a widespread assumption that the world is progressing.
You are, as far as I can see, evidence of the opposite.
As everyone knows, Norway is one of the richest countries in the world.
So it's perhaps a little strange to think that a political movement started in this country around 1970 that attracted hordes of eager students and young intellectuals, inspired by a peasant's son from China.
And they decided to mobilise the people against the state.
And overthrow it through an armed revolution.
It's true.
That movement was called AKP (m-l).
Thousands joined the movement, including myself, a few years later.
The movement was clearer, colder, more cynically calculating here than in any other country.
With giant China as its ideological ideal.
For me it all started when I moved to Larvik in the '60s to teach.
I don't remember the year.
But I do remember the hemlines.
The future seemed open to me.
I could take what I wanted from life.
You have to gain her confidence.
Show her the holes in your socks.
That makes a strong impression.
It's disgusting, but you've no choice.
See, that's the only thing that makes you interesting.
Show how helpless you are.
Cultivate your weak sides, never your strong.
And most important, do it in the presence of others.
- I should make a fool of myself?
- Exactly!
That sure went well, Pedersen.
Unlike Gunnar, I didn't just want a woman.
I wanted marriage.
Children.
At the ripe old age of 28, I had a desperate desire to settle down.
I wanted to walk with my child on a tricycle beside me.
And he'd look up and say, "Daddy?"
And I'd say, "Yes?
What is it now?"
LIBRARY
It's about the cultural climate of German composer Arnold Sch^nberg.
I can warm you up.
If you...
If you want.
What are you reading?
Celine.
Journey to the End of the Night.
Is it good?
I have to admit that I spied on her on occasion.
But not out of wickedness.
Only out of curiosity.
Domestically, happiness had reached new heights.
But outside Larvik city limits things were very different.
High standard?
What the hell is this high standard?
High standard.
What the hell is high standard?
Why you want a car and a house when guilt is consuming you?
How can you be so smug...
- 1814.
What happened?
- The Constitution.
And in 1821, the Aristocracy Law.
Pedersen?
Werner?
Do you know what my great-grandfather voted in 1851?
No?
He didn't vote.
Do you know why not, Pedersen?
He wasn't entitled to.
You can't judge the past by the standards of the present.
Maybe not, but we need to look at the way you teach history.
This classroom has an authoritarian structure.
Makes it hard to have a proper conversation.
- You think I'm too authoritarian?
- No, you're not.
We like you.
But this classroom is too restrictive.
We're sitting in line here.
It's very military.
You're up there, we're down here.
We can get more out of you.
Can I just show you one idea?
Say no if you think it's too much.
If we just move the desks.
Break up the structure a bit.
Isn't that a lot freer?
There is a reason for my standing up here.
If we learn more the higher up you stand, you should be squashed up under the ceiling.
If everyone pushes their desks against the wall...
Don't get up, Pedersen.
Tell me, why were the pupils sitting on the floor during class?
Did you sing?
No.
I didn't even know the song, so...
No, but perhaps it had a catchy refrain?
I won't deny that, but...
No, I did not sing.
It's easy to join in a song, if the refrain is catchy.
I agree.
But no.
No, I did not sing.
But it's so easy.
Your lips begin to move, your throat fills...
No.
I just stood there.
I didn't even sing inside.
Did you really stand up?
Yes, I really stood up.
But I'm not one of them.
I had to be polite.
That's what this is about.
I was being courteous.
You realize you must apologize to the parents?
I can only apologize that there is nothing to apologize for.
Obviously China is an example to be followed.
- The people have taken power there.
- China is an interesting case.
But don't forget, China is an ancient culture.
This is not about history.
It's about the class struggle.
In China the people have taken power.
Well, teacher...
I don't suppose you noticed milk went up 15 øre last week?
My meeting with the worker Jan Klåstad fostered a dramatic expectation of what the future held in store.
- My God!
I'm dangerous.
- Yes, you are.
The intellectual petite bourgeoisie has the power to influence others' views and actions.
The question is, who will you serve?
Now, under capitalism, and later, under real socialism?
So what you're asking is, will I serve the working class?
You won't be free until you're on our side.
Then there's the paper...
You got any change?
- It's not that important.
- How much do you need?
One, two, three, four...
Hi.
Most typical of AKP (m-l), was its security policy.
The meetings were top secret.
Obviously, these security precautions were very time-consuming.
Comrades!
Who was the Soviet State industrialised for?
Who were all these sacrifices made for?
For the people.
The people.
Boldly, I went out into the world to serve the people.
Although I struggled with my working class accent for years.
The Class Struggle!
Unite!
Everyone now!
Power to the people!
One leader!
The Class Struggle!
One people, one state!
Power to the people!
Unite!
Stand together!
The Class Struggle.
The Class Struggle.
The Class Struggle?
The Class...
My life has changed.
I have become utterly consumed by these fantastic visions.
Thanks to the good grades I, among others, gave him -
- Werner went off to study engineering in Trondheim.
I'll miss our conversations.
- Goodbye, Werner.
- Goodbye, Comrade.
But I sure didn't miss him for long.
A new Comrade was arriving.
Going out this late?
Yes.
A meeting at school.
Don't wait up.
That sick teacher simply refuses to get any better.
See you later.
I'm from the bourgeoisie.
My father is a professor of medicine.
Like him, I am also a doctor.
I grew up in a wealthy part of Oslo.
My parents let me develop freely.
And I've been subjected to very little oppression at home.
But when I joined the Communist Party to create a socialist Norway, their tolerance ran out.
I broke with my parents.
I have served the people for four years now.
Finally, I must point out my weaknesses as a Communist.
I don't anticipate the Revolution with any joy.
I work for it day and night, but I carry an inner fear of the revolutionary moment and the upheaval it will bring about.
Does your fear stem from your bourgeois upbringing?
No.
It's a weakness, but not specifically bourgeois.
I think the working class also fears the bloody consequences.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.
We don't think like that.
The bourgeoisie has tried to pump that fear into us for generations.
It is only natural to fear a revolution.
Every normal person fears bloodshed.
Nonetheless, fear can impede political activity.
So it is my duty to mention it.
In this world nothing is impossible as long as the people dare rise up.
- What do you think of Stalin?
- I love Stalin.
You love Stalin?
What do you love about him?
His personality?
His actions?
Perhaps a cheeky combination of both?
I just think we should make a clear distinction between some fluffy bunny and Stalin.
He was a lunatic.
I'm glad the bastard has been dead for 20 years.
We don't always need to praise someone just because...
Obviously he was a competent man...
in his own field... in his own way.
Bye.
There you go.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I bought a... record today.
The Sawmill Songs.
The new record by Homespun.
Want to come home with me and listen to it?
I agreed to, in spite of my limited musical knowledge.
Oh, Comrade!
Thank you.
I'm a crack marksman.
Bet you didn't know that.
I have to go home now.
- Hi.
- That took longer than expected.
Had a good day?
Yes.
Gunnar's a weird bloke.
What are you reading?
One Hundred Years of Solitude.
A lot of hard-core pornography is circulating in the workplace.
The working class is being tricked into spending loads of money on it.
That's a fuckin' lie.
There may be porn inside the factory gates.
Specially on the night shift.
It gets passed round and they all snigger.
But that is on the outside.
Inside they feel degraded by looking at naked women with shaven pussies.
Comrade Balder...
Tolfsen!
Shaven pussies.
Academics.
Proles...
Proletarians.
Workers...
Workers.
Library.
Shaven pussies.
Comrade...
Hi.
I've joined the Party.
And I thought you were being unfaithful...
BONJOUR TRISTESSE
We recruit.
We use cover names.
And you can't reveal your cover name?
- No.
Or I'd have to hurt you.
- Lf I guessed it?
- I don't know.
- Hurt?
You mean liquidate?
Maybe.
- Ivan?
Igor?
- No.
Red Fox?
- Am I getting warm?
- No, you're way off.
Compose yourself, Pedersen.
- Suppose I think they're right?
- Take a look around you!
- An armed revolution?
- Yes.
- Here?
- Yes.
Jesus Christ...
It's not that I'm stupid.
The Revolution isn't right round the corner.
But capitalism won't last forever.
Who will be there when it disappears?
Do you think capitalism will last forever?
No.
You don't believe that.
You're not that stupid!
How can you even entertain such a thought?
Come on!
It'll be great fun.
Armed revolution!
For the first time in my life I began to skip school.
What seems to be your problem?
No, but listen:
Why do people think they always have to have real things?
Plastic!
It's practical, useful and cheap.
That's why it's beautiful.
I've got plastic flowers at home.
They don't wilt.
Perfect for the active Communist.
In a funny way they look real.
Even more real than real flowers.
Sometimes they get this velvety layer.
So my mum gives them a wipe when she's cleaning, and they come up like new.
Plastic is beautiful.
Give me the pure and the proud
Those with patience and courage
And willpower to spare
Give me those who never will betray our great ideals...
Envelope nr 1:
"Go to the ferry landing in Horten."
"Take the ferry to Moss."
"Drive to Askim railway station."
So it's Østfold county again this year.
Østfold is nice.
SWEDISH BORDER 4 KM
"Cross the border.
Wait at Karlstad Hotel."
Brilliant!
Who would expect Vestfold AKP to have their annual meeting abroad?
That wasn't so bad.
It's no good.
It's too cold.
In this world nothing is impossible, as long as the people dare rise up.
She blasphemed, tenderly, in my ear.
And she was right.
In this world, nothing is impossible.
Chairman Mao would have liked this.
The first item on the agenda:
What constitutes the primary conflict in the world today?
Yes, Comrade Hilde?
I have had a clandestine affair with a married male Comrade.
I request the floor for self-criticism.
Shouldn't we rather discuss issues of national importance?
Sort those petit bourgeois things out for yourself.
I have had a decadent relationship with Comrade Eivind.
We have committed adultery.
A woman of the people has been hurt.
Eivind's wife.
We used the Party to keep it secret, so I have to ask:
What kind of Party do we want?
This is not some private matter!
It's a matter of life and death for the Party.
It's reactionary to tolerate a relationship like this.
What use is a Party that does nothing when I betray a woman of the people?
I don't need a Party like that.
A Party like that can never lead the people in their uprising.
I stand here because I don't want to rot.
I can't stand becoming a capitalist destiny.
That's why I became a Communist and joined this Party.
Do something!
Exterminate me if necessary, or give me a final warning.
But show that you mean it when you say that this Party will lead the people in the battle against all oppressors everywhere.
Thank you.
I, too, offer self-criticism.
But more as a matter of principle.
I don't regret what I've done.
I had a wonderful time.
The relationship's secret nature definitely made it more exciting.
I understand it's a breach of Party guidelines.
I accept that.
But I have been incredibly happy with Comrade Hilde.
Thank you.
The District Council issued a warning for breach of Party Regulations paragraph 12, section 1.
Quite a serious matter.
Hi.
I don't think anyone noticed that my personal life was in ruins.
I think you should go back to your marriage.
And stay there.
Do you still love me a little?
Next.
Hi.
- It's raining.
- Yes.
Thanks.
The mention of her name is enough to...
I cry out inside, and...
I don't know what's wrong with me.
Her smell, and...
It's like an explosion inside me.
I've never loved anyone as much as her.
Her voice when she says my name.
And "Comrade."
Comrade...
That was stupid of you.
- Yes.
- Yes.
So there's no chance of?
- No.
- No.
- Good night.
- Good night.
You can stay here for the time being.
I hope you'll like it.
What now began was the golden age of AKP (m-l).
I loved Nina more than ever.
But my plan was to act normal.
Well, Nina, here we are again.
Bright-eyed and bushy tailed.
Nina?
I wonder how the workers coped without us?
Must have been a sad state of affairs without us.
The belief that we would get back together was definitely there.
Only the girls are to sing the melody here, but some of the lads come in and ruin it.
Come on, Comrades.
Let's get started.
Harald, have you been to Ferdinand's Pub recently?
Yes, last Friday.
- Was it fun?
- Yes, it was OK.
- What did you do?
- Drank a few beers.
How many?
Three, perhaps?
- That's 42 kroner.
- Yes.
- Go there often?
- Maybe once a week.
And drink three beers?
Stop it, Nina.
A man's allowed to drink a couple of beers.
I'm just pointing out that it costs 42 kroner a week.
Money that the Party could put to good use.
- Why do you go to Ferdinand's?
- To have a good time.
Meet people.
Couldn't you drink coffee?
Give me a break!
You expect me to drink coffee when everyone else is drinking beer?
Yes.
Lots of people do.
Those who are driving, for example.
If you must drink, do it at home.
With your friends at home.
That alone would mean an extra 20 kroner for the Party.
You can still go to Ferdinand's for one beer.
Sip it, make it last.
Is that such a bad idea?
Anyway, after the Revolution, everyone will drink tea.
Hi...
- Hi.
- Hi.
Are you seeing Jan Klåstad now?
Answer me!
- The man is an animal.
- Knut!
I knew it was bourgeois of me to be jealous, especially of a worker.
Knut...
Sure you don't want to come with us?
- Are you getting tired?
- Yes.
Do you want to go to mummy?
What have you got there?
We'll see each other just as often, even though you're moving a thousand miles away.
Knut!
Knut!
The USA has been driven out by the Vietnamese!
I knew it was only a political embrace.
But I took what little I could get.
There must be more than this.
Have you seen Anna Nicolaysen and her husband?
They promised to come!
Damn!
- I don't see Marit Knutsen either.
- Come on, let's line up.
How many are we?
Sixty.
Count the baby carriages, too.
Don't forget.
And count all the wheels.
NATO out of Norway!
USA out of Cambodia!
You shouldn't joke about the baby carriages.
Those babies aren't here of their own free will.
It would be an insult not to count them.
Imagine the pride, knowing they took part in the Labour Day parade on the day Vietnam was liberated.
That's why the baby carriages must be counted.
We all forgot the number 60.
Those 24 baby carriages gave the parade its historical dimension.
It wasn't enough for Nina that we helped drive the US out of Vietnam.
She wanted to go further.
And that only made me miss her more.
Comrades.
The class composition in the Party isn't good enough.
Too many intellectuals aren't fully employing their powers.
Those familiar with Communist theory have a collective responsibility.
Take your shoes off so we won't have to wash up after.
That means that people in petit bourgeois professions should consider doing something else.
Or the Party's thinking will become petit bourgeois too.
I urge you to consider making a complete break and becoming full-fledged members of the working class.
I have decided to become a worker.
I will no longer be a doctor.
I can't stand not being a part of the working class.
I have committed myself fully to the working class.
And for that reason I myself am becoming a worker.
I am going to start working at Brynje clothing factory.
These are the steam irons.
Where incidentally the King's gala uniform has been pressed...
Here are cuffs and sleeves for the King's guard...
As you can see, we're making uniforms now.
This is your station.
- I'll fetch Gerd.
- Thank you.
Hi.
Unni Langmoen would come to play a significant role in Nina's life.
Her burning political engagement was clear from the start.
So many awful things in the world...
And despite the proletarians' scepticism -
- Nina Skåtøy became the key player on the factory team.
It became clear that a new Comrade would have to make the brave leap.
But who would it be?
We need more Communists in the proleta...
Studying to become an engineer was a huge mistake.
Just a petit bourgeois dream.
I feel like a traitor, and a bloody awful Communist.
So I'm relieved to have made the decision to abandon my studies and return here.
Here, where I belong.
Werner got a job at the power station.
He began by asking polite questions, then making polite demands.
Why doesn't the union negotiate the wages for everyone here?
Werner Ludal turned out to be a very crafty Communist.
- Does the union negotiate for you?
- I do it myself.
Isn't it odd that those who've worked here the longest, are still in the lowest wage bracket?
Nina and Werner had become examples to us all.
Tove, hi.
We have a special offer on The Class Struggle this month.
Want to try it?
Hi, Malin.
It bothered me that Nina quit as a doctor.
But I admired her tenacity.
My relationship with Nina is strictly business now.
Anyway Jan Klåstad is better suited than I am.
A real proletarian.
A less complicated personality.
- No inner conflict.
- He doesn't have your inner conflict.
Why not join the working class?
No.
I'm a teacher.
I'm still attached to being a teacher.
You know?
It's good that we can talk about these things.
I'm not forgetting that we're revolutionaries.
In Nina's absence, it was good to have a friend.
But I still missed her.
Me and factory life, it's like...
I don't think we go together.
That has nothing to do with it.
In a few years you'll be a real worker yourself.
As a teacher, you can't contribute to the Revolution.
I think I could make some contributions.
Such as what?
I told the central committee about your inner conflict.
Must be awful.
A permanent conflict that one day might tear you apart.
You've been part of our movement for five years.
Isn't it about time you delivered on some of the promises you've made?
Don't you feel like a hypocrite, asking intellectuals to show solidarity with the working class?
Yes, but that doesn't mean I should start working in a factory.
Then get a job as a postman.
You'd be good at that.
Use your intellect to find unknown addresses.
I had become a second-class member.
There was no denying it.
Do it now!
Yes!
Comrades!
Seize the power!
Seize the power!
Sign here.
What am I signing?
You've been chosen as spokesman for AKP (m-l) Larvik.
And there.
"As World War III approaches, people must prepare for a long occupation."
"We admit the most likely occupier of our land is the Soviet Union."
Good.
Well written, Pedersen.
Thank you.
"A People's War against the occupier is our only way to freedom."
"Most of us will be tortured before we die."
Is this serious, Pedersen?
I suppose I got a bit carried away, but...
"Most of us will be tortured before we die"?
Dear, dear...
There's the house I was telling you about.
It's great up there.
An old mountain farm.
- Is that your son?
- Yes.
They live up north now.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
I prefer to trust my memory.
As the Third World War approaches, we need to tighten our security.
VACATION IN THE CANARY ISLANDS
All traces of political affiliation had to be removed before the War.
- Is it over between you and Jan?
- Yes.
If we're not back at work by Monday, management says they'll fire us.
There is no reason to doubt them.
Now I hear that some of you want to go back to work.
Some are losing their taste for the battle.
Even if it means we don't get... the parity bonus.
The strike was clearly a major defeat.
But Nina's spirit didn't break.
However, we had even tougher times in store.
With Mao's death, we registered the collapse of the Chinese utopia.
As you can see, -
- I'm now a social worker for the county.
Shouldn't you have presented this problem for collective discussion?
Cleaning for eight hours a day makes me irritable and aggressive.
And when I'm home I'm too tired to do anything.
I need a job where I'm not too tired to clean my own house.
What about the leading role of the working class?
I've applied to be a teacher again.
They've promised me my old job back at the school.
I get nothing out of my life at the bottling factory.
Don't you realize the huge responsibilities we've assumed?
As Marxist-Leninists we have a responsibility toward the workers and the oppressed in all countries.
- Isn't that Crown Prince Harald?
- He's so handsome.
- And so tan.
- Fantastic.
- Where is he?
- Houston, Texas.
For the first time since I met her, I felt she needed me.
More than ever, I wanted to be her knight in shining armour.
When she says "So many awful things in the world," it means something.
- Who said that?
- Unni Langmoen.
At the factory.
A woman in capitalist Larvik, in wealthy Norway, is afraid.
We mustn't forget that.
Maybe she just meant we're too well off in Norway?
She must think we're very well off here.
Perhaps she only said it to avoid more unpleasant questions?
- What I think Nina means is...
- I can speak for myself, Knut.
Suppose Unni had just said the world was a good place to live.
Suppose oppression had gone that far.
That's a starting point.
It's the basis for political activity.
For forming a front with the workers, against those who have created this world Unni dislikes.
You should read these.
- Even if you do work in a factory.
- Werner has quit.
Didn't tell anyone.
Gone off and become a Social Democrat.
Werner!
Werner!
Get out here!
Oh, it's you, is it?
- Is it true?
- Yes.
Yes, it is.
I realised I'm actually very happy about what's happened in Norway over the last century.
Imagine:
We were going to start an armed Revolution.
We were ready to gun people down.
Just the thought of it makes me shiver.
Thank goodness things turned out the way they did.
OK, right...
I understand.
You know what?
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid of ending up like you, Werner.
I'm making dinner, so...
It's bad enough to have a Social Democratic body, let alone brain!
- Go, just go.
- Yes.
Go on, eat your sausages or whatever...
It's not easy for Crown Princess Sonja, poor thing.
And she's so beautiful.
And intelligent, too.
And two adorable kids as well.
Thank God they're fit and healthy.
I read little princess Maud has a cold.
Martha Louise.
You're just trying to be funny.
- No, it was a mistake.
- You know her name is Martha Louise!
Of course I know Martha Louise is called Martha Louise.
I'm not stupid.
Don't pretend you don't know her name.
You're not that stupid?
No, I'm not that stupid.
This place has become unbearable!
Stop spoiling our lunch breaks, or we'll strike until they sack you.
- I want to go out.
- Can't we?
Just for one glass?
That must be little Maud.
I'm sorry.
I want to apologise for behaving so stupidly.
It won't happen again.
So you're sorry now?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
- So let's go out, then.
- Yes.
Hi.
Come in.
- I'm not intruding?
- I'm just washing up.
I wondered if I could interview you.
For the "Everyday Hero" column.
I thought of you.
I'm the official spokesman, you know.
Yes.
Want a beer?
Sure, if you've got one.
- Here.
- Thanks.
Pretty standard questions.
You know the type.
Do you feel accepted at the factory?
No.
I couldn't exactly say I've been accepted.
Why not?
It's my own fault, I suppose.
Do you think the situation will change?
Yes, of course I do, or else I would have quit.
How do you think it will change?
If I become like them.
And miss no opportunity to make it clear that that is what I really want.
Why do you want that?
I want to become as one with the doubly oppressed working-class woman.
To learn from them and become like them.
I like that.
Have you achieved much?
Not much.
But I learn something new every day, so...
At least I'm getting wiser.
Do you like your work?
Yes.
It can be somewhat tedious, but that's the lot of women.
- Are you staying there for good?
- Yes.
Unless there are any major social upheavals like war or occupation.
One final question:
Are you happy?
They always end with a personal question.
Are you happy?
No one's ever asked me that before.
Are you sending that to The Class Struggle?
Yes, or The Red Flag, or...
No, I'm not.
Perhaps you want to be alone?
I think perhaps I do.
Happy 30th birthday, Nina.
Thank you.
That's good, Nina!
Defence, Nina.
Run!
Defence!
Good!
Good match today.
Knut?
Will you come to Unni Langmoen's with me?
She used to work at the factory, but she got married.
I was confused.
I understood she wanted to show me something.
Now?
But I didn't know what it was.
Here's from the Christmas party.
I wish now I had understood.
Look at Gerd, she looks fed up.
- Nothing changes up there.
- And there's Grete...
Oh, I noticed your subscription to The Class Struggle has lapsed.
- It's so expensive.
- It is a bit expensive, yes.
But we have a number of special offers.
If that's of interest.
- But we never read it.
- No.
I understand.
I won't force a paper on you that you don't like.
It isn't that.
- There's so much heavy stuff in it.
- Yes, it's pretty heavy.
So you probably won't be renewing your subscription?
No.
In five years at the factory, Unni Langmoen was the only one I got to subscribe to The Class Struggle.
You can get another job.
Be a doctor again.
You have to do something.
You can't carry on at the factory.
Want to come up for a cup of tea?
For ten years, it seemed my life had been filled with meaning.
But I am very sceptical of the tool I dedicated ten years of my life to.
So watch out for those Communist Parties.
You look a bit scared.
But in spite of this I feel jubilant inside, having told you all this.
Perhaps I haven't made that too clear.
Perhaps it doesn't matter that much, either.
You know, we could start over, Nina.
You don't understand anything, do you?
Why don't you please come up for a little cup of tea?
You don't understand anything.
You understand everything.

Honey, what's wrong?
Every jackass thinks he knows what war is.
Especially those who've never been in one.
We like things nice and simple, good and evil, heroes and villains.
There's always plenty of both.
Most of the time, they are not who we think they are.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where...
Where is he?
Where is he?
Mr. Bradley?
Mr. B?
You okay?
-Where is he?
-Where is who?
Where is he?
Where did he go?
Where...
Where is he?
All right.
Just stay right here, okay?
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
It'll be okay.
Where is he?
Most guys I knew would never talk about what happened over there.
Probably 'cause they're still trying to forget about it.
They certainly didn't think of themselves as heroes.
They died without glory.
Nobody has taken their pictures.
Only their buddies knew what they did.
I'd tell their folks they died for their country.
I'm not sure that was it.
Now, there were plenty other photos taken that day, but none anybody wanted to see.
What we see and do in war, the cruelty, is unbelievable.
But somehow we gotta make some sense of it.
To do that, we need a easy to understand truth and damn few words.
Film's ruined.
I don't know.
This one looks all right.
And if you can get a picture...
Now, the right picture can win or lose a war.
You're gonna want to see this.
Look at Vietnam.
The picture of that South Vietnamese officer blowing that fella's brains out of the side of his head, whammo!
That was it.
The war was lost.
We just hung around trying to pretend it wasn't.
Took a lot of other pictures that day.
None of them made a difference.
Thanks.
Appreciate it.
Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.
Country was bankrupt.
People were becoming cynical and tired of war.
Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon!
Where?
Right there.
Planting that flag, that's your brother.
Ma, all you can see is his behind.
And that's his.
I powdered and diapered it, I know my son.
That's him.
Go get your father.
Daddy, Ma's got a picture of Harlon's keister in the paper.
You watch your mouth, young man.
Thank you.
One photo, almost all on its own, turned that around.
It's on the front page of every major paper.
Over 200 dailies and they're all flooded with requests for prints.
I think we might have found it.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
-I gotta go get him.
-Oh, no, you don't.
Iggy, I gotta go.
I have a whole different theory.
He wants medical attention bad enough, he'll come to us.
Shut up and crawl over here, you lazy son-of-a-bitch!
As soon as that flare goes out.
-Crap.
Okay, well, I'll go with you.
-No.
You're actually gonna leave me here?
I'll be right back, just shoot some people.
I gotta go.
Oh, God.
Okay, it's okay.
Don't touch them.
Don't touch them.
Get your hands out of there.
Let me do that.
I'll do it, okay?
Don't look.
Keep your head back.
Keep your eyes on me.
All right, look at me.
I'll get it.
I'll take care of it.
We'll get this bandage on you.
We'll get you taken care of.
And we'll get you down to the bottom, all right?
Look, you're gonna be fine.
It's okay.
I'll do that.
I'll do that.
Here, put some pressure on that.
Put your hands on top and put some pressure on it.
Keep your head back.
Keep breathing.
Keep looking at me, all right?
Just keep looking at...
Doc.
Help me.
Help me.
All right.
Okay.
How's that feel?
-It feels good.
-It does?
All right.
-Good.
-All right.
I'm gonna go get a stretcher and get you down to the beach.
I'll be right back.
I'm all right.
Go and help someone who's hurt.
All right.
Hold on there.
-Where'd he go?
-Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
-I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
-I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Holy shit.
They expect us to climb this?
Or something just like it.
So, where you think they're sending us?
I think it's the desert, Franklin.
Well, that makes no sense at all.
Well, it's just military psychology.
They always train you for the desert on a volcano.
Now you're just having fun with me.
Harlon, take your men right.
-Watch for Bedouins.
-Yes, sir.
-What's a Bedouin?
-It's a guy with a camel.
Well, Jeez Louise, maybe we are going to the desert.
Now, you tilt that to the right, but what if the bullet comes from the left?
Bullets don't come from the left.
You know any left-handed Japs?
That makes about as much sense as you showering with your shoes on.
You don't even know why you do it, do you?
'Cause I don't tell you mean I don't know?
You do it 'cause Mike does it.
I'll ask him.
So you cut hair back home?
Some.
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?
No, I just studied it a little.
But not in barber school?
Nope.
-Gosh.
-Let me guess, Hayes is winning.
Chief, I had very little to do with Sitting Bull's death, so maybe you could stop taking it out on me.
Different tribe.
The Pimas fought on the side of the white man.
-See, now that's smart.
-That is smart.
Yeah.
Worked real good for us.
Good luck, fellas.
Hey, good night, Lindberg.
Dead bodies.
He cuts hair on dead bodies.
What?
Even I knew that.
-Who's in?
-Oh, I'm in.
I'm in.
It must be a lot easier with them not moving around and all.
-There's that.
-Yeah.
You know what I been thinking?
Well, they been telling us we need to buddy up and I think we'd make pretty good buddies.
And how do you figure that?
Well, you know, in that we have a lot in common.
So, why do you cut dead people's hair, anyway?
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.
You tell a lot of people that?
You actually chose the Marines because they got the best uniform?
No sense being a hero if you don't look like one.
Jacks.
Queens.
Shit.
Do anything on that reservation but play cards, Chief?
All right, listen up, you sorry bunch of leathernecks!
We practice going over the side tomorrow which means we ain't long for this piece of rock.
All right!
One more thing, any man who doesn't have his masturbation papers in order better get them signed by tomorrow night or he ain't going overseas.
-I got mine already.
-Oh, yeah.
I'm square.
Wait.
Why am I just hearing about this?
That's horseshit, Franklin.
I don't have to repeat everything twice for you.
No, I didn't hear nothing about no masturbating papers.
Heard they were running short.
You know, nobody tells me nothing.
That's real nice, guys.
All right, get your ass over to the officer in charge of records.
Maybe he got some more left.
-Leave your smokes.
I'll play for you.
-Thanks, Mike.
Listen, he calls you an idiot, you take it like a man, okay?
Just do not leave without signing them.
-I appreciate it, Sergeant.
-You got it.
What the hell happened to your hair, Rene?
Look like a goddamn corpse.
Three points of contact on that rope at all times.
Next four.
Over the side.
Let's go.
Keep moving.
Next four, over the side.
Just keep your eye on the guy below you.
That's all you gotta look at.
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.
Keep three points of contact on the rope at all times.
You see?
No big thing.
Just one step at a time and keep your hands on the vertical rope.
Remember, once you're in the boat move away from the rope.
Just make sure you keep three points of contact on the rope.
I got him!
All right, get that man out of the water.
Give me a hand.
Grab his pack.
Don't worry about him, Doc.
All right, quit skylarking!
Keep it moving!
He'll be fine.
Our target, Island X, is an ugly, smelly, dirty little scab of rock called lwo Jima.
It means "Sulfur Island," which accounts for the smell.
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop, you ask me.
After 20 straight days of bombing you won't find a blade of grass or a twig on it.
It wasn't that pretty to start with.
Captain?
lwo's just five-and-a-half miles long, two-and-a-half wide.
There's a lump down at the bottom.
That's Mount Suribachi.
On the maps in front of you the island is white.
Not much of it.
The black dots represent known enemy emplacements.
Coastal defense guns, dual-mount dual-purpose guns, covered artillery emplacements.
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes, and earth-covered structures.
I don't see any barracks or any other structures.
That's right.
And we still don't know why.
Now, this isn't just any island to them.
This isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, or Saipan.
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders in eight square miles.
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.
It's up to us to convince them.
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.
The 8th Ammo Company will land here to re-supply.
The Suribachi's guns are the biggest problem.
They can hit any point on the island.
We're sitting ducks until we take them out.
That's our job.
We cut across the island, right at the base, slit its throat, lop off its head.
And we take that mountain.
We take that mountain, we take their big guns.
We take their eyes.
Okay, I'm heading in.
Follow me.
Let's put a good show on for the Marines.
Close it up.
Take it right down to the deck.
Yeah, boys!
Man overboard portside!
See him?
Throw me a line!
He's right there.
-Where is he?
-Watch out, watch out, watch out.
Hawaii's that way!
Just keep paddling, Mac, we'll catch you on the way back!
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!
They're not gonna stop.
What?
None of them are.
They can't.
So much for "No man left behind."
-Sir.
-Come on in.
Look, I've had to make a few other changes.
I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.
-Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
-You bet.
Trouble is, I already told my men I'd see them through this.
That your James Cagney impersonation?
'Cause I've heard better.
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.
Look, this isn't your first time through this.
-You don't need to prove anything.
-No, sir.
You're not the best sergeant I've ever had, you're just the best one that's still walking.
-Block's a good man.
-Yes, sir, he is.
The men know him, he can step right in.
You know, I have actually thought this through.
Platoon sergeant puts you further away from the bullets.
I already gave them my word, sir.
I told them I'd bring them all home to their mothers which means I already lied to half of them.
Can't lie to the rest.
-How are your men?
-They'll do fine.
Except maybe Gagnon.
Our own Tyrone Power?
Yes, sir.
He's a good man, just might be better use further back from the lines.
I'll use him as a runner.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
Now get out of here.
Hear the good news, Doc?
We're going in with the first waves.
Hey, you do that again I'll take your head off!
Fucking dominoes.
Iggy, have you ever heard news you considered to be bad?
The first ones off the ship, Doc.
Means we don't go over the side of the ship.
We hop on a tractor, they drive us right there.
Oh, shit, that is good news.
You see?
What'd I tell you?
What's going on?
Look at that.
We're killing them!
We're killing them, Doc.
I was promised 10 days of shelling.
You're giving me three and saying that's the best you can do?
I don't give a shit!
My men hit that beach with less than 10 and I'll be taking them home to their mamas in buckets!
Yeah, I know exactly why.
Because every Navy man with a scrambled egg on his chest wants to offload us here and sail to Japan so they can be there for the big finish, tell their kids they captured the Emperor all by themselves.
Well, you aren't going to Japan unless we take this piece of shit island!
These little pricks are dug in!
Okay, appreciate that, Jim.
Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
I'm okay.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
Jesus, Iggy, just leave me alone, all right?
How about you guys?
Knife?
Bayonet?
Kick in the ass?
How about you, Doc?
Sharpen your knife?
You sharpened it three times already.
Well, then I better make sure I didn't nick it.
Good man, Doc.
-Hey, Doc.
-Yeah.
When we land, try not to wave this kit around too much.
They got sharpshooters that are trained to look for them.
And they know that if they take out a corpsman another dozen Marines will die unattended.
All right?
Okay, Mike.
Yeah, right there.
Close the damn door.
For God's sake.
Yeah, like that's gonna help.
That your girlfriend, Chief?
Bet she's a pretty damn good-looking squaw.
Bet you're missing her, and that little wigwam of yours.
Welcome, all Marines off Iwo Jima.
We have a long-time wait...
It's what they do to prisoners,
-at least the lucky ones.
-Jesus.
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think about waving a white bandanna.
Poor Marines, so far from home for no good reason.
Think of your girls back home, waiting for you.
But a girl cannot stay home every night.
So who do you think they're with tonight?
And will she let him kiss her?
And will he comfort her at your funeral?
This sweet music is to make you think of your girls back home who are missing you.
This is all for now.
I'll see you tomorrow night.
Gunners!
Move, let's go!
Let's go, get up on the berm!
Gunners!
We're clear!
Get up the berm!
Baker Company, move out!
-Seen Second Platoon?
-I don't see them.
First Squad, move it out!
God, this place reeks.
-Go, go, go!
-Move out!
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go!
Go!
Go, go!
Drop your packs!
Go!
All clear!
-Jesus, you needed some exercise?
-He got lost.
A hundred landing craft heading for one beach and this guy gets lost.
Now I'm glad we did.
Jesus, what a mess.
Any theories why they ain't shooting?
It's getting on my nerves.
Maybe they're all dead.
What do you think, Doc?
You think they're all dead?
Mike, take six men and bring that gun onto the beach.
Second Platoon, let's move out!
Stay down.
Come on.
Move!
Move!
-Get down!
-Take cover!
Move out!
Cover fire!
Pour it on!
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!
Corpsman!
I'm gonna sling your arm and then I'll give you a shot for the pain!
Move, move!
Off the beach!
Take cover!
You got a girl back home, Marine?
We're gonna make sure she sees you, all right?
I need pressure on this wound!
Where's the fire coming from?
Where are they?
Look for a flash, shoot at it!
Let's go, let...
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!
You're over!
Third Squad, forward!
Move!
Where are they, sir?
We got ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock, pillbox!
Sergeant!
-Sergeant!
I think I can clear that out.
-What?
All right, you go.
Here.
Take these.
Check your weapon.
Yeah?
Go!
Cover!
Cover him!
Cover, cover!
Son-of-a-bitch.
Let's go!
Go!
Move it out!
Go, go, go!
Down, down, down!
It's clear.
Good work.
I thought you said it was clear!
It was!
Shit, I guess they're not in there firing at us then.
Lindberg!
Yeah!
Light it up!
I'll cover you, Ice!
Don't cover shit!
There's already enough people shooting!
One bullet and this thing goes up like a Roman candle!
Go!
Shift fire!
Shift your fire!
Go, go!
Shift your fire!
Shift your fire!
Go!
Move it out!
Hit the deck!
Stay down!
Wait for support!
Is this a bad battle or what?
It's a fucking slaughter.
Christ Jesus!
Get a machine gun team set up over here, now!
Thank God!
Tanks!
Runner!
Get those tanks up here!
Oh, shit.
Get down!
Corporal, watch your left flank!
Let's go without them!
Move out!
Move out!
Iggy, you gotta lift your side, he's gonna roll off.
Got it, Doc!
Incoming!
Move, move, move, move!
Keep moving!
Get that LVT up on the beach!
Keep moving!
You're next, pal, we're getting you out of here.
Move it!
Great news.
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa, 'cause that's where we're headed.
Not you and me.
Captain Severance asked me who else was in that picture, and Christ if I could remember, but it was Mike and Doc and Franklin and me and Hank Hansen but I just remembered, you were there, too.
I wasn't there.
'Course you were.
Neither was Hank.
He raised the first flag.
It was Harlon Block that raised that one.
Shit.
I told them it was Hank.
You weren't there, Mr. Smart Ass, how'd you know it was Harlon?
-You tell them it was me?
-No.
Like I said, I just remembered.
Good, keep your mouth shut.
They know there was somebody else, you can see it in the picture.
Then pick someone dead.
They don't want somebody dead, you dumb redskin, they want to ship us back to the States.
What did I tell you?
I wasn't there.
-You hear?
-All right.
Just settle down.
-I'm not going anywhere.
-You're not going anywhere.
Who the hell says?
This is horseshit.
You wounded, son?
No, sir.
Well, did you take out a nest of Japs butt-naked with your bare hands?
'Cause if I'm gonna give up my seat to a hero he better have a good goddamn story to tell.
No, sir.
Then enjoy it, 'cause they'll forget you before Christmas.
The sixth man, you got a name?
Sorry, still don't remember.
It's a damn shame, 'cause I promised the Major you'd know who it was.
Fact, you not knowing throws a doubt on you being one of the flag-raisers yourself.
Since no one wants to be embarrassed, the moment you land they'll turn you around, ship you off to Okinawa in time to meet your buddies on the beach.
So, why don't you stop screwing with me?
Give me a damn name.
Gangway!
Gangway!
Let's go, let's go!
Gangway!
Where the hell is that son-of-a-bitch?
Hayes!
Hayes?
Hayes, get your red ass over here!
Make me look like I don't know what my own men are doing with a flag the size of my mother's house?
God damn it, Ira, you shouldn't have lied to me.
You made me look like a complete asshole.
We're gonna miss you around here.
Good luck.
Now your name's in the paper, too.
Just heard your doctor say we're postponing your operation.
You're being shipped back to the mainland.
Everybody who saw that picture thought planting the flag meant victory.
That's all they wanted to know.
Victory.
Within a few weeks of that picture being taken, half the men in it were dead.
Mrs. Hansen!
Mrs. Hansen!
Did you know Hank was a hero?
-Are you proud of him, Mrs. Hansen?
-What was he like as a boy?
Look this way, please, ma'am.
What do you have to say about your son?
But somehow being a part of it meant something.
Looking at it, you could believe their sacrifice was not a waste.
Yeah, I might have thought that was Harlon, too.
It is.
Belle, their names are right here.
It's not him.
And he would be alive and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.
You think about that when you look at his picture, Ed.
And I need to rush home and change because there's the Governor's banquet and then there's the parade.
Imagine, the Governor is coming here to meet us.
Now, I'm wearing blue so, if...
-Are you going to change?
-We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin from CBS World News.
A press association has just announced that President Roosevelt is dead.
The President died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
All we know so far is that the President died at Warm Springs in Georgia.
Further updates every hour.
Temperatures will remain the same today, in the mid-30s to low 40s with clear skies.
Hello?
Yes.
Of course.
No, we understand.
It wouldn't be right.
Thank you.
Here he is, gentlemen.
Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.
Senator Haddigan.
I'd like you to meet Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Damn good to meet you.
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.
Sorry?
That's Pima Indian talk, boy, don't you know your own language?
Took forever to memorize the damn gibberish.
Sorry, I've been away from the reservation too long, Senator.
-Doc.
-Ira.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
-That's you.
-Go, go, go, go.
Go.
Please welcome
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley,
Private First Class Ira Hayes,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon!
Holy shit.
Come in, come in, come in.
Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.
-Rene Gagnon.
-Bud Gurber.
-You showing the boys the sights?
-We saw a hell of a ball game.
That's great.
The bar's there, help yourself.
I got some briefing sheets for you here, just some simple things we want you to say.
Mostly, "Buy bonds," can't say that too often.
Itineraries, those are changing every couple minutes.
Everybody wants to meet you guys.
I got women sending up envelopes with stockings in them, notes written in lipstick.
We won't mention that to the press, am I right?
Have a drink, for Christ's sake.
My God, what you boys must have seen over there.
I've been watching the newsreels.
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.
So, we got a hell of a lot of money to raise, not a lot of time.
White House tomorrow, then we trot you over to shake hands with a couple of hundred Congressmen who won't pull a penny out of their pockets.
Politicians and actors.
You put them in a restaurant together, they'd die of old age before picking up the check.
Then New York City, Times Square, dinners with various hoi polloi, then Chicago...
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?
That's what we're calling the mothers of the dead flag-raisers.
You present each mother with a flag, they say a few words, people will shit money.
It'll be so moving.
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.
Lovely woman.
She knows how close you and her son were.
He wrote home about you.
She is very, very much looking forward to meeting you.
Hank wasn't in the picture.
Sorry?
Hank didn't raise that flag.
He raised the other one, the real flag.
The what?
The real...
The real flag?
There's a real flag?
Yeah, ours was the replacement flag.
We put it up when they took the other one down.
Am I the only one getting a headache here?
You know about this?
It was after it was already in the papers.
The mothers had already been told, but...
That's it, that's beautiful.
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Yeah, why tell me?
I'm only the guy that has to explain it to 150 million Americans.
Who is in the goddamn picture?
Are any of you guys in the goddamn picture?
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.
Six guys raising a flag over lwo Jima.
Victory is ours.
You're three of them, right?
This was the fifth day, sir.
The battle went on for 35 more.
Well, what'd you do, raise a goddamn flag every time you stopped for lunch?
Can I hit this guy?
You know what, I don't give a shit, you're in the picture, you raised the flag, that's the story we're selling, boys.
Are you deaf?
Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?
Harlon Block.
That's whose mother should be here if anyone's should be.
You know, I think this whole damn thing is a farce, you ask me.
You know what they're calling this bond drive?
The Mighty Seventh.
They might've called it the
"We're Flat Fucking Broke And Can't Even Afford Bullets
"So We're Begging For Your Pennies" bond drive, but it didn't have quite the ring.
They could've called it that, though, because the last four bond drives came up so short we just printed money instead.
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street, he'll tell you our dollar is next to worthless, we borrowed so much.
And nobody is lending any more.
Ships aren't being built.
Tanks aren't being built.
Machine guns, bazookas, hand grenades, zip.
You think this is a farce?
You want to go back to your buddies?
Well, stuff some rocks in your pockets before you get on the plane because that's all we got left to throw at the Japanese.
And don't be surprised if your plane doesn't make it off the runway because the fuel dumps are empty.
And our good friends, the Arabs, are only taking bullion.
If we don't raise $14 billion, and that's million with a "B," this war is over by the end of the month.
We make a deal with the Japanese, we give whatever they want and we come home, because you've seen them fight, and they sure as shit ain't giving up.
$14 billion.
The last three drives didn't make that much all together.
People on the street corners, they looked at this picture and they took hope.
Don't ask me why, I think it's a crappy picture myself.
You can't even see your faces.
But it said we can win this war, are winning this war, we just need you to dig a little deeper.
They want to give us that money.
No, they want to give it to you.
But you, you don't want to ask for it.
You don't want to give them hope.
You want to explain about this person and that flag.
Well, that's your choice.
Because if we admit we made a mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about and that will be that.
Gentlemen.
Mr. President, here they are.
-Well, hello.
Good to see you.
-Mr.
President.
Darn good to see you, boys.
Heard you had a hell of a fight on your hands out there, hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation in Arizona, am I right?
Yes, Mr. President.
Being an Indian, you are a truer American than any of us.
Bet your people are proud to see you wear that uniform.
Very proud, sir.
They should be.
Well, I want to thank you for coming all this way to Washington to help us out.
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific now we need you to fight for a mountain of cash.
-And I don't expect you'll let us down.
-No, sir.
Good.
Go get it.
That's the end of this ceremony.
Let's take a look at this famous photo over here, see if I can pick you out.
My gosh.
There you are.
Boys.
Boys, this one's on me.
To those who can't be with us.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon.
May we have your autograph?
I suppose.
And your name is?
I don't know about you, but I get the impression
I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.
You're such a hero.
I feel honored to be in your presence.
That's just not true.
That's professional work.
Here, to professionals.
Here they are.
You're the guys in the photograph, right?
I heard you were on the train.
Let me shake your hands, John Tennack.
John Bradley.
These boys are with me, Harvard and Yale types, didn't fight a lick.
Pappies all rich sons-of-bitches.
Boys, shake hands with some real war heroes.
Excuse me for one moment.
You can buy them a drink while you're at it.
That's right.
Drinks for these men all the way around.
And you're the other one, aren't you?
John Tennack, Tennack Homes.
-Rene Gagnon.
-Pleased to meet you.
Have a drink, come on.
And here's my card.
Listen to me, Rene, when you get finished being famous you come see me because if you can sell bonds, you can sell homes.
Now, they're not gonna build homes anymore, they're gonna deliver them.
-You heard of prefab homes?
-No, sir.
Well, you will.
And you hang on to that card and you come see me, you hear?
-All right?
-Certainly will.
All right.
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?
If Mike and the guys could see us.
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it, would they?
Harlon!
Franklin!
Can you imagine Franklin on this train
eating at the dining car with all the silver?
We shouldn't be here, Doc.
There's gonna be a Hallelujah Day
When the boys have all come home to stay
And a million bands begin to play
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
And when we've lit the torch of liberty
In each blacked-out land across the sea
Ira!
Hey, Ira!
We heard the picture was posed!
What?
We heard you posed the picture!
Hey, Doc!
We're bigger than life, Doc!
And we'll heave a mighty sigh
When each gal can kiss the boy she kissed goodbye
And they'll come marching down Fifth Avenue
The United Nations in review
When this lovely dream has all come true
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
Good job.
Thank you.
Thank you, girls!
And now, here are the men you've been waiting to meet, the men in white.
Right behind me here, the heroes of Iwo Jima,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon,
Private First Class Ira Hayes, and Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley!
Thank you.
It's good of you people to come out tonight in support of the war effort.
We really need you to buy bonds, that's for sure.
'Cause we can't win the war without your help.
As far as us being the heroes of Iwo Jima, that's just not the case.
We really didn't do much at all.
Especially him.
Especially me.
I was just a runner.
That's it.
We put up a flag.
The pole we attached it to was heavy, so it took a number of us.
We had our picture taken doing it.
The real heroes are dead on that island.
And we'd appreciate it if you bought bonds in honor of them.
Thank you.
Jump on any grenades, Ira?
Take out any machine gun nests I missed?
At least I fired my weapon.
All right, knock it off.
You hit anything or were you too drunk then, too?
What?
Guys!
Come on!
Stop it.
Knock it off.
The tall man with the high hat will be coming down your way
Get your savings out when you hear him shout
"Any bonds today?"
Any bonds today?
Bonds of freedom that's what I'm selling
Any bonds today?
Rene, right here.
Sit between these two boys.
Here comes the freedom man
Asking you to buy a share of freedom today ...for us and they need our help.
And, if you think about it, I think you'll realize that buying more bonds is not just the right thing to do but the only thing to do.
Yes, this war has gone on too long.
We have given too many lives.
And its cost...
-Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
-Strawberry.
...has been far too high.
But if we waver now, if we don't dig deep and give more than we think we can then those sacrifices would be wasted...
Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
...and those lives lost in vain.
Let's move!
Go, go!
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over.
Where the hell are our tanks?
Stuck in the sand.
Captain says you're to go without them.
Christ.
That's real good work you're doing there, Rene.
All right, prepare to move out.
Pass the word.
Second Platoon!
Move!
Move!
Move!
All right, Second Platoon, on your feet!
Let's move out!
Jackass.
Let's move out!
Go, go!
Move, move, move!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Second Platoon, move out!
Doc!
Doc, get out of there!
Corpsman!
Doc!
Doc, get the hell out of there!
May I have your attention, please.
Train number 48 with service from New York City, Boston,
Rochester, New York,
Toledo, Ohio, and South Bend, Indiana is now arriving on Track 7.
Train number 48 now arriving on Track number 7.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.
-Come on, boys.
-Let's go.
-Watch your step, ma'am.
-Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the heroes of Iwo Jima.
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.
Private First Class Ira Hayes.
And Private First Class Rene Gagnon.
Rene!
That's my boyfriend!
Who the hell is that?
I don't know.
-Rene, is that your girl?
-Hey, what do they call you?
How about a photo?
Hey, look at that!
What's your name, doll?
What's your name?
Hey, she's a beauty.
Let's go find a saloon.
Smile, boys.
Give them their money's worth.
Hey, Doc, how's the tour going for you?
Thank you.
Where exactly are you staying?
-I'm not sure yet.
-Just forget about that.
Senator, I'd like you to meet Corpsman John Bradley.
-Doc, right?
-Yes, sir.
Nice to meet you, Senator.
Good to meet you, young man.
Now, we appreciate everything you've done and everything you're doing.
-Thank you, sir.
-Quite all right.
This is Captain White.
-Colonel Johns.
-We're proud of you, Corpsman.
And then Colonel McCourtney.
-Major General Green.
-Nice to meet you.
Senator, this is Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Of course!
Now I hear you used a tomahawk on those Japs.
Is that true, Chief?
No, sir.
Well, tell them you did, makes a better story, huh?
-Attaboy.
-This is Captain Green.
John?
Madeline Evelley.
I recognize you from all the photographs.
I'm Hank's mom.
It's so nice to meet you, ma'am.
Hank was always talking about you.
This is PFC Rene Gagnon.
Pleasure to meet you, son.
Thanks for everything.
-My pleasure.
-Not at all.
Ira, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Strank, Mike's mom.
It's all right.
When I got the telegram, I...
I don't know what I'm trying to say here.
Knowing he was with you that day and seeing him in that photograph,
I don't know why it makes me feel better, but it does.
-It's so silly, isn't it?
-No, it's not.
How are you, son?
Thank you very much.
We're the largest furniture wholesaler in Illinois.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
-I'll make sure he calls.
-Well, thank you.
Thank you.
Are you Rene?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Franklin's mother.
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.
I'm Pauline, Rene's girlfriend.
Would you mind?
Paper said that's Hank, and I honestly can't tell.
It's horrible of a mother not to know her own son, isn't it?
But that's him, isn't it?
Well, to be honest, ma'am, it happened so quick, and with everything that was going on it's kind of hard to remember who was where.
But...
Yeah, I think...
I think that's where he was.
That's Hank.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Excuse us.
Take him outside.
I'm Pauline.
-Very nice to meet you.
-Hi, nice to meet you.
He was the best Marine I ever knew.
Thank you.
-You okay, Chief?
-Oh, Christ!
I'm okay.
Yeah, you look it.
You're gonna screw this up, aren't you?
You're gonna screw it up for all of us.
I've got him.
Get some sleep, Ira.
-Mike?
-Yeah?
-You see this?
-What?
-Mike!
-Oh, shit, go!
He's killing me!
Hey, Doc, you think they got them all?
What?
Well, they're not shooting at us.
Maybe we killed them all.
Or they ran off in the night or something.
Or they're waiting for us to start climbing.
Third Platoon!
Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.
-Just us?
-Yeah, just us, lgg.
All right, Third Platoon, move!
I tag along?
Yeah, you can lead the way if you want.
Get a good shot of my face.
It's your ass I'm gonna make famous, Hank.
Hey, that'll work for me, too.
Lieutenant, if you make it to the top, put this up.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, Iggy.
They never shoot at the first patrol.
-They don't?
-No.
They want us to go up to the top, signal to the others that it's okay, then shoot everybody else as they come up the mountain.
-Really?
-Yeah.
Unless of course they want to make an example of us and discourage all the others.
I think you're full of crap, you know that, Hank?
Really?
Jesus.
Thank God that ain't us.
Told you.
Boots, spread them out and put them on a line.
Set up a perimeter!
First Squad!
-Hank?
Find me a pole.
-Yeah.
Let's put this flag up.
Watch it.
Right over here.
Right here.
That's good.
That's good.
Right here, right here.
Got that end?
Hold that steady.
Lindberg.
-Hey, who's got rope?
-Right here.
Give me something.
Yeah, good.
That work?
Do it, fellas.
Keep it coming.
USMC!
USMC!
Shit, look at that!
Jeez, look at that.
Get down!
Take cover!
Cover with that .30!
-Watch it!
Twenty yards down, Hank!
-You see them?
-I got about 20 yards, left side.
-Lindberg, get the flamethrower!
-Boots, you see them?
-Cover right!
-About 20 yards down!
Duck one!
-You see them?
Keep the cover on!
Second Squad, you see them?
Get me some grenades!
I see them!
You see them?
Right flank, over to the right!
Cover me, I'm going down!
Careful, Iggy.
Easy.
All clear!
Okay, guys, who wants to be famous?
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
-God damn it.
Strank!
-Sir?
They want a phone line run up to the top of the mountain.
Let me guess, they picked us.
Second Platoon, let's go.
Get some exercise.
Let's go!
Get off your ass.
Oh, shit!
Hope it still works, 'cause you're not getting mine!
-Get Forrestal!
-All right, then.
I don't know whose idea it was, Mr. Secretary.
Well, it was goddamn brilliant.
I want that flag, Holland.
Mark my words, raising that son-of-a-bitch means a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.
I want that flag.
Yes, sir.
I'll make sure no one touches it.
You can count on me.
Fuck that.
That flag belongs to the men in this battalion.
That son-of-a-bitch thinks that our men died taking this ground so we could hand over our flag to some politician to pin to his wall?
He's out of his goddamn mind!
Get me that flag, and find another one to replace it.
You've gotta be shitting me.
Gagnon!
Get your ass over here.
Hey.
Hi, fellas.
How's it going?
Missed a beautiful shot, Joe.
It's that kind of day.
-Hey, Mike.
-Hell of a view, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant!
Captain says he wants that flag.
He wants this flag?
Yes, sir.
-We just put the damn thing up.
-Yes, sir.
Some kind of flag shortage?
He wants you to put this one up instead.
Hey, Mike.
Do me a favor and put this up, will you?
Yes, sir.
All right, let's find a pole.
Take the flag down, boys.
Captain's orders.
You heard him, let's do it.
There you go.
Lordy, she's a heavy one.
All right, hang on.
Put this on.
One hell of a view, huh?
Good view from up here.
Yes, I'd say so myself.
All right.
-Not in your way here, am I, Joe?
-Nah, I'm fine, thanks.
Hey, Doc, you wanna give us a hand here?
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.
Ready?
Ready?
Let's go.
You get it?
I don't know.
I wish I could've seen their faces.
Nobody even noticed that second flag going up.
Everybody saw that damn picture and made up their own story about it.
But your dad and the others knew what they had done and what they had not done.
All your friends dying, it's hard not to be called a hero for saving somebody's life.
But for putting up a pole?
You gotta be kidding.
Hey!
It took a lot of talented folks a long time to make that thing.
Just wait till tonight when it's lit properly and there's thousands of cheering people in the stands.
It's gonna look a lot better.
So, stadium lights come down, spotlight comes up and you get your cue.
You charge up this thing with the flag, you plant it at the top.
You smile, you wave.
You know the drill.
You want us to plant the flag on a pile of papier-mâché.
Hey, that's show biz.
And try and stand how you stood the first time you planted it.
Just, you know, pretend the other three guys are with you.
The dead guys.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, not a problem.
Good.
But where do we imagine Hank is standing?
Sorry?
Well, seeing that he wasn't there, it'll be kind of hard for us to leave a space for him.
I think you know exactly where he was.
You pointed him out to his mother.
This is bullshit.
I planted that damn thing once, and I'm not doing it again.
-Hayes!
-Oh, for Christ's sake.
Hayes.
Hayes, get your ass back here or you're going on report.
Hayes!
You wanna do your damn job?
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Come on!
He's with me!
Hey, he's with me!
-Back off!
-Sir, he's with me.
Okay?
He's with me.
Ira, put the goddamn chair down!
-Put the chair down, son!
-Put the chair down, Ira!
Tell them drop their sticks!
Ira, they're cops, they're supposed to have nightsticks.
You're not supposed to be in the street swinging a chair.
-Calm down, son.
-Sir, turn around, please.
That poster right there?
The one on the end, that's him.
-That's him?
-Yes, sir.
You read the papers?
Christ.
We got another fucking hero.
Get him out of here.
-Can you do that?
-Yes, sir.
Put the goddamn chair down.
And let's go.
Did you start this?
He didn't serve me!
I don't make the rules.
We don't serve Indians.
He needs to go sleep it off.
Soldier Field.
You hear that?
What the hell is that?
I can't figure it out.
Keep an eye out.
It sounds like it's coming from up there.
They're using grenades.
They're killing themselves.
Ira, let's go.
Come on.
Let's go, Ira.
Come on.
Thank God.
Jesus.
Look at you, Chief.
You found him.
Holy shit.
You would have to pick today.
Vandegrift is here with enough brass to start a fucking band.
Come on, let's go.
Can you walk?
-Yes, sir.
-By yourself?
All right, look.
I don't care if you have to carry him get him to the top, plant that flag, and don't fucking fall off.
Get him in his stuff.
I'll stall these guys for as long as I can.
Hurry up.
Jesus Christ.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Cover!
Harlon!
Harlon!
Get your fire team up in that position!
O'Hare!
First Fire Team!
Work around!
BAR, you, on the side of the ridge!
Covering fire, boys, go, go, go!
Jackson, work your team around to the left!
Cover!
Left flank!
Left flank!
Franklin, Gust, go check it out!
Hustle up, boys!
We got them!
Clear!
One hell of an experience.
Move out!
Cease fire!
They're my men!
You're targeting our men!
You're targeting our...
Get me another radio!
Sergeant?
Sergeant!
Mike!
Mike, Mike, Mike.
Mike?
Mike.
Hey, where's Doc?
Corpsman!
Oh, shit.
How's his breathing?
Harlon, move, buddy.
Hey, Mike.
Mike, Mike, can you hear us?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on, Mike.
Mike?
Mike, can you hear us?
All right, let's go!
Move out!
I'm gonna get a stretcher.
Let's take him down, move him off the beach.
Ladies and gentlemen, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Corpsman!
Hank!
Hank!
Doc, they killed me.
Harlon!
Doc, they killed me.
Come on, Harlon.
Harlon, stay with me.
Franklin!
I'm fine, Ira.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
-Where'd he go?
-Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
-I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
-I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Does it open?
Iggy!
Iggy!
Iggy, are you down there?
Iggy!
Can't tell who it is, but he's one of ours.
I had to go outside to throw up.
Look what they did to the poor son-of-a-bitch.
You okay, Chief?
Just let it go.
If that doesn't pry open their wallets, nothing will.
Jesus Christ, he's drunk.
Goddamn Indians.
Come on, Chief.
Let's get you home.
That's not what I hear.
I called around, I'm not stupid.
He's been drunk since he started this damn tour, making a spectacle of himself.
Just about choked that poor woman at the reception, blubbering.
Jesus Christ, you're supposed to be watching these men.
Yes, sir.
Well, he's making us look like regular asses.
Well, with all due respect, sir, he never wanted to come on this trip in the first place.
We had to pull him, kicking and screaming, off that boat.
He wants to be with his unit.
What unit?
They're all fucking dead.
This is how he honors those men?
By drinking and throwing up, and...
You know what?
He wants it, great, we'll send him back.
Get him packed and on a train today.
He's an embarrassment to the uniform.
Yes, sir.
I'll do it.
Yeah, no, that's...
That's good.
That's what I want.
I know it's a good thing, raising the money and that, 'cause we need it.
But,
I can't take them calling me a hero.
All I did was try not to get shot.
Some of the things I saw done, things I did,
they weren't things to be proud of, you know?
Mike...
Mike was a hero.
You ever meet him?
No.
Best Marine I ever met.
You know, Chief, I think if Mike was sitting here instead of you he'd be saying the same thing about himself,
not being a hero.
Maybe.
He was a good guy.
But I think that he would be ashamed of me, seeing me the way I am.
Think I could see my ma before they ship me off?
Think they'd do that?
See my ma?
I'm sorry, Ira.
We got stories now to tell our kids, I guess.
Keep your head down.
All aboard.
Good luck, Chief.
I think I saw him once after that.
It was maybe six or seven years after the war.
I was working as a salesman, doing a lot of driving.
I was driving west across Texas.
I was just trying to get where I was going so I could get home.
And I saw this guy hitchhiking on the side of the road.
And, for a second, I thought it might've been him.
I always regret that I didn't stop, but I was in a hurry.
And he was an Indian.
We always told the press that Ira insisted that he was going back to fight with his unit which was at least partially true, but
that isn't what got the headlines.
We're engaged.
Excuse me a minute, darling.
-Hey, Doc?
-Yeah?
-Got a minute?
-Yeah.
I'll see you at the car.
-You hear I'm getting married?
-I did, Rene.
That's great.
Yeah, it's something she wants.
She waited for me all this time.
She's not used to all this, but she's a good girl.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
So, I was wondering if you'd be my best man.
Me?
Don't you have somebody at home, a buddy, you'd rather ask?
Well, I didn't really make many.
The ones who didn't go, it's...
Well, it's hard to even talk to them.
You know?
Yeah, I know.
I'd be proud to.
Thank you.
I better go drag her away from them before she announces
I'm gonna be president of General Motors or something.
All right.
-Congratulations.
-Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Rene, you're a lucky man.
-Big smile, Mrs. Gagnon!
-Say cheese!
I couldn't complain because the press loved them, so they wrote more articles and people bought more bonds.
The tour went on with just Rene and your dad.
And the true heroes are the men who didn't make it home from lwo Jima, the men who died at Iwo Jima and in other campaigns.
We ask that you honor the memory of those men by buying the war bonds and helping us to win this war.
Thank you.
City after city, I thought the damn thing'd never end.
And this rumor kept going around that the photograph had been staged.
I remember your dad telling them that he wished he'd known he was having his picture taken because he would've ducked the hell out of it.
Whose idea was it?
Who wanted to stage the thing?
Come on, it was you?
Was there truth to the rumor that that picture was staged, Doc?
-Come on!
Doc?
-Can you answer that?
I remember when your dad got shot.
All hell was busting loose.
People back home saw that picture and thought it was over when we took Suribachi.
We wished.
Anyways, we're pinned down.
Mortars, shells, machine guns.
Fire coming from every which direction, right?
And we hear somebody call, "Corpsman down."
Corpsman down!
Blood was spurting out of his throat, and Doc was doing everything he could.
And the Corpsman looks up at him and he knows what this means, to be shot in the neck.
He knows he's dying, you can see that.
But still in his eyes, he's pleading with Doc to save his life.
And Doc can't.
-You okay, Doc?
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-Yeah, you look fine.
-I'm okay.
Keep down, all right?
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.
Okay.
Corpsman.
Corpsman!
For God sake, Corpsman!
Corpsman?
Corpsman.
Incoming!
Let me see.
It's not that bad.
You're gonna be okay.
All right?
Just stay with me.
Look at me.
Took us a half-hour to find your dad.
He could've bled to death.
Coming down.
Thanks.
Vets'll tell you about being hit but not wanting to leave their buddies.
Usually, they're lying.
You'll take any excuse to get out of there.
But it happens.
You get the feeling you're letting them down.
I could see that in your dad's face.
He wanted to go, he'd seen enough.
But he didn't want to leave us.
Now, he was a hell of a good man, your dad.
Yeah.
While we were sitting there on the beach, we heard this great roar.
And we looked up.
That was the first of thousands of landings on Iwo.
-Look at that.
-Yeah.
How about that.
I'm gonna head back, all right?
Good luck.
That island saved a lot of lives.
A lot of lives.
I don't know what else to tell you.
After the bond tour my dad finally got his operation.
By the time he got home the war was over.
First thing he did was ask my mom to marry him.
Ira tried to get on with his life and put it all behind him.
Thank you for having me here today.
It's an honor to be in front of such a strong people.
Because of the war white men will understand Indians a lot better.
And it's going to be a better world.
But life had other plans for him.
You're...
You're him, aren't you?
You're the hero, right?
Great.
All right, kids, go get your picture taken.
Oh, that's great.
That's great.
All right, now say cheese.
Cheese!
That's great!
Okay.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Thanks.
-Come on.
-That's a hero, kids.
Hero, lift this basket, will you?
It's too heavy for me.
Rene tried to take advantage of those offers he'd received on the bond tour.
Yes.
G-A-G-N-O-N.
Right.
Pronounced Rene.
Rene, yes.
-Okay, I actually called last week.
-Yes.
Okay, yes.
Mr. Gagnon.
I gave Mr. Tennack your message.
I'm sure he'll call you.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
But he was yesterday's hero.
He even applied for a job at the local police station.
They said he wasn't qualified.
After working the factory with Pauline he tried a few things but spent the rest of his life as a janitor.
But Ira...
Ira!
You got a visitor.
Ira always made the news.
I could never find out why he did it, but one day Ira just took off.
He walked and hitched over 1,300 miles from Arizona to Texas.
He found Harlon Block's father working his field.
His wife, Belle, had left him soon after they discovered Harlon died.
She never forgave him for letting her son go off to war.
And Ira told him the truth, that it had been his son who raised the flag with them, his son in the photograph.
And then he just turned and walked away.
Though the flag-raising meant nothing to him, he somehow knew it would mean everything to them.
Thanks for calling.
Just as Belle knew all along.
The press soon found out and called Hank's mom with the news that it wasn't her son after all.
The last time they all saw each other was at the unveiling of the Marine Corps War Memorial.
And even though he planted the first flag above lwo Jima,
Hank's mother and father weren't invited.
Ira.
It's good to see you, Ira.
Hell of a statue.
It wasn't long after that that they found Ira.
The papers said he died of exposure.
There was no autopsy.
It was about that same time when my father got in his car early one morning telling my mom he had something to do.
He drove to a town on the other side of Wisconsin where Iggy's mom lived.
Ever since she heard the news about her son she'd been trying to find out how he died, and no one would tell her.
I never found out what he told her, but I can pretty much guarantee it wasn't the truth.
My mother would ask him what was troubling him.
He would never say.
And every year, as it got close to Memorial Day, the reporters would start calling asking to interview my father.
No, I'm sorry.
He's fishing in Canada.
We were always instructed to say the same thing.
Okay.
Thanks.
When Mr. McCandless retired, my father bought the funeral home where he'd worked since coming home.
He spent the rest of his life running the business and raising his family.
He never spoke about the war or about the flag-raising, never told us anything.
The first time I heard any of these stories was after he died.
Where is he?
Oh, God.
He's not here, Dad.
He died.
Who?
Who died?
Iggy.
Iggy.
Christ, poor lggy.
I hadn't thought of him for years.
How do you know about Iggy?
You were calling for him, when you collapsed.
I wasn't looking for Iggy.
I was looking for you.
I wanted to...
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry I wasn't a better father.
Talked to you more.
I just...
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
You were the best father a man could have.
Did I ever tell you they took us swimming?
No, Dad.
After we planted the flag, we came down off the mountain and they let us swim.
It was the funniest thing.
All this fighting and we were jumping around in the water like kids.
That's the way I remember lggy now.
I finally came to the conclusion that maybe he was right.
Maybe there's no such thing as heroes.
Maybe there are just people like my dad.
I finally came to understand why they were so uncomfortable being called heroes.
Heroes are something we create, something we need.
It's a way for us to understand what is almost incomprehensible, how people could sacrifice so much for us.
But for my dad and these men, the risks they took, the wounds they suffered, they did that for their buddies.
They may have fought for their country, but they died for their friends.
For the man in front, for the man beside them.
And if we wish to truly honor these men, we should remember them the way they really were, the way my dad remembered them.
Come on, Doc!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
For God sakes!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Honey, what's wrong?
Every jackass thinks he knows what war is.
Especially those who've never been in one.
We like things nice and simple, good and evil, heroes and villains.
There's always plenty of both.
Most of the time, they are not who we think they are.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where...
Where is he?
Where is he?
Mr. Bradley?
Mr. B?
You okay?
-Where is he?
-Where is who?
Where is he?
Where did he go?
Where...
Where is he?
All right.
Just stay right here, okay?
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
It'll be okay.
Where is he?
Most guys I knew would never talk about what happened over there.
Probably 'cause they're still trying to forget about it.
They certainly didn't think of themselves as heroes.
They died without glory.
Nobody has taken their pictures.
Only their buddies knew what they did.
I'd tell their folks they died for their country.
I'm not sure that was it.
Now, there were plenty other photos taken that day, but none anybody wanted to see.
What we see and do in war, the cruelty, is unbelievable.
But somehow we gotta make some sense of it.
To do that, we need a easy to understand truth and damn few words.
Film's ruined.
I don't know.
This one looks all right.
And if you can get a picture...
Now, the right picture can win or lose a war.
You're gonna want to see this.
Look at Vietnam.
The picture of that South Vietnamese officer blowing that fella's brains out of the side of his head, whammo!
That was it.
The war was lost.
We just hung around trying to pretend it wasn't.
Took a lot of other pictures that day.
None of them made a difference.
Thanks.
Appreciate it.
Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.
Country was bankrupt.
People were becoming cynical and tired of war.
Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon!
Where?
Right there.
Planting that flag, that's your brother.
Ma, all you can see is his behind.
And that's his.
I powdered and diapered it, I know my son.
That's him.
Go get your father.
Daddy, Ma's got a picture of Harlon's keister in the paper.
You watch your mouth, young man.
Thank you.
One photo, almost all on its own, turned that around.
It's on the front page of every major paper.
Over 200 dailies and they're all flooded with requests for prints.
I think we might have found it.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
-I gotta go get him.
-Oh, no, you don't.
Iggy, I gotta go.
I have a whole different theory.
He wants medical attention bad enough, he'll come to us.
Shut up and crawl over here, you lazy son-of-a-bitch!
As soon as that flare goes out.
-Crap.
Okay, well, I'll go with you.
-No.
You're actually gonna leave me here?
I'll be right back, just shoot some people.
I gotta go.
Oh, God.
Okay, it's okay.
Don't touch them.
Don't touch them.
Get your hands out of there.
Let me do that.
I'll do it, okay?
Don't look.
Keep your head back.
Keep your eyes on me.
All right, look at me.
I'll get it.
I'll take care of it.
We'll get this bandage on you.
We'll get you taken care of.
And we'll get you down to the bottom, all right?
Look, you're gonna be fine.
It's okay.
I'll do that.
I'll do that.
Here, put some pressure on that.
Put your hands on top and put some pressure on it.
Keep your head back.
Keep breathing.
Keep looking at me, all right?
Just keep looking at...
Doc.
Help me.
Help me.
All right.
Okay.
How's that feel?
-It feels good.
-It does?
All right.
-Good.
-All right.
I'm gonna go get a stretcher and get you down to the beach.
I'll be right back.
I'm all right.
Go and help someone who's hurt.
All right.
Hold on there.
-Where'd he go?
-Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
-I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
-I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Holy shit.
They expect us to climb this?
Or something just like it.
So, where you think they're sending us?
I think it's the desert, Franklin.
Well, that makes no sense at all.
Well, it's just military psychology.
They always train you for the desert on a volcano.
Now you're just having fun with me.
Harlon, take your men right.
-Watch for Bedouins.
-Yes, sir.
-What's a Bedouin?
-It's a guy with a camel.
Well, Jeez Louise, maybe we are going to the desert.
Now, you tilt that to the right, but what if the bullet comes from the left?
Bullets don't come from the left.
You know any left-handed Japs?
That makes about as much sense as you showering with your shoes on.
You don't even know why you do it, do you?
'Cause I don't tell you mean I don't know?
You do it 'cause Mike does it.
I'll ask him.
So you cut hair back home?
Some.
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?
No, I just studied it a little.
But not in barber school?
Nope.
-Gosh.
-Let me guess, Hayes is winning.
Chief, I had very little to do with Sitting Bull's death, so maybe you could stop taking it out on me.
Different tribe.
The Pimas fought on the side of the white man.
-See, now that's smart.
-That is smart.
Yeah.
Worked real good for us.
Good luck, fellas.
Hey, good night, Lindberg.
Dead bodies.
He cuts hair on dead bodies.
What?
Even I knew that.
-Who's in?
-Oh, I'm in.
I'm in.
It must be a lot easier with them not moving around and all.
-There's that.
-Yeah.
You know what I been thinking?
Well, they been telling us we need to buddy up and I think we'd make pretty good buddies.
And how do you figure that?
Well, you know, in that we have a lot in common.
So, why do you cut dead people's hair, anyway?
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.
You tell a lot of people that?
You actually chose the Marines because they got the best uniform?
No sense being a hero if you don't look like one.
Jacks.
Queens.
Shit.
Do anything on that reservation but play cards, Chief?
All right, listen up, you sorry bunch of leathernecks!
We practice going over the side tomorrow which means we ain't long for this piece of rock.
All right!
One more thing, any man who doesn't have his masturbation papers in order better get them signed by tomorrow night or he ain't going overseas.
-I got mine already.
-Oh, yeah.
I'm square.
Wait.
Why am I just hearing about this?
That's horseshit, Franklin.
I don't have to repeat everything twice for you.
No, I didn't hear nothing about no masturbating papers.
Heard they were running short.
You know, nobody tells me nothing.
That's real nice, guys.
All right, get your ass over to the officer in charge of records.
Maybe he got some more left.
-Leave your smokes.
I'll play for you.
-Thanks, Mike.
Listen, he calls you an idiot, you take it like a man, okay?
Just do not leave without signing them.
-I appreciate it, Sergeant.
-You got it.
What the hell happened to your hair, Rene?
Look like a goddamn corpse.
Three points of contact on that rope at all times.
Next four.
Over the side.
Let's go.
Keep moving.
Next four, over the side.
Just keep your eye on the guy below you.
That's all you gotta look at.
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.
Keep three points of contact on the rope at all times.
You see?
No big thing.
Just one step at a time and keep your hands on the vertical rope.
Remember, once you're in the boat move away from the rope.
Just make sure you keep three points of contact on the rope.
I got him!
All right, get that man out of the water.
Give me a hand.
Grab his pack.
Don't worry about him, Doc.
All right, quit skylarking!
Keep it moving!
He'll be fine.
Our target, Island X, is an ugly, smelly, dirty little scab of rock called lwo Jima.
It means "Sulfur Island," which accounts for the smell.
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop, you ask me.
After 20 straight days of bombing you won't find a blade of grass or a twig on it.
It wasn't that pretty to start with.
Captain?
lwo's just five-and-a-half miles long, two-and-a-half wide.
There's a lump down at the bottom.
That's Mount Suribachi.
On the maps in front of you the island is white.
Not much of it.
The black dots represent known enemy emplacements.
Coastal defense guns, dual-mount dual-purpose guns, covered artillery emplacements.
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes, and earth-covered structures.
I don't see any barracks or any other structures.
That's right.
And we still don't know why.
Now, this isn't just any island to them.
This isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, or Saipan.
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders in eight square miles.
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.
It's up to us to convince them.
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.
The 8th Ammo Company will land here to re-supply.
The Suribachi's guns are the biggest problem.
They can hit any point on the island.
We're sitting ducks until we take them out.
That's our job.
We cut across the island, right at the base, slit its throat, lop off its head.
And we take that mountain.
We take that mountain, we take their big guns.
We take their eyes.
Okay, I'm heading in.
Follow me.
Let's put a good show on for the Marines.
Close it up.
Take it right down to the deck.
Yeah, boys!
Man overboard portside!
See him?
Throw me a line!
He's right there.
-Where is he?
-Watch out, watch out, watch out.
Hawaii's that way!
Just keep paddling, Mac, we'll catch you on the way back!
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!
They're not gonna stop.
What?
None of them are.
They can't.
So much for "No man left behind."
-Sir.
-Come on in.
Look, I've had to make a few other changes.
I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.
-Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
-You bet.
Trouble is, I already told my men I'd see them through this.
That your James Cagney impersonation?
'Cause I've heard better.
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.
Look, this isn't your first time through this.
-You don't need to prove anything.
-No, sir.
You're not the best sergeant I've ever had, you're just the best one that's still walking.
-Block's a good man.
-Yes, sir, he is.
The men know him, he can step right in.
You know, I have actually thought this through.
Platoon sergeant puts you further away from the bullets.
I already gave them my word, sir.
I told them I'd bring them all home to their mothers which means I already lied to half of them.
Can't lie to the rest.
-How are your men?
-They'll do fine.
Except maybe Gagnon.
Our own Tyrone Power?
Yes, sir.
He's a good man, just might be better use further back from the lines.
I'll use him as a runner.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
Now get out of here.
Hear the good news, Doc?
We're going in with the first waves.
Hey, you do that again I'll take your head off!
Fucking dominoes.
Iggy, have you ever heard news you considered to be bad?
The first ones off the ship, Doc.
Means we don't go over the side of the ship.
We hop on a tractor, they drive us right there.
Oh, shit, that is good news.
You see?
What'd I tell you?
What's going on?
Look at that.
We're killing them!
We're killing them, Doc.
I was promised 10 days of shelling.
You're giving me three and saying that's the best you can do?
I don't give a shit!
My men hit that beach with less than 10 and I'll be taking them home to their mamas in buckets!
Yeah, I know exactly why.
Because every Navy man with a scrambled egg on his chest wants to offload us here and sail to Japan so they can be there for the big finish, tell their kids they captured the Emperor all by themselves.
Well, you aren't going to Japan unless we take this piece of shit island!
These little pricks are dug in!
Okay, appreciate that, Jim.
Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
I'm okay.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
Jesus, Iggy, just leave me alone, all right?
How about you guys?
Knife?
Bayonet?
Kick in the ass?
How about you, Doc?
Sharpen your knife?
You sharpened it three times already.
Well, then I better make sure I didn't nick it.
Good man, Doc.
-Hey, Doc.
-Yeah.
When we land, try not to wave this kit around too much.
They got sharpshooters that are trained to look for them.
And they know that if they take out a corpsman another dozen Marines will die unattended.
All right?
Okay, Mike.
Yeah, right there.
Close the damn door.
For God's sake.
Yeah, like that's gonna help.
That your girlfriend, Chief?
Bet she's a pretty damn good-looking squaw.
Bet you're missing her, and that little wigwam of yours.
Welcome, all Marines off Iwo Jima.
We have a long-time wait...
It's what they do to prisoners,
-at least the lucky ones.
-Jesus.
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think about waving a white bandanna.
Poor Marines, so far from home for no good reason.
Think of your girls back home, waiting for you.
But a girl cannot stay home every night.
So who do you think they're with tonight?
And will she let him kiss her?
And will he comfort her at your funeral?
This sweet music is to make you think of your girls back home who are missing you.
This is all for now.
I'll see you tomorrow night.
Gunners!
Move, let's go!
Let's go, get up on the berm!
Gunners!
We're clear!
Get up the berm!
Baker Company, move out!
-Seen Second Platoon?
-I don't see them.
First Squad, move it out!
God, this place reeks.
-Go, go, go!
-Move out!
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go!
Go!
Go, go!
Drop your packs!
Go!
All clear!
-Jesus, you needed some exercise?
-He got lost.
A hundred landing craft heading for one beach and this guy gets lost.
Now I'm glad we did.
Jesus, what a mess.
Any theories why they ain't shooting?
It's getting on my nerves.
Maybe they're all dead.
What do you think, Doc?
You think they're all dead?
Mike, take six men and bring that gun onto the beach.
Second Platoon, let's move out!
Stay down.
Come on.
Move!
Move!
-Get down!
-Take cover!
Move out!
Cover fire!
Pour it on!
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!
Corpsman!
I'm gonna sling your arm and then I'll give you a shot for the pain!
Move, move!
Off the beach!
Take cover!
You got a girl back home, Marine?
We're gonna make sure she sees you, all right?
I need pressure on this wound!
Where's the fire coming from?
Where are they?
Look for a flash, shoot at it!
Let's go, let...
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!
You're over!
Third Squad, forward!
Move!
Where are they, sir?
We got ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock, pillbox!
Sergeant!
-Sergeant!
I think I can clear that out.
-What?
All right, you go.
Here.
Take these.
Check your weapon.
Yeah?
Go!
Cover!
Cover him!
Cover, cover!
Son-of-a-bitch.
Let's go!
Go!
Move it out!
Go, go, go!
Down, down, down!
It's clear.
Good work.
I thought you said it was clear!
It was!
Shit, I guess they're not in there firing at us then.
Lindberg!
Yeah!
Light it up!
I'll cover you, Ice!
Don't cover shit!
There's already enough people shooting!
One bullet and this thing goes up like a Roman candle!
Go!
Shift fire!
Shift your fire!
Go, go!
Shift your fire!
Shift your fire!
Go!
Move it out!
Hit the deck!
Stay down!
Wait for support!
Is this a bad battle or what?
It's a fucking slaughter.
Christ Jesus!
Get a machine gun team set up over here, now!
Thank God!
Tanks!
Runner!
Get those tanks up here!
Oh, shit.
Get down!
Corporal, watch your left flank!
Let's go without them!
Move out!
Move out!
Iggy, you gotta lift your side, he's gonna roll off.
Got it, Doc!
Incoming!
Move, move, move, move!
Keep moving!
Get that LVT up on the beach!
Keep moving!
You're next, pal, we're getting you out of here.
Move it!
Great news.
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa, 'cause that's where we're headed.
Not you and me.
Captain Severance asked me who else was in that picture, and Christ if I could remember, but it was Mike and Doc and Franklin and me and Hank Hansen but I just remembered, you were there, too.
I wasn't there.
'Course you were.
Neither was Hank.
He raised the first flag.
It was Harlon Block that raised that one.
Shit.
I told them it was Hank.
You weren't there, Mr. Smart Ass, how'd you know it was Harlon?
-You tell them it was me?
-No.
Like I said, I just remembered.
Good, keep your mouth shut.
They know there was somebody else, you can see it in the picture.
Then pick someone dead.
They don't want somebody dead, you dumb redskin, they want to ship us back to the States.
What did I tell you?
I wasn't there.
-You hear?
-All right.
Just settle down.
-I'm not going anywhere.
-You're not going anywhere.
Who the hell says?
This is horseshit.
You wounded, son?
No, sir.
Well, did you take out a nest of Japs butt-naked with your bare hands?
'Cause if I'm gonna give up my seat to a hero he better have a good goddamn story to tell.
No, sir.
Then enjoy it, 'cause they'll forget you before Christmas.
The sixth man, you got a name?
Sorry, still don't remember.
It's a damn shame, 'cause I promised the Major you'd know who it was.
Fact, you not knowing throws a doubt on you being one of the flag-raisers yourself.
Since no one wants to be embarrassed, the moment you land they'll turn you around, ship you off to Okinawa in time to meet your buddies on the beach.
So, why don't you stop screwing with me?
Give me a damn name.
Gangway!
Gangway!
Let's go, let's go!
Gangway!
Where the hell is that son-of-a-bitch?
Hayes!
Hayes?
Hayes, get your red ass over here!
Make me look like I don't know what my own men are doing with a flag the size of my mother's house?
God damn it, Ira, you shouldn't have lied to me.
You made me look like a complete asshole.
We're gonna miss you around here.
Good luck.
Now your name's in the paper, too.
Just heard your doctor say we're postponing your operation.
You're being shipped back to the mainland.
Everybody who saw that picture thought planting the flag meant victory.
That's all they wanted to know.
Victory.
Within a few weeks of that picture being taken, half the men in it were dead.
Mrs. Hansen!
Mrs. Hansen!
Did you know Hank was a hero?
-Are you proud of him, Mrs. Hansen?
-What was he like as a boy?
Look this way, please, ma'am.
What do you have to say about your son?
But somehow being a part of it meant something.
Looking at it, you could believe their sacrifice was not a waste.
Yeah, I might have thought that was Harlon, too.
It is.
Belle, their names are right here.
It's not him.
And he would be alive and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.
You think about that when you look at his picture, Ed.
And I need to rush home and change because there's the Governor's banquet and then there's the parade.
Imagine, the Governor is coming here to meet us.
Now, I'm wearing blue so, if...
-Are you going to change?
-We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin from CBS World News.
A press association has just announced that President Roosevelt is dead.
The President died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
All we know so far is that the President died at Warm Springs in Georgia.
Further updates every hour.
Temperatures will remain the same today, in the mid-30s to low 40s with clear skies.
Hello?
Yes.
Of course.
No, we understand.
It wouldn't be right.
Thank you.
Here he is, gentlemen.
Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.
Senator Haddigan.
I'd like you to meet Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Damn good to meet you.
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.
Sorry?
That's Pima Indian talk, boy, don't you know your own language?
Took forever to memorize the damn gibberish.
Sorry, I've been away from the reservation too long, Senator.
-Doc.
-Ira.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
-That's you.
-Go, go, go, go.
Go.
Please welcome
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley,
Private First Class Ira Hayes,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon!
Holy shit.
Come in, come in, come in.
Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.
-Rene Gagnon.
-Bud Gurber.
-You showing the boys the sights?
-We saw a hell of a ball game.
That's great.
The bar's there, help yourself.
I got some briefing sheets for you here, just some simple things we want you to say.
Mostly, "Buy bonds," can't say that too often.
Itineraries, those are changing every couple minutes.
Everybody wants to meet you guys.
I got women sending up envelopes with stockings in them, notes written in lipstick.
We won't mention that to the press, am I right?
Have a drink, for Christ's sake.
My God, what you boys must have seen over there.
I've been watching the newsreels.
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.
So, we got a hell of a lot of money to raise, not a lot of time.
White House tomorrow, then we trot you over to shake hands with a couple of hundred Congressmen who won't pull a penny out of their pockets.
Politicians and actors.
You put them in a restaurant together, they'd die of old age before picking up the check.
Then New York City, Times Square, dinners with various hoi polloi, then Chicago...
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?
That's what we're calling the mothers of the dead flag-raisers.
You present each mother with a flag, they say a few words, people will shit money.
It'll be so moving.
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.
Lovely woman.
She knows how close you and her son were.
He wrote home about you.
She is very, very much looking forward to meeting you.
Hank wasn't in the picture.
Sorry?
Hank didn't raise that flag.
He raised the other one, the real flag.
The what?
The real...
The real flag?
There's a real flag?
Yeah, ours was the replacement flag.
We put it up when they took the other one down.
Am I the only one getting a headache here?
You know about this?
It was after it was already in the papers.
The mothers had already been told, but...
That's it, that's beautiful.
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Yeah, why tell me?
I'm only the guy that has to explain it to 150 million Americans.
Who is in the goddamn picture?
Are any of you guys in the goddamn picture?
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.
Six guys raising a flag over lwo Jima.
Victory is ours.
You're three of them, right?
This was the fifth day, sir.
The battle went on for 35 more.
Well, what'd you do, raise a goddamn flag every time you stopped for lunch?
Can I hit this guy?
You know what, I don't give a shit, you're in the picture, you raised the flag, that's the story we're selling, boys.
Are you deaf?
Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?
Harlon Block.
That's whose mother should be here if anyone's should be.
You know, I think this whole damn thing is a farce, you ask me.
You know what they're calling this bond drive?
The Mighty Seventh.
They might've called it the
"We're Flat Fucking Broke And Can't Even Afford Bullets
"So We're Begging For Your Pennies" bond drive, but it didn't have quite the ring.
They could've called it that, though, because the last four bond drives came up so short we just printed money instead.
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street, he'll tell you our dollar is next to worthless, we borrowed so much.
And nobody is lending any more.
Ships aren't being built.
Tanks aren't being built.
Machine guns, bazookas, hand grenades, zip.
You think this is a farce?
You want to go back to your buddies?
Well, stuff some rocks in your pockets before you get on the plane because that's all we got left to throw at the Japanese.
And don't be surprised if your plane doesn't make it off the runway because the fuel dumps are empty.
And our good friends, the Arabs, are only taking bullion.
If we don't raise $14 billion, and that's million with a "B," this war is over by the end of the month.
We make a deal with the Japanese, we give whatever they want and we come home, because you've seen them fight, and they sure as shit ain't giving up.
$14 billion.
The last three drives didn't make that much all together.
People on the street corners, they looked at this picture and they took hope.
Don't ask me why, I think it's a crappy picture myself.
You can't even see your faces.
But it said we can win this war, are winning this war, we just need you to dig a little deeper.
They want to give us that money.
No, they want to give it to you.
But you, you don't want to ask for it.
You don't want to give them hope.
You want to explain about this person and that flag.
Well, that's your choice.
Because if we admit we made a mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about and that will be that.
Gentlemen.
Mr. President, here they are.
-Well, hello.
Good to see you.
-Mr.
President.
Darn good to see you, boys.
Heard you had a hell of a fight on your hands out there, hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation in Arizona, am I right?
Yes, Mr. President.
Being an Indian, you are a truer American than any of us.
Bet your people are proud to see you wear that uniform.
Very proud, sir.
They should be.
Well, I want to thank you for coming all this way to Washington to help us out.
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific now we need you to fight for a mountain of cash.
-And I don't expect you'll let us down.
-No, sir.
Good.
Go get it.
That's the end of this ceremony.
Let's take a look at this famous photo over here, see if I can pick you out.
My gosh.
There you are.
Boys.
Boys, this one's on me.
To those who can't be with us.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon.
May we have your autograph?
I suppose.
And your name is?
I don't know about you, but I get the impression
I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.
You're such a hero.
I feel honored to be in your presence.
That's just not true.
That's professional work.
Here, to professionals.
Here they are.
You're the guys in the photograph, right?
I heard you were on the train.
Let me shake your hands, John Tennack.
John Bradley.
These boys are with me, Harvard and Yale types, didn't fight a lick.
Pappies all rich sons-of-bitches.
Boys, shake hands with some real war heroes.
Excuse me for one moment.
You can buy them a drink while you're at it.
That's right.
Drinks for these men all the way around.
And you're the other one, aren't you?
John Tennack, Tennack Homes.
-Rene Gagnon.
-Pleased to meet you.
Have a drink, come on.
And here's my card.
Listen to me, Rene, when you get finished being famous you come see me because if you can sell bonds, you can sell homes.
Now, they're not gonna build homes anymore, they're gonna deliver them.
-You heard of prefab homes?
-No, sir.
Well, you will.
And you hang on to that card and you come see me, you hear?
-All right?
-Certainly will.
All right.
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?
If Mike and the guys could see us.
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it, would they?
Harlon!
Franklin!
Can you imagine Franklin on this train
eating at the dining car with all the silver?
We shouldn't be here, Doc.
There's gonna be a Hallelujah Day
When the boys have all come home to stay
And a million bands begin to play
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
And when we've lit the torch of liberty
In each blacked-out land across the sea
Ira!
Hey, Ira!
We heard the picture was posed!
What?
We heard you posed the picture!
Hey, Doc!
We're bigger than life, Doc!
And we'll heave a mighty sigh
When each gal can kiss the boy she kissed goodbye
And they'll come marching down Fifth Avenue
The United Nations in review
When this lovely dream has all come true
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
Good job.
Thank you.
Thank you, girls!
And now, here are the men you've been waiting to meet, the men in white.
Right behind me here, the heroes of Iwo Jima,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon,
Private First Class Ira Hayes, and Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley!
Thank you.
It's good of you people to come out tonight in support of the war effort.
We really need you to buy bonds, that's for sure.
'Cause we can't win the war without your help.
As far as us being the heroes of Iwo Jima, that's just not the case.
We really didn't do much at all.
Especially him.
Especially me.
I was just a runner.
That's it.
We put up a flag.
The pole we attached it to was heavy, so it took a number of us.
We had our picture taken doing it.
The real heroes are dead on that island.
And we'd appreciate it if you bought bonds in honor of them.
Thank you.
Jump on any grenades, Ira?
Take out any machine gun nests I missed?
At least I fired my weapon.
All right, knock it off.
You hit anything or were you too drunk then, too?
What?
Guys!
Come on!
Stop it.
Knock it off.
The tall man with the high hat will be coming down your way
Get your savings out when you hear him shout
"Any bonds today?"
Any bonds today?
Bonds of freedom that's what I'm selling
Any bonds today?
Rene, right here.
Sit between these two boys.
Here comes the freedom man
Asking you to buy a share of freedom today ...for us and they need our help.
And, if you think about it, I think you'll realize that buying more bonds is not just the right thing to do but the only thing to do.
Yes, this war has gone on too long.
We have given too many lives.
And its cost...
-Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
-Strawberry.
...has been far too high.
But if we waver now, if we don't dig deep and give more than we think we can then those sacrifices would be wasted...
Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
...and those lives lost in vain.
Let's move!
Go, go!
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over.
Where the hell are our tanks?
Stuck in the sand.
Captain says you're to go without them.
Christ.
That's real good work you're doing there, Rene.
All right, prepare to move out.
Pass the word.
Second Platoon!
Move!
Move!
Move!
All right, Second Platoon, on your feet!
Let's move out!
Jackass.
Let's move out!
Go, go!
Move, move, move!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Second Platoon, move out!
Doc!
Doc, get out of there!
Corpsman!
Doc!
Doc, get the hell out of there!
May I have your attention, please.
Train number 48 with service from New York City, Boston,
Rochester, New York,
Toledo, Ohio, and South Bend, Indiana is now arriving on Track 7.
Train number 48 now arriving on Track number 7.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.
-Come on, boys.
-Let's go.
-Watch your step, ma'am.
-Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the heroes of Iwo Jima.
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.
Private First Class Ira Hayes.
And Private First Class Rene Gagnon.
Rene!
That's my boyfriend!
Who the hell is that?
I don't know.
-Rene, is that your girl?
-Hey, what do they call you?
How about a photo?
Hey, look at that!
What's your name, doll?
What's your name?
Hey, she's a beauty.
Let's go find a saloon.
Smile, boys.
Give them their money's worth.
Hey, Doc, how's the tour going for you?
Thank you.
Where exactly are you staying?
-I'm not sure yet.
-Just forget about that.
Senator, I'd like you to meet Corpsman John Bradley.
-Doc, right?
-Yes, sir.
Nice to meet you, Senator.
Good to meet you, young man.
Now, we appreciate everything you've done and everything you're doing.
-Thank you, sir.
-Quite all right.
This is Captain White.
-Colonel Johns.
-We're proud of you, Corpsman.
And then Colonel McCourtney.
-Major General Green.
-Nice to meet you.
Senator, this is Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Of course!
Now I hear you used a tomahawk on those Japs.
Is that true, Chief?
No, sir.
Well, tell them you did, makes a better story, huh?
-Attaboy.
-This is Captain Green.
John?
Madeline Evelley.
I recognize you from all the photographs.
I'm Hank's mom.
It's so nice to meet you, ma'am.
Hank was always talking about you.
This is PFC Rene Gagnon.
Pleasure to meet you, son.
Thanks for everything.
-My pleasure.
-Not at all.
Ira, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Strank, Mike's mom.
It's all right.
When I got the telegram, I...
I don't know what I'm trying to say here.
Knowing he was with you that day and seeing him in that photograph,
I don't know why it makes me feel better, but it does.
-It's so silly, isn't it?
-No, it's not.
How are you, son?
Thank you very much.
We're the largest furniture wholesaler in Illinois.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
-I'll make sure he calls.
-Well, thank you.
Thank you.
Are you Rene?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Franklin's mother.
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.
I'm Pauline, Rene's girlfriend.
Would you mind?
Paper said that's Hank, and I honestly can't tell.
It's horrible of a mother not to know her own son, isn't it?
But that's him, isn't it?
Well, to be honest, ma'am, it happened so quick, and with everything that was going on it's kind of hard to remember who was where.
But...
Yeah, I think...
I think that's where he was.
That's Hank.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Excuse us.
Take him outside.
I'm Pauline.
-Very nice to meet you.
-Hi, nice to meet you.
He was the best Marine I ever knew.
Thank you.
-You okay, Chief?
-Oh, Christ!
I'm okay.
Yeah, you look it.
You're gonna screw this up, aren't you?
You're gonna screw it up for all of us.
I've got him.
Get some sleep, Ira.
-Mike?
-Yeah?
-You see this?
-What?
-Mike!
-Oh, shit, go!
He's killing me!
Hey, Doc, you think they got them all?
What?
Well, they're not shooting at us.
Maybe we killed them all.
Or they ran off in the night or something.
Or they're waiting for us to start climbing.
Third Platoon!
Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.
-Just us?
-Yeah, just us, lgg.
All right, Third Platoon, move!
I tag along?
Yeah, you can lead the way if you want.
Get a good shot of my face.
It's your ass I'm gonna make famous, Hank.
Hey, that'll work for me, too.
Lieutenant, if you make it to the top, put this up.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, Iggy.
They never shoot at the first patrol.
-They don't?
-No.
They want us to go up to the top, signal to the others that it's okay, then shoot everybody else as they come up the mountain.
-Really?
-Yeah.
Unless of course they want to make an example of us and discourage all the others.
I think you're full of crap, you know that, Hank?
Really?
Jesus.
Thank God that ain't us.
Told you.
Boots, spread them out and put them on a line.
Set up a perimeter!
First Squad!
-Hank?
Find me a pole.
-Yeah.
Let's put this flag up.
Watch it.
Right over here.
Right here.
That's good.
That's good.
Right here, right here.
Got that end?
Hold that steady.
Lindberg.
-Hey, who's got rope?
-Right here.
Give me something.
Yeah, good.
That work?
Do it, fellas.
Keep it coming.
USMC!
USMC!
Shit, look at that!
Jeez, look at that.
Get down!
Take cover!
Cover with that .30!
-Watch it!
Twenty yards down, Hank!
-You see them?
-I got about 20 yards, left side.
-Lindberg, get the flamethrower!
-Boots, you see them?
-Cover right!
-About 20 yards down!
Duck one!
-You see them?
Keep the cover on!
Second Squad, you see them?
Get me some grenades!
I see them!
You see them?
Right flank, over to the right!
Cover me, I'm going down!
Careful, Iggy.
Easy.
All clear!
Okay, guys, who wants to be famous?
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
-God damn it.
Strank!
-Sir?
They want a phone line run up to the top of the mountain.
Let me guess, they picked us.
Second Platoon, let's go.
Get some exercise.
Let's go!
Get off your ass.
Oh, shit!
Hope it still works, 'cause you're not getting mine!
-Get Forrestal!
-All right, then.
I don't know whose idea it was, Mr. Secretary.
Well, it was goddamn brilliant.
I want that flag, Holland.
Mark my words, raising that son-of-a-bitch means a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.
I want that flag.
Yes, sir.
I'll make sure no one touches it.
You can count on me.
Fuck that.
That flag belongs to the men in this battalion.
That son-of-a-bitch thinks that our men died taking this ground so we could hand over our flag to some politician to pin to his wall?
He's out of his goddamn mind!
Get me that flag, and find another one to replace it.
You've gotta be shitting me.
Gagnon!
Get your ass over here.
Hey.
Hi, fellas.
How's it going?
Missed a beautiful shot, Joe.
It's that kind of day.
-Hey, Mike.
-Hell of a view, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant!
Captain says he wants that flag.
He wants this flag?
Yes, sir.
-We just put the damn thing up.
-Yes, sir.
Some kind of flag shortage?
He wants you to put this one up instead.
Hey, Mike.
Do me a favor and put this up, will you?
Yes, sir.
All right, let's find a pole.
Take the flag down, boys.
Captain's orders.
You heard him, let's do it.
There you go.
Lordy, she's a heavy one.
All right, hang on.
Put this on.
One hell of a view, huh?
Good view from up here.
Yes, I'd say so myself.
All right.
-Not in your way here, am I, Joe?
-Nah, I'm fine, thanks.
Hey, Doc, you wanna give us a hand here?
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.
Ready?
Ready?
Let's go.
You get it?
I don't know.
I wish I could've seen their faces.
Nobody even noticed that second flag going up.
Everybody saw that damn picture and made up their own story about it.
But your dad and the others knew what they had done and what they had not done.
All your friends dying, it's hard not to be called a hero for saving somebody's life.
But for putting up a pole?
You gotta be kidding.
Hey!
It took a lot of talented folks a long time to make that thing.
Just wait till tonight when it's lit properly and there's thousands of cheering people in the stands.
It's gonna look a lot better.
So, stadium lights come down, spotlight comes up and you get your cue.
You charge up this thing with the flag, you plant it at the top.
You smile, you wave.
You know the drill.
You want us to plant the flag on a pile of papier-mâché.
Hey, that's show biz.
And try and stand how you stood the first time you planted it.
Just, you know, pretend the other three guys are with you.
The dead guys.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, not a problem.
Good.
But where do we imagine Hank is standing?
Sorry?
Well, seeing that he wasn't there, it'll be kind of hard for us to leave a space for him.
I think you know exactly where he was.
You pointed him out to his mother.
This is bullshit.
I planted that damn thing once, and I'm not doing it again.
-Hayes!
-Oh, for Christ's sake.
Hayes.
Hayes, get your ass back here or you're going on report.
Hayes!
You wanna do your damn job?
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Come on!
He's with me!
Hey, he's with me!
-Back off!
-Sir, he's with me.
Okay?
He's with me.
Ira, put the goddamn chair down!
-Put the chair down, son!
-Put the chair down, Ira!
Tell them drop their sticks!
Ira, they're cops, they're supposed to have nightsticks.
You're not supposed to be in the street swinging a chair.
-Calm down, son.
-Sir, turn around, please.
That poster right there?
The one on the end, that's him.
-That's him?
-Yes, sir.
You read the papers?
Christ.
We got another fucking hero.
Get him out of here.
-Can you do that?
-Yes, sir.
Put the goddamn chair down.
And let's go.
Did you start this?
He didn't serve me!
I don't make the rules.
We don't serve Indians.
He needs to go sleep it off.
Soldier Field.
You hear that?
What the hell is that?
I can't figure it out.
Keep an eye out.
It sounds like it's coming from up there.
They're using grenades.
They're killing themselves.
Ira, let's go.
Come on.
Let's go, Ira.
Come on.
Thank God.
Jesus.
Look at you, Chief.
You found him.
Holy shit.
You would have to pick today.
Vandegrift is here with enough brass to start a fucking band.
Come on, let's go.
Can you walk?
-Yes, sir.
-By yourself?
All right, look.
I don't care if you have to carry him get him to the top, plant that flag, and don't fucking fall off.
Get him in his stuff.
I'll stall these guys for as long as I can.
Hurry up.
Jesus Christ.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Cover!
Harlon!
Harlon!
Get your fire team up in that position!
O'Hare!
First Fire Team!
Work around!
BAR, you, on the side of the ridge!
Covering fire, boys, go, go, go!
Jackson, work your team around to the left!
Cover!
Left flank!
Left flank!
Franklin, Gust, go check it out!
Hustle up, boys!
We got them!
Clear!
One hell of an experience.
Move out!
Cease fire!
They're my men!
You're targeting our men!
You're targeting our...
Get me another radio!
Sergeant?
Sergeant!
Mike!
Mike, Mike, Mike.
Mike?
Mike.
Hey, where's Doc?
Corpsman!
Oh, shit.
How's his breathing?
Harlon, move, buddy.
Hey, Mike.
Mike, Mike, can you hear us?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on, Mike.
Mike?
Mike, can you hear us?
All right, let's go!
Move out!
I'm gonna get a stretcher.
Let's take him down, move him off the beach.
Ladies and gentlemen, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Corpsman!
Hank!
Hank!
Doc, they killed me.
Harlon!
Doc, they killed me.
Come on, Harlon.
Harlon, stay with me.
Franklin!
I'm fine, Ira.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
-Where'd he go?
-Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
-I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
-I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Does it open?
Iggy!
Iggy!
Iggy, are you down there?
Iggy!
Can't tell who it is, but he's one of ours.
I had to go outside to throw up.
Look what they did to the poor son-of-a-bitch.
You okay, Chief?
Just let it go.
If that doesn't pry open their wallets, nothing will.
Jesus Christ, he's drunk.
Goddamn Indians.
Come on, Chief.
Let's get you home.
That's not what I hear.
I called around, I'm not stupid.
He's been drunk since he started this damn tour, making a spectacle of himself.
Just about choked that poor woman at the reception, blubbering.
Jesus Christ, you're supposed to be watching these men.
Yes, sir.
Well, he's making us look like regular asses.
Well, with all due respect, sir, he never wanted to come on this trip in the first place.
We had to pull him, kicking and screaming, off that boat.
He wants to be with his unit.
What unit?
They're all fucking dead.
This is how he honors those men?
By drinking and throwing up, and...
You know what?
He wants it, great, we'll send him back.
Get him packed and on a train today.
He's an embarrassment to the uniform.
Yes, sir.
I'll do it.
Yeah, no, that's...
That's good.
That's what I want.
I know it's a good thing, raising the money and that, 'cause we need it.
But,
I can't take them calling me a hero.
All I did was try not to get shot.
Some of the things I saw done, things I did,
they weren't things to be proud of, you know?
Mike...
Mike was a hero.
You ever meet him?
No.
Best Marine I ever met.
You know, Chief, I think if Mike was sitting here instead of you he'd be saying the same thing about himself,
not being a hero.
Maybe.
He was a good guy.
But I think that he would be ashamed of me, seeing me the way I am.
Think I could see my ma before they ship me off?
Think they'd do that?
See my ma?
I'm sorry, Ira.
We got stories now to tell our kids, I guess.
Keep your head down.
All aboard.
Good luck, Chief.
I think I saw him once after that.
It was maybe six or seven years after the war.
I was working as a salesman, doing a lot of driving.
I was driving west across Texas.
I was just trying to get where I was going so I could get home.
And I saw this guy hitchhiking on the side of the road.
And, for a second, I thought it might've been him.
I always regret that I didn't stop, but I was in a hurry.
And he was an Indian.
We always told the press that Ira insisted that he was going back to fight with his unit which was at least partially true, but
that isn't what got the headlines.
We're engaged.
Excuse me a minute, darling.
-Hey, Doc?
-Yeah?
-Got a minute?
-Yeah.
I'll see you at the car.
-You hear I'm getting married?
-I did, Rene.
That's great.
Yeah, it's something she wants.
She waited for me all this time.
She's not used to all this, but she's a good girl.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
So, I was wondering if you'd be my best man.
Me?
Don't you have somebody at home, a buddy, you'd rather ask?
Well, I didn't really make many.
The ones who didn't go, it's...
Well, it's hard to even talk to them.
You know?
Yeah, I know.
I'd be proud to.
Thank you.
I better go drag her away from them before she announces
I'm gonna be president of General Motors or something.
All right.
-Congratulations.
-Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Rene, you're a lucky man.
-Big smile, Mrs. Gagnon!
-Say cheese!
I couldn't complain because the press loved them, so they wrote more articles and people bought more bonds.
The tour went on with just Rene and your dad.
And the true heroes are the men who didn't make it home from lwo Jima, the men who died at Iwo Jima and in other campaigns.
We ask that you honor the memory of those men by buying the war bonds and helping us to win this war.
Thank you.
City after city, I thought the damn thing'd never end.
And this rumor kept going around that the photograph had been staged.
I remember your dad telling them that he wished he'd known he was having his picture taken because he would've ducked the hell out of it.
Whose idea was it?
Who wanted to stage the thing?
Come on, it was you?
Was there truth to the rumor that that picture was staged, Doc?
-Come on!
Doc?
-Can you answer that?
I remember when your dad got shot.
All hell was busting loose.
People back home saw that picture and thought it was over when we took Suribachi.
We wished.
Anyways, we're pinned down.
Mortars, shells, machine guns.
Fire coming from every which direction, right?
And we hear somebody call, "Corpsman down."
Corpsman down!
Blood was spurting out of his throat, and Doc was doing everything he could.
And the Corpsman looks up at him and he knows what this means, to be shot in the neck.
He knows he's dying, you can see that.
But still in his eyes, he's pleading with Doc to save his life.
And Doc can't.
-You okay, Doc?
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-Yeah, you look fine.
-I'm okay.
Keep down, all right?
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.
Okay.
Corpsman.
Corpsman!
For God sake, Corpsman!
Corpsman?
Corpsman.
Incoming!
Let me see.
It's not that bad.
You're gonna be okay.
All right?
Just stay with me.
Look at me.
Took us a half-hour to find your dad.
He could've bled to death.
Coming down.
Thanks.
Vets'll tell you about being hit but not wanting to leave their buddies.
Usually, they're lying.
You'll take any excuse to get out of there.
But it happens.
You get the feeling you're letting them down.
I could see that in your dad's face.
He wanted to go, he'd seen enough.
But he didn't want to leave us.
Now, he was a hell of a good man, your dad.
Yeah.
While we were sitting there on the beach, we heard this great roar.
And we looked up.
That was the first of thousands of landings on Iwo.
-Look at that.
-Yeah.
How about that.
I'm gonna head back, all right?
Good luck.
That island saved a lot of lives.
A lot of lives.
I don't know what else to tell you.
After the bond tour my dad finally got his operation.
By the time he got home the war was over.
First thing he did was ask my mom to marry him.
Ira tried to get on with his life and put it all behind him.
Thank you for having me here today.
It's an honor to be in front of such a strong people.
Because of the war white men will understand Indians a lot better.
And it's going to be a better world.
But life had other plans for him.
You're...
You're him, aren't you?
You're the hero, right?
Great.
All right, kids, go get your picture taken.
Oh, that's great.
That's great.
All right, now say cheese.
Cheese!
That's great!
Okay.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Thanks.
-Come on.
-That's a hero, kids.
Hero, lift this basket, will you?
It's too heavy for me.
Rene tried to take advantage of those offers he'd received on the bond tour.
Yes.
G-A-G-N-O-N.
Right.
Pronounced Rene.
Rene, yes.
-Okay, I actually called last week.
-Yes.
Okay, yes.
Mr. Gagnon.
I gave Mr. Tennack your message.
I'm sure he'll call you.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
But he was yesterday's hero.
He even applied for a job at the local police station.
They said he wasn't qualified.
After working the factory with Pauline he tried a few things but spent the rest of his life as a janitor.
But Ira...
Ira!
You got a visitor.
Ira always made the news.
I could never find out why he did it, but one day Ira just took off.
He walked and hitched over 1,300 miles from Arizona to Texas.
He found Harlon Block's father working his field.
His wife, Belle, had left him soon after they discovered Harlon died.
She never forgave him for letting her son go off to war.
And Ira told him the truth, that it had been his son who raised the flag with them, his son in the photograph.
And then he just turned and walked away.
Though the flag-raising meant nothing to him, he somehow knew it would mean everything to them.
Thanks for calling.
Just as Belle knew all along.
The press soon found out and called Hank's mom with the news that it wasn't her son after all.
The last time they all saw each other was at the unveiling of the Marine Corps War Memorial.
And even though he planted the first flag above lwo Jima,
Hank's mother and father weren't invited.
Ira.
It's good to see you, Ira.
Hell of a statue.
It wasn't long after that that they found Ira.
The papers said he died of exposure.
There was no autopsy.
It was about that same time when my father got in his car early one morning telling my mom he had something to do.
He drove to a town on the other side of Wisconsin where Iggy's mom lived.
Ever since she heard the news about her son she'd been trying to find out how he died, and no one would tell her.
I never found out what he told her, but I can pretty much guarantee it wasn't the truth.
My mother would ask him what was troubling him.
He would never say.
And every year, as it got close to Memorial Day, the reporters would start calling asking to interview my father.
No, I'm sorry.
He's fishing in Canada.
We were always instructed to say the same thing.
Okay.
Thanks.
When Mr. McCandless retired, my father bought the funeral home where he'd worked since coming home.
He spent the rest of his life running the business and raising his family.
He never spoke about the war or about the flag-raising, never told us anything.
The first time I heard any of these stories was after he died.
Where is he?
Oh, God.
He's not here, Dad.
He died.
Who?
Who died?
Iggy.
Iggy.
Christ, poor lggy.
I hadn't thought of him for years.
How do you know about Iggy?
You were calling for him, when you collapsed.
I wasn't looking for Iggy.
I was looking for you.
I wanted to...
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry I wasn't a better father.
Talked to you more.
I just...
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
You were the best father a man could have.
Did I ever tell you they took us swimming?
No, Dad.
After we planted the flag, we came down off the mountain and they let us swim.
It was the funniest thing.
All this fighting and we were jumping around in the water like kids.
That's the way I remember lggy now.
I finally came to the conclusion that maybe he was right.
Maybe there's no such thing as heroes.
Maybe there are just people like my dad.
I finally came to understand why they were so uncomfortable being called heroes.
Heroes are something we create, something we need.
It's a way for us to understand what is almost incomprehensible, how people could sacrifice so much for us.
But for my dad and these men, the risks they took, the wounds they suffered, they did that for their buddies.
They may have fought for their country, but they died for their friends.
For the man in front, for the man beside them.
And if we wish to truly honor these men, we should remember them the way they really were, the way my dad remembered them.
Come on, Doc!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
For God's sakes!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
What's wrong?
Every jackass thinks he knows what war is.
Especially those who have never been in one.
We like things nice and simple:
Good and evil, heroes and villains.
There's always plenty of both.
Most of the time, they are not who we think they are.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where, where is he?
Mr. Bradley?
Mr. B?
You okay?
- Where is he?
- Where is who?
Where is he?
Where did he go?
Where, where is he?
All right.
Just stay right here, okay?
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
It'll be okay.
Where is he?
Most guys I knew would never talk about what happened over there.
Probably because they're still trying to forget about it.
They certainly didn't think of themselves as heroes.
They died without glory.
Nobody has taken their pictures.
Only their buddies knew what they did.
I'd tell their folks they died for their country.
I'm not sure that was it.
Now, there were plenty other photos taken that day but none anybody wanted to see.
What we see and do in war the cruelty, is unbelievable.
But somehow we gotta make some sense of it.
To do that, we need an easy-to-understand truth and damn few words.
Film's ruined.
I don't know.
This one looks all right.
And if you can get a picture...
Now, the right picture can win or lose a war.
You're gonna want to see this.
Look at Vietnam.
The picture of that South Vietnamese officer blowing that fella's brains out of the side of his head.
That was it.
The war was lost.
We just hung around trying to pretend it wasn't.
Took a lot of other pictures that day.
None of them made a difference.
Thanks.
Appreciate it.
Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.
Country was bankrupt.
People were becoming cynical and tired of war.
- Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon!
- Where?
Right there.
Planting that flag, that's your brother.
Ma, all you can see is his behind.
And that's his.
I powdered and diapered it, I know my son.
That's him.
Go get your father.
Daddy, Ma's got a picture of Harlon's keister in the paper.
You watch your mouth, young man.
Thank you.
One photo, almost all on its own, turned that around.
It's on the front page of every major paper.
Over 200 dailies and they're all flooded with requests for prints.
I think we might have found it.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- I gotta go get him.
- Oh, no, you don't.
Iggy, I gotta go.
I have a whole different theory.
He wants medical attention, he'll come to us.
Hey, shut up and crawl over here, you lazy son of a bitch!
- As soon as that flare goes out.
- Crap.
- Okay, well, I'll go with you.
- No.
- You're gonna leave me here?
- I'll be right back, just-
Shoot some people.
I gotta go.
Oh, God.
Okay, it's okay.
Don't touch them.
Get your hands out, let me do that.
Don't look.
Keep your head back, your eyes on me.
Look at me.
I'll get it.
I'll take care of it.
We'll get this bandage on you.
We'll get you taken care of.
And we'll get you down to the bottom, all right?
You're gonna be fine.
It's okay.
I'll do that.
I'll do that.
Put some pressure on that.
Put your hands on top and put pressure on it.
Keep your head back.
Keep breathing.
Keep looking at me, all right?
Just keep looking at-
Doc.
Help me.
Help me.
How does that feel?
- It feels good.
- It does?
All right.
- Good.
- All right.
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.
I'll be right back.
I'm all right.
Go and help someone who's hurt.
All right.
Hold on there.
- Where did he go?
- Who?
- The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
- You jumped in the wrong hole.
I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
Shut up.
You want every Jap shooting at us?
Iggy!
Holy shit.
They expect us to climb this?
Or something just like it.
So where you think they're sending us?
I think it's the desert, Franklin.
Well, that makes no sense at all.
Well, it's just military psychology.
They always train you for the desert on a volcano.
Now you're just having fun with me.
Harlon, take your men right.
Watch for Bedouins.
- What's a Bedouin?
- It's a guy with a camel.
Well, jeez Louise, maybe we are going to the desert.
Now, you tilt that to the right, but what if the bullet comes from the left?
Bullets don't come from the left.
You know any left-handed Japs?
That makes as much sense as you showering with your shoes on.
You don't even know why you do it, do you?
Because I don't tell you mean I don't know?
You do it because Mike does it.
I'll ask him.
- So you cut hair back home?
- Some.
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?
No, I just studied it a little.
- But not in barber school?
- Nope.
Let me guess, Hayes is winning.
Chief, I had very little to do with Sitting Bull's death so maybe you could stop taking it out on me.
Different tribe.
The Pimas fought on the side of the white man.
- See, now that's smart.
- That is smart.
Yeah.
Worked real good for us.
Good luck, fellas.
Hey, good night, Lindberg.
Dead bodies.
He cuts hair on dead bodies.
Even I knew that.
- Who's in?
- Oh, I'm in.
It must be a lot easier with them not moving around and all.
There's that.
You know what I been thinking?
Well, they been telling us we need to buddy up and I think we'd make pretty good buddies.
And how do you figure that?
Well, you know, in that we have a lot in common.
So why do you cut dead people's hair, anyway?
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.
You tell a lot of people that?
You actually chose the Marines because they got the best uniform?
No sense being a hero if you don't look like one.
Jacks.
Queens.
Shit.
Do anything on that reservation but play cards, chief?
All right, listen up, you sorry bunch of leathernecks!
We going over the side tomorrow which means we ain't long for this rock.
- All right!
- About time.
Any man who doesn't have his masturbation papers in order get them signed by tomorrow or he ain't going.
- I got mine already.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm square.
Wait.
Why am I just hearing about this?
I don't have to repeat everything twice for you.
No, I didn't hear nothing about no masturbating papers.
Heard they were running short.
You know, nobody tells me nothing.
That's real nice, guys.
All right, get over to the officer in charge of records.
Maybe he's got more.
- Leave your smokes.
I'll play for you.
- Thanks, Mike.
Listen, he calls you an idiot, you take it like a man, okay?
Just do not leave without signing them.
- I appreciate it, sergeant.
- You got it.
What the hell happened to your hair, Rene?
Look like a goddamn corpse.
Three points of contact on that rope at all times.
Next four.
Over the side.
Let's go.
Keep moving.
Next four, over the side.
Keep your eye on the guy below you.
That's all you gotta look at.
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.
Keep three points of contact on the rope at all times.
You see?
No big thing.
Just one step at a time and keep your hands on the vertical rope.
Once you're in the boat, move away.
Make sure you keep three points of contact on the rope.
- I got him!
- All right, get that man out of the water.
Give me a hand.
- Don't worry about him, Doc.
- All right, quit skylarking!
Keep moving.
He'll be fine.
Our target, Island X is an ugly, smelly, dirty little scab of rock called Iwo Jima.
It means Sulfur Island, which accounts for the smell.
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop, you ask me.
After 20 straight days of bombing you won't find a blade of grass or a twig on it.
It wasn't that pretty to start with.
Captain?
Iwo's just five and a half miles long, two and a half wide.
There's a lump down at the bottom.
That's Mount Suribachi.
On the maps in front of you the island is white.
Not much of it.
The black dots represent known enemy emplacements.
Coastal defense guns, dual-mount dual- purpose guns, covered artillery.
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes, and earth-covered structures.
I don't see any barracks or any other structures.
That's right.
And we still don't know why.
Now, this isn't just any island to them.
This isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, or Saipan.
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders in eight square miles.
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.
It's up to us to convince them.
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.
The 8th Ammo Company will land here to resupply.
The Suribachi's guns are the problem.
They can hit any point on the island.
We're sitting ducks until we take them out.
That's our job.
We cut across the island at the base, slit its throat, lop off its head.
And we take that mountain.
We take that mountain, we take their big guns.
We take their eyes.
Okay, I'm heading in.
Follow me.
Let's put a good show on for the Marines.
Close it up.
Take it right down to the deck.
Yeah, boys!
Man overboard portside!
See him?
- Throw me a line!
- He's right there.
- Where is he?
- Watch out, watch out, watch out.
Hawaii's that way!
Just keep paddling, Mac, we'll catch you on the way back!
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!
They're not gonna stop.
What?
None of them are.
They can't.
So much for "no man left behind."
- Sir.
- Come on in.
Look, I've had to make a few other changes.
I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
- You bet.
Trouble is, I already told my men I'd see them through this.
That your James Cagney impersonation?
Because I've heard better.
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.
This isn't your first time.
You don't need to prove anything.
No, sir.
You're not the best sergeant, you're just the best one that's still walking.
- Block's a good man.
- Yes, sir, he is.
The men know him, he can step right in.
You know, I have actually thought this through.
Platoon sergeant puts you further away from the bullets.
I already gave them my word, sir.
I told them I'd bring them all home.
Which means I already lied to half of them.
Can't lie to the rest.
How are your men?
They'll do fine.
Except maybe Gagnon.
Our own Tyrone Power?
Yes, sir.
He's a good man, just might be better use further back from the lines.
I'll use him as a runner.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
Now get out of here.
Hear the good news, Doc?
We're going in with the first waves.
Hey, you do that again I'll take your head off!
Fucking dominoes.
Iggy, have you ever heard news you considered to be bad?
The first ones off the ship, Doc.
We don't go over the side of the ship.
We hop on a tractor, they drive us right there.
Oh, shit, that is good news.
You see?
What did I tell you?
What's going on?
- I'm going up to take a look.
- Let's go.
Let's go topside.
Come on!
- I'll go with you.
- Come on, come on!
What the hell?
- Let's go, let's go!
- Right behind you.
Look at that.
We're killing them!
We're killing them, Doc.
I was promised 10 days of shelling.
You're giving me three and saying that's the best you can do?
I don't give a shit!
My men hit that beach with less than 10 and I'll be taking them home to their mamas in buckets!
Yeah, I know exactly why.
Because every Navy man with a scrambled egg on his chest wants to offload us here and sail to Japan so they can be there for the big finish.
Tell their kids they captured the emperor all by themselves.
Well, you aren't going to Japan unless we take this piece-of-shit island!
These little pricks are dug in!
Okay.
Appreciate that, Jim.
Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
I'm okay.
- Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
- Jesus, Iggy, leave me alone, all right?
How about you guys?
Knife?
Bayonet?
Kick in the ass?
How about you, Doc?
Sharpen your knife?
You sharpened it three times already.
Then I better make sure I didn't nick it.
Good man, Doc.
- Hey, Doc.
- Yeah.
When we land, try not to wave this kit around too much.
They got sharpshooters trained to look for them.
They know if they take out a corpsman another dozen Marines will die unattended.
Okay, Mike.
Yeah, right there.
- Close the damn door.
For God's sake.
- Yeah, like that's gonna help.
That your girlfriend, chief?
Bet she's a pretty damn good-looking squaw.
Bet you're missing her, and that little wigwam of yours.
Welcome, all Marines off Iwo Jima.
We have a long-time wait-
It's what they do to prisoners at least the lucky ones.
Jesus.
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think about waving a white bandanna.
Poor Marines, so far from home for no good reason.
Think of your girls back home, waiting for you.
But a girl cannot stay home every night so who do you think they're with tonight?
And will she let him kiss her?
And will he comfort her at your funeral?
This sweet music is to make you think of your girls back home who are missing you.
This is all for now.
I'll see you tomorrow night.
We're clear!
Get up the berm!
Baker Company, move out!
- Seen Second Platoon?
- I don't see them.
- First squad, move out!
- God, this place reeks.
- Go, go, go!
- Move out!
Go, go, go!
Go, go!
Go!
Go, go!
Drop your packs!
Go!
All clear!
Jesus, you needed some exercise?
He got lost. 100 landing craft heading for one beach and this guy gets lost.
I'm glad we did.
Jesus, what a mess.
Any theories why they ain't shooting?
It's getting on my nerves.
Maybe they're all dead.
What do you think, Doc?
- You think they're all dead?
- Keep moving, Easy Company!
Let's go!
Mike, take six men and bring that gun onto the beach.
Second Platoon, let's move out!
Stay down.
Come on.
Move!
Move!
- Get down!
- Take cover!
Move out!
Go, go!
Get up on the beach!
Get up on the berm!
Go, go, go!
Cover fire!
Pour it on!
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!
Corpsman!
I'm gonna sling your arm and then I'll give you a shot for the pain.
Move, move!
Off the beach!
Take cover!
Dig in!
Dig in!
First Platoon!
Move, move!
You got a girl back home, Marine?
We're gonna make sure she sees you, all right?
Hey, I need pressure on this wound!
- See anything?
- Negative!
Pull that fire team up!
Where's the fire coming from?
Where are they?
Look for a flash, shoot at it!
Let's go, let's-
- Move it out!
- Move, move!
Let's go!
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!
You're over!
Third Squad, forward!
Move!
Where are they, sir?
We got ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock, pillbox!
Sergeant!
Sergeant.
I think I can clear that out.
All right, you go.
Here.
Take these.
Check your weapon.
Yeah?
Go!
Cover!
Cover him!
Cover, cover!
Son of a bitch.
- Let's go!
Go!
- Move it out!
Go, go, go!
Down, down, down!
- It's clear.
- Good work.
- I thought you said it was clear!
- It was!
Shit, I guess they're not in there firing at us then.
Lindberg!
Yeah!
Light it up!
- I'll cover you, Ice!
- Don't cover shit!
There's already enough people shooting.
One bullet and this thing goes up like a Roman candle.
Go!
Shift fire!
- Shift your fire!
- Go, go!
Shift your fire!
Go!
Go!
Hit the deck!
Stay down!
Wait for support!
Is this a bad battle or what?
- It's a fucking slaughter.
- Get down!
Corpsman!
Christ Jesus!
Get a machine gun team set up over here now!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Thank God!
Tanks!
Runner!
Get those tanks up here!
- Oh, shit.
- Man.
Get down!
Corporal, watch your left flank!
- Let's go without them!
- Let's go!
- Move out!
Move out!
- Let's go!
Let's go, move it.
Let's go!
Iggy, you gotta lift your side, he's gonna roll off.
Got it, Doc!
Incoming!
Corpsman!
- Move, move, move!
- Everybody off the LVT, now!
Give them cover fire!
Corpsman!
Keep moving!
Get that LVT up on the beach!
Keep moving!
You're next, pal, we're getting you out of here.
Move it!
Great news.
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa, because that's where we're headed.
Not you and me.
Captain Severance asked who else was in that picture.
Christ if I could remember but it was Mike and Doc and Franklin and me and Hank Hansen but I just remembered, you were there too.
I wasn't there.
Of course you were.
Neither was Hank.
He raised the first flag.
Harlon Block raised that one.
Shit.
I told them it was Hank.
If you weren't there, how'd you know it was Harlon?
- You tell them it was me?
- No.
I just remembered.
Good, keep your mouth shut.
They know there was somebody else, by the picture.
- Pick someone dead.
- They don't want somebody dead they want to ship us back to the States.
What did I tell you?
- I wasn't there.
You hear?
- All right.
Just settle down.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're not going anywhere.
You wounded, son?
No, sir.
Did you take out a nest of Japs butt-naked with your bare hands?
Because if I'm gonna give up my seat to a hero, he better have a good goddamn story to tell.
No, sir.
Then enjoy it, because they'll forget you before Christmas.
Sixth man, you got a name?
Sorry, still don't remember.
Damn shame, because I promised the major you'd know who it was.
Fact, you not knowing throws a doubt on you being one of the flag-raisers yourself.
Since no one wants to be embarrassed, the moment you land they'll turn around, ship you to Okinawa to meet your buddies on the beach.
So why don't you stop screwing with me?
Give me a damn name.
Gangway!
Gangway!
Let's go, let's go!
Gangway!
Where the hell is that son of a bitch?
Hayes!
Hayes!
Hayes, get your red ass over here!
Looks like I don't know what my men are doing with a flag the size of my mother's house?
Damn it, you shouldn't have lied to me.
Made me look like a complete asshole.
We're gonna miss you around here.
Good luck.
Now your name's in the paper too.
Just heard your doctor say we're postponing your operation.
You're being shipped back to the mainland.
Everybody who saw that picture thought planting the flag meant victory.
That's all they wanted to know.
Victory.
Within a few weeks of that picture being taken, half the men in it were dead.
Mrs. Hansen.
Mrs. Hansen.
Did you know Hank was a hero?
- Are you proud of him?
- What was he like as a boy?
- Look this way, please, ma'am.
- What do you have to say about your son?
But, somehow, being a part of it meant something.
Looking at it, you could believe their sacrifice was not a waste.
Yeah, I might have thought that was Harlon too.
It is.
Belle, their names are right here.
It's not him.
And he would be alive and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.
You think about that when you look at his picture, Ed.
And I need to rush home and change because there's the governor's banquet and then there's the parade.
Imagine, the governor is coming here to meet us.
Now, I'm wearing blue so-
We interrupt this program to bring you a news bulletin from CBS World News.
A press association has just announced that President Roosevelt is dead.
The president died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
All we know so far is that the president died at Warm Springs in Georgia.
Further updates every hour.
Temperatures will remain the same today in the mid-30s to low-40s with clear skies.
Hello?
Yes.
Of course.
No, we understand.
It wouldn't be right.
Thank you.
Here he is, gentlemen.
Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.
Senator Haddigan, I'd like you to meet Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Damn good to meet you.
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.
Sorry?
That's Pima Indian talk, don't you know your own language?
Took forever to memorize the damn gibberish.
Sorry, I've been away from the reservation too long, senator.
- Doc.
- Ira.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
- That's you.
- Go, go, go.
Please welcome...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Holy shit.
Come in, come in, come in.
Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Bud Gurber.
- Showing the boys the sights?
- Saw a hell of a ball game.
That's great.
The bar's there, help yourself.
I got some briefing sheets for you, some simple things we want you to say.
Mostly "Buy bonds." Can't say that too often.
Itineraries, those'll change every minute.
Everybody wants to meet you guys.
I got women sending up envelopes with stockings in them notes written in lipstick.
We won't mention that to the press.
Have a drink, for chrissake.
My God, what you boys must've seen over there.
I've been watching the newsreels.
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.
So we got a hell of a lot of money to raise, not much time.
White House tomorrow, then you shake hands with a few hundred congressmen who won't pull out a penny.
Politicians and actors.
Put them in a restaurant, they'd die before paying the check.
Then New York City, Times Square dinners with various hoi polloi, then Chicago.
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?
That's what we're calling the mothers of the dead flag-raisers.
You present each mother with a flag, they say a few words people will shit money.
It'll be so moving.
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.
Lovely woman.
She knows how close you and her son were.
He wrote home about you.
She is very much looking forward to meeting you.
Hank wasn't in the picture.
Sorry?
Hank didn't raise that flag.
He raised the other one, the real flag.
The what?
The real flag?
There's a real flag?
Ours was the replacement flag.
We put it up when they took the other one down.
Am I the only one getting a headache here?
You know about this?
It was after it was already in the papers.
The mothers had already been told, Bud.
That's beautiful.
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Why tell me?
I'm only the guy that has to explain it to 150 million Americans.
Who's in the goddamn picture?
Are any of you guys in the goddamn picture?
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.
Six guys raising a flag over Iwo Jima.
Victory is ours.
- You're three of them?
- This was the fifth day.
The battle went on for 35 more.
What'd you do, raise a damn flag every time you stopped for lunch?
Can I hit this guy?
I don't give a shit, you raised the flag, that's the story we're selling, boys.
Are you deaf?
Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?
Harlon Block.
That's whose mother should be here if anyone's should be.
You know, I think this whole damn thing is a farce, if you ask me.
You know what they're calling this bond drive?
The Mighty Seventh.
They might've called it the "We're Flat Broke so We're Begging for Pennies" bond drive, but it didn't have the ring.
They could've called it that because the last bond drives came so short we printed money instead.
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street our dollar is next to worthless, we borrowed so much.
And nobody is lending any more.
Ships aren't being built.
Tanks aren't being built.
Machine guns, bazookas, hand grenades, zip.
You think this is a farce?
You want to go back to your buddies?
Stuff some rocks in your pockets because that's all we got to throw at the Japanese.
And don't be surprised if your plane doesn't make it because the fuel dumps are empty.
And our good friends the Arabs are only taking bullion.
If we don't raise 14 billion dollars- And that's million with a "B."
- This war is over by the end of the month.
We give the Japanese whatever they want and we come home.
You've seen them fight, and they sure as shit ain't giving up.
Fourteen billion.
The last three drives didn't make that much altogether.
People on the street corners, they looked at this picture and they took hope.
Don't ask me why, I think it's crappy, myself.
You can't even see your faces.
But it said, "We can win this war, are winning this war we just need you to dig a little deeper."
They wanna give us that money.
No, they want to give it to you.
But you don't want to ask for it, give them hope.
You want to explain about this person and that flag.
Well, that's your choice.
Because if we admit we made a mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about and that will be that.
Gentlemen.
Mr. President, here they are.
- Well, hello.
Good to see you.
- Mr. President.
Darn good to see you, boys.
Heard you had a hell of a fight on your hands out there, hell of a fight.
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation in Arizona, am I right?
Yes, Mr. President.
Being an Indian, you are a truer American than any of us.
Bet your people are proud you're in that uniform.
Very proud, sir.
They should be.
Thank you for coming all this way to Washington to help us out.
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific now we need you to fight for a mountain of cash.
- I don't expect you'll let us down.
- No, sir.
- No, sir.
- Good.
Then go get it.
That's the end of this ceremony.
Let's take a look at this famous photo over here, see if I can pick you out.
My gosh.
There you are.
Boys.
Boys, this one's on me.
- To those who can't be with us.
- Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon.
May we have your autograph?
I suppose.
And your name is?
I get the impression I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.
You're such a hero.
I feel honored to be in your presence.
That's just not true.
That's professional work.
Here, to professionals.
Here they are.
You're the guys in the photograph, right?
I heard you were on the train.
Let me shake your hands.
John Tennack.
John Bradley.
These boys, Harvard and Yale types, didn't fight.
Pappies all rich sons of bitches.
Boys, shake hands with some real war heroes.
Excuse me for one moment.
Buy them a drink while you're at it.
Drinks for these men all the way around.
And you're the other one, John Tennack, Tennack Homes.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Pleased to meet you.
Have a drink.
And here's my card.
Listen to me, Rene.
When you get finished being famous, you come see me because if you can sell bonds, you can sell homes.
Now, they're not gonna build homes anymore, they're gonna deliver them.
- Heard of prefab homes?
- No, sir.
You will.
And you hang on to that card and you come see me, you hear?
- All right?
- Certainly will.
All right.
It's all right.
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?
If Mike and the guys could see us.
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it, would they?
Harlon!
Franklin!
Can you imagine Franklin on this train eating at the dining car with all the silver?
We shouldn't be here, Doc.
Ira!
Hey, Ira.
We heard the picture was posed.
- What?
- We heard you posed the picture!
Hey, Doc.
We're bigger than life, Doc.
- Hey, good job.
- Thank you.
Thank you, girls.
And now here are the men you've been waiting to meet the men in white.
Right behind me, here, the heroes of Iwo Jima:
Private First Class Rene Gagnon Private First Class Ira Hayes and Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley!
Thank you.
It's good of you to come out tonight in support of the war effort.
We really need you to buy bonds, that's for sure.
Because we can't win the war without your help.
As far as us being the heroes of Iwo Jima that's just not the case.
We really didn't do much at all.
Especially him.
Especially me.
I was just a runner.
That's it.
We put up a flag.
The pole we attached it to was heavy, so it took a number of us.
We had our picture taken doing it.
The real heroes are dead on that island.
We'd appreciate it if you bought bonds in honor of them.
Thank you.
Jump on any grenades, Ira?
Take out any machine gun nests I missed?
- At least I fired my weapon.
- All right, knock it off.
You hit anything or were you too drunk then too?
Hey, hey, hey.
Guys!
Come on.
Stop it.
Knock it off.
Sit between these two boys.
- For us and they need our help.
And if you think about it, I think you'll realize that buying more bonds is not just the right thing to do but the only thing to do.
Yes, this war has gone on too long.
We have given too many lives.
And its cost-
- Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
- Strawberry.
- Has been far too high.
But if we waver now if we don't dig deep and give more than we think we can then those sacrifices would be wasted...
- Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
...and those lives lost in vain.
Move!
Go, go!
Corpsman!
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over.
Where the hell are our tanks?
Stuck in the sand.
Captain says go without them.
Christ.
Real good work you're doing there, Rene.
Prepare to move out.
Pass the word.
- Prepare to move out!
- Second Platoon!
- Move!
Move!
- All right, Second Platoon, on your feet!
- Let's move out!
- Jackass.
- Let's move out!
- Go, go, go!
Move, go, go, move, move!
Corpsman!
Doc!
Doc, get out of there!
Corpsman!
Doc!
Doc, get the hell out of there!
May I have your attention, please?
Train number 48, with service from New York City Boston, Rochester, New York Toledo, Ohio, South Bend, Indiana is now arriving on Track 7.
Train number 48, now arriving on Track number 7.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.
- Come on, let's go.
- Boys.
- Watch your step, now.
- Thank you very much.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Watch your step.
- Let me help you, ma'am.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the heroes of Iwo Jima.
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.
- Private First Class Ira Hayes.
- Excuse me, let me through, please.
And Private First Class Rene Gagnon.
Rene!
That's my boyfriend!
- Who the hell is that?
- I don't know.
- Rene, is that your girl?
- Hey, what do they call you?
Hey, look at that!
What's your name, doll?
What's your name?
Hey, she's a beauty.
Let's go find a saloon.
Smile, boys.
Give them their money's worth.
Hey, Doc, how's the tour going for you?
Where exactly are you staying?
- Oh, I'm not sure yet.
- Just forget about that.
- Who's the dreamboat?
- Hey, Rene, a big smile.
Come on, one more shot.
Senator, I'd like you to meet Corpsman John Bradley.
- Doc, right?
- Yes, sir.
Good to meet you.
Now, we appreciate everything you've done and everything you're doing.
- Thank you, sir.
This is Captain White.
- Colonel Johns.
- We're proud of you, corpsman.
And then Colonel McCourtney.
- Major General Green.
- Nice to meet you.
Senator, this is Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Of course.
Now, I hear you used a tomahawk on those Japs, is that true, chief?
No, sir.
Well, tell them you did.
Makes a better story, huh?
- Attaboy.
- This is Captain Green.
John?
Madeline Evelley.
I recognize you from all the photographs.
I'm Hank's mom.
It's so nice to meet you, ma'am.
Hank was always talking about you.
- This is PFC Rene Gagnon.
- Pleasure to meet you, son.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thanks for everything.
- My pleasure.
- Not at all.
Ira, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Strank, Mike's mom.
It's all right.
When I got the telegram, I...
I don't know what I'm trying to say here.
Knowing he was with you that day and seeing him in that photograph I don't know why it makes me feel better, but it does.
- It's so silly, isn't it?
- No, it's not.
How are you, son?
Thank you very much.
We're the largest furniture wholesaler in Illinois.
- Thank you.
Excuse me.
- I'll make sure he calls.
- Well, thank you.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
Are you Rene?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Franklin's mother.
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.
I'm Pauline, Rene's girlfriend.
Would you mind?
Paper said that's Hank and I honestly can't tell.
It's horrible of a mother not to know her own son, isn't it?
But that's him, isn't it?
Well, to be honest, ma'am, it happened so quick and with everything that was going on it's hard to remember who was where.
But yeah, I think that's where he was.
That's Hank.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Excuse us.
Take him outside.
I'm Pauline.
Nice to meet you.
He was the best Marine I ever knew.
Thank you.
- You okay, chief?
- Christ.
- I'm okay.
- Yeah, you look it.
You're gonna screw this up, aren't you?
You're gonna screw it up for all of us.
I've got him.
Get some sleep, Ira.
- Mike?
- Yeah?
- Do you see this?
- What?
- Mike?
- Oh, shit, go!
He's killing me!
Hey, Doc, you think they got them all?
- What?
- Well, they're not shooting at us.
Maybe we killed them all or they ran off in the night.
Or they're waiting for us to start climbing.
Third Platoon!
Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.
- Just us?
- Yeah, just us, Igg.
All right, Third Platoon, move!
I tag along?
You can lead the way, if you want.
Get a good shot of my face.
It's your ass I'm gonna make famous, Hank.
Hey, that'll work for me too.
Lieutenant, if you make it to the top, put this up.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, Iggy.
They never shoot at the first patrol.
- They don't?
- No.
They want us to go up, signal that it's okay then shoot everybody else as they come up the mountain.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Unless, of course, they want to make an example of us and discourage the others.
I think you're full of crap, you know that, Hank?
Really?
Jesus.
Thank God that ain't us.
Told you.
Boots, spread them out and put them on a line.
Set up a perimeter!
First Squad!
- Hank?
Find me a pole.
- Yeah.
Right here.
Let's put this flag up.
Watch it.
Right over here.
Here, here.
That's good.
Right here, right here.
Got that end?
Hold that steady.
Lindberg.
- Hey, who's got rope?
- Right here.
- Give me something
- Yeah, good.
- That work?
Do it, fellas.
Keep it coming.
USMC!
USMC!
- Shit, look!
- Look at that!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Jeez, look at that.
Get down!
Take cover!
Cover with that. 30!
- Watch it!
Twenty yards down, Hank!
- You see them?
- I got about 20 yards, left side.
- Lindberg, get the flamethrower!
Boots, you see them?
Cover right!
- About 20 yards down!
Duck one!
- You see them?
Keep the cover on!
Second Squad, you see them?
Get me some grenades!
I see them!
- You see them?
- Right flank, over to the right!
Cover me, I'm going down!
Careful, Iggy.
Easy.
All clear!
Okay, guys, who wants to be famous?
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
- Goddamn it.
Strank!
- Sir?
They want a phone line run up to the top of the mountain.
Let me guess, they picked us.
Second Platoon, let's go.
Get some exercise.
Let's go.
Get off your ass.
Oh, shit!
Hope it still works, because you're not getting mine.
- Get Forrestal!
- All right.
I don't know whose idea it was, Mr. Secretary.
Well, it was goddamned brilliant.
I want that flag, Holland.
Mark my words raising that son of a bitch means a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.
I want that flag.
Yes, sir.
I'll make sure no one touches it.
You can count on me.
Fuck that.
That flag belongs to the men in this battalion.
That son of a bitch thinks our men died taking this ground so we could hand our flag to some politician to pin to his wall?
He's out of his goddamn mind!
Get me that flag and find another one to replace it.
You've gotta be shitting me.
Gagnon!
Get your ass over here.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey, fellas.
- How you doing?
Missed a beautiful shot, Joe.
It's that kind of day.
- Hey, Mike.
- Hell of a view, lieutenant.
Lieutenant!
Captain says he wants that flag.
- He wants this flag?
- Yes, sir.
- We just put the damn thing up.
- Yes, sir.
Some kind of flag shortage?
He wants you to put this one up instead.
Hey, Mike.
- Do me a favor.
Put this up, will you?
- Yes, sir.
All right, let's find a pole.
Take the flag down, boys.
Captain's orders.
You heard him, let's do it.
- There you go.
- Lordy, she's a heavy one.
All right, hang on.
Put this on.
One hell of a view.
Good view from up here.
Yes, I'd say so myself.
All right.
- Not in your way here, am I, Joe?
- No, I'm fine, thanks.
Hey, Doc, you wanna give us a hand here?
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.
Ready?
Ready?
Let's go.
Did you get it?
I don't know.
I wish I could've seen their faces.
Nobody even noticed that second flag going up.
Everybody saw that damn picture and made up their own story about it.
But your dad and the others knew what they had done and what they had not.
All your friends dying it's hard enough to be called a hero for saving somebody's life.
But for putting up a pole?
You gotta be kidding.
Hey!
It took a lot of talented folks a long time to make that thing.
Wait till tonight, when it's lit properly, there's thousands of cheering people.
It's gonna look a lot better.
So stadium lights come down, spotlight comes up, you get your cue.
Charge up this thing with the flag, plant it at the top.
You smile, you wave.
You know the drill.
You want us to plant the flag on a pile of papier-maché.
Hey, that's show biz.
And try and stand how you stood the first time you planted it.
You know, pretend the other three guys are with you.
The dead guys.
Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, not a problem.
- Good.
But where do we imagine Hank is standing?
Sorry?
Seeing that he wasn't there, it'll be kind of hard for us to leave a space for him.
I think you know exactly where he was.
You pointed him out to his mother.
This is bullshit.
I planted that damn thing once and I'm not doing it again.
- Hayes.
- For chrissake.
Hayes.
Hayes, get your ass back here or you're going on report.
Hayes!
You wanna do your damn job?
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Come on!
Come on!
He's with me!
Hey, he's with me!
- Back off!
- Sir, he's with me, okay?
He's with me.
Ira, put the goddamn chair down!
- Put the chair down, son!
- Put the chair down, Ira!
Tell them drop their sticks!
They're cops.
They're supposed to have nightsticks.
You're not supposed to be swinging a chair.
- Calm down, son.
- Sir, turn around, please.
That poster right there?
The one on the end, that's him.
- That's him?
- Yes, sir.
Do you read the papers?
Oh, Christ.
We got another fucking hero.
Get him out of here.
- Can you do that?
- Yes, sir.
Put the goddamn chair down.
And let's go.
Did you start this?
He didn't serve me!
I don't make the rules.
We don't serve Indians.
He needs to go sleep it off.
Soldier Field.
You hear that?
What the hell is that?
I can't figure it out.
Keep an eye out.
Hey, it sounds like it's coming from up there.
They're using grenades.
They're killing themselves.
Ira, let's go.
Come on.
Let's go, Ira.
Come on.
Thank God.
Jesus.
Look at you, chief.
You found him.
Holy shit.
You would have to pick today.
Vandegrift is here with enough brass to start a fucking band.
- Come on, let's go.
Can you walk?
- Yes, sir.
By yourself?
All right, look.
I don't care if you have to carry him.
Get him to the top, plant that flag, and don't fucking fall off.
Get him in his stuff.
I'll stall these guys for as long as I can.
Hurry up.
Jesus Christ.
And now the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Cover!
Harlon!
Harlon!
Get your fire team up in that position!
O'Hare!
First Fire Team!
Work around!
B.A.R., you, other side of the ridge!
Covering fire, boys.
Go, go, go!
Jackson, work your team around to the left!
Cover!
Left flank!
Left flank!
Franklin, Gus, go check it out!
Hustle up, boys!
- We got them!
- Clear!
One hell of an experience.
Move out!
Cease fire!
They're my men!
You're targeting our men!
You're targeting our-
Get me another radio!
Sergeant?
Sergeant!
Mike!
Mike, Mike, Mike!
Mike?
Mike!
Here.
Hey, where's Doc?
Corpsman!
Oh, shit.
How's his breathing?
Harlon, move, buddy.
Hey, Mike.
Mike, Mike, can you hear us?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on, Mike.
Mike?
Mike, can you hear us?
Oh, Jesus.
All right, let's go!
Move out!
We need a hand over here.
I'm gonna get a stretcher.
Let's take him down, move him off the beach.
Ladies and gentlemen, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Corpsman!
Hank!
Hank!
Doc, they killed me.
Harlon!
Doc they killed me.
Come on, Harlon.
Harlon, stay with me.
Franklin!
- Franklin.
- I'm fine, Ira.
Corpsman!
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't.
He was right here.
Now, where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
Shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Does it open?
Iggy!
Iggy!
Iggy, are you down there?
Iggy!
Can't tell who it is, but he's one of ours.
I had to go outside to throw up.
Look what they did to the poor son of a bitch.
You okay, chief?
Just let it go.
If that doesn't pry open their wallets, nothing will.
Jesus Christ, he's drunk.
Goddamn Indians.
Come on, chief.
Let's get you home.
That's not what I hear.
I called around, I'm not stupid.
He's been drunk since he started this damn tour, making a spectacle of himself.
Just about choked that poor woman at the reception, blubbering.
Jesus Christ, you're supposed to be watching these men.
- Yes, sir.
- He's making us look like regular asses.
With all due respect, he never wanted to come on this trip.
Had to pull him, kicking, screaming, off that boat.
He wants to be with his unit.
What unit?
They're all fucking dead.
This is how he honors those men, by drinking and throwing up and...?
You know what?
He wants it?
Great, we'll send him back.
Get him packed and on a train today.
He's an embarrassment to the uniform.
Yes, sir.
I'll do it.
Yeah, no, that's, that's good.
That's what I want.
I know it's a good thing raising the money and that, because we need it.
But I can't take them calling me a hero.
All I did was try not to get shot.
Some of the things I saw done, things I did they weren't things to be proud of, you know?
Mike.
Mike was a hero.
You ever meet him?
No.
Best Marine I ever met.
You know, chief, I think if Mike was sitting here instead of you he'd be saying the same thing about himself not being a hero.
Maybe.
He was a good guy.
But I think that he would be ashamed of me seeing me the way I am.
Think I could see my ma before they ship me off?
Think they'd do that?
See my ma?
I'm sorry, Ira.
We got stories now to tell our kids, I guess.
Keep your head down.
All aboard.
Good luck, chief.
Think I saw him once after that.
It was maybe six or seven years after the war.
I was working as a salesman, doing a lot of driving.
I was driving west across Texas.
I was trying to get where I was going so I could get home.
And I saw this guy hitchhiking on the side of the road.
And for a second, I thought it might've been him.
I'll always regret that I didn't stop, but I was in a hurry.
And he was an Indian.
We always told the press Ira insisted that he was going back to fight with his unit which was at least partially true but that isn't what got the headlines.
We're engaged.
Excuse me a minute, darling.
- Hey, Doc?
- Yeah?
Got a minute?
- Yeah.
- I'll see you at the car.
- You hear I'm getting married?
- I did, Rene.
That's great.
Yeah, it's something she wants.
She waited for me all this time.
She's not used to all this, but she's a good girl.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
So I was wondering if you'd be my best man.
Me?
Don't you have somebody at home, a buddy you'd rather ask?
Well, I didn't really make many.
The ones who didn't go, it's, well, it's hard to even talk to them.
- You know.
- Yeah, I know.
I'd be proud to.
Thank you.
I better go drag her away from them before she announces I'm gonna be president of General Motors or something.
All right.
- Congratulations, honey.
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Rene, you're a lucky man.
- Here they are now.
- Here they come.
Grab a shot of them on the steps.
- Big smile, Mrs. Gagnon!
- Say cheese.
I couldn't complain, because the press loved them so they wrote more articles and people bought more bonds.
The tour went on with just Rene and your dad.
And the true heroes are the men who didn't make it home from Iwo Jima the men who died at Iwo Jima and in other campaigns.
We ask that you honor the memory of those men by buying the war bonds and helping us to win this war.
Thank you.
City after city, I thought the damn thing would never end.
And this rumor kept going around that the photograph had been staged.
Your dad said he wished he'd known he was having his picture taken because he would've ducked the hell out of it.
Was this your idea?
Whose idea was it?
Who wanted to stage the thing?
Was there truth to the rumor that that picture was staged, Doc?
- Come on!
Doc?
- Can you answer that?
I remember when your dad got shot.
All hell was busting loose.
People back home saw that picture and thought it was over when we took Suribachi.
We wished.
Anyways, we're pinned down.
Mortars, shells, machine guns.
Fire coming from every which direction, right?
And we hear somebody call, "Corpsman down."
Corpsman down!
Blood was spurting out of his throat and Doc was doing everything he could.
And the corpsman looks up at him and he knows what this means, shot in the neck.
He knows he's dying, you can see that.
But still, in his eyes he's pleading with Doc to save his life.
And Doc can't.
- You okay, Doc?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah, you look fine.
- I'm okay.
Keep down, all right?
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.
Okay.
Corpsman.
Corpsman!
For God's sake, corpsman.
Corpsman?
Corpsman.
Incoming!
Let me see.
It's not that bad, you're gonna be okay.
All right?
Just stay with me.
Look at me.
Took us a half-hour to find your dad.
He could've bled to death.
Coming down.
We got a chest wound.
Put pressure on it.
Thanks.
Vets will tell you about being hit but not wanting to leave their buddies.
Usually, they're lying.
You'll take any excuse to get out of there.
But it happens.
You get the feeling you're letting them down.
I could see that in your dad's face.
Oh, he wanted to go.
He'd seen enough.
But he didn't want to leave us.
Now, he was a hell of a good man, your dad.
Yeah.
While we were sitting there on the beach we heard this great roar.
And we looked up...
That was the first of thousands of landings on Iwo.
- Look at that.
- Yeah.
How about that.
I'm gonna head back, all right?
Good luck.
That island saved a lot of lives.
A lot of lives.
I don't know what else to tell you.
After the bond tour, my dad finally got his operation.
By the time he got home, the war was over.
First thing he did was ask my mom to marry him.
Ira tried to get on with his life and put it all behind him.
Like to thank you for having me here today.
It's an honor to be in front of such a strong people.
Because of the war white men will understand Indians a lot better.
And it's going to be a better world.
But life had other plans for him.
You're
- You're him, aren't you?
You're the hero, right?
Great.
All right, kids, go get your picture taken.
Oh, that's great.
That's great.
All right, now say cheese.
- Cheese.
- Cheese.
That's great.
Okay.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Thanks.
- Come on.
- That's a hero, kids.
Hey, hero, lift this basket, will you?
It's too heavy for me.
Rene tried to take advantage of those offers he'd received on the bond tour.
Yes, G-A-G-N-O-N.
Right.
Pronounced "Rene."
Rene, yes.
I actually called last week.
Yes.
Okay, yes.
Mr. Gagnon.
I gave Mr. Tennack your message.
I'm sure he'll call you.
Okay.
All right thank you.
But he was yesterday's hero.
He even applied for a job at the local police station.
They said he wasn't qualified.
After working the factory with Pauline he tried a few things but spent the rest of his life as a janitor.
But Ira...
Ira.
You got a visitor.
Ira always made the news.
I could never find out why he did it, but one day Ira just took off.
He walked and hitched over 1300 miles from Arizona to Texas.
He found Harlon Block's father working his field.
His wife, Belle, had left him soon after they discovered Harlon died.
She never forgave him for letting her son go off to war.
And Ira told him the truth.
That it had been his son who raised the flag with them his son in the photograph.
And then he just turned and walked away.
Though the flag-raising meant nothing to him he somehow knew it would mean everything to them.
Thanks for calling.
Just as Belle knew all along.
The press soon found out and called Hank's mom with the news that it wasn't her son after all.
The last time they all saw each other was at the unveiling of the Marine Corps War Memorial.
And even though he'd planted the first flag above Iwo Jima Hank's mother and father weren't invited.
Ira.
It's good to see you, Ira.
Hell of a statue.
It wasn't long after that that they found Ira.
The papers said he died of exposure.
There was no autopsy.
It was about that same time my father got in his car early one morning telling my mom he had something to do.
He drove to a town on the other side of Wisconsin, where Iggy's mom lived.
Ever since she heard the news about her son she'd been trying to find out how he died, and no one would tell her.
I never found out what he told her but I can pretty much guarantee it wasn't the truth.
My mother would ask him what was troubling him.
He would never say.
And every year, as it got close to Memorial Day the reporters would start calling, asking to interview my father.
No, I'm sorry, he's fishing in Canada.
We were always instructed to say the same thing.
Okay.
Thanks.
When Mr. McCandless retired my father bought the funeral home where he'd worked since coming home.
He spent the rest of his life running the business and raising his family.
He never spoke about the war or about the flag-raising.
Never told us anything.
The first time I heard any of these stories was after he died.
Where is he?
Oh, God.
He's not here, Dad.
He died.
Who?
Who died?
Iggy.
Iggy.
Christ, poor Iggy.
I hadn't thought of him for years.
How do you know about Iggy?
You were calling for him.
When you collapsed.
I wasn't looking for Iggy.
I was looking for you.
I wanted to...
I wanted to tell you, I'm- I'm sorry I wasn't a better father.
Talked to you more.
I just...
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
You were the best father a man could have.
Did I ever tell you they took us swimming?
No, Dad.
After we planted the flag, we came down off the mountain and they let us swim.
It was the funniest thing.
All this fighting and-
And we were jumping around in the water like kids.
That's the way I remember Iggy now.
I finally came to the conclusion that maybe he was right.
Maybe there's no such thing as heroes.
Maybe there are just people like my dad.
I finally came to understand why they were so uncomfortable being called heroes.
Heroes are something we create, something we need.
It's a way for us to understand what is almost incomprehensible how people could sacrifice so much for us.
But for my dad and these men the risks they took, the wounds they suffered they did that for their buddies.
They may have fought for their country, but they died for their friends.
For the man in front, for the man beside them.
And if we wish to truly honor these men we should remember them the way they really were the way my dad remembered them.
Come on, Doc!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
For God sakes!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Honey, what's wrong?
Every jackass thinks he knows what war is.
Especially those who've never been in one.
We like things nice and simple, good and evil, heroes and villains.
There's always plenty of both.
Most of the time, they are not who we think they are.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where...
Where is he?
Where is he?
Mr. Bradley?
Mr. B?
You okay?
- Where is he?
- Where is who?
Where is he?
Where did he go?
Where...
Where is he?
All right.
Just stay right here, okay?
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
It'll be okay.
Where is he?
Most guys I knew would never talk about what happened over there.
Probably 'cause they're still trying to forget about it.
They certainly didn't think of themselves as heroes.
They died without glory.
Nobody has taken their pictures.
Only their buddies knew what they did.
I'd tell their folks they died for their country.
I'm not sure that was it.
Now, there were plenty other photos taken that day, but none anybody wanted to see.
What we see and do in war, the cruelty, is unbelievable.
But somehow we gotta make some sense of it.
To do that, we need a easy to understand truth and damn few words.
Film's ruined.
I don't know.
This one looks all right.
And if you can get a picture...
Now, the right picture can win or lose a war.
You're gonna want to see this.
Look at Vietnam.
The picture of that South Vietnamese officer blowing that fella's brains out of the side of his head, whammo!
That was it.
The war was lost.
We just hung around trying to pretend it wasn't.
Took a lot of other pictures that day.
None of them made a difference.
Thanks.
Appreciate it.
Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.
Country was bankrupt.
People were becoming cynical and tired of war.
Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon!
Where?
Right there.
Planting that flag, that's your brother.
Ma, all you can see is his behind.
And that's his.
I powdered and diapered it, I know my son.
That's him.
Go get your father.
Daddy, Ma's got a picture of Harlon's keister in the paper.
You watch your mouth, young man.
Thank you.
One photo, almost all on its own, turned that around.
It's on the front page of every major paper.
Over 200 dailies and they're all flooded with requests for prints.
I think we might have found it.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- I gotta go get him.
- Oh, no, you don't.
Iggy, I gotta go.
I have a whole different theory.
He wants medical attention bad enough, he'll come to us.
Shut up and crawl over here, you lazy son-of-a-bitch!
As soon as that flare goes out.
- Crap.
Okay, well, I'll go with you.
- No.
You're actually gonna leave me here?
I'll be right back, just shoot some people.
I gotta go.
Oh, God.
Okay, it's okay.
Don't touch them.
Don't touch them.
Get your hands out of there.
Let me do that.
I'll do it, okay?
Don't look.
Keep your head back.
Keep your eyes on me.
All right, look at me.
I'll get it.
I'll take care of it.
We'll get this bandage on you.
We'll get you taken care of.
And we'll get you down to the bottom, all right?
Look, you're gonna be fine.
It's okay.
I'll do that.
I'll do that.
Here, put some pressure on that.
Put your hands on top and put some pressure on it.
Keep your head back.
Keep breathing.
Keep looking at me, all right?
Just keep looking at...
Doc.
Help me.
Help me.
All right.
Okay.
How's that feel?
- It feels good.
- It does?
All right.
- Good.
- All right.
I'm gonna go get a stretcher and get you down to the beach.
I'll be right back.
I'm all right.
Go and help someone who's hurt.
All right.
Hold on there.
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Lggy!
Lggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Lggy!
Holy shit.
They expect us to climb this?
Or something just like it.
So, where you think they're sending us?
I think it's the desert, Franklin.
Well, that makes no sense at all.
Well, it's just military psychology.
They always train you for the desert on a volcano.
Now you're just having fun with me.
Harlon, take your men right.
- Watch for Bedouins.
- Yes, sir.
- What's a Bedouin?
- It's a guy with a camel.
Well, Jeez Louise, maybe we are going to the desert.
Now, you tilt that to the right, but what if the bullet comes from the left?
Bullets don't come from the left.
You know any left-handed Japs?
That makes about as much sense as you showering with your shoes on.
You don't even know why you do it, do you?
'Cause I don't tell you mean I don't know?
You do it 'cause Mike does it.
I'll ask him.
So you cut hair back home?
Some.
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?
No, I just studied it a little.
But not in barber school?
Nope.
- Gosh.
- Let me guess, Hayes is winning.
Chief, I had very little to do with Sitting Bull's death, so maybe you could stop taking it out on me.
Different tribe.
The Pimas fought on the side of the white man.
- See, now that's smart.
- That is smart.
Yeah.
Worked real good for us.
Good luck, fellas.
Hey, good night, Lindberg.
Dead bodies.
He cuts hair on dead bodies.
What?
Even I knew that.
- Who's in?
- Oh, I'm in.
I'm in.
It must be a lot easier with them not moving around and all.
- There's that.
- Yeah.
You know what I been thinking?
Well, they been telling us we need to buddy up and I think we'd make pretty good buddies.
And how do you figure that?
Well, you know, in that we have a lot in common.
So, why do you cut dead people's hair, anyway?
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.
You tell a lot of people that?
You actually chose the Marines because they got the best uniform?
No sense being a hero if you don't look like one.
Jacks.
Queens.
Shit.
Do anything on that reservation but play cards, Chief?
All right, listen up, you sorry bunch of leathernecks!
We practice going over the side tomorrow which means we ain't long for this piece of rock.
All right!
One more thing, any man who doesn't have his masturbation papers in order better get them signed by tomorrow night or he ain't going overseas.
- I got mine already.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm square.
Wait.
Why am I just hearing about this?
That's horseshit, Franklin.
I don't have to repeat everything twice for you.
No, I didn't hear nothing about no masturbating papers.
Heard they were running short.
You know, nobody tells me nothing.
That's real nice, guys.
All right, get your ass over to the officer in charge of records.
Maybe he got some more left.
- Leave your smokes.
I'll play for you.
- Thanks, Mike.
Listen, he calls you an idiot, you take it like a man, okay?
Just do not leave without signing them.
- I appreciate it, Sergeant.
- You got it.
What the hell happened to your hair, Rene?
Look like a goddamn corpse.
Three points of contact on that rope at all times.
Next four.
Over the side.
Let's go.
Keep moving.
Next four, over the side.
Just keep your eye on the guy below you.
That's all you gotta look at.
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.
Keep three points of contact on the rope at all times.
You see?
No big thing.
Just one step at a time and keep your hands on the vertical rope.
Remember, once you're in the boat move away from the rope.
Just make sure you keep three points of contact on the rope.
I got him!
All right, get that man out of the water.
Give me a hand.
Grab his pack.
Don't worry about him, Doc.
All right, quit skylarking!
Keep it moving!
He'll be fine.
Our target, Island X, is an ugly, smelly, dirty little scab of rock called Iwo Jima.
It means "Sulfur Island," which accounts for the smell.
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop, you ask me.
After 20 straight days of bombing you won't find a blade of grass or a twig on it.
It wasn't that pretty to start with.
Captain?
Lwo's just five-and-a-half miles long, two-and-a-half wide.
There's a lump down at the bottom.
That's Mount Suribachi.
On the maps in front of you the island is white.
Not much of it.
The black dots represent known enemy emplacements.
Coastal defense guns, dual-mount dual-purpose guns, covered artillery emplacements.
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes, and earth-covered structures.
I don't see any barracks or any other structures.
That's right.
And we still don't know why.
Now, this isn't just any island to them.
This isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, or Saipan.
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders in eight square miles.
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.
It's up to us to convince them.
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.
The 8th Ammo Company will land here to re-supply.
The Suribachi's guns are the biggest problem.
They can hit any point on the island.
We're sitting ducks until we take them out.
That's our job.
We cut across the island, right at the base, slit its throat, lop off its head.
And we take that mountain.
We take that mountain, we take their big guns.
We take their eyes.
Okay, I'm heading in.
Follow me.
Let's put a good show on for the Marines.
Close it up.
Take it right down to the deck.
Yeah, boys!
Man overboard portside!
See him?
Throw me a line!
He's right there.
- Where is he?
- Watch out, watch out, watch out.
Hawaii's that way!
Just keep paddling, Mac, we'll catch you on the way back!
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!
They're not gonna stop.
What?
None of them are.
They can't.
So much for "No man left behind."
- Sir.
- Come on in.
Look, I've had to make a few other changes.
I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
- You bet.
Trouble is, I already told my men I'd see them through this.
That your James Cagney impersonation?
'Cause I've heard better.
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.
Look, this isn't your first time through this.
- You don't need to prove anything.
- No, sir.
You're not the best sergeant I've ever had, you're just the best one that's still walking.
- Block's a good man.
- Yes, sir, he is.
The men know him, he can step right in.
You know, I have actually thought this through.
Platoon sergeant puts you further away from the bullets.
I already gave them my word, sir.
I told them I'd bring them all home to their mothers which means I already lied to half of them.
Can't lie to the rest.
- How are your men?
- They'll do fine.
Except maybe Gagnon.
Our own Tyrone Power?
Yes, sir.
He's a good man, just might be better use further back from the lines.
I'll use him as a runner.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
Now get out of here.
Hear the good news, Doc?
We're going in with the first waves.
Hey, you do that again I'll take your head off!
Fucking dominoes.
Iggy, have you ever heard news you considered to be bad?
The first ones off the ship, Doc.
Means we don't go over the side of the ship.
We hop on a tractor, they drive us right there.
Oh, shit, that is good news.
You see?
What'd I tell you?
What's going on?
Look at that.
We're killing them!
We're killing them, Doc.
I was promised 10 days of shelling.
You're giving me three and saying that's the best you can do?
I don't give a shit!
My men hit that beach with less than 10 and I'll be taking them home to their mamas in buckets!
Yeah, I know exactly why.
Because every Navy man with a scrambled egg on his chest wants to offload us here and sail to Japan so they can be there for the big finish, tell their kids they captured the Emperor all by themselves.
Well, you aren't going to Japan unless we take this piece of shit island!
These little pricks are dug in!
Okay, appreciate that, Jim.
Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
I'm okay.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
Jesus, Iggy, just leave me alone, all right?
How about you guys?
Knife?
Bayonet?
Kick in the ass?
How about you, Doc?
Sharpen your knife?
You sharpened it three times already.
Well, then I better make sure I didn't nick it.
Good man, Doc.
- Hey, Doc.
- Yeah.
When we land, try not to wave this kit around too much.
They got sharpshooters that are trained to look for them.
And they know that if they take out a corpsman another dozen Marines will die unattended.
All right?
Okay, Mike.
Yeah, right there.
Close the damn door.
For God's sake.
Yeah, like that's gonna help.
That your girlfriend, Chief?
Bet she's a pretty damn good-looking squaw.
Bet you're missing her, and that little wigwam of yours.
Welcome, all Marines off Iwo Jima.
We have a long-time wait...
It's what they do to prisoners,
- at least the lucky ones.
- Jesus.
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think about waving a white bandanna.
Poor Marines, so far from home for no good reason.
Think of your girls back home, waiting for you.
But a girl cannot stay home every night.
So who do you think they're with tonight?
And will she let him kiss her?
And will he comfort her at your funeral?
This sweet music is to make you think of your girls back home who are missing you.
This is all for now.
I'll see you tomorrow night.
Gunners!
Move, let's go!
Let's go, get up on the berm!
Gunners!
We're clear!
Get up the berm!
Baker Company, move out!
- Seen Second Platoon?
- I don't see them.
First Squad, move it out!
God, this place reeks.
- Go, go, go!
- Move out!
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go!
Go!
Go, go!
Drop your packs!
Go!
All clear!
- Jesus, you needed some exercise?
- He got lost.
A hundred landing craft heading for one beach and this guy gets lost.
Now I'm glad we did.
Jesus, what a mess.
Any theories why they ain't shooting?
It's getting on my nerves.
Maybe they're all dead.
What do you think, Doc?
You think they're all dead?
Mike, take six men and bring that gun onto the beach.
Second Platoon, let's move out!
Stay down.
Come on.
Move!
Move!
- Get down!
- Take cover!
Move out!
Cover fire!
Pour it on!
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!
Corpsman!
I'm gonna sling your arm and then I'll give you a shot for the pain!
Move, move!
Off the beach!
Take cover!
You got a girl back home, Marine?
We're gonna make sure she sees you, all right?
I need pressure on this wound!
Where's the fire coming from?
Where are they?
Look for a flash, shoot at it!
Let's go, let...
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!
You're over!
Third Squad, forward!
Move!
Where are they, sir?
We got ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock, pillbox!
Sergeant!
- Sergeant!
I think I can clear that out.
- What?
All right, you go.
Here.
Take these.
Check your weapon.
Yeah?
Go!
Cover!
Cover him!
Cover, cover!
Son-of-a-bitch.
Let's go!
Go!
Move it out!
Go, go, go!
Down, down, down!
It's clear.
Good work.
I thought you said it was clear!
It was!
Shit, I guess they're not in there firing at us then.
Lindberg!
Yeah!
Light it up!
I'll cover you, Ice!
Don't cover shit!
There's already enough people shooting!
One bullet and this thing goes up like a Roman candle!
Go!
Shift fire!
Shift your fire!
Go, go!
Shift your fire!
Shift your fire!
Go!
Move it out!
Hit the deck!
Stay down!
Wait for support!
Is this a bad battle or what?
It's a fucking slaughter.
Christ Jesus!
Get a machine gun team set up over here, now!
Thank God!
Tanks!
Runner!
Get those tanks up here!
Oh, shit.
Get down!
Corporal, watch your left flank!
Let's go without them!
Move out!
Move out!
Lggy, you gotta lift your side, he's gonna roll off.
Got it, Doc!
Incoming!
Move, move, move, move!
Keep moving!
Get that LVT up on the beach!
Keep moving!
You're next, pal, we're getting you out of here.
Move it!
Great news.
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa, 'cause that's where we're headed.
Not you and me.
Captain Severance asked me who else was in that picture, and Christ if I could remember, but it was Mike and Doc and Franklin and me and Hank Hansen but I just remembered, you were there, too.
I wasn't there.
'Course you were.
Neither was Hank.
He raised the first flag.
It was Harlon Block that raised that one.
Shit.
I told them it was Hank.
You weren't there, Mr. Smart Ass, how'd you know it was Harlon?
- You tell them it was me?
- No.
Like I said, I just remembered.
Good, keep your mouth shut.
They know there was somebody else, you can see it in the picture.
Then pick someone dead.
They don't want somebody dead, you dumb redskin, they want to ship us back to the States.
What did I tell you?
I wasn't there.
- You hear?
- All right.
Just settle down.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're not going anywhere.
Who the hell says?
This is horseshit.
You wounded, son?
No, sir.
Well, did you take out a nest of Japs butt-naked with your bare hands?
'Cause if I'm gonna give up my seat to a hero he better have a good goddamn story to tell.
No, sir.
Then enjoy it, 'cause they'll forget you before Christmas.
The sixth man, you got a name?
Sorry, still don't remember.
It's a damn shame, 'cause I promised the Major you'd know who it was.
Fact, you not knowing throws a doubt on you being one of the flag-raisers yourself.
Since no one wants to be embarrassed, the moment you land they'll turn you around, ship you off to Okinawa in time to meet your buddies on the beach.
So, why don't you stop screwing with me?
Give me a damn name.
Gangway!
Gangway!
Let's go, let's go!
Gangway!
Where the hell is that son-of-a-bitch?
Hayes!
Hayes?
Hayes, get your red ass over here!
Make me look like I don't know what my own men are doing with a flag the size of my mother's house?
God damn it, Ira, you shouldn't have lied to me.
You made me look like a complete asshole.
We're gonna miss you around here.
Good luck.
Now your name's in the paper, too.
Just heard your doctor say we're postponing your operation.
You're being shipped back to the mainland.
Everybody who saw that picture thought planting the flag meant victory.
That's all they wanted to know.
Victory.
Within a few weeks of that picture being taken, half the men in it were dead.
Mrs. Hansen!
Mrs. Hansen!
Did you know Hank was a hero?
- Are you proud of him, Mrs. Hansen?
- What was he like as a boy?
Look this way, please, ma'am.
What do you have to say about your son?
But somehow being a part of it meant something.
Looking at it, you could believe their sacrifice was not a waste.
Yeah, I might have thought that was Harlon, too.
It is.
Belle, their names are right here.
It's not him.
And he would be alive and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.
You think about that when you look at his picture, Ed.
And I need to rush home and change because there's the Governor's banquet and then there's the parade.
Imagine, the Governor is coming here to meet us.
Now, I'm wearing blue so, if...
- Are you going to change?
- We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin from CBS World News.
A press association has just announced that President Roosevelt is dead.
The President died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
All we know so far is that the President died at Warm Springs in Georgia.
Further updates every hour.
Temperatures will remain the same today, in the mid-30s to low 40s with clear skies.
Hello?
Yes.
Of course.
No, we understand.
It wouldn't be right.
Thank you.
Here he is, gentlemen.
Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.
Senator Haddigan.
I'd like you to meet Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Damn good to meet you.
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.
Sorry?
That's Pima Indian talk, boy, don't you know your own language?
Took forever to memorize the damn gibberish.
Sorry, I've been away from the reservation too long, Senator.
- Doc.
- Ira.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
- That's you.
- Go, go, go, go.
Go.
Please welcome
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley,
Private First Class Ira Hayes,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon!
Holy shit.
Come in, come in, come in.
Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Bud Gurber.
- You showing the boys the sights?
- We saw a hell of a ball game.
That's great.
The bar's there, help yourself.
I got some briefing sheets for you here, just some simple things we want you to say.
Mostly, "Buy bonds," can't say that too often.
Itineraries, those are changing every couple minutes.
Everybody wants to meet you guys.
I got women sending up envelopes with stockings in them, notes written in lipstick.
We won't mention that to the press, am I right?
Have a drink, for Christ's sake.
My God, what you boys must have seen over there.
I've been watching the newsreels.
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.
So, we got a hell of a lot of money to raise, not a lot of time.
White House tomorrow, then we trot you over to shake hands with a couple of hundred Congressmen who won't pull a penny out of their pockets.
Politicians and actors.
You put them in a restaurant together, they'd die of old age before picking up the check.
Then New York City, Times Square, dinners with various hoi polloi, then Chicago...
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?
That's what we're calling the mothers of the dead flag-raisers.
You present each mother with a flag, they say a few words, people will shit money.
It'll be so moving.
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.
Lovely woman.
She knows how close you and her son were.
He wrote home about you.
She is very, very much looking forward to meeting you.
Hank wasn't in the picture.
Sorry?
Hank didn't raise that flag.
He raised the other one, the real flag.
The what?
The real...
The real flag?
There's a real flag?
Yeah, ours was the replacement flag.
We put it up when they took the other one down.
Am I the only one getting a headache here?
You know about this?
It was after it was already in the papers.
The mothers had already been told, but...
That's it, that's beautiful.
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Yeah, why tell me?
I'm only the guy that has to explain it to 150 million Americans.
Who is in the goddamn picture?
Are any of you guys in the goddamn picture?
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.
Six guys raising a flag over Iwo Jima.
Victory is ours.
You're three of them, right?
This was the fifth day, sir.
The battle went on for 35 more.
Well, what'd you do, raise a goddamn flag every time you stopped for lunch?
Can I hit this guy?
You know what, I don't give a shit, you're in the picture, you raised the flag, that's the story we're selling, boys.
Are you deaf?
Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?
Harlon Block.
That's whose mother should be here if anyone's should be.
You know, I think this whole damn thing is a farce, you ask me.
You know what they're calling this bond drive?
The Mighty Seventh.
They might've called it the
"We're Flat Fucking Broke And Can't Even Afford Bullets
"So We're Begging For Your Pennies" bond drive, but it didn't have quite the ring.
They could've called it that, though, because the last four bond drives came up so short we just printed money instead.
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street, he'll tell you our dollar is next to worthless, we borrowed so much.
And nobody is lending any more.
Ships aren't being built.
Tanks aren't being built.
Machine guns, bazookas, hand grenades, zip.
You think this is a farce?
You want to go back to your buddies?
Well, stuff some rocks in your pockets before you get on the plane because that's all we got left to throw at the Japanese.
And don't be surprised if your plane doesn't make it off the runway because the fuel dumps are empty.
And our good friends, the Arabs, are only taking bullion.
If we don't raise $14 billion, and that's million with a "B," this war is over by the end of the month.
We make a deal with the Japanese, we give whatever they want and we come home, because you've seen them fight, and they sure as shit ain't giving up.
$14 billion.
The last three drives didn't make that much all together.
People on the street corners, they looked at this picture and they took hope.
Don't ask me why, I think it's a crappy picture myself.
You can't even see your faces.
But it said we can win this war, are winning this war, we just need you to dig a little deeper.
They want to give us that money.
No, they want to give it to you.
But you, you don't want to ask for it.
You don't want to give them hope.
You want to explain about this person and that flag.
Well, that's your choice.
Because if we admit we made a mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about and that will be that.
Gentlemen.
Mr. President, here they are.
- Well, hello.
Good to see you.
- Mr. President.
Darn good to see you, boys.
Heard you had a hell of a fight on your hands out there, hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation in Arizona, am I right?
Yes, Mr. President.
Being an Indian, you are a truer American than any of us.
Bet your people are proud to see you wear that uniform.
Very proud, sir.
They should be.
Well, I want to thank you for coming all this way to Washington to help us out.
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific now we need you to fight for a mountain of cash.
- And I don't expect you'll let us down.
- No, sir.
Good.
Go get it.
That's the end of this ceremony.
Let's take a look at this famous photo over here, see if I can pick you out.
My gosh.
There you are.
Boys.
Boys, this one's on me.
To those who can't be with us.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon.
May we have your autograph?
I suppose.
And your name is?
I don't know about you, but I get the impression
I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.
You're such a hero.
I feel honored to be in your presence.
That's just not true.
That's professional work.
Here, to professionals.
Here they are.
You're the guys in the photograph, right?
I heard you were on the train.
Let me shake your hands, John Tennack.
John Bradley.
These boys are with me, Harvard and Yale types, didn't fight a lick.
Pappies all rich sons-of-bitches.
Boys, shake hands with some real war heroes.
Excuse me for one moment.
You can buy them a drink while you're at it.
That's right.
Drinks for these men all the way around.
And you're the other one, aren't you?
John Tennack, Tennack Homes.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Pleased to meet you.
Have a drink, come on.
And here's my card.
Listen to me, Rene, when you get finished being famous you come see me because if you can sell bonds, you can sell homes.
Now, they're not gonna build homes anymore, they're gonna deliver them.
- You heard of prefab homes?
- No, sir.
Well, you will.
And you hang on to that card and you come see me, you hear?
- All right?
- Certainly will.
All right.
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?
If Mike and the guys could see us.
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it, would they?
Harlon!
Franklin!
Can you imagine Franklin on this train
eating at the dining car with all the silver?
We shouldn't be here, Doc.
There's gonna be a Hallelujah Day
When the boys have all come home to stay
And a million bands begin to play
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
And when we've lit the torch of liberty
In each blacked-out land across the sea
Ira!
Hey, Ira!
We heard the picture was posed!
What?
We heard you posed the picture!
Hey, Doc!
We're bigger than life, Doc!
And we'll heave a mighty sigh
When each gal can kiss the boy she kissed goodbye
And they'll come marching down Fifth Avenue
The United Nations in review
When this lovely dream has all come true
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
Good job.
Thank you.
Thank you, girls!
And now, here are the men you've been waiting to meet, the men in white.
Right behind me here, the heroes of Iwo Jima,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon,
Private First Class Ira Hayes, and Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley!
Thank you.
It's good of you people to come out tonight in support of the war effort.
We really need you to buy bonds, that's for sure.
'Cause we can't win the war without your help.
As far as us being the heroes of Iwo Jima, that's just not the case.
We really didn't do much at all.
Especially him.
Especially me.
I was just a runner.
That's it.
We put up a flag.
The pole we attached it to was heavy, so it took a number of us.
We had our picture taken doing it.
The real heroes are dead on that island.
And we'd appreciate it if you bought bonds in honor of them.
Thank you.
Jump on any grenades, Ira?
Take out any machine gun nests I missed?
At least I fired my weapon.
All right, knock it off.
You hit anything or were you too drunk then, too?
What?
Guys!
Come on!
Stop it.
Knock it off.
The tall man with the high hat will be coming down your way
Get your savings out when you hear him shout
"Any bonds today?"
Any bonds today?
Bonds of freedom that's what I'm selling
Any bonds today?
Rene, right here.
Sit between these two boys.
Here comes the freedom man
Asking you to buy a share of freedom today ... for us and they need our help.
And, if you think about it, I think you'll realize that buying more bonds is not just the right thing to do but the only thing to do.
Yes, this war has gone on too long.
We have given too many lives.
And its cost...
- Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
- Strawberry.
... has been far too high.
But if we waver now, if we don't dig deep and give more than we think we can then those sacrifices would be wasted...
Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
... and those lives lost in vain.
Let's move!
Go, go!
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over.
Where the hell are our tanks?
Stuck in the sand.
Captain says you're to go without them.
Christ.
That's real good work you're doing there, Rene.
All right, prepare to move out.
Pass the word.
Second Platoon!
Move!
Move!
Move!
All right, Second Platoon, on your feet!
Let's move out!
Jackass.
Let's move out!
Go, go!
Move, move, move!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Second Platoon, move out!
Doc!
Doc, get out of there!
Corpsman!
Doc!
Doc, get the hell out of there!
May I have your attention, please.
Train number 48 with service from New York City, Boston,
Rochester, New York,
Toledo, Ohio, and South Bend, Indiana is now arriving on Track 7.
Train number 48 now arriving on Track number 7.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.
- Come on, boys.
- Let's go.
- Watch your step, ma'am.
- Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the heroes of Iwo Jima.
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.
Private First Class Ira Hayes.
And Private First Class Rene Gagnon.
Rene!
That's my boyfriend!
Who the hell is that?
I don't know.
- Rene, is that your girl?
- Hey, what do they call you?
How about a photo?
Hey, look at that!
What's your name, doll?
What's your name?
Hey, she's a beauty.
Let's go find a saloon.
Smile, boys.
Give them their money's worth.
Hey, Doc, how's the tour going for you?
Thank you.
Where exactly are you staying?
- I'm not sure yet.
- Just forget about that.
Senator, I'd like you to meet Corpsman John Bradley.
- Doc, right?
- Yes, sir.
Nice to meet you, Senator.
Good to meet you, young man.
Now, we appreciate everything you've done and everything you're doing.
- Thank you, sir.
- Quite all right.
This is Captain White.
- Colonel Johns.
- We're proud of you, Corpsman.
And then Colonel McCourtney.
- Major General Green.
- Nice to meet you.
Senator, this is Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Of course!
Now I hear you used a tomahawk on those Japs.
Is that true, Chief?
No, sir.
Well, tell them you did, makes a better story, huh?
- Attaboy.
- This is Captain Green.
John?
Madeline Evelley.
I recognize you from all the photographs.
I'm Hank's mom.
It's so nice to meet you, ma'am.
Hank was always talking about you.
This is PFC Rene Gagnon.
Pleasure to meet you, son.
Thanks for everything.
- My pleasure.
- Not at all.
Ira, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Strank, Mike's mom.
It's all right.
When I got the telegram, I...
I don't know what I'm trying to say here.
Knowing he was with you that day and seeing him in that photograph,
I don't know why it makes me feel better, but it does.
- It's so silly, isn't it?
- No, it's not.
How are you, son?
Thank you very much.
We're the largest furniture wholesaler in Illinois.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
- I'll make sure he calls.
- Well, thank you.
Thank you.
Are you Rene?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Franklin's mother.
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.
I'm Pauline, Rene's girlfriend.
Would you mind?
Paper said that's Hank, and I honestly can't tell.
It's horrible of a mother not to know her own son, isn't it?
But that's him, isn't it?
Well, to be honest, ma'am, it happened so quick, and with everything that was going on it's kind of hard to remember who was where.
But...
Yeah, I think...
I think that's where he was.
That's Hank.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Excuse us.
Take him outside.
I'm Pauline.
- Very nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
He was the best Marine I ever knew.
Thank you.
- You okay, Chief?
- Oh, Christ!
I'm okay.
Yeah, you look it.
You're gonna screw this up, aren't you?
You're gonna screw it up for all of us.
I've got him.
Get some sleep, Ira.
- Mike?
- Yeah?
- You see this?
- What?
- Mike!
- Oh, shit, go!
He's killing me!
Hey, Doc, you think they got them all?
What?
Well, they're not shooting at us.
Maybe we killed them all.
Or they ran off in the night or something.
Or they're waiting for us to start climbing.
Third Platoon!
Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.
- Just us?
- Yeah, just us, lgg.
All right, Third Platoon, move!
I tag along?
Yeah, you can lead the way if you want.
Get a good shot of my face.
It's your ass I'm gonna make famous, Hank.
Hey, that'll work for me, too.
Lieutenant, if you make it to the top, put this up.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, Iggy.
They never shoot at the first patrol.
- They don't?
- No.
They want us to go up to the top, signal to the others that it's okay, then shoot everybody else as they come up the mountain.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Unless of course they want to make an example of us and discourage all the others.
I think you're full of crap, you know that, Hank?
Really?
Jesus.
Thank God that ain't us.
Told you.
Boots, spread them out and put them on a line.
Set up a perimeter!
First Squad!
- Hank?
Find me a pole.
- Yeah.
Let's put this flag up.
Watch it.
Right over here.
Right here.
That's good.
That's good.
Right here, right here.
Got that end?
Hold that steady.
Lindberg.
- Hey, who's got rope?
- Right here.
Give me something.
Yeah, good.
That work?
Do it, fellas.
Keep it coming.
USMC!
USMC!
Shit, look at that!
Jeez, look at that.
Get down!
Take cover!
Cover with that.30!
- Watch it!
Twenty yards down, Hank!
- You see them?
- I got about 20 yards, left side.
- Lindberg, get the flamethrower!
- Boots, you see them?
- Cover right!
- About 20 yards down!
Duck one!
- You see them?
Keep the cover on!
Second Squad, you see them?
Get me some grenades!
I see them!
You see them?
Right flank, over to the right!
Cover me, I'm going down!
Careful, Iggy.
Easy.
All clear!
Okay, guys, who wants to be famous?
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
- God damn it.
Strank!
- Sir?
They want a phone line run up to the top of the mountain.
Let me guess, they picked us.
Second Platoon, let's go.
Get some exercise.
Let's go!
Get off your ass.
Oh, shit!
Hope it still works, 'cause you're not getting mine!
- Get Forrestal!
- All right, then.
I don't know whose idea it was, Mr. Secretary.
Well, it was goddamn brilliant.
I want that flag, Holland.
Mark my words, raising that son-of-a-bitch means a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.
I want that flag.
Yes, sir.
I'll make sure no one touches it.
You can count on me.
Fuck that.
That flag belongs to the men in this battalion.
That son-of-a-bitch thinks that our men died taking this ground so we could hand over our flag to some politician to pin to his wall?
He's out of his goddamn mind!
Get me that flag, and find another one to replace it.
You've gotta be shitting me.
Gagnon!
Get your ass over here.
Hey.
Hi, fellas.
How's it going?
Missed a beautiful shot, Joe.
It's that kind of day.
- Hey, Mike.
- Hell of a view, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant!
Captain says he wants that flag.
He wants this flag?
Yes, sir.
- We just put the damn thing up.
- Yes, sir.
Some kind of flag shortage?
He wants you to put this one up instead.
Hey, Mike.
Do me a favor and put this up, will you?
Yes, sir.
All right, let's find a pole.
Take the flag down, boys.
Captain's orders.
You heard him, let's do it.
There you go.
Lordy, she's a heavy one.
All right, hang on.
Put this on.
One hell of a view, huh?
Good view from up here.
Yes, I'd say so myself.
All right.
- Not in your way here, am I, Joe?
- Nah, I'm fine, thanks.
Hey, Doc, you wanna give us a hand here?
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.
Ready?
Ready?
Let's go.
You get it?
I don't know.
I wish I could've seen their faces.
Nobody even noticed that second flag going up.
Everybody saw that damn picture and made up their own story about it.
But your dad and the others knew what they had done and what they had not done.
All your friends dying, it's hard not to be called a hero for saving somebody's life.
But for putting up a pole?
You gotta be kidding.
Hey!
It took a lot of talented folks a long time to make that thing.
Just wait till tonight when it's lit properly and there's thousands of cheering people in the stands.
It's gonna look a lot better.
So, stadium lights come down, spotlight comes up and you get your cue.
You charge up this thing with the flag, you plant it at the top.
You smile, you wave.
You know the drill.
You want us to plant the flag on a pile of papier-mâché.
Hey, that's show biz.
And try and stand how you stood the first time you planted it.
Just, you know, pretend the other three guys are with you.
The dead guys.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, not a problem.
Good.
But where do we imagine Hank is standing?
Sorry?
Well, seeing that he wasn't there, it'll be kind of hard for us to leave a space for him.
I think you know exactly where he was.
You pointed him out to his mother.
This is bullshit.
I planted that damn thing once, and I'm not doing it again.
- Hayes!
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
Hayes.
Hayes, get your ass back here or you're going on report.
Hayes!
You wanna do your damn job?
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Come on!
He's with me!
Hey, he's with me!
- Back off!
- Sir, he's with me.
Okay?
He's with me.
Ira, put the goddamn chair down!
- Put the chair down, son!
- Put the chair down, Ira!
Tell them drop their sticks!
Ira, they're cops, they're supposed to have nightsticks.
You're not supposed to be in the street swinging a chair.
- Calm down, son.
- Sir, turn around, please.
That poster right there?
The one on the end, that's him.
- That's him?
- Yes, sir.
You read the papers?
Christ.
We got another fucking hero.
Get him out of here.
- Can you do that?
- Yes, sir.
Put the goddamn chair down.
And let's go.
Did you start this?
He didn't serve me!
I don't make the rules.
We don't serve Indians.
He needs to go sleep it off.
Soldier Field.
You hear that?
What the hell is that?
I can't figure it out.
Keep an eye out.
It sounds like it's coming from up there.
They're using grenades.
They're killing themselves.
Ira, let's go.
Come on.
Let's go, Ira.
Come on.
Thank God.
Jesus.
Look at you, Chief.
You found him.
Holy shit.
You would have to pick today.
Vandegrift is here with enough brass to start a fucking band.
Come on, let's go.
Can you walk?
- Yes, sir.
- By yourself?
All right, look.
I don't care if you have to carry him get him to the top, plant that flag, and don't fucking fall off.
Get him in his stuff.
I'll stall these guys for as long as I can.
Hurry up.
Jesus Christ.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Cover!
Harlon!
Harlon!
Get your fire team up in that position!
O'Hare!
First Fire Team!
Work around!
BAR, you, on the side of the ridge!
Covering fire, boys, go, go, go!
Jackson, work your team around to the left!
Cover!
Left flank!
Left flank!
Franklin, Gust, go check it out!
Hustle up, boys!
We got them!
Clear!
One hell of an experience.
Move out!
Cease fire!
They're my men!
You're targeting our men!
You're targeting our...
Get me another radio!
Sergeant?
Sergeant!
Mike!
Mike, Mike, Mike.
Mike?
Mike.
Hey, where's Doc?
Corpsman!
Oh, shit.
How's his breathing?
Harlon, move, buddy.
Hey, Mike.
Mike, Mike, can you hear us?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on, Mike.
Mike?
Mike, can you hear us?
All right, let's go!
Move out!
I'm gonna get a stretcher.
Let's take him down, move him off the beach.
Ladies and gentlemen, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Corpsman!
Hank!
Hank!
Doc, they killed me.
Harlon!
Doc, they killed me.
Come on, Harlon.
Harlon, stay with me.
Franklin!
I'm fine, Ira.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Lggy!
Lggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Lggy!
Does it open?
Lggy!
Lggy!
Lggy, are you down there?
Lggy!
Can't tell who it is, but he's one of ours.
I had to go outside to throw up.
Look what they did to the poor son-of-a-bitch.
You okay, Chief?
Just let it go.
If that doesn't pry open their wallets, nothing will.
Jesus Christ, he's drunk.
Goddamn Indians.
Come on, Chief.
Let's get you home.
That's not what I hear.
I called around, I'm not stupid.
He's been drunk since he started this damn tour, making a spectacle of himself.
Just about choked that poor woman at the reception, blubbering.
Jesus Christ, you're supposed to be watching these men.
Yes, sir.
Well, he's making us look like regular asses.
Well, with all due respect, sir, he never wanted to come on this trip in the first place.
We had to pull him, kicking and screaming, off that boat.
He wants to be with his unit.
What unit?
They're all fucking dead.
This is how he honors those men?
By drinking and throwing up, and...
You know what?
He wants it, great, we'll send him back.
Get him packed and on a train today.
He's an embarrassment to the uniform.
Yes, sir.
I'll do it.
Yeah, no, that's...
That's good.
That's what I want.
I know it's a good thing, raising the money and that, 'cause we need it.
But,
I can't take them calling me a hero.
All I did was try not to get shot.
Some of the things I saw done, things I did,
they weren't things to be proud of, you know?
Mike...
Mike was a hero.
You ever meet him?
No.
Best Marine I ever met.
You know, Chief, I think if Mike was sitting here instead of you he'd be saying the same thing about himself,
not being a hero.
Maybe.
He was a good guy.
But I think that he would be ashamed of me, seeing me the way I am.
Think I could see my ma before they ship me off?
Think they'd do that?
See my ma?
I'm sorry, Ira.
We got stories now to tell our kids, I guess.
Keep your head down.
All aboard.
Good luck, Chief.
I think I saw him once after that.
It was maybe six or seven years after the war.
I was working as a salesman, doing a lot of driving.
I was driving west across Texas.
I was just trying to get where I was going so I could get home.
And I saw this guy hitchhiking on the side of the road.
And, for a second, I thought it might've been him.
I always regret that I didn't stop, but I was in a hurry.
And he was an Indian.
We always told the press that Ira insisted that he was going back to fight with his unit which was at least partially true, but
that isn't what got the headlines.
We're engaged.
Excuse me a minute, darling.
- Hey, Doc?
- Yeah?
- Got a minute?
- Yeah.
I'll see you at the car.
- You hear I'm getting married?
- I did, Rene.
That's great.
Yeah, it's something she wants.
She waited for me all this time.
She's not used to all this, but she's a good girl.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
So, I was wondering if you'd be my best man.
Me?
Don't you have somebody at home, a buddy, you'd rather ask?
Well, I didn't really make many.
The ones who didn't go, it's...
Well, it's hard to even talk to them.
You know?
Yeah, I know.
I'd be proud to.
Thank you.
I better go drag her away from them before she announces
I'm gonna be president of General Motors or something.
All right.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Rene, you're a lucky man.
- Big smile, Mrs. Gagnon!
- Say cheese!
I couldn't complain because the press loved them, so they wrote more articles and people bought more bonds.
The tour went on with just Rene and your dad.
And the true heroes are the men who didn't make it home from Iwo Jima, the men who died at Iwo Jima and in other campaigns.
We ask that you honor the memory of those men by buying the war bonds and helping us to win this war.
Thank you.
City after city, I thought the damn thing'd never end.
And this rumor kept going around that the photograph had been staged.
I remember your dad telling them that he wished he'd known he was having his picture taken because he would've ducked the hell out of it.
Whose idea was it?
Who wanted to stage the thing?
Come on, it was you?
Was there truth to the rumor that that picture was staged, Doc?
- Come on!
Doc?
- Can you answer that?
I remember when your dad got shot.
All hell was busting loose.
People back home saw that picture and thought it was over when we took Suribachi.
We wished.
Anyways, we're pinned down.
Mortars, shells, machine guns.
Fire coming from every which direction, right?
And we hear somebody call, "Corpsman down."
Corpsman down!
Blood was spurting out of his throat, and Doc was doing everything he could.
And the Corpsman looks up at him and he knows what this means, to be shot in the neck.
He knows he's dying, you can see that.
But still in his eyes, he's pleading with Doc to save his life.
And Doc can't.
- You okay, Doc?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah, you look fine.
- I'm okay.
Keep down, all right?
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.
Okay.
Corpsman.
Corpsman!
For God sake, Corpsman!
Corpsman?
Corpsman.
Incoming!
Let me see.
It's not that bad.
You're gonna be okay.
All right?
Just stay with me.
Look at me.
Took us a half-hour to find your dad.
He could've bled to death.
Coming down.
Thanks.
Vets'll tell you about being hit but not wanting to leave their buddies.
Usually, they're lying.
You'll take any excuse to get out of there.
But it happens.
You get the feeling you're letting them down.
I could see that in your dad's face.
He wanted to go, he'd seen enough.
But he didn't want to leave us.
Now, he was a hell of a good man, your dad.
Yeah.
While we were sitting there on the beach, we heard this great roar.
And we looked up.
That was the first of thousands of landings on Iwo.
- Look at that.
- Yeah.
How about that.
I'm gonna head back, all right?
Good luck.
That island saved a lot of lives.
A lot of lives.
I don't know what else to tell you.
After the bond tour my dad finally got his operation.
By the time he got home the war was over.
First thing he did was ask my mom to marry him.
Ira tried to get on with his life and put it all behind him.
Thank you for having me here today.
It's an honor to be in front of such a strong people.
Because of the war white men will understand Indians a lot better.
And it's going to be a better world.
But life had other plans for him.
You're...
You're him, aren't you?
You're the hero, right?
Great.
All right, kids, go get your picture taken.
Oh, that's great.
That's great.
All right, now say cheese.
Cheese!
That's great!
Okay.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Thanks.
- Come on.
- That's a hero, kids.
Hero, lift this basket, will you?
It's too heavy for me.
Rene tried to take advantage of those offers he'd received on the bond tour.
Yes.
G-A-G-N-O-N.
Right.
Pronounced Rene.
Rene, yes.
- Okay, I actually called last week.
- Yes.
Okay, yes.
Mr. Gagnon.
I gave Mr. Tennack your message.
I'm sure he'll call you.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
But he was yesterday's hero.
He even applied for a job at the local police station.
They said he wasn't qualified.
After working the factory with Pauline he tried a few things but spent the rest of his life as a janitor.
But Ira...
Ira!
You got a visitor.
Ira always made the news.
I could never find out why he did it, but one day Ira just took off.
He walked and hitched over 1,300 miles from Arizona to Texas.
He found Harlon Block's father working his field.
His wife, Belle, had left him soon after they discovered Harlon died.
She never forgave him for letting her son go off to war.
And Ira told him the truth, that it had been his son who raised the flag with them, his son in the photograph.
And then he just turned and walked away.
Though the flag-raising meant nothing to him, he somehow knew it would mean everything to them.
Thanks for calling.
Just as Belle knew all along.
The press soon found out and called Hank's mom with the news that it wasn't her son after all.
The last time they all saw each other was at the unveiling of the Marine Corps War Memorial.
And even though he planted the first flag above Iwo Jima,
Hank's mother and father weren't invited.
Ira.
It's good to see you, Ira.
Hell of a statue.
It wasn't long after that that they found Ira.
The papers said he died of exposure.
There was no autopsy.
It was about that same time when my father got in his car early one morning telling my mom he had something to do.
He drove to a town on the other side of Wisconsin where Iggy's mom lived.
Ever since she heard the news about her son she'd been trying to find out how he died, and no one would tell her.
I never found out what he told her, but I can pretty much guarantee it wasn't the truth.
My mother would ask him what was troubling him.
He would never say.
And every year, as it got close to Memorial Day, the reporters would start calling asking to interview my father.
No, I'm sorry.
He's fishing in Canada.
We were always instructed to say the same thing.
Okay.
Thanks.
When Mr. McCandless retired, my father bought the funeral home where he'd worked since coming home.
He spent the rest of his life running the business and raising his family.
He never spoke about the war or about the flag-raising, never told us anything.
The first time I heard any of these stories was after he died.
Where is he?
Oh, God.
He's not here, Dad.
He died.
Who?
Who died?
Lggy.
Iggy.
Christ, poor lggy.
I hadn't thought of him for years.
How do you know about Iggy?
You were calling for him, when you collapsed.
I wasn't looking for Iggy.
I was looking for you.
I wanted to...
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry I wasn't a better father.
Talked to you more.
I just...
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
You were the best father a man could have.
Did I ever tell you they took us swimming?
No, Dad.
After we planted the flag, we came down off the mountain and they let us swim.
It was the funniest thing.
All this fighting and we were jumping around in the water like kids.
That's the way I remember lggy now.
I finally came to the conclusion that maybe he was right.
Maybe there's no such thing as heroes.
Maybe there are just people like my dad.
I finally came to understand why they were so uncomfortable being called heroes.
Heroes are something we create, something we need.
It's a way for us to understand what is almost incomprehensible, how people could sacrifice so much for us.
But for my dad and these men, the risks they took, the wounds they suffered, they did that for their buddies.
They may have fought for their country, but they died for their friends.
For the man in front, for the man beside them.
And if we wish to truly honor these men, we should remember them the way they really were, the way my dad remembered them.
Come on, Doc!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
For God sakes!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Honey, what's wrong?
Every jackass thinks he knows what war is.
Especially those who've never been in one.
We like things nice and simple, good and evil, heroes and villains.
There's always plenty of both.
Most of the time, they are not who we think they are.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where...
Where is he?
Where is he?
Mr. Bradley?
Mr. B?
You okay?
- Where is he?
- Where is who?
Where is he?
Where did he go?
Where...
Where is he?
All right.
Just stay right here, okay?
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
It'll be okay.
Where is he?
Most guys I knew would never talk about what happened over there.
Probably 'cause they're still trying to forget about it.
They certainly didn't think of themselves as heroes.
They died without glory.
Nobody has taken their pictures.
Only their buddies knew what they did.
I'd tell their folks they died for their country.
I'm not sure that was it.
Now, there were plenty other photos taken that day, but none anybody wanted to see.
What we see and do in war, the cruelty, is unbelievable.
But somehow we gotta make some sense of it.
To do that, we need an easy to understand truth and damn few words.
Film's ruined.
I don't know.
This one looks all right.
And if you can get a picture...
Now, the right picture can win or lose a war.
You're gonna want to see this.
Look at Vietnam.
The picture of that South Vietnamese officer blowing that fella's brains out of the side of his head, whammo!
That was it.
The war was lost.
We just hung around trying to pretend it wasn't.
Took a lot of other pictures that day.
None of them made a difference.
Thanks.
Appreciate it.
Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.
Country was bankrupt.
People were becoming cynical and tired of war.
Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon!
Where?
Right there.
Planting that flag, that's your brother.
Ma, all you can see is his behind.
And that's his.
I powdered and diapered it, I know my son.
That's him.
Go get your father.
Daddy, Ma's got a picture of Harlon's keister in the paper.
You watch your mouth, young man.
Thank you.
One photo, almost all on its own, turned that around.
It's on the front page of every major paper.
Over 200 dailies and they're all flooded with requests for prints.
I think we might have found it.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- I gotta go get him.
- Oh, no, you don't.
Iggy, I gotta go.
I have a whole different theory.
He wants medical attention bad enough, he'll come to us.
Shut up and crawl over here, you lazy son-of-a-bitch!
As soon as that flare goes out.
- Crap.
Okay, well, I'll go with you.
- No.
You're actually gonna leave me here?
I'll be right back, just shoot some people.
I gotta go.
Oh, God.
Okay, it's okay.
Don't touch them.
Don't touch them.
Get your hands out of there.
Let me do that.
I'll do it, okay?
Don't look.
Keep your head back.
Keep your eyes on me.
All right, look at me.
I'll get it.
I'll take care of it.
We'll get this bandage on you.
We'll get you taken care of.
And we'll get you down to the bottom, all right?
Look, you're gonna be fine.
It's okay.
I'll do that.
I'll do that.
Here, put some pressure on that.
Put your hands on top and put some pressure on it.
Keep your head back.
Keep breathing.
Keep looking at me, all right?
Just keep looking at...
Doc.
Help me.
Help me.
All right.
Okay.
How's that feel?
- It feels good.
- It does?
All right.
- Good.
- All right.
I'm gonna go get a stretcher and get you down to the beach.
I'll be right back.
I'm all right.
Go and help someone who's hurt.
All right.
Hold on there.
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Holy shit.
They expect us to climb this?
Or something just like it.
So, where you think they're sending us?
I think it's the desert, Franklin.
Well, that makes no sense at all.
Well, it's just military psychology.
They always train you for the desert on a volcano.
Now you're just having fun with me.
Harlon, take your men right.
- Watch for Bedouins.
- Yes, sir.
- What's a Bedouin?
- It's a guy with a camel.
Well, Jeez Louise, maybe we are going to the desert.
Now, you tilt that to the right, but what if the bullet comes from the left?
Bullets don't come from the left.
You know any left-handed Japs?
That makes about as much sense as you showering with your shoes on.
You don't even know why you do it, do you?
'Cause I don't tell you mean I don't know?
You do it 'cause Mike does it.
I'll ask him.
So you cut hair back home?
Some.
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?
No, I just studied it a little.
But not in barber school?
Nope.
- Gosh.
- Let me guess, Hayes is winning.
Chief, I had very little to do with Sitting Bull's death, so maybe you could stop taking it out on me.
Different tribe.
The Pimas fought on the side of the white man.
- See, now that's smart.
- That is smart.
Yeah.
Worked real good for us.
Good luck, fellas.
Hey, good night, Lindberg.
Dead bodies.
He cuts hair on dead bodies.
What?
Even I knew that.
- Who's in?
- Oh, I'm in.
I'm in.
It must be a lot easier with them not moving around and all.
- There's that.
- Yeah.
You know what I been thinking?
Well, they been telling us we need to buddy up and I think we'd make pretty good buddies.
And how do you figure that?
Well, you know, in that we have a lot in common.
So, why do you cut dead people's hair, anyway?
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.
You tell a lot of people that?
You actually chose the Marines because they got the best uniform?
No sense being a hero if you don't look like one.
Jacks.
Queens.
Shit.
Do anything on that reservation but play cards, Chief?
All right, listen up, you sorry bunch of leathernecks!
We practice going over the side tomorrow which means we ain't long for this piece of rock.
All right!
One more thing, any man who doesn't have his masturbation papers in order better get them signed by tomorrow night or he ain't going overseas.
- I got mine already.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm square.
Wait.
Why am I just hearing about this?
That's horseshit, Franklin.
I don't have to repeat everything twice for you.
No, I didn't hear nothing about no masturbating papers.
Heard they were running short.
You know, nobody tells me nothing.
That's real nice, guys.
All right, get your ass over to the officer in charge of records.
Maybe he got some more left.
- Leave your smokes.
I'll play for you.
- Thanks, Mike.
Listen, he calls you an idiot, you take it like a man, okay?
Just do not leave without signing them.
- I appreciate it, Sergeant.
- You got it.
What the hell happened to your hair, Rene?
Look like a goddamn corpse.
Three points of contact on that rope at all times.
Next four.
Over the side.
Let's go.
Keep moving.
Next four, over the side.
Just keep your eye on the guy below you.
That's all you gotta look at.
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.
Keep three points of contact on the rope at all times.
You see?
No big thing.
Just one step at a time and keep your hands on the vertical rope.
Remember, once you're in the boat move away from the rope.
Just make sure you keep three points of contact on the rope.
I got him!
All right, get that man out of the water.
Give me a hand.
Grab his pack.
Don't worry about him, Doc.
All right, quit skylarking!
Keep it moving!
He'll be fine.
Our target, Island X, is an ugly, smelly, dirty little scab of rock called Iwo Jima.
It means "Sulfur Island," which accounts for the smell.
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop, you ask me.
After 20 straight days of bombing you won't find a blade of grass or a twig on it.
It wasn't that pretty to start with.
Captain?
Iwo's just five-and-a-half miles long, two-and-a-half wide.
There's a lump down at the bottom.
That's Mount Suribachi.
On the maps in front of you the island is white.
Not much of it.
The black dots represent known enemy emplacements.
Coastal defense guns, dual-mount dual-purpose guns, covered artillery emplacements.
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes, and earth-covered structures.
I don't see any barracks or any other structures.
That's right.
And we still don't know why.
Now, this isn't just any island to them.
This isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, or Saipan.
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders in eight square miles.
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.
It's up to us to convince them.
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.
The 8th Ammo Company will land here to re-supply.
The Suribachi's guns are the biggest problem.
They can hit any point on the island.
We're sitting ducks until we take them out.
That's our job.
We cut across the island, right at the base, slit its throat, lop off its head.
And we take that mountain.
We take that mountain, we take their big guns.
We take their eyes.
Okay, I'm heading in.
Follow me.
Let's put a good show on for the Marines.
Close it up.
Take it right down to the deck.
Yeah, boys!
Man overboard portside!
See him?
Throw me a line!
He's right there.
- Where is he?
- Watch out, watch out, watch out.
Hawaii's that way!
Just keep paddling, Mac, we'll catch you on the way back!
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!
They're not gonna stop.
What?
None of them are.
They can't.
So much for "No man left behind."
- Sir.
- Come on in.
Look, I've had to make a few other changes.
I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
- You bet.
Trouble is, I already told my men I'd see them through this.
That your James Cagney impersonation?
'Cause I've heard better.
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.
Look, this isn't your first time through this.
- You don't need to prove anything.
- No, sir.
You're not the best sergeant I've ever had, you're just the best one that's still walking.
- Block's a good man.
- Yes, sir, he is.
The men know him, he can step right in.
You know, I have actually thought this through.
Platoon sergeant puts you further away from the bullets.
I already gave them my word, sir.
I told them I'd bring them all home to their mothers which means I already lied to half of them.
Can't lie to the rest.
- How are your men?
- They'll do fine.
Except maybe Gagnon.
Our own Tyrone Power?
Yes, sir.
He's a good man, just might be better use further back from the lines.
I'll use him as a runner.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
Now get out of here.
Hear the good news, Doc?
We're going in with the first waves.
Hey, you do that again I'll take your head off!
Fucking dominoes.
Iggy, have you ever heard news you considered to be bad?
The first ones off the ship, Doc.
Means we don't go over the side of the ship.
We hop on a tractor, they drive us right there.
Oh, shit, that is good news.
You see?
What'd I tell you?
What's going on?
Look at that.
We're killing them!
We're killing them, Doc.
I was promised 10 days of shelling.
You're giving me three and saying that's the best you can do?
I don't give a shit!
My men hit that beach with less than 10 and I'll be taking them home to their mamas in buckets!
Yeah, I know exactly why.
Because every Navy man with a scrambled egg on his chest wants to offload us here and sail to Japan so they can be there for the big finish, tell their kids they captured the Emperor all by themselves.
Well, you aren't going to Japan unless we take this piece of shit island!
These little pricks are dug in!
Okay, appreciate that, Jim.
Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
I'm okay.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
Jesus, Iggy, just leave me alone, all right?
How about you guys?
Knife?
Bayonet?
Kick in the ass?
How about you, Doc?
Sharpen your knife?
You sharpened it three times already.
Well, then I better make sure I didn't nick it.
Good man, Doc.
- Hey, Doc.
- Yeah.
When we land, try not to wave this kit around too much.
They got sharpshooters that are trained to look for them.
And they know that if they take out a corpsman another dozen Marines will die unattended.
All right?
Okay, Mike.
Yeah, right there.
Close the damn door.
For God's sake.
Yeah, like that's gonna help.
That your girlfriend, Chief?
Bet she's a pretty damn good-looking squaw.
Bet you're missing her, and that little wigwam of yours.
Welcome, all Marines off Iwo Jima.
We have a long-time wait...
It's what they do to prisoners,
- at least the lucky ones.
- Jesus.
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think about waving a white bandanna.
Poor Marines, so far from home for no good reason.
Think of your girls back home, waiting for you.
But a girl cannot stay home every night.
So who do you think they're with tonight?
And will she let him kiss her?
And will he comfort her at your funeral?
This sweet music is to make you think of your girls back home who are missing you.
This is all for now.
I'll see you tomorrow night.
Gunners!
Move, let's go!
Let's go, get up on the berm!
Gunners!
We're clear!
Get up the berm!
Baker Company, move out!
- Seen Second Platoon?
- I don't see them.
First Squad, move it out!
God, this place reeks.
- Go, go, go!
- Move out!
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go!
Go!
Go, go!
Drop your packs!
Go!
All clear!
- Jesus, you needed some exercise?
- He got lost.
A hundred landing craft heading for one beach and this guy gets lost.
Now I'm glad we did.
Jesus, what a mess.
Any theories why they ain't shooting?
It's getting on my nerves.
Maybe they're all dead.
What do you think, Doc?
You think they're all dead?
Mike, take six men and bring that gun onto the beach.
Second Platoon, let's move out!
Stay down.
Come on.
Move!
Move!
- Get down!
- Take cover!
Move out!
Cover fire!
Pour it on!
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!
Corpsman!
I'm gonna sling your arm and then I'll give you a shot for the pain!
Move, move!
Off the beach!
Take cover!
You got a girl back home, Marine?
We're gonna make sure she sees you, all right?
I need pressure on this wound!
Where's the fire coming from?
Where are they?
Look for a flash, shoot at it!
Let's go, let...
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!
You're over!
Third Squad, forward!
Move!
Where are they, sir?
We got ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock, pillbox!
Sergeant!
- Sergeant!
I think I can clear that out.
- What?
All right, you go.
Here.
Take these.
Check your weapon.
Yeah?
Go!
Cover!
Cover him!
Cover, cover!
Son-of-a-bitch.
Let's go!
Go!
Move it out!
Go, go, go!
Down, down, down!
It's clear.
Good work.
I thought you said it was clear!
It was!
Shit, I guess they're not in there firing at us then.
Lindberg!
Yeah!
Light it up!
I'll cover you, Ice!
Don't cover shit!
There's already enough people shooting!
One bullet and this thing goes up like a Roman candle!
Go!
Shift fire!
Shift your fire!
Go, go!
Shift your fire!
Shift your fire!
Go!
Move it out!
Hit the deck!
Stay down!
Wait for support!
Is this a bad battle or what?
It's a fucking slaughter.
Christ Jesus!
Get a machine gun team set up over here, now!
Thank God!
Tanks!
Runner!
Get those tanks up here!
Oh, shit.
Get down!
Corporal, watch your left flank!
Let's go without them!
Move out!
Move out!
Iggy, you gotta lift your side, he's gonna roll off.
Got it, Doc!
Incoming!
Move, move, move, move!
Keep moving!
Get that LVT up on the beach!
Keep moving!
You're next, pal, we're getting you out of here.
Move it!
Great news.
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa, 'cause that's where we're headed.
Not you and me.
Captain Severance asked me who else was in that picture, and Christ if I could remember, but it was Mike and Doc and Franklin and me and Hank Hansen but I just remembered, you were there, too.
I wasn't there.
'Course you were.
Neither was Hank.
He raised the first flag.
It was Harlon Block that raised that one.
Shit.
I told them it was Hank.
You weren't there, Mr. Smart Ass, how'd you know it was Harlon?
- You tell them it was me?
- No.
Like I said, I just remembered.
Good, keep your mouth shut.
They know there was somebody else, you can see it in the picture.
Then pick someone dead.
They don't want somebody dead, you dumb redskin, they want to ship us back to the States.
What did I tell you?
I wasn't there.
- You hear?
- All right.
Just settle down.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're not going anywhere.
Who the hell says?
This is horseshit.
You wounded, son?
No, sir.
Well, did you take out a nest of Japs butt-naked with your bare hands?
'Cause if I'm gonna give up my seat to a hero he better have a good goddamn story to tell.
No, sir.
Then enjoy it, 'cause they'll forget you before Christmas.
The sixth man, you got a name?
Sorry, still don't remember.
It's a damn shame, 'cause I promised the Major you'd know who it was.
Fact, you not knowing throws a doubt on you being one of the flag-raisers yourself.
Since no one wants to be embarrassed, the moment you land they'll turn you around, ship you off to Okinawa in time to meet your buddies on the beach.
So, why don't you stop screwing with me?
Give me a damn name.
Gangway!
Gangway!
Let's go, let's go!
Gangway!
Where the hell is that son-of-a-bitch?
Hayes!
Hayes?
Hayes, get your red ass over here!
Make me look like I don't know what my own men are doing with a flag the size of my mother's house?
God damn it, Ira, you shouldn't have lied to me.
You made me look like a complete asshole.
We're gonna miss you around here.
Good luck.
Now your name's in the paper, too.
Just heard your doctor say we're postponing your operation.
You're being shipped back to the mainland.
Everybody who saw that picture thought planting the flag meant victory.
That's all they wanted to know.
Victory.
Within a few weeks of that picture being taken, half the men in it were dead.
Mrs. Hansen!
Mrs. Hansen!
Did you know Hank was a hero?
- Are you proud of him, Mrs. Hansen?
- What was he like as a boy?
Look this way, please, ma'am.
What do you have to say about your son?
But somehow being a part of it meant something.
Looking at it, you could believe their sacrifice was not a waste.
Yeah, I might have thought that was Harlon, too.
It is.
Belle, their names are right here.
It's not him.
And he would be alive and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.
You think about that when you look at his picture, Ed.
And I need to rush home and change because there's the Governor's banquet and then there's the parade.
Imagine, the Governor is coming here to meet us.
Now, I'm wearing blue so, if...
- Are you going to change?
- We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin from CBS World News.
A press association has just announced that President Roosevelt is dead.
The President died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
All we know so far is that the President died at Warm Springs in Georgia.
Further updates every hour.
Temperatures will remain the same today, in the mid-30s to low 40s with clear skies.
Hello?
Yes.
Of course.
No, we understand.
It wouldn't be right.
Thank you.
Here he is, gentlemen.
Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.
Senator Haddigan.
I'd like you to meet Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Damn good to meet you.
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.
Sorry?
That's Pima Indian talk, boy, don't you know your own language?
Took forever to memorize the damn gibberish.
Sorry, I've been away from the reservation too long, Senator.
- Doc.
- Ira.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
- That's you.
- Go, go, go, go.
Go.
Please welcome
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley,
Private First Class Ira Hayes,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon!
Holy shit.
Come in, come in, come in.
Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Bud Gurber.
- You showing the boys the sights?
- We saw a hell of a ball game.
That's great.
The bar's there, help yourself.
I got some briefing sheets for you here, just some simple things we want you to say.
Mostly, "Buy bonds," can't say that too often.
Itineraries, those are changing every couple minutes.
Everybody wants to meet you guys.
I got women sending up envelopes with stockings in them, notes written in lipstick.
We won't mention that to the press, am I right?
Have a drink, for Christ's sake.
My God, what you boys must have seen over there.
I've been watching the newsreels.
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.
So, we got a hell of a lot of money to raise, not a lot of time.
White House tomorrow, then we trot you over to shake hands with a couple of hundred Congressmen who won't pull a penny out of their pockets.
Politicians and actors.
You put them in a restaurant together, they'd die of old age before picking up the check.
Then New York City, Times Square, dinners with various hoi polloi, then Chicago...
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?
That's what we're calling the mothers of the dead flag-raisers.
You present each mother with a flag, they say a few words, people will shit money.
It'll be so moving.
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.
Lovely woman.
She knows how close you and her son were.
He wrote home about you.
She is very, very much looking forward to meeting you.
Hank wasn't in the picture.
Sorry?
Hank didn't raise that flag.
He raised the other one, the real flag.
The what?
The real...
The real flag?
There's a real flag?
Yeah, ours was the replacement flag.
We put it up when they took the other one down.
Am I the only one getting a headache here?
You know about this?
It was after it was already in the papers.
The mothers had already been told, but...
That's it, that's beautiful.
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Yeah, why tell me?
I'm only the guy that has to explain it to 150 million Americans.
Who is in the goddamn picture?
Are any of you guys in the goddamn picture?
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.
Six guys raising a flag over Iwo Jima.
Victory is ours.
You're three of them, right?
This was the fifth day, sir.
The battle went on for 35 more.
Well, what'd you do, raise a goddamn flag every time you stopped for lunch?
Can I hit this guy?
You know what, I don't give a shit, you're in the picture, you raised the flag, that's the story we're selling, boys.
Are you deaf?
Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?
Harlon Block.
That's whose mother should be here if anyone's should be.
You know, I think this whole damn thing is a farce, you ask me.
You know what they're calling this bond drive?
The Mighty Seventh.
They might've called it the
"We're Flat Fucking Broke And Can't Even Afford Bullets
"So We're Begging For Your Pennies" bond drive, but it didn't have quite the ring.
They could've called it that, though, because the last four bond drives came up so short we just printed money instead.
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street, he'll tell you our dollar is next to worthless, we borrowed so much.
And nobody is lending any more.
Ships aren't being built.
Tanks aren't being built.
Machine guns, bazookas, hand grenades, zip.
You think this is a farce?
You want to go back to your buddies?
Well, stuff some rocks in your pockets before you get on the plane because that's all we got left to throw at the Japanese.
And don't be surprised if your plane doesn't make it off the runway because the fuel dumps are empty.
And our good friends, the Arabs, are only taking bullion.
If we don't raise $14 billion, and that's million with a "B," this war is over by the end of the month.
We make a deal with the Japanese, we give whatever they want and we come home, because you've seen them fight, and they sure as shit ain't giving up.
$14 billion.
The last three drives didn't make that much all together.
People on the street corners, they looked at this picture and they took hope.
Don't ask me why, I think it's a crappy picture myself.
You can't even see your faces.
But it said we can win this war, are winning this war, we just need you to dig a little deeper.
They want to give us that money.
No, they want to give it to you.
But you, you don't want to ask for it.
You don't want to give them hope.
You want to explain about this person and that flag.
Well, that's your choice.
Because if we admit we made a mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about and that will be that.
Gentlemen.
Mr. President, here they are.
- Well, hello.
Good to see you.
- Mr. President.
Darn good to see you, boys.
Heard you had a hell of a fight on your hands out there, hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation in Arizona, am I right?
Yes, Mr. President.
Being an Indian, you are a truer American than any of us.
Bet your people are proud to see you wear that uniform.
Very proud, sir.
They should be.
Well, I want to thank you for coming all this way to Washington to help us out.
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific now we need you to fight for a mountain of cash.
- And I don't expect you'll let us down.
- No, sir.
Good.
Go get it.
That's the end of this ceremony.
Let's take a look at this famous photo over here, see if I can pick you out.
My gosh.
There you are.
Boys.
Boys, this one's on me.
To those who can't be with us.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon.
May we have your autograph?
I suppose.
And your name is?
I don't know about you, but I get the impression
I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.
You're such a hero.
I feel honored to be in your presence.
That's just not true.
That's professional work.
Here, to professionals.
Here they are.
You're the guys in the photograph, right?
I heard you were on the train.
Let me shake your hands, John Tennack.
John Bradley.
These boys are with me, Harvard and Yale types, didn't fight a lick.
Pappies all rich sons-of-bitches.
Boys, shake hands with some real war heroes.
Excuse me for one moment.
You can buy them a drink while you're at it.
That's right.
Drinks for these men all the way around.
And you're the other one, aren't you?
John Tennack, Tennack Homes.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Pleased to meet you.
Have a drink, come on.
And here's my card.
Listen to me, Rene, when you get finished being famous you come see me because if you can sell bonds, you can sell homes.
Now, they're not gonna build homes anymore, they're gonna deliver them.
- You heard of prefab homes?
- No, sir.
Well, you will.
And you hang on to that card and you come see me, you hear?
- All right?
- Certainly will.
All right.
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?
If Mike and the guys could see us.
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it, would they?
Harlon!
Franklin!
Can you imagine Franklin on this train
eating at the dining car with all the silver?
We shouldn't be here, Doc.
There's gonna be a Hallelujah Day
When the boys have all come home to stay
And a million bands begin to play
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
And when we've lit the torch of liberty
In each blacked-out land across the sea
Ira!
Hey, Ira!
We heard the picture was posed!
What?
We heard you posed the picture!
Hey, Doc!
We're bigger than life, Doc!
And we'll heave a mighty sigh
When each gal can kiss the boy she kissed goodbye
And they'll come marching down Fifth Avenue
The United Nations in review
When this lovely dream has all come true
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
Good job.
Thank you.
Thank you, girls!
And now, here are the men you've been waiting to meet, the men in white.
Right behind me here, the heroes of Iwo Jima,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon,
Private First Class Ira Hayes, and Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley!
Thank you.
It's good of you people to come out tonight in support of the war effort.
We really need you to buy bonds, that's for sure.
'Cause we can't win the war without your help.
As far as us being the heroes of Iwo Jima, that's just not the case.
We really didn't do much at all.
Especially him.
Especially me.
I was just a runner.
That's it.
We put up a flag.
The pole we attached it to was heavy, so it took a number of us.
We had our picture taken doing it.
The real heroes are dead on that island.
And we'd appreciate it if you bought bonds in honor of them.
Thank you.
Jump on any grenades, Ira?
Take out any machine gun nests I missed?
At least I fired my weapon.
All right, knock it off.
You hit anything or were you too drunk then, too?
What?
Guys!
Come on!
Stop it.
Knock it off.
The tall man with the high hat will be coming down your way
Get your savings out when you hear him shout
"Any bonds today?"
Any bonds today?
Bonds of freedom that's what I'm selling
Any bonds today?
Rene, right here.
Sit between these two boys.
Here comes the freedom man
Asking you to buy a share of freedom today ...for us and they need our help.
And, if you think about it, I think you'll realize that buying more bonds is not just the right thing to do but the only thing to do.
Yes, this war has gone on too long.
We have given too many lives.
And its cost...
- Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
- Strawberry.
...has been far too high.
But if we waver now, if we don't dig deep and give more than we think we can then those sacrifices would be wasted...
Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
...and those lives lost in vain.
Let's move!
Go, go!
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over.
Where the hell are our tanks?
Stuck in the sand.
Captain says you're to go without them.
Christ.
That's real good work you're doing there, Rene.
All right, prepare to move out.
Pass the word.
Second Platoon!
Move!
Move!
Move!
All right, Second Platoon, on your feet!
Let's move out!
Jackass.
Let's move out!
Go, go!
Move, move, move!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Second Platoon, move out!
Doc!
Doc, get out of there!
Corpsman!
Doc!
Doc, get the hell out of there!
May I have your attention, please.
Train number 48 with service from New York City, Boston,
Rochester, New York,
Toledo, Ohio, and South Bend, Indiana is now arriving on Track 7.
Train number 48 now arriving on Track number 7.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.
- Come on, boys.
- Let's go.
- Watch your step, ma'am.
- Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the heroes of Iwo Jima.
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.
Private First Class Ira Hayes.
And Private First Class Rene Gagnon.
Rene!
That's my boyfriend!
Who the hell is that?
I don't know.
- Rene, is that your girl?
- Hey, what do they call you?
How about a photo?
Hey, look at that!
What's your name, doll?
What's your name?
Hey, she's a beauty.
Let's go find a saloon.
Smile, boys.
Give them their money's worth.
Hey, Doc, how's the tour going for you?
Thank you.
Where exactly are you staying?
- I'm not sure yet.
- Just forget about that.
Senator, I'd like you to meet Corpsman John Bradley.
- Doc, right?
- Yes, sir.
Nice to meet you, Senator.
Good to meet you, young man.
Now, we appreciate everything you've done and everything you're doing.
- Thank you, sir.
- Quite all right.
This is Captain White.
- Colonel Johns.
- We're proud of you, Corpsman.
And then Colonel McCourtney.
- Major General Green.
- Nice to meet you.
Senator, this is Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Of course!
Now I hear you used a tomahawk on those Japs.
Is that true, Chief?
No, sir.
Well, tell them you did, makes a better story, huh?
- Attaboy.
- This is Captain Green.
John?
Madeline Evelley.
I recognize you from all the photographs.
I'm Hank's mom.
It's so nice to meet you, ma'am.
Hank was always talking about you.
This is PFC Rene Gagnon.
Pleasure to meet you, son.
Thanks for everything.
- My pleasure.
- Not at all.
Ira, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Strank, Mike's mom.
It's all right.
When I got the telegram, I...
I don't know what I'm trying to say here.
Knowing he was with you that day and seeing him in that photograph,
I don't know why it makes me feel better, but it does.
- It's so silly, isn't it?
- No, it's not.
How are you, son?
Thank you very much.
We're the largest furniture wholesaler in Illinois.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
- I'll make sure he calls.
- Well, thank you.
Thank you.
Are you Rene?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Franklin's mother.
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.
I'm Pauline, Rene's girlfriend.
Would you mind?
Paper said that's Hank, and I honestly can't tell.
It's horrible of a mother not to know her own son, isn't it?
But that's him, isn't it?
Well, to be honest, ma'am, it happened so quick, and with everything that was going on it's kind of hard to remember who was where.
But...
Yeah, I think...
I think that's where he was.
That's Hank.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Excuse us.
Take him outside.
I'm Pauline.
- Very nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
He was the best Marine I ever knew.
Thank you.
- You okay, Chief?
- Oh, Christ!
I'm okay.
Yeah, you look it.
You're gonna screw this up, aren't you?
You're gonna screw it up for all of us.
I've got him.
Get some sleep, Ira.
- Mike?
- Yeah?
- You see this?
- What?
- Mike!
- Oh, shit, go!
He's killing me!
Hey, Doc, you think they got them all?
What?
Well, they're not shooting at us.
Maybe we killed them all.
Or they ran off in the night or something.
Or they're waiting for us to start climbing.
Third Platoon!
Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.
- Just us?
- Yeah, just us, Igg.
All right, Third Platoon, move!
I tag along?
Yeah, you can lead the way if you want.
Get a good shot of my face.
It's your ass I'm gonna make famous, Hank.
Hey, that'll work for me, too.
Lieutenant, if you make it to the top, put this up.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, Iggy.
They never shoot at the first patrol.
- They don't?
- No.
They want us to go up to the top, signal to the others that it's okay, then shoot everybody else as they come up the mountain.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Unless of course they want to make an example of us and discourage all the others.
I think you're full of crap, you know that, Hank?
Really?
Jesus.
Thank God that ain't us.
Told you.
Boots, spread them out and put them on a line.
Set up a perimeter!
First Squad!
- Hank?
Find me a pole.
- Yeah.
Let's put this flag up.
Watch it.
Right over here.
Right here.
That's good.
That's good.
Right here, right here.
Got that end?
Hold that steady.
Lindberg.
- Hey, who's got rope?
- Right here.
Give me something.
Yeah, good.
That work?
Do it, fellas.
Keep it coming.
USMC!
USMC!
Shit, look at that!
Jeez, look at that.
Get down!
Take cover!
Cover with that. 30!
- Watch it!
Twenty yards down, Hank!
- You see them?
- I got about 20 yards, left side.
- Lindberg, get the flamethrower!
- Boots, you see them?
- Cover right!
- About 20 yards down!
Duck one!
- You see them?
Keep the cover on!
Second Squad, you see them?
Get me some grenades!
I see them!
You see them?
Right flank, over to the right!
Cover me, I'm going down!
Careful, Iggy.
Easy.
All clear!
Okay, guys, who wants to be famous?
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
- God damn it.
Strank!
- Sir?
They want a phone line run up to the top of the mountain.
Let me guess, they picked us.
Second Platoon, let's go.
Get some exercise.
Let's go!
Get off your ass.
Oh, shit!
Hope it still works, 'cause you're not getting mine!
- Get Forrestal!
- All right, then.
I don't know whose idea it was, Mr. Secretary.
Well, it was goddamn brilliant.
I want that flag, Holland.
Mark my words, raising that son-of-a-bitch means a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.
I want that flag.
Yes, sir.
I'll make sure no one touches it.
You can count on me.
Fuck that.
That flag belongs to the men in this battalion.
That son-of-a-bitch thinks that our men died taking this ground so we could hand over our flag to some politician to pin to his wall?
He's out of his goddamn mind!
Get me that flag, and find another one to replace it.
You've gotta be shitting me.
Gagnon!
Get your ass over here.
Hey.
Hi, fellas.
How's it going?
Missed a beautiful shot, Joe.
It's that kind of day.
- Hey, Mike.
- Hell of a view, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant!
Captain says he wants that flag.
He wants this flag?
Yes, sir.
- We just put the damn thing up.
- Yes, sir.
Some kind of flag shortage?
He wants you to put this one up instead.
Hey, Mike.
Do me a favor and put this up, will you?
Yes, sir.
All right, let's find a pole.
Take the flag down, boys.
Captain's orders.
You heard him, let's do it.
There you go.
Lordy, she's a heavy one.
All right, hang on.
Put this on.
One hell of a view, huh?
Good view from up here.
Yes, I'd say so myself.
All right.
- Not in your way here, am I, Joe?
- Nah, I'm fine, thanks.
Hey, Doc, you wanna give us a hand here?
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.
Ready?
Ready?
Let's go.
You get it?
I don't know.
I wish I could've seen their faces.
Nobody even noticed that second flag going up.
Everybody saw that damn picture and made up their own story about it.
But your dad and the others knew what they had done and what they had not done.
All your friends dying, it's hard not to be called a hero for saving somebody's life.
But for putting up a pole?
You gotta be kidding.
Hey!
It took a lot of talented folks a long time to make that thing.
Just wait till tonight when it's lit properly and there's thousands of cheering people in the stands.
It's gonna look a lot better.
So, stadium lights come down, spotlight comes up and you get your cue.
You charge up this thing with the flag, you plant it at the top.
You smile, you wave.
You know the drill.
You want us to plant the flag on a pile of papier-mâché.
Hey, that's show biz.
And try and stand how you stood the first time you planted it.
Just, you know, pretend the other three guys are with you.
The dead guys.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, not a problem.
Good.
But where do we imagine Hank is standing?
Sorry?
Well, seeing that he wasn't there, it'll be kind of hard for us to leave a space for him.
I think you know exactly where he was.
You pointed him out to his mother.
This is bullshit.
I planted that damn thing once, and I'm not doing it again.
- Hayes!
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
Hayes.
Hayes, get your ass back here or you're going on report.
Hayes!
You wanna do your damn job?
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Come on!
He's with me!
Hey, he's with me!
- Back off!
- Sir, he's with me.
Okay?
He's with me.
Ira, put the goddamn chair down!
- Put the chair down, son!
- Put the chair down, Ira!
Tell them drop their sticks!
Ira, they're cops, they're supposed to have nightsticks.
You're not supposed to be in the street swinging a chair.
- Calm down, son.
- Sir, turn around, please.
That poster right there?
The one on the end, that's him.
- That's him?
- Yes, sir.
You read the papers?
Christ.
We got another fucking hero.
Get him out of here.
- Can you do that?
- Yes, sir.
Put the goddamn chair down.
And let's go.
Did you start this?
He didn't serve me!
I don't make the rules.
We don't serve Indians.
He needs to go sleep it off.
Soldier Field.
You hear that?
What the hell is that?
I can't figure it out.
Keep an eye out.
It sounds like it's coming from up there.
They're using grenades.
They're killing themselves.
Ira, let's go.
Come on.
Let's go, Ira.
Come on.
Thank God.
Jesus.
Look at you, Chief.
You found him.
Holy shit.
You would have to pick today.
Vandegrift is here with enough brass to start a fucking band.
Come on, let's go.
Can you walk?
- Yes, sir.
- By yourself?
All right, look.
I don't care if you have to carry him get him to the top, plant that flag, and don't fucking fall off.
Get him in his stuff.
I'll stall these guys for as long as I can.
Hurry up.
Jesus Christ.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Cover!
Harlon!
Harlon!
Get your fire team up in that position!
O'Hare!
First Fire Team!
Work around!
BAR, you, on the side of the ridge!
Covering fire, boys, go, go, go!
Jackson, work your team around to the left!
Cover!
Left flank!
Left flank!
Franklin, Gust, go check it out!
Hustle up, boys!
We got them!
Clear!
One hell of an experience.
Move out!
Cease fire!
They're my men!
You're targeting our men!
You're targeting our...
Get me another radio!
Sergeant?
Sergeant!
Mike!
Mike, Mike, Mike.
Mike?
Mike.
Hey, where's Doc?
Corpsman!
Oh, shit.
How's his breathing?
Harlon, move, buddy.
Hey, Mike.
Mike, Mike, can you hear us?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on, Mike.
Mike?
Mike, can you hear us?
All right, let's go!
Move out!
I'm gonna get a stretcher.
Let's take him down, move him off the beach.
Ladies and gentlemen, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Corpsman!
Hank!
Hank!
Doc, they killed me.
Harlon!
Doc, they killed me.
Come on, Harlon.
Harlon, stay with me.
Franklin!
I'm fine, Ira.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Does it open?
Iggy!
Iggy!
Iggy, are you down there?
Iggy!
Can't tell who it is, but he's one of ours.
I had to go outside to throw up.
Look what they did to the poor son-of-a-bitch.
You okay, Chief?
Just let it go.
If that doesn't pry open their wallets, nothing will.
Jesus Christ, he's drunk.
Goddamn Indians.
Come on, Chief.
Let's get you home.
That's not what I hear.
I called around, I'm not stupid.
He's been drunk since he started this damn tour, making a spectacle of himself.
Just about choked that poor woman at the reception, blubbering.
Jesus Christ, you're supposed to be watching these men.
Yes, sir.
Well, he's making us look like regular asses.
Well, with all due respect, sir, he never wanted to come on this trip in the first place.
We had to pull him, kicking and screaming, off that boat.
He wants to be with his unit.
What unit?
They're all fucking dead.
This is how he honors those men?
By drinking and throwing up, and...
You know what?
He wants it, great, we'll send him back.
Get him packed and on a train today.
He's an embarrassment to the uniform.
Yes, sir.
I'll do it.
Yeah, no, that's...
That's good.
That's what I want.
I know it's a good thing, raising the money and that, 'cause we need it.
But,
I can't take them calling me a hero.
All I did was try not to get shot.
Some of the things I saw done, things I did,
they weren't things to be proud of, you know?
Mike...
Mike was a hero.
You ever meet him?
No.
Best Marine I ever met.
You know, Chief, I think if Mike was sitting here instead of you he'd be saying the same thing about himself,
not being a hero.
Maybe.
He was a good guy.
But I think that he would be ashamed of me, seeing me the way I am.
Think I could see my ma before they ship me off?
Think they'd do that?
See my ma?
I'm sorry, Ira.
We got stories now to tell our kids, I guess.
Keep your head down.
All aboard.
Good luck, Chief.
I think I saw him once after that.
It was maybe six or seven years after the war.
I was working as a salesman, doing a lot of driving.
I was driving west across Texas.
I was just trying to get where I was going so I could get home.
And I saw this guy hitchhiking on the side of the road.
And, for a second, I thought it might've been him.
I always regret that I didn't stop, but I was in a hurry.
And he was an Indian.
We always told the press that Ira insisted that he was going back to fight with his unit which was at least partially true, but
that isn't what got the headlines.
We're engaged.
Excuse me a minute, darling.
- Hey, Doc?
- Yeah?
- Got a minute?
- Yeah.
I'll see you at the car.
- You hear I'm getting married?
- I did, Rene.
That's great.
Yeah, it's something she wants.
She waited for me all this time.
She's not used to all this, but she's a good girl.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
So, I was wondering if you'd be my best man.
Me?
Don't you have somebody at home, a buddy, you'd rather ask?
Well, I didn't really make many.
The ones who didn't go, it's...
Well, it's hard to even talk to them.
You know?
Yeah, I know.
I'd be proud to.
Thank you.
I better go drag her away from them before she announces
I'm gonna be president of General Motors or something.
All right.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Rene, you're a lucky man.
- Big smile, Mrs. Gagnon!
- Say cheese!
I couldn't complain because the press loved them, so they wrote more articles and people bought more bonds.
The tour went on with just Rene and your dad.
And the true heroes are the men who didn't make it home from Iwo Jima, the men who died at Iwo Jima and in other campaigns.
We ask that you honor the memory of those men by buying the war bonds and helping us to win this war.
Thank you.
City after city, I thought the damn thing'd never end.
And this rumor kept going around that the photograph had been staged.
I remember your dad telling them that he wished he'd known he was having his picture taken because he would've ducked the hell out of it.
Whose idea was it?
Who wanted to stage the thing?
Come on, it was you?
Was there truth to the rumor that that picture was staged, Doc?
- Come on!
Doc?
- Can you answer that?
I remember when your dad got shot.
All hell was busting loose.
People back home saw that picture and thought it was over when we took Suribachi.
We wished.
Anyways, we're pinned down.
Mortars, shells, machine guns.
Fire coming from every which direction, right?
And we hear somebody call, "Corpsman down."
Corpsman down!
Blood was spurting out of his throat, and Doc was doing everything he could.
And the Corpsman looks up at him and he knows what this means, to be shot in the neck.
He knows he's dying, you can see that.
But still in his eyes, he's pleading with Doc to save his life.
And Doc can't.
- You okay, Doc?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah, you look fine.
- I'm okay.
Keep down, all right?
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.
Okay.
Corpsman.
Corpsman!
For God sake, Corpsman!
Corpsman?
Corpsman.
Incoming!
Let me see.
It's not that bad.
You're gonna be okay.
All right?
Just stay with me.
Look at me.
Took us a half-hour to find your dad.
He could've bled to death.
Coming down.
Thanks.
Vets'll tell you about being hit but not wanting to leave their buddies.
Usually, they're lying.
You'll take any excuse to get out of there.
But it happens.
You get the feeling you're letting them down.
I could see that in your dad's face.
He wanted to go, he'd seen enough.
But he didn't want to leave us.
Now, he was a hell of a good man, your dad.
Yeah.
While we were sitting there on the beach, we heard this great roar.
And we looked up.
That was the first of thousands of landings on Iwo.
- Look at that.
- Yeah.
How about that.
I'm gonna head back, all right?
Good luck.
That island saved a lot of lives.
A lot of lives.
I don't know what else to tell you.
After the bond tour my dad finally got his operation.
By the time he got home the war was over.
First thing he did was ask my mom to marry him.
Ira tried to get on with his life and put it all behind him.
Thank you for having me here today.
It's an honor to be in front of such a strong people.
Because of the war white men will understand Indians a lot better.
And it's going to be a better world.
But life had other plans for him.
You're...
You're him, aren't you?
You're the hero, right?
Great.
All right, kids, go get your picture taken.
Oh, that's great.
That's great.
All right, now say cheese.
Cheese!
That's great!
Okay.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Thanks.
- Come on.
- That's a hero, kids.
Hero, lift this basket, will you?
It's too heavy for me.
Rene tried to take advantage of those offers he'd received on the bond tour.
Yes.
G-A-G-N-O-N.
Right.
Pronounced Rene.
Rene, yes.
- Okay, I actually called last week.
- Yes.
Okay, yes.
Mr. Gagnon.
I gave Mr. Tennack your message.
I'm sure he'll call you.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
But he was yesterday's hero.
He even applied for a job at the local police station.
They said he wasn't qualified.
After working the factory with Pauline he tried a few things but spent the rest of his life as a janitor.
But Ira...
Ira!
You got a visitor.
Ira always made the news.
I could never find out why he did it, but one day Ira just took off.
He walked and hitched over 1,300 miles from Arizona to Texas.
He found Harlon Block's father working his field.
His wife, Belle, had left him soon after they discovered Harlon died.
She never forgave him for letting her son go off to war.
And Ira told him the truth, that it had been his son who raised the flag with them, his son in the photograph.
And then he just turned and walked away.
Though the flag-raising meant nothing to him, he somehow knew it would mean everything to them.
Thanks for calling.
Just as Belle knew all along.
The press soon found out and called Hank's mom with the news that it wasn't her son after all.
The last time they all saw each other was at the unveiling of the Marine Corps War Memorial.
And even though he planted the first flag above Iwo Jima,
Hank's mother and father weren't invited.
Ira.
It's good to see you, Ira.
Hell of a statue.
It wasn't long after that that they found Ira.
The papers said he died of exposure.
There was no autopsy.
It was about that same time when my father got in his car early one morning telling my mom he had something to do.
He drove to a town on the other side of Wisconsin where Iggy's mom lived.
Ever since she heard the news about her son she'd been trying to find out how he died, and no one would tell her.
I never found out what he told her, but I can pretty much guarantee it wasn't the truth.
My mother would ask him what was troubling him.
He would never say.
And every year, as it got close to Memorial Day, the reporters would start calling asking to interview my father.
No, I'm sorry.
He's fishing in Canada.
We were always instructed to say the same thing.
Okay.
Thanks.
When Mr. McCandless retired, my father bought the funeral home where he'd worked since coming home.
He spent the rest of his life running the business and raising his family.
He never spoke about the war or about the flag-raising, never told us anything.
The first time I heard any of these stories was after he died.
Where is he?
Oh, God.
He's not here, Dad.
He died.
Who?
Who died?
Iggy.
Iggy.
Christ, poor Iggy.
I hadn't thought of him for years.
How do you know about Iggy?
You were calling for him, when you collapsed.
I wasn't looking for Iggy.
I was looking for you.
I wanted to...
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry I wasn't a better father.
Talked to you more.
I just...
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
You were the best father a man could have.
Did I ever tell you they took us swimming?
No, Dad.
After we planted the flag, we came down off the mountain and they let us swim.
It was the funniest thing.
All this fighting and we were jumping around in the water like kids.
That's the way I remember Iggy now.
I finally came to the conclusion that maybe he was right.
Maybe there's no such thing as heroes.
Maybe there are just people like my dad.
I finally came to understand why they were so uncomfortable being called heroes.
Heroes are something we create, something we need.
It's a way for us to understand what is almost incomprehensible, how people could sacrifice so much for us.
But for my dad and these men, the risks they took, the wounds they suffered, they did that for their buddies.
They may have fought for their country, but they died for their friends.
For the man in front, for the man beside them.
And if we wish to truly honor these men, we should remember them the way they really were, the way my dad remembered them.
Come on, Doc!
Corpsman !
Corpsman !
Corpsman !
For God's sakes!
Corpsman !
Corpsman !
Corpsman !
What's wrong?
Every jackass thinks he knows what war is.
Especially those who have never been in one.
We like things nice and simple:
Good and evil, heroes and villains.
There's always plenty of both.
Most of the time, they are not who we think they are.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where, where is he?
Mr. Bradley?
Mr. B?
You okay?
-Where is he?
-Where is who?
Where is he?
Where did he go?
Where, where is he?
All right.
Just stay right here, okay?
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
It'll be okay.
Where is he?
Most guys I knew would never talk about what happened over there.
Probably because they're still trying to forget about it.
They certainly didn't think of themselves as heroes.
They died without glory.
Nobody has taken their pictures.
Only their buddies knew what they did.
I'd tell their folks they died for their country.
I'm not sure that was it.
Now, there were plenty other photos taken that day...
... butnoneanybodywantedtosee .
What we see and do in war...
... thecruelty,is unbelievable.
But somehow we gotta make some sense of it.
To do that, we need an easy-to-understand truth...
... anddamnfewwords.
Film's ruined.
I don't know.
This one looks all right.
And if you can get a picture....
Now, the right picture can win or lose a war.
You're gonna want to see this.
Look at Vietnam.
The picture of that South Vietnamese officer...
... blowingthatfella'sbrains out of the side of his head.
That was it.
The war was lost.
We just hung around trying to pretend it wasn't.
Took a lot of other pictures that day.
None of them made a difference.
Thanks.
Appreciate it.
Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.
Country was bankrupt.
People were becoming cynical and tired of war.
-Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon !
-Where?
Right there.
Planting that flag, that's your brother.
Ma, all you can see is his behind.
And that's his.
I powdered and diapered it, I know my son.
That's him.
Go get your father.
Daddy, Ma's got a picture of Harlon's keister in the paper.
You watch your mouth, young man.
Thank you.
One photo, almost all on its own, turned that around.
It's on the front page of every major paper.
Over 200 dailies and they're all flooded with requests for prints.
I think we might have found it.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman !
-I gotta go get him.
-Oh, no, you don't.
Iggy, I gotta go.
I have a whole different theory.
He wants medical attention, he'll come to us.
Hey, shut up and crawl over here, you lazy son of a bitch !
-As soon as that flare goes out.
-Crap.
-Okay, well, I'll go with you.
-No.
-You're gonna leave me here?
-I'll be right back, just--
Shoot some people.
I gotta go.
Oh, God.
Okay, it's okay.
Don't touch them.
Get your hands out, let me do that.
Don't look.
Keep your head back, your eyes on me.
Look at me.
I'll get it.
I'll take care of it.
We'll get this bandage on you.
We'll get you taken care of.
And we'll get you down to the bottom, all right?
You're gonna be fine.
It's okay.
I'll do that.
I'll do that.
Put some pressure on that.
Put your hands on top and put pressure on it.
Keep your head back.
Keep breathing.
Keep looking at me, all right?
Just keep looking at--
Doc.
Help me.
Help me.
How does that feel?
-It feels good.
-It does?
All right.
-Good.
-All right.
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.
I'll be right back.
I'm all right.
Go and help someone who's hurt.
All right.
Hold on there.
-Where did he go?
-Who?
-The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
-You jumped in the wrong hole.
I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
Shut up.
You want every Jap shooting at us?
Iggy!
Holy shit.
They expect us to climb this?
Or something just like it.
So where you think they're sending us?
I think it's the desert, Franklin.
Well, that makes no sense at all.
Well, it's just military psychology.
They always train you for the desert on a volcano.
Now you're just having fun with me.
Harlon, take your men right.
Watch for Bedouins.
-What's a Bedouin?
-It's a guy with a camel.
Well, jeez Louise, maybe we are going to the desert.
Now, you tilt that to the right, but what if the bullet comes from the left?
Bullets don't come from the left.
You know any left-handed Japs?
That makes as much sense as you showering with your shoes on.
You don't even know why you do it, do you?
Because I don't tell you mean I don't know?
You do it because Mike does it.
I'll ask him.
-So you cut hair back home?
-Some.
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?
No, I just studied it a little.
-But not in barber school?
-Nope.
Let me guess, Hayes is winning.
Chief, I had very little to do with Sitting Bull's death...
... somaybeyoucouldstop taking it out on me.
Different tribe.
The Pimas fought on the side of the white man.
-See, now that's smart.
-That is smart.
Yeah.
Worked real good for us.
Good luck, fellas.
Hey, good night, Lindberg.
Dead bodies.
He cuts hair on dead bodies.
Even I knew that.
-Who's in?
-Oh, I'm in.
It must be a lot easier with them not moving around and all.
There's that.
You know what I been thinking?
Well, they been telling us we need to buddy up...
... andI thinkwe 'dmake pretty good buddies.
And how do you figure that?
Well, you know, in that we have a lot in common.
So why do you cut dead people's hair, anyway?
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.
You tell a lot of people that?
You actually chose the Marines because they got the best uniform?
No sense being a hero if you don't look like one.
Jacks.
Queens.
Shit.
Do anything on that reservation but play cards, chief?
All right, listen up, you sorry bunch of leathernecks!
We going over the side tomorrow which means we ain't long for this rock.
-All right!
-About time.
Any man who doesn't have his masturbation papers in order...
... getthemsignedbytomorrow or he ain't going.
-I got mine already.
-Oh, yeah.
I'm square.
Wait.
Why am I just hearing about this?
I don't have to repeat everything twice for you.
No, I didn't hear nothing about no masturbating papers.
Heard they were running short.
You know, nobody tells me nothing.
That's real nice, guys.
All right, get over to the officer in charge of records.
Maybe he's got more.
-Leave your smokes.
I'll play for you.
-Thanks, Mike.
Listen, he calls you an idiot, you take it like a man, okay?
Just do not leave without signing them.
-I appreciate it, sergeant.
-You got it.
What the hell happened to your hair, Rene?
Look like a goddamn corpse.
Three points of contact on that rope at all times.
Next four.
Over the side.
Let's go.
Keep moving.
Next four, over the side.
Keep your eye on the guy below you.
That's all you gotta look at.
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.
Keep three points of contact on the rope at all times.
You see?
No big thing.
Just one step at a time and keep your hands on the vertical rope.
Once you're in the boat, move away.
Make sure you keep three points of contact on the rope.
-I got him !
-All right, get that man out of the water.
Give me a hand.
-Don't worry about him, Doc.
-All right, quit skylarking !
Keep moving.
He'll be fine.
Our target, Island X...
... isan ugly,smelly,dirtylittlescab of rock called Iwo Jima.
It means Sulfur Island, which accounts for the smell.
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop, you ask me.
After 20 straight days of bombing you won't find a blade of grass...
... ora twigon it .
It wasn'tthatpretty to start with.
Captain?
Iwo's just five and a half miles long, two and a half wide.
There's a lump down at the bottom.
That's Mount Suribachi.
On the maps in front of you the island is white.
Not much of it.
The black dots represent known enemy emplacements.
Coastal defense guns, dual-mount dual- purpose guns, covered artillery.
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns...
... machineguns,blockhouses,pillboxes, and earth-covered structures.
I don't see any barracks or any other structures.
That's right.
And we still don't know why.
Now, this isn't just any island to them.
This isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, or Saipan.
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders in eight square miles.
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.
It's up to us to convince them.
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.
The 8th Ammo Company will land here to resupply.
The Suribachi's guns are the problem.
They can hit any point on the island.
We're sitting ducks until we take them out.
That's our job.
We cut across the island at the base, slit its throat, lop off its head.
And we take that mountain.
We take that mountain, we take their big guns.
We take their eyes.
Okay, I'm heading in.
Follow me.
Let's put a good show on for the Marines.
Close it up.
Take it right down to the deck.
Yeah, boys!
Man overboard portside!
See him?
-Throw me a line!
-He's right there.
-Where is he?
-Watch out, watch out, watch out.
Hawaii's that way!
Just keep paddling, Mac, we'll catch you on the way back!
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!
They're not gonna stop.
What?
None of them are.
They can't.
So much for "no man left behind."
-Sir.
-Come on in.
Look, I've had to make a few other changes.
I'm promoting you...
... toplatoonsergeant.
-Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
-You bet.
Trouble is, I already told my men I'd see them through this.
That your James Cagney impersonation?
Because I've heard better.
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.
This isn't your first time.
You don't need to prove anything.
No, sir.
You're not the best sergeant, you're just the best one that's still walking.
-Block's a good man.
-Yes, sir, he is.
The men know him, he can step right in.
You know, I have actually thought this through.
Platoon sergeant puts you further away from the bullets.
I already gave them my word, sir.
I told them I'd bring them all home.
Which means I already lied to half of them.
Can't lie to the rest.
How are your men?
They'll do fine.
Except maybe Gagnon.
Our own Tyrone Power?
Yes, sir.
He's a good man, just...
... mightbe betteruse furtherback from the lines.
I'll use him as a runner.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
Now get out of here.
Hear the good news, Doc?
We're going in with the first waves.
Hey, you do that again I'll take your head off!
Fucking dominoes.
Iggy, have you ever heard news you considered to be bad?
The first ones off the ship, Doc.
We don't go over the side of the ship.
We hop on a tractor, they drive us right there.
Oh, shit, that is good news.
You see?
What did I tell you?
What's going on?
-I'm going up to take a look.
-Let's go.
Let's go topside.
Come on !
-I'll go with you.
-Come on, come on !
What the hell?
-Let's go, let's go!
-Right behind you.
Look at that.
We're killing them !
We're killing them, Doc.
I was promised 10 days of shelling.
You're giving me three and saying that's the best you can do?
I don't give a shit!
My men hit that beach with less than 10...
... andI 'llbetakingthemhome to their mamas in buckets!
Yeah, I know exactly why.
Because every Navy man with a scrambled egg on his chest...
... wantstooffloadushere and sail to Japan...
... sotheycanbethereforthebig finish.
Tell their kids they captured the emperor all by themselves.
Well, you aren't going to Japan unless we take this piece-of-shit island !
These little pricks are dug in !
Okay.
Appreciate that, Jim.
Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
I'm okay.
-Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
-Jesus, Iggy, leave me alone, all right?
How about you guys?
Knife?
Bayonet?
Kick in the ass?
How about you, Doc?
Sharpen your knife?
You sharpened it three times already.
Then I better make sure I didn't nick it.
Good man, Doc.
-Hey, Doc.
-Yeah.
When we land, try not to wave this kit around too much.
They got sharpshooters trained to look for them.
They know if they take out a corpsman...
... anotherdozenMarineswilldie unattended.
Okay, Mike.
Yeah, right there.
-Close the damn door.
For God's sake.
-Yeah, like that's gonna help.
That your girlfriend, chief?
Bet she's a pretty damn good-looking squaw.
Bet you're missing her, and that little wigwam of yours.
Welcome, all Marines off Iwo Jima.
We have a long-time wait--
It's what they do to prisoners...
... atleasttheluckyones .
Jesus.
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think about waving a white bandanna.
Poor Marines, so far from home for no good reason.
Think of your girls back home, waiting for you.
But a girl cannot stay home every night so who do you think they're with tonight?
And will she let him kiss her?
And will he comfort her at your funeral?
This sweet music is to make you think of your girls back home who are missing you.
This is all for now.
I'll see you tomorrow night.
We're clear!
Get up the berm !
Baker Company, move out!
-Seen Second Platoon?
-I don't see them.
-First squad, move out!
-God, this place reeks.
-Go, go, go!
-Move out!
Go, go, go!
Go, go!
Go!
Go, go!
Drop your packs!
Go!
All clear!
Jesus, you needed some exercise?
He got lost. 100 landing craft heading for one beach and this guy gets lost.
I'm glad we did.
Jesus, what a mess.
Any theories why they ain't shooting?
It's getting on my nerves.
Maybe they're all dead.
What do you think, Doc?
-You think they're all dead?
-Keep moving, Easy Company!
Let's go!
Mike, take six men and bring that gun onto the beach.
Second Platoon, let's move out!
Stay down.
Come on.
Move!
Move!
-Get down !
-Take cover!
Move out!
Go, go!
Get up on the beach !
Get up on the berm !
Go, go, go!
Cover fire!
Pour it on !
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!
Corpsman !
I'm gonna sling your arm and then I'll give you a shot for the pain.
Move, move!
Off the beach !
Take cover!
Dig in !
Dig in !
First Platoon !
Move, move!
You got a girl back home, Marine?
We're gonna make sure she sees you, all right?
Hey, I need pressure on this wound !
-See anything?
-Negative!
Pull that fire team up!
Where's the fire coming from?
Where are they?
Look for a flash, shoot at it!
Let's go, let's--
-Move it out!
-Move, move!
Let's go!
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!
You're over!
Third Squad, forward !
Move!
Where are they, sir?
We got ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock, pillbox!
Sergeant!
Sergeant.
I think I can clear that out.
All right, you go.
Here.
Take these.
Check your weapon.
Yeah?
Go!
Cover!
Cover him !
Cover, cover!
Son of a bitch.
-Let's go!
Go!
-Move it out!
Go, go, go!
Down, down, down !
-It's clear.
-Good work.
-I thought you said it was clear!
-It was!
Shit, I guess they're not in there firing at us then.
Lindberg !
Yeah !
Light it up!
-I'll cover you, Ice!
-Don't cover shit!
There's already enough people shooting.
One bullet and this thing goes up like a Roman candle.
Go!
Shift fire!
-Shift your fire!
-Go, go!
Shift your fire!
Go!
Go!
Hit the deck!
Stay down !
Wait for support!
Is this a bad battle or what?
-It's a fucking slaughter.
-Get down !
Corpsman !
Christ Jesus!
Get a machine gun team set up over here now!
Corpsman !
Corpsman !
Thank God !
Tanks!
Runner!
Get those tanks up here!
-Oh, shit.
-Man.
Get down !
Corporal, watch your left flank!
-Let's go without them !
-Let's go!
-Move out!
Move out!
-Let's go!
Let's go, move it.
Let's go!
Iggy, you gotta lift your side, he's gonna roll off.
Got it, Doc!
Incoming !
Corpsman !
-Move, move, move!
-Everybody off the LVT, now!
Give them cover fire!
Corpsman !
Keep moving !
Get that LVT up on the beach !
Keep moving !
You're next, pal, we're getting you out of here.
Move it!
Great news.
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa, because that's where we're headed.
Not you and me.
Captain Severance asked who else was in that picture.
Christ if I could remember...
... butit wasMikeandDocand Franklin and me and Hank Hansen...
... butIjustremembered, you were there too.
I wasn't there.
Of course you were.
Neither was Hank.
He raised the first flag.
Harlon Block raised that one.
Shit.
I told them it was Hank.
If you weren't there, how'd you know it was Harlon?
-You tell them it was me?
-No.
I just remembered.
Good, keep your mouth shut.
They know there was somebody else, by the picture.
-Pick someone dead.
-They don't want somebody dead...
... theywantto shipusback to the States.
What did I tell you?
-I wasn't there.
You hear?
-All right.
Just settle down.
-I'm not going anywhere.
-You're not going anywhere.
You wounded, son?
No, sir.
Did you take out a nest of Japs butt-naked with your bare hands?
Because if I'm gonna give up my seat...
... toa hero,he betterhave a good goddamn story to tell.
No, sir.
Then enjoy it, because they'll forget you before Christmas.
Sixth man, you got a name?
Sorry, still don't remember.
Damn shame, because I promised the major you'd know who it was.
Fact, you not knowing throws a doubt on you being one of the flag-raisers yourself.
Since no one wants to be embarrassed, the moment you land...
... they'llturnaround,shipyoutoOkinawa to meet your buddies on the beach.
So why don't you stop screwing with me?
Give me a damn name.
Gangway!
Gangway!
Let's go, let's go!
Gangway!
Where the hell is that son of a bitch?
Hayes!
Hayes!
Hayes, get your red ass over here!
Looks like I don't know...
... whatmymenare doingwith aflag the size of my mother's house?
Damn it, you shouldn't have lied to me.
Made me look like a complete asshole.
We're gonna miss you around here.
Good luck.
Now your name's in the paper too.
Just heard your doctor say we're postponing your operation.
You're being shipped back to the mainland.
Everybody who saw that picture thought planting the flag meant victory.
That's all they wanted to know.
Victory.
Within a few weeks of that picture being taken, half the men in it were dead.
Mrs. Hansen.
Mrs. Hansen.
Did you know Hank was a hero?
-Are you proud of him?
-What was he like as a boy?
-Look this way, please, ma'am.
-What do you have to say about your son?
But, somehow, being a part of it meant something.
Looking at it, you could believe their sacrifice was not a waste.
Yeah, I might have thought that was Harlon too.
It is.
Belle, their names are right here.
It's not him.
And he would be alive and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.
You think about that when you look at his picture, Ed.
And I need to rush home and change because there's the governor's banquet...
... andthenthere'sthe parade.
Imagine, the governor is coming here to meet us.
Now, I'm wearing blue so--
We interrupt this program to bring you a news bulletin from CBS World News.
A press association has just announced that President Roosevelt is dead.
The president died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
All we know so far is that the president died at Warm Springs in Georgia.
Further updates every hour.
Temperatures will remain the same today inthemid-30stolow-40s with clear skies.
Hello?
Yes.
Of course.
No, we understand.
It wouldn't be right.
Thank you.
Here he is, gentlemen.
Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.
Senator Haddigan, I'd like you to meet Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Damn good to meet you.
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.
Sorry?
That's Pima Indian talk, don't you know your own language?
Took forever to memorize the damn gibberish.
Sorry, I've been away from the reservation too long, senator.
-Doc.
-Ira.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
-That's you.
-Go, go, go.
Please welcome... .
Yeah.
Yeah.
Holy shit.
Come in, come in, come in.
Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.
-Rene Gagnon.
-Bud Gurber.
-Showing the boys the sights?
-Saw a hell of a ball game.
That's great.
The bar's there, help yourself.
I got some briefing sheets for you, some simple things we want you to say.
Mostly "Buy bonds." Can't say that too often.
Itineraries, those'll change every minute.
Everybody wants to meet you guys.
I got women sending up envelopes with stockings in them...
... noteswritteninlipstick.
We won't mention that to the press.
Have a drink, for chrissake.
My God, what you boys must've seen over there.
I've been watching the newsreels.
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.
So...
... wegotahellofalotofmoney to raise, not much time.
White House tomorrow, then you shake hands...
... witha fewhundredcongressmen who won't pull out a penny.
Politicians and actors.
Put them in a restaurant, they'd die before paying the check.
Then New York City, Times Square...
... dinnerswithvarioushoi polloi, then Chicago.
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?
That's what we're calling the mothers of the dead flag-raisers.
You present each mother with a flag, they say a few words...
... peoplewillshitmoney.
It'll be so moving.
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.
Lovely woman.
She knows how close you and her son were.
He wrote home about you.
She is very much looking forward to meeting you.
Hank wasn't in the picture.
Sorry?
Hank didn't raise that flag.
He raised the other one, the real flag.
The what?
The real flag?
There's a real flag?
Ours was the replacement flag.
We put it up when they took the other one down.
Am I the only one getting a headache here?
You know about this?
It was after it was already in the papers.
The mothers had already been told, Bud.
That's beautiful.
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Why tell me?
I'm only the guy that has to explain it to 150 million Americans.
Who's in the goddamn picture?
Are any of you guys in the goddamn picture?
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.
Six guys raising a flag over Iwo Jima.
Victory is ours.
-You're three of them?
-This was the fifth day.
The battle went on for 35 more.
What'd you do, raise a damn flag every time you stopped for lunch?
Can I hit this guy?
I don't give a shit, you raised the flag, that's the story we're selling, boys.
Are you deaf?
Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?
Harlon Block.
That's whose mother should be here if anyone's should be.
You know, I think this whole damn thing is a farce, if you ask me.
You know what they're calling this bond drive?
The Mighty Seventh.
They might've called it the "We're Flat Broke so We're Begging for Pennies"...
... bonddrive,but itdidn 'thave the ring.
They could've called it that...
... becausethelastbond drivescame so short we printed money instead.
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street...
... ourdollaris nexttoworthless, we borrowed so much.
And nobody is lending any more.
Ships aren't being built.
Tanks aren't being built.
Machine guns, bazookas, hand grenades, zip.
You think this is a farce?
You want to go back to your buddies?
Stuff some rocks in your pockets...
... becausethat'sall wegot to throw at the Japanese.
And don't be surprised if your plane doesn't make it...
... becausethefueldumpsareempty.
And our good friends the Arabs are only taking bullion.
If we don't raise 14 billion dollars-- And that's million with a "B."
--this war is over by the end of the month.
We give the Japanese whatever they want and we come home.
You've seen them fight, and they sure as shit ain't giving up.
Fourteen billion.
The last three drives didn't make that much altogether.
People on the street corners, they looked at this picture and they took hope.
Don't ask me why, I think it's crappy, myself.
You can't even see your faces.
But it said, "We can win this war, are winning this war...
... wejustneedyou to dig a little deeper."
They wanna give us that money.
No, they want to give it to you.
But you don't want to ask for it, give them hope.
You want to explain about this person and that flag.
Well, that's your choice.
Because if we admit we made a mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about...
... andthatwillbethat .
Gentlemen.
Mr. President, here they are.
-Well, hello.
Good to see you.
-Mr.
President.
Darn good to see you, boys.
Heard you had a hell of a fight on your hands out there, hell of a fight.
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation in Arizona, am I right?
Yes, Mr. President.
Being an Indian, you are a truer American than any of us.
Bet your people are proud you're in that uniform.
Very proud, sir.
They should be.
Thank you for coming all this way...
... toWashingtonto helpusout.
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific...
... nowwe needyou tofight for a mountain of cash.
-I don't expect you'll let us down.
-No, sir.
-No, sir.
-Good.
Then go get it.
That's the end of this ceremony.
Let's take a look at this famous photo over here, see if I can pick you out.
My gosh.
There you are.
Boys.
Boys, this one's on me.
-To those who can't be with us.
-Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon.
May we have your autograph?
I suppose.
And your name is?
I get the impression I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.
You're such a hero.
I feel honored to be in your presence.
That's just not true.
That's professional work.
Here, to professionals.
Here they are.
You're the guys in the photograph, right?
I heard you were on the train.
Let me shake your hands.
John Tennack.
John Bradley.
These boys, Harvard and Yale types, didn't fight.
Pappies all rich sons of bitches.
Boys, shake hands with some real war heroes.
Excuse me for one moment.
Buy them a drink while you're at it.
Drinks for these men all the way around.
And you're the other one, John Tennack, Tennack Homes.
-Rene Gagnon.
-Pleased to meet you.
Have a drink.
And here's my card.
Listen to me, Rene.
When you get finished being famous, you come see me...
... becauseif youcan sellbonds, you can sell homes.
Now, they're not gonna build homes anymore, they're gonna deliver them.
-Heard of prefab homes?
-No, sir.
You will.
And you hang on to that card and you come see me, you hear?
-All right?
-Certainly will.
All right.
It's all right.
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?
If Mike and the guys could see us.
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it, would they?
Harlon !
Franklin !
Can you imagine Franklin...
... onthistrain...
... eatingatthediningcar with all the silver?
We shouldn't be here, Doc.
Ira!
Hey, Ira.
We heard the picture was posed.
-What?
-We heard you posed the picture!
Hey, Doc.
We're bigger than life, Doc.
-Hey, good job.
-Thank you.
Thank you, girls.
And now...
... herearethe men you've been waiting to meet...
... themenin white.
Right behind me, here, the heroes of Iwo Jima:
Private First Class Rene Gagnon...
... PrivateFirstClassIraHayes ...
... andNavyCorpsman John "Doc" Bradley!
Thank you.
It's good of you to come out tonight in support of the war effort.
We really need you to buy bonds, that's for sure.
Because we can't win the war without your help.
As far as us being the heroes of Iwo Jima...
... that'sjustnotthe case.
We really didn't do much at all.
Especially him.
Especially me.
I was just a runner.
That's it.
We put up a flag.
The pole we attached it to was heavy, so it took a number of us.
We had our picture taken doing it.
The real heroes are dead on that island.
We'd appreciate it if you bought bonds in honor of them.
Thank you.
Jump on any grenades, Ira?
Take out any machine gun nests I missed?
-At least I fired my weapon.
-All right, knock it off.
You hit anything or were you too drunk then too?
Hey, hey, hey.
Guys!
Come on.
Stop it.
Knock it off.
Sit between these two boys.
--for us and they need our help.
And if you think about it, I think you'll realize...
... thatbuyingmorebonds is not just the right thing to do...
... buttheonlythingtodo.
Yes, this war has gone on too long.
We have given too many lives.
And its cost--
-Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
-Strawberry.
--has been far too high.
But if we waver now...
... ifwe don'tdig deep and give more than we think we can...
... thenthosesacrifices would be wasted...
-Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
-... andthoseliveslostinvain.
Move!
Go, go!
Corpsman !
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over.
Where the hell are our tanks?
Stuck in the sand.
Captain says go without them.
Christ.
Real good work you're doing there, Rene.
Prepare to move out.
Pass the word.
-Prepare to move out!
-Second Platoon !
-Move!
Move!
-All right, Second Platoon, on your feet!
-Let's move out!
-Jackass.
-Let's move out!
-Go, go, go!
Move, go, go, move, move!
Corpsman !
Doc!
Doc, get out of there!
Corpsman !
Doc!
Doc, get the hell out of there!
May I have your attention, please?
Train number 48, with service from New York City Boston, Rochester, New York Toledo, Ohio, South Bend, Indiana is now arriving on Track 7.
Train number 48, now arriving on Track number 7.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.
-Come on, let's go.
-Boys.
-Watch your step, now.
-Thank you very much.
-Here you go.
-Thank you.
-Watch your step.
-Let me help you, ma'am.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the heroes of Iwo Jima.
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.
-Private First Class Ira Hayes.
-Excuse me, let me through, please.
And Private First Class Rene Gagnon.
Rene!
That's my boyfriend !
-Who the hell is that?
-I don't know.
-Rene, is that your girl?
-Hey, what do they call you?
Hey, look at that!
What's your name, doll?
What's your name?
Hey, she's a beauty.
Let's go find a saloon.
Smile, boys.
Give them their money's worth.
Hey, Doc, how's the tour going for you?
Where exactly are you staying?
-Oh, I'm not sure yet.
-Just forget about that.
-Who's the dreamboat?
-Hey, Rene, a big smile.
Come on, one more shot.
Senator, I'd like you to meet Corpsman John Bradley.
-Doc, right?
-Yes, sir.
Good to meet you.
Now, we appreciate everything you've done...
-... andeverythingyou'redoing.
-Thank you, sir.
This is Captain White.
-Colonel Johns.
-We're proud of you, corpsman.
And then Colonel McCourtney.
-Major General Green.
-Nice to meet you.
Senator, this is Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Of course.
Now, I hear you used a tomahawk on those Japs, is that true, chief?
No, sir.
Well, tell them you did.
Makes a better story, huh?
-Attaboy.
-This is Captain Green.
John?
Madeline Evelley.
I recognize you from all the photographs.
I'm Hank's mom.
It's so nice to meet you, ma'am.
Hank was always talking about you.
-This is PFC Rene Gagnon.
-Pleasure to meet you, son.
-Thank you, sir.
-Thanks for everything.
-My pleasure.
-Not at all.
Ira, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Strank, Mike's mom.
It's all right.
When I got the telegram, I... .
I don't know what I'm trying to say here.
Knowing he was with you that day and seeing him in that photograph...
... I don'tknowwhy itmakesme feel better, but it does.
-It's so silly, isn't it?
-No, it's not.
How are you, son?
Thank you very much.
We're the largest furniture wholesaler in Illinois.
-Thank you.
Excuse me.
-I'll make sure he calls.
-Well, thank you.
Thank you.
-Thank you.
Are you Rene?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Franklin's mother.
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.
I'm Pauline, Rene's girlfriend.
Would you mind?
Paper said that's Hank...
... andI honestlycan'ttell.
It's horrible of a mother not to know her own son, isn't it?
But that's him, isn't it?
Well, to be honest, ma'am, it happened so quick...
... andwitheverythingthatwasgoing on it's hard to remember who was where.
But...
... yeah,I thinkthat'swherehewas.
That's Hank.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Excuse us.
Take him outside.
I'm Pauline.
Nice to meet you.
He was the best Marine I ever knew.
Thank you.
-You okay, chief?
-Christ.
-I'm okay.
-Yeah, you look it.
You're gonna screw this up, aren't you?
You're gonna screw it up for all of us.
I've got him.
Get some sleep, Ira.
-Mike?
-Yeah?
-Do you see this?
-What?
-Mike?
-Oh, shit, go!
He's killing me!
Hey, Doc, you think they got them all?
-What?
-Well, they're not shooting at us.
Maybe we killed them all or they ran off in the night.
Or they're waiting for us to start climbing.
Third Platoon !
Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.
-Just us?
-Yeah, just us, Igg.
All right, Third Platoon, move!
I tag along?
You can lead the way, if you want.
Get a good shot of my face.
It's your ass I'm gonna make famous, Hank.
Hey, that'll work for me too.
Lieutenant, if you make it to the top, put this up.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, Iggy.
They never shoot at the first patrol.
-They don't?
-No.
They want us to go up, signal that it's okay...
... thenshooteverybodyelse as they come up the mountain.
-Really?
-Yeah.
Unless, of course, they want to make an example of us and discourage the others.
I think you're full of crap, you know that, Hank?
Really?
Jesus.
Thank God that ain't us.
Told you.
Boots, spread them out and put them on a line.
Set up a perimeter!
First Squad !
-Hank?
Find me a pole.
-Yeah.
Right here.
Let's put this flag up.
Watch it.
Right over here.
Here, here.
That's good.
Right here, right here.
Got that end?
Hold that steady.
Lindberg.
-Hey, who's got rope?
-Right here.
-Give me something-
- Yeah, good.
-That work?
Do it, fellas.
Keep it coming.
USMC!
USMC!
-Shit, look!
-Look at that!
Yeah !
Yeah !
Yeah !
Jeez, look at that.
Get down !
Take cover!
Cover with that .30!
-Watch it!
Twenty yards down, Hank!
-You see them?
-I got about 20 yards, left side.
-Lindberg, get the flamethrower!
Boots, you see them?
Cover right!
-About 20 yards down !
Duck one!
-You see them?
Keep the cover on !
Second Squad, you see them?
Get me some grenades!
I see them !
-You see them?
-Right flank, over to the right!
Cover me, I'm going down !
Careful, Iggy.
Easy.
All clear!
Okay, guys, who wants to be famous?
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
-Goddamn it.
Strank!
-Sir?
They want a phone line run up to the top of the mountain.
Let me guess, they picked us.
Second Platoon, let's go.
Get some exercise.
Let's go.
Get off your ass.
Oh, shit!
Hope it still works, because you're not getting mine.
-Get Forrestal !
-All right.
I don't know whose idea it was, Mr. Secretary.
Well, it was goddamned brilliant.
I want that flag, Holland.
Mark my words...
... raisingthatson ofa bitchmeans a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.
I want that flag.
Yes, sir.
I'll make sure no one touches it.
You can count on me.
Fuck that.
That flag belongs to the men in this battalion.
That son of a bitch thinks our men died taking this ground...
... sowecouldhandourflag to some politician to pin to his wall?
He's out of his goddamn mind !
Get me that flag and find another one to replace it.
You've gotta be shitting me.
Gagnon !
Get your ass over here.
-Hey.
-Hey.
-Hey, fellas.
-How you doing?
Missed a beautiful shot, Joe.
It's that kind of day.
-Hey, Mike.
-Hell of a view, lieutenant.
Lieutenant!
Captain says he wants that flag.
-He wants this flag?
-Yes, sir.
-We just put the damn thing up.
-Yes, sir.
Some kind of flag shortage?
He wants you to put this one up instead.
Hey, Mike.
-Do me a favor.
Put this up, will you?
-Yes, sir.
All right, let's find a pole.
Take the flag down, boys.
Captain's orders.
You heard him, let's do it.
-There you go.
-Lordy, she's a heavy one.
All right, hang on.
Put this on.
One hell of a view.
Good view from up here.
Yes, I'd say so myself.
All right.
-Not in your way here, am I, Joe?
-No, I'm fine, thanks.
Hey, Doc, you wanna give us a hand here?
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.
Ready?
Ready?
Let's go.
Did you get it?
I don't know.
I wish I could've seen their faces.
Nobody even noticed that second flag going up.
Everybody saw that damn picture and made up their own story about it.
But your dad and the others knew what they had done and what they had not.
All your friends dying...
... it'shardenoughtobe calledahero for saving somebody's life.
But for putting up a pole?
You gotta be kidding.
Hey!
It took a lot of talented folks a long time to make that thing.
Wait till tonight, when it's lit properly, there's thousands of cheering people.
It's gonna look a lot better.
So stadium lights come down, spotlight comes up, you get your cue.
Charge up this thing with the flag, plant it at the top.
You smile, you wave.
You know the drill.
You want us to plant the flag on a pile of papier-mâché.
Hey, that's show biz.
And try and stand how you stood the first time you planted it.
You know, pretend the other three guys are with you.
The dead guys.
Yeah, yeah.
-Okay, not a problem.
-Good.
But where do we imagine Hank is standing?
Sorry?
Seeing that he wasn't there, it'll be kind of hard for us to leave a space for him.
I think you know exactly where he was.
You pointed him out to his mother.
This is bullshit.
I planted that damn thing once and I'm not doing it again.
-Hayes.
-For chrissake.
Hayes.
Hayes, get your ass back here or you're going on report.
Hayes!
You wanna do your damn job?
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Come on !
Come on !
He's with me!
Hey, he's with me!
-Back off!
-Sir, he's with me, okay?
He's with me.
Ira, put the goddamn chair down !
-Put the chair down, son !
-Put the chair down, Ira!
Tell them drop their sticks!
They're cops.
They're supposed to have nightsticks.
You're not supposed to be swinging a chair.
-Calm down, son.
-Sir, turn around, please.
That poster right there?
The one on the end, that's him.
-That's him?
-Yes, sir.
Do you read the papers?
Oh, Christ.
We got another fucking hero.
Get him out of here.
-Can you do that?
-Yes, sir.
Put the goddamn chair down.
And let's go.
Did you start this?
He didn't serve me!
I don't make the rules.
We don't serve Indians.
He needs to go sleep it off.
Soldier Field.
You hear that?
What the hell is that?
I can't figure it out.
Keep an eye out.
Hey, it sounds like it's coming from up there.
They're using grenades.
They're killing themselves.
Ira, let's go.
Come on.
Let's go, Ira.
Come on.
Thank God.
Jesus.
Look at you, chief.
You found him.
Holy shit.
You would have to pick today.
Vandegrift is here with enough brass to start a fucking band.
-Come on, let's go.
Can you walk?
-Yes, sir.
By yourself?
All right, look.
I don't care if you have to carry him.
Get him to the top, plant that flag, and don't fucking fall off.
Get him in his stuff.
I'll stall these guys for as long as I can.
Hurry up.
Jesus Christ.
And now the heroes of Iwo Jima!

Left flank!
Left flank!
Franklin, Gus, go check it out!
Hustle up, boys!
-We got them !
-Clear!
One hell of an experience.
Move out!
Cease fire!
They're my men !
You're targeting our men !
You're targeting our--
Get me another radio!
Sergeant?
Sergeant!
Mike!
Mike, Mike, Mike!
Mike?
Mike!
Here.
Hey, where's Doc?
Corpsman !
Oh, shit.
How's his breathing?
Harlon, move, buddy.
Hey, Mike.
Mike, Mike, can you hear us?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on, Mike.
Mike?
Mike, can you hear us?
Oh, Jesus.
All right, let's go!
Move out!
We need a hand over here.
I'm gonna get a stretcher.
Let's take him down, move him off the beach.
Ladies and gentlemen, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Corpsman!
Hank!
Hank!
Doc, they killed me.
Harlon !
Doc...
... theykilledme .
Come on, Harlon.
Harlon, stay with me.
Franklin !
-Franklin.
-I'm fine, Ira.
Corpsman!
-Where'd he go?
-Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
-I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
-I didn't.
He was right here.
Now, where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
Shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Does it open?
Iggy!
Iggy!
Iggy, are you down there?
Iggy!
Can't tell who it is, but he's one of ours.
I had to go outside to throw up.
Look what they did to the poor son of a bitch.
You okay, chief?
Just let it go.
If that doesn't pry open their wallets, nothing will.
Jesus Christ, he's drunk.
Goddamn Indians.
Come on, chief.
Let's get you home.
That's not what I hear.
I called around, I'm not stupid.
He's been drunk since he started this damn tour, making a spectacle of himself.
Just about choked that poor woman at the reception, blubbering.
Jesus Christ, you're supposed to be watching these men.
-Yes, sir.
-He's making us look like regular asses.
With all due respect, he never wanted to come on this trip.
Had to pull him, kicking, screaming, off that boat.
He wants to be with his unit.
What unit?
They're all fucking dead.
This is how he honors those men, by drinking and throwing up and... ?
You know what?
He wants it?
Great, we'll send him back.
Get him packed and on a train today.
He's an embarrassment to the uniform.
Yes, sir.
I'll do it.
Yeah, no, that's, that's good.
That's what I want.
I know it's a good thing...
... raisingthemoneyandthat, because we need it.
But I can't take them calling me a hero.
All I did was try not to get shot.
Some of the things I saw done, things I did...
... theyweren'tthingstobeproud of, you know?
Mike.
Mike was a hero.
You ever meet him?
No.
Best Marine I ever met.
You know, chief, I think if Mike was sitting here instead of you...
... he'dbe sayingthe samething about himself...
... notbeingahero .
Maybe.
He was a good guy.
But I think that he would be ashamed of me...
... seeingmetheway Iam .
Think I could see my ma before they ship me off?
Think they'd do that?
See my ma?
I'm sorry, Ira.
We got stories now to tell our kids, I guess.
Keep your head down.
All aboard.
Good luck, chief.
Think I saw him once after that.
It was maybe six or seven years after the war.
I was working as a salesman, doing a lot of driving.
I was driving west across Texas.
I was trying to get where I was going so I could get home.
And I saw this guy hitchhiking on the side of the road.
And for a second, I thought it might've been him.
I'll always regret that I didn't stop, but I was in a hurry.
And he was an Indian.
We always told the press Ira insisted that he was going back to fight with his unit...
... whichwasat leastpartiallytrue ...
... butthatisn 'twhatgottheheadlines.
We're engaged.
Excuse me a minute, darling.
-Hey, Doc?
-Yeah?
Got a minute?
-Yeah.
-I'll see you at the car.
-You hear I'm getting married?
-I did, Rene.
That's great.
Yeah, it's something she wants.
She waited for me all this time.
She's not used to all this, but she's a good girl.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
So I was wondering if you'd be my best man.
Me?
Don't you have somebody at home, a buddy you'd rather ask?
Well, I didn't really make many.
The ones who didn't go, it's, well, it's hard to even talk to them.
-You know.
-Yeah, I know.
I'd be proud to.
Thank you.
I better go drag her away from them...
... beforesheannouncesI'mgonna be president of General Motors or something.
All right.
-Congratulations, honey.
-Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Rene, you're a lucky man.
-Here they are now.
-Here they come.
Grab a shot of them on the steps.
-Big smile, Mrs. Gagnon !
-Say cheese.
I couldn't complain, because the press loved them so they wrote more articles and people bought more bonds.
The tour went on with just Rene and your dad.
And the true heroes are the men...
... whodidn'tmakeithome from Iwo Jima...
... themenwhodiedatIwoJima and in other campaigns.
We ask that you honor the memory of those men...
... bybuyingthe war bonds and helping us to win this war.
Thank you.
City after city, I thought the damn thing would never end.
And this rumor kept going around that the photograph had been staged.
Your dad said he wished he'd known he was having his picture taken becausehewould'veducked the hell out of it.
Was this your idea?
Whose idea was it?
Who wanted to stage the thing?
Was there truth to the rumor that that picture was staged, Doc?
-Come on !
Doc?
-Can you answer that?
I remember when your dad got shot.
All hell was busting loose.
People back home saw that picture...
... andthoughtit wasover when we took Suribachi.
We wished.
Anyways, we're pinned down.
Mortars, shells, machine guns.
Fire coming from every which direction, right?
And we hear somebody call, "Corpsman down."
Corpsman down !
Blood was spurting out of his throat and Doc was doing everything he could.
And the corpsman looks up at him and he knows what this means, shot in the neck.
He knows he's dying, you can see that.
But still, in his eyes he's pleading with Doc to save his life.
And Doc can't.
-You okay, Doc?
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-Yeah, you look fine.
-I'm okay.
Keep down, all right?
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.
Okay.
Corpsman.
Corpsman !
For God's sake, corpsman.
Corpsman?
Corpsman.
Incoming !
Let me see.
It's not that bad, you're gonna be okay.
All right?
Just stay with me.
Look at me.
Took us a half-hour to find your dad.
He could've bled to death.
Coming down.
We got a chest wound.
Put pressure on it.
Thanks.
Vets will tell you about being hit but not wanting to leave their buddies.
Usually, they're lying.
You'll take any excuse to get out of there.
But it happens.
You get the feeling you're letting them down.
I could see that in your dad's face.
Oh, he wanted to go.
He'd seen enough.
But he didn't want to leave us.
Now, he was a hell of a good man, your dad.
Yeah.
While we were sitting there on the beach...
...we heard this great roar.
And we looked up....
That was the first of thousands of landings on Iwo.
-Look at that.
-Yeah.
How about that.
I'm gonna head back, all right?
Good luck.
That island saved a lot of lives.
A lot of lives.
I don't know what else to tell you.
After the bond tour, my dad finally got his operation.
By the time he got home, the war was over.
First thing he did was ask my mom to marry him.
Ira tried to get on with his life and put it all behind him.
Like to thank you for having me here today.
It's an honor to be in front of such a strong people.
Because of the war...
... whitemenwillunderstandIndians a lot better.
And it's going to be a better world.
But life had other plans for him.
You're-
- You're him, aren't you?
You're the hero, right?
Great.
All right, kids, go get your picture taken.
Oh, that's great.
That's great.
All right, now say cheese.
-Cheese.
-Cheese.
That's great.
Okay.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Thanks.
-Come on.
-That's a hero, kids.
Hey, hero, lift this basket, will you?
It's too heavy for me.
Rene tried to take advantage of those offers he'd received on the bond tour.
Yes, G-A-G-N-O-N.
Right.
Pronounced "Rene."
Rene, yes.
I actually called last week.
Yes.
Okay, yes.
Mr. Gagnon.
I gave Mr. Tennack your message.
I'm sure he'll call you.
Okay.
All right...
... thankyou.
But he was yesterday's hero.
He even applied for a job at the local police station.
They said he wasn't qualified.
After working the factory with Pauline he tried a few things but spent the rest of his life as a janitor.
But Ira... .
Ira.
You got a visitor.
Ira always made the news.
I could never find out why he did it, but one day Ira just took off.
He walked and hitched over 1300 miles...
... fromArizonato Texas.
He found Harlon Block's father working his field.
His wife, Belle, had left him soon after they discovered Harlon died.
She never forgave him for letting her son go off to war.
And Ira told him the truth.
That it had been his son who raised the flag with them his son in the photograph.
And then he just turned and walked away.
Though the flag-raising meant nothing to him hesomehowknew it would mean everything to them.
Thanks for calling.
Just as Belle knew all along.
The press soon found out andcalledHank'smom withthenews that it wasn't her son after all.
The last time they all saw each other was at the unveiling of the Marine Corps War Memorial.
And even though he'd planted the first flag above lwo Jima Hank'smotherandfather weren't invited.
Ira.
It's good to see you, Ira.
Hell of a statue.
It wasn't long after that that they found Ira.
The papers said he died of exposure.
There was no autopsy.
It was about that same time my father got in his car early one morning telling my mom he had something to do.
He drove to a town on the other side of Wisconsin, where Iggy's mom lived.
Ever since she heard the news about her son...
...she'd been trying to find out how he died, and no one would tell her.
I never found out what he told her...
...but I can pretty much guarantee it wasn't the truth.
My mother would ask him what was troubling him.
He would never say.
And every year, as it got close to Memorial Day the reporters would start calling, asking to interview my father.
No, I'm sorry, he's fishing in Canada.
We were always instructed to say the same thing.
Okay.
Thanks.
When Mr. McCandless retired my father bought the funeral home where he'd worked since coming home.
He spent the rest of his life running the business and raising his family.
He never spoke about the war or about the flag-raising.
Never told us anything.
The first time I heard any of these stories was after he died.
Where is he?
Oh, God.
He's not here, Dad.
He died.
Who?
Who died?
Iggy.
Iggy.
Christ, poor Iggy.
I hadn't thought of him for years.
How do you know about Iggy?
You were calling for him.
When you collapsed.
I wasn't looking for Iggy.
I was looking for you.
I wanted to... .
I wanted to tell you, I'm-- I'm sorry I wasn't a better father.
Talked to you more.
I just... .
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
You were the best father a man could have.
Did I ever tell you they took us swimming?
No, Dad.
After we planted the flag, we came down off the mountain...
... andtheyletusswim .
It was the funniest thing.
All this fighting and--
And we were jumping around in the water like kids.
That's the way I remember Iggy now.
I finally came to the conclusion that maybe he was right.
Maybe there's no such thing as heroes.
Maybe there are just people like my dad.
I finally came to understand why they were so uncomfortable...
...being called heroes.
Heroes are something we create, something we need.
It's a way for us to understand what is almost incomprehensible how people could sacrifice so much for us.
But for my dad and these men...
...the risks they took, the wounds they suffered they did that for their buddies.
They may have fought for their country, but they died for their friends.
For the man in front, for the man beside them.
And if we wish to truly honor these men...
... weshouldrememberthem the way they really were the way my dad remembered them.
Come on, Doc!
remember them the way they really were the way my dad remembered them.
Come on, Doc!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
For God sakes!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Honey, what's wrong?
Every jackass thinks he knows what war is.
Especially those who've never been in one.
We like things nice and simple, good and evil, heroes and villains.
There's always plenty of both.
Most of the time, they are not who we think they are.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where...
Where is he?
Where is he?
Mr. Bradley?
Mr. B?
You okay?
- Where is he?
- Where is who?
Where is he?
Where did he go?
Where...
Where is he?
All right.
Just stay right here, okay?
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
It'll be okay.
Where is he?
Most guys I knew would never talk about what happened over there.
Probably 'cause they're still trying to forget about it.
They certainly didn't think of themselves as heroes.
They died without glory.
Nobody has taken their pictures.
Only their buddies knew what they did.
I'd tell their folks they died for their country.
I'm not sure that was it.
Now, there were plenty other photos taken that day, but none anybody wanted to see.
What we see and do in war, the cruelty, is unbelievable.
But somehow we gotta make some sense of it.
To do that, we need a easy to understand truth and damn few words.
Film's ruined.
I don't know.
This one looks all right.
And if you can get a picture...
Now, the right picture can win or lose a war.
You're gonna want to see this.
Look at Vietnam.
The picture of that South Vietnamese officer blowing that fella's brains out of the side of his head, whammo!
That was it.
The war was lost.
We just hung around trying to pretend it wasn't.
Took a lot of other pictures that day.
None of them made a difference.
Thanks.
Appreciate it.
Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.
Country was bankrupt.
People were becoming cynical and tired of war.
Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon!
Where?
Right there.
Planting that flag, that's your brother.
Ma, all you can see is his behind.
And that's his.
I powdered and diapered it, I know my son.
That's him.
Go get your father.
Daddy, Ma's got a picture of Harlon's keister in the paper.
You watch your mouth, young man.
Thank you.
One photo, almost all on its own, turned that around.
It's on the front page of every major paper.
Over 200 dailies and they're all flooded with requests for prints.
I think we might have found it.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- I gotta go get him.
- Oh, no, you don't.
Iggy, I gotta go.
I have a whole different theory.
He wants medical attention bad enough, he'll come to us.
Shut up and crawl over here, you lazy son-of-a-bitch!
As soon as that flare goes out.
- Crap.
Okay, well, I'll go with you.
- No.
You're actually gonna leave me here?
I'll be right back, just shoot some people.
I gotta go.
Oh, God.
Okay, it's okay.
Don't touch them.
Don't touch them.
Get your hands out of there.
Let me do that.
I'll do it, okay?
Don't look.
Keep your head back.
Keep your eyes on me.
All right, look at me.
I'll get it.
I'll take care of it.
We'll get this bandage on you.
We'll get you taken care of.
And we'll get you down to the bottom, all right?
Look, you're gonna be fine.
It's okay.
I'll do that.
I'll do that.
Here, put some pressure on that.
Put your hands on top and put some pressure on it.
Keep your head back.
Keep breathing.
Keep looking at me, all right?
Just keep looking at...
Doc.
Help me.
Help me.
All right.
Okay.
How's that feel?
- It feels good.
- It does?
All right.
- Good.
- All right.
I'm gonna go get a stretcher and get you down to the beach.
I'll be right back.
I'm all right.
Go and help someone who's hurt.
All right.
Hold on there.
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Lggy!
Lggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Lggy!
Holy shit.
They expect us to climb this?
Or something just like it.
So, where you think they're sending us?
I think it's the desert, Franklin.
Well, that makes no sense at all.
Well, it's just military psychology.
They always train you for the desert on a volcano.
Now you're just having fun with me.
Harlon, take your men right.
- Watch for Bedouins.
- Yes, sir.
- What's a Bedouin?
- It's a guy with a camel.
Well, Jeez Louise, maybe we are going to the desert.
Now, you tilt that to the right, but what if the bullet comes from the left?
Bullets don't come from the left.
You know any left-handed Japs?
That makes about as much sense as you showering with your shoes on.
You don't even know why you do it, do you?
'Cause I don't tell you mean I don't know?
You do it 'cause Mike does it.
I'll ask him.
So you cut hair back home?
Some.
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?
No, I just studied it a little.
But not in barber school?
Nope.
- Gosh.
- Let me guess, Hayes is winning.
Chief, I had very little to do with Sitting Bull's death, so maybe you could stop taking it out on me.
Different tribe.
The Pimas fought on the side of the white man.
- See, now that's smart.
- That is smart.
Yeah.
Worked real good for us.
Good luck, fellas.
Hey, good night, Lindberg.
Dead bodies.
He cuts hair on dead bodies.
What?
Even I knew that.
- Who's in?
- Oh, I'm in.
I'm in.
It must be a lot easier with them not moving around and all.
- There's that.
- Yeah.
You know what I been thinking?
Well, they been telling us we need to buddy up and I think we'd make pretty good buddies.
And how do you figure that?
Well, you know, in that we have a lot in common.
So, why do you cut dead people's hair, anyway?
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.
You tell a lot of people that?
You actually chose the Marines because they got the best uniform?
No sense being a hero if you don't look like one.
Jacks.
Queens.
Shit.
Do anything on that reservation but play cards, Chief?
All right, listen up, you sorry bunch of leathernecks!
We practice going over the side tomorrow which means we ain't long for this piece of rock.
All right!
One more thing, any man who doesn't have his masturbation papers in order better get them signed by tomorrow night or he ain't going overseas.
- I got mine already.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm square.
Wait.
Why am I just hearing about this?
That's horseshit, Franklin.
I don't have to repeat everything twice for you.
No, I didn't hear nothing about no masturbating papers.
Heard they were running short.
You know, nobody tells me nothing.
That's real nice, guys.
All right, get your ass over to the officer in charge of records.
Maybe he got some more left.
- Leave your smokes.
I'll play for you.
- Thanks, Mike.
Listen, he calls you an idiot, you take it like a man, okay?
Just do not leave without signing them.
- I appreciate it, Sergeant.
- You got it.
What the hell happened to your hair, Rene?
Look like a goddamn corpse.
Three points of contact on that rope at all times.
Next four.
Over the side.
Let's go.
Keep moving.
Next four, over the side.
Just keep your eye on the guy below you.
That's all you gotta look at.
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.
Keep three points of contact on the rope at all times.
You see?
No big thing.
Just one step at a time and keep your hands on the vertical rope.
Remember, once you're in the boat move away from the rope.
Just make sure you keep three points of contact on the rope.
I got him!
All right, get that man out of the water.
Give me a hand.
Grab his pack.
Don't worry about him, Doc.
All right, quit skylarking!
Keep it moving!
He'll be fine.
Our target, Island X, is an ugly, smelly, dirty little scab of rock called Iwo Jima.
It means "Sulfur Island," which accounts for the smell.
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop, you ask me.
After 20 straight days of bombing you won't find a blade of grass or a twig on it.
It wasn't that pretty to start with.
Captain?
Lwo's just five-and-a-half miles long, two-and-a-half wide.
There's a lump down at the bottom.
That's Mount Suribachi.
On the maps in front of you the island is white.
Not much of it.
The black dots represent known enemy emplacements.
Coastal defense guns, dual-mount dual-purpose guns, covered artillery emplacements.
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes, and earth-covered structures.
I don't see any barracks or any other structures.
That's right.
And we still don't know why.
Now, this isn't just any island to them.
This isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, or Saipan.
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders in eight square miles.
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.
It's up to us to convince them.
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.
The 8th Ammo Company will land here to re-supply.
The Suribachi's guns are the biggest problem.
They can hit any point on the island.
We're sitting ducks until we take them out.
That's our job.
We cut across the island, right at the base, slit its throat, lop off its head.
And we take that mountain.
We take that mountain, we take their big guns.
We take their eyes.
Okay, I'm heading in.
Follow me.
Let's put a good show on for the Marines.
Close it up.
Take it right down to the deck.
Yeah, boys!
Man overboard portside!
See him?
Throw me a line!
He's right there.
- Where is he?
- Watch out, watch out, watch out.
Hawaii's that way!
Just keep paddling, Mac, we'll catch you on the way back!
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!
They're not gonna stop.
What?
None of them are.
They can't.
So much for "No man left behind. "
- Sir.
- Come on in.
Look, I've had to make a few other changes.
I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
- You bet.
Trouble is, I already told my men I'd see them through this.
That your James Cagney impersonation?
'Cause I've heard better.
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.
Look, this isn't your first time through this.
- You don't need to prove anything.
- No, sir.
You're not the best sergeant I've ever had, you're just the best one that's still walking.
- Block's a good man.
- Yes, sir, he is.
The men know him, he can step right in.
You know, I have actually thought this through.
Platoon sergeant puts you further away from the bullets.
I already gave them my word, sir.
I told them I'd bring them all home to their mothers which means I already lied to half of them.
Can't lie to the rest.
- How are your men?
- They'll do fine.
Except maybe Gagnon.
Our own Tyrone Power?
Yes, sir.
He's a good man, just might be better use further back from the lines.
I'll use him as a runner.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
Now get out of here.
Hear the good news, Doc?
We're going in with the first waves.
Hey, you do that again I'll take your head off!
Fucking dominoes.
Iggy, have you ever heard news you considered to be bad?
The first ones off the ship, Doc.
Means we don't go over the side of the ship.
We hop on a tractor, they drive us right there.
Oh, shit, that is good news.
You see?
What'd I tell you?
What's going on?
Look at that.
We're killing them!
We're killing them, Doc.
I was promised 10 days of shelling.
You're giving me three and saying that's the best you can do?
I don't give a shit!
My men hit that beach with less than 10 and I'll be taking them home to their mamas in buckets!
Yeah, I know exactly why.
Because every Navy man with a scrambled egg on his chest wants to offload us here and sail to Japan so they can be there for the big finish, tell their kids they captured the Emperor all by themselves.
Well, you aren't going to Japan unless we take this piece of shit island!
These little pricks are dug in!
Okay, appreciate that, Jim.
Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
I'm okay.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
Jesus, Iggy, just leave me alone, all right?
How about you guys?
Knife?
Bayonet?
Kick in the ass?
How about you, Doc?
Sharpen your knife?
You sharpened it three times already.
Well, then I better make sure I didn't nick it.
Good man, Doc.
- Hey, Doc.
- Yeah.
When we land, try not to wave this kit around too much.
They got sharpshooters that are trained to look for them.
And they know that if they take out a corpsman another dozen Marines will die unattended.
All right?
Okay, Mike.
Yeah, right there.
Close the damn door.
For God's sake.
Yeah, like that's gonna help.
That your girlfriend, Chief?
Bet she's a pretty damn good-looking squaw.
Bet you're missing her, and that little wigwam of yours.
Welcome, all Marines off Iwo Jima.
We have a long-time wait...
It's what they do to prisoners,
- at least the lucky ones.
- Jesus.
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think about waving a white bandanna.
Poor Marines, so far from home for no good reason.
Think of your girls back home, waiting for you.
But a girl cannot stay home every night.
So who do you think they're with tonight?
And will she let him kiss her?
And will he comfort her at your funeral?
This sweet music is to make you think of your girls back home who are missing you.
This is all for now.
I'll see you tomorrow night.
Gunners!
Move, let's go!
Let's go, get up on the berm!
Gunners!
We're clear!
Get up the berm!
Baker Company, move out!
- Seen Second Platoon?
- I don't see them.
First Squad, move it out!
God, this place reeks.
- Go, go, go!
- Move out!
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go!
Go!
Go, go!
Drop your packs!
Go!
All clear!
- Jesus, you needed some exercise?
- He got lost.
A hundred landing craft heading for one beach and this guy gets lost.
Now I'm glad we did.
Jesus, what a mess.
Any theories why they ain't shooting?
It's getting on my nerves.
Maybe they're all dead.
What do you think, Doc?
You think they're all dead?
Mike, take six men and bring that gun onto the beach.
Second Platoon, let's move out!
Stay down.
Come on.
Move!
Move!
- Get down!
- Take cover!
Move out!
Cover fire!
Pour it on!
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!
Corpsman!
I'm gonna sling your arm and then I'll give you a shot for the pain!
Move, move!
Off the beach!
Take cover!
You got a girl back home, Marine?
We're gonna make sure she sees you, all right?
I need pressure on this wound!
Where's the fire coming from?
Where are they?
Look for a flash, shoot at it!
Let's go, let...
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!
You're over!
Third Squad, forward!
Move!
Where are they, sir?
We got ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock, pillbox!
Sergeant!
- Sergeant!
I think I can clear that out.
- What?
All right, you go.
Here.
Take these.
Check your weapon.
Yeah?
Go!
Cover!
Cover him!
Cover, cover!
Son-of-a-bitch.
Let's go!
Go!
Move it out!
Go, go, go!
Down, down, down!
It's clear.
Good work.
I thought you said it was clear!
It was!
Shit, I guess they're not in there firing at us then.
Lindberg!
Yeah!
Light it up!
I'll cover you, Ice!
Don't cover shit!
There's already enough people shooting!
One bullet and this thing goes up like a Roman candle!
Go!
Shift fire!
Shift your fire!
Go, go!
Shift your fire!
Shift your fire!
Go!
Move it out!
Hit the deck!
Stay down!
Wait for support!
Is this a bad battle or what?
It's a fucking slaughter.
Christ Jesus!
Get a machine gun team set up over here, now!
Thank God!
Tanks!
Runner!
Get those tanks up here!
Oh, shit.
Get down!
Corporal, watch your left flank!
Let's go without them!
Move out!
Move out!
Lggy, you gotta lift your side, he's gonna roll off.
Got it, Doc!
Incoming!
Move, move, move, move!
Keep moving!
Get that LVT up on the beach!
Keep moving!
You're next, pal, we're getting you out of here.
Move it!
Great news.
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa, 'cause that's where we're headed.
Not you and me.
Captain Severance asked me who else was in that picture, and Christ if I could remember, but it was Mike and Doc and Franklin and me and Hank Hansen but I just remembered, you were there, too.
I wasn't there.
'Course you were.
Neither was Hank.
He raised the first flag.
It was Harlon Block that raised that one.
Shit.
I told them it was Hank.
You weren't there, Mr. Smart Ass, how'd you know it was Harlon?
- You tell them it was me?
- No.
Like I said, I just remembered.
Good, keep your mouth shut.
They know there was somebody else, you can see it in the picture.
Then pick someone dead.
They don't want somebody dead, you dumb redskin, they want to ship us back to the States.
What did I tell you?
I wasn't there.
- You hear?
- All right.
Just settle down.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're not going anywhere.
Who the hell says?
This is horseshit.
You wounded, son?
No, sir.
Well, did you take out a nest of Japs butt-naked with your bare hands?
'Cause if I'm gonna give up my seat to a hero he better have a good goddamn story to tell.
No, sir.
Then enjoy it, 'cause they'll forget you before Christmas.
The sixth man, you got a name?
Sorry, still don't remember.
It's a damn shame, 'cause I promised the Major you'd know who it was.
Fact, you not knowing throws a doubt on you being one of the flag-raisers yourself.
Since no one wants to be embarrassed, the moment you land they'll turn you around, ship you off to Okinawa in time to meet your buddies on the beach.
So, why don't you stop screwing with me?
Give me a damn name.
Gangway!
Gangway!
Let's go, let's go!
Gangway!
Where the hell is that son-of-a-bitch?
Hayes!
Hayes?
Hayes, get your red ass over here!
Make me look like I don't know what my own men are doing with a flag the size of my mother's house?
God damn it, Ira, you shouldn't have lied to me.
You made me look like a complete asshole.
We're gonna miss you around here.
Good luck.
Now your name's in the paper, too.
Just heard your doctor say we're postponing your operation.
You're being shipped back to the mainland.
Everybody who saw that picture thought planting the flag meant victory.
That's all they wanted to know.
Victory.
Within a few weeks of that picture being taken, half the men in it were dead.
Mrs. Hansen!
Mrs. Hansen!
Did you know Hank was a hero?
- Are you proud of him, Mrs. Hansen?
- What was he like as a boy?
Look this way, please, ma'am.
What do you have to say about your son?
But somehow being a part of it meant something.
Looking at it, you could believe their sacrifice was not a waste.
Yeah, I might have thought that was Harlon, too.
It is.
Belle, their names are right here.
It's not him.
And he would be alive and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.
You think about that when you look at his picture, Ed.
And I need to rush home and change because there's the Governor's banquet and then there's the parade.
Imagine, the Governor is coming here to meet us.
Now, I'm wearing blue so, if...
- Are you going to change?
- We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin from CBS World News.
A press association has just announced that President Roosevelt is dead.
The President died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
All we know so far is that the President died at Warm Springs in Georgia.
Further updates every hour.
Temperatures will remain the same today, in the mid-30s to low 40s with clear skies.
Hello?
Yes.
Of course.
No, we understand.
It wouldn't be right.
Thank you.
Here he is, gentlemen.
Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.
Senator Haddigan.
I'd like you to meet Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Damn good to meet you.
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.
Sorry?
That's Pima Indian talk, boy, don't you know your own language?
Took forever to memorize the damn gibberish.
Sorry, I've been away from the reservation too long, Senator.
- Doc.
- Ira.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
- That's you.
- Go, go, go, go.
Go.
Please welcome
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley,
Private First Class Ira Hayes,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon!
Holy shit.
Come in, come in, come in.
Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Bud Gurber.
- You showing the boys the sights?
- We saw a hell of a ball game.
That's great.
The bar's there, help yourself.
I got some briefing sheets for you here, just some simple things we want you to say.
Mostly, "Buy bonds," can't say that too often.
Itineraries, those are changing every couple minutes.
Everybody wants to meet you guys.
I got women sending up envelopes with stockings in them, notes written in lipstick.
We won't mention that to the press, am I right?
Have a drink, for Christ's sake.
My God, what you boys must have seen over there.
I've been watching the newsreels.
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.
So, we got a hell of a lot of money to raise, not a lot of time.
White House tomorrow, then we trot you over to shake hands with a couple of hundred Congressmen who won't pull a penny out of their pockets.
Politicians and actors.
You put them in a restaurant together, they'd die of old age before picking up the check.
Then New York City, Times Square, dinners with various hoi polloi, then Chicago...
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?
That's what we're calling the mothers of the dead flag-raisers.
You present each mother with a flag, they say a few words, people will shit money.
It'll be so moving.
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.
Lovely woman.
She knows how close you and her son were.
He wrote home about you.
She is very, very much looking forward to meeting you.
Hank wasn't in the picture.
Sorry?
Hank didn't raise that flag.
He raised the other one, the real flag.
The what?
The real...
The real flag?
There's a real flag?
Yeah, ours was the replacement flag.
We put it up when they took the other one down.
Am I the only one getting a headache here?
You know about this?
It was after it was already in the papers.
The mothers had already been told, but...
That's it, that's beautiful.
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Yeah, why tell me?
I'm only the guy that has to explain it to 150 million Americans.
Who is in the goddamn picture?
Are any of you guys in the goddamn picture?
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.
Six guys raising a flag over Iwo Jima.
Victory is ours.
You're three of them, right?
This was the fifth day, sir.
The battle went on for 35 more.
Well, what'd you do, raise a goddamn flag every time you stopped for lunch?
Can I hit this guy?
You know what, I don't give a shit, you're in the picture, you raised the flag, that's the story we're selling, boys.
Are you deaf?
Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?
Harlon Block.
That's whose mother should be here if anyone's should be.
You know, I think this whole damn thing is a farce, you ask me.
You know what they're calling this bond drive?
The Mighty Seventh.
They might've called it the
"We're Flat Fucking Broke And Can't Even Afford Bullets
"So We're Begging For Your Pennies" bond drive, but it didn't have quite the ring.
They could've called it that, though, because the last four bond drives came up so short we just printed money instead.
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street, he'll tell you our dollar is next to worthless, we borrowed so much.
And nobody is lending any more.
Ships aren't being built.
Tanks aren't being built.
Machine guns, bazookas, hand grenades, zip.
You think this is a farce?
You want to go back to your buddies?
Well, stuff some rocks in your pockets before you get on the plane because that's all we got left to throw at the Japanese.
And don't be surprised if your plane doesn't make it off the runway because the fuel dumps are empty.
And our good friends, the Arabs, are only taking bullion.
If we don't raise $14 billion, and that's million with a "B," this war is over by the end of the month.
We make a deal with the Japanese, we give whatever they want and we come home, because you've seen them fight, and they sure as shit ain't giving up.
$14 billion.
The last three drives didn't make that much all together.
People on the street corners, they looked at this picture and they took hope.
Don't ask me why, I think it's a crappy picture myself.
You can't even see your faces.
But it said we can win this war, are winning this war, we just need you to dig a little deeper.
They want to give us that money.
No, they want to give it to you.
But you, you don't want to ask for it.
You don't want to give them hope.
You want to explain about this person and that flag.
Well, that's your choice.
Because if we admit we made a mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about and that will be that.
Gentlemen.
Mr. President, here they are.
- Well, hello.
Good to see you.
- Mr. President.
Darn good to see you, boys.
Heard you had a hell of a fight on your hands out there, hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation in Arizona, am I right?
Yes, Mr. President.
Being an Indian, you are a truer American than any of us.
Bet your people are proud to see you wear that uniform.
Very proud, sir.
They should be.
Well, I want to thank you for coming all this way to Washington to help us out.
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific now we need you to fight for a mountain of cash.
- And I don't expect you'll let us down.
- No, sir.
Good.
Go get it.
That's the end of this ceremony.
Let's take a look at this famous photo over here, see if I can pick you out.
My gosh.
There you are.
Boys.
Boys, this one's on me.
To those who can't be with us.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon.
May we have your autograph?
I suppose.
And your name is?
I don't know about you, but I get the impression
I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.
You're such a hero.
I feel honored to be in your presence.
That's just not true.
That's professional work.
Here, to professionals.
Here they are.
You're the guys in the photograph, right?
I heard you were on the train.
Let me shake your hands, John Tennack.
John Bradley.
These boys are with me, Harvard and Yale types, didn't fight a lick.
Pappies all rich sons-of-bitches.
Boys, shake hands with some real war heroes.
Excuse me for one moment.
You can buy them a drink while you're at it.
That's right.
Drinks for these men all the way around.
And you're the other one, aren't you?
John Tennack, Tennack Homes.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Pleased to meet you.
Have a drink, come on.
And here's my card.
Listen to me, Rene, when you get finished being famous you come see me because if you can sell bonds, you can sell homes.
Now, they're not gonna build homes anymore, they're gonna deliver them.
- You heard of prefab homes?
- No, sir.
Well, you will.
And you hang on to that card and you come see me, you hear?
- All right?
- Certainly will.
All right.
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?
If Mike and the guys could see us.
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it, would they?
Harlon!
Franklin!
Can you imagine Franklin on this train
eating at the dining car with all the silver?
We shouldn't be here, Doc.
There's gonna be a Hallelujah Day
When the boys have all come home to stay
And a million bands begin to play
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
And when we've lit the torch of liberty
In each blacked-out land across the sea
Ira!
Hey, Ira!
We heard the picture was posed!
What?
We heard you posed the picture!
Hey, Doc!
We're bigger than life, Doc!
And we'll heave a mighty sigh
When each gal can kiss the boy she kissed goodbye
And they'll come marching down Fifth Avenue
The United Nations in review
When this lovely dream has all come true
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
Good job.
Thank you.
Thank you, girls!
And now, here are the men you've been waiting to meet, the men in white.
Right behind me here, the heroes of Iwo Jima,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon,
Private First Class Ira Hayes, and Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley!
Thank you.
It's good of you people to come out tonight in support of the war effort.
We really need you to buy bonds, that's for sure.
'Cause we can't win the war without your help.
As far as us being the heroes of Iwo Jima, that's just not the case.
We really didn't do much at all.
Especially him.
Especially me.
I was just a runner.
That's it.
We put up a flag.
The pole we attached it to was heavy, so it took a number of us.
We had our picture taken doing it.
The real heroes are dead on that island.
And we'd appreciate it if you bought bonds in honor of them.
Thank you.
Jump on any grenades, Ira?
Take out any machine gun nests I missed?
At least I fired my weapon.
All right, knock it off.
You hit anything or were you too drunk then, too?
What?
Guys!
Come on!
Stop it.
Knock it off.
The tall man with the high hat will be coming down your way
Get your savings out when you hear him shout
"Any bonds today?"
Any bonds today?
Bonds of freedom that's what I'm selling
Any bonds today?
Rene, right here.
Sit between these two boys.
Here comes the freedom man
Asking you to buy a share of freedom today ...for us and they need our help.
And, if you think about it, I think you'll realize that buying more bonds is not just the right thing to do but the only thing to do.
Yes, this war has gone on too long.
We have given too many lives.
And its cost...
- Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
- Strawberry.
...has been far too high.
But if we waver now, if we don't dig deep and give more than we think we can then those sacrifices would be wasted...
Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
...and those lives lost in vain.
Let's move!
Go, go!
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over.
Where the hell are our tanks?
Stuck in the sand.
Captain says you're to go without them.
Christ.
That's real good work you're doing there, Rene.
All right, prepare to move out.
Pass the word.
Second Platoon!
Move!
Move!
Move!
All right, Second Platoon, on your feet!
Let's move out!
Jackass.
Let's move out!
Go, go!
Move, move, move!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Second Platoon, move out!
Doc!
Doc, get out of there!
Corpsman!
Doc!
Doc, get the hell out of there!
May I have your attention, please.
Train number 48 with service from New York City, Boston,
Rochester, New York,
Toledo, Ohio, and South Bend, Indiana is now arriving on Track 7.
Train number 48 now arriving on Track number 7.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.
- Come on, boys.
- Let's go.
- Watch your step, ma'am.
- Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the heroes of Iwo Jima.
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.
Private First Class Ira Hayes.
And Private First Class Rene Gagnon.
Rene!
That's my boyfriend!
Who the hell is that?
I don't know.
- Rene, is that your girl?
- Hey, what do they call you?
How about a photo?
Hey, look at that!
What's your name, doll?
What's your name?
Hey, she's a beauty.
Let's go find a saloon.
Smile, boys.
Give them their money's worth.
Hey, Doc, how's the tour going for you?
Thank you.
Where exactly are you staying?
- I'm not sure yet.
- Just forget about that.
Senator, I'd like you to meet Corpsman John Bradley.
- Doc, right?
- Yes, sir.
Nice to meet you, Senator.
Good to meet you, young man.
Now, we appreciate everything you've done and everything you're doing.
- Thank you, sir.
- Quite all right.
This is Captain White.
- Colonel Johns.
- We're proud of you, Corpsman.
And then Colonel McCourtney.
- Major General Green.
- Nice to meet you.
Senator, this is Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Of course!
Now I hear you used a tomahawk on those Japs.
Is that true, Chief?
No, sir.
Well, tell them you did, makes a better story, huh?
- Attaboy.
- This is Captain Green.
John?
Madeline Evelley.
I recognize you from all the photographs.
I'm Hank's mom.
It's so nice to meet you, ma'am.
Hank was always talking about you.
This is PFC Rene Gagnon.
Pleasure to meet you, son.
Thanks for everything.
- My pleasure.
- Not at all.
Ira, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Strank, Mike's mom.
It's all right.
When I got the telegram, I...
I don't know what I'm trying to say here.
Knowing he was with you that day and seeing him in that photograph,
I don't know why it makes me feel better, but it does.
- It's so silly, isn't it?
- No, it's not.
How are you, son?
Thank you very much.
We're the largest furniture wholesaler in Illinois.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
- I'll make sure he calls.
- Well, thank you.
Thank you.
Are you Rene?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Franklin's mother.
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.
I'm Pauline, Rene's girlfriend.
Would you mind?
Paper said that's Hank, and I honestly can't tell.
It's horrible of a mother not to know her own son, isn't it?
But that's him, isn't it?
Well, to be honest, ma'am, it happened so quick, and with everything that was going on it's kind of hard to remember who was where.
But...
Yeah, I think...
I think that's where he was.
That's Hank.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Excuse us.
Take him outside.
I'm Pauline.
- Very nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
He was the best Marine I ever knew.
Thank you.
- You okay, Chief?
- Oh, Christ!
I'm okay.
Yeah, you look it.
You're gonna screw this up, aren't you?
You're gonna screw it up for all of us.
I've got him.
Get some sleep, Ira.
- Mike?
- Yeah?
- You see this?
- What?
- Mike!
- Oh, shit, go!
He's killing me!
Hey, Doc, you think they got them all?
What?
Well, they're not shooting at us.
Maybe we killed them all.
Or they ran off in the night or something.
Or they're waiting for us to start climbing.
Third Platoon!
Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.
- Just us?
- Yeah, just us, Igg.
All right, Third Platoon, move!
I tag along?
Yeah, you can lead the way if you want.
Get a good shot of my face.
It's your ass I'm gonna make famous, Hank.
Hey, that'll work for me, too.
Lieutenant, if you make it to the top, put this up.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, Iggy.
They never shoot at the first patrol.
- They don't?
- No.
They want us to go up to the top, signal to the others that it's okay, then shoot everybody else as they come up the mountain.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Unless of course they want to make an example of us and discourage all the others.
I think you're full of crap, you know that, Hank?
Really?
Jesus.
Thank God that ain't us.
Told you.
Boots, spread them out and put them on a line.
Set up a perimeter!
First Squad!
- Hank?
Find me a pole.
- Yeah.
Let's put this flag up.
Watch it.
Right over here.
Right here.
That's good.
That's good.
Right here, right here.
Got that end?
Hold that steady.
Lindberg.
- Hey, who's got rope?
- Right here.
Give me something.
Yeah, good.
That work?
Do it, fellas.
Keep it coming.
USMC!
USMC!
Shit, look at that!
Jeez, look at that.
Get down!
Take cover!
Cover with that. 30!
- Watch it!
Twenty yards down, Hank!
- You see them?
- I got about 20 yards, left side.
- Lindberg, get the flamethrower!
- Boots, you see them?
- Cover right!
- About 20 yards down!
Duck one!
- You see them?
Keep the cover on!
Second Squad, you see them?
Get me some grenades!
I see them!
You see them?
Right flank, over to the right!
Cover me, I'm going down!
Careful, Iggy.
Easy.
All clear!
Okay, guys, who wants to be famous?
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
- God damn it.
Strank!
- Sir?
They want a phone line run up to the top of the mountain.
Let me guess, they picked us.
Second Platoon, let's go.
Get some exercise.
Let's go!
Get off your ass.
Oh, shit!
Hope it still works, 'cause you're not getting mine!
- Get Forrestal!
- All right, then.
I don't know whose idea it was, Mr. Secretary.
Well, it was goddamn brilliant.
I want that flag, Holland.
Mark my words, raising that son-of-a-bitch means a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.
I want that flag.
Yes, sir.
I'll make sure no one touches it.
You can count on me.
Fuck that.
That flag belongs to the men in this battalion.
That son-of-a-bitch thinks that our men died taking this ground so we could hand over our flag to some politician to pin to his wall?
He's out of his goddamn mind!
Get me that flag, and find another one to replace it.
You've gotta be shitting me.
Gagnon!
Get your ass over here.
Hey.
Hi, fellas.
How's it going?
Missed a beautiful shot, Joe.
It's that kind of day.
- Hey, Mike.
- Hell of a view, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant!
Captain says he wants that flag.
He wants this flag?
Yes, sir.
- We just put the damn thing up.
- Yes, sir.
Some kind of flag shortage?
He wants you to put this one up instead.
Hey, Mike.
Do me a favor and put this up, will you?
Yes, sir.
All right, let's find a pole.
Take the flag down, boys.
Captain's orders.
You heard him, let's do it.
There you go.
Lordy, she's a heavy one.
All right, hang on.
Put this on.
One hell of a view, huh?
Good view from up here.
Yes, I'd say so myself.
All right.
- Not in your way here, am I, Joe?
- Nah, I'm fine, thanks.
Hey, Doc, you wanna give us a hand here?
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.
Ready?
Ready?
Let's go.
You get it?
I don't know.
I wish I could've seen their faces.
Nobody even noticed that second flag going up.
Everybody saw that damn picture and made up their own story about it.
But your dad and the others knew what they had done and what they had not done.
All your friends dying, it's hard not to be called a hero for saving somebody's life.
But for putting up a pole?
You gotta be kidding.
Hey!
It took a lot of talented folks a long time to make that thing.
Just wait till tonight when it's lit properly and there's thousands of cheering people in the stands.
It's gonna look a lot better.
So, stadium lights come down, spotlight comes up and you get your cue.
You charge up this thing with the flag, you plant it at the top.
You smile, you wave.
You know the drill.
You want us to plant the flag on a pile of papier-mâché.
Hey, that's show biz.
And try and stand how you stood the first time you planted it.
Just, you know, pretend the other three guys are with you.
The dead guys.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, not a problem.
Good.
But where do we imagine Hank is standing?
Sorry?
Well, seeing that he wasn't there, it'll be kind of hard for us to leave a space for him.
I think you know exactly where he was.
You pointed him out to his mother.
This is bullshit.
I planted that damn thing once, and I'm not doing it again.
- Hayes!
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
Hayes.
Hayes, get your ass back here or you're going on report.
Hayes!
You wanna do your damn job?
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Come on!
He's with me!
Hey, he's with me!
- Back off!
- Sir, he's with me.
Okay?
He's with me.
Ira, put the goddamn chair down!
- Put the chair down, son!
- Put the chair down, Ira!
Tell them drop their sticks!
Ira, they're cops, they're supposed to have nightsticks.
You're not supposed to be in the street swinging a chair.
- Calm down, son.
- Sir, turn around, please.
That poster right there?
The one on the end, that's him.
- That's him?
- Yes, sir.
You read the papers?
Christ.
We got another fucking hero.
Get him out of here.
- Can you do that?
- Yes, sir.
Put the goddamn chair down.
And let's go.
Did you start this?
He didn't serve me!
I don't make the rules.
We don't serve Indians.
He needs to go sleep it off.
Soldier Field.
You hear that?
What the hell is that?
I can't figure it out.
Keep an eye out.
It sounds like it's coming from up there.
They're using grenades.
They're killing themselves.
Ira, let's go.
Come on.
Let's go, Ira.
Come on.
Thank God.
Jesus.
Look at you, Chief.
You found him.
Holy shit.
You would have to pick today.
Vandegrift is here with enough brass to start a fucking band.
Come on, let's go.
Can you walk?
- Yes, sir.
- By yourself?
All right, look.
I don't care if you have to carry him get him to the top, plant that flag, and don't fucking fall off.
Get him in his stuff.
I'll stall these guys for as long as I can.
Hurry up.
Jesus Christ.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Cover!
Harlon!
Harlon!
Get your fire team up in that position!
O'Hare!
First Fire Team!
Work around!
BAR, you, on the side of the ridge!
Covering fire, boys, go, go, go!
Jackson, work your team around to the left!
Cover!
Left flank!
Left flank!
Franklin, Gust, go check it out!
Hustle up, boys!
We got them!
Clear!
One hell of an experience.
Move out!
Cease fire!
They're my men!
You're targeting our men!
You're targeting our...
Get me another radio!
Sergeant?
Sergeant!
Mike!
Mike, Mike, Mike.
Mike?
Mike.
Hey, where's Doc?
Corpsman!
Oh, shit.
How's his breathing?
Harlon, move, buddy.
Hey, Mike.
Mike, Mike, can you hear us?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on, Mike.
Mike?
Mike, can you hear us?
All right, let's go!
Move out!
I'm gonna get a stretcher.
Let's take him down, move him off the beach.
Ladies and gentlemen, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Corpsman!
Hank!
Hank!
Doc, they killed me.
Harlon!
Doc, they killed me.
Come on, Harlon.
Harlon, stay with me.
Franklin!
I'm fine, Ira.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Lggy!
Lggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Lggy!
Does it open?
Lggy!
Lggy!
Lggy, are you down there?
Lggy!
Can't tell who it is, but he's one of ours.
I had to go outside to throw up.
Look what they did to the poor son-of-a-bitch.
You okay, Chief?
Just let it go.
If that doesn't pry open their wallets, nothing will.
Jesus Christ, he's drunk.
Goddamn Indians.
Come on, Chief.
Let's get you home.
That's not what I hear.
I called around, I'm not stupid.
He's been drunk since he started this damn tour, making a spectacle of himself.
Just about choked that poor woman at the reception, blubbering.
Jesus Christ, you're supposed to be watching these men.
Yes, sir.
Well, he's making us look like regular asses.
Well, with all due respect, sir, he never wanted to come on this trip in the first place.
We had to pull him, kicking and screaming, off that boat.
He wants to be with his unit.
What unit?
They're all fucking dead.
This is how he honors those men?
By drinking and throwing up, and...
You know what?
He wants it, great, we'll send him back.
Get him packed and on a train today.
He's an embarrassment to the uniform.
Yes, sir.
I'll do it.
Yeah, no, that's...
That's good.
That's what I want.
I know it's a good thing, raising the money and that, 'cause we need it.
But,
I can't take them calling me a hero.
All I did was try not to get shot.
Some of the things I saw done, things I did,
they weren't things to be proud of, you know?
Mike...
Mike was a hero.
You ever meet him?
No.
Best Marine I ever met.
You know, Chief, I think if Mike was sitting here instead of you he'd be saying the same thing about himself,
not being a hero.
Maybe.
He was a good guy.
But I think that he would be ashamed of me, seeing me the way I am.
Think I could see my ma before they ship me off?
Think they'd do that?
See my ma?
I'm sorry, Ira.
We got stories now to tell our kids, I guess.
Keep your head down.
All aboard.
Good luck, Chief.
I think I saw him once after that.
It was maybe six or seven years after the war.
I was working as a salesman, doing a lot of driving.
I was driving west across Texas.
I was just trying to get where I was going so I could get home.
And I saw this guy hitchhiking on the side of the road.
And, for a second, I thought it might've been him.
I always regret that I didn't stop, but I was in a hurry.
And he was an Indian.
We always told the press that Ira insisted that he was going back to fight with his unit which was at least partially true, but
that isn't what got the headlines.
We're engaged.
Excuse me a minute, darling.
- Hey, Doc?
- Yeah?
- Got a minute?
- Yeah.
I'll see you at the car.
- You hear I'm getting married?
- I did, Rene.
That's great.
Yeah, it's something she wants.
She waited for me all this time.
She's not used to all this, but she's a good girl.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
So, I was wondering if you'd be my best man.
Me?
Don't you have somebody at home, a buddy, you'd rather ask?
Well, I didn't really make many.
The ones who didn't go, it's...
Well, it's hard to even talk to them.
You know?
Yeah, I know.
I'd be proud to.
Thank you.
I better go drag her away from them before she announces
I'm gonna be president of General Motors or something.
All right.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Rene, you're a lucky man.
- Big smile, Mrs. Gagnon!
- Say cheese!
I couldn't complain because the press loved them, so they wrote more articles and people bought more bonds.
The tour went on with just Rene and your dad.
And the true heroes are the men who didn't make it home from Iwo Jima, the men who died at Iwo Jima and in other campaigns.
We ask that you honor the memory of those men by buying the war bonds and helping us to win this war.
Thank you.
City after city, I thought the damn thing'd never end.
And this rumor kept going around that the photograph had been staged.
I remember your dad telling them that he wished he'd known he was having his picture taken because he would've ducked the hell out of it.
Whose idea was it?
Who wanted to stage the thing?
Come on, it was you?
Was there truth to the rumor that that picture was staged, Doc?
- Come on!
Doc?
- Can you answer that?
I remember when your dad got shot.
All hell was busting loose.
People back home saw that picture and thought it was over when we took Suribachi.
We wished.
Anyways, we're pinned down.
Mortars, shells, machine guns.
Fire coming from every which direction, right?
And we hear somebody call, "Corpsman down. "
Corpsman down!
Blood was spurting out of his throat, and Doc was doing everything he could.
And the Corpsman looks up at him and he knows what this means, to be shot in the neck.
He knows he's dying, you can see that.
But still in his eyes, he's pleading with Doc to save his life.
And Doc can't.
- You okay, Doc?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah, you look fine.
- I'm okay.
Keep down, all right?
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.
Okay.
Corpsman.
Corpsman!
For God sake, Corpsman!
Corpsman?
Corpsman.
Incoming!
Let me see.
It's not that bad.
You're gonna be okay.
All right?
Just stay with me.
Look at me.
Took us a half-hour to find your dad.
He could've bled to death.
Coming down.
Thanks.
Vets'll tell you about being hit but not wanting to leave their buddies.
Usually, they're lying.
You'll take any excuse to get out of there.
But it happens.
You get the feeling you're letting them down.
I could see that in your dad's face.
He wanted to go, he'd seen enough.
But he didn't want to leave us.
Now, he was a hell of a good man, your dad.
Yeah.
While we were sitting there on the beach, we heard this great roar.
And we looked up.
That was the first of thousands of landings on Iwo.
- Look at that.
- Yeah.
How about that.
I'm gonna head back, all right?
Good luck.
That island saved a lot of lives.
A lot of lives.
I don't know what else to tell you.
After the bond tour my dad finally got his operation.
By the time he got home the war was over.
First thing he did was ask my mom to marry him.
Ira tried to get on with his life and put it all behind him.
Thank you for having me here today.
It's an honor to be in front of such a strong people.
Because of the war white men will understand Indians a lot better.
And it's going to be a better world.
But life had other plans for him.
You're...
You're him, aren't you?
You're the hero, right?
Great.
All right, kids, go get your picture taken.
Oh, that's great.
That's great.
All right, now say cheese.
Cheese!
That's great!
Okay.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Thanks.
- Come on.
- That's a hero, kids.
Hero, lift this basket, will you?
It's too heavy for me.
Rene tried to take advantage of those offers he'd received on the bond tour.
Yes.
G-A-G-N-O-N.
Right.
Pronounced Rene.
Rene, yes.
- Okay, I actually called last week.
- Yes.
Okay, yes.
Mr. Gagnon.
I gave Mr. Tennack your message.
I'm sure he'll call you.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
But he was yesterday's hero.
He even applied for a job at the local police station.
They said he wasn't qualified.
After working the factory with Pauline he tried a few things but spent the rest of his life as a janitor.
But Ira...
Ira!
You got a visitor.
Ira always made the news.
I could never find out why he did it, but one day Ira just took off.
He walked and hitched over 1,300 miles from Arizona to Texas.
He found Harlon Block's father working his field.
His wife, Belle, had left him soon after they discovered Harlon died.
She never forgave him for letting her son go off to war.
And Ira told him the truth, that it had been his son who raised the flag with them, his son in the photograph.
And then he just turned and walked away.
Though the flag-raising meant nothing to him, he somehow knew it would mean everything to them.
Thanks for calling.
Just as Belle knew all along.
The press soon found out and called Hank's mom with the news that it wasn't her son after all.
The last time they all saw each other was at the unveiling of the Marine Corps War Memorial.
And even though he planted the first flag above Iwo Jima,
Hank's mother and father weren't invited.
Ira.
It's good to see you, Ira.
Hell of a statue.
It wasn't long after that that they found Ira.
The papers said he died of exposure.
There was no autopsy.
It was about that same time when my father got in his car early one morning telling my mom he had something to do.
He drove to a town on the other side of Wisconsin where Iggy's mom lived.
Ever since she heard the news about her son she'd been trying to find out how he died, and no one would tell her.
I never found out what he told her, but I can pretty much guarantee it wasn't the truth.
My mother would ask him what was troubling him.
He would never say.
And every year, as it got close to Memorial Day, the reporters would start calling asking to interview my father.
No, I'm sorry.
He's fishing in Canada.
We were always instructed to say the same thing.
Okay.
Thanks.
When Mr. McCandless retired, my father bought the funeral home where he'd worked since coming home.
He spent the rest of his life running the business and raising his family.
He never spoke about the war or about the flag-raising, never told us anything.
The first time I heard any of these stories was after he died.
Where is he?
Oh, God.
He's not here, Dad.
He died.
Who?
Who died?
Lggy.
Iggy.
Christ, poor Iggy.
I hadn't thought of him for years.
How do you know about Iggy?
You were calling for him, when you collapsed.
I wasn't looking for Iggy.
I was looking for you.
I wanted to...
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry I wasn't a better father.
Talked to you more.
I just...
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
You were the best father a man could have.
Did I ever tell you they took us swimming?
No, Dad.
After we planted the flag, we came down off the mountain and they let us swim.
It was the funniest thing.
All this fighting and we were jumping around in the water like kids.
That's the way I remember Iggy now.
I finally came to the conclusion that maybe he was right.
Maybe there's no such thing as heroes.
Maybe there are just people like my dad.
I finally came to understand why they were so uncomfortable being called heroes.
Heroes are something we create, something we need.
It's a way for us to understand what is almost incomprehensible, how people could sacrifice so much for us.
But for my dad and these men, the risks they took, the wounds they suffered, they did that for their buddies.
They may have fought for their country, but they died for their friends.
For the man in front, for the man beside them.
And if we wish to truly honor these men, we should remember them the way they really were, the way my dad remembered them.
Come on, Doc!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
For God sakes!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Honey, what's wrong?
Every jackass thinks he knows what war is.
Especially those who've never been in one.
We like things nice and simple, good and evil, heroes and villains.
There's always plenty of both.
Most of the time, they are not who we think they are.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where...
Where is he?
Where is he?
Mr. Bradley?
Mr. B?
You okay?
- Where is he?
- Where is who?
Where is he?
Where did he go?
Where...
Where is he?
All right.
Just stay right here, okay?
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
It'll be okay.
Where is he?
Most guys I knew would never talk about what happened over there.
Probably 'cause they're still trying to forget about it.
They certainly didn't think of themselves as heroes.
They died without glory.
Nobody has taken their pictures.
Only their buddies knew what they did.
I'd tell their folks they died for their country.
I'm not sure that was it.
Now, there were plenty other photos taken that day, but none anybody wanted to see.
What we see and do in war, the cruelty, is unbelievable.
But somehow we gotta make some sense of it.
To do that, we need a easy to understand truth and damn few words.
Film's ruined.
I don't know.
This one looks all right.
And if you can get a picture...
Now, the right picture can win or lose a war.
You're gonna want to see this.
Look at Vietnam.
The picture of that South Vietnamese officer blowing that fella's brains out of the side of his head, whammo!
That was it.
The war was lost.
We just hung around trying to pretend it wasn't.
Took a lot of other pictures that day.
None of them made a difference.
Thanks.
Appreciate it.
Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.
Country was bankrupt.
People were becoming cynical and tired of war.
Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon!
Where?
Right there.
Planting that flag, that's your brother.
Ma, all you can see is his behind.
And that's his.
I powdered and diapered it, I know my son.
That's him.
Go get your father.
Daddy, Ma's got a picture of Harlon's keister in the paper.
You watch your mouth, young man.
Thank you.
One photo, almost all on its own, turned that around.
It's on the front page of every major paper.
Over 200 dailies and they're all flooded with requests for prints.
I think we might have found it.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- I gotta go get him.
- Oh, no, you don't.
Iggy, I gotta go.
I have a whole different theory.
He wants medical attention bad enough, he'll come to us.
Shut up and crawl over here, you lazy son-of-a-bitch!
As soon as that flare goes out.
- Crap.
Okay, well, I'll go with you.
- No.
You're actually gonna leave me here?
I'll be right back, just shoot some people.
I gotta go.
Oh, God.
Okay, it's okay.
Don't touch them.
Don't touch them.
Get your hands out of there.
Let me do that.
I'll do it, okay?
Don't look.
Keep your head back.
Keep your eyes on me.
All right, look at me.
I'll get it.
I'll take care of it.
We'll get this bandage on you.
We'll get you taken care of.
And we'll get you down to the bottom, all right?
Look, you're gonna be fine.
It's okay.
I'll do that.
I'll do that.
Here, put some pressure on that.
Put your hands on top and put some pressure on it.
Keep your head back.
Keep breathing.
Keep looking at me, all right?
Just keep looking at...
Doc.
Help me.
Help me.
All right.
Okay.
How's that feel?
- It feels good.
- It does?
All right.
- Good.
- All right.
I'm gonna go get a stretcher and get you down to the beach.
I'll be right back.
I'm all right.
Go and help someone who's hurt.
All right.
Hold on there.
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Holy shit.
They expect us to climb this?
Or something just like it.
So, where you think they're sending us?
I think it's the desert, Franklin.
Well, that makes no sense at all.
Well, it's just military psychology.
They always train you for the desert on a volcano.
Now you're just having fun with me.
Harlon, take your men right.
- Watch for Bedouins.
- Yes, sir.
- What's a Bedouin?
- It's a guy with a camel.
Well, Jeez Louise, maybe we are going to the desert.
Now, you tilt that to the right, but what if the bullet comes from the left?
Bullets don't come from the left.
You know any left-handed Japs?
That makes about as much sense as you showering with your shoes on.
You don't even know why you do it, do you?
'Cause I don't tell you mean I don't know?
You do it 'cause Mike does it.
I'll ask him.
So you cut hair back home?
Some.
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?
No, I just studied it a little.
But not in barber school?
Nope.
- Gosh.
- Let me guess, Hayes is winning.
Chief, I had very little to do with Sitting Bull's death, so maybe you could stop taking it out on me.
Different tribe.
The Pimas fought on the side of the white man.
- See, now that's smart.
- That is smart.
Yeah.
Worked real good for us.
Good luck, fellas.
Hey, good night, Lindberg.
Dead bodies.
He cuts hair on dead bodies.
What?
Even I knew that.
- Who's in?
- Oh, I'm in.
I'm in.
It must be a lot easier with them not moving around and all.
- There's that.
- Yeah.
You know what I been thinking?
Well, they been telling us we need to buddy up and I think we'd make pretty good buddies.
And how do you figure that?
Well, you know, in that we have a lot in common.
So, why do you cut dead people's hair, anyway?
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.
You tell a lot of people that?
You actually chose the Marines because they got the best uniform?
No sense being a hero if you don't look like one.
Jacks.
Queens.
Shit.
Do anything on that reservation but play cards, Chief?
All right, listen up, you sorry bunch of leathernecks!
We practice going over the side tomorrow which means we ain't long for this piece of rock.
All right!
One more thing, any man who doesn't have his masturbation papers in order better get them signed by tomorrow night or he ain't going overseas.
- I got mine already.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm square.
Wait.
Why am I just hearing about this?
That's horseshit, Franklin.
I don't have to repeat everything twice for you.
No, I didn't hear nothing about no masturbating papers.
Heard they were running short.
You know, nobody tells me nothing.
That's real nice, guys.
All right, get your ass over to the officer in charge of records.
Maybe he got some more left.
- Leave your smokes.
I'll play for you.
- Thanks, Mike.
Listen, he calls you an idiot, you take it like a man, okay?
Just do not leave without signing them.
- I appreciate it, Sergeant.
- You got it.
What the hell happened to your hair, Rene?
Look like a goddamn corpse.
Three points of contact on that rope at all times.
Next four.
Over the side.
Let's go.
Keep moving.
Next four, over the side.
Just keep your eye on the guy below you.
That's all you gotta look at.
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.
Keep three points of contact on the rope at all times.
You see?
No big thing.
Just one step at a time and keep your hands on the vertical rope.
Remember, once you're in the boat move away from the rope.
Just make sure you keep three points of contact on the rope.
I got him!
All right, get that man out of the water.
Give me a hand.
Grab his pack.
Don't worry about him, Doc.
All right, quit skylarking!
Keep it moving!
He'll be fine.
Our target, Island X, is an ugly, smelly, dirty little scab of rock called Iwo Jima.
It means "Sulfur Island," which accounts for the smell.
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop, you ask me.
After 20 straight days of bombing you won't find a blade of grass or a twig on it.
It wasn't that pretty to start with.
Captain?
Iwo's just five-and-a-half miles long, two-and-a-half wide.
There's a lump down at the bottom.
That's Mount Suribachi.
On the maps in front of you the island is white.
Not much of it.
The black dots represent known enemy emplacements.
Coastal defense guns, dual-mount dual-purpose guns, covered artillery emplacements.
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes, and earth-covered structures.
I don't see any barracks or any other structures.
That's right.
And we still don't know why.
Now, this isn't just any island to them.
This isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, or Saipan.
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders in eight square miles.
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.
It's up to us to convince them.
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.
The 8th Ammo Company will land here to re-supply.
The Suribachi's guns are the biggest problem.
They can hit any point on the island.
We're sitting ducks until we take them out.
That's our job.
We cut across the island, right at the base, slit its throat, lop off its head.
And we take that mountain.
We take that mountain, we take their big guns.
We take their eyes.
Okay, I'm heading in.
Follow me.
Let's put a good show on for the Marines.
Close it up.
Take it right down to the deck.
Yeah, boys!
Man overboard portside!
See him?
Throw me a line!
He's right there.
- Where is he?
- Watch out, watch out, watch out.
Hawaii's that way!
Just keep paddling, Mac, we'll catch you on the way back!
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!
They're not gonna stop.
What?
None of them are.
They can't.
So much for "No man left behind. "
- Sir.
- Come on in.
Look, I've had to make a few other changes.
I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
- You bet.
Trouble is, I already told my men I'd see them through this.
That your James Cagney impersonation?
'Cause I've heard better.
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.
Look, this isn't your first time through this.
- You don't need to prove anything.
- No, sir.
You're not the best sergeant I've ever had, you're just the best one that's still walking.
- Block's a good man.
- Yes, sir, he is.
The men know him, he can step right in.
You know, I have actually thought this through.
Platoon sergeant puts you further away from the bullets.
I already gave them my word, sir.
I told them I'd bring them all home to their mothers which means I already lied to half of them.
Can't lie to the rest.
- How are your men?
- They'll do fine.
Except maybe Gagnon.
Our own Tyrone Power?
Yes, sir.
He's a good man, just might be better use further back from the lines.
I'll use him as a runner.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
Now get out of here.
Hear the good news, Doc?
We're going in with the first waves.
Hey, you do that again I'll take your head off!
Fucking dominoes.
Iggy, have you ever heard news you considered to be bad?
The first ones off the ship, Doc.
Means we don't go over the side of the ship.
We hop on a tractor, they drive us right there.
Oh, shit, that is good news.
You see?
What'd I tell you?
What's going on?
Look at that.
We're killing them!
We're killing them, Doc.
I was promised 10 days of shelling.
You're giving me three and saying that's the best you can do?
I don't give a shit!
My men hit that beach with less than 10 and I'll be taking them home to their mamas in buckets!
Yeah, I know exactly why.
Because every Navy man with a scrambled egg on his chest wants to offload us here and sail to Japan so they can be there for the big finish, tell their kids they captured the Emperor all by themselves.
Well, you aren't going to Japan unless we take this piece of shit island!
These little pricks are dug in!
Okay, appreciate that, Jim.
Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
I'm okay.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
Jesus, Iggy, just leave me alone, all right?
How about you guys?
Knife?
Bayonet?
Kick in the ass?
How about you, Doc?
Sharpen your knife?
You sharpened it three times already.
Well, then I better make sure I didn't nick it.
Good man, Doc.
- Hey, Doc.
- Yeah.
When we land, try not to wave this kit around too much.
They got sharpshooters that are trained to look for them.
And they know that if they take out a corpsman another dozen Marines will die unattended.
All right?
Okay, Mike.
Yeah, right there.
Close the damn door.
For God's sake.
Yeah, like that's gonna help.
That your girlfriend, Chief?
Bet she's a pretty damn good-looking squaw.
Bet you're missing her, and that little wigwam of yours.
Welcome, all Marines off Iwo Jima.
We have a long-time wait...
It's what they do to prisoners,
- at least the lucky ones.
- Jesus.
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think about waving a white bandanna.
Poor Marines, so far from home for no good reason.
Think of your girls back home, waiting for you.
But a girl cannot stay home every night.
So who do you think they're with tonight?
And will she let him kiss her?
And will he comfort her at your funeral?
This sweet music is to make you think of your girls back home who are missing you.
This is all for now.
I'll see you tomorrow night.
Gunners!
Move, let's go!
Let's go, get up on the berm!
Gunners!
We're clear!
Get up the berm!
Baker Company, move out!
- Seen Second Platoon?
- I don't see them.
First Squad, move it out!
God, this place reeks.
- Go, go, go!
- Move out!
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go!
Go!
Go, go!
Drop your packs!
Go!
All clear!
- Jesus, you needed some exercise?
- He got lost.
A hundred landing craft heading for one beach and this guy gets lost.
Now I'm glad we did.
Jesus, what a mess.
Any theories why they ain't shooting?
It's getting on my nerves.
Maybe they're all dead.
What do you think, Doc?
You think they're all dead?
Mike, take six men and bring that gun onto the beach.
Second Platoon, let's move out!
Stay down.
Come on.
Move!
Move!
- Get down!
- Take cover!
Move out!
Cover fire!
Pour it on!
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!
Corpsman!
I'm gonna sling your arm and then I'll give you a shot for the pain!
Move, move!
Off the beach!
Take cover!
You got a girl back home, Marine?
We're gonna make sure she sees you, all right?
I need pressure on this wound!
Where's the fire coming from?
Where are they?
Look for a flash, shoot at it!
Let's go, let...
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!
You're over!
Third Squad, forward!
Move!
Where are they, sir?
We got ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock, pillbox!
Sergeant!
- Sergeant!
I think I can clear that out.
- What?
All right, you go.
Here.
Take these.
Check your weapon.
Yeah?
Go!
Cover!
Cover him!
Cover, cover!
Son-of-a-bitch.
Let's go!
Go!
Move it out!
Go, go, go!
Down, down, down!
It's clear.
Good work.
I thought you said it was clear!
It was!
Shit, I guess they're not in there firing at us then.
Lindberg!
Yeah!
Light it up!
I'll cover you, Ice!
Don't cover shit!
There's already enough people shooting!
One bullet and this thing goes up like a Roman candle!
Go!
Shift fire!
Shift your fire!
Go, go!
Shift your fire!
Shift your fire!
Go!
Move it out!
Hit the deck!
Stay down!
Wait for support!
Is this a bad battle or what?
It's a fucking slaughter.
Christ Jesus!
Get a machine gun team set up over here, now!
Thank God!
Tanks!
Runner!
Get those tanks up here!
Oh, shit.
Get down!
Corporal, watch your left flank!
Let's go without them!
Move out!
Move out!
Iggy, you gotta lift your side, he's gonna roll off.
Got it, Doc!
Incoming!
Move, move, move, move!
Keep moving!
Get that LVT up on the beach!
Keep moving!
You're next, pal, we're getting you out of here.
Move it!
Great news.
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa, 'cause that's where we're headed.
Not you and me.
Captain Severance asked me who else was in that picture, and Christ if I could remember, but it was Mike and Doc and Franklin and me and Hank Hansen but I just remembered, you were there, too.
I wasn't there.
'Course you were.
Neither was Hank.
He raised the first flag.
It was Harlon Block that raised that one.
Shit.
I told them it was Hank.
You weren't there, Mr. Smart Ass, how'd you know it was Harlon?
- You tell them it was me?
- No.
Like I said, I just remembered.
Good, keep your mouth shut.
They know there was somebody else, you can see it in the picture.
Then pick someone dead.
They don't want somebody dead, you dumb redskin, they want to ship us back to the States.
What did I tell you?
I wasn't there.
- You hear?
- All right.
Just settle down.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're not going anywhere.
Who the hell says?
This is horseshit.
You wounded, son?
No, sir.
Well, did you take out a nest of Japs butt-naked with your bare hands?
'Cause if I'm gonna give up my seat to a hero he better have a good goddamn story to tell.
No, sir.
Then enjoy it, 'cause they'll forget you before Christmas.
The sixth man, you got a name?
Sorry, still don't remember.
It's a damn shame, 'cause I promised the Major you'd know who it was.
Fact, you not knowing throws a doubt on you being one of the flag-raisers yourself.
Since no one wants to be embarrassed, the moment you land they'll turn you around, ship you off to Okinawa in time to meet your buddies on the beach.
So, why don't you stop screwing with me?
Give me a damn name.
Gangway!
Gangway!
Let's go, let's go!
Gangway!
Where the hell is that son-of-a-bitch?
Hayes!
Hayes?
Hayes, get your red ass over here!
Make me look like I don't know what my own men are doing with a flag the size of my mother's house?
God damn it, Ira, you shouldn't have lied to me.
You made me look like a complete asshole.
We're gonna miss you around here.
Good luck.
Now your name's in the paper, too.
Just heard your doctor say we're postponing your operation.
You're being shipped back to the mainland.
Everybody who saw that picture thought planting the flag meant victory.
That's all they wanted to know.
Victory.
Within a few weeks of that picture being taken, half the men in it were dead.
Mrs. Hansen!
Mrs. Hansen!
Did you know Hank was a hero?
- Are you proud of him, Mrs. Hansen?
- What was he like as a boy?
Look this way, please, ma'am.
What do you have to say about your son?
But somehow being a part of it meant something.
Looking at it, you could believe their sacrifice was not a waste.
Yeah, I might have thought that was Harlon, too.
It is.
Belle, their names are right here.
It's not him.
And he would be alive and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.
You think about that when you look at his picture, Ed.
And I need to rush home and change because there's the Governor's banquet and then there's the parade.
Imagine, the Governor is coming here to meet us.
Now, I'm wearing blue so, if...
- Are you going to change?
- We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin from CBS World News.
A press association has just announced that President Roosevelt is dead.
The President died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
All we know so far is that the President died at Warm Springs in Georgia.
Further updates every hour.
Temperatures will remain the same today, in the mid-30s to low 40s with clear skies.
Hello?
Yes.
Of course.
No, we understand.
It wouldn't be right.
Thank you.
Here he is, gentlemen.
Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.
Senator Haddigan.
I'd like you to meet Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Damn good to meet you.
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.
Sorry?
That's Pima Indian talk, boy, don't you know your own language?
Took forever to memorize the damn gibberish.
Sorry, I've been away from the reservation too long, Senator.
- Doc.
- Ira.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
- That's you.
- Go, go, go, go.
Go.
Please welcome
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley,
Private First Class Ira Hayes,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon!
Holy shit.
Come in, come in, come in.
Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Bud Gurber.
- You showing the boys the sights?
- We saw a hell of a ball game.
That's great.
The bar's there, help yourself.
I got some briefing sheets for you here, just some simple things we want you to say.
Mostly, "Buy bonds," can't say that too often.
Itineraries, those are changing every couple minutes.
Everybody wants to meet you guys.
I got women sending up envelopes with stockings in them, notes written in lipstick.
We won't mention that to the press, am I right?
Have a drink, for Christ's sake.
My God, what you boys must have seen over there.
I've been watching the newsreels.
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.
So, we got a hell of a lot of money to raise, not a lot of time.
White House tomorrow, then we trot you over to shake hands with a couple of hundred Congressmen who won't pull a penny out of their pockets.
Politicians and actors.
You put them in a restaurant together, they'd die of old age before picking up the check.
Then New York City, Times Square, dinners with various hoi polloi, then Chicago...
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?
That's what we're calling the mothers of the dead flag-raisers.
You present each mother with a flag, they say a few words, people will shit money.
It'll be so moving.
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.
Lovely woman.
She knows how close you and her son were.
He wrote home about you.
She is very, very much looking forward to meeting you.
Hank wasn't in the picture.
Sorry?
Hank didn't raise that flag.
He raised the other one, the real flag.
The what?
The real...
The real flag?
There's a real flag?
Yeah, ours was the replacement flag.
We put it up when they took the other one down.
Am I the only one getting a headache here?
You know about this?
It was after it was already in the papers.
The mothers had already been told, but...
That's it, that's beautiful.
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Yeah, why tell me?
I'm only the guy that has to explain it to 150 million Americans.
Who is in the goddamn picture?
Are any of you guys in the goddamn picture?
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.
Six guys raising a flag over Iwo Jima.
Victory is ours.
You're three of them, right?
This was the fifth day, sir.
The battle went on for 35 more.
Well, what'd you do, raise a goddamn flag every time you stopped for lunch?
Can I hit this guy?
You know what, I don't give a shit, you're in the picture, you raised the flag, that's the story we're selling, boys.
Are you deaf?
Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?
Harlon Block.
That's whose mother should be here if anyone's should be.
You know, I think this whole damn thing is a farce, you ask me.
You know what they're calling this bond drive?
The Mighty Seventh.
They might've called it the
"We're Flat Fucking Broke And Can't Even Afford Bullets
"So We're Begging For Your Pennies" bond drive, but it didn't have quite the ring.
They could've called it that, though, because the last four bond drives came up so short we just printed money instead.
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street, he'll tell you our dollar is next to worthless, we borrowed so much.
And nobody is lending any more.
Ships aren't being built.
Tanks aren't being built.
Machine guns, bazookas, hand grenades, zip.
You think this is a farce?
You want to go back to your buddies?
Well, stuff some rocks in your pockets before you get on the plane because that's all we got left to throw at the Japanese.
And don't be surprised if your plane doesn't make it off the runway because the fuel dumps are empty.
And our good friends, the Arabs, are only taking bullion.
If we don't raise $14 billion, and that's million with a "B," this war is over by the end of the month.
We make a deal with the Japanese, we give whatever they want and we come home, because you've seen them fight, and they sure as shit ain't giving up.
$14 billion.
The last three drives didn't make that much all together.
People on the street corners, they looked at this picture and they took hope.
Don't ask me why, I think it's a crappy picture myself.
You can't even see your faces.
But it said we can win this war, are winning this war, we just need you to dig a little deeper.
They want to give us that money.
No, they want to give it to you.
But you, you don't want to ask for it.
You don't want to give them hope.
You want to explain about this person and that flag.
Well, that's your choice.
Because if we admit we made a mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about and that will be that.
Gentlemen.
Mr. President, here they are.
- Well, hello.
Good to see you.
- Mr. President.
Darn good to see you, boys.
Heard you had a hell of a fight on your hands out there, hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation in Arizona, am I right?
Yes, Mr. President.
Being an Indian, you are a truer American than any of us.
Bet your people are proud to see you wear that uniform.
Very proud, sir.
They should be.
Well, I want to thank you for coming all this way to Washington to help us out.
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific now we need you to fight for a mountain of cash.
- And I don't expect you'll let us down.
- No, sir.
Good.
Go get it.
That's the end of this ceremony.
Let's take a look at this famous photo over here, see if I can pick you out.
My gosh.
There you are.
Boys.
Boys, this one's on me.
To those who can't be with us.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon.
May we have your autograph?
I suppose.
And your name is?
I don't know about you, but I get the impression
I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.
You're such a hero.
I feel honored to be in your presence.
That's just not true.
That's professional work.
Here, to professionals.
Here they are.
You're the guys in the photograph, right?
I heard you were on the train.
Let me shake your hands, John Tennack.
John Bradley.
These boys are with me, Harvard and Yale types, didn't fight a lick.
Pappies all rich sons-of-bitches.
Boys, shake hands with some real war heroes.
Excuse me for one moment.
You can buy them a drink while you're at it.
That's right.
Drinks for these men all the way around.
And you're the other one, aren't you?
John Tennack, Tennack Homes.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Pleased to meet you.
Have a drink, come on.
And here's my card.
Listen to me, Rene, when you get finished being famous you come see me because if you can sell bonds, you can sell homes.
Now, they're not gonna build homes anymore, they're gonna deliver them.
- You heard of prefab homes?
- No, sir.
Well, you will.
And you hang on to that card and you come see me, you hear?
- All right?
- Certainly will.
All right.
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?
If Mike and the guys could see us.
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it, would they?
Harlon!
Franklin!
Can you imagine Franklin on this train
eating at the dining car with all the silver?
We shouldn't be here, Doc.
There's gonna be a Hallelujah Day
When the boys have all come home to stay
And a million bands begin to play
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
And when we've lit the torch of liberty
In each blacked-out land across the sea
Ira!
Hey, Ira!
We heard the picture was posed!
What?
We heard you posed the picture!
Hey, Doc!
We're bigger than life, Doc!
And we'll heave a mighty sigh
When each gal can kiss the boy she kissed goodbye
And they'll come marching down Fifth Avenue
The United Nations in review
When this lovely dream has all come true
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
Good job.
Thank you.
Thank you, girls!
And now, here are the men you've been waiting to meet, the men in white.
Right behind me here, the heroes of Iwo Jima,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon,
Private First Class Ira Hayes, and Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley!
Thank you.
It's good of you people to come out tonight in support of the war effort.
We really need you to buy bonds, that's for sure.
'Cause we can't win the war without your help.
As far as us being the heroes of Iwo Jima, that's just not the case.
We really didn't do much at all.
Especially him.
Especially me.
I was just a runner.
That's it.
We put up a flag.
The pole we attached it to was heavy, so it took a number of us.
We had our picture taken doing it.
The real heroes are dead on that island.
And we'd appreciate it if you bought bonds in honor of them.
Thank you.
Jump on any grenades, Ira?
Take out any machine gun nests I missed?
At least I fired my weapon.
All right, knock it off.
You hit anything or were you too drunk then, too?
What?
Guys!
Come on!
Stop it.
Knock it off.
The tall man with the high hat will be coming down your way
Get your savings out when you hear him shout
"Any bonds today?"
Any bonds today?
Bonds of freedom that's what I'm selling
Any bonds today?
Rene, right here.
Sit between these two boys.
Here comes the freedom man
Asking you to buy a share of freedom today ...for us and they need our help.
And, if you think about it, I think you'll realize that buying more bonds is not just the right thing to do but the only thing to do.
Yes, this war has gone on too long.
We have given too many lives.
And its cost...
- Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
- Strawberry.
...has been far too high.
But if we waver now, if we don't dig deep and give more than we think we can then those sacrifices would be wasted...
Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
...and those lives lost in vain.
Let's move!
Go, go!
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over.
Where the hell are our tanks?
Stuck in the sand.
Captain says you're to go without them.
Christ.
That's real good work you're doing there, Rene.
All right, prepare to move out.
Pass the word.
Second Platoon!
Move!
Move!
Move!
All right, Second Platoon, on your feet!
Let's move out!
Jackass.
Let's move out!
Go, go!
Move, move, move!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Second Platoon, move out!
Doc!
Doc, get out of there!
Corpsman!
Doc!
Doc, get the hell out of there!
May I have your attention, please.
Train number 48 with service from New York City, Boston,
Rochester, New York,
Toledo, Ohio, and South Bend, Indiana is now arriving on Track 7.
Train number 48 now arriving on Track number 7.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.
- Come on, boys.
- Let's go.
- Watch your step, ma'am.
- Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the heroes of Iwo Jima.
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.
Private First Class Ira Hayes.
And Private First Class Rene Gagnon.
Rene!
That's my boyfriend!
Who the hell is that?
I don't know.
- Rene, is that your girl?
- Hey, what do they call you?
How about a photo?
Hey, look at that!
What's your name, doll?
What's your name?
Hey, she's a beauty.
Let's go find a saloon.
Smile, boys.
Give them their money's worth.
Hey, Doc, how's the tour going for you?
Thank you.
Where exactly are you staying?
- I'm not sure yet.
- Just forget about that.
Senator, I'd like you to meet Corpsman John Bradley.
- Doc, right?
- Yes, sir.
Nice to meet you, Senator.
Good to meet you, young man.
Now, we appreciate everything you've done and everything you're doing.
- Thank you, sir.
- Quite all right.
This is Captain White.
- Colonel Johns.
- We're proud of you, Corpsman.
And then Colonel McCourtney.
- Major General Green.
- Nice to meet you.
Senator, this is Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Of course!
Now I hear you used a tomahawk on those Japs.
Is that true, Chief?
No, sir.
Well, tell them you did, makes a better story, huh?
- Attaboy.
- This is Captain Green.
John?
Madeline Evelley.
I recognize you from all the photographs.
I'm Hank's mom.
It's so nice to meet you, ma'am.
Hank was always talking about you.
This is PFC Rene Gagnon.
Pleasure to meet you, son.
Thanks for everything.
- My pleasure.
- Not at all.
Ira, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Strank, Mike's mom.
It's all right.
When I got the telegram, I...
I don't know what I'm trying to say here.
Knowing he was with you that day and seeing him in that photograph,
I don't know why it makes me feel better, but it does.
- It's so silly, isn't it?
- No, it's not.
How are you, son?
Thank you very much.
We're the largest furniture wholesaler in Illinois.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
- I'll make sure he calls.
- Well, thank you.
Thank you.
Are you Rene?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Franklin's mother.
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.
I'm Pauline, Rene's girlfriend.
Would you mind?
Paper said that's Hank, and I honestly can't tell.
It's horrible of a mother not to know her own son, isn't it?
But that's him, isn't it?
Well, to be honest, ma'am, it happened so quick, and with everything that was going on it's kind of hard to remember who was where.
But...
Yeah, I think...
I think that's where he was.
That's Hank.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Excuse us.
Take him outside.
I'm Pauline.
- Very nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
He was the best Marine I ever knew.
Thank you.
- You okay, Chief?
- Oh, Christ!
I'm okay.
Yeah, you look it.
You're gonna screw this up, aren't you?
You're gonna screw it up for all of us.
I've got him.
Get some sleep, Ira.
- Mike?
- Yeah?
- You see this?
- What?
- Mike!
- Oh, shit, go!
He's killing me!
Hey, Doc, you think they got them all?
What?
Well, they're not shooting at us.
Maybe we killed them all.
Or they ran off in the night or something.
Or they're waiting for us to start climbing.
Third Platoon!
Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.
- Just us?
- Yeah, just us, Igg.
All right, Third Platoon, move!
I tag along?
Yeah, you can lead the way if you want.
Get a good shot of my face.
It's your ass I'm gonna make famous, Hank.
Hey, that'll work for me, too.
Lieutenant, if you make it to the top, put this up.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, Iggy.
They never shoot at the first patrol.
- They don't?
- No.
They want us to go up to the top, signal to the others that it's okay, then shoot everybody else as they come up the mountain.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Unless of course they want to make an example of us and discourage all the others.
I think you're full of crap, you know that, Hank?
Really?
Jesus.
Thank God that ain't us.
Told you.
Boots, spread them out and put them on a line.
Set up a perimeter!
First Squad!
- Hank?
Find me a pole.
- Yeah.
Let's put this flag up.
Watch it.
Right over here.
Right here.
That's good.
That's good.
Right here, right here.
Got that end?
Hold that steady.
Lindberg.
- Hey, who's got rope?
- Right here.
Give me something.
Yeah, good.
That work?
Do it, fellas.
Keep it coming.
USMC!
USMC!
Shit, look at that!
Jeez, look at that.
Get down!
Take cover!
Cover with that.30!
- Watch it!
Twenty yards down, Hank!
- You see them?
- I got about 20 yards, left side.
- Lindberg, get the flamethrower!
- Boots, you see them?
- Cover right!
- About 20 yards down!
Duck one!
- You see them?
Keep the cover on!
Second Squad, you see them?
Get me some grenades!
I see them!
You see them?
Right flank, over to the right!
Cover me, I'm going down!
Careful, Iggy.
Easy.
All clear!
Okay, guys, who wants to be famous?
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
- God damn it.
Strank!
- Sir?
They want a phone line run up to the top of the mountain.
Let me guess, they picked us.
Second Platoon, let's go.
Get some exercise.
Let's go!
Get off your ass.
Oh, shit!
Hope it still works, 'cause you're not getting mine!
- Get Forrestal!
- All right, then.
I don't know whose idea it was, Mr. Secretary.
Well, it was goddamn brilliant.
I want that flag, Holland.
Mark my words, raising that son-of-a-bitch means a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.
I want that flag.
Yes, sir.
I'll make sure no one touches it.
You can count on me.
Fuck that.
That flag belongs to the men in this battalion.
That son-of-a-bitch thinks that our men died taking this ground so we could hand over our flag to some politician to pin to his wall?
He's out of his goddamn mind!
Get me that flag, and find another one to replace it.
You've gotta be shitting me.
Gagnon!
Get your ass over here.
Hey.
Hi, fellas.
How's it going?
Missed a beautiful shot, Joe.
It's that kind of day.
- Hey, Mike.
- Hell of a view, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant!
Captain says he wants that flag.
He wants this flag?
Yes, sir.
- We just put the damn thing up.
- Yes, sir.
Some kind of flag shortage?
He wants you to put this one up instead.
Hey, Mike.
Do me a favor and put this up, will you?
Yes, sir.
All right, let's find a pole.
Take the flag down, boys.
Captain's orders.
You heard him, let's do it.
There you go.
Lordy, she's a heavy one.
All right, hang on.
Put this on.
One hell of a view, huh?
Good view from up here.
Yes, I'd say so myself.
All right.
- Not in your way here, am I, Joe?
- Nah, I'm fine, thanks.
Hey, Doc, you wanna give us a hand here?
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.
Ready?
Ready?
Let's go.
You get it?
I don't know.
I wish I could've seen their faces.
Nobody even noticed that second flag going up.
Everybody saw that damn picture and made up their own story about it.
But your dad and the others knew what they had done and what they had not done.
All your friends dying, it's hard not to be called a hero for saving somebody's life.
But for putting up a pole?
You gotta be kidding.
Hey!
It took a lot of talented folks a long time to make that thing.
Just wait till tonight when it's lit properly and there's thousands of cheering people in the stands.
It's gonna look a lot better.
So, stadium lights come down, spotlight comes up and you get your cue.
You charge up this thing with the flag, you plant it at the top.
You smile, you wave.
You know the drill.
You want us to plant the flag on a pile of papier-mâché.
Hey, that's show biz.
And try and stand how you stood the first time you planted it.
Just, you know, pretend the other three guys are with you.
The dead guys.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, not a problem.
Good.
But where do we imagine Hank is standing?
Sorry?
Well, seeing that he wasn't there, it'll be kind of hard for us to leave a space for him.
I think you know exactly where he was.
You pointed him out to his mother.
This is bullshit.
I planted that damn thing once, and I'm not doing it again.
- Hayes!
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
Hayes.
Hayes, get your ass back here or you're going on report.
Hayes!
You wanna do your damn job?
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Come on!
He's with me!
Hey, he's with me!
- Back off!
- Sir, he's with me.
Okay?
He's with me.
Ira, put the goddamn chair down!
- Put the chair down, son!
- Put the chair down, Ira!
Tell them drop their sticks!
Ira, they're cops, they're supposed to have nightsticks.
You're not supposed to be in the street swinging a chair.
- Calm down, son.
- Sir, turn around, please.
That poster right there?
The one on the end, that's him.
- That's him?
- Yes, sir.
You read the papers?
Christ.
We got another fucking hero.
Get him out of here.
- Can you do that?
- Yes, sir.
Put the goddamn chair down.
And let's go.
Did you start this?
He didn't serve me!
I don't make the rules.
We don't serve Indians.
He needs to go sleep it off.
Soldier Field.
You hear that?
What the hell is that?
I can't figure it out.
Keep an eye out.
It sounds like it's coming from up there.
They're using grenades.
They're killing themselves.
Ira, let's go.
Come on.
Let's go, Ira.
Come on.
Thank God.
Jesus.
Look at you, Chief.
You found him.
Holy shit.
You would have to pick today.
Vandegrift is here with enough brass to start a fucking band.
Come on, let's go.
Can you walk?
- Yes, sir.
- By yourself?
All right, look.
I don't care if you have to carry him get him to the top, plant that flag, and don't fucking fall off.
Get him in his stuff.
I'll stall these guys for as long as I can.
Hurry up.
Jesus Christ.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Cover!
Harlon!
Harlon!
Get your fire team up in that position!
O'Hare!
First Fire Team!
Work around!
BAR, you, on the side of the ridge!
Covering fire, boys, go, go, go!
Jackson, work your team around to the left!
Cover!
Left flank!
Left flank!
Franklin, Gust, go check it out!
Hustle up, boys!
We got them!
Clear!
One hell of an experience.
Move out!
Cease fire!
They're my men!
You're targeting our men!
You're targeting our...
Get me another radio!
Sergeant?
Sergeant!
Mike!
Mike, Mike, Mike.
Mike?
Mike.
Hey, where's Doc?
Corpsman!
Oh, shit.
How's his breathing?
Harlon, move, buddy.
Hey, Mike.
Mike, Mike, can you hear us?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on, Mike.
Mike?
Mike, can you hear us?
All right, let's go!
Move out!
I'm gonna get a stretcher.
Let's take him down, move him off the beach.
Ladies and gentlemen, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Corpsman!
Hank!
Hank!
Doc, they killed me.
Harlon!
Doc, they killed me.
Come on, Harlon.
Harlon, stay with me.
Franklin!
I'm fine, Ira.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Does it open?
Iggy!
Iggy!
Iggy, are you down there?
Iggy!
Can't tell who it is, but he's one of ours.
I had to go outside to throw up.
Look what they did to the poor son-of-a-bitch.
You okay, Chief?
Just let it go.
If that doesn't pry open their wallets, nothing will.
Jesus Christ, he's drunk.
Goddamn Indians.
Come on, Chief.
Let's get you home.
That's not what I hear.
I called around, I'm not stupid.
He's been drunk since he started this damn tour, making a spectacle of himself.
Just about choked that poor woman at the reception, blubbering.
Jesus Christ, you're supposed to be watching these men.
Yes, sir.
Well, he's making us look like regular asses.
Well, with all due respect, sir, he never wanted to come on this trip in the first place.
We had to pull him, kicking and screaming, off that boat.
He wants to be with his unit.
What unit?
They're all fucking dead.
This is how he honors those men?
By drinking and throwing up, and...
You know what?
He wants it, great, we'll send him back.
Get him packed and on a train today.
He's an embarrassment to the uniform.
Yes, sir.
I'll do it.
Yeah, no, that's...
That's good.
That's what I want.
I know it's a good thing, raising the money and that, 'cause we need it.
But,
I can't take them calling me a hero.
All I did was try not to get shot.
Some of the things I saw done, things I did,
they weren't things to be proud of, you know?
Mike...
Mike was a hero.
You ever meet him?
No.
Best Marine I ever met.
You know, Chief, I think if Mike was sitting here instead of you he'd be saying the same thing about himself,
not being a hero.
Maybe.
He was a good guy.
But I think that he would be ashamed of me, seeing me the way I am.
Think I could see my ma before they ship me off?
Think they'd do that?
See my ma?
I'm sorry, Ira.
We got stories now to tell our kids, I guess.
Keep your head down.
All aboard.
Good luck, Chief.
I think I saw him once after that.
It was maybe six or seven years after the war.
I was working as a salesman, doing a lot of driving.
I was driving west across Texas.
I was just trying to get where I was going so I could get home.
And I saw this guy hitchhiking on the side of the road.
And, for a second, I thought it might've been him.
I always regret that I didn't stop, but I was in a hurry.
And he was an Indian.
We always told the press that Ira insisted that he was going back to fight with his unit which was at least partially true, but
that isn't what got the headlines.
We're engaged.
Excuse me a minute, darling.
- Hey, Doc?
- Yeah?
- Got a minute?
- Yeah.
I'll see you at the car.
- You hear I'm getting married?
- I did, Rene.
That's great.
Yeah, it's something she wants.
She waited for me all this time.
She's not used to all this, but she's a good girl.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
So, I was wondering if you'd be my best man.
Me?
Don't you have somebody at home, a buddy, you'd rather ask?
Well, I didn't really make many.
The ones who didn't go, it's...
Well, it's hard to even talk to them.
You know?
Yeah, I know.
I'd be proud to.
Thank you.
I better go drag her away from them before she announces
I'm gonna be president of General Motors or something.
All right.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Rene, you're a lucky man.
- Big smile, Mrs. Gagnon!
- Say cheese!
I couldn't complain because the press loved them, so they wrote more articles and people bought more bonds.
The tour went on with just Rene and your dad.
And the true heroes are the men who didn't make it home from Iwo Jima, the men who died at Iwo Jima and in other campaigns.
We ask that you honor the memory of those men by buying the war bonds and helping us to win this war.
Thank you.
City after city, I thought the damn thing'd never end.
And this rumor kept going around that the photograph had been staged.
I remember your dad telling them that he wished he'd known he was having his picture taken because he would've ducked the hell out of it.
Whose idea was it?
Who wanted to stage the thing?
Come on, it was you?
Was there truth to the rumor that that picture was staged, Doc?
- Come on!
Doc?
- Can you answer that?
I remember when your dad got shot.
All hell was busting loose.
People back home saw that picture and thought it was over when we took Suribachi.
We wished.
Anyways, we're pinned down.
Mortars, shells, machine guns.
Fire coming from every which direction, right?
And we hear somebody call, "Corpsman down. "
Corpsman down!
Blood was spurting out of his throat, and Doc was doing everything he could.
And the Corpsman looks up at him and he knows what this means, to be shot in the neck.
He knows he's dying, you can see that.
But still in his eyes, he's pleading with Doc to save his life.
And Doc can't.
- You okay, Doc?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah, you look fine.
- I'm okay.
Keep down, all right?
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.
Okay.
Corpsman.
Corpsman!
For God sake, Corpsman!
Corpsman?
Corpsman.
Incoming!
Let me see.
It's not that bad.
You're gonna be okay.
All right?
Just stay with me.
Look at me.
Took us a half-hour to find your dad.
He could've bled to death.
Coming down.
Thanks.
Vets'll tell you about being hit but not wanting to leave their buddies.
Usually, they're lying.
You'll take any excuse to get out of there.
But it happens.
You get the feeling you're letting them down.
I could see that in your dad's face.
He wanted to go, he'd seen enough.
But he didn't want to leave us.
Now, he was a hell of a good man, your dad.
Yeah.
While we were sitting there on the beach, we heard this great roar.
And we looked up.
That was the first of thousands of landings on Iwo.
- Look at that.
- Yeah.
How about that.
I'm gonna head back, all right?
Good luck.
That island saved a lot of lives.
A lot of lives.
I don't know what else to tell you.
After the bond tour my dad finally got his operation.
By the time he got home the war was over.
First thing he did was ask my mom to marry him.
Ira tried to get on with his life and put it all behind him.
Thank you for having me here today.
It's an honor to be in front of such a strong people.
Because of the war white men will understand Indians a lot better.
And it's going to be a better world.
But life had other plans for him.
You're...
You're him, aren't you?
You're the hero, right?
Great.
All right, kids, go get your picture taken.
Oh, that's great.
That's great.
All right, now say cheese.
Cheese!
That's great!
Okay.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Thanks.
- Come on.
- That's a hero, kids.
Hero, lift this basket, will you?
It's too heavy for me.
Rene tried to take advantage of those offers he'd received on the bond tour.
Yes.
G-A-G-N-O-N.
Right.
Pronounced Rene.
Rene, yes.
- Okay, I actually called last week.
- Yes.
Okay, yes.
Mr. Gagnon.
I gave Mr. Tennack your message.
I'm sure he'll call you.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
But he was yesterday's hero.
He even applied for a job at the local police station.
They said he wasn't qualified.
After working the factory with Pauline he tried a few things but spent the rest of his life as a janitor.
But Ira...
Ira!
You got a visitor.
Ira always made the news.
I could never find out why he did it, but one day Ira just took off.
He walked and hitched over 1,300 miles from Arizona to Texas.
He found Harlon Block's father working his field.
His wife, Belle, had left him soon after they discovered Harlon died.
She never forgave him for letting her son go off to war.
And Ira told him the truth, that it had been his son who raised the flag with them, his son in the photograph.
And then he just turned and walked away.
Though the flag-raising meant nothing to him, he somehow knew it would mean everything to them.
Thanks for calling.
Just as Belle knew all along.
The press soon found out and called Hank's mom with the news that it wasn't her son after all.
The last time they all saw each other was at the unveiling of the Marine Corps War Memorial.
And even though he planted the first flag above Iwo Jima,
Hank's mother and father weren't invited.
Ira.
It's good to see you, Ira.
Hell of a statue.
It wasn't long after that that they found Ira.
The papers said he died of exposure.
There was no autopsy.
It was about that same time when my father got in his car early one morning telling my mom he had something to do.
He drove to a town on the other side of Wisconsin where Iggy's mom lived.
Ever since she heard the news about her son she'd been trying to find out how he died, and no one would tell her.
I never found out what he told her, but I can pretty much guarantee it wasn't the truth.
My mother would ask him what was troubling him.
He would never say.
And every year, as it got close to Memorial Day, the reporters would start calling asking to interview my father.
No, I'm sorry.
He's fishing in Canada.
We were always instructed to say the same thing.
Okay.
Thanks.
When Mr. McCandless retired, my father bought the funeral home where he'd worked since coming home.
He spent the rest of his life running the business and raising his family.
He never spoke about the war or about the flag-raising, never told us anything.
The first time I heard any of these stories was after he died.
Where is he?
Oh, God.
He's not here, Dad.
He died.
Who?
Who died?
Iggy.
Iggy.
Christ, poor Iggy.
I hadn't thought of him for years.
How do you know about Iggy?
You were calling for him, when you collapsed.
I wasn't looking for Iggy.
I was looking for you.
I wanted to...
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry I wasn't a better father.
Talked to you more.
I just...
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
You were the best father a man could have.
Did I ever tell you they took us swimming?
No, Dad.
After we planted the flag, we came down off the mountain and they let us swim.
It was the funniest thing.
All this fighting and we were jumping around in the water like kids.
That's the way I remember Iggy now.
I finally came to the conclusion that maybe he was right.
Maybe there's no such thing as heroes.
Maybe there are just people like my dad.
I finally came to understand why they were so uncomfortable being called heroes.
Heroes are something we create, something we need.
It's a way for us to understand what is almost incomprehensible, how people could sacrifice so much for us.
But for my dad and these men, the risks they took, the wounds they suffered, they did that for their buddies.
They may have fought for their country, but they died for their friends.
For the man in front, for the man beside them.
And if we wish to truly honor these men, we should remember them the way they really were, the way my dad remembered them.
Come on, Doc!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
For God sakes!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Honey, what's wrong?
Every jackass thinks he knows what war is.
Especially those who've never been in one.
We like things nice and simple, good and evil, heroes and villains.
There's always plenty of both.
Most of the time, they are not who we think they are.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where...
Where is he?
Where is he?
Mr. Bradley?
Mr. B?
You okay?
- Where is he?
- Where is who?
Where is he?
Where did he go?
Where...
Where is he?
All right.
Just stay right here, okay?
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
It'll be okay.
Where is he?
Most guys I knew would never talk about what happened over there.
Probably 'cause they're still trying to forget about it.
They certainly didn't think of themselves as heroes.
They died without glory.
Nobody has taken their pictures.
Only their buddies knew what they did.
I'd tell their folks they died for their country.
I'm not sure that was it.
Now, there were plenty other photos taken that day, but none anybody wanted to see.
What we see and do in war, the cruelty, is unbelievable.
But somehow we gotta make some sense of it.
To do that, we need a easy to understand truth and damn few words.
Film's ruined.
I don't know.
This one looks all right.
And if you can get a picture...
Now, the right picture can win or lose a war.
You're gonna want to see this.
Look at Vietnam.
The picture of that South Vietnamese officer blowing that fella's brains out of the side of his head, whammo!
That was it.
The war was lost.
We just hung around trying to pretend it wasn't.
Took a lot of other pictures that day.
None of them made a difference.
Thanks.
Appreciate it.
Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.
Country was bankrupt.
People were becoming cynical and tired of war.
Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon!
Where?
Right there.
Planting that flag, that's your brother.
Ma, all you can see is his behind.
And that's his.
I powdered and diapered it, I know my son.
That's him.
Go get your father.
Daddy, Ma's got a picture of Harlon's keister in the paper.
You watch your mouth, young man.
Thank you.
One photo, almost all on its own, turned that around.
It's on the front page of every major paper.
Over 200 dailies and they're all flooded with requests for prints.
I think we might have found it.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- I gotta go get him.
- Oh, no, you don't.
Iggy, I gotta go.
I have a whole different theory.
He wants medical attention bad enough, he'll come to us.
Shut up and crawl over here, you lazy son- of- a- bitch!
As soon as that flare goes out.
- Crap.
Okay, well, I'll go with you.
- No.
You're actually gonna leave me here?
I'll be right back, just shoot some people.
I gotta go.
Oh, God.
Okay, it's okay.
Don't touch them.
Don't touch them.
Get your hands out of there.
Let me do that.
I'll do it, okay?
Don't look.
Keep your head back.
Keep your eyes on me.
All right, look at me.
I'll get it.
I'll take care of it.
We'll get this bandage on you.
We'll get you taken care of.
And we'll get you down to the bottom, all right?
Look, you're gonna be fine.
It's okay.
I'll do that.
I'll do that.
Here, put some pressure on that.
Put your hands on top and put some pressure on it.
Keep your head back.
Keep breathing.
Keep looking at me, all right?
Just keep looking at...
Doc.
Help me.
Help me.
All right.
Okay.
How's that feel?
- It feels good.
- It does?
All right.
- Good.
- All right.
I'm gonna go get a stretcher and get you down to the beach.
I'll be right back.
I'm all right.
Go and help someone who's hurt.
All right.
Hold on there.
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Holy shit.
They expect us to climb this?
Or something just like it.
So, where you think they're sending us?
I think it's the desert, Franklin.
Well, that makes no sense at all.
Well, it's just military psychology.
They always train you for the desert on a volcano.
Now you're just having fun with me.
Harlon, take your men right.
- Watch for Bedouins.
- Yes, sir.
- What's a Bedouin?
- It's a guy with a camel.
Well, Jeez Louise, maybe we are going to the desert.
Now, you tilt that to the right, but what if the bullet comes from the left?
Bullets don't come from the left.
You know any left- handed Japs?
That makes about as much sense as you showering with your shoes on.
You don't even know why you do it, do you?
'Cause I don't tell you mean I don't know?
You do it 'cause Mike does it.
I'll ask him.
So you cut hair back home?
Some.
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?
No, I just studied it a little.
But not in barber school?
Nope.
- Gosh.
- Let me guess, Hayes is winning.
Chief, I had very little to do with Sitting Bull's death, so maybe you could stop taking it out on me.
Different tribe.
The Pimas fought on the side of the white man.
- See, now that's smart.
- That is smart.
Yeah.
Worked real good for us.
Good luck, fellas.
Hey, good night, Lindberg.
Dead bodies.
He cuts hair on dead bodies.
What?
Even I knew that.
- Who's in?
- Oh, I'm in.
I'm in.
It must be a lot easier with them not moving around and all.
- There's that.
- Yeah.
You know what I been thinking?
Well, they been telling us we need to buddy up and I think we'd make pretty good buddies.
And how do you figure that?
Well, you know, in that we have a lot in common.
So, why do you cut dead people's hair, anyway?
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.
You tell a lot of people that?
You actually chose the Marines because they got the best uniform?
No sense being a hero if you don't look like one.
Jacks.
Queens.
Shit.
Do anything on that reservation but play cards, Chief?
All right, listen up, you sorry bunch of leathernecks!
We practice going over the side tomorrow which means we ain't long for this piece of rock.
All right!
One more thing, any man who doesn't have his masturbation papers in order better get them signed by tomorrow night or he ain't going overseas.
- I got mine already.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm square.
Wait.
Why am I just hearing about this?
That's horseshit, Franklin.
I don't have to repeat everything twice for you.
No, I didn't hear nothing about no masturbating papers.
Heard they were running short.
You know, nobody tells me nothing.
That's real nice, guys.
All right, get your ass over to the officer in charge of records.
Maybe he got some more left.
- Leave your smokes.
I'll play for you.
- Thanks, Mike.
Listen, he calls you an idiot, you take it like a man, okay?
Just do not leave without signing them.
- I appreciate it, Sergeant.
- You got it.
What the hell happened to your hair, Rene?
Look like a goddamn corpse.
Three points of contact on that rope at all times.
Next four.
Over the side.
Let's go.
Keep moving.
Next four, over the side.
Just keep your eye on the guy below you.
That's all you gotta look at.
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.
Keep three points of contact on the rope at all times.
You see?
No big thing.
Just one step at a time and keep your hands on the vertical rope.
Remember, once you're in the boat move away from the rope.
Just make sure you keep three points of contact on the rope.
I got him!
All right, get that man out of the water.
Give me a hand.
Grab his pack.
Don't worry about him, Doc.
All right, quit skylarking!
Keep it moving!
He'll be fine.
Our target, Island X, is an ugly, smelly, dirty little scab of rock called lwo Jima.
It means "Sulfur Island," which accounts for the smell.
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop, you ask me.
After 20 straight days of bombing you won't find a blade of grass or a twig on it.
It wasn't that pretty to start with.
Captain?
Iwo's just five-and-a-half miles long, two-and-a-half wide.
There's a lump down at the bottom.
That's Mount Suribachi.
On the maps in front of you the island is white.
Not much of it.
The black dots represent known enemy emplacements.
Coastal defense guns, dual-mount dual-purpose guns, covered artillery emplacements.
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes, and earth- covered structures.
I don't see any barracks or any other structures.
That's right.
And we still don't know why.
Now, this isn't just any island to them.
This isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, or Saipan.
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders in eight square miles.
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.
It's up to us to convince them.
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.
The 8th Ammo Company will land here to re- supply.
The Suribachi's guns are the biggest problem.
They can hit any point on the island.
We're sitting ducks until we take them out.
That's our job.
We cut across the island, right at the base, slit its throat, lop off its head.
And we take that mountain.
We take that mountain, we take their big guns.
We take their eyes.
Okay, I'm heading in.
Follow me.
Let's put a good show on for the Marines.
Close it up.
Take it right down to the deck.
Yeah, boys!
Man overboard portside!
See him?
Throw me a line!
He's right there.
- Where is he?
- Watch out, watch out, watch out.
Hawaii's that way!
Just keep paddling, Mac, we'll catch you on the way back!
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!
They're not gonna stop.
What?
None of them are.
They can't.
So much for "No man left behind."
- Sir.
- Come on in.
Look, I've had to make a few other changes.
I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
- You bet.
Trouble is, I already told my men I'd see them through this.
That your James Cagney impersonation?
'Cause I've heard better.
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.
Look, this isn't your first time through this.
- You don't need to prove anything.
- No, sir.
You're not the best sergeant I've ever had, you're just the best one that's still walking.
- Block's a good man.
- Yes, sir, he is.
The men know him, he can step right in.
You know, I have actually thought this through.
Platoon sergeant puts you further away from the bullets.
I already gave them my word, sir.
I told them I'd bring them all home to their mothers which means I already lied to half of them.
Can't lie to the rest.
- How are your men?
- They'll do fine.
Except maybe Gagnon.
Our own Tyrone Power?
Yes, sir.
He's a good man, just might be better use further back from the lines.
I'll use him as a runner.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
Now get out of here.
Hear the good news, Doc?
We're going in with the first waves.
Hey, you do that again I'll take your head off!
Fucking dominoes.
Iggy, have you ever heard news you considered to be bad?
The first ones off the ship, Doc.
Means we don't go over the side of the ship.
We hop on a tractor, they drive us right there.
Oh, shit, that is good news.
You see?
What'd I tell you?
What's going on?
Look at that.
We're killing them!
We're killing them, Doc.
I was promised 10 days of shelling.
You're giving me three and saying that's the best you can do?
I don't give a shit!
My men hit that beach with less than 10 and I'll be taking them home to their mamas in buckets!
Yeah, I know exactly why.
Because every Navy man with a scrambled egg on his chest wants to offload us here and sail to Japan so they can be there for the big finish, tell their kids they captured the Emperor all by themselves.
Well, you aren't going to Japan unless we take this piece of shit island!
These little pricks are dug in!
Okay, appreciate that, Jim.
Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
I'm okay.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
Jesus, Iggy, just leave me alone, all right?
How about you guys?
Knife?
Bayonet?
Kick in the ass?
How about you, Doc?
Sharpen your knife?
You sharpened it three times already.
Well, then I better make sure I didn't nick it.
Good man, Doc.
- Hey, Doc.
- Yeah.
When we land, try not to wave this kit around too much.
They got sharpshooters that are trained to look for them.
And they know that if they take out a corpsman another dozen Marines will die unattended.
All right?
Okay, Mike.
Yeah, right there.
Close the damn door.
For God's sake.
Yeah, like that's gonna help.
That your girlfriend, Chief?
Bet she's a pretty damn good- looking squaw.
Bet you're missing her, and that little wigwam of yours.
Welcome, all Marines off Iwo Jima.
We have a long- time wait...
It's what they do to prisoners,
- at least the lucky ones.
- Jesus.
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think about waving a white bandanna.
Poor Marines, so far from home for no good reason.
Think of your girls back home, waiting for you.
But a girl cannot stay home every night.
So who do you think they're with tonight?
And will she let him kiss her?
And will he comfort her at your funeral?
This sweet music is to make you think of your girls back home who are missing you.
This is all for now.
I'll see you tomorrow night.
Gunners!
Move, let's go!
Let's go, get up on the berm!
Gunners!
We're clear!
Get up the berm!
Baker Company, move out!
- Seen Second Platoon?
- I don't see them.
First Squad, move it out!
God, this place reeks.
- Go, go, go!
- Move out!
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go!
Go!
Go, go!
Drop your packs!
Go!
All clear!
- Jesus, you needed some exercise?
- He got lost.
A hundred landing craft heading for one beach and this guy gets lost.
Now I'm glad we did.
Jesus, what a mess.
Any theories why they ain't shooting?
It's getting on my nerves.
Maybe they're all dead.
What do you think, Doc?
You think they're all dead?
Mike, take six men and bring that gun onto the beach.
Second Platoon, let's move out!
Stay down.
Come on.
Move!
Move!
- Get down!
- Take cover!
Move out!
Cover fire!
Pour it on!
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!
Corpsman!
I'm gonna sling your arm and then I'll give you a shot for the pain!
Move, move!
Off the beach!
Take cover!
You got a girl back home, Marine?
We're gonna make sure she sees you, all right?
I need pressure on this wound!
Where's the fire coming from?
Where are they?
Look for a flash, shoot at it!
Let's go, let...
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!
You're over!
Third Squad, forward!
Move!
Where are they, sir?
We got ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock, pillbox!
Sergeant!
- Sergeant!
I think I can clear that out.
- What?
All right, you go.
Here.
Take these.
Check your weapon.
Yeah?
Go!
Cover!
Cover him!
Cover, cover!
Son- of- a- bitch.
Let's go!
Go!
Move it out!
Go, go, go!
Down, down, down!
It's clear.
Good work.
I thought you said it was clear!
It was!
Shit, I guess they're not in there firing at us then.
Lindberg!
Yeah!
Light it up!
I'll cover you, Ice!
Don't cover shit!
There's already enough people shooting!
One bullet and this thing goes up like a Roman candle!
Go!
Shift fire!
Shift your fire!
Go, go!
Shift your fire!
Shift your fire!
Go!
Move it out!
Hit the deck!
Stay down!
Wait for support!
Is this a bad battle or what?
It's a fucking slaughter.
Christ Jesus!
Get a machine gun team set up over here, now!
Thank God!
Tanks!
Runner!
Get those tanks up here!
Oh, shit.
Get down!
Corporal, watch your left flank!
Let's go without them!
Move out!
Move out!
Iggy, you gotta lift your side, he's gonna roll off.
Got it, Doc!
Incoming!
Move, move, move, move!
Keep moving!
Get that LVT up on the beach!
Keep moving!
You're next, pal, we're getting you out of here.
Move it!
Great news.
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa, 'cause that's where we're headed.
Not you and me.
Captain Severance asked me who else was in that picture, and Christ if I could remember, but it was Mike and Doc and Franklin and me and Hank Hansen but I just remembered, you were there, too.
I wasn't there.
'Course you were.
Neither was Hank.
He raised the first flag.
It was Harlon Block that raised that one.
Shit.
I told them it was Hank.
You weren't there, Mr. Smart Ass, how'd you know it was Harlon?
- You tell them it was me?
- No.
Like I said, I just remembered.
Good, keep your mouth shut.
They know there was somebody else, you can see it in the picture.
Then pick someone dead.
They don't want somebody dead, you dumb redskin, they want to ship us back to the States.
What did I tell you?
I wasn't there.
- You hear?
- All right.
Just settle down.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're not going anywhere.
Who the hell says?
This is horseshit.
You wounded, son?
No, sir.
Well, did you take out a nest of Japs butt- naked with your bare hands?
'Cause if I'm gonna give up my seat to a hero he better have a good goddamn story to tell.
No, sir.
Then enjoy it, 'cause they'll forget you before Christmas.
The sixth man, you got a name?
Sorry, still don't remember.
It's a damn shame, 'cause I promised the Major you'd know who it was.
Fact, you not knowing throws a doubt on you being one of the flag- raisers yourself.
Since no one wants to be embarrassed, the moment you land they'll turn you around, ship you off to Okinawa in time to meet your buddies on the beach.
So, why don't you stop screwing with me?
Give me a damn name.
Gangway!
Gangway!
Let's go, let's go!
Gangway!
Where the hell is that son-of-a-bitch?
Hayes!
Hayes?
Hayes, get your red ass over here!
Make me look like I don't know what my own men are doing with a flag the size of my mother's house?
God damn it, Ira, you shouldn't have lied to me.
You made me look like a complete asshole.
We're gonna miss you around here.
Good luck.
Now your name's in the paper, too.
Just heard your doctor say we're postponing your operation.
You're being shipped back to the mainland.
Everybody who saw that picture thought planting the flag meant victory.
That's all they wanted to know.
Victory.
Within a few weeks of that picture being taken, half the men in it were dead.
Mrs. Hansen!
Mrs. Hansen!
Did you know Hank was a hero?
- Are you proud of him, Mrs. Hansen?
- What was he like as a boy?
Look this way, please, ma'am.
What do you have to say about your son?
But somehow being a part of it meant something.
Looking at it, you could believe their sacrifice was not a waste.
Yeah, I might have thought that was Harlon, too.
It is.
Belle, their names are right here.
It's not him.
And he would be alive and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.
You think about that when you look at his picture, Ed.
And I need to rush home and change because there's the Governor's banquet and then there's the parade.
Imagine, the Governor is coming here to meet us.
Now, I'm wearing blue so, if...
- Are you going to change?
- We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin from CBS World News.
A press association has just announced that President Roosevelt is dead.
The President died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
All we know so far is that the President died at Warm Springs in Georgia.
Further updates every hour.
Temperatures will remain the same today, in the mid- 30s to low 40s with clear skies.
Hello?
Yes.
Of course.
No, we understand.
It wouldn't be right.
Thank you.
Here he is, gentlemen.
Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.
Senator Haddigan.
I'd like you to meet Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Damn good to meet you.
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.
Sorry?
That's Pima Indian talk, boy, don't you know your own language?
Took forever to memorize the damn gibberish.
Sorry, I've been away from the reservation too long, Senator.
- Doc.
- Ira.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
- That's you.
- Go, go, go, go.
Go.
Please welcome
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley,
Private First Class Ira Hayes,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon!
Holy shit.
Come in, come in, come in.
Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Bud Gurber.
- You showing the boys the sights?
- We saw a hell of a ball game.
That's great.
The bar's there, help yourself.
I got some briefing sheets for you here, just some simple things we want you to say.
Mostly, "Buy bonds," can't say that too often.
Itineraries, those are changing every couple minutes.
Everybody wants to meet you guys.
I got women sending up envelopes with stockings in them, notes written in lipstick.
We won't mention that to the press, am I right?
Have a drink, for Christ's sake.
My God, what you boys must have seen over there.
I've been watching the newsreels.
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.
So, we got a hell of a lot of money to raise, not a lot of time.
White House tomorrow, then we trot you over to shake hands with a couple of hundred Congressmen who won't pull a penny out of their pockets.
Politicians and actors.
You put them in a restaurant together, they'd die of old age before picking up the check.
Then New York City, Times Square, dinners with various hoi polloi, then Chicago...
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?
That's what we're calling the mothers of the dead flag- raisers.
You present each mother with a flag, they say a few words, people will shit money.
It'll be so moving.
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.
Lovely woman.
She knows how close you and her son were.
He wrote home about you.
She is very, very much looking forward to meeting you.
Hank wasn't in the picture.
Sorry?
Hank didn't raise that flag.
He raised the other one, the real flag.
The what?
The real...
The real flag?
There's a real flag?
Yeah, ours was the replacement flag.
We put it up when they took the other one down.
Am I the only one getting a headache here?
You know about this?
It was after it was already in the papers.
The mothers had already been told, but...
That's it, that's beautiful.
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Yeah, why tell me?
I'm only the guy that has to explain it to 150 million Americans.
Who is in the goddamn picture?
Are any of you guys in the goddamn picture?
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.
Six guys raising a flag over lwo Jima.
Victory is ours.
You're three of them, right?
This was the fifth day, sir.
The battle went on for 35 more.
Well, what'd you do, raise a goddamn flag every time you stopped for lunch?
Can I hit this guy?
You know what, I don't give a shit, you're in the picture, you raised the flag, that's the story we're selling, boys.
Are you deaf?
Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?
Harlon Block.
That's whose mother should be here if anyone's should be.
You know, I think this whole damn thing is a farce, you ask me.
You know what they're calling this bond drive?
The Mighty Seventh.
They might've called it the
"We're Flat Fucking Broke And Can't Even Afford Bullets
"So We're Begging For Your Pennies" bond drive, but it didn't have quite the ring.
They could've called it that, though, because the last four bond drives came up so short we just printed money instead.
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street, he'll tell you our dollar is next to worthless, we borrowed so much.
And nobody is lending any more.
Ships aren't being built.
Tanks aren't being built.
Machine guns, bazookas, hand grenades, zip.
You think this is a farce?
You want to go back to your buddies?
Well, stuff some rocks in your pockets before you get on the plane because that's all we got left to throw at the Japanese.
And don't be surprised if your plane doesn't make it off the runway because the fuel dumps are empty.
And our good friends, the Arabs, are only taking bullion.
If we don't raise $14 billion, and that's million with a "B," this war is over by the end of the month.
We make a deal with the Japanese, we give whatever they want and we come home, because you've seen them fight, and they sure as shit ain't giving up.
$14 billion.
The last three drives didn't make that much all together.
People on the street corners, they looked at this picture and they took hope.
Don't ask me why, I think it's a crappy picture myself.
You can't even see your faces.
But it said we can win this war, are winning this war, we just need you to dig a little deeper.
They want to give us that money.
No, they want to give it to you.
But you, you don't want to ask for it.
You don't want to give them hope.
You want to explain about this person and that flag.
Well, that's your choice.
Because if we admit we made a mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about and that will be that.
Gentlemen.
Mr. President, here they are.
- Well, hello.
Good to see you.
- Mr. President.
Darn good to see you, boys.
Heard you had a hell of a fight on your hands out there, hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation in Arizona, am I right?
Yes, Mr. President.
Being an Indian, you are a truer American than any of us.
Bet your people are proud to see you wear that uniform.
Very proud, sir.
They should be.
Well, I want to thank you for coming all this way to Washington to help us out.
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific now we need you to fight for a mountain of cash.
- And I don't expect you'll let us down.
- No, sir.
Good.
Go get it.
That's the end of this ceremony.
Let's take a look at this famous photo over here, see if I can pick you out.
My gosh.
There you are.
Boys.
Boys, this one's on me.
To those who can't be with us.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon.
May we have your autograph?
I suppose.
And your name is?
I don't know about you, but I get the impression
I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.
You're such a hero.
I feel honored to be in your presence.
That's just not true.
That's professional work.
Here, to professionals.
Here they are.
You're the guys in the photograph, right?
I heard you were on the train.
Let me shake your hands, John Tennack.
John Bradley.
These boys are with me, Harvard and Yale types, didn't fight a lick.
Pappies all rich sons- of- bitches.
Boys, shake hands with some real war heroes.
Excuse me for one moment.
You can buy them a drink while you're at it.
That's right.
Drinks for these men all the way around.
And you're the other one, aren't you?
John Tennack, Tennack Homes.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Pleased to meet you.
Have a drink, come on.
And here's my card.
Listen to me, Rene, when you get finished being famous you come see me because if you can sell bonds, you can sell homes.
Now, they're not gonna build homes anymore, they're gonna deliver them.
- You heard of prefab homes?
- No, sir.
Well, you will.
And you hang on to that card and you come see me, you hear?
- All right?
- Certainly will.
All right.
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?
If Mike and the guys could see us.
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it, would they?
Harlon!
Franklin!
Can you imagine Franklin on this train
eating at the dining car with all the silver?
We shouldn't be here, Doc.
There's gonna be a Hallelujah Day
When the boys have all come home to stay
And a million bands begin to play
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
And when we've lit the torch of liberty
In each blacked- out land across the sea
Ira!
Hey, Ira!
We heard the picture was posed!
What?
We heard you posed the picture!
Hey, Doc!
We're bigger than life, Doc!
And we'll heave a mighty sigh
When each gal can kiss the boy she kissed goodbye
And they'll come marching down Fifth Avenue
The United Nations in review
When this lovely dream has all come true
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
Good job.
Thank you.
Thank you, girls!
And now, here are the men you've been waiting to meet, the men in white.
Right behind me here, the heroes of Iwo Jima,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon,
Private First Class Ira Hayes, and Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley!
Thank you.
It's good of you people to come out tonight in support of the war effort.
We really need you to buy bonds, that's for sure.
'Cause we can't win the war without your help.
As far as us being the heroes of Iwo Jima, that's just not the case.
We really didn't do much at all.
Especially him.
Especially me.
I was just a runner.
That's it.
We put up a flag.
The pole we attached it to was heavy, so it took a number of us.
We had our picture taken doing it.
The real heroes are dead on that island.
And we'd appreciate it if you bought bonds in honor of them.
Thank you.
Jump on any grenades, Ira?
Take out any machine gun nests I missed?
At least I fired my weapon.
All right, knock it off.
You hit anything or were you too drunk then, too?
What?
Guys!
Come on!
Stop it.
Knock it off.
The tall man with the high hat will be coming down your way
Get your savings out when you hear him shout
"Any bonds today?"
Any bonds today?
Bonds of freedom that's what I'm selling
Any bonds today?
Rene, right here.
Sit between these two boys.
Here comes the freedom man
Asking you to buy a share of freedom today ...for us and they need our help.
And, if you think about it, I think you'll realize that buying more bonds is not just the right thing to do but the only thing to do.
Yes, this war has gone on too long.
We have given too many lives.
And its cost...
- Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
- Strawberry.
...has been far too high.
But if we waver now, if we don't dig deep and give more than we think we can then those sacrifices would be wasted...
Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
...and those lives lost in vain.
Let's move!
Go, go!
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over.
Where the hell are our tanks?
Stuck in the sand.
Captain says you're to go without them.
Christ.
That's real good work you're doing there, Rene.
All right, prepare to move out.
Pass the word.
Second Platoon!
Move!
Move!
Move!
All right, Second Platoon, on your feet!
Let's move out!
Jackass.
Let's move out!
Go, go!
Move, move, move!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Second Platoon, move out!
Doc!
Doc, get out of there!
Corpsman!
Doc!
Doc, get the hell out of there!
May I have your attention, please.
Train number 48 with service from New York City, Boston,
Rochester, New York,
Toledo, Ohio, and South Bend, Indiana is now arriving on Track 7.
Train number 48 now arriving on Track number 7.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.
- Come on, boys.
- Let's go.
- Watch your step, ma'am.
- Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the heroes of Iwo Jima.
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.
Private First Class Ira Hayes.
And Private First Class Rene Gagnon.
Doc, get the hell out of there!
May I have your attention, please.

Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.
Private First Class Ira Hayes.
And Private First Class Rene Gagnon.
Who the hell is that?
I don't know.
- Rene, is that your girl?
- Hey, what do they call you?
How about a photo?
Hey, look at that!
What's your name, doll?
What's your name?
Hey, she's a beauty.
Let's go find a saloon.
Smile, boys.
Give them their money's worth.
Hey, Doc, how's the tour going for you?
Thank you.
Where exactly are you staying?
- I'm not sure yet.
- Just forget about that.
Senator, I'd like you to meet Corpsman John Bradley.
- Doc, right?
- Yes, sir.
Nice to meet you, Senator.
Good to meet you, young man.
Now, we appreciate everything you've done and everything you're doing.
- Thank you, sir.
- Quite all right.
This is Captain White.
- Colonel Johns.
- We're proud of you, Corpsman.
And then Colonel McCourtney.
- Major General Green.
- Nice to meet you.
Senator, this is Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Of course!
Now I hear you used a tomahawk on those Japs.
Is that true, Chief?
No, sir.
Well, tell them you did, makes a better story, huh?
- Attaboy.
- This is Captain Green.
John?
Madeline Evelley.
I recognize you from all the photographs.
I'm Hank's mom.
It's so nice to meet you, ma'am.
Hank was always talking about you.
This is PFC Rene Gagnon.
Pleasure to meet you, son.
Thanks for everything.
- My pleasure.
- Not at all.
Ira, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Strank, Mike's mom.
It's all right.
When I got the telegram, I...
I don't know what I'm trying to say here.
Knowing he was with you that day and seeing him in that photograph,
I don't know why it makes me feel better, but it does.
- It's so silly, isn't it?
- No, it's not.
How are you, son?
Thank you very much.
We're the largest furniture wholesaler in Illinois.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
- I'll make sure he calls.
- Well, thank you.
Thank you.
Are you Rene?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Franklin's mother.
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.
I'm Pauline, Rene's girlfriend.
Would you mind?
Paper said that's Hank, and I honestly can't tell.
It's horrible of a mother not to know her own son, isn't it?
But that's him, isn't it?
Well, to be honest, ma'am, it happened so quick, and with everything that was going on it's kind of hard to remember who was where.
But...
Yeah, I think...
I think that's where he was.
That's Hank.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Excuse us.
Take him outside.
I'm Pauline.
- Very nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
He was the best Marine I ever knew.
Thank you.
- You okay, Chief?
- Oh, Christ!
I'm okay.
Yeah, you look it.
You're gonna screw this up, aren't you?
You're gonna screw it up for all of us.
I've got him.
Get some sleep, Ira.
- Mike?
- Yeah?
- You see this?
- What?
- Mike!
- Oh, shit, go!
He's killing me!
Hey, Doc, you think they got them all?
What?
Well, they're not shooting at us.
Maybe we killed them all.
Or they ran off in the night or something.
Or they're waiting for us to start climbing.
Third Platoon!
Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.
- Just us?
- Yeah, just us, lgg.
All right, Third Platoon, move!
I tag along?
Yeah, you can lead the way if you want.
Get a good shot of my face.
It's your ass I'm gonna make famous, Hank.
Hey, that'll work for me, too.
Lieutenant, if you make it to the top, put this up.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, Iggy.
They never shoot at the first patrol.
- They don't?
- No.
They want us to go up to the top, signal to the others that it's okay, then shoot everybody else as they come up the mountain.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Unless of course they want to make an example of us and discourage all the others.
I think you're full of crap, you know that, Hank?
Really?
Jesus.
Thank God that ain't us.
Told you.
Boots, spread them out and put them on a line.
Set up a perimeter!
First Squad!
- Hank?
Find me a pole.
- Yeah.
Let's put this flag up.
Watch it.
Right over here.
Right here.
That's good.
That's good.
Right here, right here.
Got that end?
Hold that steady.
Lindberg.
- Hey, who's got rope?
- Right here.
Give me something.
Yeah, good.
That work?
Do it, fellas.
Keep it coming.
USMC!
USMC!
Shit, look at that!
Jeez, look at that.
Get down!
Take cover!
Cover with that .30!
- Watch it!
Twenty yards down, Hank!
- You see them?
- I got about 20 yards, left side.
- Lindberg, get the flamethrower!
- Boots, you see them?
- Cover right!
- About 20 yards down!
Duck one!
- You see them?
Keep the cover on!
Second Squad, you see them?
Get me some grenades!
I see them!
You see them?
Right flank, over to the right!
Cover me, I'm going down!
Careful, Iggy.
Easy.
All clear!
Okay, guys, who wants to be famous?
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
- God damn it.
Strank!
- Sir?
They want a phone line run up to the top of the mountain.
Let me guess, they picked us.
Second Platoon, let's go.
Get some exercise.
Let's go!
Get off your ass.
Oh, shit!
Hope it still works, 'cause you're not getting mine!
- Get Forrestal!
- All right, then.
I don't know whose idea it was, Mr. Secretary.
Well, it was goddamn brilliant.
I want that flag, Holland.
Mark my words, raising that son- of- a- bitch means a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.
I want that flag.
Yes, sir.
I'll make sure no one touches it.
You can count on me.
Fuck that.
That flag belongs to the men in this battalion.
That son- of- a- bitch thinks that our men died taking this ground so we could hand over our flag to some politician to pin to his wall?
He's out of his goddamn mind!
Get me that flag, and find another one to replace it.
You've gotta be shitting me.
Gagnon!
Get your ass over here.
Hey.
Hi, fellas.
How's it going?
Missed a beautiful shot, Joe.
It's that kind of day.
- Hey, Mike.
- Hell of a view, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant!
Captain says he wants that flag.
He wants this flag?
Yes, sir.
- We just put the damn thing up.
- Yes, sir.
Some kind of flag shortage?
He wants you to put this one up instead.
Hey, Mike.
Do me a favor and put this up, will you?
Yes, sir.
All right, let's find a pole.
Take the flag down, boys.
Captain's orders.
You heard him, let's do it.
There you go.
Lordy, she's a heavy one.
All right, hang on.
Put this on.
One hell of a view, huh?
Good view from up here.
Yes, I'd say so myself.
All right.
- Not in your way here, am I, Joe?
- Nah, I'm fine, thanks.
Hey, Doc, you wanna give us a hand here?
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.
Ready?
Ready?
Let's go.
You get it?
I don't know.
I wish I could've seen their faces.
Nobody even noticed that second flag going up.
Everybody saw that damn picture and made up their own story about it.
But your dad and the others knew what they had done and what they had not done.
All your friends dying, it's hard not to be called a hero for saving somebody's life.
But for putting up a pole?
You gotta be kidding.
Hey!
It took a lot of talented folks a long time to make that thing.
Just wait till tonight when it's lit properly and there's thousands of cheering people in the stands.
It's gonna look a lot better.
So, stadium lights come down, spotlight comes up and you get your cue.
You charge up this thing with the flag, you plant it at the top.
You smile, you wave.
You know the drill.
You want us to plant the flag on a pile of papier- mache.
Hey, that's show biz.
And try and stand how you stood the first time you planted it.
Just, you know, pretend the other three guys are with you.
The dead guys.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, not a problem.
Good.
But where do we imagine Hank is standing?
Sorry?
Well, seeing that he wasn't there, it'll be kind of hard for us to leave a space for him.
I think you know exactly where he was.
You pointed him out to his mother.
This is bullshit.
I planted that damn thing once, and I'm not doing it again.
- Hayes!
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
Hayes.
Hayes, get your ass back here or you're going on report.
Hayes!
You wanna do your damn job?
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Come on!
He's with me!
Hey, he's with me!
- Back off!
- Sir, he's with me.
Okay?
He's with me.
Ira, put the goddamn chair down!
- Put the chair down, son!
- Put the chair down, Ira!
Tell them drop their sticks!
Ira, they're cops, they're supposed to have nightsticks.
You're not supposed to be in the street swinging a chair.
- Calm down, son.
- Sir, turn around, please.
That poster right there?
The one on the end, that's him.
- That's him?
- Yes, sir.
You read the papers?
Christ.
We got another fucking hero.
Get him out of here.
- Can you do that?
- Yes, sir.
Put the goddamn chair down.
And let's go.
Did you start this?
He didn't serve me!
I don't make the rules.
We don't serve Indians.
He needs to go sleep it off.
Soldier Field.
You hear that?
What the hell is that?
I can't figure it out.
Keep an eye out.
It sounds like it's coming from up there.
They're using grenades.
They're killing themselves.
Ira, let's go.
Come on.
Let's go, Ira.
Come on.
Thank God.
Jesus.
Look at you, Chief.
You found him.
Holy shit.
You would have to pick today.
Vandegrift is here with enough brass to start a fucking band.
Come on, let's go.
Can you walk?
- Yes, sir.
- By yourself?
All right, look.
I don't care if you have to carry him get him to the top, plant that flag, and don't fucking fall off.
Get him in his stuff.
I'll stall these guys for as long as I can.
Hurry up.
Jesus Christ.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Cover!
Harlon!
Harlon!
Get your fire team up in that position!
O'Hare!
First Fire Team!
Work around!
BAR, you, on the side of the ridge!
Covering fire, boys, go, go, go!
Jackson, work your team around to the left!
Cover!
Left flank!
Left flank!
Franklin, Gust, go check it out!
Hustle up, boys!
We got them!
Clear!
One hell of an experience.
Move out!
Cease fire!
They're my men!
You're targeting our men!
You're targeting our...
Get me another radio!
Sergeant?
Sergeant!
Mike!
Mike, Mike, Mike.
Mike?
Mike.
Hey, where's Doc?
Corpsman!
Oh, shit.
How's his breathing?
Harlon, move, buddy.
Hey, Mike.
Mike, Mike, can you hear us?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on, Mike.
Mike?
Mike, can you hear us?
All right, let's go!
Move out!
I'm gonna get a stretcher.
Let's take him down, move him off the beach.
Ladies and gentlemen, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Corpsman!
Hank!
Hank!
Doc, they killed me.
Harlon!
Doc, they killed me.
Come on, Harlon.
Harlon, stay with me.
Franklin!
I'm fine, Ira.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Does it open?
Iggy!
Iggy!
Iggy, are you down there?
Iggy!
Can't tell who it is, but he's one of ours.
I had to go outside to throw up.
Look what they did to the poor son-of-a-bitch.
You okay, Chief?
Just let it go.
If that doesn't pry open their wallets, nothing will.
Jesus Christ, he's drunk.
Goddamn Indians.
Come on, Chief.
Let's get you home.
That's not what I hear.
I called around, I'm not stupid.
He's been drunk since he started this damn tour, making a spectacle of himself.
Just about choked that poor woman at the reception, blubbering.
Jesus Christ, you're supposed to be watching these men.
Yes, sir.
Well, he's making us look like regular asses.
Well, with all due respect, sir, he never wanted to come on this trip in the first place.
We had to pull him, kicking and screaming, off that boat.
He wants to be with his unit.
What unit?
They're all fucking dead.
This is how he honors those men?
By drinking and throwing up, and...
You know what?
He wants it, great, we'll send him back.
Get him packed and on a train today.
He's an embarrassment to the uniform.
Yes, sir.
I'll do it.
Yeah, no, that's...
That's good.
That's what I want.
I know it's a good thing, raising the money and that, 'cause we need it.
But,
I can't take them calling me a hero.
All I did was try not to get shot.
Some of the things I saw done, things I did,
they weren't things to be proud of, you know?
Mike...
Mike was a hero.
You ever meet him?
No.
Best Marine I ever met.
You know, Chief, I think if Mike was sitting here instead of you he'd be saying the same thing about himself,
not being a hero.
Maybe.
He was a good guy.
But I think that he would be ashamed of me, seeing me the way I am.
Think I could see my ma before they ship me off?
Think they'd do that?
See my ma?
I'm sorry, Ira.
We got stories now to tell our kids, I guess.
Keep your head down.
All aboard.
Good luck, Chief.
I think I saw him once after that.
It was maybe six or seven years after the war.
I was working as a salesman, doing a lot of driving.
I was driving west across Texas.
I was just trying to get where I was going so I could get home.
And I saw this guy hitchhiking on the side of the road.
And, for a second, I thought it might've been him.
I always regret that I didn't stop, but I was in a hurry.
And he was an Indian.
We always told the press that Ira insisted that he was going back to fight with his unit which was at least partially true, but
that isn't what got the headlines.
We're engaged.
Excuse me a minute, darling.
- Hey, Doc?
- Yeah?
- Got a minute?
- Yeah.
I'll see you at the car.
- You hear I'm getting married?
- I did, Rene.
That's great.
Yeah, it's something she wants.
She waited for me all this time.
She's not used to all this, but she's a good girl.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
So, I was wondering if you'd be my best man.
Me?
Don't you have somebody at home, a buddy, you'd rather ask?
Well, I didn't really make many.
The ones who didn't go, it's...
Well, it's hard to even talk to them.
You know?
Yeah, I know.
I'd be proud to.
Thank you.
I better go drag her away from them before she announces
I'm gonna be president of General Motors or something.
All right.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Rene, you're a lucky man.
- Big smile, Mrs. Gagnon!
- Say cheese!
I couldn't complain because the press loved them, so they wrote more articles and people bought more bonds.
The tour went on with just Rene and your dad.
And the true heroes are the men who didn't make it home from lwo Jima, the men who died at Iwo Jima and in other campaigns.
We ask that you honor the memory of those men by buying the war bonds and helping us to win this war.
Thank you.
City after city, I thought the damn thing'd never end.
And this rumor kept going around that the photograph had been staged.
I remember your dad telling them that he wished he'd known he was having his picture taken because he would've ducked the hell out of it.
Whose idea was it?
Who wanted to stage the thing?
Come on, it was you?
Was there truth to the rumor that that picture was staged, Doc?
- Come on!
Doc?
- Can you answer that?
I remember when your dad got shot.
All hell was busting loose.
People back home saw that picture and thought it was over when we took Suribachi.
We wished.
Anyways, we're pinned down.
Mortars, shells, machine guns.
Fire coming from every which direction, right?
And we hear somebody call, "Corpsman down."
Corpsman down!
Blood was spurting out of his throat, and Doc was doing everything he could.
And the Corpsman looks up at him and he knows what this means, to be shot in the neck.
He knows he's dying, you can see that.
But still in his eyes, he's pleading with Doc to save his life.
And Doc can't.
- You okay, Doc?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah, you look fine.
- I'm okay.
Keep down, all right?
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.
Okay.
Corpsman.
Corpsman!
For God sake, Corpsman!
Corpsman?
Corpsman.
Incoming!
Let me see.
It's not that bad.
You're gonna be okay.
All right?
Just stay with me.
Look at me.
Took us a half- hour to find your dad.
He could've bled to death.
Coming down.
Thanks.
Vets'll tell you about being hit but not wanting to leave their buddies.
Usually, they're lying.
You'll take any excuse to get out of there.
But it happens.
You get the feeling you're letting them down.
I could see that in your dad's face.
He wanted to go, he'd seen enough.
But he didn't want to leave us.
Now, he was a hell of a good man, your dad.
Yeah.
While we were sitting there on the beach, we heard this great roar.
And we looked up.
That was the first of thousands of landings on Iwo.
- Look at that.
- Yeah.
How about that.
I'm gonna head back, all right?
Good luck.
That island saved a lot of lives.
A lot of lives.
I don't know what else to tell you.
After the bond tour my dad finally got his operation.
By the time he got home the war was over.
First thing he did was ask my mom to marry him.
Ira tried to get on with his life and put it all behind him.
Thank you for having me here today.
It's an honor to be in front of such a strong people.
Because of the war white men will understand Indians a lot better.
And it's going to be a better world.
But life had other plans for him.
You're...
You're him, aren't you?
You're the hero, right?
Great.
All right, kids, go get your picture taken.
Oh, that's great.
That's great.
All right, now say cheese.
Cheese!
That's great!
Okay.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Thanks.
- Come on.
- That's a hero, kids.
Hero, lift this basket, will you?
It's too heavy for me.
Rene tried to take advantage of those offers he'd received on the bond tour.
Yes.
G-A-G-N-O-N.
Right.
Pronounced Rene.
Rene, yes.
- Okay, I actually called last week.
- Yes.
Okay, yes.
Mr. Gagnon.
I gave Mr. Tennack your message.
I'm sure he'll call you.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
But he was yesterday's hero.
He even applied for a job at the local police station.
They said he wasn't qualified.
After working the factory with Pauline he tried a few things but spent the rest of his life as a janitor.
But Ira...
Ira!
You got a visitor.
Ira always made the news.
I could never find out why he did it, but one day Ira just took off.
He walked and hitched over 1,300 miles from Arizona to Texas.
He found Harlon Block's father working his field.
His wife, Belle, had left him soon after they discovered Harlon died.
She never forgave him for letting her son go off to war.
And Ira told him the truth, that it had been his son who raised the flag with them, his son in the photograph.
And then he just turned and walked away.
Though the flag- raising meant nothing to him, he somehow knew it would mean everything to them.
Thanks for calling.
Just as Belle knew all along.
The press soon found out and called Hank's mom with the news that it wasn't her son after all.
The last time they all saw each other was at the unveiling of the Marine Corps War Memorial.
And even though he planted the first flag above lwo Jima,
Hank's mother and father weren't invited.
Ira.
It's good to see you, Ira.
Hell of a statue.
It wasn't long after that that they found Ira.
The papers said he died of exposure.
There was no autopsy.
It was about that same time when my father got in his car early one morning telling my mom he had something to do.
He drove to a town on the other side of Wisconsin where Iggy's mom lived.
Ever since she heard the news about her son she'd been trying to find out how he died, and no one would tell her.
I never found out what he told her, but I can pretty much guarantee it wasn't the truth.
My mother would ask him what was troubling him.
He would never say.
And every year, as it got close to Memorial Day, the reporters would start calling asking to interview my father.
No, I'm sorry.
He's fishing in Canada.
We were always instructed to say the same thing.
Okay.
Thanks.
When Mr. McCandless retired, my father bought the funeral home where he'd worked since coming home.
He spent the rest of his life running the business and raising his family.
He never spoke about the war or about the flag-raising, never told us anything.
The first time I heard any of these stories was after he died.
Where is he?
Oh, God.
He's not here, Dad.
He died.
Who?
Who died?
Iggy.
Iggy.
Christ, poor Iggy.
I hadn't thought of him for years.
How do you know about Iggy?
You were calling for him, when you collapsed.
I wasn't looking for Iggy.
I was looking for you.
I wanted to...
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry I wasn't a better father.
Talked to you more.
I just...
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
You were the best father a man could have.
Did I ever tell you they took us swimming?
No, Dad.
After we planted the flag, we came down off the mountain and they let us swim.
It was the funniest thing.
All this fighting and we were jumping around in the water like kids.
That's the way I remember lggy now.
I finally came to the conclusion that maybe he was right.
Maybe there's no such thing as heroes.
Maybe there are just people like my dad.
I finally came to understand why they were so uncomfortable being called heroes.
Heroes are something we create, something we need.
It's a way for us to understand what is almost incomprehensible, how people could sacrifice so much for us.
But for my dad and these men, the risks they took, the wounds they suffered, they did that for their buddies.
They may have fought for their country, but they died for their friends.
For the man in front, for the man beside them.
And if we wish to truly honor these men, we should remember them the way they really were, the way my dad remembered them.
Come on, Doc!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
For God sakes!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Honey, what's wrong?
Every jackass thinks he knows what war is.
Especially those who've never been in one.
We like things nice and simple, good and evil, heroes and villains.
There's always plenty of both.
Most of the time, they are not who we think they are.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where...
Where is he?
Where is he?
Mr. Bradley?
Mr. B?
You okay?
- Where is he?
- Where is who?
Where is he?
Where did he go?
Where...
Where is he?
All right.
Just stay right here, okay?
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
It'll be okay.
Where is he?
Most guys I knew would never talk about what happened over there.
Probably 'cause they're still trying to forget about it.
They certainly didn't think of themselves as heroes.
They died without glory.
Nobody has taken their pictures.
Only their buddies knew what they did.
I'd tell their folks they died for their country.
I'm not sure that was it.
Now, there were plenty other photos taken that day, but none anybody wanted to see.
What we see and do in war, the cruelty, is unbelievable.
But somehow we gotta make some sense of it.
To do that, we need a easy to understand truth and damn few words.
Film's ruined.
I don't know.
This one looks all right.
And if you can get a picture...
Now, the right picture can win or lose a war.
You're gonna want to see this.
Look at Vietnam.
The picture of that South Vietnamese officer blowing that fella's brains out of the side of his head, whammo!
That was it.
The war was lost.
We just hung around trying to pretend it wasn't.
Took a lot of other pictures that day.
None of them made a difference.
Thanks.
Appreciate it.
Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.
Country was bankrupt.
People were becoming cynical and tired of war.
Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon!
Where?
Right there.
Planting that flag, that's your brother.
Ma, all you can see is his behind.
And that's his.
I powdered and diapered it, I know my son.
That's him.
Go get your father.
Daddy, Ma's got a picture of Harlon's keister in the paper.
You watch your mouth, young man.
Thank you.
One photo, almost all on its own, turned that around.
It's on the front page of every major paper.
Over 200 dailies and they're all flooded with requests for prints.
I think we might have found it.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- I gotta go get him.
- Oh, no, you don't.
Iggy, I gotta go.
I have a whole different theory.
He wants medical attention bad enough, he'll come to us.
Shut up and crawl over here, you lazy son-of-a-bitch!
As soon as that flare goes out.
- Crap.
Okay, well, I'll go with you.
- No.
You're actually gonna leave me here?
I'll be right back, just shoot some people.
I gotta go.
Oh, God.
Okay, it's okay.
Don't touch them.
Don't touch them.
Get your hands out of there.
Let me do that.
I'll do it, okay?
Don't look.
Keep your head back.
Keep your eyes on me.
All right, look at me.
I'll get it.
I'll take care of it.
We'll get this bandage on you.
We'll get you taken care of.
And we'll get you down to the bottom, all right?
Look, you're gonna be fine.
It's okay.
I'll do that.
I'll do that.
Here, put some pressure on that.
Put your hands on top and put some pressure on it.
Keep your head back.
Keep breathing.
Keep looking at me, all right?
Just keep looking at...
Doc.
Help me.
Help me.
All right.
Okay.
How's that feel?
- It feels good.
- It does?
All right.
- Good.
- All right.
I'm gonna go get a stretcher and get you down to the beach.
I'll be right back.
I'm all right.
Go and help someone who's hurt.
All right.
Hold on there.
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Holy shit.
They expect us to climb this?
Or something just like it.
So, where you think they're sending us?
I think it's the desert, Franklin.
Well, that makes no sense at all.
Well, it's just military psychology.
They always train you for the desert on a volcano.
Now you're just having fun with me.
Harlon, take your men right.
- Watch for Bedouins.
- Yes, sir.
- What's a Bedouin?
- It's a guy with a camel.
Well, Jeez Louise, maybe we are going to the desert.
Now, you tilt that to the right, but what if the bullet comes from the left?
Bullets don't come from the left.
You know any left-handed Japs?
That makes about as much sense as you showering with your shoes on.
You don't even know why you do it, do you?
'Cause I don't tell you mean I don't know?
You do it 'cause Mike does it.
I'll ask him.
So you cut hair back home?
Some.
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?
No, I just studied it a little.
But not in barber school?
Nope.
- Gosh.
- Let me guess, Hayes is winning.
Chief, I had very little to do with Sitting Bull's death, so maybe you could stop taking it out on me.
Different tribe.
The Pimas fought on the side of the white man.
- See, now that's smart.
- That is smart.
Yeah.
Worked real good for us.
Good luck, fellas.
Hey, good night, Lindberg.
Dead bodies.
He cuts hair on dead bodies.
What?
Even I knew that.
- Who's in?
- Oh, I'm in.
I'm in.
It must be a lot easier with them not moving around and all.
- There's that.
- Yeah.
You know what I been thinking?
Well, they been telling us we need to buddy up and I think we'd make pretty good buddies.
And how do you figure that?
Well, you know, in that we have a lot in common.
So, why do you cut dead people's hair, anyway?
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.
You tell a lot of people that?
You actually chose the Marines because they got the best uniform?
No sense being a hero if you don't look like one.
Jacks.
Queens.
Shit.
Do anything on that reservation but play cards, Chief?
All right, listen up, you sorry bunch of leathernecks!
We practice going over the side tomorrow which means we ain't long for this piece of rock.
All right!
One more thing, any man who doesn't have his masturbation papers in order better get them signed by tomorrow night or he ain't going overseas.
- I got mine already.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm square.
Wait.
Why am I just hearing about this?
That's horseshit, Franklin.
I don't have to repeat everything twice for you.
No, I didn't hear nothing about no masturbating papers.
Heard they were running short.
You know, nobody tells me nothing.
That's real nice, guys.
All right, get your ass over to the officer in charge of records.
Maybe he got some more left.
- Leave your smokes.
I'll play for you.
- Thanks, Mike.
Listen, he calls you an idiot, you take it like a man, okay?
Just do not leave without signing them.
- I appreciate it, Sergeant.
- You got it.
What the hell happened to your hair, Rene?
Look like a goddamn corpse.
Three points of contact on that rope at all times.
Next four.
Over the side.
Let's go.
Keep moving.
Next four, over the side.
Just keep your eye on the guy below you.
That's all you gotta look at.
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.
Keep three points of contact on the rope at all times.
You see?
No big thing.
Just one step at a time and keep your hands on the vertical rope.
Remember, once you're in the boat move away from the rope.
Just make sure you keep three points of contact on the rope.
I got him!
All right, get that man out of the water.
Give me a hand.
Grab his pack.
Don't worry about him, Doc.
All right, quit skylarking!
Keep it moving!
He'll be fine.
Our target, Island X, is an ugly, smelly, dirty little scab of rock called Iwo Jima.
It means "Sulfur Island," which accounts for the smell.
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop, you ask me.
After 20 straight days of bombing you won't find a blade of grass or a twig on it.
It wasn't that pretty to start with.
Captain?
Iwo's just five-and-a-half miles long, two-and-a-half wide.
There's a lump down at the bottom.
That's Mount Suribachi.
On the maps in front of you the island is white.
Not much of it.
The black dots represent known enemy emplacements.
Coastal defense guns, dual-mount dual-purpose guns, covered artillery emplacements.
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes, and earth-covered structures.
I don't see any barracks or any other structures.
That's right.
And we still don't know why.
Now, this isn't just any island to them.
This isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, or Saipan.
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders in eight square miles.
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.
It's up to us to convince them.
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.
The 8th Ammo Company will land here to re-supply.
The Suribachi's guns are the biggest problem.
They can hit any point on the island.
We're sitting ducks until we take them out.
That's our job.
We cut across the island, right at the base, slit its throat, lop off its head.
And we take that mountain.
We take that mountain, we take their big guns.
We take their eyes.
Okay, I'm heading in.
Follow me.
Let's put a good show on for the Marines.
Close it up.
Take it right down to the deck.
Yeah, boys!
Man overboard portside!
See him?
Throw me a line!
He's right there.
- Where is he?
- Watch out, watch out, watch out.
Hawaii's that way!
Just keep paddling, Mac, we'll catch you on the way back!
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!
They're not gonna stop.
What?
None of them are.
They can't.
So much for "No man left behind. "
- Sir.
- Come on in.
Look, I've had to make a few other changes.
I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
- You bet.
Trouble is, I already told my men I'd see them through this.
That your James Cagney impersonation?
'Cause I've heard better.
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.
Look, this isn't your first time through this.
- You don't need to prove anything.
- No, sir.
You're not the best sergeant I've ever had, you're just the best one that's still walking.
- Block's a good man.
- Yes, sir, he is.
The men know him, he can step right in.
You know, I have actually thought this through.
Platoon sergeant puts you further away from the bullets.
I already gave them my word, sir.
I told them I'd bring them all home to their mothers which means I already lied to half of them.
Can't lie to the rest.
- How are your men?
- They'll do fine.
Except maybe Gagnon.
Our own Tyrone Power?
Yes, sir.
He's a good man, just might be better use further back from the lines.
I'll use him as a runner.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
Now get out of here.
Hear the good news, Doc?
We're going in with the first waves.
Hey, you do that again I'll take your head off!
Fucking dominoes.
Iggy, have you ever heard news you considered to be bad?
The first ones off the ship, Doc.
Means we don't go over the side of the ship.
We hop on a tractor, they drive us right there.
Oh, shit, that is good news.
You see?
What'd I tell you?
What's going on?
Look at that.
We're killing them!
We're killing them, Doc.
I was promised 10 days of shelling.
You're giving me three and saying that's the best you can do?
I don't give a shit!
My men hit that beach with less than 10 and I'll be taking them home to their mamas in buckets!
Yeah, I know exactly why.
Because every Navy man with a scrambled egg on his chest wants to offload us here and sail to Japan so they can be there for the big finish, tell their kids they captured the Emperor all by themselves.
Well, you aren't going to Japan unless we take this piece of shit island!
These little pricks are dug in!
Okay, appreciate that, Jim.
Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
I'm okay.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
Jesus, Iggy, just leave me alone, all right?
How about you guys?
Knife?
Bayonet?
Kick in the ass?
How about you, Doc?
Sharpen your knife?
You sharpened it three times already.
Well, then I better make sure I didn't nick it.
Good man, Doc.
- Hey, Doc.
- Yeah.
When we land, try not to wave this kit around too much.
They got sharpshooters that are trained to look for them.
And they know that if they take out a corpsman another dozen Marines will die unattended.
All right?
Okay, Mike.
Yeah, right there.
Close the damn door.
For God's sake.
Yeah, like that's gonna help.
That your girlfriend, Chief?
Bet she's a pretty damn good-looking squaw.
Bet you're missing her, and that little wigwam of yours.
Welcome, all Marines off Iwo Jima.
We have a long-time wait...
It's what they do to prisoners,
- at least the lucky ones.
- Jesus.
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think about waving a white bandanna.
Poor Marines, so far from home for no good reason.
Think of your girls back home, waiting for you.
But a girl cannot stay home every night.
So who do you think they're with tonight?
And will she let him kiss her?
And will he comfort her at your funeral?
This sweet music is to make you think of your girls back home who are missing you.
This is all for now.
I'll see you tomorrow night.
Gunners!
Move, let's go!
Let's go, get up on the berm!
Gunners!
We're clear!
Get up the berm!
Baker Company, move out!
- Seen Second Platoon?
- I don't see them.
First Squad, move it out!
God, this place reeks.
- Go, go, go!
- Move out!
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go!
Go!
Go, go!
Drop your packs!
Go!
All clear!
- Jesus, you needed some exercise?
- He got lost.
A hundred landing craft heading for one beach and this guy gets lost.
Now I'm glad we did.
Jesus, what a mess.
Any theories why they ain't shooting?
It's getting on my nerves.
Maybe they're all dead.
What do you think, Doc?
You think they're all dead?
Mike, take six men and bring that gun onto the beach.
Second Platoon, let's move out!
Stay down.
Come on.
Move!
Move!
- Get down!
- Take cover!
Move out!
Cover fire!
Pour it on!
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!
Corpsman!
I'm gonna sling your arm and then I'll give you a shot for the pain!
Move, move!
Off the beach!
Take cover!
You got a girl back home, Marine?
We're gonna make sure she sees you, all right?
I need pressure on this wound!
Where's the fire coming from?
Where are they?
Look for a flash, shoot at it!
Let's go, let...
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!
You're over!
Third Squad, forward!
Move!
Where are they, sir?
We got ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock, pillbox!
Sergeant!
- Sergeant!
I think I can clear that out.
- What?
All right, you go.
Here.
Take these.
Check your weapon.
Yeah?
Go!
Cover!
Cover him!
Cover, cover!
Son-of-a-bitch.
Let's go!
Go!
Move it out!
Go, go, go!
Down, down, down!
It's clear.
Good work.
I thought you said it was clear!
It was!
Shit, I guess they're not in there firing at us then.
Lindberg!
Yeah!
Light it up!
I'll cover you, Ice!
Don't cover shit!
There's already enough people shooting!
One bullet and this thing goes up like a Roman candle!
Go!
Shift fire!
Shift your fire!
Go, go!
Shift your fire!
Shift your fire!
Go!
Move it out!
Hit the deck!
Stay down!
Wait for support!
Is this a bad battle or what?
It's a fucking slaughter.
Christ Jesus!
Get a machine gun team set up over here, now!
Thank God!
Tanks!
Runner!
Get those tanks up here!
Oh, shit.
Get down!
Corporal, watch your left flank!
Let's go without them!
Move out!
Move out!
Iggy, you gotta lift your side, he's gonna roll off.
Got it, Doc!
Incoming!
Move, move, move, move!
Keep moving!
Get that LVT up on the beach!
Keep moving!
You're next, pal, we're getting you out of here.
Move it!
Great news.
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa, 'cause that's where we're headed.
Not you and me.
Captain Severance asked me who else was in that picture, and Christ if I could remember, but it was Mike and Doc and Franklin and me and Hank Hansen but I just remembered, you were there, too.
I wasn't there.
'Course you were.
Neither was Hank.
He raised the first flag.
It was Harlon Block that raised that one.
Shit.
I told them it was Hank.
You weren't there, Mr. Smart Ass, how'd you know it was Harlon?
- You tell them it was me?
- No.
Like I said, I just remembered.
Good, keep your mouth shut.
They know there was somebody else, you can see it in the picture.
Then pick someone dead.
They don't want somebody dead, you dumb redskin, they want to ship us back to the States.
What did I tell you?
I wasn't there.
- You hear?
- All right.
Just settle down.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're not going anywhere.
Who the hell says?
This is horseshit.
You wounded, son?
No, sir.
Well, did you take out a nest of Japs butt-naked with your bare hands?
'Cause if I'm gonna give up my seat to a hero he better have a good goddamn story to tell.
No, sir.
Then enjoy it, 'cause they'll forget you before Christmas.
The sixth man, you got a name?
Sorry, still don't remember.
It's a damn shame, 'cause I promised the Major you'd know who it was.
Fact, you not knowing throws a doubt on you being one of the flag-raisers yourself.
Since no one wants to be embarrassed, the moment you land they'll turn you around, ship you off to Okinawa in time to meet your buddies on the beach.
So, why don't you stop screwing with me?
Give me a damn name.
Gangway!
Gangway!
Let's go, let's go!
Gangway!
Where the hell is that son-of-a-bitch?
Hayes!
Hayes?
Hayes, get your red ass over here!
Make me look like I don't know what my own men are doing with a flag the size of my mother's house?
God damn it, Ira, you shouldn't have lied to me.
You made me look like a complete asshole.
We're gonna miss you around here.
Good luck.
Now your name's in the paper, too.
Just heard your doctor say we're postponing your operation.
You're being shipped back to the mainland.
Everybody who saw that picture thought planting the flag meant victory.
That's all they wanted to know.
Victory.
Within a few weeks of that picture being taken, half the men in it were dead.
Mrs. Hansen!
Mrs. Hansen!
Did you know Hank was a hero?
- Are you proud of him, Mrs. Hansen?
- What was he like as a boy?
Look this way, please, ma'am.
What do you have to say about your son?
But somehow being a part of it meant something.
Looking at it, you could believe their sacrifice was not a waste.
Yeah, I might have thought that was Harlon, too.
It is.
Belle, their names are right here.
It's not him.
And he would be alive and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.
You think about that when you look at his picture, Ed.
And I need to rush home and change because there's the Governor's banquet and then there's the parade.
Imagine, the Governor is coming here to meet us.
Now, I'm wearing blue so, if...
- Are you going to change?
- We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin from CBS World News.
A press association has just announced that President Roosevelt is dead.
The President died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
All we know so far is that the President died at Warm Springs in Georgia.
Further updates every hour.
Temperatures will remain the same today, in the mid-30s to low 40s with clear skies.
Hello?
Yes.
Of course.
No, we understand.
It wouldn't be right.
Thank you.
Here he is, gentlemen.
Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.
Senator Haddigan.
I'd like you to meet Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Damn good to meet you.
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.
Sorry?
That's Pima Indian talk, boy, don't you know your own language?
Took forever to memorize the damn gibberish.
Sorry, I've been away from the reservation too long, Senator.
- Doc.
- Ira.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
- That's you.
- Go, go, go, go.
Go.
Please welcome
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley,
Private First Class Ira Hayes,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon!
Holy shit.
Come in, come in, come in.
Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Bud Gurber.
- You showing the boys the sights?
- We saw a hell of a ball game.
That's great.
The bar's there, help yourself.
I got some briefing sheets for you here, just some simple things we want you to say.
Mostly, "Buy bonds," can't say that too often.
Itineraries, those are changing every couple minutes.
Everybody wants to meet you guys.
I got women sending up envelopes with stockings in them, notes written in lipstick.
We won't mention that to the press, am I right?
Have a drink, for Christ's sake.
My God, what you boys must have seen over there.
I've been watching the newsreels.
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.
So, we got a hell of a lot of money to raise, not a lot of time.
White House tomorrow, then we trot you over to shake hands with a couple of hundred Congressmen who won't pull a penny out of their pockets.
Politicians and actors.
You put them in a restaurant together, they'd die of old age before picking up the check.
Then New York City, Times Square, dinners with various hoi polloi, then Chicago...
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?
That's what we're calling the mothers of the dead flag-raisers.
You present each mother with a flag, they say a few words, people will shit money.
It'll be so moving.
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.
Lovely woman.
She knows how close you and her son were.
He wrote home about you.
She is very, very much looking forward to meeting you.
Hank wasn't in the picture.
Sorry?
Hank didn't raise that flag.
He raised the other one, the real flag.
The what?
The real...
The real flag?
There's a real flag?
Yeah, ours was the replacement flag.
We put it up when they took the other one down.
Am I the only one getting a headache here?
You know about this?
It was after it was already in the papers.
The mothers had already been told, but...
That's it, that's beautiful.
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Yeah, why tell me?
I'm only the guy that has to explain it to 150 million Americans.
Who is in the goddamn picture?
Are any of you guys in the goddamn picture?
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.
Six guys raising a flag over Iwo Jima.
Victory is ours.
You're three of them, right?
This was the fifth day, sir.
The battle went on for 35 more.
Well, what'd you do, raise a goddamn flag every time you stopped for lunch?
Can I hit this guy?
You know what, I don't give a shit, you're in the picture, you raised the flag, that's the story we're selling, boys.
Are you deaf?
Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?
Harlon Block.
That's whose mother should be here if anyone's should be.
You know, I think this whole damn thing is a farce, you ask me.
You know what they're calling this bond drive?
The Mighty Seventh.
They might've called it the
"We're Flat Fucking Broke And Can't Even Afford Bullets
"So We're Begging For Your Pennies" bond drive, but it didn't have quite the ring.
They could've called it that, though, because the last four bond drives came up so short we just printed money instead.
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street, he'll tell you our dollar is next to worthless, we borrowed so much.
And nobody is lending any more.
Ships aren't being built.
Tanks aren't being built.
Machine guns, bazookas, hand grenades, zip.
You think this is a farce?
You want to go back to your buddies?
Well, stuff some rocks in your pockets before you get on the plane because that's all we got left to throw at the Japanese.
And don't be surprised if your plane doesn't make it off the runway because the fuel dumps are empty.
And our good friends, the Arabs, are only taking bullion.
If we don't raise $14 billion, and that's million with a "B," this war is over by the end of the month.
We make a deal with the Japanese, we give whatever they want and we come home, because you've seen them fight, and they sure as shit ain't giving up.
$14 billion.
The last three drives didn't make that much all together.
People on the street corners, they looked at this picture and they took hope.
Don't ask me why, I think it's a crappy picture myself.
You can't even see your faces.
But it said we can win this war, are winning this war, we just need you to dig a little deeper.
They want to give us that money.
No, they want to give it to you.
But you, you don't want to ask for it.
You don't want to give them hope.
You want to explain about this person and that flag.
Well, that's your choice.
Because if we admit we made a mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about and that will be that.
Gentlemen.
Mr. President, here they are.
- Well, hello.
Good to see you.
- Mr. President.
Darn good to see you, boys.
Heard you had a hell of a fight on your hands out there, hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation in Arizona, am I right?
Yes, Mr. President.
Being an Indian, you are a truer American than any of us.
Bet your people are proud to see you wear that uniform.
Very proud, sir.
They should be.
Well, I want to thank you for coming all this way to Washington to help us out.
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific now we need you to fight for a mountain of cash.
- And I don't expect you'll let us down.
- No, sir.
Good.
Go get it.
That's the end of this ceremony.
Let's take a look at this famous photo over here, see if I can pick you out.
My gosh.
There you are.
Boys.
Boys, this one's on me.
To those who can't be with us.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon.
May we have your autograph?
I suppose.
And your name is?
I don't know about you, but I get the impression
I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.
You're such a hero.
I feel honored to be in your presence.
That's just not true.
That's professional work.
Here, to professionals.
Here they are.
You're the guys in the photograph, right?
I heard you were on the train.
Let me shake your hands, John Tennack.
John Bradley.
These boys are with me, Harvard and Yale types, didn't fight a lick.
Pappies all rich sons-of-bitches.
Boys, shake hands with some real war heroes.
Excuse me for one moment.
You can buy them a drink while you're at it.
That's right.
Drinks for these men all the way around.
And you're the other one, aren't you?
John Tennack, Tennack Homes.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Pleased to meet you.
Have a drink, come on.
And here's my card.
Listen to me, Rene, when you get finished being famous you come see me because if you can sell bonds, you can sell homes.
Now, they're not gonna build homes anymore, they're gonna deliver them.
- You heard of prefab homes?
- No, sir.
Well, you will.
And you hang on to that card and you come see me, you hear?
- All right?
- Certainly will.
All right.
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?
If Mike and the guys could see us.
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it, would they?
Harlon!
Franklin!
Can you imagine Franklin on this train
eating at the dining car with all the silver?
We shouldn't be here, Doc.
There's gonna be a Hallelujah Day
When the boys have all come home to stay
And a million bands begin to play
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
And when we've lit the torch of liberty
In each blacked-out land across the sea
Ira!
Hey, Ira!
We heard the picture was posed!
What?
We heard you posed the picture!
Hey, Doc!
We're bigger than life, Doc!
And we'll heave a mighty sigh
When each gal can kiss the boy she kissed goodbye
And they'll come marching down Fifth Avenue
The United Nations in review
When this lovely dream has all come true
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
Good job.
Thank you.
Thank you, girls!
And now, here are the men you've been waiting to meet, the men in white.
Right behind me here, the heroes of Iwo Jima,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon,
Private First Class Ira Hayes, and Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley!
Thank you.
It's good of you people to come out tonight in support of the war effort.
We really need you to buy bonds, that's for sure.
'Cause we can't win the war without your help.
As far as us being the heroes of Iwo Jima, that's just not the case.
We really didn't do much at all.
Especially him.
Especially me.
I was just a runner.
That's it.
We put up a flag.
The pole we attached it to was heavy, so it took a number of us.
We had our picture taken doing it.
The real heroes are dead on that island.
And we'd appreciate it if you bought bonds in honor of them.
Thank you.
Jump on any grenades, Ira?
Take out any machine gun nests I missed?
At least I fired my weapon.
All right, knock it off.
You hit anything or were you too drunk then, too?
What?
Guys!
Come on!
Stop it.
Knock it off.
The tall man with the high hat will be coming down your way
Get your savings out when you hear him shout
"Any bonds today?"
Any bonds today?
Bonds of freedom that's what I'm selling
Any bonds today?
Rene, right here.
Sit between these two boys.
Here comes the freedom man
Asking you to buy a share of freedom today ...for us and they need our help.
And, if you think about it, I think you'll realize that buying more bonds is not just the right thing to do but the only thing to do.
Yes, this war has gone on too long.
We have given too many lives.
And its cost...
- Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
- Strawberry.
...has been far too high.
But if we waver now, if we don't dig deep and give more than we think we can then those sacrifices would be wasted...
Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
...and those lives lost in vain.
Let's move!
Go, go!
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over.
Where the hell are our tanks?
Stuck in the sand.
Captain says you're to go without them.
Christ.
That's real good work you're doing there, Rene.
All right, prepare to move out.
Pass the word.
Second Platoon!
Move!
Move!
Move!
All right, Second Platoon, on your feet!
Let's move out!
Jackass.
Let's move out!
Go, go!
Move, move, move!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Second Platoon, move out!
Doc!
Doc, get out of there!
Corpsman!
Doc!
Doc, get the hell out of there!
May I have your attention, please.
Train number 48 with service from New York City, Boston,
Rochester, New York,
Toledo, Ohio, and South Bend, Indiana is now arriving on Track 7.
Train number 48 now arriving on Track number 7.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.
- Come on, boys.
- Let's go.
- Watch your step, ma'am.
- Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the heroes of Iwo Jima.
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.
Private First Class Ira Hayes.
And Private First Class Rene Gagnon.
Rene!
That's my boyfriend!
Who the hell is that?
I don't know.
- Rene, is that your girl?
- Hey, what do they call you?
How about a photo?
Hey, look at that!
What's your name, doll?
What's your name?
Hey, she's a beauty.
Let's go find a saloon.
Smile, boys.
Give them their money's worth.
Hey, Doc, how's the tour going for you?
Thank you.
Where exactly are you staying?
- I'm not sure yet.
- Just forget about that.
Senator, I'd like you to meet Corpsman John Bradley.
- Doc, right?
- Yes, sir.
Nice to meet you, Senator.
Good to meet you, young man.
Now, we appreciate everything you've done and everything you're doing.
- Thank you, sir.
- Quite all right.
This is Captain White.
- Colonel Johns.
- We're proud of you, Corpsman.
And then Colonel McCourtney.
- Major General Green.
- Nice to meet you.
Senator, this is Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Of course!
Now I hear you used a tomahawk on those Japs.
Is that true, Chief?
No, sir.
Well, tell them you did, makes a better story, huh?
- Attaboy.
- This is Captain Green.
John?
Madeline Evelley.
I recognize you from all the photographs.
I'm Hank's mom.
It's so nice to meet you, ma'am.
Hank was always talking about you.
This is PFC Rene Gagnon.
Pleasure to meet you, son.
Thanks for everything.
- My pleasure.
- Not at all.
Ira, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Strank, Mike's mom.
It's all right.
When I got the telegram, I...
I don't know what I'm trying to say here.
Knowing he was with you that day and seeing him in that photograph,
I don't know why it makes me feel better, but it does.
- It's so silly, isn't it?
- No, it's not.
How are you, son?
Thank you very much.
We're the largest furniture wholesaler in Illinois.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
- I'll make sure he calls.
- Well, thank you.
Thank you.
Are you Rene?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Franklin's mother.
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.
I'm Pauline, Rene's girlfriend.
Would you mind?
Paper said that's Hank, and I honestly can't tell.
It's horrible of a mother not to know her own son, isn't it?
But that's him, isn't it?
Well, to be honest, ma'am, it happened so quick, and with everything that was going on it's kind of hard to remember who was where.
But...
Yeah, I think...
I think that's where he was.
That's Hank.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Excuse us.
Take him outside.
I'm Pauline.
- Very nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
He was the best Marine I ever knew.
Thank you.
- You okay, Chief?
- Oh, Christ!
I'm okay.
Yeah, you look it.
You're gonna screw this up, aren't you?
You're gonna screw it up for all of us.
I've got him.
Get some sleep, Ira.
- Mike?
- Yeah?
- You see this?
- What?
- Mike!
- Oh, shit, go!
He's killing me!
Hey, Doc, you think they got them all?
What?
Well, they're not shooting at us.
Maybe we killed them all.
Or they ran off in the night or something.
Or they're waiting for us to start climbing.
Third Platoon!
Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.
- Just us?
- Yeah, just us, Igg.
All right, Third Platoon, move!
I tag along?
Yeah, you can lead the way if you want.
Get a good shot of my face.
It's your ass I'm gonna make famous, Hank.
Hey, that'll work for me, too.
Lieutenant, if you make it to the top, put this up.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, Iggy.
They never shoot at the first patrol.
- They don't?
- No.
They want us to go up to the top, signal to the others that it's okay, then shoot everybody else as they come up the mountain.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Unless of course they want to make an example of us and discourage all the others.
I think you're full of crap, you know that, Hank?
Really?
Jesus.
Thank God that ain't us.
Told you.
Boots, spread them out and put them on a line.
Set up a perimeter!
First Squad!
- Hank?
Find me a pole.
- Yeah.
Let's put this flag up.
Watch it.
Right over here.
Right here.
That's good.
That's good.
Right here, right here.
Got that end?
Hold that steady.
Lindberg.
- Hey, who's got rope?
- Right here.
Give me something.
Yeah, good.
That work?
Do it, fellas.
Keep it coming.
USMC!
USMC!
Shit, look at that!
Jeez, look at that.
Get down!
Take cover!
Cover with that.30!
- Watch it!
Twenty yards down, Hank!
- You see them?
- I got about 20 yards, left side.
- Lindberg, get the flamethrower!
- Boots, you see them?
- Cover right!
- About 20 yards down!
Duck one!
- You see them?
Keep the cover on!
Second Squad, you see them?
Get me some grenades!
I see them!
You see them?
Right flank, over to the right!
Cover me, I'm going down!
Careful, Iggy.
Easy.
All clear!
Okay, guys, who wants to be famous?
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
- God damn it.
Strank!
- Sir?
They want a phone line run up to the top of the mountain.
Let me guess, they picked us.
Second Platoon, let's go.
Get some exercise.
Let's go!
Get off your ass.
Oh, shit!
Hope it still works, 'cause you're not getting mine!
- Get Forrestal!
- All right, then.
I don't know whose idea it was, Mr. Secretary.
Well, it was goddamn brilliant.
I want that flag, Holland.
Mark my words, raising that son-of-a-bitch means a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.
I want that flag.
Yes, sir.
I'll make sure no one touches it.
You can count on me.
Fuck that.
That flag belongs to the men in this battalion.
That son-of-a-bitch thinks that our men died taking this ground so we could hand over our flag to some politician to pin to his wall?
He's out of his goddamn mind!
Get me that flag, and find another one to replace it.
You've gotta be shitting me.
Gagnon!
Get your ass over here.
Hey.
Hi, fellas.
How's it going?
Missed a beautiful shot, Joe.
It's that kind of day.
- Hey, Mike.
- Hell of a view, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant!
Captain says he wants that flag.
He wants this flag?
Yes, sir.
- We just put the damn thing up.
- Yes, sir.
Some kind of flag shortage?
He wants you to put this one up instead.
Hey, Mike.
Do me a favor and put this up, will you?
Yes, sir.
All right, let's find a pole.
Take the flag down, boys.
Captain's orders.
You heard him, let's do it.
There you go.
Lordy, she's a heavy one.
All right, hang on.
Put this on.
One hell of a view, huh?
Good view from up here.
Yes, I'd say so myself.
All right.
- Not in your way here, am I, Joe?
- Nah, I'm fine, thanks.
Hey, Doc, you wanna give us a hand here?
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.
Ready?
Ready?
Let's go.
You get it?
I don't know.
I wish I could've seen their faces.
Nobody even noticed that second flag going up.
Everybody saw that damn picture and made up their own story about it.
But your dad and the others knew what they had done and what they had not done.
All your friends dying, it's hard not to be called a hero for saving somebody's life.
But for putting up a pole?
You gotta be kidding.
Hey!
It took a lot of talented folks a long time to make that thing.
Just wait till tonight when it's lit properly and there's thousands of cheering people in the stands.
It's gonna look a lot better.
So, stadium lights come down, spotlight comes up and you get your cue.
You charge up this thing with the flag, you plant it at the top.
You smile, you wave.
You know the drill.
You want us to plant the flag on a pile of papier-mâché.
Hey, that's show biz.
And try and stand how you stood the first time you planted it.
Just, you know, pretend the other three guys are with you.
The dead guys.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, not a problem.
Good.
But where do we imagine Hank is standing?
Sorry?
Well, seeing that he wasn't there, it'll be kind of hard for us to leave a space for him.
I think you know exactly where he was.
You pointed him out to his mother.
This is bullshit.
I planted that damn thing once, and I'm not doing it again.
- Hayes!
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
Hayes.
Hayes, get your ass back here or you're going on report.
Hayes!
You wanna do your damn job?
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Come on!
He's with me!
Hey, he's with me!
- Back off!
- Sir, he's with me.
Okay?
He's with me.
Ira, put the goddamn chair down!
- Put the chair down, son!
- Put the chair down, Ira!
Tell them drop their sticks!
Ira, they're cops, they're supposed to have nightsticks.
You're not supposed to be in the street swinging a chair.
- Calm down, son.
- Sir, turn around, please.
That poster right there?
The one on the end, that's him.
- That's him?
- Yes, sir.
You read the papers?
Christ.
We got another fucking hero.
Get him out of here.
- Can you do that?
- Yes, sir.
Put the goddamn chair down.
And let's go.
Did you start this?
He didn't serve me!
I don't make the rules.
We don't serve Indians.
He needs to go sleep it off.
Soldier Field.
You hear that?
What the hell is that?
I can't figure it out.
Keep an eye out.
It sounds like it's coming from up there.
They're using grenades.
They're killing themselves.
Ira, let's go.
Come on.
Let's go, Ira.
Come on.
Thank God.
Jesus.
Look at you, Chief.
You found him.
Holy shit.
You would have to pick today.
Vandegrift is here with enough brass to start a fucking band.
Come on, let's go.
Can you walk?
- Yes, sir.
- By yourself?
All right, look.
I don't care if you have to carry him get him to the top, plant that flag, and don't fucking fall off.
Get him in his stuff.
I'll stall these guys for as long as I can.
Hurry up.
Jesus Christ.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Cover!
Harlon!
Harlon!
Get your fire team up in that position!
O'Hare!
First Fire Team!
Work around!
BAR, you, on the side of the ridge!
Covering fire, boys, go, go, go!
Jackson, work your team around to the left!
Cover!
Left flank!
Left flank!
Franklin, Gust, go check it out!
Hustle up, boys!
We got them!
Clear!
One hell of an experience.
Move out!
Cease fire!
They're my men!
You're targeting our men!
You're targeting our...
Get me another radio!
Sergeant?
Sergeant!
Mike!
Mike, Mike, Mike.
Mike?
Mike.
Hey, where's Doc?
Corpsman!
Oh, shit.
How's his breathing?
Harlon, move, buddy.
Hey, Mike.
Mike, Mike, can you hear us?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on, Mike.
Mike?
Mike, can you hear us?
All right, let's go!
Move out!
I'm gonna get a stretcher.
Let's take him down, move him off the beach.
Ladies and gentlemen, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Corpsman!
Hank!
Hank!
Doc, they killed me.
Harlon!
Doc, they killed me.
Come on, Harlon.
Harlon, stay with me.
Franklin!
I'm fine, Ira.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Does it open?
Iggy!
Iggy!
Iggy, are you down there?
Iggy!
Can't tell who it is, but he's one of ours.
I had to go outside to throw up.
Look what they did to the poor son-of-a-bitch.
You okay, Chief?
Just let it go.
If that doesn't pry open their wallets, nothing will.
Jesus Christ, he's drunk.
Goddamn Indians.
Come on, Chief.
Let's get you home.
That's not what I hear.
I called around, I'm not stupid.
He's been drunk since he started this damn tour, making a spectacle of himself.
Just about choked that poor woman at the reception, blubbering.
Jesus Christ, you're supposed to be watching these men.
Yes, sir.
Well, he's making us look like regular asses.
Well, with all due respect, sir, he never wanted to come on this trip in the first place.
We had to pull him, kicking and screaming, off that boat.
He wants to be with his unit.
What unit?
They're all fucking dead.
This is how he honors those men?
By drinking and throwing up, and...
You know what?
He wants it, great, we'll send him back.
Get him packed and on a train today.
He's an embarrassment to the uniform.
Yes, sir.
I'll do it.
Yeah, no, that's...
That's good.
That's what I want.
I know it's a good thing, raising the money and that, 'cause we need it.
But,
I can't take them calling me a hero.
All I did was try not to get shot.
Some of the things I saw done, things I did,
they weren't things to be proud of, you know?
Mike...
Mike was a hero.
You ever meet him?
No.
Best Marine I ever met.
You know, Chief, I think if Mike was sitting here instead of you he'd be saying the same thing about himself,
not being a hero.
Maybe.
He was a good guy.
But I think that he would be ashamed of me, seeing me the way I am.
Think I could see my ma before they ship me off?
Think they'd do that?
See my ma?
I'm sorry, Ira.
We got stories now to tell our kids, I guess.
Keep your head down.
All aboard.
Good luck, Chief.
I think I saw him once after that.
It was maybe six or seven years after the war.
I was working as a salesman, doing a lot of driving.
I was driving west across Texas.
I was just trying to get where I was going so I could get home.
And I saw this guy hitchhiking on the side of the road.
And, for a second, I thought it might've been him.
I always regret that I didn't stop, but I was in a hurry.
And he was an Indian.
We always told the press that Ira insisted that he was going back to fight with his unit which was at least partially true, but
that isn't what got the headlines.
We're engaged.
Excuse me a minute, darling.
- Hey, Doc?
- Yeah?
- Got a minute?
- Yeah.
I'll see you at the car.
- You hear I'm getting married?
- I did, Rene.
That's great.
Yeah, it's something she wants.
She waited for me all this time.
She's not used to all this, but she's a good girl.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
So, I was wondering if you'd be my best man.
Me?
Don't you have somebody at home, a buddy, you'd rather ask?
Well, I didn't really make many.
The ones who didn't go, it's...
Well, it's hard to even talk to them.
You know?
Yeah, I know.
I'd be proud to.
Thank you.
I better go drag her away from them before she announces
I'm gonna be president of General Motors or something.
All right.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Rene, you're a lucky man.
- Big smile, Mrs. Gagnon!
- Say cheese!
I couldn't complain because the press loved them, so they wrote more articles and people bought more bonds.
The tour went on with just Rene and your dad.
And the true heroes are the men who didn't make it home from Iwo Jima, the men who died at Iwo Jima and in other campaigns.
We ask that you honor the memory of those men by buying the war bonds and helping us to win this war.
Thank you.
City after city, I thought the damn thing'd never end.
And this rumor kept going around that the photograph had been staged.
I remember your dad telling them that he wished he'd known he was having his picture taken because he would've ducked the hell out of it.
Whose idea was it?
Who wanted to stage the thing?
Come on, it was you?
Was there truth to the rumor that that picture was staged, Doc?
- Come on!
Doc?
- Can you answer that?
I remember when your dad got shot.
All hell was busting loose.
People back home saw that picture and thought it was over when we took Suribachi.
We wished.
Anyways, we're pinned down.
Mortars, shells, machine guns.
Fire coming from every which direction, right?
And we hear somebody call, "Corpsman down. "
Corpsman down!
Blood was spurting out of his throat, and Doc was doing everything he could.
And the Corpsman looks up at him and he knows what this means, to be shot in the neck.
He knows he's dying, you can see that.
But still in his eyes, he's pleading with Doc to save his life.
And Doc can't.
- You okay, Doc?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah, you look fine.
- I'm okay.
Keep down, all right?
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.
Okay.
Corpsman.
Corpsman!
For God sake, Corpsman!
Corpsman?
Corpsman.
Incoming!
Let me see.
It's not that bad.
You're gonna be okay.
All right?
Just stay with me.
Look at me.
Took us a half-hour to find your dad.
He could've bled to death.
Coming down.
Thanks.
Vets'll tell you about being hit but not wanting to leave their buddies.
Usually, they're lying.
You'll take any excuse to get out of there.
But it happens.
You get the feeling you're letting them down.
I could see that in your dad's face.
He wanted to go, he'd seen enough.
But he didn't want to leave us.
Now, he was a hell of a good man, your dad.
Yeah.
While we were sitting there on the beach, we heard this great roar.
And we looked up.
That was the first of thousands of landings on Iwo.
- Look at that.
- Yeah.
How about that.
I'm gonna head back, all right?
Good luck.
That island saved a lot of lives.
A lot of lives.
I don't know what else to tell you.
After the bond tour my dad finally got his operation.
By the time he got home the war was over.
First thing he did was ask my mom to marry him.
Ira tried to get on with his life and put it all behind him.
Thank you for having me here today.
It's an honor to be in front of such a strong people.
Because of the war white men will understand Indians a lot better.
And it's going to be a better world.
But life had other plans for him.
You're...
You're him, aren't you?
You're the hero, right?
Great.
All right, kids, go get your picture taken.
Oh, that's great.
That's great.
All right, now say cheese.
Cheese!
That's great!
Okay.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Thanks.
- Come on.
- That's a hero, kids.
Hero, lift this basket, will you?
It's too heavy for me.
Rene tried to take advantage of those offers he'd received on the bond tour.
Yes.
G-A-G-N-O-N.
Right.
Pronounced Rene.
Rene, yes.
- Okay, I actually called last week.
- Yes.
Okay, yes.
Mr. Gagnon.
I gave Mr. Tennack your message.
I'm sure he'll call you.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
But he was yesterday's hero.
He even applied for a job at the local police station.
They said he wasn't qualified.
After working the factory with Pauline he tried a few things but spent the rest of his life as a janitor.
But Ira...
Ira!
You got a visitor.
Ira always made the news.
I could never find out why he did it, but one day Ira just took off.
He walked and hitched over 1,300 miles from Arizona to Texas.
He found Harlon Block's father working his field.
His wife, Belle, had left him soon after they discovered Harlon died.
She never forgave him for letting her son go off to war.
And Ira told him the truth, that it had been his son who raised the flag with them, his son in the photograph.
And then he just turned and walked away.
Though the flag-raising meant nothing to him, he somehow knew it would mean everything to them.
Thanks for calling.
Just as Belle knew all along.
The press soon found out and called Hank's mom with the news that it wasn't her son after all.
The last time they all saw each other was at the unveiling of the Marine Corps War Memorial.
And even though he planted the first flag above Iwo Jima,
Hank's mother and father weren't invited.
Ira.
It's good to see you, Ira.
Hell of a statue.
It wasn't long after that that they found Ira.
The papers said he died of exposure.
There was no autopsy.
It was about that same time when my father got in his car early one morning telling my mom he had something to do.
He drove to a town on the other side of Wisconsin where Iggy's mom lived.
Ever since she heard the news about her son she'd been trying to find out how he died, and no one would tell her.
I never found out what he told her, but I can pretty much guarantee it wasn't the truth.
My mother would ask him what was troubling him.
He would never say.
And every year, as it got close to Memorial Day, the reporters would start calling asking to interview my father.
No, I'm sorry.
He's fishing in Canada.
We were always instructed to say the same thing.
Okay.
Thanks.
When Mr. McCandless retired, my father bought the funeral home where he'd worked since coming home.
He spent the rest of his life running the business and raising his family.
He never spoke about the war or about the flag-raising, never told us anything.
The first time I heard any of these stories was after he died.
Where is he?
Oh, God.
He's not here, Dad.
He died.
Who?
Who died?
Iggy.
Iggy.
Christ, poor Iggy.
I hadn't thought of him for years.
How do you know about Iggy?
You were calling for him, when you collapsed.
I wasn't looking for Iggy.
I was looking for you.
I wanted to...
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry I wasn't a better father.
Talked to you more.
I just...
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
You were the best father a man could have.
Did I ever tell you they took us swimming?
No, Dad.
After we planted the flag, we came down off the mountain and they let us swim.
It was the funniest thing.
All this fighting and we were jumping around in the water like kids.
That's the way I remember Iggy now.
I finally came to the conclusion that maybe he was right.
Maybe there's no such thing as heroes.
Maybe there are just people like my dad.
I finally came to understand why they were so uncomfortable being called heroes.
Heroes are something we create, something we need.
It's a way for us to understand what is almost incomprehensible, how people could sacrifice so much for us.
But for my dad and these men, the risks they took, the wounds they suffered, they did that for their buddies.
They may have fought for their country, but they died for their friends.
For the man in front, for the man beside them.
And if we wish to truly honor these men, we should remember them the way they really were, the way my dad remembered them.
Come on, Doc!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
For God sakes!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Honey, what's wrong?
Every jackass thinks he knows what war is.
Especially those who've never been in one.
We like things nice and simple, good and evil, heroes and villains.
There's always plenty of both.
Most of the time, they are not who we think they are.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where...
Where is he?
Where is he?
Mr. Bradley?
Mr. B?
You okay?
- Where is he?
- Where is who?
Where is he?
Where did he go?
Where...
Where is he?
All right.
Just stay right here, okay?
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
It'll be okay.
Where is he?
Most guys I knew would never talk about what happened over there.
Probably 'cause they're still trying to forget about it.
They certainly didn't think of themselves as heroes.
They died without glory.
Nobody has taken their pictures.
Only their buddies knew what they did.
I'd tell their folks they died for their country.
I'm not sure that was it.
Now, there were plenty other photos taken that day, but none anybody wanted to see.
What we see and do in war, the cruelty, is unbelievable.
But somehow we gotta make some sense of it.
To do that, we need a easy to understand truth and damn few words.
Film's ruined.
I don't know.
This one looks all right.
And if you can get a picture...
Now, the right picture can win or lose a war.
You're gonna want to see this.
Look at Vietnam.
The picture of that South Vietnamese officer blowing that fella's brains out of the side of his head, whammo!
That was it.
The war was lost.
We just hung around trying to pretend it wasn't.
Took a lot of other pictures that day.
None of them made a difference.
Thanks.
Appreciate it.
Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.
Country was bankrupt.
People were becoming cynical and tired of war.
Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon!
Where?
Right there.
Planting that flag, that's your brother.
Ma, all you can see is his behind.
And that's his.
I powdered and diapered it, I know my son.
That's him.
Go get your father.
Daddy, Ma's got a picture of Harlon's keister in the paper.
You watch your mouth, young man.
Thank you.
One photo, almost all on its own, turned that around.
It's on the front page of every major paper.
Over 200 dailies and they're all flooded with requests for prints.
I think we might have found it.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- I gotta go get him.
- Oh, no, you don't.
Iggy, I gotta go.
I have a whole different theory.
He wants medical attention bad enough, he'll come to us.
Shut up and crawl over here, you lazy son-of-a-bitch!
As soon as that flare goes out.
- Crap.
Okay, well, I'll go with you.
- No.
You're actually gonna leave me here?
I'll be right back, just shoot some people.
I gotta go.
Oh, God.
Okay, it's okay.
Don't touch them.
Don't touch them.
Get your hands out of there.
Let me do that.
I'll do it, okay?
Don't look.
Keep your head back.
Keep your eyes on me.
All right, look at me.
I'll get it.
I'll take care of it.
We'll get this bandage on you.
We'll get you taken care of.
And we'll get you down to the bottom, all right?
Look, you're gonna be fine.
It's okay.
I'll do that.
I'll do that.
Here, put some pressure on that.
Put your hands on top and put some pressure on it.
Keep your head back.
Keep breathing.
Keep looking at me, all right?
Just keep looking at...
Doc.
Help me.
Help me.
All right.
Okay.
How's that feel?
- It feels good.
- It does?
All right.
- Good.
- All right.
I'm gonna go get a stretcher and get you down to the beach.
I'll be right back.
I'm all right.
Go and help someone who's hurt.
All right.
Hold on there.
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Holy shit.
They expect us to climb this?
Or something just like it.
So, where you think they're sending us?
I think it's the desert, Franklin.
Well, that makes no sense at all.
Well, it's just military psychology.
They always train you for the desert on a volcano.
Now you're just having fun with me.
Harlon, take your men right.
- Watch for Bedouins.
- Yes, sir.
- What's a Bedouin?
- It's a guy with a camel.
Well, Jeez Louise, maybe we are going to the desert.
Now, you tilt that to the right, but what if the bullet comes from the left?
Bullets don't come from the left.
You know any left-handed Japs?
That makes about as much sense as you showering with your shoes on.
You don't even know why you do it, do you?
'Cause I don't tell you mean I don't know?
You do it 'cause Mike does it.
I'll ask him.
So you cut hair back home?
Some.
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?
No, I just studied it a little.
But not in barber school?
Nope.
- Gosh.
- Let me guess, Hayes is winning.
Chief, I had very little to do with Sitting Bull's death, so maybe you could stop taking it out on me.
Different tribe.
The Pimas fought on the side of the white man.
- See, now that's smart.
- That is smart.
Yeah.
Worked real good for us.
Good luck, fellas.
Hey, good night, Lindberg.
Dead bodies.
He cuts hair on dead bodies.
What?
Even I knew that.
- Who's in?
- Oh, I'm in.
I'm in.
It must be a lot easier with them not moving around and all.
- There's that.
- Yeah.
You know what I been thinking?
Well, they been telling us we need to buddy up and I think we'd make pretty good buddies.
And how do you figure that?
Well, you know, in that we have a lot in common.
So, why do you cut dead people's hair, anyway?
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.
You tell a lot of people that?
You actually chose the Marines because they got the best uniform?
No sense being a hero if you don't look like one.
Jacks.
Queens.
Shit.
Do anything on that reservation but play cards, Chief?
All right, listen up, you sorry bunch of leathernecks!
We practice going over the side tomorrow which means we ain't long for this piece of rock.
All right!
One more thing, any man who doesn't have his masturbation papers in order better get them signed by tomorrow night or he ain't going overseas.
- I got mine already.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm square.
Wait.
Why am I just hearing about this?
That's horseshit, Franklin.
I don't have to repeat everything twice for you.
No, I didn't hear nothing about no masturbating papers.
Heard they were running short.
You know, nobody tells me nothing.
That's real nice, guys.
All right, get your ass over to the officer in charge of records.
Maybe he got some more left.
- Leave your smokes.
I'll play for you.
- Thanks, Mike.
Listen, he calls you an idiot, you take it like a man, okay?
Just do not leave without signing them.
- I appreciate it, Sergeant.
- You got it.
What the hell happened to your hair, Rene?
Look like a goddamn corpse.
Three points of contact on that rope at all times.
Next four.
Over the side.
Let's go.
Keep moving.
Next four, over the side.
Just keep your eye on the guy below you.
That's all you gotta look at.
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.
Keep three points of contact on the rope at all times.
You see?
No big thing.
Just one step at a time and keep your hands on the vertical rope.
Remember, once you're in the boat move away from the rope.
Just make sure you keep three points of contact on the rope.
I got him!
All right, get that man out of the water.
Give me a hand.
Grab his pack.
Don't worry about him, Doc.
All right, quit skylarking!
Keep it moving!
He'll be fine.
Our target, Island X, is an ugly, smelly, dirty little scab of rock called Iwo Jima.
It means "Sulfur Island," which accounts for the smell.
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop, you ask me.
After 20 straight days of bombing you won't find a blade of grass or a twig on it.
It wasn't that pretty to start with.
Captain?
Iwo's just five-and-a-half miles long, two-and-a-half wide.
There's a lump down at the bottom.
That's Mount Suribachi.
On the maps in front of you the island is white.
Not much of it.
The black dots represent known enemy emplacements.
Coastal defense guns, dual-mount dual-purpose guns, covered artillery emplacements.
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes, and earth-covered structures.
I don't see any barracks or any other structures.
That's right.
And we still don't know why.
Now, this isn't just any island to them.
This isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, or Saipan.
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders in eight square miles.
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.
It's up to us to convince them.
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.
The 8th Ammo Company will land here to re-supply.
The Suribachi's guns are the biggest problem.
They can hit any point on the island.
We're sitting ducks until we take them out.
That's our job.
We cut across the island, right at the base, slit its throat, lop off its head.
And we take that mountain.
We take that mountain, we take their big guns.
We take their eyes.
Okay, I'm heading in.
Follow me.
Let's put a good show on for the Marines.
Close it up.
Take it right down to the deck.
Yeah, boys!
Man overboard portside!
See him?
Throw me a line!
He's right there.
- Where is he?
- Watch out, watch out, watch out.
Hawaii's that way!
Just keep paddling, Mac, we'll catch you on the way back!
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!
They're not gonna stop.
What?
None of them are.
They can't.
So much for "No man left behind."
- Sir.
- Come on in.
Look, I've had to make a few other changes.
I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
- You bet.
Trouble is, I already told my men I'd see them through this.
That your James Cagney impersonation?
'Cause I've heard better.
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.
Look, this isn't your first time through this.
- You don't need to prove anything.
- No, sir.
You're not the best sergeant I've ever had, you're just the best one that's still walking.
- Block's a good man.
- Yes, sir, he is.
The men know him, he can step right in.
You know, I have actually thought this through.
Platoon sergeant puts you further away from the bullets.
I already gave them my word, sir.
I told them I'd bring them all home to their mothers which means I already lied to half of them.
Can't lie to the rest.
- How are your men?
- They'll do fine.
Except maybe Gagnon.
Our own Tyrone Power?
Yes, sir.
He's a good man, just might be better use further back from the lines.
I'll use him as a runner.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
Now get out of here.
Hear the good news, Doc?
We're going in with the first waves.
Hey, you do that again I'll take your head off!
Fucking dominoes.
Iggy, have you ever heard news you considered to be bad?
The first ones off the ship, Doc.
Means we don't go over the side of the ship.
We hop on a tractor, they drive us right there.
Oh, shit, that is good news.
You see?
What'd I tell you?
What's going on?
Look at that.
We're killing them!
We're killing them, Doc.
I was promised 10 days of shelling.
You're giving me three and saying that's the best you can do?
I don't give a shit!
My men hit that beach with less than 10 and I'll be taking them home to their mamas in buckets!
Yeah, I know exactly why.
Because every Navy man with a scrambled egg on his chest wants to offload us here and sail to Japan so they can be there for the big finish, tell their kids they captured the Emperor all by themselves.
Well, you aren't going to Japan unless we take this piece of shit island!
These little pricks are dug in!
Okay, appreciate that, Jim.
Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
I'm okay.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
Jesus, Iggy, just leave me alone, all right?
How about you guys?
Knife?
Bayonet?
Kick in the ass?
How about you, Doc?
Sharpen your knife?
You sharpened it three times already.
Well, then I better make sure I didn't nick it.
Good man, Doc.
- Hey, Doc.
- Yeah.
When we land, try not to wave this kit around too much.
They got sharpshooters that are trained to look for them.
And they know that if they take out a corpsman another dozen Marines will die unattended.
All right?
Okay, Mike.
Yeah, right there.
Close the damn door.
For God's sake.
Yeah, like that's gonna help.
That your girlfriend, Chief?
Bet she's a pretty damn good-looking squaw.
Bet you're missing her, and that little wigwam of yours.
Welcome, all Marines off Iwo Jima.
We have a long-time wait...
It's what they do to prisoners,
- at least the lucky ones.
- Jesus.
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think about waving a white bandanna.
Poor Marines, so far from home for no good reason.
Think of your girls back home, waiting for you.
But a girl cannot stay home every night.
So who do you think they're with tonight?
And will she let him kiss her?
And will he comfort her at your funeral?
This sweet music is to make you think of your girls back home who are missing you.
This is all for now.
I'll see you tomorrow night.
Gunners!
Move, let's go!
Let's go, get up on the berm!
Gunners!
We're clear!
Get up the berm!
Baker Company, move out!
- Seen Second Platoon?
- I don't see them.
First Squad, move it out!
God, this place reeks.
- Go, go, go!
- Move out!
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go!
Go!
Go, go!
Drop your packs!
Go!
All clear!
- Jesus, you needed some exercise?
- He got lost.
A hundred landing craft heading for one beach and this guy gets lost.
Now I'm glad we did.
Jesus, what a mess.
Any theories why they ain't shooting?
It's getting on my nerves.
Maybe they're all dead.
What do you think, Doc?
You think they're all dead?
Mike, take six men and bring that gun onto the beach.
Second Platoon, let's move out!
Stay down.
Come on.
Move!
Move!
- Get down!
- Take cover!
Move out!
Cover fire!
Pour it on!
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!
Corpsman!
I'm gonna sling your arm and then I'll give you a shot for the pain!
Move, move!
Off the beach!
Take cover!
You got a girl back home, Marine?
We're gonna make sure she sees you, all right?
I need pressure on this wound!
Where's the fire coming from?
Where are they?
Look for a flash, shoot at it!
Let's go, let...
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!
You're over!
Third Squad, forward!
Move!
Where are they, sir?
We got ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock, pillbox!
Sergeant!
- Sergeant!
I think I can clear that out.
- What?
All right, you go.
Here.
Take these.
Check your weapon.
Yeah?
Go!
Cover!
Cover him!
Cover, cover!
Son-of-a-bitch.
Let's go!
Go!
Move it out!
Go, go, go!
Down, down, down!
It's clear.
Good work.
I thought you said it was clear!
It was!
Shit, I guess they're not in there firing at us then.
Lindberg!
Yeah!
Light it up!
I'll cover you, Ice!
Don't cover shit!
There's already enough people shooting!
One bullet and this thing goes up like a Roman candle!
Go!
Shift fire!
Shift your fire!
Go, go!
Shift your fire!
Shift your fire!
Go!
Move it out!
Hit the deck!
Stay down!
Wait for support!
Is this a bad battle or what?
It's a fucking slaughter.
Christ Jesus!
Get a machine gun team set up over here, now!
Thank God!
Tanks!
Runner!
Get those tanks up here!
Oh, shit.
Get down!
Corporal, watch your left flank!
Let's go without them!
Move out!
Move out!
Iggy, you gotta lift your side, he's gonna roll off.
Got it, Doc!
Incoming!
Move, move, move, move!
Keep moving!
Get that LVT up on the beach!
Keep moving!
You're next, pal, we're getting you out of here.
Move it!
Great news.
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa, 'cause that's where we're headed.
Not you and me.
Captain Severance asked me who else was in that picture, and Christ if I could remember, but it was Mike and Doc and Franklin and me and Hank Hansen but I just remembered, you were there, too.
I wasn't there.
'Course you were.
Neither was Hank.
He raised the first flag.
It was Harlon Block that raised that one.
Shit.
I told them it was Hank.
You weren't there, Mr. Smart Ass, how'd you know it was Harlon?
- You tell them it was me?
- No.
Like I said, I just remembered.
Good, keep your mouth shut.
They know there was somebody else, you can see it in the picture.
Then pick someone dead.
They don't want somebody dead, you dumb redskin, they want to ship us back to the States.
What did I tell you?
I wasn't there.
- You hear?
- All right.
Just settle down.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're not going anywhere.
Who the hell says?
This is horseshit.
You wounded, son?
No, sir.
Well, did you take out a nest of Japs butt-naked with your bare hands?
'Cause if I'm gonna give up my seat to a hero he better have a good goddamn story to tell.
No, sir.
Then enjoy it, 'cause they'll forget you before Christmas.
The sixth man, you got a name?
Sorry, still don't remember.
It's a damn shame, 'cause I promised the Major you'd know who it was.
Fact, you not knowing throws a doubt on you being one of the flag-raisers yourself.
Since no one wants to be embarrassed, the moment you land they'll turn you around, ship you off to Okinawa in time to meet your buddies on the beach.
So, why don't you stop screwing with me?
Give me a damn name.
Gangway!
Gangway!
Let's go, let's go!
Gangway!
Where the hell is that son-of-a-bitch?
Hayes!
Hayes?
Hayes, get your red ass over here!
Make me look like I don't know what my own men are doing with a flag the size of my mother's house?
God damn it, Ira, you shouldn't have lied to me.
You made me look like a complete asshole.
We're gonna miss you around here.
Good luck.
Now your name's in the paper, too.
Just heard your doctor say we're postponing your operation.
You're being shipped back to the mainland.
Everybody who saw that picture thought planting the flag meant victory.
That's all they wanted to know.
Victory.
Within a few weeks of that picture being taken, half the men in it were dead.
Mrs. Hansen!
Mrs. Hansen!
Did you know Hank was a hero?
- Are you proud of him, Mrs. Hansen?
- What was he like as a boy?
Look this way, please, ma'am.
What do you have to say about your son?
But somehow being a part of it meant something.
Looking at it, you could believe their sacrifice was not a waste.
Yeah, I might have thought that was Harlon, too.
It is.
Belle, their names are right here.
It's not him.
And he would be alive and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.
You think about that when you look at his picture, Ed.
And I need to rush home and change because there's the Governor's banquet and then there's the parade.
Imagine, the Governor is coming here to meet us.
Now, I'm wearing blue so, if...
- Are you going to change?
- We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin from CBS World News.
A press association has just announced that President Roosevelt is dead.
The President died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
All we know so far is that the President died at Warm Springs in Georgia.
Further updates every hour.
Temperatures will remain the same today, in the mid-30s to low 40s with clear skies.
Hello?
Yes.
Of course.
No, we understand.
It wouldn't be right.
Thank you.
Here he is, gentlemen.
Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.
Senator Haddigan.
I'd like you to meet Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Damn good to meet you.
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.
Sorry?
That's Pima Indian talk, boy, don't you know your own language?
Took forever to memorize the damn gibberish.
Sorry, I've been away from the reservation too long, Senator.
- Doc.
- Ira.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
- That's you.
- Go, go, go, go.
Go.
Please welcome
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley,
Private First Class Ira Hayes,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon!
Holy shit.
Come in, come in, come in.
Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Bud Gurber.
- You showing the boys the sights?
- We saw a hell of a ball game.
That's great.
The bar's there, help yourself.
I got some briefing sheets for you here, just some simple things we want you to say.
Mostly, "Buy bonds," can't say that too often.
Itineraries, those are changing every couple minutes.
Everybody wants to meet you guys.
I got women sending up envelopes with stockings in them, notes written in lipstick.
We won't mention that to the press, am I right?
Have a drink, for Christ's sake.
My God, what you boys must have seen over there.
I've been watching the newsreels.
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.
So, we got a hell of a lot of money to raise, not a lot of time.
White House tomorrow, then we trot you over to shake hands with a couple of hundred Congressmen who won't pull a penny out of their pockets.
Politicians and actors.
You put them in a restaurant together, they'd die of old age before picking up the check.
Then New York City, Times Square, dinners with various hoi polloi, then Chicago...
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?
That's what we're calling the mothers of the dead flag-raisers.
You present each mother with a flag, they say a few words, people will shit money.
It'll be so moving.
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.
Lovely woman.
She knows how close you and her son were.
He wrote home about you.
She is very, very much looking forward to meeting you.
Hank wasn't in the picture.
Sorry?
Hank didn't raise that flag.
He raised the other one, the real flag.
The what?
The real...
The real flag?
There's a real flag?
Yeah, ours was the replacement flag.
We put it up when they took the other one down.
Am I the only one getting a headache here?
You know about this?
It was after it was already in the papers.
The mothers had already been told, Bud.
That's it, that's beautiful.
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Yeah, why tell me?
I'm only the guy that has to explain it to 150 million Americans.
Who is in the goddamn picture?
Are any of you guys in the goddamn picture?
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.
Six guys raising a flag over Iwo Jima.
Victory is ours.
You're three of them, right?
This was the fifth day, sir.
The battle went on for 35 more.
Well, what'd you do, raise a goddamn flag every time you stopped for lunch?
Can I hit this guy?
You know what, I don't give a shit, you're in the picture, you raised the flag, that's the story we're selling, boys.
Are you deaf?
Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?
Harlon Block.
That's whose mother should be here if anyone's should be.
You know, I think this whole damn thing is a farce, you ask me.
You know what they're calling this bond drive?
The Mighty Seventh.
They might've called it the
"We're Flat Fucking Broke And Can't Even Afford Bullets
"So We're Begging For Your Pennies" bond drive, but it didn't have quite the ring.
They could've called it that, though, because the last four bond drives came up so short we just printed money instead.
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street, he'll tell you our dollar is next to worthless, we borrowed so much.
And nobody is lending any more.
Ships aren't being built.
Tanks aren't being built.
Machine guns, bazookas, hand grenades, zip.
You think this is a farce?
You want to go back to your buddies?
Well, stuff some rocks in your pockets before you get on the plane because that's all we got left to throw at the Japanese.
And don't be surprised if your plane doesn't make it off the runway because the fuel dumps are empty.
And our good friends, the Arabs, are only taking bullion.
If we don't raise $14 billion, and that's million with a "B," this war is over by the end of the month.
We make a deal with the Japanese, we give whatever they want and we come home, because you've seen them fight, and they sure as shit ain't giving up.
$14 billion.
The last three drives didn't make that much all together.
People on the street corners, they looked at this picture and they took hope.
Don't ask me why, I think it's a crappy picture myself.
You can't even see your faces.
But it said we can win this war, are winning this war, we just need you to dig a little deeper.
They want to give us that money.
No, they want to give it to you.
But you, you don't want to ask for it.
You don't want to give them hope.
You want to explain about this person and that flag.
Well, that's your choice.
Because if we admit we made a mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about and that will be that.
Gentlemen.
Mr. President, here they are.
- Well, hello.
Good to see you.
- Mr. President.
Darn good to see you, boys.
Heard you had a hell of a fight on your hands out there, hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation in Arizona, am I right?
Yes, Mr. President.
Being an Indian, you are a truer American than any of us.
Bet your people are proud to see you wear that uniform.
Very proud, sir.
They should be.
Well, I want to thank you for coming all this way to Washington to help us out.
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific, now we need you to fight for a mountain of cash.
- And I don't expect you'll let us down.
- No, sir.
Good.
Go get it.
That's the end of this ceremony.
Let's take a look at this famous photo over here, see if I can pick you out.
My gosh.
There you are.
Boys.
Boys, this one's on me.
To those who can't be with us.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon.
May we have your autograph?
I suppose.
And your name is?
I don't know about you, but I get the impression
I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.
You're such a hero.
I feel honored to be in your presence.
That's just not true.
That's professional work.
Here, to professionals.
Here they are.
You're the guys in the photograph, right?
I heard you were on the train.
Let me shake your hands, John Tennack.
John Bradley.
These boys are with me, Harvard and Yale types, didn't fight a lick.
Pappies all rich sons-of-bitches.
Boys, shake hands with some real war heroes.
Excuse me for one moment.
You can buy them a drink while you're at it.
That's right.
Drinks for these men all the way around.
And you're the other one, aren't you?
John Tennack, Tennack Homes.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Pleased to meet you.
Have a drink, come on.
And here's my card.
Listen to me, Rene, when you get finished being famous you come see me because if you can sell bonds, you can sell homes.
Now, they're not gonna build homes anymore, they're gonna deliver them.
- You heard of prefab homes?
- No, sir.
Well, you will.
And you hang on to that card and you come see me, you hear?
- All right?
- Certainly will.
All right.
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?
If Mike and the guys could see us.
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it, would they?
Harlon!
Franklin!
Can you imagine Franklin on this train
eating at the dining car with all the silver?
We shouldn't be here, Doc.
There's gonna be a Hallelujah Day
When the boys have all come home to stay
And a million bands begin to play
We'll be dancing the Vict'ry Polka
And when we've lit the torch of liberty
In each blacked-out land across the sea
Ira!
Hey, Ira!
We heard the picture was posed!
What?
We heard you posed the picture!
Hey, Doc!
We're bigger than life, Doc!
And we'll heave a mighty sigh
When each gal can kiss the boy she kissed goodbye
And they'll come marching down Fifth Avenue
The United Nations in review
When this lovely dream has all come true
We'll be dancing the Vict'ry Polka
Good job.
Thank you.
Thank you, girls!
And now, here are the men you've been waiting to meet, the men in white.
Right behind me here, the heroes of Iwo Jima,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon,
Private First Class Ira Hayes, and Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley!
Thank you.
It's good of you people to come out tonight in support of the war effort.
We really need you to buy bonds, that's for sure.
'Cause we can't win the war without your help.
As far as us being the heroes of Iwo Jima, that's just not the case.
We really didn't do much at all.
Especially him.
Especially me.
I was just a runner.
That's it.
We put up a flag.
The pole we attached it to was heavy, so it took a number of us.
We had our picture taken doing it.
The real heroes are dead on that island.
And we'd appreciate it if you bought bonds in honor of them.
Thank you.
Jump on any grenades, Ira?
Take out any machine gun nests I missed?
At least I fired my weapon.
All right, knock it off.
You hit anything or were you too drunk then, too?
What?
Guys!
Come on!
Stop it.
Knock it off.
The tall man with the high hat will be coming down your way
Get your savings out when you hear him shout
"Any bonds today?"
Any bonds today?
Bonds of freedom that's what I'm selling
Any bonds today?
Rene, right here.
Sit between these two boys.
Here comes the freedom man
Asking you to buy a share of freedom today ...for us and they need our help.
And, if you think about it, I think you'll realize that buying more bonds is not just the right thing to do but the only thing to do.
Yes, this war has gone on too long.
We have given too many lives.
And its cost...
- Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
- Strawberry.
...has been far too high.
But if we waver now, if we don't dig deep and give more than we think we can then those sacrifices would be wasted...
Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
...and those lives lost in vain.
Let's move!
Go, go!
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over.
Where the hell are our tanks?
Stuck in the sand.
Captain says you're to go without them.
Christ.
That's real good work you're doing there, Rene.
All right, prepare to move out.
Pass the word.
Second Platoon!
Move!
Move!
Move!
All right, Second Platoon, on your feet!
Let's move out!
Jackass.
Let's move out!
Go, go!
Move, move, move!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Second Platoon, move out!
Doc!
Doc, get out of there!
Corpsman!
Doc!
Doc, get the hell out of there!
May I have your attention, please.
Train number 48 with service from New York City, Boston,
Rochester, New York,
Toledo, Ohio, and South Bend, Indiana is now arriving on Track 7.
Train number 48 now arriving on Track number 7.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.
- Come on, boys.
- Let's go.
- Watch your step, ma'am.
- Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the heroes of Iwo Jima.
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.
Private First Class Ira Hayes.
And Private First Class Rene Gagnon.
Rene!
That's my boyfriend!
Who the hell is that?
I don't know.
- Rene, is that your girl?
- Hey, what do they call you?
How about a photo?
Hey, look at that!
What's your name, doll?
What's your name?
Hey, she's a beauty.
Let's go find a saloon.
Smile, boys.
Give them their money's worth.
Hey, Doc, how's the tour going for you?
Thank you.
Where exactly are you staying?
- I'm not sure yet.
- Just forget about that.
Senator, I'd like you to meet Corpsman John Bradley.
- Doc, right?
- Yes, sir.
Nice to meet you, Senator.
Good to meet you, young man.
Now, we appreciate everything you've done and everything you're doing.
- Thank you, sir.
- Quite all right.
This is Captain White.
- Colonel Johns.
- We're proud of you, Corpsman.
And then Colonel McCourtney.
- Major General Green.
- Nice to meet you.
Senator, this is Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Of course!
Now I hear you used a tomahawk on those Japs.
Is that true, Chief?
No, sir.
Well, tell them you did, makes a better story, huh?
- Attaboy.
- This is Captain Green.
John?
Madeline Evelley.
I recognize you from all the photographs.
I'm Hank's mom.
It's so nice to meet you, ma'am.
Hank was always talking about you.
This is PFC Rene Gagnon.
Pleasure to meet you, son.
Thanks for everything.
- My pleasure.
- Not at all.
Ira, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Strank, Mike's mom.
It's all right.
When I got the telegram, I...
I don't know what I'm trying to say here.
Knowing he was with you that day and seeing him in that photograph,
I don't know why it makes me feel better, but it does.
- It's so silly, isn't it?
- No, it's not.
How are you, son?
Thank you very much.
We're the largest furniture wholesaler in Illinois.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
- I'll make sure he calls.
- Well, thank you.
Thank you.
Are you Rene?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Franklin's mother.
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.
I'm Pauline, Rene's girlfriend.
Would you mind?
Paper said that's Hank, and I honestly can't tell.
It's horrible of a mother not to know her own son, isn't it?
But that's him, isn't it?
Well, to be honest, ma'am, it happened so quick, and with everything that was going on it's kind of hard to remember who was where.
But...
Yeah, I think...
I think that's where he was.
That's Hank.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Excuse us.
Take him outside.
I'm Pauline.
- Very nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
He was the best Marine I ever knew.
Thank you.
- You okay, Chief?
- Oh, Christ!
I'm okay.
Yeah, you look it.
You're gonna screw this up, aren't you?
You're gonna screw it up for all of us.
I've got him.
Get some sleep, Ira.
- Mike?
- Yeah?
- You see this?
- What?
- Mike!
- Oh, shit, go!
He's killing me!
Hey, Doc, you think they got them all?
What?
Well, they're not shooting at us.
Maybe we killed them all.
Or they ran off in the night or something.
Or they're waiting for us to start climbing.
Third Platoon!
Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.
- Just us?
- Yeah, just us, Igg.
All right, Third Platoon, move!
I tag along?
Yeah, you can lead the way if you want.
Get a good shot of my face.
It's your ass I'm gonna make famous, Hank.
Hey, that'll work for me, too.
Lieutenant, if you make it to the top, put this up.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, Iggy.
They never shoot at the first patrol.
- They don't?
- No.
They want us to go up to the top, signal to the others that it's okay, then shoot everybody else as they come up the mountain.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Unless of course they want to make an example of us and discourage all the others.
I think you're full of crap, you know that, Hank?
Really?
Jesus.
Thank God that ain't us.
Told you.
Boots, spread them out and put them on a line.
Set up a perimeter!
First Squad!
- Hank?
Find me a pole.
- Yeah.
Let's put this flag up.
Watch it.
Right over here.
Right here.
That's good.
That's good.
Right here, right here.
Got that end?
Hold that steady.
Lindberg.
- Hey, who's got rope?
- Right here.
Give me something.
Yeah, good.
That work?
Do it, fellas.
Keep it coming.
USMC!
USMC!
Shit, look at that!
Jeez, look at that.
Get down!
Take cover!
Cover with that .30!
- Watch it!
Twenty yards down, Hank!
- You see them?
- I got about 20 yards, left side.
- Lindberg, get the flamethrower!
- Boots, you see them?
- Cover right!
- About 20 yards down!
Duck one!
- You see them?
Keep the cover on!
Second Squad, you see them?
Get me some grenades!
I see them!
You see them?
Right flank, over to the right!
Cover me, I'm going down!
Careful, Iggy.
Easy.
All clear!
Okay, guys, who wants to be famous?
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
- God damn it.
Strank!
- Sir?
They want a phone line run up to the top of the mountain.
Let me guess, they picked us.
Second Platoon, let's go.
Get some exercise.
Let's go!
Get off your ass.
Oh, shit!
Hope it still works, 'cause you're not getting mine!
- Get Forrestal!
- All right, then.
I don't know whose idea it was, Mr. Secretary.
Well, it was goddamn brilliant.
I want that flag, Holland.
Mark my words, raising that son-of-a-bitch means a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.
I want that flag.
Yes, sir.
I'll make sure no one touches it.
You can count on me.
Fuck that.
That flag belongs to the men in this battalion.
That son-of-a-bitch thinks that our men died taking this ground so we could hand over our flag to some politician to pin to his wall?
He's out of his goddamn mind!
Get me that flag, and find another one to replace it.
You've gotta be shitting me.
Gagnon!
Get your ass over here.
Hey.
Hi, fellas.
How's it going?
Missed a beautiful shot, Joe.
It's that kind of day.
- Hey, Mike.
- Hell of a view, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant!
Captain says he wants that flag.
He wants this flag?
Yes, sir.
- We just put the damn thing up.
- Yes, sir.
Some kind of flag shortage?
He wants you to put this one up instead.
Hey, Mike.
Do me a favor and put this up, will you?
Yes, sir.
All right, let's find a pole.
Take the flag down, boys.
Captain's orders.
You heard him, let's do it.
There you go.
Lordy, she's a heavy one.
All right, hang on.
Put this on.
One hell of a view, huh?
Good view from up here.
Yes, I'd say so myself.
All right.
- Not in your way here, am I, Joe?
- Nah, I'm fine, thanks.
Hey, Doc, you wanna give us a hand here?
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.
Ready?
Ready?
Let's go.
You get it?
I don't know.
I wish I could've seen their faces.
Nobody even noticed that second flag going up.
Everybody saw that damn picture and made up their own story about it.
But your dad and the others knew what they had done and what they had not done.
All your friends dying, it's hard not to be called a hero for saving somebody's life.
But for putting up a pole?
You gotta be kidding.
Hey!
It took a lot of talented folks a long time to make that thing.
Just wait till tonight when it's lit properly and there's thousands of cheering people in the stands.
It's gonna look a lot better.
So, stadium lights come down, spotlight comes up and you get your cue.
You charge up this thing with the flag, you plant it at the top.
You smile, you wave.
You know the drill.
You want us to plant the flag on a pile of papier-mâché.
Hey, that's show biz.
And try and stand how you stood the first time you planted it.
Just, you know, pretend the other three guys are with you.
The dead guys.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, not a problem.
Good.
But where do we imagine Hank is standing?
Sorry?
Well, seeing that he wasn't there, it'll be kind of hard for us to leave a space for him.
I think you know exactly where he was.
You pointed him out to his mother.
This is bullshit.
I planted that damn thing once, and I'm not doing it again.
- Hayes!
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
Hayes.
Hayes, get your ass back here or you're going on report.
Hayes!
You wanna do your damn job?
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Come on!
He's with me!
Hey, he's with me!
- Back off!
- Sir, he's with me.
Okay?
He's with me.
Ira, put the goddamn chair down!
- Put the chair down, son!
- Put the chair down, Ira!
Tell them drop their sticks!
Ira, they're cops, they're supposed to have nightsticks.
You're not supposed to be in the street swinging a chair.
- Calm down, son.
- Sir, turn around, please.
That poster right there?
The one on the end, that's him.
- That's him?
- Yes, sir.
You read the papers?
Christ.
We got another fucking hero.
Get him out of here.
- Can you do that?
- Yes, sir.
Put the goddamn chair down.
And let's go.
Did you start this?
He didn't serve me!
I don't make the rules.
We don't serve Indians.
He needs to go sleep it off.
Soldier Field.
You hear that?
What the hell is that?
I can't figure it out.
Keep an eye out.
It sounds like it's coming from up there.
They're using grenades.
They're killing themselves.
Ira, let's go.
Come on.
Let's go, Ira.
Come on.
Thank God.
Jesus.
Look at you, Chief.
You found him.
Holy shit.
You would have to pick today.
Vandegrift is here with enough brass to start a fucking band.
Come on, let's go.
Can you walk?
- Yes, sir.
- By yourself?
All right, look.
I don't care if you have to carry him get him to the top, plant that flag, and don't fucking fall off.
Get him in his stuff.
I'll stall these guys for as long as I can.
Hurry up.
Jesus Christ.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Cover!
Harlon!
Harlon!
Get your fire team up in that position!
O'Hare!
First Fire Team!
Work around!
BAR, you, on the side of the ridge!
Covering fire, boys, go, go, go!
Jackson, work your team around to the left!
Cover!
Left flank!
Left flank!
Franklin, Gust, go check it out!
Hustle up, boys!
We got them!
Clear!
One hell of an experience.
Move out!
Cease fire!
They're my men!
You're targeting our men!
You're targeting our...
Get me another radio!
Sergeant?
Sergeant!
Mike!
Mike, Mike, Mike.
Mike?
Mike.
Hey, where's Doc?
Corpsman!
Oh, shit.
How's his breathing?
Harlon, move, buddy.
Hey, Mike.
Mike, Mike, can you hear us?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on, Mike.
Mike?
Mike, can you hear us?
All right, let's go!
Move out!
I'm gonna get a stretcher.
Let's take him down, move him off the beach.
Ladies and gentlemen, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Corpsman!
Hank!
Hank!
Doc, they killed me.
Harlon!
Doc, they killed me.
Come on, Harlon.
Harlon, stay with me.
Franklin!
I'm fine, Ira.
Corpsman!
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Does it open?
Iggy!
Iggy!
Iggy, are you down there?
Iggy!
Can't tell who it is, but he's one of ours.
I had to go outside to throw up.
Look what they did to the poor son-of-a-bitch.
You okay, Chief?
Just let it go.
If that doesn't pry open their wallets, nothing will.
Jesus Christ, he's drunk.
Goddamn Indians.
Come on, Chief.
Let's get you home.
That's not what I hear.
I called around, I'm not stupid.
He's been drunk since he started this damn tour, making a spectacle of himself.
Just about choked that poor woman at the reception, blubbering.
Jesus Christ, you're supposed to be watching these men.
Yes, sir.
Well, he's making us look like regular asses.
Well, with all due respect, sir, he never wanted to come on this trip in the first place.
We had to pull him, kicking and screaming, off that boat.
He wants to be with his unit.
What unit?
They're all fucking dead.
This is how he honors those men?
By drinking and throwing up, and...
You know what?
He wants it, great, we'll send him back.
Get him packed and on a train today.
He's an embarrassment to the uniform.
Yes, sir.
I'll do it.
Yeah, no, that's...
That's good.
That's what I want.
I know it's a good thing, raising the money and that, 'cause we need it.
But,
I can't take them calling me a hero.
All I did was try not to get shot.
Some of the things I saw done, things I did,
they weren't things to be proud of, you know?
Mike...
Mike was a hero.
You ever meet him?
No.
Best Marine I ever met.
You know, Chief, I think if Mike was sitting here instead of you he'd be saying the same thing about himself,
not being a hero.
Maybe.
He was a good guy.
But I think that he would be ashamed of me, seeing me the way I am.
Think I could see my ma before they ship me off?
Think they'd do that?
See my ma?
I'm sorry, Ira.
We got stories now to tell our kids, I guess.
Keep your head down.
All aboard.
Good luck, Chief.
I think I saw him once after that.
It was maybe six or seven years after the war.
I was working as a salesman, doing a lot of driving.
I was driving west across Texas.
I was just trying to get where I was going so I could get home.
And I saw this guy hitchhiking on the side of the road.
And, for a second, I thought it might've been him.
I always regret that I didn't stop, but I was in a hurry.
And he was an Indian.
We always told the press that Ira insisted that he was going back to fight with his unit which was at least partially true, but
that isn't what got the headlines.
We're engaged.
Excuse me a minute, darling.
- Hey, Doc?
- Yeah?
- Got a minute?
- Yeah.
I'll see you at the car.
- You hear I'm getting married?
- I did, Rene.
That's great.
Yeah, it's something she wants.
She waited for me all this time.
She's not used to all this, but she's a good girl.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
So, I was wondering if you'd be my best man.
Me?
Don't you have somebody at home, a buddy, you'd rather ask?
Well, I didn't really make many.
The ones who didn't go, it's...
Well, it's hard to even talk to them.
You know?
Yeah, I know.
I'd be proud to.
Thank you.
I better go drag her away from them before she announces
I'm gonna be president of General Motors or something.
All right.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Rene, you're a lucky man.
- Big smile, Mrs. Gagnon!
- Say cheese!
I couldn't complain because the press loved them, so they wrote more articles and people bought more bonds.
The tour went on with just Rene and your dad.
And the true heroes are the men who didn't make it home from Iwo Jima, the men who died at Iwo Jima and in other campaigns.
We ask that you honor the memory of those men by buying the war bonds and helping us to win this war.
Thank you.
City after city, I thought the damn thing'd never end.
And this rumor kept going around that the photograph had been staged.
I remember your dad telling them that he wished he'd known he was having his picture taken because he would've ducked the hell out of it.
Whose idea was it?
Who wanted to stage the thing?
Come on, it was you?
Was there truth to the rumor that that picture was staged, Doc?
- Come on!
Doc?
- Can you answer that?
I remember when your dad got shot.
All hell was busting loose.
People back home saw that picture and thought it was over when we took Suribachi.
We wished.
Anyways, we're pinned down.
Mortars, shells, machine guns.
Fire coming from every which direction, right?
And we hear somebody call, "Corpsman down."
Corpsman down!
Blood was spurting out of his throat, and Doc was doing everything he could.
And the Corpsman looks up at him and he knows what this means, to be shot in the neck.
He knows he's dying, you can see that.
But still in his eyes, he's pleading with Doc to save his life.
And Doc can't.
- You okay, Doc?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah, you look fine.
- I'm okay.
Keep down, all right?
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.
Okay.
Corpsman.
Corpsman!
For God sake, Corpsman!
Corpsman?
Corpsman.
Incoming!
Let me see.
It's not that bad.
You're gonna be okay.
All right?
Just stay with me.
Look at me.
Took us a half-hour to find your dad.
He could've bled to death.
Coming down.
Thanks.
Vets'll tell you about being hit but not wanting to leave their buddies.
Usually, they're lying.
You'll take any excuse to get out of there.
But it happens.
You get the feeling you're letting them down.
I could see that in your dad's face.
He wanted to go, he'd seen enough.
But he didn't want to leave us.
Now, he was a hell of a good man, your dad.
Yeah.
While we were sitting there on the beach, we heard this great roar.
And we looked up.
That was the first of thousands of landings on Iwo.
- Look at that.
- Yeah.
How about that.
I'm gonna head back, all right?
Good luck.
That island saved a lot of lives.
A lot of lives.
I don't know what else to tell you.
After the bond tour my dad finally got his operation.
By the time he got home the war was over.
First thing he did was ask my mom to marry him.
Ira tried to get on with his life and put it all behind him.
Thank you for having me here today.
It's an honor to be in front of such a strong people.
Because of the war white men will understand Indians a lot better.
And it's going to be a better world.
But life had other plans for him.
You're...
You're him, aren't you?
You're the hero, right?
Great.
All right, kids, go get your picture taken.
Oh, that's great.
That's great.
All right, now say cheese.
Cheese!
That's great!
Okay.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Thanks.
- Come on.
- That's a hero, kids.
Hero, lift this basket, will you?
It's too heavy for me.
Rene tried to take advantage of those offers he'd received on the bond tour.
Yes.
G-A-G-N-O-N.
Right.
Pronounced Rene.
Rene, yes.
- Okay, I actually called last week.
- Yes.
Okay, yes.
Mr. Gagnon.
I gave Mr. Tennack your message.
I'm sure he'll call you.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
But he was yesterday's hero.
He even applied for a job at the local police station.
They said he wasn't qualified.
After working the factory with Pauline he tried a few things but spent the rest of his life as a janitor.
But Ira...
Ira!
You got a visitor.
Ira always made the news.
I could never find out why he did it, but one day Ira just took off.
He walked and hitched over 1,300 miles from Arizona to Texas.
He found Harlon Block's father working his field.
His wife, Belle, had left him soon after they discovered Harlon died.
She never forgave him for letting her son go off to war.
And Ira told him the truth, that it had been his son who raised the flag with them, his son in the photograph.
And then he just turned and walked away.
Though the flag-raising meant nothing to him, he somehow knew it would mean everything to them.
Thanks for calling.
Just as Belle knew all along.
The press soon found out and called Hank's mom with the news that it wasn't her son after all.
The last time they all saw each other was at the unveiling of the Marine Corps War Memorial.
And even though he planted the first flag above Iwo Jima,
Hank's mother and father weren't invited.
Ira.
It's good to see you, Ira.
Hell of a statue.
It wasn't long after that that they found Ira.
The papers said he died of exposure.
There was no autopsy.
It was about that same time when my father got in his car early one morning telling my mom he had something to do.
He drove to a town on the other side of Wisconsin where Iggy's mom lived.
Ever since she heard the news about her son she'd been trying to find out how he died, and no one would tell her.
I never found out what he told her, but I can pretty much guarantee it wasn't the truth.
My mother would ask him what was troubling him.
He would never say.
And every year, as it got close to Memorial Day, the reporters would start calling asking to interview my father.
No, I'm sorry.
He's fishing in Canada.
We were always instructed to say the same thing.
Okay.
Thanks.
When Mr. McCandless retired, my father bought the funeral home where he'd worked since coming home.
He spent the rest of his life running the business and raising his family.
He never spoke about the war or about the flag-raising, never told us anything.
The first time I heard any of these stories was after he died.
Where is he?
Oh, God.
He's not here, Dad.
He died.
Who?
Who died?
Iggy.
Iggy.
Christ, poor Iggy.
I hadn't thought of him for years.
How do you know about Iggy?
You were calling for him, when you collapsed.
I wasn't looking for Iggy.
I was looking for you.
I wanted to...
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry I wasn't a better father.
Talked to you more.
I just...
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
You were the best father a man could have.
Did I ever tell you they took us swimming?
No, Dad.
After we planted the flag, we came down off the mountain and they let us swim.
It was the funniest thing.
All this fighting and we were jumping around in the water like kids.
That's the way I remember Iggy now.
I finally came to the conclusion that maybe he was right.
Maybe there's no such thing as heroes.
Maybe there are just people like my dad.
I finally came to understand why they were so uncomfortable being called heroes.
Heroes are something we create, something we need.
It's a way for us to understand what is almost incomprehensible, how people could sacrifice so much for us.
But for my dad and these men, the risks they took, the wounds they suffered, they did that for their buddies.
They may have fought for their country, but they died for their friends.
For the man in front, for the man beside them.
And if we wish to truly honor these men, we should remember them the way they really were, the way my dad remembered them.
Come on, Doc!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
For God sakes!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Honey, what's wrong?
Every jackass thinks he knows what war is.
Especially those who've never been in one.
We like things nice and simple... good and evil, heroes and villains.
There's always plenty of both.
Most of the time, they are not who we think they are.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where... where is he?
Where is he?
Mr. Bradley?
Mr. B?
You okay?
Where is he?
Where is who?
Where is he?
Where did he go?
Where... where is he?
All right.
Just stay right here, okay?
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
Just... it'll be okay.
Where is he?
Most guys I knew would never talk about what happened over there.
Probably 'cause they're still trying to forget about it.
They certainly didn't think of themselves as heroes.
They died without glory.
Nobody has taken their pictures.
Only their buddies knew what they did.
I'd tell their folks they died for their country.
I'm not sure that was it.
Now, there were plenty other photos taken that day... but none anybody wanted to see.
What we see and do in war... the cruelty, is unbelievable.
But somehow we gotta make some sense of it.
To do that, we need a easy way to understand truth... and damn few words.
Film's ruined.
I don't know.
This one looks all right.
And if you can get a picture...
Now, the right picture can win or lose a war.
You're gonna want to see this.
Look at Vietnam.
The picture of that South Vietnamese officer... blowing that fella's brains out of the side of his head, whammo!
That was it.
The war was lost.
We just hung around trying to pretend it wasn't.
Took a lot of other pictures that day.
None of them made a difference.
Thanks.
Appreciate it.
Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.
Country was bankrupt.
People were becoming cynical and tired of war.
Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon!
Where?
Right there.
Planting that flag, that's your brother.
Ma, all you can see is his behind.
And that's his.
I powdered and diapered it, I know my son.
That's him.
Go get your father.
Daddy, Ma's got a picture of Harlon's keister in the paper.
You watch your mouth, young man.
Thank you.
One photo, almost all on its own, turned that around.
It's on the front page of every major paper.
Over 200 dailies and they're all flooded with requests for prints.
I think we might have found it.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
I gotta go get him.
Oh, no, you don't.
Iggy, I gotta go.
I have a whole different theory.
He wants medical attention bad enough, he'll come to us.
Shut up and crawl over here, you lazy son-of-a-bitch!
As soon as that flare goes out.
Crap.
Okay, well, I'll go with you.
No.
You're actually gonna leave me, here?
I'll be right back, just shoot some people.
I gotta go.
Oh, God.
Okay, it's okay.
Don't touch them.
Don't touch them.
Get your hands out of there.
Let me do that.
I'll do it, okay?
Don't look.
Keep your head back.
Keep your eyes on me.
All right, look at me.
I'll get it, I'll take care of it.
We'll get this bandage on you.
We'll get you taken care of.
And we'll get you down to the bottom, all right?
Look, you're gonna be fine.
It's okay.
I'll do that.
I'll do that.
Here, put some pressure on that.
Put your hands on top and put some pressure on it.
Keep your head back.
Keep breathing.
Keep looking at me, all right?
Just keep looking at...
Doc.
Help me.
Help me.
All right.
Okay.
How's that feel?
It feels good.
It does?
All right.
Good.
All right.
I'm gonna go get a stretcher and get you down to the beach.
I'll be right back.
I'm all right.
Go and help someone who's hurt.
All right.
Hold on there.
Where'd he go?
Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Holy shit.
They expect us to climb this?
Or something just like it.
So, where you think they're sending us?
I think it's the desert, Franklin.
Well, that makes no sense at all.
Well, it's just military psychology.
They always train you for the desert on a volcano.
Now you're just having fun with me.
Harlon, take your men right.
Watch for Bedouins.
Yes, sir.
What's a Bedouin?
It's a guy with a camel.
Well, Jeez Louise, maybe we are going to the desert.
Now, you tilt that to the right... but what if the bullet comes from the left?
Bullets don't come from the left.
You know any left-handed Japs?
That makes about as much sense as you showering with your shoes on.
You don't even know why you do it, do you?
'Cause I don't tell you, mean I don't know?
You do it 'cause Mike does it.
I'll ask him.
So, you cut hair back home?
Some.
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?
No, I just studied it a little.
But not in barber school?
Nope.
Gosh.
Let me guess, Hayes is winning.
Chief, I had very little to do with Sitting Bull's death... so maybe you could stop taking it out on me.
Different tribe.
The Pimas fought on the side of the white man.
See, now that's smart.
That is smart.
Yeah.
Worked real good for us.
Good luck, fellas.
Hey, good night, Lindberg.
Dead bodies.
He cuts hair on dead bodies.
What?
Even I knew that.
Who's in?
Oh, I'm in.
I'm in.
It must be a lot easier with them not moving around and all.
There's that.
Yeah.
You know what I been thinking?
Well, they been telling us we need to buddy up and I think we'd make pretty good buddies.
And how do you figure that?
Well, you know, in that we have a lot in common.
So, why do you cut dead people's hair, anyway?
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.
You tell a lot of people that?
You actually chose the Marines because they got the best uniform?
No sense being a hero if you don't look like one.
Jacks.
Queens.
Shit.
Do anything on that reservation but play cards, Chief?
All right, listen up, you sorry bunch of leathernecks!
We practice going over the side tomorrow... which means we ain't long for this piece of rock.
All right!
One more thing, any man who doesn't have his masturbation... papers in order... better get them signed by tomorrow night, or he ain't going overseas.
I got mine, already.
Oh, yeah.
I'm square.
Wait.
Why am I just hearing about this?
That's horseshit, Franklin.
I don't have to repeat everything twice for you.
No, I didn't hear nothing about no masturbating papers.
Heard they were running short.
You know, nobody tells me nothing.
That's real nice, guys.
All right, get your ass over to the officer in charge of records.
Maybe he got some more left.
Leave your smokes.
I'll play for you.
Thanks, Mike.
Listen, he calls you an idiot, you take it like a man, okay?
Just do not leave without signing them.
I appreciate it, Sergeant.
You got it.
What the hell happened to your hair, Rene?
Look like a goddamn corpse.
Three points of contact on that rope at all times.
Next four.
Over the side.
Let's go.
Keep moving.
Next four, over the side.
Just keep your eye on the guy below you.
That's all you gotta look at.
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.
Keep three points of contact on the rope at all times.
You see?
No big thing.
Just one step at a time and keep your hands on the vertical rope.
Remember, once you're in the boat move away from the rope.
Just make sure you keep three points of contact on the rope.
I got him!
All right, get that man out of the water.
Give me a hand.
Grab his pack.
Don't worry about him, Doc.
All right, quit skylarking!
Keep it moving!
He'll be fine.
Our target, Island X... is an ugly, smelly, dirty little scab of rock called Iwo Jima.
It means "Sulfur Island," which accounts for the smell.
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop, if you ask me.
After twenty straight days of bombing... you won't find a blade of grass or a twig on it.
It wasn't that pretty, to start with.
Captain?
Iwo's just five and-a-half miles long, two and-a-half wide.
There's a lump down at the bottom.
That's Mount Suribachi.
On the maps in front of you, the island is white.
Not much of it.
The black dots represent known enemy emplacements.
Coastal defense guns, dual-mount dual-purpose guns... covered artillery emplacements.
Rifle pits, foxholes, anti-tank guns... machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes... and earth-covered structures.
I don't see any barracks, or any other structures.
That's right.
And we still don't know why.
Now, this isn't just any island to them.
This isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, or Saipan.
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders in eight square miles.
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.
It's up to us to convince them.
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.
The 8th Ammo Company will land here to re-supply.
The Suribachi's guns are the biggest problem.
They can hit any point on the island.
We're sitting ducks until we take them out.
That's our job.
We cut across the island, right at the base, slit its throat... lop off its head.
And we take that mountain.
We take that mountain, we take their big guns.
We take their eyes.
Okay, I'm heading in.
Follow me.
Let's put a good show on for the Marines.
Close it up.
Take it right down to the deck.
Yeah, boys!
Man overboard, portside!
See him?
Throw me a line!
He's right there.
Where is he?
Watch out, watch out, watch out.
Hawaii's that way!
Just keep paddling, Mac, we'll catch you on the way back!
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!
They're not gonna stop.
What?
None of them are.
They can't.
So much for "No man left behind."
Sir.
Come on in.
Look, I've had to make a few other changes.
I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.
Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
You bet.
Trouble is, I already told my men I'd see them through this.
That your James Cagney impersonation?
'Cause I've heard better.
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.
Look, this isn't your first time through this.
You don't need to prove anything.
No, sir.
You're not the best sergeant I've ever had... you're just the best one that's still walking.
Block's a good man.
Yes, sir, he is.
The men know him, he can step right in.
You know, I have actually thought this through.
Platoon sergeant puts you further away from the bullets.
I already gave them my word, sir.
I told them I'd bring them all home to their mothers... which means I already lied to half of them.
Can't lie to the rest.
How are your men?
They'll do fine.
Except maybe Gagnon.
Our own Tyrone Power?
Yes, sir.
He's a good man, just might be better use... further back from the lines.
I'll use him as a runner.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
Now get out of here.
Hear the good news, Doc?
We're going in with the first waves.
Hey, you do that again, I'll take your head off!
Fucking dominoes.
Iggy, have you ever heard news you considered to be bad?
The first ones off the ship, Doc.
Means we don't go over the side of the ship.
We hop on a tractor, they drive us right there.
Oh, shit, that is good news.
You see?
What'd I tell you?
What's going on?
Look at that.
We're killing them!
We're killing them, Doc.
I was promised ten days of shelling.
You're giving me three... and say that's the best you can do?
I don't give a shit!
My men hit that beach with less than ten... and I'll be taking them home to their mamas in buckets!
Yeah, I know exactly why.
Because every Navy man with a scrambled egg on his chest... wants to offload us here and sail to Japan... so they can be there for the big finish... tell their kids they captured the Emperor all by themselves.
Well, you aren't going to Japan... unless we take this piece of shit island!
These little pricks are dug in!
Okay, appreciate that, Jim.
Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.
Sharpen your knife, or bayonet?
I'm okay.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
Jesus, Iggy, just leave me alone, all right?
How about you guys?
Knife?
Bayonet?
Kick in the ass?
How about you, Doc?
Sharpen your knife?
You sharpened it three times, already.
Well, then I better make sure I didn't nick it.
Good man, Doc.
Hey, Doc.
Yeah.
When we land, try not to wave this kit around too much.
They got sharpshooters that are trained to look for them.
And they know that if they take out a corpsman... another dozen Marines will die unattended.
All right?
Okay, Mike.
Yeah, right there.
Close the damn door.
For God's sake.
Yeah, like that's gonna help.
That your girlfriend, Chief?
Bet she's a pretty damn good-looking squaw.
Bet you're missing her, and that little wigwam of yours.
Welcome, all Marines off Iwo Jima.
We have a long-time wait...
It's what they do to prisoners... at least the lucky ones.
Jesus.
If I were you, cowpokes...
I wouldn't think about waving a white bandanna.
Poor Marines, so far from home for no good reason.
Think of your girls back home, waiting for you.
But a girl cannot stay home every night.
So, who do you think they're with, tonight?
And will she let him kiss her?
And will he comfort her at your funeral?
This sweet music is to make you think of your girls back home... who are missing you.
This is all, for now.
I'll see you tomorrow night.
Gunners!
Move, let's go!
Let's go, get up on the berm!
Gunners!
We're clear!
Get up the berm!
Baker Company, move out!
Seen Second Platoon?
I don't see them.
First Squad, move it out!
God, this place reeks.
Go, go, go!
Move out!
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go!
Go!
Go, go!
Drop your packs!
Go!
All clear!
Jesus, you needed some exercise?
He got lost.
A hundred landing craft heading for one beach... and this guy gets lost.
Now I'm glad we did.
Jesus, what a mess.
Any theories why they ain't shooting?
It's getting on my nerves.
Maybe they're all dead.
What do you think, Doc?
You think they're all dead?
Mike, take six men and bring that gun onto the beach.
Second Platoon, let's move out!
Stay down.
Come on.
Move!
Move!
Get down!
Take cover!
Move out!
Cover fire!
Pour it on!
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!
Corpsman!
I'm gonna sling your arm... and then I'll give you a shot for the pain!
Move, move!
Off the beach!
Take cover!
You got a girl back home, Marine?
We're gonna make sure she sees you, all right?
I need pressure on this wound!
Where's the fire coming from?
Where are they?
Look for a flash, shoot at it!
Let's go, let...
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!
You're over!
Third Squad, forward!
Move!
Where are they, sir?
We got ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock, pillbox!
Sergeant!
Sergeant!
What?
I think I can clear that out.
All right, you go.
Here.
Take these.
Check your weapon.
Yeah?
Go!
Cover!
Cover him!
Cover, cover!
Son-of-a-bitch.
Let's go!
Go!
Move it out!
Go, go, go!
Down, down, down!
It's clear.
Good work.
I thought you said it was clear!
It was!
Shit, I guess they're not in there firing at us, then.
Lindberg!
Yeah!
Light it up!
I'll cover you, Ice!
Don't cover shit!
There's already enough people shooting!
One bullet and this thing goes up like a Roman candle!
Go!
Shift fire!
Shift your fire!
Go, go!
Shift your fire!
Shift your fire!
Go!
Move it out!
Hit the deck!
Stay down!
Wait for support!
Is this a bad battle or what?
It's a fucking slaughter.
Christ Jesus!
Get a machine gun team set up over here, now!
Thank God!
Tanks!
Runner!
Get those tanks up here!
Oh, shit.
Get down!
Corporal, watch your left flank!
Let's go without them!
Move out!
Move out!
Iggy, you gotta lift your side, he's gonna roll off.
Got it, Doc!
Incoming!
Move, move, move, move!
Keep moving!
Get that LVT up on the beach!
Keep moving!
You're next, pal, we're getting you out of here.
Move it!
Great news.
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa... 'cause that's where we're headed.
Not you and me.
Captain Severance asked me who else was in that picture... and Christ if I could remember... but it was Mike and Doc, and Franklin and me, and Hank Hansen... but I just remembered, you were there, too.
I wasn't there.
'Course you were.
Neither was Hank.
He raised the first flag.
It was Harlon Block that raised that one.
Shit.
I told them it was Hank.
You weren't there, Mr. Smart Ass, how'd you know it was Harlon?
You tell them it was me?
No.
Like I said, I just remembered.
Good, keep your mouth shut.
They know there was somebody else, you can see it in the picture.
Then pick someone dead.
They don't want somebody dead, you dumb redskin... they want to ship us back to the States.
What did I tell you?
I wasn't there.
You hear?
All right.
Just settle down.
I'm not going anywhere.
You're not going anywhere.
Who the hell says?
This is horseshit.
You wounded, son?
No, sir.
Did you take out a nest of Japs butt-naked, with your bare hands?
'Cause if I'm gonna give up my seat to a hero... he better have a good goddamn story to tell.
No, sir.
Then enjoy it, 'cause they'll forget you before Christmas.
The sixth man, you got a name?
Sorry, still don't remember.
It's a damn shame, 'cause I promised the Major... you'd know who it was.
Fact, you not knowing, throws a doubt on you... being one of the flag-raisers yourself.
Since no one wants to be embarrassed, the moment you land... they'll turn you around, ship you off to Okinawa... in time to meet your buddies on the beach.
So, why don't you stop screwing with me?
Give me a damn name.
Gangway!
Gangway!
Let's go, let's go!
Gangway!
Where the hell is that son of a bitch?
Hayes!
Hayes?
Hayes, get your red ass over here!
Make me look like I don't know what my own men are doing... with a flag the size of my mother's house?
God damn it, Ira, you shouldn't have lied to me.
You made me look like a complete asshole.
We're gonna miss you around here.
Good luck.
Now your name's in the paper, too.
Just heard your doctor say we're postponing your operation.
You're being shipped back to the mainland.
Everybody who saw that picture thought planting the flag... meant victory.
That's all they wanted to know.
Victory.
Within a few weeks of that picture being taken... half the men in it were dead.
Mrs. Hansen!
Mrs. Hansen!
Did you know Hank was a hero?
Are you proud of him, Mrs. Hansen?
What was he like as a boy?
Look this way, please, ma'am.
What do you have to say about your son?
But somehow being a part of it meant something.
Looking at it, you could believe their sacrifice was not a waste.
Yeah, I might have thought that was Harlon, too.
It is.
Belle, their names are right here.
It's not him.
And he would be alive and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.
You think about that when you look at his picture, Ed.
And I need to rush home and change... because there's the Governor's banquet... and then there's the parade.
Imagine, the Governor is coming here to meet us.
Now, I'm wearing blue so, if...
We interrupt this program...
Are you going to change?
to bring you a special news bulletin... from CBS World News.
A press association has just announced... that President Roosevelt is dead.
The President died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
All we know so far, is that the President died... at Warm Springs, in Georgia.
Further updates, every hour.
Temperatures will remain the same today... in the mid-30s to low 40s with clear skies.
Hello?
Yes.
Of course.
No, we understand.
It wouldn't be right.
Thank you.
Here he is, gentlemen.
Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.
Senator Haddigan.
I'd like you to meet...
Private First Class, Ira Hayes.
Damn good to meet you.
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.
Sorry?
That's Pima Indian talk, boy.
Don't you know your own language?
Took forever to memorize the damn gibberish.
Sorry, I've been away from the reservation too long, Senator.
Doc.
Ira.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
That's you.
Go, go, go, go.
Go.
Please welcome...
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley...
Private First Class Ira Hayes...
Private First Class Rene Gagnon!
Holy shit.
Come in, come in, come in.
Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.
Rene Gagnon.
Bud Gurber.
You showing the boys the sights?
We saw a hell of a ball game.
That's great.
The bar's there, help yourself.
I got some briefing sheets for you, here... just some simple things we want you to say.
Mostly, "Buy bonds".
Can't say that too often.
Itineraries, those are changing every couple minutes.
Everybody wants to meet you guys!
I got women sending up envelopes with stockings in them... notes written in lipstick.
We won't mention that to the press, am I right?
Have a drink, for Christ's sake.
My God, what you boys must have seen over there...
I've been watching the newsreels.
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.
So, we got a hell of a lot of money to raise... and not a lot of time.
White House tomorrow, then we trot you over... to shake hands with a couple of hundred Congressmen... who won't pull a penny out of their pockets.
Politicians and actors.
You put them in a restaurant together... they'd die of old age before picking up the check.
Then New York City, Times Square... dinners with various hoi polloi, then Chicago...
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?
That's what we're calling the mothers of the dead flag-raisers.
You present each mother with a flag... they say a few words, people will shit money.
It'll be so moving.
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.
Lovely woman.
She knows how close you and her son were.
He wrote home about you.
She is very, very much looking forward to meeting you.
Hank wasn't in the picture.
Sorry?
Hank didn't raise that flag.
He raised the other one, the real flag.
The what?
The real... the real flag?
There's a real flag?
Yeah, ours was the replacement flag.
We put it up, when they took the other one down.
Am I the only one getting a headache, here?
You know about this?
It was after it was already in the papers.
The mothers had already been told, but...
That's it, that's beautiful.
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Yeah, why tell me?
I'm only the guy that has to explain it... to 150 million Americans.
Who is in the goddamn picture?
Are any of you guys in the goddamn picture?
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.
Six guys raising a flag over Iwo Jima.
Victory is ours.
You're three of them, right?
This was the fifth day, sir.
The battle went on for 35 more.
Well, what'd you do, raise a goddamn flag... every time you stopped for lunch?
Can I hit this guy?
You know what, I don't give a shit, you're in the picture... you raised the flag, that's the story we're selling, boys.
Are you deaf?
Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?
Harlon Block.
That's whose mother should be here... if anyone's should be.
You know, I think this whole damn thing is a farce, you ask me.
You know what they're calling this bond drive?
The Mighty Seventh.
They might've called it the...
"We're Flat Fucking Broke And Can't Even Afford Bullets...
So, We're Begging For Your Pennies" bond drive... but it didn't have quite the ring.
They could've called it that, though... because the last four bond drives came up so short... we just printed money, instead.
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street, he'll tell you... our dollar is next to worthless.
We borrowed so much.
And nobody is lending any more.
Ships aren't being built.
Tanks aren't being built.
Machine guns, bazookas, hand grenades, zip.
You think this is a farce?
You want to go back to your buddies?
Well, stuff some rocks in your pockets... before you get on the plane... because that's all we got left to throw at the Japanese.
And don't be surprised... if your plane doesn't make it off the runway... because the fuel dumps are empty.
And our good friends, the Arabs, are only taking bullion.
If we don't raise $14 billion... and that's million with a "B..."
this war is over by the end of the month.
We make a deal with the Japanese, we give whatever they want... and we come home, because you've seen them fight... and they sure as shit ain't giving up.
$14 billion.
The last three drives didn't make that much, altogether.
People on the street corners... they looked at this picture, and they took hope.
Don't ask me why, I think it's a crappy picture myself.
You can't even see your faces.
But it said we can win this war, are winning this war... we just need you to dig a little deeper.
They want to give us that money.
No, they want to give it to you.
But you, you don't want to ask for it.
You don't want to give them hope.
You want to explain about this person and that flag.
Well, that's your choice.
Because if we admit we made a mistake... that's all anybody'll talk about... and that will be that.
Gentlemen.
Mr. President, here they are.
Well, hello.
Good to see you.
Mr. President.
Darn good to see you, boys.
Heard you had a hell of a fight on your hands, out there... hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation in Arizona... am I right?
Yes, Mr. President.
Being an Indian, you are a truer American, than any of us.
Bet your people are proud to see you wear that uniform.
Very proud, sir.
They should be.
Well, I want to thank you for coming all this way... to Washington, to help us out.
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific... now we need you to fight for a mountain of cash.
And I don't expect you'll let us down.
No, sir.
No sir.
Good.
Go get it.
That's the end of this ceremony.
Let's take a look at this famous photo, over here... to see if I can pick you out.
My gosh.
There you are.
Boys.
Boys, this one's on me.
To those who can't be with us.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon.
May we have your autograph?
I suppose.
And your name is?
I don't know about you, but I get the impression...
I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.
You're such a hero.
I feel honored to be in your presence.
That's just not true.
That's professional work.
Here, to professionals.
Here they are.
You're the guys in the photograph, right?
I heard you were on the train.
Let me shake your hands, John Tennack.
John Bradley.
These boys are with me, Harvard and Yale types, didn't fight a lick.
Pappies all rich sons-of-bitches.
Boys, shake hands with some real war heroes.
Excuse me for one moment.
You can buy them a drink while you're at it.
That's right.
Drinks for these men all the way around.
Hey, you're the other one, aren't you?
John Tennack, Tennack Homes.
Rene Gagnon.
Pleased to meet you.
Have a drink, come on.
And here's my card.
Listen to me, Rene... when you get finished being famous you come see me... because if you can sell bonds, you can sell homes.
Now, they're not gonna build homes, anymore... they're gonna deliver them.
You heard of pre-fab homes?
No, sir.
Well, you will.
And you hang on to that card and you come see me, you hear?
All right?
Certainly will.
All right.
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?
If Mike and the guys could see us.
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it, would they?
Harlon!
Franklin!
Can you imagine Franklin... on this train... eating at the dining car, with all the silver?
We shouldn't be here, Doc.
There's gonna be a Hallelujah Day.
When the boys have all come home to stay.
And a million bands begin to play.
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka.
And when we've lit the torch of liberty... in each blacked-out land across the sea...
Ira!
Hey, Ira!
We heard the picture was posed!
What?
We heard you posed the picture!
Hey, Doc!
We're bigger than life, Doc!
And we'll heave a mighty sigh...
When each gal can kiss the boy she kissed goodbye...
And they'll come marching down Fifth Avenue...
The United Nations in review...
When this lovely dream has all come true... we'll be dancing the Victory Polka.
Good job.
Thank you.
Thank you, girls!
And now... here are the men you've been waiting to meet... the men in white.
Right behind me here, the heroes of Iwo Jima...
Private First Class Rene Gagnon...
Private First Class Ira Hayes... and Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley!
Thank you.
It's good of you people to come out tonight... in support of the war effort.
We really need you to buy bonds, that's for sure.
'Cause we can't win the war without your help.
As far as us being the heroes of Iwo Jima... that's just not the case.
We really didn't do much at all.
Especially him.
Especially me.
I was just a runner.
That's it.
We put up a flag.
The pole we attached it to was heavy, so it took a number of us.
We had our picture taken doing it.
The real heroes are dead on that island.
And we'd appreciate it, if you bought bonds in honor of them.
Thank you.
Jump on any grenades, Ira?
Take out any machine gun nests I missed?
At least I fired my weapon.
All right, knock it off.
You hit anything or were you too drunk then, too?
What?
Guys!
Come on!
Stop it.
Knock it off.
The tall man with the high hat will be coming down your way...
Get your savings out when you hear him shout...
"Any bonds today?"
Any bonds today?
Bonds of freedom, that's what I'm selling...
Any bonds today?
Rene, right here.
Sit between these two boys.
Here comes the freedom man... asking you to buy a share of freedom today... for us and they need our help.
And, if you think about it, I think you'll realize that buying more bonds is not just the right thing to do... but the only thing to do.
Yes, this war has gone on too long.
We have given too many lives.
And its cost...
Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
Strawberry.
has been far too high.
But if we waver now... if we don't dig deep and give more than we think we can... then those sacrifices would be wasted...
Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
and those lives lost in vain.
Let's move!
Go, go!
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over.
Where the hell are our tanks?
Stuck in the sand.
Captain says you're to go without them.
Christ.
That's real good work you're doing there, Rene.
All right, prepare to move out.
Pass the word.
Second Platoon!
Move!
Move!
Move!
All right, Second Platoon, on your feet!
Let's move out!
Jackass.
Let's move out!
Go, go!
Move, move, move!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Second Platoon, move out!
Doc!
Doc, get out of there!
Corpsman!
Doc!
Doc, get the hell out of there!
May I have your attention, please.
Train number 48 with service from New York City, Boston...
Rochester, New York...
Toledo, Ohio, and South Bend, Indiana is now arriving on Track 7.
Train number 48 now arriving on Track number 7.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.
Come on, boys.
Let's go.
Watch your step, ma'am.
Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the heroes of Iwo Jima.
Navy Corpsman, John "Doc" Bradley.
Private First Class, Ira Hayes.
And Private First Class, Rene Gagnon.
Rene!
That's my boyfriend!
Who the hell is that?
I don't know.
Rene, is that your girl?
Hey, what do they call you?
How about a photo?
Hey, look at that!
What's your name, doll?
What's your name?
Hey, she's a beauty.
Let's go find a saloon.
Smile, boys.
Give them their money's worth.
Hey, Doc, how's the tour going for you?
Thank you.
Where exactly are you staying?
I'm not sure yet.
Just forget about that.
Senator, I'd like you to meet Corpsman John Bradley.
Doc, right?
Yes, sir.
Nice to meet you, Senator.
Good to meet you, young man.
Now, we appreciate everything you've done... and everything you're doing.
Thank you, sir.
Quite all right.
This is Captain White.
Colonel Johns.
We're proud of you, Corpsman.
And then Colonel McCourtney.
Major General Green.
Nice to meet you.
Senator, this is Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Of course!
Now I hear you used a tomahawk on those Japs.
Is that true, Chief?
No, sir.
Well, tell them you did, makes a better story, huh?
Attaboy.
This is Captain Green.
John?
Madeline Evelley.
I recognize you from all the photographs.
I'm Hank's mom.
It's so nice to meet you, ma'am.
Hank was always talking about you.
This is PFC Rene Gagnon.
Pleasure to meet you, son.
Thanks for everything.
My pleasure.
Not at all.
Ira, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Strank, Mike's mom.
It's all right.
When I got the telegram, I...
I don't know what I'm trying to say, here.
Knowing he was with you that day and seeing him in that photograph,
I don't know why it makes me feel better, but it does.
It's so silly, isn't it?
No, it's not.
How are you, son?
Thank you very much.
We're the largest furniture wholesaler in Illinois.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I'll make sure he calls.
Well, thank you.
Thank you.
Are you Rene?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Franklin's mother.
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.
I'm Pauline, Rene's girlfriend.
Would you mind?
Paper said that's Hank... and I honestly can't tell.
It's horrible of a mother not to know her own son, isn't it?
But that's him, isn't it?
Well, to be honest, ma'am, it happened so quick... and with everything that was going on... it's kind of hard to remember who was where.
But...
Yeah, I think...
I think that's where he was.
That's Hank.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Excuse us.
Take him outside.
I'm Pauline.
Very nice to meet you.
Hi, nice to meet you.
He was the best Marine I ever knew.
Thank you.
You okay, Chief?
Oh, Christ!
I'm okay.
Yeah, you look it.
You're gonna screw this up, aren't you?
You're gonna screw it up for all of us.
I've got him.
Get some sleep, Ira.
Mike?
Yeah?
You see this?
What?
Mike!
Oh, shit, go!
He's killing me!
Hey, Doc, you think they got them all?
What?
Well, they're not shooting at us.
Maybe we killed them all.
Or, they ran off in the night or something.
Or they're waiting for us to start climbing.
Third Platoon!
Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.
Just us?
Yeah, just us, Igg.
All right, Third Platoon, move!
Can I tag along?
Yeah, you can lead the way, if you want.
Get a good shot of my face.
It's your ass I'm gonna make famous, Hank.
Hey, that'll work for me, too.
Lieutenant... if you make it to the top, put this up.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, Iggy.
They never shoot at the first patrol.
They don't?
No.
They want us to go up to the top, signal to the others... that it's okay... then shoot everybody else as they come up the mountain.
Really?
Yeah.
Unless of course they want to make an example of us... and discourage all the others.
I think you're full of crap, you know that, Hank?
Really?
Jesus.
Thank God that ain't us.
Told you.
Boots, spread them out and put them on a line.
Set up a perimeter!
First Squad!
Hank?
Find me a pole.
Yeah.
Let's put this flag up.
Watch it.
Right over here.
Right here.
That's good.
That's good.
Right here, right here.
Got that end?
Hold that steady.
Lindberg.
Hey, who's got rope?
Right here.
Give me something.
Yeah, good.
That work?
Do it, fellas.
Keep it coming.
USMC!
USMC!
Shit, look at that!
Jeez, look at that.
Get down!
Take cover!
Cover with that .30!
Watch it!
Twenty yards down, Hank!
You see them?
I got about twenty yards, left side.
Lindberg, get the flamethrower!
Boots, you see them?
Cover right!
About twenty yards down!
Duck one!
You see them?
Keep the cover on!
Second Squad, you see them?
Get me some grenades!
I see them!
You see them?
Right flank, over to the right!
Cover me, I'm going down!
Careful, Iggy.
Easy.
All clear!
Okay, guys, who wants to be famous?
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
God damn it.
Strank!
Sir?
They want a phone line run up to the top of the mountain.
Let me guess, they picked us.
Second Platoon, let's go.
Get some exercise.
Let's go!
Get off your ass.
Oh, shit!
Hope it still works, 'cause you're not getting mine!
Get Forrestal!
All right, then.
I don't know whose idea it was, Mr. Secretary.
Well, it was goddamn brilliant.
I want that flag, Holland.
Mark my words, raising that son-of-a-bitch... means a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.
I want that flag.
Yes, sir.
I'll make sure no one touches it.
You can count on me.
Fuck that.
That flag belongs to the men in this battalion.
That son-of-a-bitch thinks that our men died taking this ground... so we could hand over our flag to some politician... to pin to his wall?
He's out of his goddamn mind!
Get me that flag, and find another one to replace it.
You've gotta be shitting me.
Gagnon!
Get your ass over here.
Hey.
Hi, fellas.
How's it going?
Missed a beautiful shot, Joe.
It's that kind of day.
Hey, Mike.
Hell of a view, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant!
Captain says he wants that flag.
He wants this flag?
Yes, sir.
We just put the damn thing up.
Yes, sir.
Some kind of flag shortage?
He wants you to put this one up, instead.
Hey, Mike.
Do me a favor and put this up, will you?
Yes, sir.
All right, let's find a pole.
Take the flag down, boys.
Captain's orders.
You heard him, let's do it.
There you go.
Lordy, she's a heavy one.
All right, hang on.
Put this on.
One hell of a view, huh?
Good view from up here.
Yes, I'd say so myself.
All right.
Not in your way here, am I, Joe?
Nah, I'm fine, thanks.
Hey, Doc, you wanna give us a hand, here?
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.
Ready?
Ready?
Let's go.
You get it?
I don't know.
I wish I could've seen their faces.
Nobody even noticed that second flag going up.
Everybody saw that damn picture... and made up their own story about it.
But your dad and the others knew what they had done... and what they had not done.
All your friends dying... it's hard not to be called a hero for saving somebody's life.
But for putting up a pole?
You gotta be kidding.
Hey!
It took a lot of talented folks a long time... to make that thing.
Now, just wait till tonight when it's lit properly... and there's thousands of cheering people in the stands.
It's gonna look a lot better.
So, stadium lights come down... spotlight comes up and you get your cue.
You charge up this thing with the flag, you plant it at the top.
You smile, you wave.
You know the drill.
You want us to plant the flag on a pile of papier-mache.
Hey, that's show biz.
And try and stand how you stood the first time you planted it.
Just, you know, pretend the other three guys are with you.
The dead guys.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, not a problem.
Good.
But where do we imagine Hank is standing?
Sorry?
Well, seeing that he wasn't there... it'll be kind of hard for us to leave a space for him.
Oh, I think you know exactly where he was.
You pointed him out to his mother.
This is bullshit.
I planted that damn thing once, and I'm not doing it again.
Hayes!
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Hayes.
Hayes, get your ass back here, or you're going on report.
Hayes!
You wanna do your damn job?
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Come on!
He's with me!
Hey, he's with me!
Back off!
Sri?
Sir, he's with me.
Okay?
He's with me.
Ira, put the goddamn chair down!
Put the chair down, son!
Put the chair down, Ira!
Tell them drop their sticks!
Ira, they're cops, they're supposed to have nightsticks.
You're not supposed to be in the street swinging a chair.
Calm down, son!
Sir, turn around, please.
That poster right there?
The one on the end, that's him.
That's him?
Yes, sir.
You read the papers?
Christ.
We got another fucking hero.
Get him out of here.
Can you do that?
Yes, sir.
Put the goddamn chair down.
And let's go.
Did you start this?
He didn't serve me!
I don't make the rules.
We don't serve Indians.
He needs to go sleep it off.
Soldier Field.
You hear that?
What the hell is that?
I can't figure it out.
Keep an eye out.
It sounds like it's coming from up there.
They're using grenades.
They're killing themselves.
Ira, let's go.
Come on.
Let's go, Ira.
Come on.
Thank God.
Jesus.
Look at you, Chief.
You found him.
Holy shit.
You would have to pick today.
Vandegrift is here with enough brass to start a fucking band.
Come on, let's go.
Can you walk?
Yes, sir.
By yourself?
All right, look.
I don't care if you have to carry him... get him to the top, plant that flag, and don't fucking fall off.
Get him in his stuff.
I'll stall these guys for as long as I can.
Hurry up.
Jesus Christ.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Cover!
Harlon!
Harlon!
Get your fire team up in that position!
O'Hare!
First Fire Team!
Work around!
BAR, you, on the side of the ridge!
Covering fire boys, go, go, go!
Jackson, work your team around to the left!
Cover!
Left flank!
Left flank!
Franklin, Gust, go check it out!
Hustle up, boys!
We got them!
Clear!
One hell of an experience.
Move out!
Cease fire!
They're my men!
You're targeting our men!
You're targeting our...
Get me another radio!
Sergeant?
Sergeant!
Mike!
Mike, Mike, Mike.
Mike?
Mike.
Hey, where's Doc?
Corpsman!
Oh, shit.
How's his breathing?
Harlon, move, buddy.
Hey, Mike.
Mike, Mike, can you hear us?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on, Mike.
Mike?
Mike, can you hear us?
All right, let's go!
Move out!
I'm gonna get a stretcher.
Let's take him down, move him off the beach.
Ladies and gentlemen, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Corpsman!
Hank!
Hank!
Doc, they killed me.
Harlon!
Doc... they killed me.
Come on, Harlon.
Harlon, stay with me.
Franklin!
I'm fine, Ira.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Where'd he go?
Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Does it open?
Iggy!
Iggy!
Iggy, are you down there?
Iggy!
Can't tell who it is, but he's one of ours.
I had to go outside to throw up.
Look what they did to the poor son-of-a-bitch.
You okay, Chief?
Just let it go.
If that doesn't pry open their wallets, nothing will.
Jesus Christ, he's drunk.
Goddamn Indians.
Come on, Chief.
Let's get you home.
That's not what I hear.
I called around, I'm not stupid.
He's been drunk since he started this damn tour... making a spectacle of himself.
Just about choked that poor woman at the reception, blubbering.
Jesus Christ, you're supposed to be watching these men.
Yes, sir.
Well, he's making us look like regular asses.
Well, with all due respect, sir... he never wanted to come on this trip, in the first place.
We had to pull him kicking and screaming, off that boat.
He wants to be with his unit.
What unit?
They're all fucking dead.
This is how he honors those men?
By drinking and throwing up...
You know what?
He wants it, great, we'll send him back.
Get him packed and on a train, today.
He's an embarrassment to the uniform.
Yes, sir.
I'll do it.
Yeah, no, that's... that's good.
That's what I want.
I know it's a good thing... raising the money and that, 'cause we need it.
But...
I can't take them calling me a hero.
All I did was try not to get shot.
Some of the things I saw done... things I did... they weren't things to be proud of, you know?
Mike...
Mike was a hero.
You ever meet him?
No.
Best Marine I ever met.
You know, Chief, I think if Mike was sitting here instead of you... he'd be saying the same thing about himself... not being a hero.
Maybe.
He was a good guy.
But I think that he would be ashamed of me... seeing me the way I am.
Think I could see my ma before they ship me off?
Think they'd do that?
See my ma?
I'm sorry, Ira.
We got stories now to tell our kids, I guess.
Keep your head down.
All aboard.
Good luck, Chief.
I think I saw him once, after that.
It was maybe six, or seven years after the war.
I was working as a salesman, doing a lot of driving.
I was driving west across Texas.
I was just trying to get where I was going so I could get home.
And I saw this guy hitchhiking on the side of the road.
And, for a second, I thought it might've been him.
I always regret that I didn't stop, but I was in a hurry.
And he was an Indian.
We always told the press that Ira insisted... that he was going back to fight with his unit... which was at least partially true, but... that isn't what got the headlines.
We're engaged.
Excuse me a minute, darling.
Hey, Doc?
Yeah?
Got a minute?
Yeah.
I'll see you at the car.
You hear I'm getting married?
I did, Rene.
That's great.
Yeah, it's something she wants.
She waited for me all this time.
She's not used to all this, but she's a good girl.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
So, I was wondering if you'd be my best man.
Me?
Don't you have somebody at home, a buddy, you'd rather ask?
Well, I didn't really make many.
The ones who didn't go, it's... well, it's hard to even talk to them.
You know?
Yeah, I know.
I'd be proud to.
Thank you.
I better go drag her away from them, before she announces...
I'm gonna be president of General Motors, or something.
All right.
Congratulations.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Rene, you're a lucky man.
Big smile, Mrs. Gagnon!
Say cheese!
I couldn't complain because the press loved them... so, they wrote more articles and people bought more bonds.
The tour went on with just Rene and your dad.
And the true heroes are the men... who didn't make it home from Iwo Jima... the men who died at Iwo Jima and in other campaigns.
We ask that you honor the memory of those men... by buying the war bonds and helping us to win this war.
Thank you.
City after city, I thought the damn thing'd never end.
And this rumor kept going around that the photograph had been staged.
I remember your dad telling them... that he wished he'd known he was having his picture taken... because he would've ducked the hell out of it.
Whose idea was it?
Who wanted to stage the thing?
Come on, it was you?
Was there truth to the rumor that that picture was staged, Doc?
Come on!
Doc?
Can you answer that?
I remember when your dad got shot.
All hell was busting loose.
People back home saw that picture... and thought it was over when we took Suribachi.
We wished.
Anyways, we're pinned down.
Mortars, shells, machine guns.
Fire coming from every which direction, right?
And we hear somebody call, "Corpsman down."
Corpsman down!
Blood was spurting out of his throat... and Doc was doing everything he could.
And the Corpsman looks up at him... and he knows what this means, to be shot in the neck.
He knows he's dying, you can see that.
But still... in his eyes, he's pleading with Doc to save his life.
And Doc can't.
You okay, Doc?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Yeah, you look fine.
I'm okay.
Keep down, all right?
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.
Okay.
Corpsman.
Corpsman!
For God sake, Corpsman!
Corpsman?
Corpsman.
Incoming!
Let me see.
It's not that bad.
You're gonna be okay.
All right?
Just stay with me.
Look at me.
Took us a half-hour to find your dad.
He could've bled to death.
Coming down!
Thanks.
Vets'll tell you about being hit... but not wanting to leave their buddies.
Usually, they're lying.
You'll take any excuse to get out of there.
But it happens.
You get the feeling you're letting them down.
I could see that in your dad's face.
He wanted to go, he'd seen enough.
But he didn't want to leave us.
Now, he was a hell of a good man, your dad.
Yeah.
While we were sitting there on the beach... we heard this great roar!
And we looked up.
That was the first of thousands of landings on Iwo.
Look at that.
Yeah.
How about that.
I'm gonna head back, all right?
Good luck.
That island saved a lot of lives.
A lot of lives.
I don't know what else to tell you.
After the bond tour, my dad finally got his operation.
By the time he got home, the war was over.
First thing he did was ask my mom to marry him.
Ira tried to get on with his life and put it all behind him.
Thank you for having me here, today.
It's an honor to be in front of such a strong people.
Because of the war... white men will understand Indians a lot better.
And it's going to be a better world.
But life had other plans for him.
You're... you're him, aren't you?
You're the hero, right?
Great.
All right, kids, go get your picture taken.
Oh, that's great.
That's great.
All right, now say cheese.
Cheese!
That's great!
Okay.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Thanks.
Come on.
That's a hero, kids.
Hero, lift this basket, will you?
It's too heavy for me.
Rene tried to take advantage of those offers he'd received... on the bond tour.
Yes.
G-A-G-N-O-N.
Right.
Pronounced, Rene.
Rene, yes.
Okay, I actually called last week.
Yes.
Okay, yes.
Mr. Gagnon.
I gave Mr. Tennack your message.
I'm sure he'll call you.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
But he was yesterday's hero.
He even applied for a job at the local police station.
They said he wasn't qualified.
After working the factory with Pauline he tried a few things... but spent the rest of his life as a janitor.
But Ira...
Ira!
You got a visitor.
Ira always made the news.
I could never find out why he did it... but one day Ira just took off.
He walked and hitched over 1,300 miles... from Arizona to Texas.
He found Harlon Block's father working his field.
His wife, Belle, had left him... soon after they discovered Harlon died.
She never forgave him for letting her son go off to war.
And Ira told him the truth... that it had been his son who raised the flag with them... his son in the photograph.
And then he just turned and walked away.
Though the flag-raising meant nothing to him... he somehow knew it would mean everything to them.
Thanks for calling.
Just as Belle knew, all along.
The press soon found out... and called Hank's mom with the news... that it wasn't her son, after all.
The last time they all saw each other... was at the unveiling of the Marine Corps War Memorial.
And even though he planted the first flag above Iwo Jima...
Hank's mother and father weren't invited.
Ira.
It's good to see you, Ira.
Hell of a statue.
It wasn't long after that, that they found Ira.
The papers said he died of exposure.
There was no autopsy.
It was about that same time... when my father got in his car early one morning... telling my mom he had something to do.
He drove to a town on the other side of Wisconsin... where Iggy's mom lived.
Ever since she heard the news about her son... she'd been trying to find out how he died... and no one would tell her.
I never found out what he told her... but I can pretty much guarantee it wasn't the truth.
My mother would ask him what was troubling him.
He would never say.
And every year, as it got close to Memorial Day... the reporters would start calling asking to interview my father.
No, I'm sorry.
He's fishing in Canada.
We were always instructed to say the same thing.
Okay.
Thanks.
When Mr. McCandless retired... my father bought the funeral home where he'd worked... since coming home.
He spent the rest of his life running the business... and raising his family.
He never spoke about the war, or about the flag-raising... never told us anything.
The first time I heard any of these stories was after he died.
Where is he?
Oh, God.
He's not here, Dad.
He died.
Who?
Who died?
Iggy.
Iggy.
Christ, poor Iggy.
I hadn't thought of him, for years.
How do you know about Iggy?
You were calling for him, when you collapsed.
I wasn't looking for Iggy.
I was looking for you.
I wanted to...
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry I wasn't a better father.
Talked to you more.
I just...
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
You were the best father a man could have.
Did I ever tell you they took us swimming?
No, Dad.
After we planted the flag, we came down off the mountain... and they let us swim.
It was the funniest thing.
All this fighting... and we were jumping around in the water, like kids.
That's the way I remember Iggy, now.
I finally came to the conclusion that maybe he was right.
Maybe there's no such thing as heroes.
Maybe there are just people like my dad.
I finally came to understand... why they were so uncomfortable being called heroes.
Heroes are something we create, something we need.
It's a way for us to understand what is almost incomprehensible... how people could sacrifice so much for us.
But for my dad and these men... the risks they took, the wounds they suffered... they did that for their buddies.
They may have fought for their country... but they died for their friends.
For the man in front, for the man beside them.
And if we wish to truly honor these men... we should remember them the way they really were... the way my dad remembered them.
Come on, Doc!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
For God sakes!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Honey, what's wrong?
Every jackass thinks he knows what war is.
Especially those who've never been in one.
We like things nice and simple, good and evil, heroes and villains.
There's always plenty of both.
Most of the time, they are not who we think they are.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where...
Where is he?
Where is he?
Mr. Bradley?
Mr. B?
You okay?
- Where is he?
- Where is who?
Where is he?
Where did he go?
Where...
Where is he?
All right.
Just stay right here, okay?
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
It'll be okay.
Where is he?
Most guys I knew would never talk about what happened over there.
Probably 'cause they're still trying to forget about it.
They certainly didn't think of themselves as heroes.
They died without glory.
Nobody has taken their pictures.
Only their buddies knew what they did.
I'd tell their folks they died for their country.
I'm not sure that was it.
Now, there were plenty other photos taken that day, but none anybody wanted to see.
What we see and do in war, the cruelty, is unbelievable.
But somehow we gotta make some sense of it.
To do that, we need a easy to understand truth and damn few words.
Film's ruined.
I don't know.
This one looks all right.
And if you can get a picture...
Now, the right picture can win or lose a war.
You're gonna want to see this.
Look at Vietnam.
The picture of that South Vietnamese officer blowing that fella's brains out of the side of his head, whammo!
That was it.
The war was lost.
We just hung around trying to pretend it wasn't.
Took a lot of other pictures that day.
None of them made a difference.
Thanks.
Appreciate it.
Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.
Country was bankrupt.
People were becoming cynical and tired of war.
Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon!
Where?
Right there.
Planting that flag, that's your brother.
Ma, all you can see is his behind.
And that's his.
I powdered and diapered it, I know my son.
That's him.
Go get your father.
Daddy, Ma's got a picture of Harlon's keister in the paper.
You watch your mouth, young man.
Thank you.
One photo, almost all on its own, turned that around.
It's on the front page of every major paper.
Over 200 dailies and they're all flooded with requests for prints.
I think we might have found it.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- I gotta go get him.
- Oh, no, you don't.
Iggy, I gotta go.
I have a whole different theory.
He wants medical attention bad enough, he'll come to us.
Shut up and crawl over here, you lazy son-of-a-bitch!
As soon as that flare goes out.
- Crap.
Okay, well, I'll go with you.
- No.
You're actually gonna leave me here?
I'll be right back, just shoot some people.
I gotta go.
Oh, God.
Okay, it's okay.
Don't touch them.
Don't touch them.
Get your hands out of there.
Let me do that.
I'll do it, okay?
Don't look.
Keep your head back.
Keep your eyes on me.
All right, look at me.
I'll get it.
I'll take care of it.
We'll get this bandage on you.
We'll get you taken care of.
And we'll get you down to the bottom, all right?
Look, you're gonna be fine.
It's okay.
I'll do that.
I'll do that.
Here, put some pressure on that.
Put your hands on top and put some pressure on it.
Keep your head back.
Keep breathing.
Keep looking at me, all right?
Just keep looking at...
Doc.
Help me.
Help me.
All right.
Okay.
How's that feel?
- It feels good.
- It does?
All right.
- Good.
- All right.
I'm gonna go get a stretcher and get you down to the beach.
I'll be right back.
I'm all right.
Go and help someone who's hurt.
All right.
Hold on there.
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Lggy!
Lggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Lggy!
Holy shit.
They expect us to climb this?
Or something just like it.
So, where you think they're sending us?
I think it's the desert, Franklin.
Well, that makes no sense at all.
Well, it's just military psychology.
They always train you for the desert on a volcano.
Now you're just having fun with me.
Harlon, take your men right.
- Watch for Bedouins.
- Yes, sir.
- What's a Bedouin?
- It's a guy with a camel.
Well, Jeez Louise, maybe we are going to the desert.
Now, you tilt that to the right, but what if the bullet comes from the left?
Bullets don't come from the left.
You know any left-handed Japs?
That makes about as much sense as you showering with your shoes on.
You don't even know why you do it, do you?
'Cause I don't tell you mean I don't know?
You do it 'cause Mike does it.
I'll ask him.
So you cut hair back home?
Some.
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?
No, I just studied it a little.
But not in barber school?
Nope.
- Gosh.
- Let me guess, Hayes is winning.
Chief, I had very little to do with Sitting Bull's death, so maybe you could stop taking it out on me.
Different tribe.
The Pimas fought on the side of the white man.
- See, now that's smart.
- That is smart.
Yeah.
Worked real good for us.
Good luck, fellas.
Hey, good night, Lindberg.
Dead bodies.
He cuts hair on dead bodies.
What?
Even I knew that.
- Who's in?
- Oh, I'm in.
I'm in.
It must be a lot easier with them not moving around and all.
- There's that.
- Yeah.
You know what I been thinking?
Well, they been telling us we need to buddy up and I think we'd make pretty good buddies.
And how do you figure that?
Well, you know, in that we have a lot in common.
So, why do you cut dead people's hair, anyway?
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.
You tell a lot of people that?
You actually chose the Marines because they got the best uniform?
No sense being a hero if you don't look like one.
Jacks.
Queens.
Shit.
Do anything on that reservation but play cards, Chief?
All right, listen up, you sorry bunch of leathernecks!
We practice going over the side tomorrow which means we ain't long for this piece of rock.
All right!
One more thing, any man who doesn't have his masturbation papers in order better get them signed by tomorrow night or he ain't going overseas.
- I got mine already.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm square.
Wait.
Why am I just hearing about this?
That's horseshit, Franklin.
I don't have to repeat everything twice for you.
No, I didn't hear nothing about no masturbating papers.
Heard they were running short.
You know, nobody tells me nothing.
That's real nice, guys.
All right, get your ass over to the officer in charge of records.
Maybe he got some more left.
- Leave your smokes.
I'll play for you.
- Thanks, Mike.
Listen, he calls you an idiot, you take it like a man, okay?
Just do not leave without signing them.
- I appreciate it, Sergeant.
- You got it.
What the hell happened to your hair, Rene?
Look like a goddamn corpse.
Three points of contact on that rope at all times.
Next four.
Over the side.
Let's go.
Keep moving.
Next four, over the side.
Just keep your eye on the guy below you.
That's all you gotta look at.
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.
Keep three points of contact on the rope at all times.
You see?
No big thing.
Just one step at a time and keep your hands on the vertical rope.
Remember, once you're in the boat move away from the rope.
Just make sure you keep three points of contact on the rope.
I got him!
All right, get that man out of the water.
Give me a hand.
Grab his pack.
Don't worry about him, Doc.
All right, quit skylarking!
Keep it moving!
He'll be fine.
Our target, Island X, is an ugly, smelly, dirty little scab of rock called lwo Jima.
It means "Sulfur Island," which accounts for the smell.
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop, you ask me.
After 20 straight days of bombing you won't find a blade of grass or a twig on it.
It wasn't that pretty to start with.
Captain?
Lwo's just five-and-a-half miles long, two-and-a-half wide.
There's a lump down at the bottom.
That's Mount Suribachi.
On the maps in front of you the island is white.
Not much of it.
The black dots represent known enemy emplacements.
Coastal defense guns, dual-mount dual-purpose guns, covered artillery emplacements.
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes, and earth-covered structures.
I don't see any barracks or any other structures.
That's right.
And we still don't know why.
Now, this isn't just any island to them.
This isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, or Saipan.
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders in eight square miles.
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.
It's up to us to convince them.
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.
The 8th Ammo Company will land here to re-supply.
The Suribachi's guns are the biggest problem.
They can hit any point on the island.
We're sitting ducks until we take them out.
That's our job.
We cut across the island, right at the base, slit its throat, lop off its head.
And we take that mountain.
We take that mountain, we take their big guns.
We take their eyes.
Okay, I'm heading in.
Follow me.
Let's put a good show on for the Marines.
Close it up.
Take it right down to the deck.
Yeah, boys!
Man overboard portside!
See him?
Throw me a line!
He's right there.
- Where is he?
- Watch out, watch out, watch out.
Hawaii's that way!
Just keep paddling, Mac, we'll catch you on the way back!
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!
They're not gonna stop.
What?
None of them are.
They can't.
So much for "No man left behind."
- Sir.
- Come on in.
Look, I've had to make a few other changes.
I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
- You bet.
Trouble is, I already told my men I'd see them through this.
That your James Cagney impersonation?
'Cause I've heard better.
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.
Look, this isn't your first time through this.
- You don't need to prove anything.
- No, sir.
You're not the best sergeant I've ever had, you're just the best one that's still walking.
- Block's a good man.
- Yes, sir, he is.
The men know him, he can step right in.
You know, I have actually thought this through.
Platoon sergeant puts you further away from the bullets.
I already gave them my word, sir.
I told them I'd bring them all home to their mothers which means I already lied to half of them.
Can't lie to the rest.
- How are your men?
- They'll do fine.
Except maybe Gagnon.
Our own Tyrone Power?
Yes, sir.
He's a good man, just might be better use further back from the lines.
I'll use him as a runner.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
Now get out of here.
Hear the good news, Doc?
We're going in with the first waves.
Hey, you do that again I'll take your head off!
Fucking dominoes.
Iggy, have you ever heard news you considered to be bad?
The first ones off the ship, Doc.
Means we don't go over the side of the ship.
We hop on a tractor, they drive us right there.
Oh, shit, that is good news.
You see?
What'd I tell you?
What's going on?
Look at that.
We're killing them!
We're killing them, Doc.
I was promised 10 days of shelling.
You're giving me three and saying that's the best you can do?
I don't give a shit!
My men hit that beach with less than 10 and I'll be taking them home to their mamas in buckets!
Yeah, I know exactly why.
Because every Navy man with a scrambled egg on his chest wants to offload us here and sail to Japan so they can be there for the big finish, tell their kids they captured the Emperor all by themselves.
Well, you aren't going to Japan unless we take this piece of shit island!
These little pricks are dug in!
Okay, appreciate that, Jim.
Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
I'm okay.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
Jesus, Iggy, just leave me alone, all right?
How about you guys?
Knife?
Bayonet?
Kick in the ass?
How about you, Doc?
Sharpen your knife?
You sharpened it three times already.
Well, then I better make sure I didn't nick it.
Good man, Doc.
- Hey, Doc.
- Yeah.
When we land, try not to wave this kit around too much.
They got sharpshooters that are trained to look for them.
And they know that if they take out a corpsman another dozen Marines will die unattended.
All right?
Okay, Mike.
Yeah, right there.
Close the damn door.
For God's sake.
Yeah, like that's gonna help.
That your girlfriend, Chief?
Bet she's a pretty damn good-looking squaw.
Bet you're missing her, and that little wigwam of yours.
Welcome, all Marines off Iwo Jima.
We have a long-time wait...
It's what they do to prisoners,
- at least the lucky ones.
- Jesus.
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think about waving a white bandanna.
Poor Marines, so far from home for no good reason.
Think of your girls back home, waiting for you.
But a girl cannot stay home every night.
So who do you think they're with tonight?
And will she let him kiss her?
And will he comfort her at your funeral?
This sweet music is to make you think of your girls back home who are missing you.
This is all for now.
I'll see you tomorrow night.
Gunners!
Move, let's go!
Let's go, get up on the berm!
Gunners!
We're clear!
Get up the berm!
Baker Company, move out!
- Seen Second Platoon?
- I don't see them.
First Squad, move it out!
God, this place reeks.
- Go, go, go!
- Move out!
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go!
Go!
Go, go!
Drop your packs!
Go!
All clear!
- Jesus, you needed some exercise?
- He got lost.
A hundred landing craft heading for one beach and this guy gets lost.
Now I'm glad we did.
Jesus, what a mess.
Any theories why they ain't shooting?
It's getting on my nerves.
Maybe they're all dead.
What do you think, Doc?
You think they're all dead?
Mike, take six men and bring that gun onto the beach.
Second Platoon, let's move out!
Stay down.
Come on.
Move!
Move!
- Get down!
- Take cover!
Move out!
Cover fire!
Pour it on!
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!
Corpsman!
I'm gonna sling your arm and then I'll give you a shot for the pain!
Move, move!
Off the beach!
Take cover!
You got a girl back home, Marine?
We're gonna make sure she sees you, all right?
I need pressure on this wound!
Where's the fire coming from?
Where are they?
Look for a flash, shoot at it!
Let's go, let...
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!
You're over!
Third Squad, forward!
Move!
Where are they, sir?
We got ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock, pillbox!
Sergeant!
- Sergeant!
I think I can clear that out.
- What?
All right, you go.
Here.
Take these.
Check your weapon.
Yeah?
Go!
Cover!
Cover him!
Cover, cover!
Son-of-a-bitch.
Let's go!
Go!
Move it out!
Go, go, go!
Down, down, down!
It's clear.
Good work.
I thought you said it was clear!
It was!
Shit, I guess they're not in there firing at us then.
Lindberg!
Yeah!
Light it up!
I'll cover you, Ice!
Don't cover shit!
There's already enough people shooting!
One bullet and this thing goes up like a Roman candle!
Go!
Shift fire!
Shift your fire!
Go, go!
Shift your fire!
Shift your fire!
Go!
Move it out!
Hit the deck!
Stay down!
Wait for support!
Is this a bad battle or what?
It's a fucking slaughter.
Christ Jesus!
Get a machine gun team set up over here, now!
Thank God!
Tanks!
Runner!
Get those tanks up here!
Oh, shit.
Get down!
Corporal, watch your left flank!
Let's go without them!
Move out!
Move out!
Lggy, you gotta lift your side, he's gonna roll off.
Got it, Doc!
Incoming!
Move, move, move, move!
Keep moving!
Get that LVT up on the beach!
Keep moving!
You're next, pal, we're getting you out of here.
Move it!
Great news.
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa, 'cause that's where we're headed.
Not you and me.
Captain Severance asked me who else was in that picture, and Christ if I could remember, but it was Mike and Doc and Franklin and me and Hank Hansen but I just remembered, you were there, too.
I wasn't there.
'Course you were.
Neither was Hank.
He raised the first flag.
It was Harlon Block that raised that one.
Shit.
I told them it was Hank.
You weren't there, Mr. Smart Ass, how'd you know it was Harlon?
- You tell them it was me?
- No.
Like I said, I just remembered.
Good, keep your mouth shut.
They know there was somebody else, you can see it in the picture.
Then pick someone dead.
They don't want somebody dead, you dumb redskin, they want to ship us back to the States.
What did I tell you?
I wasn't there.
- You hear?
- All right.
Just settle down.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're not going anywhere.
Who the hell says?
This is horseshit.
You wounded, son?
No, sir.
Well, did you take out a nest of Japs butt-naked with your bare hands?
'Cause if I'm gonna give up my seat to a hero he better have a good goddamn story to tell.
No, sir.
Then enjoy it, 'cause they'll forget you before Christmas.
The sixth man, you got a name?
Sorry, still don't remember.
It's a damn shame, 'cause I promised the Major you'd know who it was.
Fact, you not knowing throws a doubt on you being one of the flag-raisers yourself.
Since no one wants to be embarrassed, the moment you land they'll turn you around, ship you off to Okinawa in time to meet your buddies on the beach.
So, why don't you stop screwing with me?
Give me a damn name.
Gangway!
Gangway!
Let's go, let's go!
Gangway!
Where the hell is that son-of-a-bitch?
Hayes!
Hayes?
Hayes, get your red ass over here!
Make me look like I don't know what my own men are doing with a flag the size of my mother's house?
God damn it, Ira, you shouldn't have lied to me.
You made me look like a complete asshole.
We're gonna miss you around here.
Good luck.
Now your name's in the paper, too.
Just heard your doctor say we're postponing your operation.
You're being shipped back to the mainland.
Everybody who saw that picture thought planting the flag meant victory.
That's all they wanted to know.
Victory.
Within a few weeks of that picture being taken, half the men in it were dead.
Mrs. Hansen!
Mrs. Hansen!
Did you know Hank was a hero?
- Are you proud of him, Mrs. Hansen?
- What was he like as a boy?
Look this way, please, ma'am.
What do you have to say about your son?
But somehow being a part of it meant something.
Looking at it, you could believe their sacrifice was not a waste.
Yeah, I might have thought that was Harlon, too.
It is.
Belle, their names are right here.
It's not him.
And he would be alive and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.
You think about that when you look at his picture, Ed.
And I need to rush home and change because there's the Governor's banquet and then there's the parade.
Imagine, the Governor is coming here to meet us.
Now, I'm wearing blue so, if...
- Are you going to change?
- We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin from CBS World News.
A press association has just announced that President Roosevelt is dead.
The President died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
All we know so far is that the President died at Warm Springs in Georgia.
Further updates every hour.
Temperatures will remain the same today, in the mid-30s to low 40s with clear skies.
Hello?
Yes.
Of course.
No, we understand.
It wouldn't be right.
Thank you.
Here he is, gentlemen.
Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.
Senator Haddigan.
I'd like you to meet Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Damn good to meet you.
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.
Sorry?
That's Pima Indian talk, boy, don't you know your own language?
Took forever to memorize the damn gibberish.
Sorry, I've been away from the reservation too long, Senator.
- Doc.
- Ira.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
- That's you.
- Go, go, go, go.
Go.
Please welcome
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley,
Private First Class Ira Hayes,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon!
Holy shit.
Come in, come in, come in.
Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Bud Gurber.
- You showing the boys the sights?
- We saw a hell of a ball game.
That's great.
The bar's there, help yourself.
I got some briefing sheets for you here, just some simple things we want you to say.
Mostly, "Buy bonds," can't say that too often.
Itineraries, those are changing every couple minutes.
Everybody wants to meet you guys.
I got women sending up envelopes with stockings in them, notes written in lipstick.
We won't mention that to the press, am I right?
Have a drink, for Christ's sake.
My God, what you boys must have seen over there.
I've been watching the newsreels.
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.
So, we got a hell of a lot of money to raise, not a lot of time.
White House tomorrow, then we trot you over to shake hands with a couple of hundred Congressmen who won't pull a penny out of their pockets.
Politicians and actors.
You put them in a restaurant together, they'd die of old age before picking up the check.
Then New York City, Times Square, dinners with various hoi polloi, then Chicago...
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?
That's what we're calling the mothers of the dead flag-raisers.
You present each mother with a flag, they say a few words, people will shit money.
It'll be so moving.
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.
Lovely woman.
She knows how close you and her son were.
He wrote home about you.
She is very, very much looking forward to meeting you.
Hank wasn't in the picture.
Sorry?
Hank didn't raise that flag.
He raised the other one, the real flag.
The what?
The real...
The real flag?
There's a real flag?
Yeah, ours was the replacement flag.
We put it up when they took the other one down.
Am I the only one getting a headache here?
You know about this?
It was after it was already in the papers.
The mothers had already been told, but...
That's it, that's beautiful.
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Yeah, why tell me?
I'm only the guy that has to explain it to 150 million Americans.
Who is in the goddamn picture?
Are any of you guys in the goddamn picture?
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.
Six guys raising a flag over lwo Jima.
Victory is ours.
You're three of them, right?
This was the fifth day, sir.
The battle went on for 35 more.
Well, what'd you do, raise a goddamn flag every time you stopped for lunch?
Can I hit this guy?
You know what, I don't give a shit, you're in the picture, you raised the flag, that's the story we're selling, boys.
Are you deaf?
Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?
Harlon Block.
That's whose mother should be here if anyone's should be.
You know, I think this whole damn thing is a farce, you ask me.
You know what they're calling this bond drive?
The Mighty Seventh.
They might've called it the
"We're Flat Fucking Broke And Can't Even Afford Bullets
"So We're Begging For Your Pennies" bond drive, but it didn't have quite the ring.
They could've called it that, though, because the last four bond drives came up so short we just printed money instead.
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street, he'll tell you our dollar is next to worthless, we borrowed so much.
And nobody is lending any more.
Ships aren't being built.
Tanks aren't being built.
Machine guns, bazookas, hand grenades, zip.
You think this is a farce?
You want to go back to your buddies?
Well, stuff some rocks in your pockets before you get on the plane because that's all we got left to throw at the Japanese.
And don't be surprised if your plane doesn't make it off the runway because the fuel dumps are empty.
And our good friends, the Arabs, are only taking bullion.
If we don't raise $14 billion, and that's million with a "B," this war is over by the end of the month.
We make a deal with the Japanese, we give whatever they want and we come home, because you've seen them fight, and they sure as shit ain't giving up.
$14 billion.
The last three drives didn't make that much all together.
People on the street corners, they looked at this picture and they took hope.
Don't ask me why, I think it's a crappy picture myself.
You can't even see your faces.
But it said we can win this war, are winning this war, we just need you to dig a little deeper.
They want to give us that money.
No, they want to give it to you.
But you, you don't want to ask for it.
You don't want to give them hope.
You want to explain about this person and that flag.
Well, that's your choice.
Because if we admit we made a mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about and that will be that.
Gentlemen.
Mr. President, here they are.
- Well, hello.
Good to see you.
- Mr. President.
Darn good to see you, boys.
Heard you had a hell of a fight on your hands out there, hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation in Arizona, am I right?
Yes, Mr. President.
Being an Indian, you are a truer American than any of us.
Bet your people are proud to see you wear that uniform.
Very proud, sir.
They should be.
Well, I want to thank you for coming all this way to Washington to help us out.
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific now we need you to fight for a mountain of cash.
- And I don't expect you'll let us down.
- No, sir.
Good.
Go get it.
That's the end of this ceremony.
Let's take a look at this famous photo over here, see if I can pick you out.
My gosh.
There you are.
Boys.
Boys, this one's on me.
To those who can't be with us.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon.
May we have your autograph?
I suppose.
And your name is?
I don't know about you, but I get the impression
I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.
You're such a hero.
I feel honored to be in your presence.
That's just not true.
That's professional work.
Here, to professionals.
Here they are.
You're the guys in the photograph, right?
I heard you were on the train.
Let me shake your hands, John Tennack.
John Bradley.
These boys are with me, Harvard and Yale types, didn't fight a lick.
Pappies all rich sons-of-bitches.
Boys, shake hands with some real war heroes.
Excuse me for one moment.
You can buy them a drink while you're at it.
That's right.
Drinks for these men all the way around.
And you're the other one, aren't you?
John Tennack, Tennack Homes.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Pleased to meet you.
Have a drink, come on.
And here's my card.
Listen to me, Rene, when you get finished being famous you come see me because if you can sell bonds, you can sell homes.
Now, they're not gonna build homes anymore, they're gonna deliver them.
- You heard of prefab homes?
- No, sir.
Well, you will.
And you hang on to that card and you come see me, you hear?
- All right?
- Certainly will.
All right.
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?
If Mike and the guys could see us.
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it, would they?
Harlon!
Franklin!
Can you imagine Franklin on this train
eating at the dining car with all the silver?
We shouldn't be here, Doc.
There's gonna be a Hallelujah Day
When the boys have all come home to stay
And a million bands begin to play
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
And when we've lit the torch of liberty
In each blacked-out land across the sea
Ira!
Hey, Ira!
We heard the picture was posed!
What?
We heard you posed the picture!
Hey, Doc!
We're bigger than life, Doc!
And we'll heave a mighty sigh
When each gal can kiss the boy she kissed goodbye
And they'll come marching down Fifth Avenue
The United Nations in review
When this lovely dream has all come true
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
Good job.
Thank you.
Thank you, girls!
And now, here are the men you've been waiting to meet, the men in white.
Right behind me here, the heroes of Iwo Jima,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon,
Private First Class Ira Hayes, and Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley!
Thank you.
It's good of you people to come out tonight in support of the war effort.
We really need you to buy bonds, that's for sure.
'Cause we can't win the war without your help.
As far as us being the heroes of Iwo Jima, that's just not the case.
We really didn't do much at all.
Especially him.
Especially me.
I was just a runner.
That's it.
We put up a flag.
The pole we attached it to was heavy, so it took a number of us.
We had our picture taken doing it.
The real heroes are dead on that island.
And we'd appreciate it if you bought bonds in honor of them.
Thank you.
Jump on any grenades, Ira?
Take out any machine gun nests I missed?
At least I fired my weapon.
All right, knock it off.
You hit anything or were you too drunk then, too?
What?
Guys!
Come on!
Stop it.
Knock it off.
The tall man with the high hat will be coming down your way
Get your savings out when you hear him shout
"Any bonds today?"
Any bonds today?
Bonds of freedom that's what I'm selling
Any bonds today?
Rene, right here.
Sit between these two boys.
Here comes the freedom man
Asking you to buy a share of freedom today ...for us and they need our help.
And, if you think about it, I think you'll realize that buying more bonds is not just the right thing to do but the only thing to do.
Yes, this war has gone on too long.
We have given too many lives.
And its cost...
- Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
- Strawberry.
...has been far too high.
But if we waver now, if we don't dig deep and give more than we think we can then those sacrifices would be wasted...
Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
...and those lives lost in vain.
Let's move!
Go, go!
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over.
Where the hell are our tanks?
Stuck in the sand.
Captain says you're to go without them.
Christ.
That's real good work you're doing there, Rene.
All right, prepare to move out.
Pass the word.
Second Platoon!
Move!
Move!
Move!
All right, Second Platoon, on your feet!
Let's move out!
Jackass.
Let's move out!
Go, go!
Move, move, move!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Second Platoon, move out!
Doc!
Doc, get out of there!
Corpsman!
Doc!
Doc, get the hell out of there!
May I have your attention, please.
Train number 48 with service from New York City, Boston,
Rochester, New York,
Toledo, Ohio, and South Bend, Indiana is now arriving on Track 7.
Train number 48 now arriving on Track number 7.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.
- Come on, boys.
- Let's go.
- Watch your step, ma'am.
- Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the heroes of Iwo Jima.
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.
Private First Class Ira Hayes.
And Private First Class Rene Gagnon.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
For God sakes!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Honey, what's wrong?
Every jackass thinks he knows what war is.
Especially those who've never been in one.
We like things nice and simple, good and evil, heroes and villains.
There's always plenty of both.
Most of the time, they are not who we think they are.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where...
Where is he?
Where is he?
Mr. Bradley?
Mr. B?
You okay?
-Where is he?
-Where is who?
Where is he?
Where did he go?
Where...
Where is he?
All right.
Just stay right here, okay?
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
It'll be okay.
Where is he?
Most guys I knew would never talk about what happened over there.
Probably 'cause they're still trying to forget about it.
They certainly didn't think of themselves as heroes.
They died without glory.
Nobody has taken their pictures.
Only their buddies knew what they did.
I'd tell their folks they died for their country.
I'm not sure that was it.
Now, there were plenty other photos taken that day, but none anybody wanted to see.
What we see and do in war, the cruelty, is unbelievable.
But somehow we gotta make some sense of it.
To do that, we need a easy to understand truth and damn few words.
Film's ruined.
I don't know.
This one looks all right.
And if you can get a picture...
Now, the right picture can win or lose a war.
You're gonna want to see this.
Look at Vietnam.
The picture of that South Vietnamese officer blowing that fella's brains out of the side of his head, whammo!
That was it.
The war was lost.
We just hung around trying to pretend it wasn't.
Took a lot of other pictures that day.
None of them made a difference.
Thanks.
Appreciate it.
Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.
Country was bankrupt.
People were becoming cynical and tired of war.
Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon!
Where?
Right there.
Planting that flag, that's your brother.
Ma, all you can see is his behind.
And that's his.
I powdered and diapered it, I know my son.
That's him.
Go get your father.
Daddy, Ma's got a picture of Harlon's keister in the paper.
You watch your mouth, young man.
Thank you.
One photo, almost all on its own, turned that around.
It's on the front page of every major paper.
Over 200 dailies and they're all flooded with requests for prints.
I think we might have found it.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
-I gotta go get him.
-Oh, no, you don't.
Iggy, I gotta go.
I have a whole different theory.
He wants medical attention bad enough, he'll come to us.
Shut up and crawl over here, you lazy son-of-a-bitch!
As soon as that flare goes out.
-Crap.
Okay, well, I'll go with you.
-No.
You're actually gonna leave me here?
I'll be right back, just shoot some people.
I gotta go.
Oh, God.
Okay, it's okay.
Don't touch them.
Don't touch them.
Get your hands out of there.
Let me do that.
I'll do it, okay?
Don't look.
Keep your head back.
Keep your eyes on me.
All right, look at me.
I'll get it.
I'll take care of it.
We'll get this bandage on you.
We'll get you taken care of.
And we'll get you down to the bottom, all right?
Look, you're gonna be fine.
It's okay.
I'll do that.
I'll do that.
Here, put some pressure on that.
Put your hands on top and put some pressure on it.
Keep your head back.
Keep breathing.
Keep looking at me, all right?
Just keep looking at...
Doc.
Help me.
Help me.
All right.
Okay.
How's that feel?
-It feels good.
-It does?
All right.
-Good.
-All right.
I'm gonna go get a stretcher and get you down to the beach.
I'll be right back.
I'm all right.
Go and help someone who's hurt.
All right.
Hold on there.
-Where'd he go?
-Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
-I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
-I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Holy shit.
They expect us to climb this?
Or something just like it.
So, where you think they're sending us?
I think it's the desert, Franklin.
Well, that makes no sense at all.
Well, it's just military psychology.
They always train you for the desert on a volcano.
Now you're just having fun with me.
Harlon, take your men right.
-Watch for Bedouins.
-Yes, sir.
-What's a Bedouin?
-It's a guy with a camel.
Well, Jeez Louise, maybe we are going to the desert.
Now, you tilt that to the right, but what if the bullet comes from the left?
Bullets don't come from the left.
You know any left-handed Japs?
That makes about as much sense as you showering with your shoes on.
You don't even know why you do it, do you?
'Cause I don't tell you mean I don't know?
You do it 'cause Mike does it.
I'll ask him.
So you cut hair back home?
Some.
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?
No, I just studied it a little.
But not in barber school?
Nope.
-Gosh.
-Let me guess, Hayes is winning.
Chief, I had very little to do with Sitting Bull's death, so maybe you could stop taking it out on me.
Different tribe.
The Pimas fought on the side of the white man.
-See, now that's smart.
-That is smart.
Yeah.
Worked real good for us.
Good luck, fellas.
Hey, good night, Lindberg.
Dead bodies.
He cuts hair on dead bodies.
What?
Even I knew that.
-Who's in?
-Oh, I'm in.
I'm in.
It must be a lot easier with them not moving around and all.
-There's that.
-Yeah.
You know what I been thinking?
Well, they been telling us we need to buddy up and I think we'd make pretty good buddies.
And how do you figure that?
Well, you know, in that we have a lot in common.
So, why do you cut dead people's hair, anyway?
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.
You tell a lot of people that?
You actually chose the Marines because they got the best uniform?
No sense being a hero if you don't look like one.
Jacks.
Queens.
Shit.
Do anything on that reservation but play cards, Chief?
All right, listen up, you sorry bunch of leathernecks!
We practice going over the side tomorrow which means we ain't long for this piece of rock.
All right!
One more thing, any man who doesn't have his masturbation papers in order better get them signed by tomorrow night or he ain't going overseas.
-I got mine already.
-Oh, yeah.
I'm square.
Wait.
Why am I just hearing about this?
That's horseshit, Franklin.
I don't have to repeat everything twice for you.
No, I didn't hear nothing about no masturbating papers.
Heard they were running short.
You know, nobody tells me nothing.
That's real nice, guys.
All right, get your ass over to the officer in charge of records.
Maybe he got some more left.
-Leave your smokes.
I'll play for you.
-Thanks, Mike.
Listen, he calls you an idiot, you take it like a man, okay?
Just do not leave without signing them.
-I appreciate it, Sergeant.
-You got it.
What the hell happened to your hair, Rene?
Look like a goddamn corpse.
Three points of contact on that rope at all times.
Next four.
Over the side.
Let's go.
Keep moving.
Next four, over the side.
Just keep your eye on the guy below you.
That's all you gotta look at.
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.
Keep three points of contact on the rope at all times.
You see?
No big thing.
Just one step at a time and keep your hands on the vertical rope.
Remember, once you're in the boat move away from the rope.
Just make sure you keep three points of contact on the rope.
I got him!
All right, get that man out of the water.
Give me a hand.
Grab his pack.
Don't worry about him, Doc.
All right, quit skylarking!
Keep it moving!
He'll be fine.
Our target, Island X, is an ugly, smelly, dirty little scab of rock called lwo Jima.
It means "Sulfur Island," which accounts for the smell.
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop, you ask me.
After 20 straight days of bombing you won't find a blade of grass or a twig on it.
It wasn't that pretty to start with.
Captain?
lwo's just five-and-a-half miles long, two-and-a-half wide.
There's a lump down at the bottom.
That's Mount Suribachi.
On the maps in front of you the island is white.
Not much of it.
The black dots represent known enemy emplacements.
Coastal defense guns, dual-mount dual-purpose guns, covered artillery emplacements.
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes, and earth-covered structures.
I don't see any barracks or any other structures.
That's right.
And we still don't know why.
Now, this isn't just any island to them.
This isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, or Saipan.
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders in eight square miles.
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.
It's up to us to convince them.
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.
The 8th Ammo Company will land here to re-supply.
The Suribachi's guns are the biggest problem.
They can hit any point on the island.
We're sitting ducks until we take them out.
That's our job.
We cut across the island, right at the base, slit its throat, lop off its head.
And we take that mountain.
We take that mountain, we take their big guns.
We take their eyes.
Okay, I'm heading in.
Follow me.
Let's put a good show on for the Marines.
Close it up.
Take it right down to the deck.
Yeah, boys!
Man overboard portside!
See him?
Throw me a line!
He's right there.
-Where is he?
-Watch out, watch out, watch out.
Hawaii's that way!
Just keep paddling, Mac, we'll catch you on the way back!
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!
They're not gonna stop.
What?
None of them are.
They can't.
So much for "No man left behind."
-Sir.
-Come on in.
Look, I've had to make a few other changes.
I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.
-Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
-You bet.
Trouble is, I already told my men I'd see them through this.
That your James Cagney impersonation?
'Cause I've heard better.
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.
Look, this isn't your first time through this.
-You don't need to prove anything.
-No, sir.
You're not the best sergeant I've ever had, you're just the best one that's still walking.
-Block's a good man.
-Yes, sir, he is.
The men know him, he can step right in.
You know, I have actually thought this through.
Platoon sergeant puts you further away from the bullets.
I already gave them my word, sir.
I told them I'd bring them all home to their mothers which means I already lied to half of them.
Can't lie to the rest.
-How are your men?
-They'll do fine.
Except maybe Gagnon.
Our own Tyrone Power?
Yes, sir.
He's a good man, just might be better use further back from the lines.
I'll use him as a runner.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
Now get out of here.
Hear the good news, Doc?
We're going in with the first waves.
Hey, you do that again I'll take your head off!
Fucking dominoes.
Iggy, have you ever heard news you considered to be bad?
The first ones off the ship, Doc.
Means we don't go over the side of the ship.
We hop on a tractor, they drive us right there.
Oh, shit, that is good news.
You see?
What'd I tell you?
What's going on?
Look at that.
We're killing them!
We're killing them, Doc.
I was promised 10 days of shelling.
You're giving me three and saying that's the best you can do?
I don't give a shit!
My men hit that beach with less than 10 and I'll be taking them home to their mamas in buckets!
Yeah, I know exactly why.
Because every Navy man with a scrambled egg on his chest wants to offload us here and sail to Japan so they can be there for the big finish, tell their kids they captured the Emperor all by themselves.
Well, you aren't going to Japan unless we take this piece of shit island!
These little pricks are dug in!
Okay, appreciate that, Jim.
Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
I'm okay.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
Jesus, Iggy, just leave me alone, all right?
How about you guys?
Knife?
Bayonet?
Kick in the ass?
How about you, Doc?
Sharpen your knife?
You sharpened it three times already.
Well, then I better make sure I didn't nick it.
Good man, Doc.
-Hey, Doc.
-Yeah.
When we land, try not to wave this kit around too much.
They got sharpshooters that are trained to look for them.
And they know that if they take out a corpsman another dozen Marines will die unattended.
All right?
Okay, Mike.
Yeah, right there.
Close the damn door.
For God's sake.
Yeah, like that's gonna help.
That your girlfriend, Chief?
Bet she's a pretty damn good-looking squaw.
Bet you're missing her, and that little wigwam of yours.
Welcome, all Marines off Iwo Jima.
We have a long-time wait...
It's what they do to prisoners,
-at least the lucky ones.
-Jesus.
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think about waving a white bandanna.
Poor Marines, so far from home for no good reason.
Think of your girls back home, waiting for you.
But a girl cannot stay home every night.
So who do you think they're with tonight?
And will she let him kiss her?
And will he comfort her at your funeral?
This sweet music is to make you think of your girls back home who are missing you.
This is all for now.
I'll see you tomorrow night.
Gunners!
Move, let's go!
Let's go, get up on the berm!
Gunners!
We're clear!
Get up the berm!
Baker Company, move out!
-Seen Second Platoon?
-I don't see them.
First Squad, move it out!
God, this place reeks.
-Go, go, go!
-Move out!
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go!
Go!
Go, go!
Drop your packs!
Go!
All clear!
-Jesus, you needed some exercise?
-He got lost.
A hundred landing craft heading for one beach and this guy gets lost.
Now I'm glad we did.
Jesus, what a mess.
Any theories why they ain't shooting?
It's getting on my nerves.
Maybe they're all dead.
What do you think, Doc?
You think they're all dead?
Mike, take six men and bring that gun onto the beach.
Second Platoon, let's move out!
Stay down.
Come on.
Move!
Move!
-Get down!
-Take cover!
Move out!
Cover fire!
Pour it on!
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!
Corpsman!
I'm gonna sling your arm and then I'll give you a shot for the pain!
Move, move!
Off the beach!
Take cover!
You got a girl back home, Marine?
We're gonna make sure she sees you, all right?
I need pressure on this wound!
Where's the fire coming from?
Where are they?
Look for a flash, shoot at it!
Let's go, let...
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!
You're over!
Third Squad, forward!
Move!
Where are they, sir?
We got ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock, pillbox!
Sergeant!
-Sergeant!
I think I can clear that out.
-What?
All right, you go.
Here.
Take these.
Check your weapon.
Yeah?
Go!
Cover!
Cover him!
Cover, cover!
Son-of-a-bitch.
Let's go!
Go!
Move it out!
Go, go, go!
Down, down, down!
It's clear.
Good work.
I thought you said it was clear!
It was!
Shit, I guess they're not in there firing at us then.
Lindberg!
Yeah!
Light it up!
I'll cover you, Ice!
Don't cover shit!
There's already enough people shooting!
One bullet and this thing goes up like a Roman candle!
Go!
Shift fire!
Shift your fire!
Go, go!
Shift your fire!
Shift your fire!
Go!
Move it out!
Hit the deck!
Stay down!
Wait for support!
Is this a bad battle or what?
It's a fucking slaughter.
Christ Jesus!
Get a machine gun team set up over here, now!
Thank God!
Tanks!
Runner!
Get those tanks up here!
Oh, shit.
Get down!
Corporal, watch your left flank!
Let's go without them!
Move out!
Move out!
Iggy, you gotta lift your side, he's gonna roll off.
Got it, Doc!
Incoming!
Move, move, move, move!
Keep moving!
Get that LVT up on the beach!
Keep moving!
You're next, pal, we're getting you out of here.
Move it!
Great news.
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa, 'cause that's where we're headed.
Not you and me.
Captain Severance asked me who else was in that picture, and Christ if I could remember, but it was Mike and Doc and Franklin and me and Hank Hansen but I just remembered, you were there, too.
I wasn't there.
'Course you were.
Neither was Hank.
He raised the first flag.
It was Harlon Block that raised that one.
Shit.
I told them it was Hank.
You weren't there, Mr. Smart Ass, how'd you know it was Harlon?
-You tell them it was me?
-No.
Like I said, I just remembered.
Good, keep your mouth shut.
They know there was somebody else, you can see it in the picture.
Then pick someone dead.
They don't want somebody dead, you dumb redskin, they want to ship us back to the States.
What did I tell you?
I wasn't there.
-You hear?
-All right.
Just settle down.
-I'm not going anywhere.
-You're not going anywhere.
Who the hell says?
This is horseshit.
You wounded, son?
No, sir.
Well, did you take out a nest of Japs butt-naked with your bare hands?
'Cause if I'm gonna give up my seat to a hero he better have a good goddamn story to tell.
No, sir.
Then enjoy it, 'cause they'll forget you before Christmas.
The sixth man, you got a name?
Sorry, still don't remember.
It's a damn shame, 'cause I promised the Major you'd know who it was.
Fact, you not knowing throws a doubt on you being one of the flag-raisers yourself.
Since no one wants to be embarrassed, the moment you land they'll turn you around, ship you off to Okinawa in time to meet your buddies on the beach.
So, why don't you stop screwing with me?
Give me a damn name.
Gangway!
Gangway!
Let's go, let's go!
Gangway!
Where the hell is that son-of-a-bitch?
Hayes!
Hayes?
Hayes, get your red ass over here!
Make me look like I don't know what my own men are doing with a flag the size of my mother's house?
God damn it, Ira, you shouldn't have lied to me.
You made me look like a complete asshole.
We're gonna miss you around here.
Good luck.
Now your name's in the paper, too.
Just heard your doctor say we're postponing your operation.
You're being shipped back to the mainland.
Everybody who saw that picture thought planting the flag meant victory.
That's all they wanted to know.
Victory.
Within a few weeks of that picture being taken, half the men in it were dead.
Mrs. Hansen!
Mrs. Hansen!
Did you know Hank was a hero?
-Are you proud of him, Mrs. Hansen?
-What was he like as a boy?
Look this way, please, ma'am.
What do you have to say about your son?
But somehow being a part of it meant something.
Looking at it, you could believe their sacrifice was not a waste.
Yeah, I might have thought that was Harlon, too.
It is.
Belle, their names are right here.
It's not him.
And he would be alive and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.
You think about that when you look at his picture, Ed.
And I need to rush home and change because there's the Governor's banquet and then there's the parade.
Imagine, the Governor is coming here to meet us.
Now, I'm wearing blue so, if...
-Are you going to change?
-We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin from CBS World News.
A press association has just announced that President Roosevelt is dead.
The President died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
All we know so far is that the President died at Warm Springs in Georgia.
Further updates every hour.
Temperatures will remain the same today, in the mid-30s to low 40s with clear skies.
Hello?
Yes.
Of course.
No, we understand.
It wouldn't be right.
Thank you.
Here he is, gentlemen.
Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.
Senator Haddigan.
I'd like you to meet Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Damn good to meet you.
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.
Sorry?
That's Pima Indian talk, boy, don't you know your own language?
Took forever to memorize the damn gibberish.
Sorry, I've been away from the reservation too long, Senator.
-Doc.
-Ira.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
-That's you.
-Go, go, go, go.
Go.
Please welcome
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley,
Private First Class Ira Hayes,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon!
Holy shit.
Come in, come in, come in.
Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.
-Rene Gagnon.
-Bud Gurber.
-You showing the boys the sights?
-We saw a hell of a ball game.
That's great.
The bar's there, help yourself.
I got some briefing sheets for you here, just some simple things we want you to say.
Mostly, "Buy bonds," can't say that too often.
Itineraries, those are changing every couple minutes.
Everybody wants to meet you guys.
I got women sending up envelopes with stockings in them, notes written in lipstick.
We won't mention that to the press, am I right?
Have a drink, for Christ's sake.
My God, what you boys must have seen over there.
I've been watching the newsreels.
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.
So, we got a hell of a lot of money to raise, not a lot of time.
White House tomorrow, then we trot you over to shake hands with a couple of hundred Congressmen who won't pull a penny out of their pockets.
Politicians and actors.
You put them in a restaurant together, they'd die of old age before picking up the check.
Then New York City, Times Square, dinners with various hoi polloi, then Chicago...
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?
That's what we're calling the mothers of the dead flag-raisers.
You present each mother with a flag, they say a few words, people will shit money.
It'll be so moving.
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.
Lovely woman.
She knows how close you and her son were.
He wrote home about you.
She is very, very much looking forward to meeting you.
Hank wasn't in the picture.
Sorry?
Hank didn't raise that flag.
He raised the other one, the real flag.
The what?
The real...
The real flag?
There's a real flag?
Yeah, ours was the replacement flag.
We put it up when they took the other one down.
Am I the only one getting a headache here?
You know about this?
It was after it was already in the papers.
The mothers had already been told, but...
That's it, that's beautiful.
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Yeah, why tell me?
I'm only the guy that has to explain it to 150 million Americans.
Who is in the goddamn picture?
Are any of you guys in the goddamn picture?
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.
Six guys raising a flag over lwo Jima.
Victory is ours.
You're three of them, right?
This was the fifth day, sir.
The battle went on for 35 more.
Well, what'd you do, raise a goddamn flag every time you stopped for lunch?
Can I hit this guy?
You know what, I don't give a shit, you're in the picture, you raised the flag, that's the story we're selling, boys.
Are you deaf?
Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?
Harlon Block.
That's whose mother should be here if anyone's should be.
You know, I think this whole damn thing is a farce, you ask me.
You know what they're calling this bond drive?
The Mighty Seventh.
They might've called it the
"We're Flat Fucking Broke And Can't Even Afford Bullets
"So We're Begging For Your Pennies" bond drive, but it didn't have quite the ring.
They could've called it that, though, because the last four bond drives came up so short we just printed money instead.
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street, he'll tell you our dollar is next to worthless, we borrowed so much.
And nobody is lending any more.
Ships aren't being built.
Tanks aren't being built.
Machine guns, bazookas, hand grenades, zip.
You think this is a farce?
You want to go back to your buddies?
Well, stuff some rocks in your pockets before you get on the plane because that's all we got left to throw at the Japanese.
And don't be surprised if your plane doesn't make it off the runway because the fuel dumps are empty.
And our good friends, the Arabs, are only taking bullion.
If we don't raise $14 billion, and that's million with a "B," this war is over by the end of the month.
We make a deal with the Japanese, we give whatever they want and we come home, because you've seen them fight, and they sure as shit ain't giving up.
$14 billion.
The last three drives didn't make that much all together.
People on the street corners, they looked at this picture and they took hope.
Don't ask me why, I think it's a crappy picture myself.
You can't even see your faces.
But it said we can win this war, are winning this war, we just need you to dig a little deeper.
They want to give us that money.
No, they want to give it to you.
But you, you don't want to ask for it.
You don't want to give them hope.
You want to explain about this person and that flag.
Well, that's your choice.
Because if we admit we made a mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about and that will be that.
Gentlemen.
Mr. President, here they are.
-Well, hello.
Good to see you.
-Mr.
President.
Darn good to see you, boys.
Heard you had a hell of a fight on your hands out there, hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation in Arizona, am I right?
Yes, Mr. President.
Being an Indian, you are a truer American than any of us.
Bet your people are proud to see you wear that uniform.
Very proud, sir.
They should be.
Well, I want to thank you for coming all this way to Washington to help us out.
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific now we need you to fight for a mountain of cash.
-And I don't expect you'll let us down.
-No, sir.
Good.
Go get it.
That's the end of this ceremony.
Let's take a look at this famous photo over here, see if I can pick you out.
My gosh.
There you are.
Boys.
Boys, this one's on me.
To those who can't be with us.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon.
May we have your autograph?
I suppose.
And your name is?
I don't know about you, but I get the impression
I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.
You're such a hero.
I feel honored to be in your presence.
That's just not true.
That's professional work.
Here, to professionals.
Here they are.
You're the guys in the photograph, right?
I heard you were on the train.
Let me shake your hands, John Tennack.
John Bradley.
These boys are with me, Harvard and Yale types, didn't fight a lick.
Pappies all rich sons-of-bitches.
Boys, shake hands with some real war heroes.
Excuse me for one moment.
You can buy them a drink while you're at it.
That's right.
Drinks for these men all the way around.
And you're the other one, aren't you?
John Tennack, Tennack Homes.
-Rene Gagnon.
-Pleased to meet you.
Have a drink, come on.
And here's my card.
Listen to me, Rene, when you get finished being famous you come see me because if you can sell bonds, you can sell homes.
Now, they're not gonna build homes anymore, they're gonna deliver them.
-You heard of prefab homes?
-No, sir.
Well, you will.
And you hang on to that card and you come see me, you hear?
-All right?
-Certainly will.
All right.
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?
If Mike and the guys could see us.
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it, would they?
Harlon!
Franklin!
Can you imagine Franklin on this train
eating at the dining car with all the silver?
We shouldn't be here, Doc.
There's gonna be a Hallelujah Day
When the boys have all come home to stay
And a million bands begin to play
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
And when we've lit the torch of liberty
In each blacked-out land across the sea
Ira!
Hey, Ira!
We heard the picture was posed!
What?
We heard you posed the picture!
Hey, Doc!
We're bigger than life, Doc!
And we'll heave a mighty sigh
When each gal can kiss the boy she kissed goodbye
And they'll come marching down Fifth Avenue
The United Nations in review
When this lovely dream has all come true
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
Good job.
Thank you.
Thank you, girls!
And now, here are the men you've been waiting to meet, the men in white.
Right behind me here, the heroes of Iwo Jima,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon,
Private First Class Ira Hayes, and Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley!
Thank you.
It's good of you people to come out tonight in support of the war effort.
We really need you to buy bonds, that's for sure.
'Cause we can't win the war without your help.
As far as us being the heroes of Iwo Jima, that's just not the case.
We really didn't do much at all.
Especially him.
Especially me.
I was just a runner.
That's it.
We put up a flag.
The pole we attached it to was heavy, so it took a number of us.
We had our picture taken doing it.
The real heroes are dead on that island.
And we'd appreciate it if you bought bonds in honor of them.
Thank you.
Jump on any grenades, Ira?
Take out any machine gun nests I missed?
At least I fired my weapon.
All right, knock it off.
You hit anything or were you too drunk then, too?
What?
Guys!
Come on!
Stop it.
Knock it off.
The tall man with the high hat will be coming down your way
Get your savings out when you hear him shout
"Any bonds today?"
Any bonds today?
Bonds of freedom that's what I'm selling
Any bonds today?
Rene, right here.
Sit between these two boys.
Here comes the freedom man
Asking you to buy a share of freedom today ...for us and they need our help.
And, if you think about it, I think you'll realize that buying more bonds is not just the right thing to do but the only thing to do.
Yes, this war has gone on too long.
We have given too many lives.
And its cost...
-Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
-Strawberry.
...has been far too high.
But if we waver now, if we don't dig deep and give more than we think we can then those sacrifices would be wasted...
Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
...and those lives lost in vain.
Let's move!
Go, go!
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over.
Where the hell are our tanks?
Stuck in the sand.
Captain says you're to go without them.
Christ.
That's real good work you're doing there, Rene.
All right, prepare to move out.
Pass the word.
Second Platoon!
Move!
Move!
Move!
All right, Second Platoon, on your feet!
Let's move out!
Jackass.
Let's move out!
Go, go!
Move, move, move!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Second Platoon, move out!
Doc!
Doc, get out of there!
Corpsman!
Doc!
Doc, get the hell out of there!
May I have your attention, please.
Train number 48 with service from New York City, Boston,
Rochester, New York,
Toledo, Ohio, and South Bend, Indiana is now arriving on Track 7.
Train number 48 now arriving on Track number 7.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.
-Come on, boys.
-Let's go.
-Watch your step, ma'am.
-Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the heroes of Iwo Jima.
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.
Private First Class Ira Hayes.
And Private First Class Rene Gagnon.
Rene!
That's my boyfriend!
Who the hell is that?
I don't know.
-Rene, is that your girl?
-Hey, what do they call you?
How about a photo?
Hey, look at that!
What's your name, doll?
What's your name?
Hey, she's a beauty.
Let's go find a saloon.
Smile, boys.
Give them their money's worth.
Hey, Doc, how's the tour going for you?
Thank you.
Where exactly are you staying?
-I'm not sure yet.
-Just forget about that.
Senator, I'd like you to meet Corpsman John Bradley.
-Doc, right?
-Yes, sir.
Nice to meet you, Senator.
Good to meet you, young man.
Now, we appreciate everything you've done and everything you're doing.
-Thank you, sir.
-Quite all right.
This is Captain White.
-Colonel Johns.
-We're proud of you, Corpsman.
And then Colonel McCourtney.
-Major General Green.
-Nice to meet you.
Senator, this is Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Of course!
Now I hear you used a tomahawk on those Japs.
Is that true, Chief?
No, sir.
Well, tell them you did, makes a better story, huh?
-Attaboy.
-This is Captain Green.
John?
Madeline Evelley.
I recognize you from all the photographs.
I'm Hank's mom.
It's so nice to meet you, ma'am.
Hank was always talking about you.
This is PFC Rene Gagnon.
Pleasure to meet you, son.
Thanks for everything.
-My pleasure.
-Not at all.
Ira, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Strank, Mike's mom.
It's all right.
When I got the telegram, I...
I don't know what I'm trying to say here.
Knowing he was with you that day and seeing him in that photograph,
I don't know why it makes me feel better, but it does.
-It's so silly, isn't it?
-No, it's not.
How are you, son?
Thank you very much.
We're the largest furniture wholesaler in Illinois.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
-I'll make sure he calls.
-Well, thank you.
Thank you.
Are you Rene?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Franklin's mother.
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.
I'm Pauline, Rene's girlfriend.
Would you mind?
Paper said that's Hank, and I honestly can't tell.
It's horrible of a mother not to know her own son, isn't it?
But that's him, isn't it?
Well, to be honest, ma'am, it happened so quick, and with everything that was going on it's kind of hard to remember who was where.
But...
Yeah, I think...
I think that's where he was.
That's Hank.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Excuse us.
Take him outside.
I'm Pauline.
-Very nice to meet you.
-Hi, nice to meet you.
He was the best Marine I ever knew.
Thank you.
-You okay, Chief?
-Oh, Christ!
I'm okay.
Yeah, you look it.
You're gonna screw this up, aren't you?
You're gonna screw it up for all of us.
I've got him.
Get some sleep, Ira.
-Mike?
-Yeah?
-You see this?
-What?
-Mike!
-Oh, shit, go!
He's killing me!
Hey, Doc, you think they got them all?
What?
Well, they're not shooting at us.
Maybe we killed them all.
Or they ran off in the night or something.
Or they're waiting for us to start climbing.
Third Platoon!
Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.
-Just us?
-Yeah, just us, lgg.
All right, Third Platoon, move!
I tag along?
Yeah, you can lead the way if you want.
Get a good shot of my face.
It's your ass I'm gonna make famous, Hank.
Hey, that'll work for me, too.
Lieutenant, if you make it to the top, put this up.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, Iggy.
They never shoot at the first patrol.
-They don't?
-No.
They want us to go up to the top, signal to the others that it's okay, then shoot everybody else as they come up the mountain.
-Really?
-Yeah.
Unless of course they want to make an example of us and discourage all the others.
I think you're full of crap, you know that, Hank?
Really?
Jesus.
Thank God that ain't us.
Told you.
Boots, spread them out and put them on a line.
Set up a perimeter!
First Squad!
-Hank?
Find me a pole.
-Yeah.
Let's put this flag up.
Watch it.
Right over here.
Right here.
That's good.
That's good.
Right here, right here.
Got that end?
Hold that steady.
Lindberg.
-Hey, who's got rope?
-Right here.
Give me something.
Yeah, good.
That work?
Do it, fellas.
Keep it coming.
USMC!
USMC!
Shit, look at that!
Jeez, look at that.
Get down!
Take cover!
Cover with that .30!
-Watch it!
Twenty yards down, Hank!
-You see them?
-I got about 20 yards, left side.
-Lindberg, get the flamethrower!
-Boots, you see them?
-Cover right!
-About 20 yards down!
Duck one!
-You see them?
Keep the cover on!
Second Squad, you see them?
Get me some grenades!
I see them!
You see them?
Right flank, over to the right!
Cover me, I'm going down!
Careful, Iggy.
Easy.
All clear!
Okay, guys, who wants to be famous?
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
-God damn it.
Strank!
-Sir?
They want a phone line run up to the top of the mountain.
Let me guess, they picked us.
Second Platoon, let's go.
Get some exercise.
Let's go!
Get off your ass.
Oh, shit!
Hope it still works, 'cause you're not getting mine!
-Get Forrestal!
-All right, then.
I don't know whose idea it was, Mr. Secretary.
Well, it was goddamn brilliant.
I want that flag, Holland.
Mark my words, raising that son-of-a-bitch means a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.
I want that flag.
Yes, sir.
I'll make sure no one touches it.
You can count on me.
Fuck that.
That flag belongs to the men in this battalion.
That son-of-a-bitch thinks that our men died taking this ground so we could hand over our flag to some politician to pin to his wall?
He's out of his goddamn mind!
Get me that flag, and find another one to replace it.
You've gotta be shitting me.
Gagnon!
Get your ass over here.
Hey.
Hi, fellas.
How's it going?
Missed a beautiful shot, Joe.
It's that kind of day.
-Hey, Mike.
-Hell of a view, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant!
Captain says he wants that flag.
He wants this flag?
Yes, sir.
-We just put the damn thing up.
-Yes, sir.
Some kind of flag shortage?
He wants you to put this one up instead.
Hey, Mike.
Do me a favor and put this up, will you?
Yes, sir.
All right, let's find a pole.
Take the flag down, boys.
Captain's orders.
You heard him, let's do it.
There you go.
Lordy, she's a heavy one.
All right, hang on.
Put this on.
One hell of a view, huh?
Good view from up here.
Yes, I'd say so myself.
All right.
-Not in your way here, am I, Joe?
-Nah, I'm fine, thanks.
Hey, Doc, you wanna give us a hand here?
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.
Ready?
Ready?
Let's go.
You get it?
I don't know.
I wish I could've seen their faces.
Nobody even noticed that second flag going up.
Everybody saw that damn picture and made up their own story about it.
But your dad and the others knew what they had done and what they had not done.
All your friends dying, it's hard not to be called a hero for saving somebody's life.
But for putting up a pole?
You gotta be kidding.
Hey!
It took a lot of talented folks a long time to make that thing.
Just wait till tonight when it's lit properly and there's thousands of cheering people in the stands.
It's gonna look a lot better.
So, stadium lights come down, spotlight comes up and you get your cue.
You charge up this thing with the flag, you plant it at the top.
You smile, you wave.
You know the drill.
You want us to plant the flag on a pile of papier-mâché.
Hey, that's show biz.
And try and stand how you stood the first time you planted it.
Just, you know, pretend the other three guys are with you.
The dead guys.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, not a problem.
Good.
But where do we imagine Hank is standing?
Sorry?
Well, seeing that he wasn't there, it'll be kind of hard for us to leave a space for him.
I think you know exactly where he was.
You pointed him out to his mother.
This is bullshit.
I planted that damn thing once, and I'm not doing it again.
-Hayes!
-Oh, for Christ's sake.
Hayes.
Hayes, get your ass back here or you're going on report.
Hayes!
You wanna do your damn job?
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Come on!
He's with me!
Hey, he's with me!
-Back off!
-Sir, he's with me.
Okay?
He's with me.
Ira, put the goddamn chair down!
-Put the chair down, son!
-Put the chair down, Ira!
Tell them drop their sticks!
Ira, they're cops, they're supposed to have nightsticks.
You're not supposed to be in the street swinging a chair.
-Calm down, son.
-Sir, turn around, please.
That poster right there?
The one on the end, that's him.
-That's him?
-Yes, sir.
You read the papers?
Christ.
We got another fucking hero.
Get him out of here.
-Can you do that?
-Yes, sir.
Put the goddamn chair down.
And let's go.
Did you start this?
He didn't serve me!
I don't make the rules.
We don't serve Indians.
He needs to go sleep it off.
Soldier Field.
You hear that?
What the hell is that?
I can't figure it out.
Keep an eye out.
It sounds like it's coming from up there.
They're using grenades.
They're killing themselves.
Ira, let's go.
Come on.
Let's go, Ira.
Come on.
Thank God.
Jesus.
Look at you, Chief.
You found him.
Holy shit.
You would have to pick today.
Vandegrift is here with enough brass to start a fucking band.
Come on, let's go.
Can you walk?
-Yes, sir.
-By yourself?
All right, look.
I don't care if you have to carry him get him to the top, plant that flag, and don't fucking fall off.
Get him in his stuff.
I'll stall these guys for as long as I can.
Hurry up.
Jesus Christ.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Cover!
Harlon!
Harlon!
Get your fire team up in that position!
O'Hare!
First Fire Team!
Work around!
BAR, you, on the side of the ridge!
Covering fire, boys, go, go, go!
Jackson, work your team around to the left!
Cover!
Left flank!
Left flank!
Franklin, Gust, go check it out!
Hustle up, boys!
We got them!
Clear!
One hell of an experience.
Move out!
Cease fire!
They're my men!
You're targeting our men!
You're targeting our...
Get me another radio!
Sergeant?
Sergeant!
Mike!
Mike, Mike, Mike.
Mike?
Mike.
Hey, where's Doc?
Corpsman!
Oh, shit.
How's his breathing?
Harlon, move, buddy.
Hey, Mike.
Mike, Mike, can you hear us?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on, Mike.
Mike?
Mike, can you hear us?
All right, let's go!
Move out!
I'm gonna get a stretcher.
Let's take him down, move him off the beach.
Ladies and gentlemen, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Corpsman!
Hank!
Hank!
Doc, they killed me.
Harlon!
Doc, they killed me.
Come on, Harlon.
Harlon, stay with me.
Franklin!
I'm fine, Ira.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
-Where'd he go?
-Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
-I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
-I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Does it open?
Iggy!
Iggy!
Iggy, are you down there?
Iggy!
Can't tell who it is, but he's one of ours.
I had to go outside to throw up.
Look what they did to the poor son-of-a-bitch.
You okay, Chief?
Just let it go.
If that doesn't pry open their wallets, nothing will.
Jesus Christ, he's drunk.
Goddamn Indians.
Come on, Chief.
Let's get you home.
That's not what I hear.
I called around, I'm not stupid.
He's been drunk since he started this damn tour, making a spectacle of himself.
Just about choked that poor woman at the reception, blubbering.
Jesus Christ, you're supposed to be watching these men.
Yes, sir.
Well, he's making us look like regular asses.
Well, with all due respect, sir, he never wanted to come on this trip in the first place.
We had to pull him, kicking and screaming, off that boat.
He wants to be with his unit.
What unit?
They're all fucking dead.
This is how he honors those men?
By drinking and throwing up, and...
You know what?
He wants it, great, we'll send him back.
Get him packed and on a train today.
He's an embarrassment to the uniform.
Yes, sir.
I'll do it.
Yeah, no, that's...
That's good.
That's what I want.
I know it's a good thing, raising the money and that, 'cause we need it.
But,
I can't take them calling me a hero.
All I did was try not to get shot.
Some of the things I saw done, things I did,
they weren't things to be proud of, you know?
Mike...
Mike was a hero.
You ever meet him?
No.
Best Marine I ever met.
You know, Chief, I think if Mike was sitting here instead of you he'd be saying the same thing about himself,
not being a hero.
Maybe.
He was a good guy.
But I think that he would be ashamed of me, seeing me the way I am.
Think I could see my ma before they ship me off?
Think they'd do that?
See my ma?
I'm sorry, Ira.
We got stories now to tell our kids, I guess.
Keep your head down.
All aboard.
Good luck, Chief.
I think I saw him once after that.
It was maybe six or seven years after the war.
I was working as a salesman, doing a lot of driving.
I was driving west across Texas.
I was just trying to get where I was going so I could get home.
And I saw this guy hitchhiking on the side of the road.
And, for a second, I thought it might've been him.
I always regret that I didn't stop, but I was in a hurry.
And he was an Indian.
We always told the press that Ira insisted that he was going back to fight with his unit which was at least partially true, but
that isn't what got the headlines.
We're engaged.
Excuse me a minute, darling.
-Hey, Doc?
-Yeah?
-Got a minute?
-Yeah.
I'll see you at the car.
-You hear I'm getting married?
-I did, Rene.
That's great.
Yeah, it's something she wants.
She waited for me all this time.
She's not used to all this, but she's a good girl.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
So, I was wondering if you'd be my best man.
Me?
Don't you have somebody at home, a buddy, you'd rather ask?
Well, I didn't really make many.
The ones who didn't go, it's...
Well, it's hard to even talk to them.
You know?
Yeah, I know.
I'd be proud to.
Thank you.
I better go drag her away from them before she announces
I'm gonna be president of General Motors or something.
All right.
-Congratulations.
-Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Rene, you're a lucky man.
-Big smile, Mrs. Gagnon!
-Say cheese!
I couldn't complain because the press loved them, so they wrote more articles and people bought more bonds.
The tour went on with just Rene and your dad.
And the true heroes are the men who didn't make it home from lwo Jima, the men who died at Iwo Jima and in other campaigns.
We ask that you honor the memory of those men by buying the war bonds and helping us to win this war.
Thank you.
City after city, I thought the damn thing'd never end.
And this rumor kept going around that the photograph had been staged.
I remember your dad telling them that he wished he'd known he was having his picture taken because he would've ducked the hell out of it.
Whose idea was it?
Who wanted to stage the thing?
Come on, it was you?
Was there truth to the rumor that that picture was staged, Doc?
-Come on!
Doc?
-Can you answer that?
I remember when your dad got shot.
All hell was busting loose.
People back home saw that picture and thought it was over when we took Suribachi.
We wished.
Anyways, we're pinned down.
Mortars, shells, machine guns.
Fire coming from every which direction, right?
And we hear somebody call, "Corpsman down."
Corpsman down!
Blood was spurting out of his throat, and Doc was doing everything he could.
And the Corpsman looks up at him and he knows what this means, to be shot in the neck.
He knows he's dying, you can see that.
But still in his eyes, he's pleading with Doc to save his life.
And Doc can't.
-You okay, Doc?
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-Yeah, you look fine.
-I'm okay.
Keep down, all right?
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.
Okay.
Corpsman.
Corpsman!
For God sake, Corpsman!
Corpsman?
Corpsman.
Incoming!
Let me see.
It's not that bad.
You're gonna be okay.
All right?
Just stay with me.
Look at me.
Took us a half-hour to find your dad.
He could've bled to death.
Coming down.
Thanks.
Vets'll tell you about being hit but not wanting to leave their buddies.
Usually, they're lying.
You'll take any excuse to get out of there.
But it happens.
You get the feeling you're letting them down.
I could see that in your dad's face.
He wanted to go, he'd seen enough.
But he didn't want to leave us.
Now, he was a hell of a good man, your dad.
Yeah.
While we were sitting there on the beach, we heard this great roar.
And we looked up.
That was the first of thousands of landings on Iwo.
-Look at that.
-Yeah.
How about that.
I'm gonna head back, all right?
Good luck.
That island saved a lot of lives.
A lot of lives.
I don't know what else to tell you.
After the bond tour my dad finally got his operation.
By the time he got home the war was over.
First thing he did was ask my mom to marry him.
Ira tried to get on with his life and put it all behind him.
Thank you for having me here today.
It's an honor to be in front of such a strong people.
Because of the war white men will understand Indians a lot better.
And it's going to be a better world.
But life had other plans for him.
You're...
You're him, aren't you?
You're the hero, right?
Great.
All right, kids, go get your picture taken.
Oh, that's great.
That's great.
All right, now say cheese.
Cheese!
That's great!
Okay.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Thanks.
-Come on.
-That's a hero, kids.
Hero, lift this basket, will you?
It's too heavy for me.
Rene tried to take advantage of those offers he'd received on the bond tour.
Yes.
G-A-G-N-O-N.
Right.
Pronounced Rene.
Rene, yes.
-Okay, I actually called last week.
-Yes.
Okay, yes.
Mr. Gagnon.
I gave Mr. Tennack your message.
I'm sure he'll call you.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
But he was yesterday's hero.
He even applied for a job at the local police station.
They said he wasn't qualified.
After working the factory with Pauline he tried a few things but spent the rest of his life as a janitor.
But Ira...
Ira!
You got a visitor.
Ira always made the news.
I could never find out why he did it, but one day Ira just took off.
He walked and hitched over 1,300 miles from Arizona to Texas.
He found Harlon Block's father working his field.
His wife, Belle, had left him soon after they discovered Harlon died.
She never forgave him for letting her son go off to war.
And Ira told him the truth, that it had been his son who raised the flag with them, his son in the photograph.
And then he just turned and walked away.
Though the flag-raising meant nothing to him, he somehow knew it would mean everything to them.
Thanks for calling.
Just as Belle knew all along.
The press soon found out and called Hank's mom with the news that it wasn't her son after all.
The last time they all saw each other was at the unveiling of the Marine Corps War Memorial.
And even though he planted the first flag above lwo Jima,
Hank's mother and father weren't invited.
Ira.
It's good to see you, Ira.
Hell of a statue.
It wasn't long after that that they found Ira.
The papers said he died of exposure.
There was no autopsy.
It was about that same time when my father got in his car early one morning telling my mom he had something to do.
He drove to a town on the other side of Wisconsin where Iggy's mom lived.
Ever since she heard the news about her son she'd been trying to find out how he died, and no one would tell her.
I never found out what he told her, but I can pretty much guarantee it wasn't the truth.
My mother would ask him what was troubling him.
He would never say.
And every year, as it got close to Memorial Day, the reporters would start calling asking to interview my father.
No, I'm sorry.
He's fishing in Canada.
We were always instructed to say the same thing.
Okay.
Thanks.
When Mr. McCandless retired, my father bought the funeral home where he'd worked since coming home.
He spent the rest of his life running the business and raising his family.
He never spoke about the war or about the flag-raising, never told us anything.
The first time I heard any of these stories was after he died.
Where is he?
Oh, God.
He's not here, Dad.
He died.
Who?
Who died?
Iggy.
Iggy.
Christ, poor lggy.
I hadn't thought of him for years.
How do you know about Iggy?
You were calling for him, when you collapsed.
I wasn't looking for Iggy.
I was looking for you.
I wanted to...
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry I wasn't a better father.
Talked to you more.
I just...
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
You were the best father a man could have.
Did I ever tell you they took us swimming?
No, Dad.
After we planted the flag, we came down off the mountain and they let us swim.
It was the funniest thing.
All this fighting and we were jumping around in the water like kids.
That's the way I remember lggy now.
I finally came to the conclusion that maybe he was right.
Maybe there's no such thing as heroes.
Maybe there are just people like my dad.
I finally came to understand why they were so uncomfortable being called heroes.
Heroes are something we create, something we need.
It's a way for us to understand what is almost incomprehensible, how people could sacrifice so much for us.
But for my dad and these men, the risks they took, the wounds they suffered, they did that for their buddies.
They may have fought for their country, but they died for their friends.
For the man in front, for the man beside them.
And if we wish to truly honor these men, we should remember them the way they really were, the way my dad remembered them.
Come on, Doc!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
For God sakes!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Honey, what's wrong?
Every jackass thinks he knows what war is.
Especially those who've never been in one.
We like things nice and simple, good and evil, heroes and villains.
There's always plenty of both.
Most of the time, they are not who we think they are.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where...
Where is he?
Where is he?
Mr. Bradley?
Mr. B?
You okay?
- Where is he?
- Where is who?
Where is he?
Where did he go?
Where...
Where is he?
All right.
Just stay right here, okay?
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
It'll be okay.
Where is he?
Most guys I knew would never talk about what happened over there.
Probably 'cause they're still trying to forget about it.
They certainly didn't think of themselves as heroes.
They died without glory.
Nobody has taken their pictures.
Only their buddies knew what they did.
I'd tell their folks they died for their country.
I'm not sure that was it.
Now, there were plenty other photos taken that day, but none anybody wanted to see.
What we see and do in war, the cruelty, is unbelievable.
But somehow we gotta make some sense of it.
To do that, we need a easy to understand truth and damn few words.
Film's ruined.
I don't know.
This one looks all right.
And if you can get a picture...
Now, the right picture can win or lose a war.
You're gonna want to see this.
Look at Vietnam.
The picture of that South Vietnamese officer blowing that fella's brains out of the side of his head, whammo!
That was it.
The war was lost.
We just hung around trying to pretend it wasn't.
Took a lot of other pictures that day.
None of them made a difference.
Thanks.
Appreciate it.
Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.
Country was bankrupt.
People were becoming cynical and tired of war.
Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon!
Where?
Right there.
Planting that flag, that's your brother.
Ma, all you can see is his behind.
And that's his.
I powdered and diapered it, I know my son.
That's him.
Go get your father.
Daddy, Ma's got a picture of Harlon's keister in the paper.
You watch your mouth, young man.
Thank you.
One photo, almost all on its own, turned that around.
It's on the front page of every major paper.
Over 200 dailies and they're all flooded with requests for prints.
I think we might have found it.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- I gotta go get him.
- Oh, no, you don't.
Iggy, I gotta go.
I have a whole different theory.
He wants medical attention bad enough, he'll come to us.
Shut up and crawl over here, you lazy son-of-a-bitch!
As soon as that flare goes out.
- Crap.
Okay, well, I'll go with you.
- No.
You're actually gonna leave me here?
I'll be right back, just shoot some people.
I gotta go.
Oh, God.
Okay, it's okay.
Don't touch them.
Don't touch them.
Get your hands out of there.
Let me do that.
I'll do it, okay?
Don't look.
Keep your head back.
Keep your eyes on me.
All right, look at me.
I'll get it.
I'll take care of it.
We'll get this bandage on you.
We'll get you taken care of.
And we'll get you down to the bottom, all right?
Look, you're gonna be fine.
It's okay.
I'll do that.
I'll do that.
Here, put some pressure on that.
Put your hands on top and put some pressure on it.
Keep your head back.
Keep breathing.
Keep looking at me, all right?
Just keep looking at...
Doc.
Help me.
Help me.
All right.
Okay.
How's that feel?
- It feels good.
- It does?
All right.
- Good.
- All right.
I'm gonna go get a stretcher and get you down to the beach.
I'll be right back.
I'm all right.
Go and help someone who's hurt.
All right.
Hold on there.
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Holy shit.
They expect us to climb this?
Or something just like it.
So, where you think they're sending us?
I think it's the desert, Franklin.
Well, that makes no sense at all.
Well, it's just military psychology.
They always train you for the desert on a volcano.
Now you're just having fun with me.
Harlon, take your men right.
- Watch for Bedouins.
- Yes, sir.
- What's a Bedouin?
- It's a guy with a camel.
Well, Jeez Louise, maybe we are going to the desert.
Now, you tilt that to the right, but what if the bullet comes from the left?
Bullets don't come from the left.
You know any left-handed Japs?
That makes about as much sense as you showering with your shoes on.
You don't even know why you do it, do you?
'Cause I don't tell you mean I don't know?
You do it 'cause Mike does it.
I'll ask him.
So you cut hair back home?
Some.
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?
No, I just studied it a little.
But not in barber school?
Nope.
- Gosh.
- Let me guess, Hayes is winning.
Chief, I had very little to do with Sitting Bull's death, so maybe you could stop taking it out on me.
Different tribe.
The Pimas fought on the side of the white man.
- See, now that's smart.
- That is smart.
Yeah.
Worked real good for us.
Good luck, fellas.
Hey, good night, Lindberg.
Dead bodies.
He cuts hair on dead bodies.
What?
Even I knew that.
- Who's in?
- Oh, I'm in.
I'm in.
It must be a lot easier with them not moving around and all.
- There's that.
- Yeah.
You know what I been thinking?
Well, they been telling us we need to buddy up and I think we'd make pretty good buddies.
And how do you figure that?
Well, you know, in that we have a lot in common.
So, why do you cut dead people's hair, anyway?
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.
You tell a lot of people that?
You actually chose the Marines because they got the best uniform?
No sense being a hero if you don't look like one.
Jacks.
Queens.
Shit.
Do anything on that reservation but play cards, Chief?
All right, listen up, you sorry bunch of leathernecks!
We practice going over the side tomorrow which means we ain't long for this piece of rock.
All right!
One more thing, any man who doesn't have his masturbation papers in order better get them signed by tomorrow night or he ain't going overseas.
- I got mine already.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm square.
Wait.
Why am I just hearing about this?
That's horseshit, Franklin.
I don't have to repeat everything twice for you.
No, I didn't hear nothing about no masturbating papers.
Heard they were running short.
You know, nobody tells me nothing.
That's real nice, guys.
All right, get your ass over to the officer in charge of records.
Maybe he got some more left.
- Leave your smokes.
I'll play for you.
- Thanks, Mike.
Listen, he calls you an idiot, you take it like a man, okay?
Just do not leave without signing them.
- I appreciate it, Sergeant.
- You got it.
What the hell happened to your hair, Rene?
Look like a goddamn corpse.
Three points of contact on that rope at all times.
Next four.
Over the side.
Let's go.
Keep moving.
Next four, over the side.
Just keep your eye on the guy below you.
That's all you gotta look at.
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.
Keep three points of contact on the rope at all times.
You see?
No big thing.
Just one step at a time and keep your hands on the vertical rope.
Remember, once you're in the boat move away from the rope.
Just make sure you keep three points of contact on the rope.
I got him!
All right, get that man out of the water.
Give me a hand.
Grab his pack.
Don't worry about him, Doc.
All right, quit skylarking!
Keep it moving!
He'll be fine.
Our target, Island X, is an ugly, smelly, dirty little scab of rock called Iwo Jima.
It means "Sulfur Island," which accounts for the smell.
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop, you ask me.
After 20 straight days of bombing you won't find a blade of grass or a twig on it.
It wasn't that pretty to start with.
Captain?
Iwo's just five-and-a-half miles long, two-and-a-half wide.
There's a lump down at the bottom.
That's Mount Suribachi.
On the maps in front of you the island is white.
Not much of it.
The black dots represent known enemy emplacements.
Coastal defense guns, dual-mount dual-purpose guns, covered artillery emplacements.
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes, and earth-covered structures.
I don't see any barracks or any other structures.
That's right.
And we still don't know why.
Now, this isn't just any island to them.
This isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, or Saipan.
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders in eight square miles.
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.
It's up to us to convince them.
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.
The 8th Ammo Company will land here to re-supply.
The Suribachi's guns are the biggest problem.
They can hit any point on the island.
We're sitting ducks until we take them out.
That's our job.
We cut across the island, right at the base, slit its throat, lop off its head.
And we take that mountain.
We take that mountain, we take their big guns.
We take their eyes.
Okay, I'm heading in.
Follow me.
Let's put a good show on for the Marines.
Close it up.
Take it right down to the deck.
Yeah, boys!
Man overboard portside!
See him?
Throw me a line!
He's right there.
- Where is he?
- Watch out, watch out, watch out.
Hawaii's that way!
Just keep paddling, Mac, we'll catch you on the way back!
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!
They're not gonna stop.
What?
None of them are.
They can't.
So much for "No man left behind. "
- Sir.
- Come on in.
Look, I've had to make a few other changes.
I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
- You bet.
Trouble is, I already told my men I'd see them through this.
That your James Cagney impersonation?
'Cause I've heard better.
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.
Look, this isn't your first time through this.
- You don't need to prove anything.
- No, sir.
You're not the best sergeant I've ever had, you're just the best one that's still walking.
- Block's a good man.
- Yes, sir, he is.
The men know him, he can step right in.
You know, I have actually thought this through.
Platoon sergeant puts you further away from the bullets.
I already gave them my word, sir.
I told them I'd bring them all home to their mothers which means I already lied to half of them.
Can't lie to the rest.
- How are your men?
- They'll do fine.
Except maybe Gagnon.
Our own Tyrone Power?
Yes, sir.
He's a good man, just might be better use further back from the lines.
I'll use him as a runner.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
Now get out of here.
Hear the good news, Doc?
We're going in with the first waves.
Hey, you do that again I'll take your head off!
Fucking dominoes.
Iggy, have you ever heard news you considered to be bad?
The first ones off the ship, Doc.
Means we don't go over the side of the ship.
We hop on a tractor, they drive us right there.
Oh, shit, that is good news.
You see?
What'd I tell you?
What's going on?
Look at that.
We're killing them!
We're killing them, Doc.
I was promised 10 days of shelling.
You're giving me three and saying that's the best you can do?
I don't give a shit!
My men hit that beach with less than 10 and I'll be taking them home to their mamas in buckets!
Yeah, I know exactly why.
Because every Navy man with a scrambled egg on his chest wants to offload us here and sail to Japan so they can be there for the big finish, tell their kids they captured the Emperor all by themselves.
Well, you aren't going to Japan unless we take this piece of shit island!
These little pricks are dug in!
Okay, appreciate that, Jim.
Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
I'm okay.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
Jesus, Iggy, just leave me alone, all right?
How about you guys?
Knife?
Bayonet?
Kick in the ass?
How about you, Doc?
Sharpen your knife?
You sharpened it three times already.
Well, then I better make sure I didn't nick it.
Good man, Doc.
- Hey, Doc.
- Yeah.
When we land, try not to wave this kit around too much.
They got sharpshooters that are trained to look for them.
And they know that if they take out a corpsman another dozen Marines will die unattended.
All right?
Okay, Mike.
Yeah, right there.
Close the damn door.
For God's sake.
Yeah, like that's gonna help.
That your girlfriend, Chief?
Bet she's a pretty damn good-looking squaw.
Bet you're missing her, and that little wigwam of yours.
Welcome, all Marines off Iwo Jima.
We have a long-time wait...
It's what they do to prisoners,
- at least the lucky ones.
- Jesus.
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think about waving a white bandanna.
Poor Marines, so far from home for no good reason.
Think of your girls back home, waiting for you.
But a girl cannot stay home every night.
So who do you think they're with tonight?
And will she let him kiss her?
And will he comfort her at your funeral?
This sweet music is to make you think of your girls back home who are missing you.
This is all for now.
I'll see you tomorrow night.
Gunners!
Move, let's go!
Let's go, get up on the berm!
Gunners!
We're clear!
Get up the berm!
Baker Company, move out!
- Seen Second Platoon?
- I don't see them.
First Squad, move it out!
God, this place reeks.
- Go, go, go!
- Move out!
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go!
Go!
Go, go!
Drop your packs!
Go!
All clear!
- Jesus, you needed some exercise?
- He got lost.
A hundred landing craft heading for one beach and this guy gets lost.
Now I'm glad we did.
Jesus, what a mess.
Any theories why they ain't shooting?
It's getting on my nerves.
Maybe they're all dead.
What do you think, Doc?
You think they're all dead?
Mike, take six men and bring that gun onto the beach.
Second Platoon, let's move out!
Stay down.
Come on.
Move!
Move!
- Get down!
- Take cover!
Move out!
Cover fire!
Pour it on!
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!
Corpsman!
I'm gonna sling your arm and then I'll give you a shot for the pain!
Move, move!
Off the beach!
Take cover!
You got a girl back home, Marine?
We're gonna make sure she sees you, all right?
I need pressure on this wound!
Where's the fire coming from?
Where are they?
Look for a flash, shoot at it!
Let's go, let...
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!
You're over!
Third Squad, forward!
Move!
Where are they, sir?
We got ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock, pillbox!
Sergeant!
- Sergeant!
I think I can clear that out.
- What?
All right, you go.
Here.
Take these.
Check your weapon.
Yeah?
Go!
Cover!
Cover him!
Cover, cover!
Son-of-a-bitch.
Let's go!
Go!
Move it out!
Go, go, go!
Down, down, down!
It's clear.
Good work.
I thought you said it was clear!
It was!
Shit, I guess they're not in there firing at us then.
Lindberg!
Yeah!
Light it up!
I'll cover you, Ice!
Don't cover shit!
There's already enough people shooting!
One bullet and this thing goes up like a Roman candle!
Go!
Shift fire!
Shift your fire!
Go, go!
Shift your fire!
Shift your fire!
Go!
Move it out!
Hit the deck!
Stay down!
Wait for support!
Is this a bad battle or what?
It's a fucking slaughter.
Christ Jesus!
Get a machine gun team set up over here, now!
Thank God!
Tanks!
Runner!
Get those tanks up here!
Oh, shit.
Get down!
Corporal, watch your left flank!
Let's go without them!
Move out!
Move out!
Iggy, you gotta lift your side, he's gonna roll off.
Got it, Doc!
Incoming!
Move, move, move, move!
Keep moving!
Get that LVT up on the beach!
Keep moving!
You're next, pal, we're getting you out of here.
Move it!
Great news.
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa, 'cause that's where we're headed.
Not you and me.
Captain Severance asked me who else was in that picture, and Christ if I could remember, but it was Mike and Doc and Franklin and me and Hank Hansen but I just remembered, you were there, too.
I wasn't there.
'Course you were.
Neither was Hank.
He raised the first flag.
It was Harlon Block that raised that one.
Shit.
I told them it was Hank.
You weren't there, Mr. Smart Ass, how'd you know it was Harlon?
- You tell them it was me?
- No.
Like I said, I just remembered.
Good, keep your mouth shut.
They know there was somebody else, you can see it in the picture.
Then pick someone dead.
They don't want somebody dead, you dumb redskin, they want to ship us back to the States.
What did I tell you?
I wasn't there.
- You hear?
- All right.
Just settle down.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're not going anywhere.
Who the hell says?
This is horseshit.
You wounded, son?
No, sir.
Well, did you take out a nest of Japs butt-naked with your bare hands?
'Cause if I'm gonna give up my seat to a hero he better have a good goddamn story to tell.
No, sir.
Then enjoy it, 'cause they'll forget you before Christmas.
The sixth man, you got a name?
Sorry, still don't remember.
It's a damn shame, 'cause I promised the Major you'd know who it was.
Fact, you not knowing throws a doubt on you being one of the flag-raisers yourself.
Since no one wants to be embarrassed, the moment you land they'll turn you around, ship you off to Okinawa in time to meet your buddies on the beach.
So, why don't you stop screwing with me?
Give me a damn name.
Gangway!
Gangway!
Let's go, let's go!
Gangway!
Where the hell is that son-of-a-bitch?
Hayes!
Hayes?
Hayes, get your red ass over here!
Make me look like I don't know what my own men are doing with a flag the size of my mother's house?
God damn it, Ira, you shouldn't have lied to me.
You made me look like a complete asshole.
We're gonna miss you around here.
Good luck.
Now your name's in the paper, too.
Just heard your doctor say we're postponing your operation.
You're being shipped back to the mainland.
Everybody who saw that picture thought planting the flag meant victory.
That's all they wanted to know.
Victory.
Within a few weeks of that picture being taken, half the men in it were dead.
Mrs. Hansen!
Mrs. Hansen!
Did you know Hank was a hero?
- Are you proud of him, Mrs. Hansen?
- What was he like as a boy?
Look this way, please, ma'am.
What do you have to say about your son?
But somehow being a part of it meant something.
Looking at it, you could believe their sacrifice was not a waste.
Yeah, I might have thought that was Harlon, too.
It is.
Belle, their names are right here.
It's not him.
And he would be alive and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.
You think about that when you look at his picture, Ed.
And I need to rush home and change because there's the Governor's banquet and then there's the parade.
Imagine, the Governor is coming here to meet us.
Now, I'm wearing blue so, if...
- Are you going to change?
- We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin from CBS World News.
A press association has just announced that President Roosevelt is dead.
The President died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
All we know so far is that the President died at Warm Springs in Georgia.
Further updates every hour.
Temperatures will remain the same today, in the mid-30s to low 40s with clear skies.
Hello?
Yes.
Of course.
No, we understand.
It wouldn't be right.
Thank you.
Here he is, gentlemen.
Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.
Senator Haddigan.
I'd like you to meet Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Damn good to meet you.
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.
Sorry?
That's Pima Indian talk, boy, don't you know your own language?
Took forever to memorize the damn gibberish.
Sorry, I've been away from the reservation too long, Senator.
- Doc.
- Ira.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
- That's you.
- Go, go, go, go.
Go.
Please welcome
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley,
Private First Class Ira Hayes,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon!
Holy shit.
Come in, come in, come in.
Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Bud Gurber.
- You showing the boys the sights?
- We saw a hell of a ball game.
That's great.
The bar's there, help yourself.
I got some briefing sheets for you here, just some simple things we want you to say.
Mostly, "Buy bonds," can't say that too often.
Itineraries, those are changing every couple minutes.
Everybody wants to meet you guys.
I got women sending up envelopes with stockings in them, notes written in lipstick.
We won't mention that to the press, am I right?
Have a drink, for Christ's sake.
My God, what you boys must have seen over there.
I've been watching the newsreels.
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.
So, we got a hell of a lot of money to raise, not a lot of time.
White House tomorrow, then we trot you over to shake hands with a couple of hundred Congressmen who won't pull a penny out of their pockets.
Politicians and actors.
You put them in a restaurant together, they'd die of old age before picking up the check.
Then New York City, Times Square, dinners with various hoi polloi, then Chicago...
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?
That's what we're calling the mothers of the dead flag-raisers.
You present each mother with a flag, they say a few words, people will shit money.
It'll be so moving.
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.
Lovely woman.
She knows how close you and her son were.
He wrote home about you.
She is very, very much looking forward to meeting you.
Hank wasn't in the picture.
Sorry?
Hank didn't raise that flag.
He raised the other one, the real flag.
The what?
The real...
The real flag?
There's a real flag?
Yeah, ours was the replacement flag.
We put it up when they took the other one down.
Am I the only one getting a headache here?
You know about this?
It was after it was already in the papers.
The mothers had already been told, but...
That's it, that's beautiful.
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Yeah, why tell me?
I'm only the guy that has to explain it to 150 million Americans.
Who is in the goddamn picture?
Are any of you guys in the goddamn picture?
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.
Six guys raising a flag over Iwo Jima.
Victory is ours.
You're three of them, right?
This was the fifth day, sir.
The battle went on for 35 more.
Well, what'd you do, raise a goddamn flag every time you stopped for lunch?
Can I hit this guy?
You know what, I don't give a shit, you're in the picture, you raised the flag, that's the story we're selling, boys.
Are you deaf?
Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?
Harlon Block.
That's whose mother should be here if anyone's should be.
You know, I think this whole damn thing is a farce, you ask me.
You know what they're calling this bond drive?
The Mighty Seventh.
They might've called it the
"We're Flat Fucking Broke And Can't Even Afford Bullets
"So We're Begging For Your Pennies" bond drive, but it didn't have quite the ring.
They could've called it that, though, because the last four bond drives came up so short we just printed money instead.
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street, he'll tell you our dollar is next to worthless, we borrowed so much.
And nobody is lending any more.
Ships aren't being built.
Tanks aren't being built.
Machine guns, bazookas, hand grenades, zip.
You think this is a farce?
You want to go back to your buddies?
Well, stuff some rocks in your pockets before you get on the plane because that's all we got left to throw at the Japanese.
And don't be surprised if your plane doesn't make it off the runway because the fuel dumps are empty.
And our good friends, the Arabs, are only taking bullion.
If we don't raise $14 billion, and that's million with a "B," this war is over by the end of the month.
We make a deal with the Japanese, we give whatever they want and we come home, because you've seen them fight, and they sure as shit ain't giving up.
$14 billion.
The last three drives didn't make that much all together.
People on the street corners, they looked at this picture and they took hope.
Don't ask me why, I think it's a crappy picture myself.
You can't even see your faces.
But it said we can win this war, are winning this war, we just need you to dig a little deeper.
They want to give us that money.
No, they want to give it to you.
But you, you don't want to ask for it.
You don't want to give them hope.
You want to explain about this person and that flag.
Well, that's your choice.
Because if we admit we made a mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about and that will be that.
Gentlemen.
Mr. President, here they are.
- Well, hello.
Good to see you.
- Mr. President.
Darn good to see you, boys.
Heard you had a hell of a fight on your hands out there, hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation in Arizona, am I right?
Yes, Mr. President.
Being an Indian, you are a truer American than any of us.
Bet your people are proud to see you wear that uniform.
Very proud, sir.
They should be.
Well, I want to thank you for coming all this way to Washington to help us out.
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific now we need you to fight for a mountain of cash.
- And I don't expect you'll let us down.
- No, sir.
Good.
Go get it.
That's the end of this ceremony.
Let's take a look at this famous photo over here, see if I can pick you out.
My gosh.
There you are.
Boys.
Boys, this one's on me.
To those who can't be with us.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon.
May we have your autograph?
I suppose.
And your name is?
I don't know about you, but I get the impression
I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.
You're such a hero.
I feel honored to be in your presence.
That's just not true.
That's professional work.
Here, to professionals.
Here they are.
You're the guys in the photograph, right?
I heard you were on the train.
Let me shake your hands, John Tennack.
John Bradley.
These boys are with me, Harvard and Yale types, didn't fight a lick.
Pappies all rich sons-of-bitches.
Boys, shake hands with some real war heroes.
Excuse me for one moment.
You can buy them a drink while you're at it.
That's right.
Drinks for these men all the way around.
And you're the other one, aren't you?
John Tennack, Tennack Homes.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Pleased to meet you.
Have a drink, come on.
And here's my card.
Listen to me, Rene, when you get finished being famous you come see me because if you can sell bonds, you can sell homes.
Now, they're not gonna build homes anymore, they're gonna deliver them.
- You heard of prefab homes?
- No, sir.
Well, you will.
And you hang on to that card and you come see me, you hear?
- All right?
- Certainly will.
All right.
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?
If Mike and the guys could see us.
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it, would they?
Harlon!
Franklin!
Can you imagine Franklin on this train
eating at the dining car with all the silver?
We shouldn't be here, Doc.
There's gonna be a Hallelujah Day
When the boys have all come home to stay
And a million bands begin to play
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
And when we've lit the torch of liberty
In each blacked-out land across the sea
Ira!
Hey, Ira!
We heard the picture was posed!
What?
We heard you posed the picture!
Hey, Doc!
We're bigger than life, Doc!
And we'll heave a mighty sigh
When each gal can kiss the boy she kissed goodbye
And they'll come marching down Fifth Avenue
The United Nations in review
When this lovely dream has all come true
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
Good job.
Thank you.
Thank you, girls!
And now, here are the men you've been waiting to meet, the men in white.
Right behind me here, the heroes of Iwo Jima,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon,
Private First Class Ira Hayes, and Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley!
Thank you.
It's good of you people to come out tonight in support of the war effort.
We really need you to buy bonds, that's for sure.
'Cause we can't win the war without your help.
As far as us being the heroes of Iwo Jima, that's just not the case.
We really didn't do much at all.
Especially him.
Especially me.
I was just a runner.
That's it.
We put up a flag.
The pole we attached it to was heavy, so it took a number of us.
We had our picture taken doing it.
The real heroes are dead on that island.
And we'd appreciate it if you bought bonds in honor of them.
Thank you.
Jump on any grenades, Ira?
Take out any machine gun nests I missed?
At least I fired my weapon.
All right, knock it off.
You hit anything or were you too drunk then, too?
What?
Guys!
Come on!
Stop it.
Knock it off.
The tall man with the high hat will be coming down your way
Get your savings out when you hear him shout
"Any bonds today?"
Any bonds today?
Bonds of freedom that's what I'm selling
Any bonds today?
Rene, right here.
Sit between these two boys.
Here comes the freedom man
Asking you to buy a share of freedom today ...for us and they need our help.
And, if you think about it, I think you'll realize that buying more bonds is not just the right thing to do but the only thing to do.
Yes, this war has gone on too long.
We have given too many lives.
And its cost...
- Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
- Strawberry.
...has been far too high.
But if we waver now, if we don't dig deep and give more than we think we can then those sacrifices would be wasted...
Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
...and those lives lost in vain.
Let's move!
Go, go!
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over.
Where the hell are our tanks?
Stuck in the sand.
Captain says you're to go without them.
Christ.
That's real good work you're doing there, Rene.
All right, prepare to move out.
Pass the word.
Second Platoon!
Move!
Move!
Move!
All right, Second Platoon, on your feet!
Let's move out!
Jackass.
Let's move out!
Go, go!
Move, move, move!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Second Platoon, move out!
Doc!
Doc, get out of there!
Corpsman!
Doc!
Doc, get the hell out of there!
May I have your attention, please.
Train number 48 with service from New York City, Boston,
Rochester, New York,
Toledo, Ohio, and South Bend, Indiana is now arriving on Track 7.
Train number 48 now arriving on Track number 7.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.
- Come on, boys.
- Let's go.
- Watch your step, ma'am.
- Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the heroes of Iwo Jima.
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.
Private First Class Ira Hayes.
And Private First Class Rene Gagnon.
Rene!
That's my boyfriend!
Who the hell is that?
I don't know.
- Rene, is that your girl?
- Hey, what do they call you?
How about a photo?
Hey, look at that!
What's your name, doll?
What's your name?
Hey, she's a beauty.
Let's go find a saloon.
Smile, boys.
Give them their money's worth.
Hey, Doc, how's the tour going for you?
Thank you.
Where exactly are you staying?
- I'm not sure yet.
- Just forget about that.
Senator, I'd like you to meet Corpsman John Bradley.
- Doc, right?
- Yes, sir.
Nice to meet you, Senator.
Good to meet you, young man.
Now, we appreciate everything you've done and everything you're doing.
- Thank you, sir.
- Quite all right.
This is Captain White.
- Colonel Johns.
- We're proud of you, Corpsman.
And then Colonel McCourtney.
- Major General Green.
- Nice to meet you.
Senator, this is Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Of course!
Now I hear you used a tomahawk on those Japs.
Is that true, Chief?
No, sir.
Well, tell them you did, makes a better story, huh?
- Attaboy.
- This is Captain Green.
John?
Madeline Evelley.
I recognize you from all the photographs.
I'm Hank's mom.
It's so nice to meet you, ma'am.
Hank was always talking about you.
This is PFC Rene Gagnon.
Pleasure to meet you, son.
Thanks for everything.
- My pleasure.
- Not at all.
Ira, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Strank, Mike's mom.
It's all right.
When I got the telegram, I...
I don't know what I'm trying to say here.
Knowing he was with you that day and seeing him in that photograph,
I don't know why it makes me feel better, but it does.
- It's so silly, isn't it?
- No, it's not.
How are you, son?
Thank you very much.
We're the largest furniture wholesaler in Illinois.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
- I'll make sure he calls.
- Well, thank you.
Thank you.
Are you Rene?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Franklin's mother.
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.
I'm Pauline, Rene's girlfriend.
Would you mind?
Paper said that's Hank, and I honestly can't tell.
It's horrible of a mother not to know her own son, isn't it?
But that's him, isn't it?
Well, to be honest, ma'am, it happened so quick, and with everything that was going on it's kind of hard to remember who was where.
But...
Yeah, I think...
I think that's where he was.
That's Hank.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Excuse us.
Take him outside.
I'm Pauline.
- Very nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
He was the best Marine I ever knew.
Thank you.
- You okay, Chief?
- Oh, Christ!
I'm okay.
Yeah, you look it.
You're gonna screw this up, aren't you?
You're gonna screw it up for all of us.
I've got him.
Get some sleep, Ira.
- Mike?
- Yeah?
- You see this?
- What?
- Mike!
- Oh, shit, go!
He's killing me!
Hey, Doc, you think they got them all?
What?
Well, they're not shooting at us.
Maybe we killed them all.
Or they ran off in the night or something.
Or they're waiting for us to start climbing.
Third Platoon!
Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.
- Just us?
- Yeah, just us, Igg.
All right, Third Platoon, move!
I tag along?
Yeah, you can lead the way if you want.
Get a good shot of my face.
It's your ass I'm gonna make famous, Hank.
Hey, that'll work for me, too.
Lieutenant, if you make it to the top, put this up.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, Iggy.
They never shoot at the first patrol.
- They don't?
- No.
They want us to go up to the top, signal to the others that it's okay, then shoot everybody else as they come up the mountain.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Unless of course they want to make an example of us and discourage all the others.
I think you're full of crap, you know that, Hank?
Really?
Jesus.
Thank God that ain't us.
Told you.
Boots, spread them out and put them on a line.
Set up a perimeter!
First Squad!
- Hank?
Find me a pole.
- Yeah.
Let's put this flag up.
Watch it.
Right over here.
Right here.
That's good.
That's good.
Right here, right here.
Got that end?
Hold that steady.
Lindberg.
- Hey, who's got rope?
- Right here.
Give me something.
Yeah, good.
That work?
Do it, fellas.
Keep it coming.
USMC!
USMC!
Shit, look at that!
Jeez, look at that.
Get down!
Take cover!
Cover with that.30!
- Watch it!
Twenty yards down, Hank!
- You see them?
- I got about 20 yards, left side.
- Lindberg, get the flamethrower!
- Boots, you see them?
- Cover right!
- About 20 yards down!
Duck one!
- You see them?
Keep the cover on!
Second Squad, you see them?
Get me some grenades!
I see them!
You see them?
Right flank, over to the right!
Cover me, I'm going down!
Careful, Iggy.
Easy.
All clear!
Okay, guys, who wants to be famous?
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
- God damn it.
Strank!
- Sir?
They want a phone line run up to the top of the mountain.
Let me guess, they picked us.
Second Platoon, let's go.
Get some exercise.
Let's go!
Get off your ass.
Oh, shit!
Hope it still works, 'cause you're not getting mine!
- Get Forrestal!
- All right, then.
I don't know whose idea it was, Mr. Secretary.
Well, it was goddamn brilliant.
I want that flag, Holland.
Mark my words, raising that son-of-a-bitch means a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.
I want that flag.
Yes, sir.
I'll make sure no one touches it.
You can count on me.
Fuck that.
That flag belongs to the men in this battalion.
That son-of-a-bitch thinks that our men died taking this ground so we could hand over our flag to some politician to pin to his wall?
He's out of his goddamn mind!
Get me that flag, and find another one to replace it.
You've gotta be shitting me.
Gagnon!
Get your ass over here.
Hey.
Hi, fellas.
How's it going?
Missed a beautiful shot, Joe.
It's that kind of day.
- Hey, Mike.
- Hell of a view, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant!
Captain says he wants that flag.
He wants this flag?
Yes, sir.
- We just put the damn thing up.
- Yes, sir.
Some kind of flag shortage?
He wants you to put this one up instead.
Hey, Mike.
Do me a favor and put this up, will you?
Yes, sir.
All right, let's find a pole.
Take the flag down, boys.
Captain's orders.
You heard him, let's do it.
There you go.
Lordy, she's a heavy one.
All right, hang on.
Put this on.
One hell of a view, huh?
Good view from up here.
Yes, I'd say so myself.
All right.
- Not in your way here, am I, Joe?
- Nah, I'm fine, thanks.
Hey, Doc, you wanna give us a hand here?
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.
Ready?
Ready?
Let's go.
You get it?
I don't know.
I wish I could've seen their faces.
Nobody even noticed that second flag going up.
Everybody saw that damn picture and made up their own story about it.
But your dad and the others knew what they had done and what they had not done.
All your friends dying, it's hard not to be called a hero for saving somebody's life.
But for putting up a pole?
You gotta be kidding.
Hey!
It took a lot of talented folks a long time to make that thing.
Just wait till tonight when it's lit properly and there's thousands of cheering people in the stands.
It's gonna look a lot better.
So, stadium lights come down, spotlight comes up and you get your cue.
You charge up this thing with the flag, you plant it at the top.
You smile, you wave.
You know the drill.
You want us to plant the flag on a pile of papier-m�ch�.
Hey, that's show biz.
And try and stand how you stood the first time you planted it.
Just, you know, pretend the other three guys are with you.
The dead guys.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, not a problem.
Good.
But where do we imagine Hank is standing?
Sorry?
Well, seeing that he wasn't there, it'll be kind of hard for us to leave a space for him.
I think you know exactly where he was.
You pointed him out to his mother.
This is bullshit.
I planted that damn thing once, and I'm not doing it again.
- Hayes!
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
Hayes.
Hayes, get your ass back here or you're going on report.
Hayes!
You wanna do your damn job?
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Come on!
He's with me!
Hey, he's with me!
- Back off!
- Sir, he's with me.
Okay?
He's with me.
Ira, put the goddamn chair down!
- Put the chair down, son!
- Put the chair down, Ira!
Tell them drop their sticks!
Ira, they're cops, they're supposed to have nightsticks.
You're not supposed to be in the street swinging a chair.
- Calm down, son.
- Sir, turn around, please.
That poster right there?
The one on the end, that's him.
- That's him?
- Yes, sir.
You read the papers?
Christ.
We got another fucking hero.
Get him out of here.
- Can you do that?
- Yes, sir.
Put the goddamn chair down.
And let's go.
Did you start this?
He didn't serve me!
I don't make the rules.
We don't serve Indians.
He needs to go sleep it off.
Soldier Field.
You hear that?
What the hell is that?
I can't figure it out.
Keep an eye out.
It sounds like it's coming from up there.
They're using grenades.
They're killing themselves.
Ira, let's go.
Come on.
Let's go, Ira.
Come on.
Thank God.
Jesus.
Look at you, Chief.
You found him.
Holy shit.
You would have to pick today.
Vandegrift is here with enough brass to start a fucking band.
Come on, let's go.
Can you walk?
- Yes, sir.
- By yourself?
All right, look.
I don't care if you have to carry him get him to the top, plant that flag, and don't fucking fall off.
Get him in his stuff.
I'll stall these guys for as long as I can.
Hurry up.
Jesus Christ.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Cover!
Harlon!
Harlon!
Get your fire team up in that position!
O'Hare!
First Fire Team!
Work around!
BAR, you, on the side of the ridge!
Covering fire, boys, go, go, go!
Jackson, work your team around to the left!
Cover!
Left flank!
Left flank!
Franklin, Gust, go check it out!
Hustle up, boys!
We got them!
Clear!
One hell of an experience.
Move out!
Cease fire!
They're my men!
You're targeting our men!
You're targeting our...
Get me another radio!
Sergeant?
Sergeant!
Mike!
Mike, Mike, Mike.
Mike?
Mike.
Hey, where's Doc?
Corpsman!
Oh, shit.
How's his breathing?
Harlon, move, buddy.
Hey, Mike.
Mike, Mike, can you hear us?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on, Mike.
Mike?
Mike, can you hear us?
All right, let's go!
Move out!
I'm gonna get a stretcher.
Let's take him down, move him off the beach.
Ladies and gentlemen, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Corpsman!
Hank!
Hank!
Doc, they killed me.
Harlon!
Doc, they killed me.
Come on, Harlon.
Harlon, stay with me.
Franklin!
I'm fine, Ira.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Does it open?
Iggy!
Iggy!
Iggy, are you down there?
Iggy!
Can't tell who it is, but he's one of ours.
I had to go outside to throw up.
Look what they did to the poor son-of-a-bitch.
You okay, Chief?
Just let it go.
If that doesn't pry open their wallets, nothing will.
Jesus Christ, he's drunk.
Goddamn Indians.
Come on, Chief.
Let's get you home.
That's not what I hear.
I called around, I'm not stupid.
He's been drunk since he started this damn tour, making a spectacle of himself.
Just about choked that poor woman at the reception, blubbering.
Jesus Christ, you're supposed to be watching these men.
Yes, sir.
Well, he's making us look like regular asses.
Well, with all due respect, sir, he never wanted to come on this trip in the first place.
We had to pull him, kicking and screaming, off that boat.
He wants to be with his unit.
What unit?
They're all fucking dead.
This is how he honors those men?
By drinking and throwing up, and...
You know what?
He wants it, great, we'll send him back.
Get him packed and on a train today.
He's an embarrassment to the uniform.
Yes, sir.
I'll do it.
Yeah, no, that's...
That's good.
That's what I want.
I know it's a good thing, raising the money and that, 'cause we need it.
But,
I can't take them calling me a hero.
All I did was try not to get shot.
Some of the things I saw done, things I did,
they weren't things to be proud of, you know?
Mike...
Mike was a hero.
You ever meet him?
No.
Best Marine I ever met.
You know, Chief, I think if Mike was sitting here instead of you he'd be saying the same thing about himself,
not being a hero.
Maybe.
He was a good guy.
But I think that he would be ashamed of me, seeing me the way I am.
Think I could see my ma before they ship me off?
Think they'd do that?
See my ma?
I'm sorry, Ira.
We got stories now to tell our kids, I guess.
Keep your head down.
All aboard.
Good luck, Chief.
I think I saw him once after that.
It was maybe six or seven years after the war.
I was working as a salesman, doing a lot of driving.
I was driving west across Texas.
I was just trying to get where I was going so I could get home.
And I saw this guy hitchhiking on the side of the road.
And, for a second, I thought it might've been him.
I always regret that I didn't stop, but I was in a hurry.
And he was an Indian.
We always told the press that Ira insisted that he was going back to fight with his unit which was at least partially true, but
that isn't what got the headlines.
We're engaged.
Excuse me a minute, darling.
- Hey, Doc?
- Yeah?
- Got a minute?
- Yeah.
I'll see you at the car.
- You hear I'm getting married?
- I did, Rene.
That's great.
Yeah, it's something she wants.
She waited for me all this time.
She's not used to all this, but she's a good girl.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
So, I was wondering if you'd be my best man.
Me?
Don't you have somebody at home, a buddy, you'd rather ask?
Well, I didn't really make many.
The ones who didn't go, it's...
Well, it's hard to even talk to them.
You know?
Yeah, I know.
I'd be proud to.
Thank you.
I better go drag her away from them before she announces
I'm gonna be president of General Motors or something.
All right.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Rene, you're a lucky man.
- Big smile, Mrs. Gagnon!
- Say cheese!
I couldn't complain because the press loved them, so they wrote more articles and people bought more bonds.
The tour went on with just Rene and your dad.
And the true heroes are the men who didn't make it home from Iwo Jima, the men who died at Iwo Jima and in other campaigns.
We ask that you honor the memory of those men by buying the war bonds and helping us to win this war.
Thank you.
City after city, I thought the damn thing'd never end.
And this rumor kept going around that the photograph had been staged.
I remember your dad telling them that he wished he'd known he was having his picture taken because he would've ducked the hell out of it.
Whose idea was it?
Who wanted to stage the thing?
Come on, it was you?
Was there truth to the rumor that that picture was staged, Doc?
- Come on!
Doc?
- Can you answer that?
I remember when your dad got shot.
All hell was busting loose.
People back home saw that picture and thought it was over when we took Suribachi.
We wished.
Anyways, we're pinned down.
Mortars, shells, machine guns.
Fire coming from every which direction, right?
And we hear somebody call, "Corpsman down. "
Corpsman down!
Blood was spurting out of his throat, and Doc was doing everything he could.
And the Corpsman looks up at him and he knows what this means, to be shot in the neck.
He knows he's dying, you can see that.
But still in his eyes, he's pleading with Doc to save his life.
And Doc can't.
- You okay, Doc?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah, you look fine.
- I'm okay.
Keep down, all right?
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.
Okay.
Corpsman.
Corpsman!
For God sake, Corpsman!
Corpsman?
Corpsman.
Incoming!
Let me see.
It's not that bad.
You're gonna be okay.
All right?
Just stay with me.
Look at me.
Took us a half-hour to find your dad.
He could've bled to death.
Coming down.
Thanks.
Vets'll tell you about being hit but not wanting to leave their buddies.
Usually, they're lying.
You'll take any excuse to get out of there.
But it happens.
You get the feeling you're letting them down.
I could see that in your dad's face.
He wanted to go, he'd seen enough.
But he didn't want to leave us.
Now, he was a hell of a good man, your dad.
Yeah.
While we were sitting there on the beach, we heard this great roar.
And we looked up.
That was the first of thousands of landings on Iwo.
- Look at that.
- Yeah.
How about that.
I'm gonna head back, all right?
Good luck.
That island saved a lot of lives.
A lot of lives.
I don't know what else to tell you.
After the bond tour my dad finally got his operation.
By the time he got home the war was over.
First thing he did was ask my mom to marry him.
Ira tried to get on with his life and put it all behind him.
Thank you for having me here today.
It's an honor to be in front of such a strong people.
Because of the war white men will understand Indians a lot better.
And it's going to be a better world.
But life had other plans for him.
You're...
You're him, aren't you?
You're the hero, right?
Great.
All right, kids, go get your picture taken.
Oh, that's great.
That's great.
All right, now say cheese.
Cheese!
That's great!
Okay.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Thanks.
- Come on.
- That's a hero, kids.
Hero, lift this basket, will you?
It's too heavy for me.
Rene tried to take advantage of those offers he'd received on the bond tour.
Yes.
G-A-G-N-O-N.
Right.
Pronounced Rene.
Rene, yes.
- Okay, I actually called last week.
- Yes.
Okay, yes.
Mr. Gagnon.
I gave Mr. Tennack your message.
I'm sure he'll call you.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
But he was yesterday's hero.
He even applied for a job at the local police station.
They said he wasn't qualified.
After working the factory with Pauline he tried a few things but spent the rest of his life as a janitor.
But Ira...
Ira!
You got a visitor.
Ira always made the news.
I could never find out why he did it, but one day Ira just took off.
He walked and hitched over 1,300 miles from Arizona to Texas.
He found Harlon Block's father working his field.
His wife, Belle, had left him soon after they discovered Harlon died.
She never forgave him for letting her son go off to war.
And Ira told him the truth, that it had been his son who raised the flag with them, his son in the photograph.
And then he just turned and walked away.
Though the flag-raising meant nothing to him, he somehow knew it would mean everything to them.
Thanks for calling.
Just as Belle knew all along.
The press soon found out and called Hank's mom with the news that it wasn't her son after all.
The last time they all saw each other was at the unveiling of the Marine Corps War Memorial.
And even though he planted the first flag above Iwo Jima,
Hank's mother and father weren't invited.
Ira.
It's good to see you, Ira.
Hell of a statue.
It wasn't long after that that they found Ira.
The papers said he died of exposure.
There was no autopsy.
It was about that same time when my father got in his car early one morning telling my mom he had something to do.
He drove to a town on the other side of Wisconsin where Iggy's mom lived.
Ever since she heard the news about her son she'd been trying to find out how he died, and no one would tell her.
I never found out what he told her, but I can pretty much guarantee it wasn't the truth.
My mother would ask him what was troubling him.
He would never say.
And every year, as it got close to Memorial Day, the reporters would start calling asking to interview my father.
No, I'm sorry.
He's fishing in Canada.
We were always instructed to say the same thing.
Okay.
Thanks.
When Mr. McCandless retired, my father bought the funeral home where he'd worked since coming home.
He spent the rest of his life running the business and raising his family.
He never spoke about the war or about the flag-raising, never told us anything.
The first time I heard any of these stories was after he died.
Where is he?
Oh, God.
He's not here, Dad.
He died.
Who?
Who died?
Iggy.
Iggy.
Christ, poor Iggy.
I hadn't thought of him for years.
How do you know about Iggy?
You were calling for him, when you collapsed.
I wasn't looking for Iggy.
I was looking for you.
I wanted to...
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry I wasn't a better father.
Talked to you more.
I just...
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
You were the best father a man could have.
Did I ever tell you they took us swimming?
No, Dad.
After we planted the flag, we came down off the mountain and they let us swim.
It was the funniest thing.
All this fighting and we were jumping around in the water like kids.
That's the way I remember Iggy now.
I finally came to the conclusion that maybe he was right.
Maybe there's no such thing as heroes.
Maybe there are just people like my dad.
I finally came to understand why they were so uncomfortable being called heroes.
Heroes are something we create, something we need.
It's a way for us to understand what is almost incomprehensible, how people could sacrifice so much for us.
But for my dad and these men, the risks they took, the wounds they suffered, they did that for their buddies.
They may have fought for their country, but they died for their friends.
For the man in front, for the man beside them.
And if we wish to truly honor these men, we should remember them the way they really were, the way my dad remembered them.
Come on, Doc!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
For God's sakes!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
What's wrong?
Every jackass thinks he knows what war is.
Especially those who have never been in one.
We like things nice and simple:
Good and evil, heroes and villains.
There's always plenty of both.
Most of the time, they are not who we think they are.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where, where is he?
Mr. Bradley?
Mr. B?
You okay?
- Where is he?
- Where is who?
Where is he?
Where did he go?
Where, where is he?
All right.
Just stay right here, okay?
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
It'll be okay.
Where is he?
Most guys I knew would never talk about what happened over there.
Probably because they're still trying to forget about it.
They certainly didn 't think of themselves as heroes.
They died without glory.
Nobody has taken their pictures.
Only their buddies knew what they did.
I'd tell their folks they died for their country.
I'm not sure that was it.
Now, there were plenty other photos taken that day but none anybody wanted to see.
What we see and do in war the cruelty, is unbelievable.
But somehow we gotta make some sense of it.
To do that, we need an easy-to-understand truth and damn few words.
Film's ruined.
I don't know.
This one looks all right.
And if you can get a picture...
Now, the right picture can win or lose a war.
You're gonna want to see this.
Look at Vietnam.
The picture of that South Vietnamese officer blowing that fella's brains out of the side of his head.
That was it.
The war was lost.
We just hung around trying to pretend it wasn't.
Took a lot of other pictures that day.
None of them made a difference.
Thanks.
Appreciate it.
Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.
Country was bankrupt.
People were becoming cynical and tired of war.
- Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon!
- Where?
Right there.
Planting that flag, that's your brother.
Ma, all you can see is his behind.
And that's his.
I powdered and diapered it, I know my son.
That's him.
Go get your father.
Daddy, Ma's got a picture of Harlon's keister in the paper.
You watch your mouth, young man.
Thank you.
One photo, almost all on its own, turned that around.
It's on the front page of every major paper.
Over 200 dailies and they're all flooded with requests for prints.
I think we might have found it.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- I gotta go get him.
- Oh, no, you don't.
Iggy, I gotta go.
I have a whole different theory.
He wants medical attention, he'll come to us.
Hey, shut up and crawl over here, you lazy son of a bitch!
- As soon as that flare goes out.
- Crap.
- Okay, well, I'll go with you.
- No.
- You're gonna leave me here?
- I'll be right back, just...
Shoot some people.
I gotta go.
Oh, God.
Okay, it's okay.
Don't touch them.
Get your hands out, let me do that.
Don't look.
Keep your head back, your eyes on me.
Look at me.
I'll get it.
I'll take care of it.
We'll get this bandage on you.
We'll get you taken care of.
And we'll get you down to the bottom, all right?
You're gonna be fine.
It's okay.
I'll do that.
I'll do that.
Put some pressure on that.
Put your hands on top and put pressure on it.
Keep your head back.
Keep breathing.
Keep looking at me, all right?
Just keep looking at...
Doc.
Help me.
Help me.
How does that feel?
- It feels good.
- It does?
All right.
- Good.
- All right.
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.
I'll be right back.
I'm all right.
Go and help someone who's hurt.
All right.
Hold on there.
- Where did he go?
- Who?
- The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
- You jumped in the wrong hole.
I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Lggy!
Lggy!
Shut up.
You want every Jap shooting at us?
Lggy!
Holy shit.
They expect us to climb this?
Or something just like it.
So where you think they're sending us?
I think it's the desert, Franklin.
Well, that makes no sense at all.
Well, it's just military psychology.
They always train you for the desert on a volcano.
Now you're just having fun with me.
Harlon, take your men right.
Watch for Bedouins.
- What's a Bedouin?
- It's a guy with a camel.
Well, jeez Louise, maybe we are going to the desert.
Now, you tilt that to the right, but what if the bullet comes from the left?
Bullets don't come from the left.
You know any left-handed Japs?
That makes as much sense as you showering with your shoes on.
You don't even know why you do it, do you?
Because I don't tell you mean I don't know?
You do it because Mike does it.
I'll ask him.
- So you cut hair back home?
- Some.
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?
No, I just studied it a little.
- But not in barber school?
- Nope.
Let me guess, Hayes is winning.
Chief, I had very little to do with Sitting Bull's death so maybe you could stop taking it out on me.
Different tribe.
The Pimas fought on the side of the white man.
- See, now that's smart.
- That is smart.
Yeah.
Worked real good for us.
Good luck, fellas.
Hey, good night, Lindberg.
Dead bodies.
He cuts hair on dead bodies.
Even I knew that.
- Who's in?
- Oh, I'm in.
It must be a lot easier with them not moving around and all.
There's that.
You know what I been thinking?
Well, they been telling us we need to buddy up and I think we'd make pretty good buddies.
And how do you figure that?
Well, you know, in that we have a lot in common.
So why do you cut dead people's hair, anyway?
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.
You tell a lot of people that?
You actually chose the Marines because they got the best uniform?
No sense being a hero if you don't look like one.
Jacks.
Queens.
Shit.
Do anything on that reservation but play cards, chief?
All right, listen up, you sorry bunch of leathernecks!
We going over the side tomorrow which means we ain't long for this rock.
- All right!
- About time.
Any man who doesn't have his masturbation papers in order get them signed by tomorrow or he ain't going.
- I got mine already.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm square.
Wait.
Why am I just hearing about this?
I don't have to repeat everything twice for you.
No, I didn't hear nothing about no masturbating papers.
Heard they were running short.
You know, nobody tells me nothing.
That's real nice, guys.
All right, get over to the officer in charge of records.
Maybe he's got more.
- Leave your smokes.
I'll play for you.
- Thanks, Mike.
Listen, he calls you an idiot, you take it like a man, okay?
Just do not leave without signing them.
- I appreciate it, sergeant.
- You got it.
What the hell happened to your hair, Rene?
Look like a goddamn corpse.
Three points of contact on that rope at all times.
Next four.
Over the side.
Let's go.
Keep moving.
Next four, over the side.
Keep your eye on the guy below you.
That's all you gotta look at.
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.
Keep three points of contact on the rope at all times.
You see?
No big thing.
Just one step at a time and keep your hands on the vertical rope.
Once you're in the boat, move away.
Make sure you keep three points of contact on the rope.
- I got him!
- All right, get that man out of the water.
Give me a hand.
- Don't worry about him, Doc.
- All right, quit skylarking!
Keep moving.
He'll be fine.
Our target, Island X is an ugly, smelly, dirty little scab of rock called lwo Jima.
It means Sulfur Island, which accounts for the smell.
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop, you ask me.
After 20 straight days of bombing you won't find a blade of grass or a twig on it.
It wasn't that pretty to start with.
Captain?
Lwo's just five and a half miles long, two and a half wide.
There's a lump down at the bottom.
That's Mount Suribachi.
On the maps in front of you the island is white.
Not much of it.
The black dots represent known enemy emplacements.
Coastal defense guns, dual-mount dual- purpose guns, covered artillery.
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes, and earth-covered structures.
I don't see any barracks or any other structures.
That's right.
And we still don't know why.
Now, this isn't just any island to them.
This isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, or Saipan.
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders in eight square miles.
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.
It's up to us to convince them.
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.
The 8th Ammo Company will land here to resupply.
The Suribachi's guns are the problem.
They can hit any point on the island.
We're sitting ducks until we take them out.
That's our job.
We cut across the island at the base, slit its throat, lop off its head.
And we take that mountain.
We take that mountain, we take their big guns.
We take their eyes.
Okay, I'm heading in.
Follow me.
Let's put a good show on for the Marines.
Close it up.
Take it right down to the deck.
Yeah, boys!
Man overboard portside!
See him?
- Throw me a line!
- He's right there.
- Where is he?
- Watch out, watch out, watch out.
Hawaii's that way!
Just keep paddling, Mac, we'll catch you on the way back!
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!
They're not gonna stop.
What?
None of them are.
They can't.
So much for "no man left behind."
- Sir.
- Come on in.
Look, I've had to make a few other changes.
I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
- You bet.
Trouble is, I already told my men I'd see them through this.
That your James Cagney impersonation?
Because I've heard better.
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.
This isn't your first time.
You don't need to prove anything.
No, sir.
You're not the best sergeant, you're just the best one that's still walking.
- Block's a good man.
- Yes, sir, he is.
The men know him, he can step right in.
You know, I have actually thought this through.
Platoon sergeant puts you further away from the bullets.
I already gave them my word, sir.
I told them I'd bring them all home.
Which means I already lied to half of them.
Can't lie to the rest.
How are your men?
They'll do fine.
Except maybe Gagnon.
Our own Tyrone Power?
Yes, sir.
He's a good man, just might be better use further back from the lines.
I'll use him as a runner.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
Now get out of here.
Hear the good news, Doc?
We're going in with the first waves.
Hey, you do that again I'll take your head off!
Fucking dominoes.
Iggy, have you ever heard news you considered to be bad?
The first ones off the ship, Doc.
We don't go over the side of the ship.
We hop on a tractor, they drive us right there.
Oh, shit, that is good news.
You see?
What did I tell you?
What's going on?
- I'm going up to take a look.
- Let's go.
Let's go topside.
Come on!
- I'll go with you.
- Come on, come on!
What the hell?
- Let's go, let's go!
- Right behind you.
Look at that.
We're killing them!
We're killing them, Doc.
I was promised 10 days of shelling.
You're giving me three and saying that's the best you can do?
I don't give a shit!
My men hit that beach with less than 10 and I'll be taking them home to their mamas in buckets!
Yeah, I know exactly why.
Because every Navy man with a scrambled egg on his chest wants to offload us here and sail to Japan so they can be there for the big finish.
Tell their kids they captured the emperor all by themselves.
Well, you aren't going to Japan unless we take this piece-of-shit island!
These little pricks are dug in!
Okay.
Appreciate that, Jim.
Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
I'm okay.
- Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
- Jesus, Iggy, leave me alone, all right?
How about you guys?
Knife?
Bayonet?
Kick in the ass?
How about you, Doc?
Sharpen your knife?
You sharpened it three times already.
Then I better make sure I didn't nick it.
Good man, Doc.
- Hey, Doc.
- Yeah.
When we land, try not to wave this kit around too much.
They got sharpshooters trained to look for them.
They know if they take out a corpsman another dozen Marines will die unattended.
Okay, Mike.
Yeah, right there.
- Close the damn door.
For God's sake.
- Yeah, like that's gonna help.
That your girlfriend, chief?
Bet she's a pretty damn good-looking squaw.
Bet you're missing her, and that little wigwam of yours.
Welcome, all Marines off Iwo Jima.
We have a long-time wait...
It's what they do to prisoners at least the lucky ones.
Jesus.
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think about waving a white bandanna.
Poor Marines, so far from home for no good reason.
Think of your girls back home, waiting for you.
But a girl cannot stay home every night so who do you think they're with tonight?
And will she let him kiss her?
And will he comfort her at your funeral?
This sweet music is to make you think of your girls back home who are missing you.
This is all for now.
I'll see you tomorrow night.
We're clear!
Get up the berm!
Baker Company, move out!
- Seen Second Platoon?
- I don't see them.
- First squad, move out!
- God, this place reeks.
- Go, go, go!
- Move out!
Go, go, go!
Go, go!
Go!
Go, go!
Drop your packs!
Go!
All clear!
Jesus, you needed some exercise?
He got lost. 100 landing craft heading for one beach and this guy gets lost.
I'm glad we did.
Jesus, what a mess.
Any theories why they ain't shooting?
It's getting on my nerves.
Maybe they're all dead.
What do you think, Doc?
- You think they're all dead?
- Keep moving, Easy Company!
Let's go!
Mike, take six men and bring that gun onto the beach.
Second Platoon, let's move out!
Stay down.
Come on.
Move!
Move!
- Get down!
- Take cover!
Move out!
Go, go!
Get up on the beach!
Get up on the berm!
Go, go, go!
Cover fire!
Pour it on!
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!
Corpsman!
I'm gonna sling your arm and then I'll give you a shot for the pain.
Move, move!
Off the beach!
Take cover!
Dig in!
Dig in!
First Platoon!
Move, move!
You got a girl back home, Marine?
We're gonna make sure she sees you, all right?
Hey, I need pressure on this wound!
- See anything?
- Negative!
Pull that fire team up!
Where's the fire coming from?
Where are they?
Look for a flash, shoot at it!
Let's go, let's...
- Move it out!
- Move, move!
Let's go!
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!
You're over!
Third Squad, forward!
Move!
Where are they, sir?
We got ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock, pillbox!
Sergeant!
Sergeant.
I think I can clear that out.
All right, you go.
Here.
Take these.
Check your weapon.
Yeah?
Go!
Cover!
Cover him!
Cover, cover!
Son of a bitch.
- Let's go!
Go!
- Move it out!
Go, go, go!
Down, down, down!
- It's clear.
- Good work.
- I thought you said it was clear!
- It was!
Shit, I guess they're not in there firing at us then.
Lindberg!
Yeah!
Light it up!
- I'll over you, Ice!
- Don't cover shit!
There's already enough people shooting.
One bullet and this thing goes up like a Roman candle.
Go!
Shift fire!
- Shift your fire!
- Go, go!
Shift your fire!
Go!
Go!
Hit the deck!
Stay down!
Wait for support!
Is this a bad battle or what?
- It's a fucking slaughter.
- Get down!
Corpsman!
Christ Jesus!
Get a machine gun team set up over here now!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Thank God!
Tanks!
Runner!
Get those tanks up here!
- Oh, shit.
- Man.
Get down!
Corporal, watch your left flank!
- Let's go without them!
- Let's go!
- Move out!
Move out!
- Let's go!
Let's go, move it.
Let's go!
Lggy, you gotta lift your side, he's gonna roll off.
Got it, Doc!
Incoming!
Corpsman!
- Move, move, move!
- Everybody off the LVT, now!
Give them cover fire!
Corpsman!
Keep moving!
Get that LVT up on the beach!
Keep moving!
You're next, pal, we're getting you out of here.
Move it!
Great news.
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa, because that's where we're headed.
Not you and me.
Captain Severance asked who else was in that picture.
Christ if I could remember but it was Mike and Doc and Franklin and me and Hank Hansen but I just remembered, you were there too.
I wasn't there.
Of course you were.
Neither was Hank.
He raised the first flag.
Harlon Block raised that one.
Shit.
I told them it was Hank.
If you weren't there, how'd you know it was Harlon?
- You tell them it was me?
- No.
I just remembered.
Good, keep your mouth shut.
They know there was somebody else, by the picture.
- Pick someone dead.
- They don't want somebody dead they want to ship us back to the States.
What did I tell you?
- I wasn't there.
You hear?
- All right.
Just settle down.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're not going anywhere.
You wounded, son?
No, sir.
Did you take out a nest of Japs butt-naked with your bare hands?
Because if I'm gonna give up my seat to a hero, he better have a good goddamn story to tell.
No, sir.
Then enjoy it, because they'll forget you before Christmas.
Sixth man, you got a name?
Sorry, still don't remember.
Damn shame, because I promised the major you'd know who it was.
Fact, you not knowing throws a doubt on you being one of the flag-raisers yourself.
Since no one wants to be embarrassed, the moment you land they'll turn around, ship you to Okinawa to meet your buddies on the beach.
So why don't you stop screwing with me?
Give me a damn name.
Gangway!
Gangway!
Let's go, let's go!
Gangway!
Where the hell is that son of a bitch?
Hayes!
Hayes!
Hayes, get your red ass over here!
Looks like I don't know what my men are doing with a flag the size of my mother's house?
Damn it, you shouldn't have lied to me.
Made me look like a complete asshole.
We're gonna miss you around here.
Good luck.
Now your name's in the paper too.
Just heard your doctor say we're postponing your operation.
You're being shipped back to the mainland.
Everybody who saw that picture thought planting the flag meant victory.
That's all they wanted to know.
Victory.
Within a few weeks of that picture being taken, half the men in it were dead.
Mrs. Hansen.
Mrs. Hansen.
Did you know Hank was a hero?
- Are you proud of him?
- What was he like as a boy?
- Look this way, please, ma'am.
- What do you have to say about your son?
But, somehow, being a part of it meant something.
Looking at it, you could believe their sacrifice was not a waste.
Yeah, I might have thought that was Harlon too.
It is.
Belle, their names are right here.
It's not him.
And he would be alive and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.
You think about that when you look at his picture, Ed.
And I need to rush home and change because there's the governor's banquet and then there's the parade.
Imagine, the governor is coming here to meet us.
Now, I'm wearing blue so...
We interrupt this program to bring you a news bulletin from CBS World News.
A press association has just announced that President Roosevelt is dead.
The president died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
All we know so far is that the president died at Warm Springs in Georgia.
Further updates every hour.
Temperatures will remain the same today in the mid-30s to low-40s with clear skies.
Hello?
Yes.
Of course.
No, we understand.
It wouldn't be right.
Thank you.
Here he is, gentlemen.
Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.
Senator Haddigan, I'd like you to meet Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Damn good to meet you.
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.
Sorry?
That's Pima Indian talk, don't you know your own language?
Took forever to memorize the damn gibberish.
Sorry, I've been away from the reservation too long, senator.
- Doc.
- Ira.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
- That's you.
- Go, go, go.
Please welcome...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Holy shit.
Come in, come in, come in.
Bud Gerber, Treasury Department.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Bud Gerber.
- Showing the boys the sights?
- Saw a hell of a ball game.
That's great.
The bar's there, help yourself.
I got some briefing sheets for you, some simple things we want you to say.
Mostly "Buy bonds." Can't say that too often.
Itineraries, those'll change every minute.
Everybody wants to meet you guys.
I got women sending up envelopes with stockings in them notes written in lipstick.
We won't mention that to the press.
Have a drink, for chrissake.
My God, what you boys must've seen over there.
I've been watching the newsreels.
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.
So we got a hell of a lot of money to raise, not much time.
White House tomorrow, then you shake hands with a few hundred congressmen who won't pull out a penny.
Politicians and actors.
Put them in a restaurant, they'd die before paying the check.
Then New York City, Times Square dinners with various hoi polloi, then Chicago.
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?
That's what we're calling the mothers of the dead flag-raisers.
You present each mother with a flag, they say a few words people will shit money.
It'll be so moving.
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.
Lovely woman.
She knows how close you and her son were.
He wrote home about you.
She is very much looking forward to meeting you.
Hank wasn't in the picture.
Sorry?
Hank didn't raise that flag.
He raised the other one, the real flag.
The what?
The real flag?
There's a real flag?
Ours was the replacement flag.
We put it up when they took the other one down.
Am I the only one getting a headache here?
You know about this?
It was after it was already in the papers.
The mothers had already been told, but...
That's beautiful.
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Why tell me?
I'm only the guy that has to explain it to 150 million Americans.
Who's in the goddamn picture?
Are any of you guys in the goddamn picture?
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.
Six guys raising a flag over lwo Jima.
Victory is ours.
- You're three of them?
- This was the fifth day.
The battle went on for 35 more.
What'd you do, raise a damn flag every time you stopped for lunch?
Can I hit this guy?
I don't give a shit, you raised the flag, that's the story we're selling, boys.
Are you deaf?
Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?
Harlon Block.
That's whose mother should be here if anyone's should be.
You know, I think this whole damn thing is a farce, if you ask me.
You know what they're calling this bond drive?
The Mighty Seventh.
They might've called it the "We're Flat Broke so We're Begging for Pennies" bond drive, but it didn't have the ring.
They could've called it that because the last bond drives came so short we printed money instead.
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street our dollar is next to worthless, we borrowed so much.
And nobody is lending any more.
Ships aren't being built.
Tanks aren't being built.
Machine guns, bazookas, hand grenades, zip.
You think this is a farce?
You want to go back to your buddies?
Stuff some rocks in your pockets because that's all we got to throw at the Japanese.
And don't be surprised if your plane doesn't make it because the fuel dumps are empty.
And our good friends the Arabs are only taking bullion.
If we don't raise 14 billion dollars...
And that's million with a "B."
- This war is over by the end of the month.
We give the Japanese whatever they want and we come home.
You've seen them fight, and they sure as shit ain't giving up.
Fourteen billion.
The last three drives didn't make that much altogether.
People on the street corners, they looked at this picture and they took hope.
Don't ask me why, I think it's crappy, myself.
You can't even see your faces.
But it said, "We can win this war, are winning this war we just need you to dig a little deeper."
They wanna give us that money.
No, they want to give it to you.
But you don't want to ask for it, give them hope.
You want to explain about this person and that flag.
Well, that's your choice.
Because if we admit we made a mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about and that will be that.
Gentlemen.
Mr. President, here they are.
- Well, hello.
Good to see you.
- Mr. President.
Darn good to see you, boys.
Heard you had a hell of a fight on your hands out there, hell of a fight.
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation in Arizona, am I right?
Yes, Mr. President.
Being an Indian, you are a truer American than any of us.
Bet your people are proud you're in that uniform.
Very proud, sir.
They should be.
Thank you for coming all this way to Washington to help us out.
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific now we need you to fight for a mountain of cash.
- I don't expect you'll let us down.
- No, sir.
- No, sir.
- Good.
Then go get it.
That's the end of this ceremony.
Let's take a look at this famous photo over here, see if I can pick you out.
My gosh.
There you are.
Boys.
Boys, this one's on me.
- To those who can't be with us.
- Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon.
May we have your autograph?
I suppose.
And your name is?
I get the impression I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.
You're such a hero.
I feel honored to be in your presence.
That's just not true.
That's professional work.
Here, to professionals.
Here they are.
You're the guys in the photograph, right?
I heard you were on the train.
Let me shake your hands.
John Tennack.
John Bradley.
These boys, Harvard and Yale types, didn't fight.
Pappies all rich sons of bitches.
Boys, shake hands with some real war heroes.
Excuse me for one moment.
Buy them a drink while you're at it.
Drinks for these men all the way around.
And you're the other one, John Tennack, Tennack Homes.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Pleased to meet you.
Have a drink.
And here's my card.
Listen to me, Rene.
When you get finished being famous, you come see me because if you can sell bonds, you can sell homes.
Now, they're not gonna build homes anymore, they're gonna deliver them.
- Heard of prefab homes?
- No, sir.
You will.
And you hang on to that card and you come see me, you hear?
- All right?
- Certainly will.
All right.
It's all right.
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?
If Mike and the guys could see us.
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it, would they?
Harlon!
Franklin!
Can you imagine Franklin on this train eating at the dining car with all the silver?
We shouldn't be here, Doc.
Ira!
Hey, Ira.
We heard the picture was posed.
- What?
- We heard you posed the picture!
Hey, Doc.
We're bigger than life, Doc.
- Hey, good job.
- Thank you.
Thank you, girls.
And now here are the men you've been waiting to meet the men in white.
Right behind me, here, the heroes of Iwo Jima:
Private First Class Rene Gagnon Private First Class Ira Hayes and Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley!
Thank you.
It's good of you to come out tonight in support of the war effort.
We really need you to buy bonds, that's for sure.
Because we can't win the war without your help.
As far as us being the heroes of Iwo Jima that's just not the case.
We really didn't do much at all.
Especially him.
Especially me.
I was just a runner.
That's it.
We put up a flag.
The pole we attached it to was heavy, so it took a number of us.
We had our picture taken doing it.
The real heroes are dead on that island.
We'd appreciate it if you bought bonds in honor of them.
Thank you.
Jump on any grenades, Ira?
Take out any machine gun nests I missed?
- At least I fired my weapon.
- All right, knock it off.
You hit anything or were you too drunk then too?
Hey, hey, hey.
Guys!
Come on.
Stop it.
Knock it off.
Sit between these two boys.
- For us and they need our help.
And if you think about it, I think you'll realize that buying more bonds is not just the right thing to do but the only thing to do.
Yes, this war has gone on too long.
We have given too many lives.
And its cost...
- Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
- Strawberry.
- Has been far too high.
But if we waver now if we don't dig deep and give more than we think we can then those sacrifices would be wasted...
- Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
...and those lives lost in vain.
Move!
Go, go!
Corpsman!
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over.
Where the hell are our tanks?
Stuck in the sand.
Captain says go without them.
Christ.
Real good work you're doing there, Rene.
Prepare to move out.
Pass the word.
- Prepare to move out!
- Second Platoon!
- Move!
Move!
- All right, Second Platoon, on your feet!
- Let's move out!
- Jackass.
- Let's move out!
- Go, go, go!
Move, go, go, move, move!
Corpsman!
Doc!
Doc, get out of there!
Corpsman!
Doc!
Doc, get the hell out of there!
May I have your attention, please?
Train number 48, with service from New York City Boston, Rochester, New York Toledo, Ohio, South Bend, Indiana is now arriving on Track 7.
Train number 48, now arriving on Track number 7.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.
- Come on, let's go.
- Boys.
- Watch your step, now.
- Thank you very much.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Watch your step.
- Let me help you, ma'am.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the heroes of Iwo Jima.
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.
- Private First Class Ira Hayes.
- Excuse me, let me through, please.
And Private First Class Rene Gagnon.
Rene!
That's my boyfriend!
- Who the hell is that?
- I don't know.
- Rene, is that your girl?
- Hey, what do they call you?
Hey, look at that!
What's your name, doll?
What's your name?
Hey, she's a beauty.
Let's go find a saloon.
Smile, boys.
Give them their money's worth.
Hey, Doc, how's the tour going for you?
Where exactly are you staying?
- Oh, I'm not sure yet.
- Just forget about that.
- Who's the dreamboat?
- Hey, Rene, a big smile.
Come on, one more shot.
Senator, I'd like you to meet Corpsman John Bradley.
- Doc, right?
- Yes, sir.
Good to meet you.
Now, we appreciate everything you've done and everything you're doing.
- Thank you, sir.
This is Captain White.
- Colonel Johns.
- We're proud of you, corpsman.
And then Colonel McCourtney.
- Major General Green.
- Nice to meet you.
Senator, this is Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Of course.
Now, I hear you used a tomahawk on those Japs, is that true, chief?
No, sir.
Well, tell them you did.
Makes a better story, huh?
- Attaboy.
- This is Captain Green.
John?
Madeline Evelley.
I recognize you from all the photographs.
I'm Hank's mom.
It's so nice to meet you, ma'am.
Hank was always talking about you.
- This is PFC Rene Gagnon.
- Pleasure to meet you, son.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thanks for everything.
- My pleasure.
- Not at all.
Ira, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Strank, Mike's mom.
It's all right.
When I got the telegram, I...
I don't know what I'm trying to say here.
Knowing he was with you that day and seeing him in that photograph I don't know why it makes me feel better, but it does.
- It's so silly, isn't it?
- No, it's not.
How are you, son?
Thank you very much.
We're the largest furniture wholesaler in Illinois.
- Thank you.
Excuse me.
- I'll make sure he calls.
- Well, thank you.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
Are you Rene?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Franklin's mother.
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.
I'm Pauline, Rene's girlfriend.
Would you mind?
Paper said that's Hank and I honestly can't tell.
It's horrible of a mother not to know her own son, isn't it?
But that's him, isn't it?
Well, to be honest, ma'am, it happened so quick and with everything that was going on it's hard to remember who was where.
But yeah, I think that's where he was.
That's Hank.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Excuse us.
Take him outside.
I'm Pauline.
Nice to meet you.
He was the best Marine I ever knew.
Thank you.
- You okay, chief?
- Christ.
- I'm okay.
- Yeah, you look it.
You're gonna screw this up, aren't you?
You're gonna screw it up for all of us.
I've got him.
Get some sleep, Ira.
- Mike?
- Yeah?
- Do you see this?
- What?
- Mike?
- Oh, shit, go!
He's killing me!
Hey, Doc, you think they got them all?
- What?
- Well, they're not shooting at us.
Maybe we killed them all or they ran off in the night.
Or they're waiting for us to start climbing.
Third Platoon!
Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.
- Just us?
- Yeah, just us, lgg.
All right, Third Platoon, move!
I tag along?
You can lead the way, if you want.
Get a good shot of my face.
It's your ass I'm gonna make famous, Hank.
Hey, that'll work for me too.
Lieutenant, if you make it to the top, put this up.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, Iggy.
They never shoot at the first patrol.
- They don't?
- No.
They want us to go up, signal that it's okay then shoot everybody else as they come up the mountain.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Unless, of course, they want to make an example of us and discourage the others.
I think you're full of crap, you know that, Hank?
Really?
Jesus.
Thank God that ain't us.
Told you.
Boots, spread them out and put them on a line.
Set up a perimeter!
First Squad!
- Hank?
Find me a pole.
- Yeah.
Right here.
Let's put this flag up.
Watch it.
Right over here.
Here, here.
That's good.
Right here, right here.
Got that end?
Hold that steady.
Lindberg.
- Hey, who's got rope?
- Right here.
- Give me something...
Yeah, good.
- That work?
Do it, fellas.
Keep it coming.
USMC!
USMC!
- Shit, look!
- Look at that!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Jeez, look at that.
Get down!
Take cover!
Cover with that.30!
- Watch it!
Twenty yards down, Hank!
- You see them?
- I got about 20 yards, left side.
- Lindberg, get the flamethrower!
Boots, you see them?
Cover right!
- About 20 yards down!
Duck one!
- You see them?
Keep the cover on!
Second Squad, you see them?
Get me some grenades!
I see them!
- You see them?
- Right flank, over to the right!
Cover me, I'm going down!
Careful, Iggy.
Easy.
All clear!
Okay, guys, who wants to be famous?
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
- Goddamn it.
Strank!
- Sir?
They want a phone line run up to the top of the mountain.
Let me guess, they picked us.
Second Platoon, let's go.
Get some exercise.
Let's go.
Get off your ass.
Oh, shit!
Hope it still works, because you're not getting mine.
- Get Forrestal!
- All right.
I don't know whose idea it was, Mr. Secretary.
Well, it was goddamned brilliant.
I want that flag, Holland.
Mark my words raising that son of a bitch means a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.
I want that flag.
Yes, sir.
I'll make sure no one touches it.
You can count on me.
Fuck that.
That flag belongs to the men in this battalion.
That son of a bitch thinks our men died taking this ground so we could hand our flag to some politician to pin to his wall?
He's out of his goddamn mind!
Get me that flag and find another one to replace it.
You've gotta be shitting me.
Gagnon!
Get your ass over here.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey, fellas.
- How you doing?
Missed a beautiful shot, Joe.
It's that kind of day.
- Hey, Mike.
- Hell of a view, lieutenant.
Lieutenant!
Captain says he wants that flag.
- He wants this flag?
- Yes, sir.
- We just put the damn thing up.
- Yes, sir.
Some kind of flag shortage?
He wants you to put this one up instead.
Hey, Mike.
- Do me a favor.
Put this up, will you?
- Yes, sir.
All right, let's find a pole.
Take the flag down, boys.
Captain's orders.
You heard him, let's do it.
- There you go.
- Lordy, she's a heavy one.
All right, hang on.
Put this on.
One hell of a view.
Good view from up here.
Yes, I'd say so myself.
All right.
- Not in your way here, am I, Joe?
- No, I'm fine, thanks.
Hey, Doc, you wanna give us a hand here?
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.
Ready?
Ready?
Let's go.
Did you get it?
I don't know.
I wish I could've seen their faces.
Nobody even noticed that second flag going up.
Everybody saw that damn picture and made up their own story about it.
But your dad and the others knew what they had done and what they had not.
All your friends dying it's hard enough to be called a hero for saving somebody's life.
But for putting up a pole?
You gotta be kidding.
Hey!
It took a lot of talented folks a long time to make that thing.
Wait till tonight, when it's lit properly, there's thousands of cheering people.
It's gonna look a lot better.
So stadium lights come down, spotlight comes up, you get your cue.
Charge up this thing with the flag, plant it at the top.
You smile, you wave.
You know the drill.
You want us to plant the flag on a pile of papier-mâché.
Hey, that's show biz.
And try and stand how you stood the first time you planted it.
You know, pretend the other three guys are with you.
The dead guys.
Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, not a problem.
- Good.
But where do we imagine Hank is standing?
Sorry?
Seeing that he wasn't there, it'll be kind of hard for us to leave a space for him.
I think you know exactly where he was.
You pointed him out to his mother.
This is bullshit.
I planted that damn thing once and I'm not doing it again.
- Hayes.
- For chrissake.
Hayes.
Hayes, get your ass back here or you're going on report.
Hayes!
You wanna do your damn job?
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Come on!
Come on!
He's with me!
Hey, he's with me!
- Back off!
- Sir, he's with me, okay?
He's with me.
Ira, put the goddamn chair down!
- Put the chair down, son!
- Put the chair down, Ira!
Tell them drop their sticks!
They're cops.
They're supposed to have nightsticks.
You're not supposed to be swinging a chair.
- Calm down, son.
- Sir, turn around, please.
That poster right there?
The one on the end, that's him.
- That's him?
- Yes, sir.
Do you read the papers?
Oh, Christ.
We got another fucking hero.
Get him out of here.
- Can you do that?
- Yes, sir.
Put the goddamn chair down.
And let's go.
Did you start this?
He didn't serve me!
I don't make the rules.
We don't serve Indians.
He needs to go sleep it off.
Soldier Field.
You hear that?
What the hell is that?
I can't figure it out.
Keep an eye out.
Hey, it sounds like it's coming from up there.
They're using grenades.
They're killing themselves.
Ira, let's go.
Come on.
Let's go, Ira.
Come on.
Thank God.
Jesus.
Look at you, chief.
You found him.
Holy shit.
You would have to pick today.
Vandegrift is here with enough brass to start a fucking band.
- Come on, let's go.
Can you walk?
- Yes, sir.
By yourself?
All right, look.
I don't care if you have to carry him.
Get him to the top, plant that flag, and don't fucking fall off.
Get him in his stuff.
I'll stall these guys for as long as I can.
Hurry up.
Jesus Christ.
And now the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Cover!
Harlon!
Harlon!
Get your fire team up in that position!
O'Hare!
First Fire Team!
Work around!
B.A.R., you, other side of the ridge!
Covering fire, boys.
Go, go, go!
Jackson, work your team around to the left!
Cover!
Left flank!
Left flank!
Franklin, Gus, go check it out!
Hustle up, boys!
- We got them!
- Clear!
One hell of an experience.
Move out!
Cease fire!
They're my men!
You're targeting our men!
You're targeting our...
Get me another radio!
Sergeant?
Sergeant!
Mike!
Mike, Mike, Mike!
Mike?
Mike!
Here.
Hey, where's Doc?
Corpsman!
Oh, shit.
How's his breathing?
Harlon, move, buddy.
Hey, Mike.
Mike, Mike, can you hear us?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on, Mike.
Mike?
Mike, can you hear us?
Oh, Jesus.
All right, let's go!
Move out!
We need a hand over here.
I'm gonna get a stretcher.
Let's take him down, move him off the beach.
Ladies and gentlemen, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Corpsman!
Hank!
Hank!
Doc, they killed me.
Harlon!
Doc they killed me.
Come on, Harlon.
Harlon, stay with me.
Franklin!
- Franklin.
- I'm fine, Ira.
Corpsman!
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't.
He was right here.
Now, where the hell is he?
Lggy!
Lggy!
Shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Lggy!
Does it open?
Lggy!
Lggy!
Lggy, are you down there?
Lggy!
Can't tell who it is, but he's one of ours.
I had to go outside to throw up.
Look what they did to the poor son of a bitch.
You okay, chief?
Just let it go.
If that doesn't pry open their wallets, nothing will.
Jesus Christ, he's drunk.
Goddamn Indians.
Come on, chief.
Let's get you home.
That's not what I hear.
I called around, I'm not stupid.
He's been drunk since he started this damn tour, making a spectacle of himself.
Just about choked that poor woman at the reception, blubbering.
Jesus Christ, you're supposed to be watching these men.
- Yes, sir.
- He's making us look like regular asses.
With all due respect, he never wanted to come on this trip.
Had to pull him, kicking, screaming, off that boat.
He wants to be with his unit.
What unit?
They're all fucking dead.
This is how he honors those men, by drinking and throwing up and...?
You know what?
He wants it?
Great, we'll send him back.
Get him packed and on a train today.
He's an embarrassment to the uniform.
Yes, sir.
I'll do it.
Yeah, no, that's, that's good.
That's what I want.
I know it's a good thing raising the money and that, because we need it.
But I can't take them calling me a hero.
All I did was try not to get shot.
Some of the things I saw done, things I did they weren't things to be proud of, you know?
Mike.
Mike was a hero.
You ever meet him?
No.
Best Marine I ever met.
You know, chief, I think if Mike was sitting here instead of you he'd be saying the same thing about himself not being a hero.
Maybe.
He was a good guy.
But I think that he would be ashamed of me seeing me the way I am.
Think I could see my ma before they ship me off?
Think they'd do that?
See my ma?
I'm sorry, Ira.
We got stories now to tell our kids, I guess.
Keep your head down.
All aboard.
Good luck, chief.
Think I saw him once after that.
It was maybe six or seven years after the war.
I was working as a salesman, doing a lot of driving.
I was driving west across Texas.
I was trying to get where I was going so I could get home.
And I saw this guy hitchhiking on the side of the road.
And for a second, I thought it might've been him.
I'll always regret that I didn 't stop, but I was in a hurry.
And he was an Indian.
We always told the press Ira insisted that he was going back to fight with his unit which was at least partially true but that isn't what got the headlines.
We're engaged.
Excuse me a minute, darling.
- Hey, Doc?
- Yeah?
Got a minute?
- Yeah.
- I'll see you at the car.
- You hear I'm getting married?
- I did, Rene.
That's great.
Yeah, it's something she wants.
She waited for me all this time.
She's not used to all this, but she's a good girl.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
So I was wondering if you'd be my best man.
Me?
Don't you have somebody at home, a buddy you'd rather ask?
Well, I didn't really make many.
The ones who didn't go, it's, well, it's hard to even talk to them.
- You know.
- Yeah, I know.
I'd be proud to.
Thank you.
I better go drag her away from them before she announces I'm gonna be president of General Motors or something.
All right.
- Congratulations, honey.
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Rene, you're a lucky man.
- Here they are now.
- Here they come.
Grab a shot of them on the steps.
- Big smile, Mrs. Gagnon!
- Say cheese.
I couldn 't complain, because the press loved them so they wrote more articles and people bought more bonds.
The tour went on with just Rene and your dad.
And the true heroes are the men who didn't make it home from lwo Jima the men who died at Iwo Jima and in other campaigns.
We ask that you honor the memory of those men by buying the war bonds and helping us to win this war.
Thank you.
City after city, I thought the damn thing would never end.
And this rumor kept going around that the photograph had been staged.
Your dad said he wished he'd known he was having his picture taken because he would've ducked the hell out of it.
Was this your idea?
Whose idea was it?
Who wanted to stage the thing?
Was there truth to the rumor that that picture was staged, Doc?
- Come on!
Doc?
- Can you answer that?
I remember when your dad got shot.
All hell was busting loose.
People back home saw that picture and thought it was over when we took Suribachi.
We wished.
Anyways, we're pinned down.
Mortars, shells, machine guns.
Fire coming from every which direction, right?
And we hear somebody call, "Corpsman down."
Corpsman down!
Blood was spurting out of his throat and Doc was doing everything he could.
And the Corpsman looks up at him and he knows what this means, shot in the neck.
He knows he's dying, you can see that.
But still, in his eyes he's pleading with Doc to save his life.
And Doc can 't.
- You okay, Doc?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah, you look fine.
- I'm okay.
Keep down, all right?
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.
Okay.
Corpsman.
Corpsman!
For God's sake, corpsman.
Corpsman?
Corpsman.
Incoming!
Let me see.
It's not that bad, you're gonna be okay.
All right?
Just stay with me.
Look at me.
Took us a half-hour to find your dad.
He could've bled to death.
Coming down.
We got a chest wound.
Put pressure on it.
Thanks.
Vets will tell you about being hit but not wanting to leave their buddies.
Usually, they're lying.
You'll take any excuse to get out of there.
But it happens.
You get the feeling you're letting them down.
I could see that in your dad's face.
Oh, he wanted to go.
He'd seen enough.
But he didn't want to leave us.
Now, he was a hell of a good man, your dad.
Yeah.
While we were sitting there on the beach we heard this great roar.
And we looked up...
That was the first of thousands of landings on Iwo.
- Look at that.
- Yeah.
How about that.
I'm gonna head back, all right?
Good luck.
That island saved a lot of lives.
A lot of lives.
I don 't know what else to tell you.
After the bond tour, my dad finally got his operation.
By the time he got home, the war was over.
First thing he did was ask my mom to marry him.
Ira tried to get on with his life and put it all behind him.
Like to thank you for having me here today.
It's an honor to be in front of such a strong people.
Because of the war white men will understand Indians a lot better.
And it's going to be a better world.
But life had other plans for him.
You're...
You're him, aren't you?
You're the hero, right?
Great.
All right, kids, go get your picture taken.
Oh, that's great.
That's great.
All right, now say cheese.
- Cheese.
- Cheese.
That's great.
Okay.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Thanks.
- Come on.
- That's a hero, kids.
Hey, hero, lift this basket, will you?
It's too heavy for me.
Rene tried to take advantage of those offers he'd received on the bond tour.
Yes, G-A-G-N-O-N.
Right.
Pronounced "Rene."
Rene, yes.
I actually called last week.
Yes.
Okay, yes.
Mr. Gagnon.
I gave Mr. Tennack your message.
I'm sure he'll call you.
Okay.
All right thank you.
But he was yesterday's hero.
He even applied for a job at the local police station.
They said he wasn 't qualified.
After working the factory with Pauline he tried a few things but spent the rest of his life as a janitor.
But Ira...
Ira.
You got a visitor.
Ira always made the news.
I could never find out why he did it, but one day Ira just took off.
He walked and hitched over 1300 miles from Arizona to Texas.
He found Harlon Block's father working his field.
His wife, Belle, had left him soon after they discovered Harlon died.
She never forgave him for letting her son go off to war.
And Ira told him the truth.
That it had been his son who raised the flag with them his son in the photograph.
And then he just turned and walked away.
Though the flag-raising meant nothing to him he somehow knew it would mean everything to them.
Thanks for calling.
Just as Belle knew all along.
The press soon found out and called Hank's mom with the news that it wasn 't her son after all.
The last time they all saw each other was at the unveiling of the Marine Corps War Memorial.
And even though he'd planted the first flag above Iwo Jima Hank's mother and father weren 't invited.
Ira.
It's good to see you, Ira.
Hell of a statue.
It wasn 't long after that that they found Ira.
The papers said he died of exposure.
There was no autopsy.
It was about that same time my father got in his car early one morning telling my mom he had something to do.
He drove to a town on the other side of Wisconsin, where Iggy's mom lived.
Ever since she heard the news about her son she'd been trying to find out how he died, and no one would tell her.
I never found out what he told her but I can pretty much guarantee it wasn 't the truth.
My mother would ask him what was troubling him.
He would never say.
And every year, as it got close to Memorial Day the reporters would start calling, asking to interview my father.
No, I'm sorry, he's fishing in Canada.
We were always instructed to say the same thing.
Okay.
Thanks.
When Mr. McCandless retired my father bought the funeral home where he'd worked since coming home.
He spent the rest of his life running the business, raising his family.
He never spoke about the war or about the flag-raising.
Never told us anything.
The first time I heard any of these stories was after he died.
Where is he?
Oh, God.
He's not here, Dad.
He died.
Who?
Who died?
Lggy.
Iggy.
Christ, poor lggy.
I hadn't thought of him for years.
How do you know about Iggy?
You were calling for him.
When you collapsed.
I wasn't looking for Iggy.
I was looking for you.
I wanted to...
I wanted to tell you, I'm...
I'm sorry I wasn't a better father.
Talked to you more.
I just...
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
You were the best father a man could have.
Did I ever tell you they took us swimming?
No, Dad.
After we planted the flag, we came down off the mountain and they let us swim.
It was the funniest thing.
All this fighting and...
And we were jumping around in the water like kids.
That's the way I remember lggy now.
I finally came to the conclusion that maybe he was right.
Maybe there's no such thing as heroes.
Maybe there are just people like my dad.
I finally came to understand why they were so uncomfortable being called heroes.
Heroes are something we create, something we need.
It's a way for us to understand what is almost incomprehensible how people could sacrifice so much for us.
But for my dad and these men the risks they took, the wounds they suffered they did that for their buddies.
They may have fought for their country, but they died for their friends.
For the man in front, for the man beside them.
And if we wish to truly honor these men we should remember them the way they really were the way my dad remembered them.
Come on, Doc!

Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
For God sakes!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Honey, what's wrong?
Every jackass thinks he knows what war is.
Especially those who've never been in one.
We like things nice and simple, good and evil, heroes and villains.
There's always plenty of both.
Most of the time, they are not who we think they are.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where...
Where is he?
Where is he?
Mr. Bradley?
Mr. B?
You okay?
- Where is he?
- Where is who?
Where is he?
Where did he go?
Where...
Where is he?
All right.
Just stay right here, okay?
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
It'll be okay.
Where is he?
Most guys I knew would never talk about what happened over there.
Probably 'cause they're still trying to forget about it.
They certainly didn't think of themselves as heroes.
They died without glory.
Nobody has taken their pictures.
Only their buddies knew what they did.
I'd tell their folks they died for their country.
I'm not sure that was it.
Now, there were plenty other photos taken that day, but none anybody wanted to see.
What we see and do in war, the cruelty, is unbelievable.
But somehow we gotta make some sense of it.
To do that, we need a easy to understand truth and damn few words.
Film's ruined.
I don't know.
This one looks all right.
And if you can get a picture...
Now, the right picture can win or lose a war.
You're gonna want to see this.
Look at Vietnam.
The picture of that South Vietnamese officer blowing that fella's brains out of the side of his head, whammo!
That was it.
The war was lost.
We just hung around trying to pretend it wasn't.
Took a lot of other pictures that day.
None of them made a difference.
Thanks.
Appreciate it.
Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.
Country was bankrupt.
People were becoming cynical and tired of war.
Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon!
Where?
Right there.
Planting that flag, that's your brother.
Ma, all you can see is his behind.
And that's his.
I powdered and diapered it, I know my son.
That's him.
Go get your father.
Daddy, Ma's got a picture of Harlon's keister in the paper.
You watch your mouth, young man.
Thank you.
One photo, almost all on its own, turned that around.
It's on the front page of every major paper.
Over 200 dailies and they're all flooded with requests for prints.
I think we might have found it.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- I gotta go get him.
- Oh, no, you don't.
Iggy, I gotta go.
I have a whole different theory.
He wants medical attention bad enough, he'll come to us.
Shut up and crawl over here, you lazy son-of-a-bitch!
As soon as that flare goes out.
- Crap.
Okay, well, I'll go with you.
- No.
You're actually gonna leave me here?
I'll be right back, just shoot some people.
I gotta go.
Oh, God.
Okay, it's okay.
Don't touch them.
Don't touch them.
Get your hands out of there.
Let me do that.
I'll do it, okay?
Don't look.
Keep your head back.
Keep your eyes on me.
All right, look at me.
I'll get it.
I'll take care of it.
We'll get this bandage on you.
We'll get you taken care of.
And we'll get you down to the bottom, all right?
Look, you're gonna be fine.
It's okay.
I'll do that.
I'll do that.
Here, put some pressure on that.
Put your hands on top and put some pressure on it.
Keep your head back.
Keep breathing.
Keep looking at me, all right?
Just keep looking at...
Doc.
Help me.
Help me.
All right.
Okay.
How's that feel?
- It feels good.
- It does?
All right.
- Good.
- All right.
I'm gonna go get a stretcher and get you down to the beach.
I'll be right back.
I'm all right.
Go and help someone who's hurt.
All right.
Hold on there.
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Holy shit.
They expect us to climb this?
Or something just like it.
So, where you think they're sending us?
I think it's the desert, Franklin.
Well, that makes no sense at all.
Well, it's just military psychology.
They always train you for the desert on a volcano.
Now you're just having fun with me.
Harlon, take your men right.
- Watch for Bedouins.
- Yes, sir.
- What's a Bedouin?
- It's a guy with a camel.
Well, Jeez Louise, maybe we are going to the desert.
Now, you tilt that to the right, but what if the bullet comes from the left?
Bullets don't come from the left.
You know any left-handed Japs?
That makes about as much sense as you showering with your shoes on.
You don't even know why you do it, do you?
'Cause I don't tell you mean I don't know?
You do it 'cause Mike does it.
I'll ask him.
So you cut hair back home?
Some.
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?
No, I just studied it a little.
But not in barber school?
Nope.
- Gosh.
- Let me guess, Hayes is winning.
Chief, I had very little to do with Sitting Bull's death, so maybe you could stop taking it out on me.
Different tribe.
The Pimas fought on the side of the white man.
- See, now that's smart.
- That is smart.
Yeah.
Worked real good for us.
Good luck, fellas.
Hey, good night, Lindberg.
Dead bodies.
He cuts hair on dead bodies.
What?
Even I knew that.
- Who's in?
- Oh, I'm in.
I'm in.
It must be a lot easier with them not moving around and all.
- There's that.
- Yeah.
You know what I been thinking?
Well, they been telling us we need to buddy up and I think we'd make pretty good buddies.
And how do you figure that?
Well, you know, in that we have a lot in common.
So, why do you cut dead people's hair, anyway?
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.
You tell a lot of people that?
You actually chose the Marines because they got the best uniform?
No sense being a hero if you don't look like one.
Jacks.
Queens.
Shit.
Do anything on that reservation but play cards, Chief?
All right, listen up, you sorry bunch of leathernecks!
We practice going over the side tomorrow which means we ain't long for this piece of rock.
All right!
One more thing, any man who doesn't have his masturbation papers in order better get them signed by tomorrow night or he ain't going overseas.
- I got mine already.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm square.
Wait.
Why am I just hearing about this?
That's horseshit, Franklin.
I don't have to repeat everything twice for you.
No, I didn't hear nothing about no masturbating papers.
Heard they were running short.
You know, nobody tells me nothing.
That's real nice, guys.
All right, get your ass over to the officer in charge of records.
Maybe he got some more left.
- Leave your smokes.
I'll play for you.
- Thanks, Mike.
Listen, he calls you an idiot, you take it like a man, okay?
Just do not leave without signing them.
- I appreciate it, Sergeant.
- You got it.
What the hell happened to your hair, Rene?
Look like a goddamn corpse.
Three points of contact on that rope at all times.
Next four.
Over the side.
Let's go.
Keep moving.
Next four, over the side.
Just keep your eye on the guy below you.
That's all you gotta look at.
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.
Keep three points of contact on the rope at all times.
You see?
No big thing.
Just one step at a time and keep your hands on the vertical rope.
Remember, once you're in the boat move away from the rope.
Just make sure you keep three points of contact on the rope.
I got him!
All right, get that man out of the water.
Give me a hand.
Grab his pack.
Don't worry about him, Doc.
All right, quit skylarking!
Keep it moving!
He'll be fine.
Our target, Island X, is an ugly, smelly, dirty little scab of rock called Iwo Jima.
It means "Sulfur Island," which accounts for the smell.
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop, you ask me.
After 20 straight days of bombing you won't find a blade of grass or a twig on it.
It wasn't that pretty to start with.
Captain?
Iwo's just five-and-a-half miles long, two-and-a-half wide.
There's a lump down at the bottom.
That's Mount Suribachi.
On the maps in front of you the island is white.
Not much of it.
The black dots represent known enemy emplacements.
Coastal defense guns, dual-mount dual-purpose guns, covered artillery emplacements.
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes, and earth-covered structures.
I don't see any barracks or any other structures.
That's right.
And we still don't know why.
Now, this isn't just any island to them.
This isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, or Saipan.
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders in eight square miles.
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.
It's up to us to convince them.
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.
The 8th Ammo Company will land here to re-supply.
The Suribachi's guns are the biggest problem.
They can hit any point on the island.
We're sitting ducks until we take them out.
That's our job.
We cut across the island, right at the base, slit its throat, lop off its head.
And we take that mountain.
We take that mountain, we take their big guns.
We take their eyes.
Okay, I'm heading in.
Follow me.
Let's put a good show on for the Marines.
Close it up.
Take it right down to the deck.
Yeah, boys!
Man overboard portside!
See him?
Throw me a line!
He's right there.
- Where is he?
- Watch out, watch out, watch out.
Hawaii's that way!
Just keep paddling, Mac, we'll catch you on the way back!
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!
They're not gonna stop.
What?
None of them are.
They can't.
So much for "No man left behind. "
- Sir.
- Come on in.
Look, I've had to make a few other changes.
I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
- You bet.
Trouble is, I already told my men I'd see them through this.
That your James Cagney impersonation?
'Cause I've heard better.
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.
Look, this isn't your first time through this.
- You don't need to prove anything.
- No, sir.
You're not the best sergeant I've ever had, you're just the best one that's still walking.
- Block's a good man.
- Yes, sir, he is.
The men know him, he can step right in.
You know, I have actually thought this through.
Platoon sergeant puts you further away from the bullets.
I already gave them my word, sir.
I told them I'd bring them all home to their mothers which means I already lied to half of them.
Can't lie to the rest.
- How are your men?
- They'll do fine.
Except maybe Gagnon.
Our own Tyrone Power?
Yes, sir.
He's a good man, just might be better use further back from the lines.
I'll use him as a runner.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
Now get out of here.
Hear the good news, Doc?
We're going in with the first waves.
Hey, you do that again I'll take your head off!
Fucking dominoes.
Iggy, have you ever heard news you considered to be bad?
The first ones off the ship, Doc.
Means we don't go over the side of the ship.
We hop on a tractor, they drive us right there.
Oh, shit, that is good news.
You see?
What'd I tell you?
What's going on?
Look at that.
We're killing them!
We're killing them, Doc.
I was promised 10 days of shelling.
You're giving me three and saying that's the best you can do?
I don't give a shit!
My men hit that beach with less than 10 and I'll be taking them home to their mamas in buckets!
Yeah, I know exactly why.
Because every Navy man with a scrambled egg on his chest wants to offload us here and sail to Japan so they can be there for the big finish, tell their kids they captured the Emperor all by themselves.
Well, you aren't going to Japan unless we take this piece of shit island!
These little pricks are dug in!
Okay, appreciate that, Jim.
Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
I'm okay.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
Jesus, Iggy, just leave me alone, all right?
How about you guys?
Knife?
Bayonet?
Kick in the ass?
How about you, Doc?
Sharpen your knife?
You sharpened it three times already.
Well, then I better make sure I didn't nick it.
Good man, Doc.
- Hey, Doc.
- Yeah.
When we land, try not to wave this kit around too much.
They got sharpshooters that are trained to look for them.
And they know that if they take out a corpsman another dozen Marines will die unattended.
All right?
Okay, Mike.
Yeah, right there.
Close the damn door.
For God's sake.
Yeah, like that's gonna help.
That your girlfriend, Chief?
Bet she's a pretty damn good-looking squaw.
Bet you're missing her, and that little wigwam of yours.
Welcome, all Marines off Iwo Jima.
We have a long-time wait...
It's what they do to prisoners,
- at least the lucky ones.
- Jesus.
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think about waving a white bandanna.
Poor Marines, so far from home for no good reason.
Think of your girls back home, waiting for you.
But a girl cannot stay home every night.
So who do you think they're with tonight?
And will she let him kiss her?
And will he comfort her at your funeral?
This sweet music is to make you think of your girls back home who are missing you.
This is all for now.
I'll see you tomorrow night.
Gunners!
Move, let's go!
Let's go, get up on the berm!
Gunners!
We're clear!
Get up the berm!
Baker Company, move out!
- Seen Second Platoon?
- I don't see them.
First Squad, move it out!
God, this place reeks.
- Go, go, go!
- Move out!
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go!
Go!
Go, go!
Drop your packs!
Go!
All clear!
- Jesus, you needed some exercise?
- He got lost.
A hundred landing craft heading for one beach and this guy gets lost.
Now I'm glad we did.
Jesus, what a mess.
Any theories why they ain't shooting?
It's getting on my nerves.
Maybe they're all dead.
What do you think, Doc?
You think they're all dead?
Mike, take six men and bring that gun onto the beach.
Second Platoon, let's move out!
Stay down.
Come on.
Move!
Move!
- Get down!
- Take cover!
Move out!
Cover fire!
Pour it on!
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!
Corpsman!
I'm gonna sling your arm and then I'll give you a shot for the pain!
Move, move!
Off the beach!
Take cover!
You got a girl back home, Marine?
We're gonna make sure she sees you, all right?
I need pressure on this wound!
Where's the fire coming from?
Where are they?
Look for a flash, shoot at it!
Let's go, let...
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!
You're over!
Third Squad, forward!
Move!
Where are they, sir?
We got ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock, pillbox!
Sergeant!
- Sergeant!
I think I can clear that out.
- What?
All right, you go.
Here.
Take these.
Check your weapon.
Yeah?
Go!
Cover!
Cover him!
Cover, cover!
Son-of-a-bitch.
Let's go!
Go!
Move it out!
Go, go, go!
Down, down, down!
It's clear.
Good work.
I thought you said it was clear!
It was!
Shit, I guess they're not in there firing at us then.
Lindberg!
Yeah!
Light it up!
I'll cover you, Ice!
Don't cover shit!
There's already enough people shooting!
One bullet and this thing goes up like a Roman candle!
Go!
Shift fire!
Shift your fire!
Go, go!
Shift your fire!
Shift your fire!
Go!
Move it out!
Hit the deck!
Stay down!
Wait for support!
Is this a bad battle or what?
It's a fucking slaughter.
Christ Jesus!
Get a machine gun team set up over here, now!
Thank God!
Tanks!
Runner!
Get those tanks up here!
Oh, shit.
Get down!
Corporal, watch your left flank!
Let's go without them!
Move out!
Move out!
Iggy, you gotta lift your side, he's gonna roll off.
Got it, Doc!
Incoming!
Move, move, move, move!
Keep moving!
Get that LVT up on the beach!
Keep moving!
You're next, pal, we're getting you out of here.
Move it!
Great news.
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa, 'cause that's where we're headed.
Not you and me.
Captain Severance asked me who else was in that picture, and Christ if I could remember, but it was Mike and Doc and Franklin and me and Hank Hansen but I just remembered, you were there, too.
I wasn't there.
'Course you were.
Neither was Hank.
He raised the first flag.
It was Harlon Block that raised that one.
Shit.
I told them it was Hank.
You weren't there, Mr. Smart Ass, how'd you know it was Harlon?
- You tell them it was me?
- No.
Like I said, I just remembered.
Good, keep your mouth shut.
They know there was somebody else, you can see it in the picture.
Then pick someone dead.
They don't want somebody dead, you dumb redskin, they want to ship us back to the States.
What did I tell you?
I wasn't there.
- You hear?
- All right.
Just settle down.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're not going anywhere.
Who the hell says?
This is horseshit.
You wounded, son?
No, sir.
Well, did you take out a nest of Japs butt-naked with your bare hands?
'Cause if I'm gonna give up my seat to a hero he better have a good goddamn story to tell.
No, sir.
Then enjoy it, 'cause they'll forget you before Christmas.
The sixth man, you got a name?
Sorry, still don't remember.
It's a damn shame, 'cause I promised the Major you'd know who it was.
Fact, you not knowing throws a doubt on you being one of the flag-raisers yourself.
Since no one wants to be embarrassed, the moment you land they'll turn you around, ship you off to Okinawa in time to meet your buddies on the beach.
So, why don't you stop screwing with me?
Give me a damn name.
Gangway!
Gangway!
Let's go, let's go!
Gangway!
Where the hell is that son-of-a-bitch?
Hayes!
Hayes?
Hayes, get your red ass over here!
Make me look like I don't know what my own men are doing with a flag the size of my mother's house?
God damn it, Ira, you shouldn't have lied to me.
You made me look like a complete asshole.
We're gonna miss you around here.
Good luck.
Now your name's in the paper, too.
Just heard your doctor say we're postponing your operation.
You're being shipped back to the mainland.
Everybody who saw that picture thought planting the flag meant victory.
That's all they wanted to know.
Victory.
Within a few weeks of that picture being taken, half the men in it were dead.
Mrs. Hansen!
Mrs. Hansen!
Did you know Hank was a hero?
- Are you proud of him, Mrs. Hansen?
- What was he like as a boy?
Look this way, please, ma'am.
What do you have to say about your son?
But somehow being a part of it meant something.
Looking at it, you could believe their sacrifice was not a waste.
Yeah, I might have thought that was Harlon, too.
It is.
Belle, their names are right here.
It's not him.
And he would be alive and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.
You think about that when you look at his picture, Ed.
And I need to rush home and change because there's the Governor's banquet and then there's the parade.
Imagine, the Governor is coming here to meet us.
Now, I'm wearing blue so, if...
- Are you going to change?
- We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin from CBS World News.
A press association has just announced that President Roosevelt is dead.
The President died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
All we know so far is that the President died at Warm Springs in Georgia.
Further updates every hour.
Temperatures will remain the same today, in the mid-30s to low 40s with clear skies.
Hello?
Yes.
Of course.
No, we understand.
It wouldn't be right.
Thank you.
Here he is, gentlemen.
Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.
Senator Haddigan.
I'd like you to meet Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Damn good to meet you.
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.
Sorry?
That's Pima Indian talk, boy, don't you know your own language?
Took forever to memorize the damn gibberish.
Sorry, I've been away from the reservation too long, Senator.
- Doc.
- Ira.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
- That's you.
- Go, go, go, go.
Go.
Please welcome
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley,
Private First Class Ira Hayes,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon!
Holy shit.
Come in, come in, come in.
Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Bud Gurber.
- You showing the boys the sights?
- We saw a hell of a ball game.
That's great.
The bar's there, help yourself.
I got some briefing sheets for you here, just some simple things we want you to say.
Mostly, "Buy bonds," can't say that too often.
Itineraries, those are changing every couple minutes.
Everybody wants to meet you guys.
I got women sending up envelopes with stockings in them, notes written in lipstick.
We won't mention that to the press, am I right?
Have a drink, for Christ's sake.
My God, what you boys must have seen over there.
I've been watching the newsreels.
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.
So, we got a hell of a lot of money to raise, not a lot of time.
White House tomorrow, then we trot you over to shake hands with a couple of hundred Congressmen who won't pull a penny out of their pockets.
Politicians and actors.
You put them in a restaurant together, they'd die of old age before picking up the check.
Then New York City, Times Square, dinners with various hoi polloi, then Chicago...
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?
That's what we're calling the mothers of the dead flag-raisers.
You present each mother with a flag, they say a few words, people will shit money.
It'll be so moving.
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.
Lovely woman.
She knows how close you and her son were.
He wrote home about you.
She is very, very much looking forward to meeting you.
Hank wasn't in the picture.
Sorry?
Hank didn't raise that flag.
He raised the other one, the real flag.
The what?
The real...
The real flag?
There's a real flag?
Yeah, ours was the replacement flag.
We put it up when they took the other one down.
Am I the only one getting a headache here?
You know about this?
It was after it was already in the papers.
The mothers had already been told, but...
That's it, that's beautiful.
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Yeah, why tell me?
I'm only the guy that has to explain it to 150 million Americans.
Who is in the goddamn picture?
Are any of you guys in the goddamn picture?
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.
Six guys raising a flag over Iwo Jima.
Victory is ours.
You're three of them, right?
This was the fifth day, sir.
The battle went on for 35 more.
Well, what'd you do, raise a goddamn flag every time you stopped for lunch?
Can I hit this guy?
You know what, I don't give a shit, you're in the picture, you raised the flag, that's the story we're selling, boys.
Are you deaf?
Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?
Harlon Block.
That's whose mother should be here if anyone's should be.
You know, I think this whole damn thing is a farce, you ask me.
You know what they're calling this bond drive?
The Mighty Seventh.
They might've called it the
"We're Flat Fucking Broke And Can't Even Afford Bullets
"So We're Begging For Your Pennies" bond drive, but it didn't have quite the ring.
They could've called it that, though, because the last four bond drives came up so short we just printed money instead.
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street, he'll tell you our dollar is next to worthless, we borrowed so much.
And nobody is lending any more.
Ships aren't being built.
Tanks aren't being built.
Machine guns, bazookas, hand grenades, zip.
You think this is a farce?
You want to go back to your buddies?
Well, stuff some rocks in your pockets before you get on the plane because that's all we got left to throw at the Japanese.
And don't be surprised if your plane doesn't make it off the runway because the fuel dumps are empty.
And our good friends, the Arabs, are only taking bullion.
If we don't raise $14 billion, and that's million with a "B," this war is over by the end of the month.
We make a deal with the Japanese, we give whatever they want and we come home, because you've seen them fight, and they sure as shit ain't giving up.
$14 billion.
The last three drives didn't make that much all together.
People on the street corners, they looked at this picture and they took hope.
Don't ask me why, I think it's a crappy picture myself.
You can't even see your faces.
But it said we can win this war, are winning this war, we just need you to dig a little deeper.
They want to give us that money.
No, they want to give it to you.
But you, you don't want to ask for it.
You don't want to give them hope.
You want to explain about this person and that flag.
Well, that's your choice.
Because if we admit we made a mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about and that will be that.
Gentlemen.
Mr. President, here they are.
- Well, hello.
Good to see you.
- Mr. President.
Darn good to see you, boys.
Heard you had a hell of a fight on your hands out there, hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation in Arizona, am I right?
Yes, Mr. President.
Being an Indian, you are a truer American than any of us.
Bet your people are proud to see you wear that uniform.
Very proud, sir.
They should be.
Well, I want to thank you for coming all this way to Washington to help us out.
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific now we need you to fight for a mountain of cash.
- And I don't expect you'll let us down.
- No, sir.
Good.
Go get it.
That's the end of this ceremony.
Let's take a look at this famous photo over here, see if I can pick you out.
My gosh.
There you are.
Boys.
Boys, this one's on me.
To those who can't be with us.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon.
May we have your autograph?
I suppose.
And your name is?
I don't know about you, but I get the impression
I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.
You're such a hero.
I feel honored to be in your presence.
That's just not true.
That's professional work.
Here, to professionals.
Here they are.
You're the guys in the photograph, right?
I heard you were on the train.
Let me shake your hands, John Tennack.
John Bradley.
These boys are with me, Harvard and Yale types, didn't fight a lick.
Pappies all rich sons-of-bitches.
Boys, shake hands with some real war heroes.
Excuse me for one moment.
You can buy them a drink while you're at it.
That's right.
Drinks for these men all the way around.
And you're the other one, aren't you?
John Tennack, Tennack Homes.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Pleased to meet you.
Have a drink, come on.
And here's my card.
Listen to me, Rene, when you get finished being famous you come see me because if you can sell bonds, you can sell homes.
Now, they're not gonna build homes anymore, they're gonna deliver them.
- You heard of prefab homes?
- No, sir.
Well, you will.
And you hang on to that card and you come see me, you hear?
- All right?
- Certainly will.
All right.
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?
If Mike and the guys could see us.
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it, would they?
Harlon!
Franklin!
Can you imagine Franklin on this train
eating at the dining car with all the silver?
We shouldn't be here, Doc.
There's gonna be a Hallelujah Day
When the boys have all come home to stay
And a million bands begin to play
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
And when we've lit the torch of liberty
In each blacked-out land across the sea
Ira!
Hey, Ira!
We heard the picture was posed!
What?
We heard you posed the picture!
Hey, Doc!
We're bigger than life, Doc!
And we'll heave a mighty sigh
When each gal can kiss the boy she kissed goodbye
And they'll come marching down Fifth Avenue
The United Nations in review
When this lovely dream has all come true
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
Good job.
Thank you.
Thank you, girls!
And now, here are the men you've been waiting to meet, the men in white.
Right behind me here, the heroes of Iwo Jima,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon,
Private First Class Ira Hayes, and Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley!
Thank you.
It's good of you people to come out tonight in support of the war effort.
We really need you to buy bonds, that's for sure.
'Cause we can't win the war without your help.
As far as us being the heroes of Iwo Jima, that's just not the case.
We really didn't do much at all.
Especially him.
Especially me.
I was just a runner.
That's it.
We put up a flag.
The pole we attached it to was heavy, so it took a number of us.
We had our picture taken doing it.
The real heroes are dead on that island.
And we'd appreciate it if you bought bonds in honor of them.
Thank you.
Jump on any grenades, Ira?
Take out any machine gun nests I missed?
At least I fired my weapon.
All right, knock it off.
You hit anything or were you too drunk then, too?
What?
Guys!
Come on!
Stop it.
Knock it off.
The tall man with the high hat will be coming down your way
Get your savings out when you hear him shout
"Any bonds today?"
Any bonds today?
Bonds of freedom that's what I'm selling
Any bonds today?
Rene, right here.
Sit between these two boys.
Here comes the freedom man
Asking you to buy a share of freedom today ...for us and they need our help.
And, if you think about it, I think you'll realize that buying more bonds is not just the right thing to do but the only thing to do.
Yes, this war has gone on too long.
We have given too many lives.
And its cost...
- Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
- Strawberry.
...has been far too high.
But if we waver now, if we don't dig deep and give more than we think we can then those sacrifices would be wasted...
Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
...and those lives lost in vain.
Let's move!
Go, go!
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over.
Where the hell are our tanks?
Stuck in the sand.
Captain says you're to go without them.
Christ.
That's real good work you're doing there, Rene.
All right, prepare to move out.
Pass the word.
Second Platoon!
Move!
Move!
Move!
All right, Second Platoon, on your feet!
Let's move out!
Jackass.
Let's move out!
Go, go!
Move, move, move!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Second Platoon, move out!
Doc!
Doc, get out of there!
Corpsman!
Doc!
Doc, get the hell out of there!
May I have your attention, please.
Train number 48 with service from New York City, Boston,
Rochester, New York,
Toledo, Ohio, and South Bend, Indiana is now arriving on Track 7.
Train number 48 now arriving on Track number 7.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.
- Come on, boys.
- Let's go.
- Watch your step, ma'am.
- Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the heroes of Iwo Jima.
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.
Private First Class Ira Hayes.
And Private First Class Rene Gagnon.
Rene!
That's my boyfriend!
Who the hell is that?
I don't know.
- Rene, is that your girl?
- Hey, what do they call you?
How about a photo?
Hey, look at that!
What's your name, doll?
What's your name?
Hey, she's a beauty.
Let's go find a saloon.
Smile, boys.
Give them their money's worth.
Hey, Doc, how's the tour going for you?
Thank you.
Where exactly are you staying?
- I'm not sure yet.
- Just forget about that.
Senator, I'd like you to meet Corpsman John Bradley.
- Doc, right?
- Yes, sir.
Nice to meet you, Senator.
Good to meet you, young man.
Now, we appreciate everything you've done and everything you're doing.
- Thank you, sir.
- Quite all right.
This is Captain White.
- Colonel Johns.
- We're proud of you, Corpsman.
And then Colonel McCourtney.
- Major General Green.
- Nice to meet you.
Senator, this is Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Of course!
Now I hear you used a tomahawk on those Japs.
Is that true, Chief?
No, sir.
Well, tell them you did, makes a better story, huh?
- Attaboy.
- This is Captain Green.
John?
Madeline Evelley.
I recognize you from all the photographs.
I'm Hank's mom.
It's so nice to meet you, ma'am.
Hank was always talking about you.
This is PFC Rene Gagnon.
Pleasure to meet you, son.
Thanks for everything.
- My pleasure.
- Not at all.
Ira, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Strank, Mike's mom.
It's all right.
When I got the telegram, I...
I don't know what I'm trying to say here.
Knowing he was with you that day and seeing him in that photograph,
I don't know why it makes me feel better, but it does.
- It's so silly, isn't it?
- No, it's not.
How are you, son?
Thank you very much.
We're the largest furniture wholesaler in Illinois.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
- I'll make sure he calls.
- Well, thank you.
Thank you.
Are you Rene?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Franklin's mother.
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.
I'm Pauline, Rene's girlfriend.
Would you mind?
Paper said that's Hank, and I honestly can't tell.
It's horrible of a mother not to know her own son, isn't it?
But that's him, isn't it?
Well, to be honest, ma'am, it happened so quick, and with everything that was going on it's kind of hard to remember who was where.
But...
Yeah, I think...
I think that's where he was.
That's Hank.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Excuse us.
Take him outside.
I'm Pauline.
- Very nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
He was the best Marine I ever knew.
Thank you.
- You okay, Chief?
- Oh, Christ!
I'm okay.
Yeah, you look it.
You're gonna screw this up, aren't you?
You're gonna screw it up for all of us.
I've got him.
Get some sleep, Ira.
- Mike?
- Yeah?
- You see this?
- What?
- Mike!
- Oh, shit, go!
He's killing me!
Hey, Doc, you think they got them all?
What?
Well, they're not shooting at us.
Maybe we killed them all.
Or they ran off in the night or something.
Or they're waiting for us to start climbing.
Third Platoon!
Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.
- Just us?
- Yeah, just us, Igg.
All right, Third Platoon, move!
I tag along?
Yeah, you can lead the way if you want.
Get a good shot of my face.
It's your ass I'm gonna make famous, Hank.
Hey, that'll work for me, too.
Lieutenant, if you make it to the top, put this up.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, Iggy.
They never shoot at the first patrol.
- They don't?
- No.
They want us to go up to the top, signal to the others that it's okay, then shoot everybody else as they come up the mountain.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Unless of course they want to make an example of us and discourage all the others.
I think you're full of crap, you know that, Hank?
Really?
Jesus.
Thank God that ain't us.
Told you.
Boots, spread them out and put them on a line.
Set up a perimeter!
First Squad!
- Hank?
Find me a pole.
- Yeah.
Let's put this flag up.
Watch it.
Right over here.
Right here.
That's good.
That's good.
Right here, right here.
Got that end?
Hold that steady.
Lindberg.
- Hey, who's got rope?
- Right here.
Give me something.
Yeah, good.
That work?
Do it, fellas.
Keep it coming.
USMC!
USMC!
Shit, look at that!
Jeez, look at that.
Get down!
Take cover!
Cover with that.30!
- Watch it!
Twenty yards down, Hank!
- You see them?
- I got about 20 yards, left side.
- Lindberg, get the flamethrower!
- Boots, you see them?
- Cover right!
- About 20 yards down!
Duck one!
- You see them?
Keep the cover on!
Second Squad, you see them?
Get me some grenades!
I see them!
You see them?
Right flank, over to the right!
Cover me, I'm going down!
Careful, Iggy.
Easy.
All clear!
Okay, guys, who wants to be famous?
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
- God damn it.
Strank!
- Sir?
They want a phone line run up to the top of the mountain.
Let me guess, they picked us.
Second Platoon, let's go.
Get some exercise.
Let's go!
Get off your ass.
Oh, shit!
Hope it still works, 'cause you're not getting mine!
- Get Forrestal!
- All right, then.
I don't know whose idea it was, Mr. Secretary.
Well, it was goddamn brilliant.
I want that flag, Holland.
Mark my words, raising that son-of-a-bitch means a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.
I want that flag.
Yes, sir.
I'll make sure no one touches it.
You can count on me.
Fuck that.
That flag belongs to the men in this battalion.
That son-of-a-bitch thinks that our men died taking this ground so we could hand over our flag to some politician to pin to his wall?
He's out of his goddamn mind!
Get me that flag, and find another one to replace it.
You've gotta be shitting me.
Gagnon!
Get your ass over here.
Hey.
Hi, fellas.
How's it going?
Missed a beautiful shot, Joe.
It's that kind of day.
- Hey, Mike.
- Hell of a view, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant!
Captain says he wants that flag.
He wants this flag?
Yes, sir.
- We just put the damn thing up.
- Yes, sir.
Some kind of flag shortage?
He wants you to put this one up instead.
Hey, Mike.
Do me a favor and put this up, will you?
Yes, sir.
All right, let's find a pole.
Take the flag down, boys.
Captain's orders.
You heard him, let's do it.
There you go.
Lordy, she's a heavy one.
All right, hang on.
Put this on.
One hell of a view, huh?
Good view from up here.
Yes, I'd say so myself.
All right.
- Not in your way here, am I, Joe?
- Nah, I'm fine, thanks.
Hey, Doc, you wanna give us a hand here?
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.
Ready?
Ready?
Let's go.
You get it?
I don't know.
I wish I could've seen their faces.
Nobody even noticed that second flag going up.
Everybody saw that damn picture and made up their own story about it.
But your dad and the others knew what they had done and what they had not done.
All your friends dying, it's hard not to be called a hero for saving somebody's life.
But for putting up a pole?
You gotta be kidding.
Hey!
It took a lot of talented folks a long time to make that thing.
Just wait till tonight when it's lit properly and there's thousands of cheering people in the stands.
It's gonna look a lot better.
So, stadium lights come down, spotlight comes up and you get your cue.
You charge up this thing with the flag, you plant it at the top.
You smile, you wave.
You know the drill.
You want us to plant the flag on a pile of papier-mâché.
Hey, that's show biz.
And try and stand how you stood the first time you planted it.
Just, you know, pretend the other three guys are with you.
The dead guys.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, not a problem.
Good.
But where do we imagine Hank is standing?
Sorry?
Well, seeing that he wasn't there, it'll be kind of hard for us to leave a space for him.
I think you know exactly where he was.
You pointed him out to his mother.
This is bullshit.
I planted that damn thing once, and I'm not doing it again.
- Hayes!
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
Hayes.
Hayes, get your ass back here or you're going on report.
Hayes!
You wanna do your damn job?
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Come on!
He's with me!
Hey, he's with me!
- Back off!
- Sir, he's with me.
Okay?
He's with me.
Ira, put the goddamn chair down!
- Put the chair down, son!
- Put the chair down, Ira!
Tell them drop their sticks!
Ira, they're cops, they're supposed to have nightsticks.
You're not supposed to be in the street swinging a chair.
- Calm down, son.
- Sir, turn around, please.
That poster right there?
The one on the end, that's him.
- That's him?
- Yes, sir.
You read the papers?
Christ.
We got another fucking hero.
Get him out of here.
- Can you do that?
- Yes, sir.
Put the goddamn chair down.
And let's go.
Did you start this?
He didn't serve me!
I don't make the rules.
We don't serve Indians.
He needs to go sleep it off.
Soldier Field.
You hear that?
What the hell is that?
I can't figure it out.
Keep an eye out.
It sounds like it's coming from up there.
They're using grenades.
They're killing themselves.
Ira, let's go.
Come on.
Let's go, Ira.
Come on.
Thank God.
Jesus.
Look at you, Chief.
You found him.
Holy shit.
You would have to pick today.
Vandegrift is here with enough brass to start a fucking band.
Come on, let's go.
Can you walk?
- Yes, sir.
- By yourself?
All right, look.
I don't care if you have to carry him get him to the top, plant that flag, and don't fucking fall off.
Get him in his stuff.
I'll stall these guys for as long as I can.
Hurry up.
Jesus Christ.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Cover!
Harlon!
Harlon!
Get your fire team up in that position!
O'Hare!
First Fire Team!
Work around!
BAR, you, on the side of the ridge!
Covering fire, boys, go, go, go!
Jackson, work your team around to the left!
Cover!
Left flank!
Left flank!
Franklin, Gust, go check it out!
Hustle up, boys!
We got them!
Clear!
One hell of an experience.
Move out!
Cease fire!
They're my men!
You're targeting our men!
You're targeting our...
Get me another radio!
Sergeant?
Sergeant!
Mike!
Mike, Mike, Mike.
Mike?
Mike.
Hey, where's Doc?
Corpsman!
Oh, shit.
How's his breathing?
Harlon, move, buddy.
Hey, Mike.
Mike, Mike, can you hear us?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on, Mike.
Mike?
Mike, can you hear us?
All right, let's go!
Move out!
I'm gonna get a stretcher.
Let's take him down, move him off the beach.
Ladies and gentlemen, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Corpsman!
Hank!
Hank!
Doc, they killed me.
Harlon!
Doc, they killed me.
Come on, Harlon.
Harlon, stay with me.
Franklin!
I'm fine, Ira.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Does it open?
Iggy!
Iggy!
Iggy, are you down there?
Iggy!
Can't tell who it is, but he's one of ours.
I had to go outside to throw up.
Look what they did to the poor son-of-a-bitch.
You okay, Chief?
Just let it go.
If that doesn't pry open their wallets, nothing will.
Jesus Christ, he's drunk.
Goddamn Indians.
Come on, Chief.
Let's get you home.
That's not what I hear.
I called around, I'm not stupid.
He's been drunk since he started this damn tour, making a spectacle of himself.
Just about choked that poor woman at the reception, blubbering.
Jesus Christ, you're supposed to be watching these men.
Yes, sir.
Well, he's making us look like regular asses.
Well, with all due respect, sir, he never wanted to come on this trip in the first place.
We had to pull him, kicking and screaming, off that boat.
He wants to be with his unit.
What unit?
They're all fucking dead.
This is how he honors those men?
By drinking and throwing up, and...
You know what?
He wants it, great, we'll send him back.
Get him packed and on a train today.
He's an embarrassment to the uniform.
Yes, sir.
I'll do it.
Yeah, no, that's...
That's good.
That's what I want.
I know it's a good thing, raising the money and that, 'cause we need it.
But,
I can't take them calling me a hero.
All I did was try not to get shot.
Some of the things I saw done, things I did,
they weren't things to be proud of, you know?
Mike...
Mike was a hero.
You ever meet him?
No.
Best Marine I ever met.
You know, Chief, I think if Mike was sitting here instead of you he'd be saying the same thing about himself,
not being a hero.
Maybe.
He was a good guy.
But I think that he would be ashamed of me, seeing me the way I am.
Think I could see my ma before they ship me off?
Think they'd do that?
See my ma?
I'm sorry, Ira.
We got stories now to tell our kids, I guess.
Keep your head down.
All aboard.
Good luck, Chief.
I think I saw him once after that.
It was maybe six or seven years after the war.
I was working as a salesman, doing a lot of driving.
I was driving west across Texas.
I was just trying to get where I was going so I could get home.
And I saw this guy hitchhiking on the side of the road.
And, for a second, I thought it might've been him.
I always regret that I didn't stop, but I was in a hurry.
And he was an Indian.
We always told the press that Ira insisted that he was going back to fight with his unit which was at least partially true, but
that isn't what got the headlines.
We're engaged.
Excuse me a minute, darling.
- Hey, Doc?
- Yeah?
- Got a minute?
- Yeah.
I'll see you at the car.
- You hear I'm getting married?
- I did, Rene.
That's great.
Yeah, it's something she wants.
She waited for me all this time.
She's not used to all this, but she's a good girl.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
So, I was wondering if you'd be my best man.
Me?
Don't you have somebody at home, a buddy, you'd rather ask?
Well, I didn't really make many.
The ones who didn't go, it's...
Well, it's hard to even talk to them.
You know?
Yeah, I know.
I'd be proud to.
Thank you.
I better go drag her away from them before she announces
I'm gonna be president of General Motors or something.
All right.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Rene, you're a lucky man.
- Big smile, Mrs. Gagnon!
- Say cheese!
I couldn't complain because the press loved them, so they wrote more articles and people bought more bonds.
The tour went on with just Rene and your dad.
And the true heroes are the men who didn't make it home from Iwo Jima, the men who died at Iwo Jima and in other campaigns.
We ask that you honor the memory of those men by buying the war bonds and helping us to win this war.
Thank you.
City after city, I thought the damn thing'd never end.
And this rumor kept going around that the photograph had been staged.
I remember your dad telling them that he wished he'd known he was having his picture taken because he would've ducked the hell out of it.
Whose idea was it?
Who wanted to stage the thing?
Come on, it was you?
Was there truth to the rumor that that picture was staged, Doc?
- Come on!
Doc?
- Can you answer that?
I remember when your dad got shot.
All hell was busting loose.
People back home saw that picture and thought it was over when we took Suribachi.
We wished.
Anyways, we're pinned down.
Mortars, shells, machine guns.
Fire coming from every which direction, right?
And we hear somebody call, "Corpsman down. "
Corpsman down!
Blood was spurting out of his throat, and Doc was doing everything he could.
And the Corpsman looks up at him and he knows what this means, to be shot in the neck.
He knows he's dying, you can see that.
But still in his eyes, he's pleading with Doc to save his life.
And Doc can't.
- You okay, Doc?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah, you look fine.
- I'm okay.
Keep down, all right?
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.
Okay.
Corpsman.
Corpsman!
For God sake, Corpsman!
Corpsman?
Corpsman.
Incoming!
Let me see.
It's not that bad.
You're gonna be okay.
All right?
Just stay with me.
Look at me.
Took us a half-hour to find your dad.
He could've bled to death.
Coming down.
Thanks.
Vets'll tell you about being hit but not wanting to leave their buddies.
Usually, they're lying.
You'll take any excuse to get out of there.
But it happens.
You get the feeling you're letting them down.
I could see that in your dad's face.
He wanted to go, he'd seen enough.
But he didn't want to leave us.
Now, he was a hell of a good man, your dad.
Yeah.
While we were sitting there on the beach, we heard this great roar.
And we looked up.
That was the first of thousands of landings on Iwo.
- Look at that.
- Yeah.
How about that.
I'm gonna head back, all right?
Good luck.
That island saved a lot of lives.
A lot of lives.
I don't know what else to tell you.
After the bond tour my dad finally got his operation.
By the time he got home the war was over.
First thing he did was ask my mom to marry him.
Ira tried to get on with his life and put it all behind him.
Thank you for having me here today.
It's an honor to be in front of such a strong people.
Because of the war white men will understand Indians a lot better.
And it's going to be a better world.
But life had other plans for him.
You're...
You're him, aren't you?
You're the hero, right?
Great.
All right, kids, go get your picture taken.
Oh, that's great.
That's great.
All right, now say cheese.
Cheese!
That's great!
Okay.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Thanks.
- Come on.
- That's a hero, kids.
Hero, lift this basket, will you?
It's too heavy for me.
Rene tried to take advantage of those offers he'd received on the bond tour.
Yes.
G-A-G-N-O-N.
Right.
Pronounced Rene.
Rene, yes.
- Okay, I actually called last week.
- Yes.
Okay, yes.
Mr. Gagnon.
I gave Mr. Tennack your message.
I'm sure he'll call you.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
But he was yesterday's hero.
He even applied for a job at the local police station.
They said he wasn't qualified.
After working the factory with Pauline he tried a few things but spent the rest of his life as a janitor.
But Ira...
Ira!
You got a visitor.
Ira always made the news.
I could never find out why he did it, but one day Ira just took off.
He walked and hitched over 1,300 miles from Arizona to Texas.
He found Harlon Block's father working his field.
His wife, Belle, had left him soon after they discovered Harlon died.
She never forgave him for letting her son go off to war.
And Ira told him the truth, that it had been his son who raised the flag with them, his son in the photograph.
And then he just turned and walked away.
Though the flag-raising meant nothing to him, he somehow knew it would mean everything to them.
Thanks for calling.
Just as Belle knew all along.
The press soon found out and called Hank's mom with the news that it wasn't her son after all.
The last time they all saw each other was at the unveiling of the Marine Corps War Memorial.
And even though he planted the first flag above Iwo Jima,
Hank's mother and father weren't invited.
Ira.
It's good to see you, Ira.
Hell of a statue.
It wasn't long after that that they found Ira.
The papers said he died of exposure.
There was no autopsy.
It was about that same time when my father got in his car early one morning telling my mom he had something to do.
He drove to a town on the other side of Wisconsin where Iggy's mom lived.
Ever since she heard the news about her son she'd been trying to find out how he died, and no one would tell her.
I never found out what he told her, but I can pretty much guarantee it wasn't the truth.
My mother would ask him what was troubling him.
He would never say.
And every year, as it got close to Memorial Day, the reporters would start calling asking to interview my father.
No, I'm sorry.
He's fishing in Canada.
We were always instructed to say the same thing.
Okay.
Thanks.
When Mr. McCandless retired, my father bought the funeral home where he'd worked since coming home.
He spent the rest of his life running the business and raising his family.
He never spoke about the war or about the flag-raising, never told us anything.
The first time I heard any of these stories was after he died.
Where is he?
Oh, God.
He's not here, Dad.
He died.
Who?
Who died?
Iggy.
Iggy.
Christ, poor Iggy.
I hadn't thought of him for years.
How do you know about Iggy?
You were calling for him, when you collapsed.
I wasn't looking for Iggy.
I was looking for you.
I wanted to...
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry I wasn't a better father.
Talked to you more.
I just...
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
You were the best father a man could have.
Did I ever tell you they took us swimming?
No, Dad.
After we planted the flag, we came down off the mountain and they let us swim.
It was the funniest thing.
All this fighting and we were jumping around in the water like kids.
That's the way I remember Iggy now.
I finally came to the conclusion that maybe he was right.
Maybe there's no such thing as heroes.
Maybe there are just people like my dad.
I finally came to understand why they were so uncomfortable being called heroes.
Heroes are something we create, something we need.
It's a way for us to understand what is almost incomprehensible, how people could sacrifice so much for us.
But for my dad and these men, the risks they took, the wounds they suffered, they did that for their buddies.
They may have fought for their country, but they died for their friends.
For the man in front, for the man beside them.
And if we wish to truly honor these men, we should remember them the way they really were, the way my dad remembered them.
Come on, Doc!
Corpsman!
Honey, what's wrong?
Every jackass thinks he knows what war is.
Especially those who've never been in one.
We like things nice and simple, good and evil, heroes and villains.
There's always plenty of both.
Most of the time, they are not who we think they are.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where...
Where is he?
Where is he?
Mr. Bradley?
Mr. B?
You okay?
- Where is he?
- Where is who?
Where is he?
Where did he go?
Where...
Where is he?
All right.
Just stay right here, okay?
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
It'll be okay.
Where is he?
Most guys I knew would never talk about what happened over there.
Probably 'cause they're still trying to forget about it.
They certainly didn't think of themselves as heroes.
They died without glory.
Nobody has taken their pictures.
Only their buddies knew what they did.
I'd tell their folks they died for their country.
I'm not sure that was it.
Now, there were plenty other photos taken that day, but none anybody wanted to see.
What we see and do in war, the cruelty, is unbelievable.
But somehow we gotta make some sense of it.
To do that, we need a easy to understand truth and damn few words.
Film's ruined.
I don't know.
This one looks all right.
And if you can get a picture...
Now, the right picture can win or lose a war.
You're gonna want to see this.
Look at Vietnam.
The picture of that South Vietnamese officer blowing that fella's brains out of the side of his head, whammo!
That was it.
The war was lost.
We just hung around trying to pretend it wasn't.
Took a lot of other pictures that day.
None of them made a difference.
Thanks.
Appreciate it.
Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.
Country was bankrupt.
People were becoming cynical and tired of war.
Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon!
Where?
Right there.
Planting that flag, that's your brother.
Ma, all you can see is his behind.
And that's his.
I powdered and diapered it, I know my son.
That's him.
Go get your father.
Daddy, Ma's got a picture of Harlon's keister in the paper.
You watch your mouth, young man.
Thank you.
One photo, almost all on its own, turned that around.
It's on the front page of every major paper.
Over 200 dailies and they're all flooded with requests for prints.
I think we might have found it.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- I gotta go get him.
- Oh, no, you don't.
Iggy, I gotta go.
I have a whole different theory.
He wants medical attention bad enough, he'll come to us.
Shut up and crawl over here, you lazy son-of-a-bitch!
As soon as that flare goes out.
- Crap.
Okay, well, I'll go with you.
- No.
You're actually gonna leave me here?
I'll be right back, just shoot some people.
I gotta go.
Oh, God.
Okay, it's okay.
Don't touch them.
Don't touch them.
Get your hands out of there.
Let me do that.
I'll do it, okay?
Don't look.
Keep your head back.
Keep your eyes on me.
All right, look at me.
I'll get it.
I'll take care of it.
We'll get this bandage on you.
We'll get you taken care of.
And we'll get you down to the bottom, all right?
Look, you're gonna be fine.
It's okay.
I'll do that.
I'll do that.
Here, put some pressure on that.
Put your hands on top and put some pressure on it.
Keep your head back.
Keep breathing.
Keep looking at me, all right?
Just keep looking at...
Doc.
Help me.
Help me.
All right.
Okay.
How's that feel?
- It feels good.
- It does?
All right.
- Good.
- All right.
I'm gonna go get a stretcher and get you down to the beach.
I'll be right back.
I'm all right.
Go and help someone who's hurt.
All right.
Hold on there.
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Lggy!
Lggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Lggy!
Holy shit.
They expect us to climb this?
Or something just like it.
So, where you think they're sending us?
I think it's the desert, Franklin.
Well, that makes no sense at all.
Well, it's just military psychology.
They always train you for the desert on a volcano.
Now you're just having fun with me.
Harlon, take your men right.
- Watch for Bedouins.
- Yes, sir.
- What's a Bedouin?
- It's a guy with a camel.
Well, Jeez Louise, maybe we are going to the desert.
Now, you tilt that to the right, but what if the bullet comes from the left?
Bullets don't come from the left.
You know any left-handed Japs?
That makes about as much sense as you showering with your shoes on.
You don't even know why you do it, do you?
'Cause I don't tell you mean I don't know?
You do it 'cause Mike does it.
I'll ask him.
So you cut hair back home?
Some.
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?
No, I just studied it a little.
But not in barber school?
Nope.
- Gosh.
- Let me guess, Hayes is winning.
Chief, I had very little to do with Sitting Bull's death, so maybe you could stop taking it out on me.
Different tribe.
The Pimas fought on the side of the white man.
- See, now that's smart.
- That is smart.
Yeah.
Worked real good for us.
Good luck, fellas.
Hey, good night, Lindberg.
Dead bodies.
He cuts hair on dead bodies.
What?
Even I knew that.
- Who's in?
- Oh, I'm in.
I'm in.
It must be a lot easier with them not moving around and all.
- There's that.
- Yeah.
You know what I been thinking?
Well, they been telling us we need to buddy up and I think we'd make pretty good buddies.
And how do you figure that?
Well, you know, in that we have a lot in common.
So, why do you cut dead people's hair, anyway?
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.
You tell a lot of people that?
You actually chose the Marines because they got the best uniform?
No sense being a hero if you don't look like one.
Jacks.
Queens.
Shit.
Do anything on that reservation but play cards, Chief?
All right, listen up, you sorry bunch of leathernecks!
We practice going over the side tomorrow which means we ain't long for this piece of rock.
All right!
One more thing, any man who doesn't have his masturbation papers in order better get them signed by tomorrow night or he ain't going overseas.
- I got mine already.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm square.
Wait.
Why am I just hearing about this?
That's horseshit, Franklin.
I don't have to repeat everything twice for you.
No, I didn't hear nothing about no masturbating papers.
Heard they were running short.
You know, nobody tells me nothing.
That's real nice, guys.
All right, get your ass over to the officer in charge of records.
Maybe he got some more left.
- Leave your smokes.
I'll play for you.
- Thanks, Mike.
Listen, he calls you an idiot, you take it like a man, okay?
Just do not leave without signing them.
- I appreciate it, Sergeant.
- You got it.
What the hell happened to your hair, Rene?
Look like a goddamn corpse.
Three points of contact on that rope at all times.
Next four.
Over the side.
Let's go.
Keep moving.
Next four, over the side.
Just keep your eye on the guy below you.
That's all you gotta look at.
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.
Keep three points of contact on the rope at all times.
You see?
No big thing.
Just one step at a time and keep your hands on the vertical rope.
Remember, once you're in the boat move away from the rope.
Just make sure you keep three points of contact on the rope.
I got him!
All right, get that man out of the water.
Give me a hand.
Grab his pack.
Don't worry about him, Doc.
All right, quit skylarking!
Keep it moving!
He'll be fine.
Our target, Island X, is an ugly, smelly, dirty little scab of rock called lwo Jima.
It means "Sulfur Island," which accounts for the smell.
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop, you ask me.
After 20 straight days of bombing you won't find a blade of grass or a twig on it.
It wasn't that pretty to start with.
Captain?
Lwo's just five-and-a-half miles long, two-and-a-half wide.
There's a lump down at the bottom.
That's Mount Suribachi.
On the maps in front of you the island is white.
Not much of it.
The black dots represent known enemy emplacements.
Coastal defense guns, dual-mount dual-purpose guns, covered artillery emplacements.
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes, and earth-covered structures.
I don't see any barracks or any other structures.
That's right.
And we still don't know why.
Now, this isn't just any island to them.
This isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, or Saipan.
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders in eight square miles.
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.
It's up to us to convince them.
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.
The 8th Ammo Company will land here to re-supply.
The Suribachi's guns are the biggest problem.
They can hit any point on the island.
We're sitting ducks until we take them out.
That's our job.
We cut across the island, right at the base, slit its throat, lop off its head.
And we take that mountain.
We take that mountain, we take their big guns.
We take their eyes.
Okay, I'm heading in.
Follow me.
Let's put a good show on for the Marines.
Close it up.
Take it right down to the deck.
Yeah, boys!
Man overboard portside!
See him?
Throw me a line!
He's right there.
- Where is he?
- Watch out, watch out, watch out.
Hawaii's that way!
Just keep paddling, Mac, we'll catch you on the way back!
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!
They're not gonna stop.
What?
None of them are.
They can't.
So much for "No man left behind."
- Sir.
- Come on in.
Look, I've had to make a few other changes.
I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
- You bet.
Trouble is, I already told my men I'd see them through this.
That your James Cagney impersonation?
'Cause I've heard better.
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.
Look, this isn't your first time through this.
- You don't need to prove anything.
- No, sir.
You're not the best sergeant I've ever had, you're just the best one that's still walking.
- Block's a good man.
- Yes, sir, he is.
The men know him, he can step right in.
You know, I have actually thought this through.
Platoon sergeant puts you further away from the bullets.
I already gave them my word, sir.
I told them I'd bring them all home to their mothers which means I already lied to half of them.
Can't lie to the rest.
- How are your men?
- They'll do fine.
Except maybe Gagnon.
Our own Tyrone Power?
Yes, sir.
He's a good man, just might be better use further back from the lines.
I'll use him as a runner.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
Now get out of here.
Hear the good news, Doc?
We're going in with the first waves.
Hey, you do that again I'll take your head off!
Fucking dominoes.
Iggy, have you ever heard news you considered to be bad?
The first ones off the ship, Doc.
Means we don't go over the side of the ship.
We hop on a tractor, they drive us right there.
Oh, shit, that is good news.
You see?
What'd I tell you?
What's going on?
Look at that.
We're killing them!
We're killing them, Doc.
I was promised 10 days of shelling.
You're giving me three and saying that's the best you can do?
I don't give a shit!
My men hit that beach with less than 10 and I'll be taking them home to their mamas in buckets!
Yeah, I know exactly why.
Because every Navy man with a scrambled egg on his chest wants to offload us here and sail to Japan so they can be there for the big finish, tell their kids they captured the Emperor all by themselves.
Well, you aren't going to Japan unless we take this piece of shit island!
These little pricks are dug in!
Okay, appreciate that, Jim.
Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
I'm okay.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
Jesus, Iggy, just leave me alone, all right?
How about you guys?
Knife?
Bayonet?
Kick in the ass?
How about you, Doc?
Sharpen your knife?
You sharpened it three times already.
Well, then I better make sure I didn't nick it.
Good man, Doc.
- Hey, Doc.
- Yeah.
When we land, try not to wave this kit around too much.
They got sharpshooters that are trained to look for them.
And they know that if they take out a corpsman another dozen Marines will die unattended.
All right?
Okay, Mike.
Yeah, right there.
Close the damn door.
For God's sake.
Yeah, like that's gonna help.
That your girlfriend, Chief?
Bet she's a pretty damn good-looking squaw.
Bet you're missing her, and that little wigwam of yours.
Welcome, all Marines off Iwo Jima.
We have a long-time wait...
It's what they do to prisoners,
- at least the lucky ones.
- Jesus.
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think about waving a white bandanna.
Poor Marines, so far from home for no good reason.
Think of your girls back home, waiting for you.
But a girl cannot stay home every night.
So who do you think they're with tonight?
And will she let him kiss her?
And will he comfort her at your funeral?
This sweet music is to make you think of your girls back home who are missing you.
This is all for now.
I'll see you tomorrow night.
Gunners!
Move, let's go!
Let's go, get up on the berm!
Gunners!
We're clear!
Get up the berm!
Baker Company, move out!
- Seen Second Platoon?
- I don't see them.
First Squad, move it out!
God, this place reeks.
- Go, go, go!
- Move out!
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go!
Go!
Go, go!
Drop your packs!
Go!
All clear!
- Jesus, you needed some exercise?
- He got lost.
A hundred landing craft heading for one beach and this guy gets lost.
Now I'm glad we did.
Jesus, what a mess.
Any theories why they ain't shooting?
It's getting on my nerves.
Maybe they're all dead.
What do you think, Doc?
You think they're all dead?
Mike, take six men and bring that gun onto the beach.
Second Platoon, let's move out!
Stay down.
Come on.
Move!
Move!
- Get down!
- Take cover!
Move out!
Cover fire!
Pour it on!
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!
Corpsman!
I'm gonna sling your arm and then I'll give you a shot for the pain!
Move, move!
Off the beach!
Take cover!
You got a girl back home, Marine?
We're gonna make sure she sees you, all right?
I need pressure on this wound!
Where's the fire coming from?
Where are they?
Look for a flash, shoot at it!
Let's go, let...
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!
You're over!
Third Squad, forward!
Move!
Where are they, sir?
We got ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock, pillbox!
Sergeant!
- Sergeant!
I think I can clear that out.
- What?
All right, you go.
Here.
Take these.
Check your weapon.
Yeah?
Go!
Cover!
Cover him!
Cover, cover!
Son-of-a-bitch.
Let's go!
Go!
Move it out!
Go, go, go!
Down, down, down!
It's clear.
Good work.
I thought you said it was clear!
It was!
Shit, I guess they're not in there firing at us then.
Lindberg!
Yeah!
Light it up!
I'll cover you, Ice!
Don't cover shit!
There's already enough people shooting!
One bullet and this thing goes up like a Roman candle!
Go!
Shift fire!
Shift your fire!
Go, go!
Shift your fire!
Shift your fire!
Go!
Move it out!
Hit the deck!
Stay down!
Wait for support!
Is this a bad battle or what?
It's a fucking slaughter.
Christ Jesus!
Get a machine gun team set up over here, now!
Thank God!
Tanks!
Runner!
Get those tanks up here!
Oh, shit.
Get down!
Corporal, watch your left flank!
Let's go without them!
Move out!
Move out!
Lggy, you gotta lift your side, he's gonna roll off.
Got it, Doc!
Incoming!
Move, move, move, move!
Keep moving!
Get that LVT up on the beach!
Keep moving!
You're next, pal, we're getting you out of here.
Move it!
Great news.
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa, 'cause that's where we're headed.
Not you and me.
Captain Severance asked me who else was in that picture, and Christ if I could remember, but it was Mike and Doc and Franklin and me and Hank Hansen but I just remembered, you were there, too.
I wasn't there.
'Course you were.
Neither was Hank.
He raised the first flag.
It was Harlon Block that raised that one.
Shit.
I told them it was Hank.
You weren't there, Mr. Smart Ass, how'd you know it was Harlon?
- You tell them it was me?
- No.
Like I said, I just remembered.
Good, keep your mouth shut.
They know there was somebody else, you can see it in the picture.
Then pick someone dead.
They don't want somebody dead, you dumb redskin, they want to ship us back to the States.
What did I tell you?
I wasn't there.
- You hear?
- All right.
Just settle down.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're not going anywhere.
Who the hell says?
This is horseshit.
You wounded, son?
No, sir.
Well, did you take out a nest of Japs butt-naked with your bare hands?
'Cause if I'm gonna give up my seat to a hero he better have a good goddamn story to tell.
No, sir.
Then enjoy it, 'cause they'll forget you before Christmas.
The sixth man, you got a name?
Sorry, still don't remember.
It's a damn shame, 'cause I promised the Major you'd know who it was.
Fact, you not knowing throws a doubt on you being one of the flag-raisers yourself.
Since no one wants to be embarrassed, the moment you land they'll turn you around, ship you off to Okinawa in time to meet your buddies on the beach.
So, why don't you stop screwing with me?
Give me a damn name.
Gangway!
Gangway!
Let's go, let's go!
Gangway!
Where the hell is that son-of-a-bitch?
Hayes!
Hayes?
Hayes, get your red ass over here!
Make me look like I don't know what my own men are doing with a flag the size of my mother's house?
God damn it, Ira, you shouldn't have lied to me.
You made me look like a complete asshole.
We're gonna miss you around here.
Good luck.
Now your name's in the paper, too.
Just heard your doctor say we're postponing your operation.
You're being shipped back to the mainland.
Everybody who saw that picture thought planting the flag meant victory.
That's all they wanted to know.
Victory.
Within a few weeks of that picture being taken, half the men in it were dead.
Mrs. Hansen!
Mrs. Hansen!
Did you know Hank was a hero?
- Are you proud of him, Mrs. Hansen?
- What was he like as a boy?
Look this way, please, ma'am.
What do you have to say about your son?
But somehow being a part of it meant something.
Looking at it, you could believe their sacrifice was not a waste.
Yeah, I might have thought that was Harlon, too.
It is.
Belle, their names are right here.
It's not him.
And he would be alive and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.
You think about that when you look at his picture, Ed.
And I need to rush home and change because there's the Governor's banquet and then there's the parade.
Imagine, the Governor is coming here to meet us.
Now, I'm wearing blue so, if...
- Are you going to change?
- We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin from CBS World News.
A press association has just announced that President Roosevelt is dead.
The President died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
All we know so far is that the President died at Warm Springs in Georgia.
Further updates every hour.
Temperatures will remain the same today, in the mid-30s to low 40s with clear skies.
Hello?
Yes.
Of course.
No, we understand.
It wouldn't be right.
Thank you.
Here he is, gentlemen.
Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.
Senator Haddigan.
I'd like you to meet Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Damn good to meet you.
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.
Sorry?
That's Pima Indian talk, boy, don't you know your own language?
Took forever to memorize the damn gibberish.
Sorry, I've been away from the reservation too long, Senator.
- Doc.
- Ira.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
- That's you.
- Go, go, go, go.
Go.
Please welcome
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley,
Private First Class Ira Hayes,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon!
Holy shit.
Come in, come in, come in.
Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Bud Gurber.
- You showing the boys the sights?
- We saw a hell of a ball game.
That's great.
The bar's there, help yourself.
I got some briefing sheets for you here, just some simple things we want you to say.
Mostly, "Buy bonds," can't say that too often.
Itineraries, those are changing every couple minutes.
Everybody wants to meet you guys.
I got women sending up envelopes with stockings in them, notes written in lipstick.
We won't mention that to the press, am I right?
Have a drink, for Christ's sake.
My God, what you boys must have seen over there.
I've been watching the newsreels.
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.
So, we got a hell of a lot of money to raise, not a lot of time.
White House tomorrow, then we trot you over to shake hands with a couple of hundred Congressmen who won't pull a penny out of their pockets.
Politicians and actors.
You put them in a restaurant together, they'd die of old age before picking up the check.
Then New York City, Times Square, dinners with various hoi polloi, then Chicago...
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?
That's what we're calling the mothers of the dead flag-raisers.
You present each mother with a flag, they say a few words, people will shit money.
It'll be so moving.
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.
Lovely woman.
She knows how close you and her son were.
He wrote home about you.
She is very, very much looking forward to meeting you.
Hank wasn't in the picture.
Sorry?
Hank didn't raise that flag.
He raised the other one, the real flag.
The what?
The real...
The real flag?
There's a real flag?
Yeah, ours was the replacement flag.
We put it up when they took the other one down.
Am I the only one getting a headache here?
You know about this?
It was after it was already in the papers.
The mothers had already been told, but...
That's it, that's beautiful.
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Yeah, why tell me?
I'm only the guy that has to explain it to 150 million Americans.
Who is in the goddamn picture?
Are any of you guys in the goddamn picture?
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.
Six guys raising a flag over lwo Jima.
Victory is ours.
You're three of them, right?
This was the fifth day, sir.
The battle went on for 35 more.
Well, what'd you do, raise a goddamn flag every time you stopped for lunch?
Can I hit this guy?
You know what, I don't give a shit, you're in the picture, you raised the flag, that's the story we're selling, boys.
Are you deaf?
Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?
Harlon Block.
That's whose mother should be here if anyone's should be.
You know, I think this whole damn thing is a farce, you ask me.
You know what they're calling this bond drive?
The Mighty Seventh.
They might've called it the
"We're Flat Fucking Broke And Can't Even Afford Bullets
"So We're Begging For Your Pennies" bond drive, but it didn't have quite the ring.
They could've called it that, though, because the last four bond drives came up so short we just printed money instead.
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street, he'll tell you our dollar is next to worthless, we borrowed so much.
And nobody is lending any more.
Ships aren't being built.
Tanks aren't being built.
Machine guns, bazookas, hand grenades, zip.
You think this is a farce?
You want to go back to your buddies?
Well, stuff some rocks in your pockets before you get on the plane because that's all we got left to throw at the Japanese.
And don't be surprised if your plane doesn't make it off the runway because the fuel dumps are empty.
And our good friends, the Arabs, are only taking bullion.
If we don't raise $14 billion, and that's million with a "B," this war is over by the end of the month.
We make a deal with the Japanese, we give whatever they want and we come home, because you've seen them fight, and they sure as shit ain't giving up.
$14 billion.
The last three drives didn't make that much all together.
People on the street corners, they looked at this picture and they took hope.
Don't ask me why, I think it's a crappy picture myself.
You can't even see your faces.
But it said we can win this war, are winning this war, we just need you to dig a little deeper.
They want to give us that money.
No, they want to give it to you.
But you, you don't want to ask for it.
You don't want to give them hope.
You want to explain about this person and that flag.
Well, that's your choice.
Because if we admit we made a mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about and that will be that.
Gentlemen.
Mr. President, here they are.
- Well, hello.
Good to see you.
- Mr. President.
Darn good to see you, boys.
Heard you had a hell of a fight on your hands out there, hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation in Arizona, am I right?
Yes, Mr. President.
Being an Indian, you are a truer American than any of us.
Bet your people are proud to see you wear that uniform.
Very proud, sir.
They should be.
Well, I want to thank you for coming all this way to Washington to help us out.
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific now we need you to fight for a mountain of cash.
- And I don't expect you'll let us down.
- No, sir.
Good.
Go get it.
That's the end of this ceremony.
Let's take a look at this famous photo over here, see if I can pick you out.
My gosh.
There you are.
Boys.
Boys, this one's on me.
To those who can't be with us.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon.
May we have your autograph?
I suppose.
And your name is?
I don't know about you, but I get the impression
I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.
You're such a hero.
I feel honored to be in your presence.
That's just not true.
That's professional work.
Here, to professionals.
Here they are.
You're the guys in the photograph, right?
I heard you were on the train.
Let me shake your hands, John Tennack.
John Bradley.
These boys are with me, Harvard and Yale types, didn't fight a lick.
Pappies all rich sons-of-bitches.
Boys, shake hands with some real war heroes.
Excuse me for one moment.
You can buy them a drink while you're at it.
That's right.
Drinks for these men all the way around.
And you're the other one, aren't you?
John Tennack, Tennack Homes.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Pleased to meet you.
Have a drink, come on.
And here's my card.
Listen to me, Rene, when you get finished being famous you come see me because if you can sell bonds, you can sell homes.
Now, they're not gonna build homes anymore, they're gonna deliver them.
- You heard of prefab homes?
- No, sir.
Well, you will.
And you hang on to that card and you come see me, you hear?
- All right?
- Certainly will.
All right.
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?
If Mike and the guys could see us.
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it, would they?
Harlon!
Franklin!
Can you imagine Franklin on this train
eating at the dining car with all the silver?
We shouldn't be here, Doc.
There's gonna be a Hallelujah Day
When the boys have all come home to stay
And a million bands begin to play
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
And when we've lit the torch of liberty
In each blacked-out land across the sea
Ira!
Hey, Ira!
We heard the picture was posed!
What?
We heard you posed the picture!
Hey, Doc!
We're bigger than life, Doc!
And we'll heave a mighty sigh
When each gal can kiss the boy she kissed goodbye
And they'll come marching down Fifth Avenue
The United Nations in review
When this lovely dream has all come true
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
Good job.
Thank you.
Thank you, girls!
And now, here are the men you've been waiting to meet, the men in white.
Right behind me here, the heroes of Iwo Jima,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon,
Private First Class Ira Hayes, and Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley!
Thank you.
It's good of you people to come out tonight in support of the war effort.
We really need you to buy bonds, that's for sure.
'Cause we can't win the war without your help.
As far as us being the heroes of Iwo Jima, that's just not the case.
We really didn't do much at all.
Especially him.
Especially me.
I was just a runner.
That's it.
We put up a flag.
The pole we attached it to was heavy, so it took a number of us.
We had our picture taken doing it.
The real heroes are dead on that island.
And we'd appreciate it if you bought bonds in honor of them.
Thank you.
Jump on any grenades, Ira?
Take out any machine gun nests I missed?
At least I fired my weapon.
All right, knock it off.
You hit anything or were you too drunk then, too?
What?
Guys!
Come on!
Stop it.
Knock it off.
The tall man with the high hat will be coming down your way
Get your savings out when you hear him shout
"Any bonds today?"
Any bonds today?
Bonds of freedom that's what I'm selling
Any bonds today?
Rene, right here.
Sit between these two boys.
Here comes the freedom man
Asking you to buy a share of freedom today ...for us and they need our help.
And, if you think about it, I think you'll realize that buying more bonds is not just the right thing to do but the only thing to do.
Yes, this war has gone on too long.
We have given too many lives.
And its cost...
- Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
- Strawberry.
...has been far too high.
But if we waver now, if we don't dig deep and give more than we think we can then those sacrifices would be wasted...
Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
...and those lives lost in vain.
Let's move!
Go, go!
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over.
Where the hell are our tanks?
Stuck in the sand.
Captain says you're to go without them.
Christ.
That's real good work you're doing there, Rene.
All right, prepare to move out.
Pass the word.
Second Platoon!
Move!
Move!
Move!
All right, Second Platoon, on your feet!
Let's move out!
Jackass.
Let's move out!
Go, go!
Move, move, move!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Second Platoon, move out!
Doc!
Doc, get out of there!
Corpsman!
Doc!
Doc, get the hell out of there!
May I have your attention, please.
Train number 48 with service from New York City, Boston,
Rochester, New York,
Toledo, Ohio, and South Bend, Indiana is now arriving on Track 7.
Train number 48 now arriving on Track number 7.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.
- Come on, boys.
- Let's go.
- Watch your step, ma'am.
- Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the heroes of Iwo Jima.
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.
Private First Class Ira Hayes.
And Private First Class Rene Gagnon.
Rene!
That's my boyfriend!
Who the hell is that?
I don't know.
- Rene, is that your girl?
- Hey, what do they call you?
How about a photo?
Hey, look at that!
What's your name, doll?
What's your name?
Hey, she's a beauty.
Let's go find a saloon.
Smile, boys.
Give them their money's worth.
Hey, Doc, how's the tour going for you?
Thank you.
Where exactly are you staying?
- I'm not sure yet.
- Just forget about that.
Senator, I'd like you to meet Corpsman John Bradley.
- Doc, right?
- Yes, sir.
Nice to meet you, Senator.
Good to meet you, young man.
Now, we appreciate everything you've done and everything you're doing.
- Thank you, sir.
- Quite all right.
This is Captain White.
- Colonel Johns.
- We're proud of you, Corpsman.
And then Colonel McCourtney.
- Major General Green.
- Nice to meet you.
Senator, this is Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Of course!
Now I hear you used a tomahawk on those Japs.
Is that true, Chief?
No, sir.
Well, tell them you did, makes a better story, huh?
- Attaboy.
- This is Captain Green.
John?
Madeline Evelley.
I recognize you from all the photographs.
I'm Hank's mom.
It's so nice to meet you, ma'am.
Hank was always talking about you.
This is PFC Rene Gagnon.
Pleasure to meet you, son.
Thanks for everything.
- My pleasure.
- Not at all.
Ira, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Strank, Mike's mom.
It's all right.
When I got the telegram, I...
I don't know what I'm trying to say here.
Knowing he was with you that day and seeing him in that photograph,
I don't know why it makes me feel better, but it does.
- It's so silly, isn't it?
- No, it's not.
How are you, son?
Thank you very much.
We're the largest furniture wholesaler in Illinois.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
- I'll make sure he calls.
- Well, thank you.
Thank you.
Are you Rene?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Franklin's mother.
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.
I'm Pauline, Rene's girlfriend.
Would you mind?
Paper said that's Hank, and I honestly can't tell.
It's horrible of a mother not to know her own son, isn't it?
But that's him, isn't it?
Well, to be honest, ma'am, it happened so quick, and with everything that was going on it's kind of hard to remember who was where.
But...
Yeah, I think...
I think that's where he was.
That's Hank.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Excuse us.
Take him outside.
I'm Pauline.
- Very nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
He was the best Marine I ever knew.
Thank you.
- You okay, Chief?
- Oh, Christ!
I'm okay.
Yeah, you look it.
You're gonna screw this up, aren't you?
You're gonna screw it up for all of us.
I've got him.
Get some sleep, Ira.
- Mike?
- Yeah?
- You see this?
- What?
- Mike!
- Oh, shit, go!
He's killing me!
Hey, Doc, you think they got them all?
What?
Well, they're not shooting at us.
Maybe we killed them all.
Or they ran off in the night or something.
Or they're waiting for us to start climbing.
Third Platoon!
Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.
- Just us?
- Yeah, just us, lgg.
All right, Third Platoon, move!
I tag along?
Yeah, you can lead the way if you want.
Get a good shot of my face.
It's your ass I'm gonna make famous, Hank.
Hey, that'll work for me, too.
Lieutenant, if you make it to the top, put this up.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, Iggy.
They never shoot at the first patrol.
- They don't?
- No.
They want us to go up to the top, signal to the others that it's okay, then shoot everybody else as they come up the mountain.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Unless of course they want to make an example of us and discourage all the others.
I think you're full of crap, you know that, Hank?
Really?
Jesus.
Thank God that ain't us.
Told you.
Boots, spread them out and put them on a line.
Set up a perimeter!
First Squad!
- Hank?
Find me a pole.
- Yeah.
Let's put this flag up.
Watch it.
Right over here.
Right here.
That's good.
That's good.
Right here, right here.
Got that end?
Hold that steady.
Lindberg.
- Hey, who's got rope?
- Right here.
Give me something.
Yeah, good.
That work?
Do it, fellas.
Keep it coming.
USMC!
USMC!
Shit, look at that!
Jeez, look at that.
Get down!
Take cover!
Cover with that.30!
- Watch it!
Twenty yards down, Hank!
- You see them?
- I got about 20 yards, left side.
- Lindberg, get the flamethrower!
- Boots, you see them?
- Cover right!
- About 20 yards down!
Duck one!
- You see them?
Keep the cover on!
Second Squad, you see them?
Get me some grenades!
I see them!
You see them?
Right flank, over to the right!
Cover me, I'm going down!
Careful, Iggy.
Easy.
All clear!
Okay, guys, who wants to be famous?
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
- God damn it.
Strank!
- Sir?
They want a phone line run up to the top of the mountain.
Let me guess, they picked us.
Second Platoon, let's go.
Get some exercise.
Let's go!
Get off your ass.
Oh, shit!
Hope it still works, 'cause you're not getting mine!
- Get Forrestal!
- All right, then.
I don't know whose idea it was, Mr. Secretary.
Well, it was goddamn brilliant.
I want that flag, Holland.
Mark my words, raising that son-of-a-bitch means a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.
I want that flag.
Yes, sir.
I'll make sure no one touches it.
You can count on me.
Fuck that.
That flag belongs to the men in this battalion.
That son-of-a-bitch thinks that our men died taking this ground so we could hand over our flag to some politician to pin to his wall?
He's out of his goddamn mind!
Get me that flag, and find another one to replace it.
You've gotta be shitting me.
Gagnon!
Get your ass over here.
Hey.
Hi, fellas.
How's it going?
Missed a beautiful shot, Joe.
It's that kind of day.
- Hey, Mike.
- Hell of a view, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant!
Captain says he wants that flag.
He wants this flag?
Yes, sir.
- We just put the damn thing up.
- Yes, sir.
Some kind of flag shortage?
He wants you to put this one up instead.
Hey, Mike.
Do me a favor and put this up, will you?
Yes, sir.
All right, let's find a pole.
Take the flag down, boys.
Captain's orders.
You heard him, let's do it.
There you go.
Lordy, she's a heavy one.
All right, hang on.
Put this on.
One hell of a view, huh?
Good view from up here.
Yes, I'd say so myself.
All right.
- Not in your way here, am I, Joe?
- Nah, I'm fine, thanks.
Hey, Doc, you wanna give us a hand here?
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.
Ready?
Ready?
Let's go.
You get it?
I don't know.
I wish I could've seen their faces.
Nobody even noticed that second flag going up.
Everybody saw that damn picture and made up their own story about it.
But your dad and the others knew what they had done and what they had not done.
All your friends dying, it's hard not to be called a hero for saving somebody's life.
But for putting up a pole?
You gotta be kidding.
Hey!
It took a lot of talented folks a long time to make that thing.
Just wait till tonight when it's lit properly and there's thousands of cheering people in the stands.
It's gonna look a lot better.
So, stadium lights come down, spotlight comes up and you get your cue.
You charge up this thing with the flag, you plant it at the top.
You smile, you wave.
You know the drill.
You want us to plant the flag on a pile of papier-mâché.
Hey, that's show biz.
And try and stand how you stood the first time you planted it.
Just, you know, pretend the other three guys are with you.
The dead guys.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, not a problem.
Good.
But where do we imagine Hank is standing?
Sorry?
Well, seeing that he wasn't there, it'll be kind of hard for us to leave a space for him.
I think you know exactly where he was.
You pointed him out to his mother.
This is bullshit.
I planted that damn thing once, and I'm not doing it again.
- Hayes!
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
Hayes.
Hayes, get your ass back here or you're going on report.
Hayes!
You wanna do your damn job?
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Come on!
He's with me!
Hey, he's with me!
- Back off!
- Sir, he's with me.
Okay?
He's with me.
Ira, put the goddamn chair down!
- Put the chair down, son!
- Put the chair down, Ira!
Tell them drop their sticks!
Ira, they're cops, they're supposed to have nightsticks.
You're not supposed to be in the street swinging a chair.
- Calm down, son.
- Sir, turn around, please.
That poster right there?
The one on the end, that's him.
- That's him?
- Yes, sir.
You read the papers?
Christ.
We got another fucking hero.
Get him out of here.
- Can you do that?
- Yes, sir.
Put the goddamn chair down.
And let's go.
Did you start this?
He didn't serve me!
I don't make the rules.
We don't serve Indians.
He needs to go sleep it off.
Soldier Field.
You hear that?
What the hell is that?
I can't figure it out.
Keep an eye out.
It sounds like it's coming from up there.
They're using grenades.
They're killing themselves.
Ira, let's go.
Come on.
Let's go, Ira.
Come on.
Thank God.
Jesus.
Look at you, Chief.
You found him.
Holy shit.
You would have to pick today.
Vandegrift is here with enough brass to start a fucking band.
Come on, let's go.
Can you walk?
- Yes, sir.
- By yourself?
All right, look.
I don't care if you have to carry him get him to the top, plant that flag, and don't fucking fall off.
Get him in his stuff.
I'll stall these guys for as long as I can.
Hurry up.
Jesus Christ.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Cover!
Harlon!
Harlon!
Get your fire team up in that position!
O'Hare!
First Fire Team!
Work around!
BAR, you, on the side of the ridge!
Covering fire, boys, go, go, go!
Jackson, work your team around to the left!
Cover!
Left flank!
Left flank!
Franklin, Gust, go check it out!
Hustle up, boys!
We got them!
Clear!
One hell of an experience.
Move out!
Cease fire!
They're my men!
You're targeting our men!
You're targeting our...
Get me another radio!
Sergeant?
Sergeant!
Mike!
Mike, Mike, Mike.
Mike?
Mike.
Hey, where's Doc?
Corpsman!
Oh, shit.
How's his breathing?
Harlon, move, buddy.
Hey, Mike.
Mike, Mike, can you hear us?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on, Mike.
Mike?
Mike, can you hear us?
All right, let's go!
Move out!
I'm gonna get a stretcher.
Let's take him down, move him off the beach.
Ladies and gentlemen, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Corpsman!
Hank!
Hank!
Doc, they killed me.
Harlon!
Doc, they killed me.
Come on, Harlon.
Harlon, stay with me.
Franklin!
I'm fine, Ira.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Lggy!
Lggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Lggy!
Does it open?
Lggy!
Lggy!
Lggy, are you down there?
Lggy!
Can't tell who it is, but he's one of ours.
I had to go outside to throw up.
Look what they did to the poor son-of-a-bitch.
You okay, Chief?
Just let it go.
If that doesn't pry open their wallets, nothing will.
Jesus Christ, he's drunk.
Goddamn Indians.
Come on, Chief.
Let's get you home.
That's not what I hear.
I called around, I'm not stupid.
He's been drunk since he started this damn tour, making a spectacle of himself.
Just about choked that poor woman at the reception, blubbering.
Jesus Christ, you're supposed to be watching these men.
Yes, sir.
Well, he's making us look like regular asses.
Well, with all due respect, sir, he never wanted to come on this trip in the first place.
We had to pull him, kicking and screaming, off that boat.
He wants to be with his unit.
What unit?
They're all fucking dead.
This is how he honors those men?
By drinking and throwing up, and...
You know what?
He wants it, great, we'll send him back.
Get him packed and on a train today.
He's an embarrassment to the uniform.
Yes, sir.
I'll do it.
Yeah, no, that's...
That's good.
That's what I want.
I know it's a good thing, raising the money and that, 'cause we need it.
But,
I can't take them calling me a hero.
All I did was try not to get shot.
Some of the things I saw done, things I did,
they weren't things to be proud of, you know?
Mike...
Mike was a hero.
You ever meet him?
No.
Best Marine I ever met.
You know, Chief, I think if Mike was sitting here instead of you he'd be saying the same thing about himself,
not being a hero.
Maybe.
He was a good guy.
But I think that he would be ashamed of me, seeing me the way I am.
Think I could see my ma before they ship me off?
Think they'd do that?
See my ma?
I'm sorry, Ira.
We got stories now to tell our kids, I guess.
Keep your head down.
All aboard.
Good luck, Chief.
I think I saw him once after that.
It was maybe six or seven years after the war.
I was working as a salesman, doing a lot of driving.
I was driving west across Texas.
I was just trying to get where I was going so I could get home.
And I saw this guy hitchhiking on the side of the road.
And, for a second, I thought it might've been him.
I always regret that I didn't stop, but I was in a hurry.
And he was an Indian.
We always told the press that Ira insisted that he was going back to fight with his unit which was at least partially true, but
that isn't what got the headlines.
We're engaged.
Excuse me a minute, darling.
- Hey, Doc?
- Yeah?
- Got a minute?
- Yeah.
I'll see you at the car.
- You hear I'm getting married?
- I did, Rene.
That's great.
Yeah, it's something she wants.
She waited for me all this time.
She's not used to all this, but she's a good girl.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
So, I was wondering if you'd be my best man.
Me?
Don't you have somebody at home, a buddy, you'd rather ask?
Well, I didn't really make many.
The ones who didn't go, it's...
Well, it's hard to even talk to them.
You know?
Yeah, I know.
I'd be proud to.
Thank you.
I better go drag her away from them before she announces
I'm gonna be president of General Motors or something.
All right.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Rene, you're a lucky man.
- Big smile, Mrs. Gagnon!
- Say cheese!
I couldn't complain because the press loved them, so they wrote more articles and people bought more bonds.
The tour went on with just Rene and your dad.
And the true heroes are the men who didn't make it home from lwo Jima, the men who died at Iwo Jima and in other campaigns.
We ask that you honor the memory of those men by buying the war bonds and helping us to win this war.
Thank you.
City after city, I thought the damn thing'd never end.
And this rumor kept going around that the photograph had been staged.
I remember your dad telling them that he wished he'd known he was having his picture taken because he would've ducked the hell out of it.
Whose idea was it?
Who wanted to stage the thing?
Come on, it was you?
Was there truth to the rumor that that picture was staged, Doc?
- Come on!
Doc?
- Can you answer that?
I remember when your dad got shot.
All hell was busting loose.
People back home saw that picture and thought it was over when we took Suribachi.
We wished.
Anyways, we're pinned down.
Mortars, shells, machine guns.
Fire coming from every which direction, right?
And we hear somebody call, "Corpsman down."
Corpsman down!
Blood was spurting out of his throat, and Doc was doing everything he could.
And the Corpsman looks up at him and he knows what this means, to be shot in the neck.
He knows he's dying, you can see that.
But still in his eyes, he's pleading with Doc to save his life.
And Doc can't.
- You okay, Doc?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah, you look fine.
- I'm okay.
Keep down, all right?
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.
Okay.
Corpsman.
Corpsman!
For God sake, Corpsman!
Corpsman?
Corpsman.
Incoming!
Let me see.
It's not that bad.
You're gonna be okay.
All right?
Just stay with me.
Look at me.
Took us a half-hour to find your dad.
He could've bled to death.
Coming down.
Thanks.
Vets'll tell you about being hit but not wanting to leave their buddies.
Usually, they're lying.
You'll take any excuse to get out of there.
But it happens.
You get the feeling you're letting them down.
I could see that in your dad's face.
He wanted to go, he'd seen enough.
But he didn't want to leave us.
Now, he was a hell of a good man, your dad.
Yeah.
While we were sitting there on the beach, we heard this great roar.
And we looked up.
That was the first of thousands of landings on Iwo.
- Look at that.
- Yeah.
How about that.
I'm gonna head back, all right?
Good luck.
That island saved a lot of lives.
A lot of lives.
I don't know what else to tell you.
After the bond tour my dad finally got his operation.
By the time he got home the war was over.
First thing he did was ask my mom to marry him.
Ira tried to get on with his life and put it all behind him.
Thank you for having me here today.
It's an honor to be in front of such a strong people.
Because of the war white men will understand Indians a lot better.
And it's going to be a better world.
But life had other plans for him.
You're...
You're him, aren't you?
You're the hero, right?
Great.
All right, kids, go get your picture taken.
Oh, that's great.
That's great.
All right, now say cheese.
Cheese!
That's great!
Okay.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Thanks.
- Come on.
- That's a hero, kids.
Hero, lift this basket, will you?
It's too heavy for me.
Rene tried to take advantage of those offers he'd received on the bond tour.
Yes.
G-A-G-N-O-N.
Right.
Pronounced Rene.
Rene, yes.
- Okay, I actually called last week.
- Yes.
Okay, yes.
Mr. Gagnon.
I gave Mr. Tennack your message.
I'm sure he'll call you.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
But he was yesterday's hero.
He even applied for a job at the local police station.
They said he wasn't qualified.
After working the factory with Pauline he tried a few things but spent the rest of his life as a janitor.
But Ira...
Ira!
You got a visitor.
Ira always made the news.
I could never find out why he did it, but one day Ira just took off.
He walked and hitched over 1,300 miles from Arizona to Texas.
He found Harlon Block's father working his field.
His wife, Belle, had left him soon after they discovered Harlon died.
She never forgave him for letting her son go off to war.
And Ira told him the truth, that it had been his son who raised the flag with them, his son in the photograph.
And then he just turned and walked away.
Though the flag-raising meant nothing to him, he somehow knew it would mean everything to them.
Thanks for calling.
Just as Belle knew all along.
The press soon found out and called Hank's mom with the news that it wasn't her son after all.
The last time they all saw each other was at the unveiling of the Marine Corps War Memorial.
And even though he planted the first flag above lwo Jima,
Hank's mother and father weren't invited.
Ira.
It's good to see you, Ira.
Hell of a statue.
It wasn't long after that that they found Ira.
The papers said he died of exposure.
There was no autopsy.
It was about that same time when my father got in his car early one morning telling my mom he had something to do.
He drove to a town on the other side of Wisconsin where Iggy's mom lived.
Ever since she heard the news about her son she'd been trying to find out how he died, and no one would tell her.
I never found out what he told her, but I can pretty much guarantee it wasn't the truth.
My mother would ask him what was troubling him.
He would never say.
And every year, as it got close to Memorial Day, the reporters would start calling asking to interview my father.
No, I'm sorry.
He's fishing in Canada.
We were always instructed to say the same thing.
Okay.
Thanks.
When Mr. McCandless retired, my father bought the funeral home where he'd worked since coming home.
He spent the rest of his life running the business and raising his family.
He never spoke about the war or about the flag-raising, never told us anything.
The first time I heard any of these stories was after he died.
Where is he?
Oh, God.
He's not here, Dad.
He died.
Who?
Who died?
Lggy.
Iggy.
Christ, poor lggy.
I hadn't thought of him for years.
How do you know about Iggy?
You were calling for him, when you collapsed.
I wasn't looking for Iggy.
I was looking for you.
I wanted to...
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry I wasn't a better father.
Talked to you more.
I just...
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
You were the best father a man could have.
Did I ever tell you they took us swimming?
No, Dad.
After we planted the flag, we came down off the mountain and they let us swim.
It was the funniest thing.
All this fighting and we were jumping around in the water like kids.
That's the way I remember lggy now.
I finally came to the conclusion that maybe he was right.
Maybe there's no such thing as heroes.
Maybe there are just people like my dad.
I finally came to understand why they were so uncomfortable being called heroes.
Heroes are something we create, something we need.
It's a way for us to understand what is almost incomprehensible, how people could sacrifice so much for us.
But for my dad and these men, the risks they took, the wounds they suffered, they did that for their buddies.
They may have fought for their country, but they died for their friends.
For the man in front, for the man beside them.
And if we wish to truly honor these men, we should remember them the way they really were, the way my dad remembered them.
Come on, Doc!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
For God sakes!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Honey, what's wrong?
Every jackass thinks he knows what war is.
Especially those who've never been in one.
We like things nice and simple, good and evil, heroes and villains.
There's always plenty of both.
Most of the time, they are not who we think they are.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where...
Where is he?
Where is he?
Mr. Bradley?
Mr. B?
You okay?
- Where is he?
- Where is who?
Where is he?
Where did he go?
Where...
Where is he?
All right.
Just stay right here, okay?
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
It'll be okay.
Where is he?
Most guys I knew would never talk about what happened over there.
Probably 'cause they're still trying to forget about it.
They certainly didn't think of themselves as heroes.
They died without glory.
Nobody has taken their pictures.
Only their buddies knew what they did.
I'd tell their folks they died for their country.
I'm not sure that was it.
Now, there were plenty other photos taken that day, but none anybody wanted to see.
What we see and do in war, the cruelty, is unbelievable.
But somehow we gotta make some sense of it.
To do that, we need a easy to understand truth and damn few words.
Film's ruined.
I don't know.
This one looks all right.
And if you can get a picture...
Now, the right picture can win or lose a war.
You're gonna want to see this.
Look at Vietnam.
The picture of that South Vietnamese officer blowing that fella's brains out of the side of his head, whammo!
That was it.
The war was lost.
We just hung around trying to pretend it wasn't.
Took a lot of other pictures that day.
None of them made a difference.
Thanks.
Appreciate it.
Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.
Country was bankrupt.
People were becoming cynical and tired of war.
Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon!
Where?
Right there.
Planting that flag, that's your brother.
Ma, all you can see is his behind.
And that's his.
I powdered and diapered it, I know my son.
That's him.
Go get your father.
Daddy, Ma's got a picture of Harlon's keister in the paper.
You watch your mouth, young man.
Thank you.
One photo, almost all on its own, turned that around.
It's on the front page of every major paper.
Over 200 dailies and they're all flooded with requests for prints.
I think we might have found it.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- I gotta go get him.
- Oh, no, you don't.
Iggy, I gotta go.
I have a whole different theory.
He wants medical attention bad enough, he'll come to us.
Shut up and crawl over here, you lazy son-of-a-bitch!
As soon as that flare goes out.
- Crap.
Okay, well, I'll go with you.
- No.
You're actually gonna leave me here?
I'll be right back, just shoot some people.
I gotta go.
Oh, God.
Okay, it's okay.
Don't touch them.
Don't touch them.
Get your hands out of there.
Let me do that.
I'll do it, okay?
Don't look.
Keep your head back.
Keep your eyes on me.
All right, look at me.
I'll get it.
I'll take care of it.
We'll get this bandage on you.
We'll get you taken care of.
And we'll get you down to the bottom, all right?
Look, you're gonna be fine.
It's okay.
I'll do that.
I'll do that.
Here, put some pressure on that.
Put your hands on top and put some pressure on it.
Keep your head back.
Keep breathing.
Keep looking at me, all right?
Just keep looking at...
Doc.
Help me.
Help me.
All right.
Okay.
How's that feel?
- It feels good.
- It does?
All right.
- Good.
- All right.
I'm gonna go get a stretcher and get you down to the beach.
I'll be right back.
I'm all right.
Go and help someone who's hurt.
All right.
Hold on there.
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Lggy!
Lggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Lggy!
Holy shit.
They expect us to climb this?
Or something just like it.
So, where you think they're sending us?
I think it's the desert, Franklin.
Well, that makes no sense at all.
Well, it's just military psychology.
They always train you for the desert on a volcano.
Now you're just having fun with me.
Harlon, take your men right.
- Watch for Bedouins.
- Yes, sir.
- What's a Bedouin?
- It's a guy with a camel.
Well, Jeez Louise, maybe we are going to the desert.
Now, you tilt that to the right, but what if the bullet comes from the left?
Bullets don't come from the left.
You know any left-handed Japs?
That makes about as much sense as you showering with your shoes on.
You don't even know why you do it, do you?
'Cause I don't tell you mean I don't know?
You do it 'cause Mike does it.
I'll ask him.
So you cut hair back home?
Some.
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?
No, I just studied it a little.
But not in barber school?
Nope.
- Gosh.
- Let me guess, Hayes is winning.
Chief, I had very little to do with Sitting Bull's death, so maybe you could stop taking it out on me.
Different tribe.
The Pimas fought on the side of the white man.
- See, now that's smart.
- That is smart.
Yeah.
Worked real good for us.
Good luck, fellas.
Hey, good night, Lindberg.
Dead bodies.
He cuts hair on dead bodies.
What?
Even I knew that.
- Who's in?
- Oh, I'm in.
I'm in.
It must be a lot easier with them not moving around and all.
- There's that.
- Yeah.
You know what I been thinking?
Well, they been telling us we need to buddy up and I think we'd make pretty good buddies.
And how do you figure that?
Well, you know, in that we have a lot in common.
So, why do you cut dead people's hair, anyway?
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.
You tell a lot of people that?
You actually chose the Marines because they got the best uniform?
No sense being a hero if you don't look like one.
Jacks.
Queens.
Shit.
Do anything on that reservation but play cards, Chief?
All right, listen up, you sorry bunch of leathernecks!
We practice going over the side tomorrow which means we ain't long for this piece of rock.
All right!
One more thing, any man who doesn't have his masturbation papers in order better get them signed by tomorrow night or he ain't going overseas.
- I got mine already.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm square.
Wait.
Why am I just hearing about this?
That's horseshit, Franklin.
I don't have to repeat everything twice for you.
No, I didn't hear nothing about no masturbating papers.
Heard they were running short.
You know, nobody tells me nothing.
That's real nice, guys.
All right, get your ass over to the officer in charge of records.
Maybe he got some more left.
- Leave your smokes.
I'll play for you.
- Thanks, Mike.
Listen, he calls you an idiot, you take it like a man, okay?
Just do not leave without signing them.
- I appreciate it, Sergeant.
- You got it.
What the hell happened to your hair, Rene?
Look like a goddamn corpse.
Three points of contact on that rope at all times.
Next four.
Over the side.
Let's go.
Keep moving.
Next four, over the side.
Just keep your eye on the guy below you.
That's all you gotta look at.
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.
Keep three points of contact on the rope at all times.
You see?
No big thing.
Just one step at a time and keep your hands on the vertical rope.
Remember, once you're in the boat move away from the rope.
Just make sure you keep three points of contact on the rope.
I got him!
All right, get that man out of the water.
Give me a hand.
Grab his pack.
Don't worry about him, Doc.
All right, quit skylarking!
Keep it moving!
He'll be fine.
Our target, Island X, is an ugly, smelly, dirty little scab of rock called lwo Jima.
It means "Sulfur Island," which accounts for the smell.
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop, you ask me.
After 20 straight days of bombing you won't find a blade of grass or a twig on it.
It wasn't that pretty to start with.
Captain?
Lwo's just five-and-a-half miles long, two-and-a-half wide.
There's a lump down at the bottom.
That's Mount Suribachi.
On the maps in front of you the island is white.
Not much of it.
The black dots represent known enemy emplacements.
Coastal defense guns, dual-mount dual-purpose guns, covered artillery emplacements.
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes, and earth-covered structures.
I don't see any barracks or any other structures.
That's right.
And we still don't know why.
Now, this isn't just any island to them.
This isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, or Saipan.
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders in eight square miles.
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.
It's up to us to convince them.
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.
The 8th Ammo Company will land here to re-supply.
The Suribachi's guns are the biggest problem.
They can hit any point on the island.
We're sitting ducks until we take them out.
That's our job.
We cut across the island, right at the base, slit its throat, lop off its head.
And we take that mountain.
We take that mountain, we take their big guns.
We take their eyes.
Okay, I'm heading in.
Follow me.
Let's put a good show on for the Marines.
Close it up.
Take it right down to the deck.
Yeah, boys!
Man overboard portside!
See him?
Throw me a line!
He's right there.
- Where is he?
- Watch out, watch out, watch out.
Hawaii's that way!
Just keep paddling, Mac, we'll catch you on the way back!
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!
They're not gonna stop.
What?
None of them are.
They can't.
So much for "No man left behind."
- Sir.
- Come on in.
Look, I've had to make a few other changes.
I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
- You bet.
Trouble is, I already told my men I'd see them through this.
That your James Cagney impersonation?
'Cause I've heard better.
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.
Look, this isn't your first time through this.
- You don't need to prove anything.
- No, sir.
You're not the best sergeant I've ever had, you're just the best one that's still walking.
- Block's a good man.
- Yes, sir, he is.
The men know him, he can step right in.
You know, I have actually thought this through.
Platoon sergeant puts you further away from the bullets.
I already gave them my word, sir.
I told them I'd bring them all home to their mothers which means I already lied to half of them.
Can't lie to the rest.
- How are your men?
- They'll do fine.
Except maybe Gagnon.
Our own Tyrone Power?
Yes, sir.
He's a good man, just might be better use further back from the lines.
I'll use him as a runner.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
Now get out of here.
Hear the good news, Doc?
We're going in with the first waves.
Hey, you do that again I'll take your head off!
Fucking dominoes.
Iggy, have you ever heard news you considered to be bad?
The first ones off the ship, Doc.
Means we don't go over the side of the ship.
We hop on a tractor, they drive us right there.
Oh, shit, that is good news.
You see?
What'd I tell you?
What's going on?
Look at that.
We're killing them!
We're killing them, Doc.
I was promised 10 days of shelling.
You're giving me three and saying that's the best you can do?
I don't give a shit!
My men hit that beach with less than 10 and I'll be taking them home to their mamas in buckets!
Yeah, I know exactly why.
Because every Navy man with a scrambled egg on his chest wants to offload us here and sail to Japan so they can be there for the big finish, tell their kids they captured the Emperor all by themselves.
Well, you aren't going to Japan unless we take this piece of shit island!
These little pricks are dug in!
Okay, appreciate that, Jim.
Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
I'm okay.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
Jesus, Iggy, just leave me alone, all right?
How about you guys?
Knife?
Bayonet?
Kick in the ass?
How about you, Doc?
Sharpen your knife?
You sharpened it three times already.
Well, then I better make sure I didn't nick it.
Good man, Doc.
- Hey, Doc.
- Yeah.
When we land, try not to wave this kit around too much.
They got sharpshooters that are trained to look for them.
And they know that if they take out a corpsman another dozen Marines will die unattended.
All right?
Okay, Mike.
Yeah, right there.
Close the damn door.
For God's sake.
Yeah, like that's gonna help.
That your girlfriend, Chief?
Bet she's a pretty damn good-looking squaw.
Bet you're missing her, and that little wigwam of yours.
Welcome, all Marines off Iwo Jima.
We have a long-time wait...
It's what they do to prisoners,
- at least the lucky ones.
- Jesus.
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think about waving a white bandanna.
Poor Marines, so far from home for no good reason.
Think of your girls back home, waiting for you.
But a girl cannot stay home every night.
So who do you think they're with tonight?
And will she let him kiss her?
And will he comfort her at your funeral?
This sweet music is to make you think of your girls back home who are missing you.
This is all for now.
I'll see you tomorrow night.
Gunners!
Move, let's go!
Let's go, get up on the berm!
Gunners!
We're clear!
Get up the berm!
Baker Company, move out!
- Seen Second Platoon?
- I don't see them.
First Squad, move it out!
God, this place reeks.
- Go, go, go!
- Move out!
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go!
Go!
Go, go!
Drop your packs!
Go!
All clear!
- Jesus, you needed some exercise?
- He got lost.
A hundred landing craft heading for one beach and this guy gets lost.
Now I'm glad we did.
Jesus, what a mess.
Any theories why they ain't shooting?
It's getting on my nerves.
Maybe they're all dead.
What do you think, Doc?
You think they're all dead?
Mike, take six men and bring that gun onto the beach.
Second Platoon, let's move out!
Stay down.
Come on.
Move!
Move!
- Get down!
- Take cover!
Move out!
Cover fire!
Pour it on!
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!
Corpsman!
I'm gonna sling your arm and then I'll give you a shot for the pain!
Move, move!
Off the beach!
Take cover!
You got a girl back home, Marine?
We're gonna make sure she sees you, all right?
I need pressure on this wound!
Where's the fire coming from?
Where are they?
Look for a flash, shoot at it!
Let's go, let...
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!
You're over!
Third Squad, forward!
Move!
Where are they, sir?
We got ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock, pillbox!
Sergeant!
- Sergeant!
I think I can clear that out.
- What?
All right, you go.
Here.
Take these.
Check your weapon.
Yeah?
Go!
Cover!
Cover him!
Cover, cover!
Son-of-a-bitch.
Let's go!
Go!
Move it out!
Go, go, go!
Down, down, down!
It's clear.
Good work.
I thought you said it was clear!
It was!
Shit, I guess they're not in there firing at us then.
Lindberg!
Yeah!
Light it up!
I'll cover you, Ice!
Don't cover shit!
There's already enough people shooting!
One bullet and this thing goes up like a Roman candle!
Go!
Shift fire!
Shift your fire!
Go, go!
Shift your fire!
Shift your fire!
Go!
Move it out!
Hit the deck!
Stay down!
Wait for support!
Is this a bad battle or what?
It's a fucking slaughter.
Christ Jesus!
Get a machine gun team set up over here, now!
Thank God!
Tanks!
Runner!
Get those tanks up here!
Oh, shit.
Get down!
Corporal, watch your left flank!
Let's go without them!
Move out!
Move out!
Lggy, you gotta lift your side, he's gonna roll off.
Got it, Doc!
Incoming!
Move, move, move, move!
Keep moving!
Get that LVT up on the beach!
Keep moving!
You're next, pal, we're getting you out of here.
Move it!
Great news.
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa, 'cause that's where we're headed.
Not you and me.
Captain Severance asked me who else was in that picture, and Christ if I could remember, but it was Mike and Doc and Franklin and me and Hank Hansen but I just remembered, you were there, too.
I wasn't there.
'Course you were.
Neither was Hank.
He raised the first flag.
It was Harlon Block that raised that one.
Shit.
I told them it was Hank.
You weren't there, Mr. Smart Ass, how'd you know it was Harlon?
- You tell them it was me?
- No.
Like I said, I just remembered.
Good, keep your mouth shut.
They know there was somebody else, you can see it in the picture.
Then pick someone dead.
They don't want somebody dead, you dumb redskin, they want to ship us back to the States.
What did I tell you?
I wasn't there.
- You hear?
- All right.
Just settle down.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're not going anywhere.
Who the hell says?
This is horseshit.
You wounded, son?
No, sir.
Well, did you take out a nest of Japs butt-naked with your bare hands?
'Cause if I'm gonna give up my seat to a hero he better have a good goddamn story to tell.
No, sir.
Then enjoy it, 'cause they'll forget you before Christmas.
The sixth man, you got a name?
Sorry, still don't remember.
It's a damn shame, 'cause I promised the Major you'd know who it was.
Fact, you not knowing throws a doubt on you being one of the flag-raisers yourself.
Since no one wants to be embarrassed, the moment you land they'll turn you around, ship you off to Okinawa in time to meet your buddies on the beach.
So, why don't you stop screwing with me?
Give me a damn name.
Gangway!
Gangway!
Let's go, let's go!
Gangway!
Where the hell is that son-of-a-bitch?
Hayes!
Hayes?
Hayes, get your red ass over here!
Make me look like I don't know what my own men are doing with a flag the size of my mother's house?
God damn it, Ira, you shouldn't have lied to me.
You made me look like a complete asshole.
We're gonna miss you around here.
Good luck.
Now your name's in the paper, too.
Just heard your doctor say we're postponing your operation.
You're being shipped back to the mainland.
Everybody who saw that picture thought planting the flag meant victory.
That's all they wanted to know.
Victory.
Within a few weeks of that picture being taken, half the men in it were dead.
Mrs. Hansen!
Mrs. Hansen!
Did you know Hank was a hero?
- Are you proud of him, Mrs. Hansen?
- What was he like as a boy?
Look this way, please, ma'am.
What do you have to say about your son?
But somehow being a part of it meant something.
Looking at it, you could believe their sacrifice was not a waste.
Yeah, I might have thought that was Harlon, too.
It is.
Belle, their names are right here.
It's not him.
And he would be alive and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.
You think about that when you look at his picture, Ed.
And I need to rush home and change because there's the Governor's banquet and then there's the parade.
Imagine, the Governor is coming here to meet us.
Now, I'm wearing blue so, if...
- Are you going to change?
- We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin from CBS World News.
A press association has just announced that President Roosevelt is dead.
The President died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
All we know so far is that the President died at Warm Springs in Georgia.
Further updates every hour.
Temperatures will remain the same today, in the mid-30s to low 40s with clear skies.
Hello?
Yes.
Of course.
No, we understand.
It wouldn't be right.
Thank you.
Here he is, gentlemen.
Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.
Senator Haddigan.
I'd like you to meet Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Damn good to meet you.
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.
Sorry?
That's Pima Indian talk, boy, don't you know your own language?
Took forever to memorize the damn gibberish.
Sorry, I've been away from the reservation too long, Senator.
- Doc.
- Ira.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
- That's you.
- Go, go, go, go.
Go.
Please welcome
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley,
Private First Class Ira Hayes,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon!
Holy shit.
Come in, come in, come in.
Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Bud Gurber.
- You showing the boys the sights?
- We saw a hell of a ball game.
That's great.
The bar's there, help yourself.
I got some briefing sheets for you here, just some simple things we want you to say.
Mostly, "Buy bonds," can't say that too often.
Itineraries, those are changing every couple minutes.
Everybody wants to meet you guys.
I got women sending up envelopes with stockings in them, notes written in lipstick.
We won't mention that to the press, am I right?
Have a drink, for Christ's sake.
My God, what you boys must have seen over there.
I've been watching the newsreels.
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.
So, we got a hell of a lot of money to raise, not a lot of time.
White House tomorrow, then we trot you over to shake hands with a couple of hundred Congressmen who won't pull a penny out of their pockets.
Politicians and actors.
You put them in a restaurant together, they'd die of old age before picking up the check.
Then New York City, Times Square, dinners with various hoi polloi, then Chicago...
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?
That's what we're calling the mothers of the dead flag-raisers.
You present each mother with a flag, they say a few words, people will shit money.
It'll be so moving.
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.
Lovely woman.
She knows how close you and her son were.
He wrote home about you.
She is very, very much looking forward to meeting you.
Hank wasn't in the picture.
Sorry?
Hank didn't raise that flag.
He raised the other one, the real flag.
The what?
The real...
The real flag?
There's a real flag?
Yeah, ours was the replacement flag.
We put it up when they took the other one down.
Am I the only one getting a headache here?
You know about this?
It was after it was already in the papers.
The mothers had already been told, but...
That's it, that's beautiful.
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Yeah, why tell me?
I'm only the guy that has to explain it to 150 million Americans.
Who is in the goddamn picture?
Are any of you guys in the goddamn picture?
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.
Six guys raising a flag over lwo Jima.
Victory is ours.
You're three of them, right?
This was the fifth day, sir.
The battle went on for 35 more.
Well, what'd you do, raise a goddamn flag every time you stopped for lunch?
Can I hit this guy?
You know what, I don't give a shit, you're in the picture, you raised the flag, that's the story we're selling, boys.
Are you deaf?
Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?
Harlon Block.
That's whose mother should be here if anyone's should be.
You know, I think this whole damn thing is a farce, you ask me.
You know what they're calling this bond drive?
The Mighty Seventh.
They might've called it the
"We're Flat Fucking Broke And Can't Even Afford Bullets
"So We're Begging For Your Pennies" bond drive, but it didn't have quite the ring.
They could've called it that, though, because the last four bond drives came up so short we just printed money instead.
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street, he'll tell you our dollar is next to worthless, we borrowed so much.
And nobody is lending any more.
Ships aren't being built.
Tanks aren't being built.
Machine guns, bazookas, hand grenades, zip.
You think this is a farce?
You want to go back to your buddies?
Well, stuff some rocks in your pockets before you get on the plane because that's all we got left to throw at the Japanese.
And don't be surprised if your plane doesn't make it off the runway because the fuel dumps are empty.
And our good friends, the Arabs, are only taking bullion.
If we don't raise $14 billion, and that's million with a "B," this war is over by the end of the month.
We make a deal with the Japanese, we give whatever they want and we come home, because you've seen them fight, and they sure as shit ain't giving up.
$14 billion.
The last three drives didn't make that much all together.
People on the street corners, they looked at this picture and they took hope.
Don't ask me why, I think it's a crappy picture myself.
You can't even see your faces.
But it said we can win this war, are winning this war, we just need you to dig a little deeper.
They want to give us that money.
No, they want to give it to you.
But you, you don't want to ask for it.
You don't want to give them hope.
You want to explain about this person and that flag.
Well, that's your choice.
Because if we admit we made a mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about and that will be that.
Gentlemen.
Mr. President, here they are.
- Well, hello.
Good to see you.
- Mr. President.
Darn good to see you, boys.
Heard you had a hell of a fight on your hands out there, hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation in Arizona, am I right?
Yes, Mr. President.
Being an Indian, you are a truer American than any of us.
Bet your people are proud to see you wear that uniform.
Very proud, sir.
They should be.
Well, I want to thank you for coming all this way to Washington to help us out.
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific now we need you to fight for a mountain of cash.
- And I don't expect you'll let us down.
- No, sir.
Good.
Go get it.
That's the end of this ceremony.
Let's take a look at this famous photo over here, see if I can pick you out.
My gosh.
There you are.
Boys.
Boys, this one's on me.
To those who can't be with us.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon.
May we have your autograph?
I suppose.
And your name is?
I don't know about you, but I get the impression
I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.
You're such a hero.
I feel honored to be in your presence.
That's just not true.
That's professional work.
Here, to professionals.
Here they are.
You're the guys in the photograph, right?
I heard you were on the train.
Let me shake your hands, John Tennack.
John Bradley.
These boys are with me, Harvard and Yale types, didn't fight a lick.
Pappies all rich sons-of-bitches.
Boys, shake hands with some real war heroes.
Excuse me for one moment.
You can buy them a drink while you're at it.
That's right.
Drinks for these men all the way around.
And you're the other one, aren't you?
John Tennack, Tennack Homes.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Pleased to meet you.
Have a drink, come on.
And here's my card.
Listen to me, Rene, when you get finished being famous you come see me because if you can sell bonds, you can sell homes.
Now, they're not gonna build homes anymore, they're gonna deliver them.
- You heard of prefab homes?
- No, sir.
Well, you will.
And you hang on to that card and you come see me, you hear?
- All right?
- Certainly will.
All right.
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?
If Mike and the guys could see us.
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it, would they?
Harlon!
Franklin!
Can you imagine Franklin on this train
eating at the dining car with all the silver?
We shouldn't be here, Doc.
There's gonna be a Hallelujah Day
When the boys have all come home to stay
And a million bands begin to play
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
And when we've lit the torch of liberty
In each blacked-out land across the sea
Ira!
Hey, Ira!
We heard the picture was posed!
What?
We heard you posed the picture!
Hey, Doc!
We're bigger than life, Doc!
And we'll heave a mighty sigh
When each gal can kiss the boy she kissed goodbye
And they'll come marching down Fifth Avenue
The United Nations in review
When this lovely dream has all come true
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
Good job.
Thank you.
Thank you, girls!
And now, here are the men you've been waiting to meet, the men in white.
Right behind me here, the heroes of Iwo Jima,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon,
Private First Class Ira Hayes, and Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley!
Thank you.
It's good of you people to come out tonight in support of the war effort.
We really need you to buy bonds, that's for sure.
'Cause we can't win the war without your help.
As far as us being the heroes of Iwo Jima, that's just not the case.
We really didn't do much at all.
Especially him.
Especially me.
I was just a runner.
That's it.
We put up a flag.
The pole we attached it to was heavy, so it took a number of us.
We had our picture taken doing it.
The real heroes are dead on that island.
And we'd appreciate it if you bought bonds in honor of them.
Thank you.
Jump on any grenades, Ira?
Take out any machine gun nests I missed?
At least I fired my weapon.
All right, knock it off.
You hit anything or were you too drunk then, too?
What?
Guys!
Come on!
Stop it.
Knock it off.
The tall man with the high hat will be coming down your way
Get your savings out when you hear him shout
"Any bonds today?"
Any bonds today?
Bonds of freedom that's what I'm selling
Any bonds today?
Rene, right here.
Sit between these two boys.
Here comes the freedom man
Asking you to buy a share of freedom today ...for us and they need our help.
And, if you think about it, I think you'll realize that buying more bonds is not just the right thing to do but the only thing to do.
Yes, this war has gone on too long.
We have given too many lives.
And its cost...
- Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
- Strawberry.
...has been far too high.
But if we waver now, if we don't dig deep and give more than we think we can then those sacrifices would be wasted...
Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
...and those lives lost in vain.
Let's move!
Go, go!
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over.
Where the hell are our tanks?
Stuck in the sand.
Captain says you're to go without them.
Christ.
That's real good work you're doing there, Rene.
All right, prepare to move out.
Pass the word.
Second Platoon!
Move!
Move!
Move!
All right, Second Platoon, on your feet!
Let's move out!
Jackass.
Let's move out!
Go, go!
Move, move, move!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Second Platoon, move out!
Doc!
Doc, get out of there!
Corpsman!
Doc!
Doc, get the hell out of there!
May I have your attention, please.
Train number 48 with service from New York City, Boston,
Rochester, New York,
Toledo, Ohio, and South Bend, Indiana is now arriving on Track 7.
Train number 48 now arriving on Track number 7.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.
- Come on, boys.
- Let's go.
- Watch your step, ma'am.
- Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the heroes of Iwo Jima.
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.
Private First Class Ira Hayes.
And Private First Class Rene Gagnon.
Rene!
That's my boyfriend!
Who the hell is that?
I don't know.
- Rene, is that your girl?
- Hey, what do they call you?
How about a photo?
Hey, look at that!
What's your name, doll?
What's your name?
Hey, she's a beauty.
Let's go find a saloon.
Smile, boys.
Give them their money's worth.
Hey, Doc, how's the tour going for you?
Thank you.
Where exactly are you staying?
- I'm not sure yet.
- Just forget about that.
Senator, I'd like you to meet Corpsman John Bradley.
- Doc, right?
- Yes, sir.
Nice to meet you, Senator.
Good to meet you, young man.
Now, we appreciate everything you've done and everything you're doing.
- Thank you, sir.
- Quite all right.
This is Captain White.
- Colonel Johns.
- We're proud of you, Corpsman.
And then Colonel McCourtney.
- Major General Green.
- Nice to meet you.
Senator, this is Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Of course!
Now I hear you used a tomahawk on those Japs.
Is that true, Chief?
No, sir.
Well, tell them you did, makes a better story, huh?
- Attaboy.
- This is Captain Green.
John?
Madeline Evelley.
I recognize you from all the photographs.
I'm Hank's mom.
It's so nice to meet you, ma'am.
Hank was always talking about you.
This is PFC Rene Gagnon.
Pleasure to meet you, son.
Thanks for everything.
- My pleasure.
- Not at all.
Ira, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Strank, Mike's mom.
It's all right.
When I got the telegram, I...
I don't know what I'm trying to say here.
Knowing he was with you that day and seeing him in that photograph,
I don't know why it makes me feel better, but it does.
- It's so silly, isn't it?
- No, it's not.
How are you, son?
Thank you very much.
We're the largest furniture wholesaler in Illinois.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
- I'll make sure he calls.
- Well, thank you.
Thank you.
Are you Rene?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Franklin's mother.
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.
I'm Pauline, Rene's girlfriend.
Would you mind?
Paper said that's Hank, and I honestly can't tell.
It's horrible of a mother not to know her own son, isn't it?
But that's him, isn't it?
Well, to be honest, ma'am, it happened so quick, and with everything that was going on it's kind of hard to remember who was where.
But...
Yeah, I think...
I think that's where he was.
That's Hank.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Excuse us.
Take him outside.
I'm Pauline.
- Very nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
He was the best Marine I ever knew.
Thank you.
- You okay, Chief?
- Oh, Christ!
I'm okay.
Yeah, you look it.
You're gonna screw this up, aren't you?
You're gonna screw it up for all of us.
I've got him.
Get some sleep, Ira.
- Mike?
- Yeah?
- You see this?
- What?
- Mike!
- Oh, shit, go!
He's killing me!
Hey, Doc, you think they got them all?
What?
Well, they're not shooting at us.
Maybe we killed them all.
Or they ran off in the night or something.
Or they're waiting for us to start climbing.
Third Platoon!
Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.
- Just us?
- Yeah, just us, lgg.
All right, Third Platoon, move!
I tag along?
Yeah, you can lead the way if you want.
Get a good shot of my face.
It's your ass I'm gonna make famous, Hank.
Hey, that'll work for me, too.
Lieutenant, if you make it to the top, put this up.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, Iggy.
They never shoot at the first patrol.
- They don't?
- No.
They want us to go up to the top, signal to the others that it's okay, then shoot everybody else as they come up the mountain.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Unless of course they want to make an example of us and discourage all the others.
I think you're full of crap, you know that, Hank?
Really?
Jesus.
Thank God that ain't us.
Told you.
Boots, spread them out and put them on a line.
Set up a perimeter!
First Squad!
- Hank?
Find me a pole.
- Yeah.
Let's put this flag up.
Watch it.
Right over here.
Right here.
That's good.
That's good.
Right here, right here.
Got that end?
Hold that steady.
Lindberg.
- Hey, who's got rope?
- Right here.
Give me something.
Yeah, good.
That work?
Do it, fellas.
Keep it coming.
USMC!
USMC!
Shit, look at that!
Jeez, look at that.
Get down!
Take cover!
Cover with that.30!
- Watch it!
Twenty yards down, Hank!
- You see them?
- I got about 20 yards, left side.
- Lindberg, get the flamethrower!
- Boots, you see them?
- Cover right!
- About 20 yards down!
Duck one!
- You see them?
Keep the cover on!
Second Squad, you see them?
Get me some grenades!
I see them!
You see them?
Right flank, over to the right!
Cover me, I'm going down!
Careful, Iggy.
Easy.
All clear!
Okay, guys, who wants to be famous?
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
- God damn it.
Strank!
- Sir?
They want a phone line run up to the top of the mountain.
Let me guess, they picked us.
Second Platoon, let's go.
Get some exercise.
Let's go!
Get off your ass.
Oh, shit!
Hope it still works, 'cause you're not getting mine!
- Get Forrestal!
- All right, then.
I don't know whose idea it was, Mr. Secretary.
Well, it was goddamn brilliant.
I want that flag, Holland.
Mark my words, raising that son-of-a-bitch means a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.
I want that flag.
Yes, sir.
I'll make sure no one touches it.
You can count on me.
Fuck that.
That flag belongs to the men in this battalion.
That son-of-a-bitch thinks that our men died taking this ground so we could hand over our flag to some politician to pin to his wall?
He's out of his goddamn mind!
Get me that flag, and find another one to replace it.
You've gotta be shitting me.
Gagnon!
Get your ass over here.
Hey.
Hi, fellas.
How's it going?
Missed a beautiful shot, Joe.
It's that kind of day.
- Hey, Mike.
- Hell of a view, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant!
Captain says he wants that flag.
He wants this flag?
Yes, sir.
- We just put the damn thing up.
- Yes, sir.
Some kind of flag shortage?
He wants you to put this one up instead.
Hey, Mike.
Do me a favor and put this up, will you?
Yes, sir.
All right, let's find a pole.
Take the flag down, boys.
Captain's orders.
You heard him, let's do it.
There you go.
Lordy, she's a heavy one.
All right, hang on.
Put this on.
One hell of a view, huh?
Good view from up here.
Yes, I'd say so myself.
All right.
- Not in your way here, am I, Joe?
- Nah, I'm fine, thanks.
Hey, Doc, you wanna give us a hand here?
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.
Ready?
Ready?
Let's go.
You get it?
I don't know.
I wish I could've seen their faces.
Nobody even noticed that second flag going up.
Everybody saw that damn picture and made up their own story about it.
But your dad and the others knew what they had done and what they had not done.
All your friends dying, it's hard not to be called a hero for saving somebody's life.
But for putting up a pole?
You gotta be kidding.
Hey!
It took a lot of talented folks a long time to make that thing.
Just wait till tonight when it's lit properly and there's thousands of cheering people in the stands.
It's gonna look a lot better.
So, stadium lights come down, spotlight comes up and you get your cue.
You charge up this thing with the flag, you plant it at the top.
You smile, you wave.
You know the drill.
You want us to plant the flag on a pile of papier-mache.
Hey, that's show biz.
And try and stand how you stood the first time you planted it.
Just, you know, pretend the other three guys are with you.
The dead guys.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, not a problem.
Good.
But where do we imagine Hank is standing?
Sorry?
Well, seeing that he wasn't there, it'll be kind of hard for us to leave a space for him.
I think you know exactly where he was.
You pointed him out to his mother.
This is bullshit.
I planted that damn thing once, and I'm not doing it again.
- Hayes!
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
Hayes.
Hayes, get your ass back here or you're going on report.
Hayes!
You wanna do your damn job?
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Come on!
He's with me!
Hey, he's with me!
- Back off!
- Sir, he's with me.
Okay?
He's with me.
Ira, put the goddamn chair down!
- Put the chair down, son!
- Put the chair down, Ira!
Tell them drop their sticks!
Ira, they're cops, they're supposed to have nightsticks.
You're not supposed to be in the street swinging a chair.
- Calm down, son.
- Sir, turn around, please.
That poster right there?
The one on the end, that's him.
- That's him?
- Yes, sir.
You read the papers?
Christ.
We got another fucking hero.
Get him out of here.
- Can you do that?
- Yes, sir.
Put the goddamn chair down.
And let's go.
Did you start this?
He didn't serve me!
I don't make the rules.
We don't serve Indians.
He needs to go sleep it off.
Soldier Field.
You hear that?
What the hell is that?
I can't figure it out.
Keep an eye out.
It sounds like it's coming from up there.
They're using grenades.
They're killing themselves.
Ira, let's go.
Come on.
Let's go, Ira.
Come on.
Thank God.
Jesus.
Look at you, Chief.
You found him.
Holy shit.
You would have to pick today.
Vandegrift is here with enough brass to start a fucking band.
Come on, let's go.
Can you walk?
- Yes, sir.
- By yourself?
All right, look.
I don't care if you have to carry him get him to the top, plant that flag, and don't fucking fall off.
Get him in his stuff.
I'll stall these guys for as long as I can.
Hurry up.
Jesus Christ.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Cover!
Harlon!
Harlon!
Get your fire team up in that position!
O'Hare!
First Fire Team!
Work around!
BAR, you, on the side of the ridge!
Covering fire, boys, go, go, go!
Jackson, work your team around to the left!
Cover!
Left flank!
Left flank!
Franklin, Gust, go check it out!
Hustle up, boys!
We got them!
Clear!
One hell of an experience.
Move out!
Cease fire!
They're my men!
You're targeting our men!
You're targeting our...
Get me another radio!
Sergeant?
Sergeant!
Mike!
Mike, Mike, Mike.
Mike?
Mike.
Hey, where's Doc?
Corpsman!
Oh, shit.
How's his breathing?
Harlon, move, buddy.
Hey, Mike.
Mike, Mike, can you hear us?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on, Mike.
Mike?
Mike, can you hear us?
All right, let's go!
Move out!
I'm gonna get a stretcher.
Let's take him down, move him off the beach.
Ladies and gentlemen, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Corpsman!
Hank!
Hank!
Doc, they killed me.
Harlon!
Doc, they killed me.
Come on, Harlon.
Harlon, stay with me.
Franklin!
I'm fine, Ira.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Lggy!
Lggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Lggy!
Does it open?
Lggy!
Lggy!
Lggy, are you down there?
Lggy!
Can't tell who it is, but he's one of ours.
I had to go outside to throw up.
Look what they did to the poor son-of-a-bitch.
You okay, Chief?
Just let it go.
If that doesn't pry open their wallets, nothing will.
Jesus Christ, he's drunk.
Goddamn Indians.
Come on, Chief.
Let's get you home.
That's not what I hear.
I called around, I'm not stupid.
He's been drunk since he started this damn tour, making a spectacle of himself.
Just about choked that poor woman at the reception, blubbering.
Jesus Christ, you're supposed to be watching these men.
Yes, sir.
Well, he's making us look like regular asses.
Well, with all due respect, sir, he never wanted to come on this trip in the first place.
We had to pull him, kicking and screaming, off that boat.
He wants to be with his unit.
What unit?
They're all fucking dead.
This is how he honors those men?
By drinking and throwing up, and...
You know what?
He wants it, great, we'll send him back.
Get him packed and on a train today.
He's an embarrassment to the uniform.
Yes, sir.
I'll do it.
Yeah, no, that's...
That's good.
That's what I want.
I know it's a good thing, raising the money and that, 'cause we need it.
But,
I can't take them calling me a hero.
All I did was try not to get shot.
Some of the things I saw done, things I did,
they weren't things to be proud of, you know?
Mike...
Mike was a hero.
You ever meet him?
No.
Best Marine I ever met.
You know, Chief, I think if Mike was sitting here instead of you he'd be saying the same thing about himself,
not being a hero.
Maybe.
He was a good guy.
But I think that he would be ashamed of me, seeing me the way I am.
Think I could see my ma before they ship me off?
Think they'd do that?
See my ma?
I'm sorry, Ira.
We got stories now to tell our kids, I guess.
Keep your head down.
All aboard.
Good luck, Chief.
I think I saw him once after that.
It was maybe six or seven years after the war.
I was working as a salesman, doing a lot of driving.
I was driving west across Texas.
I was just trying to get where I was going so I could get home.
And I saw this guy hitchhiking on the side of the road.
And, for a second, I thought it might've been him.
I always regret that I didn't stop, but I was in a hurry.
And he was an Indian.
We always told the press that Ira insisted that he was going back to fight with his unit which was at least partially true, but
that isn't what got the headlines.
We're engaged.
Excuse me a minute, darling.
- Hey, Doc?
- Yeah?
- Got a minute?
- Yeah.
I'll see you at the car.
- You hear I'm getting married?
- I did, Rene.
That's great.
Yeah, it's something she wants.
She waited for me all this time.
She's not used to all this, but she's a good girl.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
So, I was wondering if you'd be my best man.
Me?
Don't you have somebody at home, a buddy, you'd rather ask?
Well, I didn't really make many.
The ones who didn't go, it's...
Well, it's hard to even talk to them.
You know?
Yeah, I know.
I'd be proud to.
Thank you.
I better go drag her away from them before she announces
I'm gonna be president of General Motors or something.
All right.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Rene, you're a lucky man.
- Big smile, Mrs. Gagnon!
- Say cheese!
I couldn't complain because the press loved them, so they wrote more articles and people bought more bonds.
The tour went on with just Rene and your dad.
And the true heroes are the men who didn't make it home from lwo Jima, the men who died at Iwo Jima and in other campaigns.
We ask that you honor the memory of those men by buying the war bonds and helping us to win this war.
Thank you.
City after city, I thought the damn thing'd never end.
And this rumor kept going around that the photograph had been staged.
I remember your dad telling them that he wished he'd known he was having his picture taken because he would've ducked the hell out of it.
Whose idea was it?
Who wanted to stage the thing?
Come on, it was you?
Was there truth to the rumor that that picture was staged, Doc?
- Come on!
Doc?
- Can you answer that?
I remember when your dad got shot.
All hell was busting loose.
People back home saw that picture and thought it was over when we took Suribachi.
We wished.
Anyways, we're pinned down.
Mortars, shells, machine guns.
Fire coming from every which direction, right?
And we hear somebody call, "Corpsman down."
Corpsman down!
Blood was spurting out of his throat, and Doc was doing everything he could.
And the Corpsman looks up at him and he knows what this means, to be shot in the neck.
He knows he's dying, you can see that.
But still in his eyes, he's pleading with Doc to save his life.
And Doc can't.
- You okay, Doc?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah, you look fine.
- I'm okay.
Keep down, all right?
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.
Okay.
Corpsman.
Corpsman!
For God sake, Corpsman!
Corpsman?
Corpsman.
Incoming!
Let me see.
It's not that bad.
You're gonna be okay.
All right?
Just stay with me.
Look at me.
Took us a half-hour to find your dad.
He could've bled to death.
Coming down.
Thanks.
Vets'll tell you about being hit but not wanting to leave their buddies.
Usually, they're lying.
You'll take any excuse to get out of there.
But it happens.
You get the feeling you're letting them down.
I could see that in your dad's face.
He wanted to go, he'd seen enough.
But he didn't want to leave us.
Now, he was a hell of a good man, your dad.
Yeah.
While we were sitting there on the beach, we heard this great roar.
And we looked up.
That was the first of thousands of landings on Iwo.
- Look at that.
- Yeah.
How about that.
I'm gonna head back, all right?
Good luck.
That island saved a lot of lives.
A lot of lives.
I don't know what else to tell you.
After the bond tour my dad finally got his operation.
By the time he got home the war was over.
First thing he did was ask my mom to marry him.
Ira tried to get on with his life and put it all behind him.
Thank you for having me here today.
It's an honor to be in front of such a strong people.
Because of the war white men will understand Indians a lot better.
And it's going to be a better world.
But life had other plans for him.
You're...
You're him, aren't you?
You're the hero, right?
Great.
All right, kids, go get your picture taken.
Oh, that's great.
That's great.
All right, now say cheese.
Cheese!
That's great!
Okay.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Thanks.
- Come on.
- That's a hero, kids.
Hero, lift this basket, will you?
It's too heavy for me.
Rene tried to take advantage of those offers he'd received on the bond tour.
Yes.
G-A-G-N-O-N.
Right.
Pronounced Rene.
Rene, yes.
- Okay, I actually called last week.
- Yes.
Okay, yes.
Mr. Gagnon.
I gave Mr. Tennack your message.
I'm sure he'll call you.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
But he was yesterday's hero.
He even applied for a job at the local police station.
They said he wasn't qualified.
After working the factory with Pauline he tried a few things but spent the rest of his life as a janitor.
But Ira...
Ira!
You got a visitor.
Ira always made the news.
I could never find out why he did it, but one day Ira just took off.
He walked and hitched over 1,300 miles from Arizona to Texas.
He found Harlon Block's father working his field.
His wife, Belle, had left him soon after they discovered Harlon died.
She never forgave him for letting her son go off to war.
And Ira told him the truth, that it had been his son who raised the flag with them, his son in the photograph.
And then he just turned and walked away.
Though the flag-raising meant nothing to him, he somehow knew it would mean everything to them.
Thanks for calling.
Just as Belle knew all along.
The press soon found out and called Hank's mom with the news that it wasn't her son after all.
The last time they all saw each other was at the unveiling of the Marine Corps War Memorial.
And even though he planted the first flag above lwo Jima,
Hank's mother and father weren't invited.
Ira.
It's good to see you, Ira.
Hell of a statue.
It wasn't long after that that they found Ira.
The papers said he died of exposure.
There was no autopsy.
It was about that same time when my father got in his car early one morning telling my mom he had something to do.
He drove to a town on the other side of Wisconsin where Iggy's mom lived.
Ever since she heard the news about her son she'd been trying to find out how he died, and no one would tell her.
I never found out what he told her, but I can pretty much guarantee it wasn't the truth.
My mother would ask him what was troubling him.
He would never say.
And every year, as it got close to Memorial Day, the reporters would start calling asking to interview my father.
No, I'm sorry.
He's fishing in Canada.
We were always instructed to say the same thing.
Okay.
Thanks.
When Mr. McCandless retired, my father bought the funeral home where he'd worked since coming home.
He spent the rest of his life running the business and raising his family.
He never spoke about the war or about the flag-raising, never told us anything.
The first time I heard any of these stories was after he died.
Where is he?
Oh, God.
He's not here, Dad.
He died.
Who?
Who died?
Lggy.
Iggy.
Christ, poor lggy.
I hadn't thought of him for years.
How do you know about Iggy?
You were calling for him, when you collapsed.
I wasn't looking for Iggy.
I was looking for you.
I wanted to...
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry I wasn't a better father.
Talked to you more.
I just...
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
You were the best father a man could have.
Did I ever tell you they took us swimming?
No, Dad.
After we planted the flag, we came down off the mountain and they let us swim.
It was the funniest thing.
All this fighting and we were jumping around in the water like kids.
That's the way I remember lggy now.
I finally came to the conclusion that maybe he was right.
Maybe there's no such thing as heroes.
Maybe there are just people like my dad.
I finally came to understand why they were so uncomfortable being called heroes.
Heroes are something we create, something we need.
It's a way for us to understand what is almost incomprehensible, how people could sacrifice so much for us.
But for my dad and these men, the risks they took, the wounds they suffered, they did that for their buddies.
They may have fought for their country, but they died for their friends.
For the man in front, for the man beside them.
And if we wish to truly honor these men, we should remember them the way they really were, the way my dad remembered them.
Come on, Doc!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
For God sakes!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Honey, what's wrong?
Every jackass thinks he knows what war is.
Especially those who've never been in one.
We like things nice and simple, good and evil, heroes and villains.
There's always plenty of both.
Most of the time, they are not who we think they are.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where...
Where is he?
Where is he?
Mr. Bradley?
Mr. B?
You okay?
- Where is he?
- Where is who?
Where is he?
Where did he go?
Where...
Where is he?
All right.
Just stay right here, okay?
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
It'll be okay.
Where is he?
Most guys I knew would never talk about what happened over there.
Probably 'cause they're still trying to forget about it.
They certainly didn't think of themselves as heroes.
They died without glory.
Nobody has taken their pictures.
Only their buddies knew what they did.
I'd tell their folks they died for their country.
I'm not sure that was it.
Now, there were plenty other photos taken that day, but none anybody wanted to see.
What we see and do in war, the cruelty, is unbelievable.
But somehow we gotta make some sense of it.
To do that, we need a easy to understand truth and damn few words.
Film's ruined.
I don't know.
This one looks all right.
And if you can get a picture...
Now, the right picture can win or lose a war.
You're gonna want to see this.
Look at Vietnam.
The picture of that South Vietnamese officer blowing that fella's brains out of the side of his head, whammo!
That was it.
The war was lost.
We just hung around trying to pretend it wasn't.
Took a lot of other pictures that day.
None of them made a difference.
Thanks.
Appreciate it.
Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.
Country was bankrupt.
People were becoming cynical and tired of war.
Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon!
Where?
Right there.
Planting that flag, that's your brother.
Ma, all you can see is his behind.
And that's his.
I powdered and diapered it, I know my son.
That's him.
Go get your father.
Daddy, Ma's got a picture of Harlon's keister in the paper.
You watch your mouth, young man.
Thank you.
One photo, almost all on its own, turned that around.
It's on the front page of every major paper.
Over 200 dailies and they're all flooded with requests for prints.
I think we might have found it.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- I gotta go get him.
- Oh, no, you don't.
Iggy, I gotta go.
I have a whole different theory.
He wants medical attention bad enough, he'll come to us.
Shut up and crawl over here, you lazy son- of- a- bitch!
As soon as that flare goes out.
- Crap.
Okay, well, I'll go with you.
- No.
You're actually gonna leave me here?
I'll be right back, just shoot some people.
I gotta go.
Oh, God.
Okay, it's okay.
Don't touch them.
Don't touch them.
Get your hands out of there.
Let me do that.
I'll do it, okay?
Don't look.
Keep your head back.
Keep your eyes on me.
All right, look at me.
I'll get it.
I'll take care of it.
We'll get this bandage on you.
We'll get you taken care of.
And we'll get you down to the bottom, all right?
Look, you're gonna be fine.
It's okay.
I'll do that.
I'll do that.
Here, put some pressure on that.
Put your hands on top and put some pressure on it.
Keep your head back.
Keep breathing.
Keep looking at me, all right?
Just keep looking at...
Doc.
Help me.
Help me.
All right.
Okay.
How's that feel?
- It feels good.
- It does?
All right.
- Good.
- All right.
I'm gonna go get a stretcher and get you down to the beach.
I'll be right back.
I'm all right.
Go and help someone who's hurt.
All right.
Hold on there.
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Holy shit.
They expect us to climb this?
Or something just like it.
So, where you think they're sending us?
I think it's the desert, Franklin.
Well, that makes no sense at all.
Well, it's just military psychology.
They always train you for the desert on a volcano.
Now you're just having fun with me.
Harlon, take your men right.
- Watch for Bedouins.
- Yes, sir.
- What's a Bedouin?
- It's a guy with a camel.
Well, Jeez Louise, maybe we are going to the desert.
Now, you tilt that to the right, but what if the bullet comes from the left?
Bullets don't come from the left.
You know any left- handed Japs?
That makes about as much sense as you showering with your shoes on.
You don't even know why you do it, do you?
'Cause I don't tell you mean I don't know?
You do it 'cause Mike does it.
I'll ask him.
So you cut hair back home?
Some.
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?
No, I just studied it a little.
But not in barber school?
Nope.
- Gosh.
- Let me guess, Hayes is winning.
Chief, I had very little to do with Sitting Bull's death, so maybe you could stop taking it out on me.
Different tribe.
The Pimas fought on the side of the white man.
- See, now that's smart.
- That is smart.
Yeah.
Worked real good for us.
Good luck, fellas.
Hey, good night, Lindberg.
Dead bodies.
He cuts hair on dead bodies.
What?
Even I knew that.
- Who's in?
- Oh, I'm in.
I'm in.
It must be a lot easier with them not moving around and all.
- There's that.
- Yeah.
You know what I been thinking?
Well, they been telling us we need to buddy up and I think we'd make pretty good buddies.
And how do you figure that?
Well, you know, in that we have a lot in common.
So, why do you cut dead people's hair, anyway?
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.
You tell a lot of people that?
You actually chose the Marines because they got the best uniform?
No sense being a hero if you don't look like one.
Jacks.
Queens.
Shit.
Do anything on that reservation but play cards, Chief?
All right, listen up, you sorry bunch of leathernecks!
We practice going over the side tomorrow which means we ain't long for this piece of rock.
All right!
One more thing, any man who doesn't have his masturbation papers in order better get them signed by tomorrow night or he ain't going overseas.
- I got mine already.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm square.
Wait.
Why am I just hearing about this?
That's horseshit, Franklin.
I don't have to repeat everything twice for you.
No, I didn't hear nothing about no masturbating papers.
Heard they were running short.
You know, nobody tells me nothing.
That's real nice, guys.
All right, get your ass over to the officer in charge of records.
Maybe he got some more left.
- Leave your smokes.
I'll play for you.
- Thanks, Mike.
Listen, he calls you an idiot, you take it like a man, okay?
Just do not leave without signing them.
- I appreciate it, Sergeant.
- You got it.
What the hell happened to your hair, Rene?
Look like a goddamn corpse.
Three points of contact on that rope at all times.
Next four.
Over the side.
Let's go.
Keep moving.
Next four, over the side.
Just keep your eye on the guy below you.
That's all you gotta look at.
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.
Keep three points of contact on the rope at all times.
You see?
No big thing.
Just one step at a time and keep your hands on the vertical rope.
Remember, once you're in the boat move away from the rope.
Just make sure you keep three points of contact on the rope.
I got him!
All right, get that man out of the water.
Give me a hand.
Grab his pack.
Don't worry about him, Doc.
All right, quit skylarking!
Keep it moving!
He'll be fine.
Our target, Island X, is an ugly, smelly, dirty little scab of rock called lwo Jima.
It means "Sulfur Island," which accounts for the smell.
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop, you ask me.
After 20 straight days of bombing you won't find a blade of grass or a twig on it.
It wasn't that pretty to start with.
Captain?
Iwo's just five-and-a-half miles long, two-and-a-half wide.
There's a lump down at the bottom.
That's Mount Suribachi.
On the maps in front of you the island is white.
Not much of it.
The black dots represent known enemy emplacements.
Coastal defense guns, dual-mount dual-purpose guns, covered artillery emplacements.
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes, and earth- covered structures.
I don't see any barracks or any other structures.
That's right.
And we still don't know why.
Now, this isn't just any island to them.
This isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, or Saipan.
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders in eight square miles.
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.
It's up to us to convince them.
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.
The 8th Ammo Company will land here to re- supply.
The Suribachi's guns are the biggest problem.
They can hit any point on the island.
We're sitting ducks until we take them out.
That's our job.
We cut across the island, right at the base, slit its throat, lop off its head.
And we take that mountain.
We take that mountain, we take their big guns.
We take their eyes.
Okay, I'm heading in.
Follow me.
Let's put a good show on for the Marines.
Close it up.
Take it right down to the deck.
Yeah, boys!
Man overboard portside!
See him?
Throw me a line!
He's right there.
- Where is he?
- Watch out, watch out, watch out.
Hawaii's that way!
Just keep paddling, Mac, we'll catch you on the way back!
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!
They're not gonna stop.
What?
None of them are.
They can't.
So much for "No man left behind."
- Sir.
- Come on in.
Look, I've had to make a few other changes.
I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
- You bet.
Trouble is, I already told my men I'd see them through this.
That your James Cagney impersonation?
'Cause I've heard better.
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.
Look, this isn't your first time through this.
- You don't need to prove anything.
- No, sir.
You're not the best sergeant I've ever had, you're just the best one that's still walking.
- Block's a good man.
- Yes, sir, he is.
The men know him, he can step right in.
You know, I have actually thought this through.
Platoon sergeant puts you further away from the bullets.
I already gave them my word, sir.
I told them I'd bring them all home to their mothers which means I already lied to half of them.
Can't lie to the rest.
- How are your men?
- They'll do fine.
Except maybe Gagnon.
Our own Tyrone Power?
Yes, sir.
He's a good man, just might be better use further back from the lines.
I'll use him as a runner.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
Now get out of here.
Hear the good news, Doc?
We're going in with the first waves.
Hey, you do that again I'll take your head off!
Fucking dominoes.
Iggy, have you ever heard news you considered to be bad?
The first ones off the ship, Doc.
Means we don't go over the side of the ship.
We hop on a tractor, they drive us right there.
Oh, shit, that is good news.
You see?
What'd I tell you?
What's going on?
Look at that.
We're killing them!
We're killing them, Doc.
I was promised 10 days of shelling.
You're giving me three and saying that's the best you can do?
I don't give a shit!
My men hit that beach with less than 10 and I'll be taking them home to their mamas in buckets!
Yeah, I know exactly why.
Because every Navy man with a scrambled egg on his chest wants to offload us here and sail to Japan so they can be there for the big finish, tell their kids they captured the Emperor all by themselves.
Well, you aren't going to Japan unless we take this piece of shit island!
These little pricks are dug in!
Okay, appreciate that, Jim.
Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
I'm okay.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
Jesus, Iggy, just leave me alone, all right?
How about you guys?
Knife?
Bayonet?
Kick in the ass?
How about you, Doc?
Sharpen your knife?
You sharpened it three times already.
Well, then I better make sure I didn't nick it.
Good man, Doc.
- Hey, Doc.
- Yeah.
When we land, try not to wave this kit around too much.
They got sharpshooters that are trained to look for them.
And they know that if they take out a corpsman another dozen Marines will die unattended.
All right?
Okay, Mike.
Yeah, right there.
Close the damn door.
For God's sake.
Yeah, like that's gonna help.
That your girlfriend, Chief?
Bet she's a pretty damn good- looking squaw.
Bet you're missing her, and that little wigwam of yours.
Welcome, all Marines off Iwo Jima.
We have a long- time wait...
It's what they do to prisoners,
- at least the lucky ones.
- Jesus.
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think about waving a white bandanna.
Poor Marines, so far from home for no good reason.
Think of your girls back home, waiting for you.
But a girl cannot stay home every night.
So who do you think they're with tonight?
And will she let him kiss her?
And will he comfort her at your funeral?
This sweet music is to make you think of your girls back home who are missing you.
This is all for now.
I'll see you tomorrow night.
Gunners!
Move, let's go!
Let's go, get up on the berm!
Gunners!
We're clear!
Get up the berm!
Baker Company, move out!
- Seen Second Platoon?
- I don't see them.
First Squad, move it out!
God, this place reeks.
- Go, go, go!
- Move out!
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go!
Go!
Go, go!
Drop your packs!
Go!
All clear!
- Jesus, you needed some exercise?
- He got lost.
A hundred landing craft heading for one beach and this guy gets lost.
Now I'm glad we did.
Jesus, what a mess.
Any theories why they ain't shooting?
It's getting on my nerves.
Maybe they're all dead.
What do you think, Doc?
You think they're all dead?
Mike, take six men and bring that gun onto the beach.
Second Platoon, let's move out!
Stay down.
Come on.
Move!
Move!
- Get down!
- Take cover!
Move out!
Cover fire!
Pour it on!
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!
Corpsman!
I'm gonna sling your arm and then I'll give you a shot for the pain!
Move, move!
Off the beach!
Take cover!
You got a girl back home, Marine?
We're gonna make sure she sees you, all right?
I need pressure on this wound!
Where's the fire coming from?
Where are they?
Look for a flash, shoot at it!
Let's go, let...
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!
You're over!
Third Squad, forward!
Move!
Where are they, sir?
We got ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock, pillbox!
Sergeant!
- Sergeant!
I think I can clear that out.
- What?
All right, you go.
Here.
Take these.
Check your weapon.
Yeah?
Go!
Cover!
Cover him!
Cover, cover!
Son- of- a- bitch.
Let's go!
Go!
Move it out!
Go, go, go!
Down, down, down!
It's clear.
Good work.
I thought you said it was clear!
It was!
Shit, I guess they're not in there firing at us then.
Lindberg!
Yeah!
Light it up!
I'll cover you, Ice!
Don't cover shit!
There's already enough people shooting!
One bullet and this thing goes up like a Roman candle!
Go!
Shift fire!
Shift your fire!
Go, go!
Shift your fire!
Shift your fire!
Go!
Move it out!
Hit the deck!
Stay down!
Wait for support!
Is this a bad battle or what?
It's a fucking slaughter.
Christ Jesus!
Get a machine gun team set up over here, now!
Thank God!
Tanks!
Runner!
Get those tanks up here!
Oh, shit.
Get down!
Corporal, watch your left flank!
Let's go without them!
Move out!
Move out!
Iggy, you gotta lift your side, he's gonna roll off.
Got it, Doc!
Incoming!
Move, move, move, move!
Keep moving!
Get that LVT up on the beach!
Keep moving!
You're next, pal, we're getting you out of here.
Move it!
Great news.
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa, 'cause that's where we're headed.
Not you and me.
Captain Severance asked me who else was in that picture, and Christ if I could remember, but it was Mike and Doc and Franklin and me and Hank Hansen but I just remembered, you were there, too.
I wasn't there.
'Course you were.
Neither was Hank.
He raised the first flag.
It was Harlon Block that raised that one.
Shit.
I told them it was Hank.
You weren't there, Mr. Smart Ass, how'd you know it was Harlon?
- You tell them it was me?
- No.
Like I said, I just remembered.
Good, keep your mouth shut.
They know there was somebody else, you can see it in the picture.
Then pick someone dead.
They don't want somebody dead, you dumb redskin, they want to ship us back to the States.
What did I tell you?
I wasn't there.
- You hear?
- All right.
Just settle down.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're not going anywhere.
Who the hell says?
This is horseshit.
You wounded, son?
No, sir.
Well, did you take out a nest of Japs butt- naked with your bare hands?
'Cause if I'm gonna give up my seat to a hero he better have a good goddamn story to tell.
No, sir.
Then enjoy it, 'cause they'll forget you before Christmas.
The sixth man, you got a name?
Sorry, still don't remember.
It's a damn shame, 'cause I promised the Major you'd know who it was.
Fact, you not knowing throws a doubt on you being one of the flag- raisers yourself.
Since no one wants to be embarrassed, the moment you land they'll turn you around, ship you off to Okinawa in time to meet your buddies on the beach.
So, why don't you stop screwing with me?
Give me a damn name.
Gangway!
Gangway!
Let's go, let's go!
Gangway!
Where the hell is that son-of-a-bitch?
Hayes!
Hayes?
Hayes, get your red ass over here!
Make me look like I don't know what my own men are doing with a flag the size of my mother's house?
God damn it, Ira, you shouldn't have lied to me.
You made me look like a complete asshole.
We're gonna miss you around here.
Good luck.
Now your name's in the paper, too.
Just heard your doctor say we're postponing your operation.
You're being shipped back to the mainland.
Everybody who saw that picture thought planting the flag meant victory.
That's all they wanted to know.
Victory.
Within a few weeks of that picture being taken, half the men in it were dead.
Mrs. Hansen!
Mrs. Hansen!
Did you know Hank was a hero?
- Are you proud of him, Mrs. Hansen?
- What was he like as a boy?
Look this way, please, ma'am.
What do you have to say about your son?
But somehow being a part of it meant something.
Looking at it, you could believe their sacrifice was not a waste.
Yeah, I might have thought that was Harlon, too.
It is.
Belle, their names are right here.
It's not him.
And he would be alive and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.
You think about that when you look at his picture, Ed.
And I need to rush home and change because there's the Governor's banquet and then there's the parade.
Imagine, the Governor is coming here to meet us.
Now, I'm wearing blue so, if...
- Are you going to change?
- We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin from CBS World News.
A press association has just announced that President Roosevelt is dead.
The President died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
All we know so far is that the President died at Warm Springs in Georgia.
Further updates every hour.
Temperatures will remain the same today, in the mid- 30s to low 40s with clear skies.
Hello?
Yes.
Of course.
No, we understand.
It wouldn't be right.
Thank you.
Here he is, gentlemen.
Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.
Senator Haddigan.
I'd like you to meet Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Damn good to meet you.
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.
Sorry?
That's Pima Indian talk, boy, don't you know your own language?
Took forever to memorize the damn gibberish.
Sorry, I've been away from the reservation too long, Senator.
- Doc.
- Ira.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
- That's you.
- Go, go, go, go.
Go.
Please welcome
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley,
Private First Class Ira Hayes,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon!
Holy shit.
Come in, come in, come in.
Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Bud Gurber.
- You showing the boys the sights?
- We saw a hell of a ball game.
That's great.
The bar's there, help yourself.
I got some briefing sheets for you here, just some simple things we want you to say.
Mostly, "Buy bonds," can't say that too often.
Itineraries, those are changing every couple minutes.
Everybody wants to meet you guys.
I got women sending up envelopes with stockings in them, notes written in lipstick.
We won't mention that to the press, am I right?
Have a drink, for Christ's sake.
My God, what you boys must have seen over there.
I've been watching the newsreels.
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.
So, we got a hell of a lot of money to raise, not a lot of time.
White House tomorrow, then we trot you over to shake hands with a couple of hundred Congressmen who won't pull a penny out of their pockets.
Politicians and actors.
You put them in a restaurant together, they'd die of old age before picking up the check.
Then New York City, Times Square, dinners with various hoi polloi, then Chicago...
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?
That's what we're calling the mothers of the dead flag- raisers.
You present each mother with a flag, they say a few words, people will shit money.
It'll be so moving.
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.
Lovely woman.
She knows how close you and her son were.
He wrote home about you.
She is very, very much looking forward to meeting you.
Hank wasn't in the picture.
Sorry?
Hank didn't raise that flag.
He raised the other one, the real flag.
The what?
The real...
The real flag?
There's a real flag?
Yeah, ours was the replacement flag.
We put it up when they took the other one down.
Am I the only one getting a headache here?
You know about this?
It was after it was already in the papers.
The mothers had already been told, but...
That's it, that's beautiful.
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Yeah, why tell me?
I'm only the guy that has to explain it to 150 million Americans.
Who is in the goddamn picture?
Are any of you guys in the goddamn picture?
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.
Six guys raising a flag over lwo Jima.
Victory is ours.
You're three of them, right?
This was the fifth day, sir.
The battle went on for 35 more.
Well, what'd you do, raise a goddamn flag every time you stopped for lunch?
Can I hit this guy?
You know what, I don't give a shit, you're in the picture, you raised the flag, that's the story we're selling, boys.
Are you deaf?
Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?
Harlon Block.
That's whose mother should be here if anyone's should be.
You know, I think this whole damn thing is a farce, you ask me.
You know what they're calling this bond drive?
The Mighty Seventh.
They might've called it the
"We're Flat Fucking Broke And Can't Even Afford Bullets
"So We're Begging For Your Pennies" bond drive, but it didn't have quite the ring.
They could've called it that, though, because the last four bond drives came up so short we just printed money instead.
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street, he'll tell you our dollar is next to worthless, we borrowed so much.
And nobody is lending any more.
Ships aren't being built.
Tanks aren't being built.
Machine guns, bazookas, hand grenades, zip.
You think this is a farce?
You want to go back to your buddies?
Well, stuff some rocks in your pockets before you get on the plane because that's all we got left to throw at the Japanese.
And don't be surprised if your plane doesn't make it off the runway because the fuel dumps are empty.
And our good friends, the Arabs, are only taking bullion.
If we don't raise $14 billion, and that's million with a "B," this war is over by the end of the month.
We make a deal with the Japanese, we give whatever they want and we come home, because you've seen them fight, and they sure as shit ain't giving up.
$14 billion.
The last three drives didn't make that much all together.
People on the street corners, they looked at this picture and they took hope.
Don't ask me why, I think it's a crappy picture myself.
You can't even see your faces.
But it said we can win this war, are winning this war, we just need you to dig a little deeper.
They want to give us that money.
No, they want to give it to you.
But you, you don't want to ask for it.
You don't want to give them hope.
You want to explain about this person and that flag.
Well, that's your choice.
Because if we admit we made a mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about and that will be that.
Gentlemen.
Mr. President, here they are.
- Well, hello.
Good to see you.
- Mr. President.
Darn good to see you, boys.
Heard you had a hell of a fight on your hands out there, hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation in Arizona, am I right?
Yes, Mr. President.
Being an Indian, you are a truer American than any of us.
Bet your people are proud to see you wear that uniform.
Very proud, sir.
They should be.
Well, I want to thank you for coming all this way to Washington to help us out.
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific now we need you to fight for a mountain of cash.
- And I don't expect you'll let us down.
- No, sir.
Good.
Go get it.
That's the end of this ceremony.
Let's take a look at this famous photo over here, see if I can pick you out.
My gosh.
There you are.
Boys.
Boys, this one's on me.
To those who can't be with us.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon.
May we have your autograph?
I suppose.
And your name is?
I don't know about you, but I get the impression
I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.
You're such a hero.
I feel honored to be in your presence.
That's just not true.
That's professional work.
Here, to professionals.
Here they are.
You're the guys in the photograph, right?
I heard you were on the train.
Let me shake your hands, John Tennack.
John Bradley.
These boys are with me, Harvard and Yale types, didn't fight a lick.
Pappies all rich sons- of- bitches.
Boys, shake hands with some real war heroes.
Excuse me for one moment.
You can buy them a drink while you're at it.
That's right.
Drinks for these men all the way around.
And you're the other one, aren't you?
John Tennack, Tennack Homes.
- Rene Gagnon.
- Pleased to meet you.
Have a drink, come on.
And here's my card.
Listen to me, Rene, when you get finished being famous you come see me because if you can sell bonds, you can sell homes.
Now, they're not gonna build homes anymore, they're gonna deliver them.
- You heard of prefab homes?
- No, sir.
Well, you will.
And you hang on to that card and you come see me, you hear?
- All right?
- Certainly will.
All right.
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?
If Mike and the guys could see us.
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it, would they?
Harlon!
Franklin!
Can you imagine Franklin on this train
eating at the dining car with all the silver?
We shouldn't be here, Doc.
There's gonna be a Hallelujah Day
When the boys have all come home to stay
And a million bands begin to play
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
And when we've lit the torch of liberty
In each blacked- out land across the sea
Ira!
Hey, Ira!
We heard the picture was posed!
What?
We heard you posed the picture!
Hey, Doc!
We're bigger than life, Doc!
And we'll heave a mighty sigh
When each gal can kiss the boy she kissed goodbye
And they'll come marching down Fifth Avenue
The United Nations in review
When this lovely dream has all come true
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka
Good job.
Thank you.
Thank you, girls!
And now, here are the men you've been waiting to meet, the men in white.
Right behind me here, the heroes of Iwo Jima,
Private First Class Rene Gagnon,
Private First Class Ira Hayes, and Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley!
Thank you.
It's good of you people to come out tonight in support of the war effort.
We really need you to buy bonds, that's for sure.
'Cause we can't win the war without your help.
As far as us being the heroes of Iwo Jima, that's just not the case.
We really didn't do much at all.
Especially him.
Especially me.
I was just a runner.
That's it.
We put up a flag.
The pole we attached it to was heavy, so it took a number of us.
We had our picture taken doing it.
The real heroes are dead on that island.
And we'd appreciate it if you bought bonds in honor of them.
Thank you.
Jump on any grenades, Ira?
Take out any machine gun nests I missed?
At least I fired my weapon.
All right, knock it off.
You hit anything or were you too drunk then, too?
What?
Guys!
Come on!
Stop it.
Knock it off.
The tall man with the high hat will be coming down your way
Get your savings out when you hear him shout
"Any bonds today?"
Any bonds today?
Bonds of freedom that's what I'm selling
Any bonds today?
Rene, right here.
Sit between these two boys.
Here comes the freedom man
Asking you to buy a share of freedom today ...for us and they need our help.
And, if you think about it, I think you'll realize that buying more bonds is not just the right thing to do but the only thing to do.
Yes, this war has gone on too long.
We have given too many lives.
And its cost...
- Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
- Strawberry.
...has been far too high.
But if we waver now, if we don't dig deep and give more than we think we can then those sacrifices would be wasted...
Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
...and those lives lost in vain.
Let's move!
Go, go!
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over.
Where the hell are our tanks?
Stuck in the sand.
Captain says you're to go without them.
Christ.
That's real good work you're doing there, Rene.
All right, prepare to move out.
Pass the word.
Second Platoon!
Move!
Move!
Move!
All right, Second Platoon, on your feet!
Let's move out!
Jackass.
Let's move out!
Go, go!
Move, move, move!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Second Platoon, move out!
Doc!
Doc, get out of there!
Corpsman!
Doc!
Doc, get the hell out of there!
May I have your attention, please.
Train number 48 with service from New York City, Boston,
Rochester, New York,
Toledo, Ohio, and South Bend, Indiana is now arriving on Track 7.
Train number 48 now arriving on Track number 7.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.
- Come on, boys.
- Let's go.
- Watch your step, ma'am.
- Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the heroes of Iwo Jima.
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.
Private First Class Ira Hayes.
And Private First Class Rene Gagnon.
Rene!
That's my boyfriend!
Who the hell is that?
I don't know.
- Rene, is that your girl?
- Hey, what do they call you?
How about a photo?
Hey, look at that!
What's your name, doll?
What's your name?
Hey, she's a beauty.
Let's go find a saloon.
Smile, boys.
Give them their money's worth.
Hey, Doc, how's the tour going for you?
Thank you.
Where exactly are you staying?
- I'm not sure yet.
- Just forget about that.
Senator, I'd like you to meet Corpsman John Bradley.
- Doc, right?
- Yes, sir.
Nice to meet you, Senator.
Good to meet you, young man.
Now, we appreciate everything you've done and everything you're doing.
- Thank you, sir.
- Quite all right.
This is Captain White.
- Colonel Johns.
- We're proud of you, Corpsman.
And then Colonel McCourtney.
- Major General Green.
- Nice to meet you.
Senator, this is Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Of course!
Now I hear you used a tomahawk on those Japs.
Is that true, Chief?
No, sir.
Well, tell them you did, makes a better story, huh?
- Attaboy.
- This is Captain Green.
John?
Madeline Evelley.
I recognize you from all the photographs.
I'm Hank's mom.
It's so nice to meet you, ma'am.
Hank was always talking about you.
This is PFC Rene Gagnon.
Pleasure to meet you, son.
Thanks for everything.
- My pleasure.
- Not at all.
Ira, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Strank, Mike's mom.
It's all right.
When I got the telegram, I...
I don't know what I'm trying to say here.
Knowing he was with you that day and seeing him in that photograph,
I don't know why it makes me feel better, but it does.
- It's so silly, isn't it?
- No, it's not.
How are you, son?
Thank you very much.
We're the largest furniture wholesaler in Illinois.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
- I'll make sure he calls.
- Well, thank you.
Thank you.
Are you Rene?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Franklin's mother.
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.
I'm Pauline, Rene's girlfriend.
Would you mind?
Paper said that's Hank, and I honestly can't tell.
It's horrible of a mother not to know her own son, isn't it?
But that's him, isn't it?
Well, to be honest, ma'am, it happened so quick, and with everything that was going on it's kind of hard to remember who was where.
But...
Yeah, I think...
I think that's where he was.
That's Hank.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Excuse us.
Take him outside.
I'm Pauline.
- Very nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
He was the best Marine I ever knew.
Thank you.
- You okay, Chief?
- Oh, Christ!
I'm okay.
Yeah, you look it.
You're gonna screw this up, aren't you?
You're gonna screw it up for all of us.
I've got him.
Get some sleep, Ira.
- Mike?
- Yeah?
- You see this?
- What?
- Mike!
- Oh, shit, go!
He's killing me!
Hey, Doc, you think they got them all?
What?
Well, they're not shooting at us.
Maybe we killed them all.
Or they ran off in the night or something.
Or they're waiting for us to start climbing.
Third Platoon!
Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.
- Just us?
- Yeah, just us, lgg.
All right, Third Platoon, move!
I tag along?
Yeah, you can lead the way if you want.
Get a good shot of my face.
It's your ass I'm gonna make famous, Hank.
Hey, that'll work for me, too.
Lieutenant, if you make it to the top, put this up.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, Iggy.
They never shoot at the first patrol.
- They don't?
- No.
They want us to go up to the top, signal to the others that it's okay, then shoot everybody else as they come up the mountain.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Unless of course they want to make an example of us and discourage all the others.
I think you're full of crap, you know that, Hank?
Really?
Jesus.
Thank God that ain't us.
Told you.
Boots, spread them out and put them on a line.
Set up a perimeter!
First Squad!
- Hank?
Find me a pole.
- Yeah.
Let's put this flag up.
Watch it.
Right over here.
Right here.
That's good.
That's good.
Right here, right here.
Got that end?
Hold that steady.
Lindberg.
- Hey, who's got rope?
- Right here.
Give me something.
Yeah, good.
That work?
Do it, fellas.
Keep it coming.
USMC!
USMC!
Shit, look at that!
Jeez, look at that.
Get down!
Take cover!
Cover with that .30!
- Watch it!
Twenty yards down, Hank!
- You see them?
- I got about 20 yards, left side.
- Lindberg, get the flamethrower!
- Boots, you see them?
- Cover right!
- About 20 yards down!
Duck one!
- You see them?
Keep the cover on!
Second Squad, you see them?
Get me some grenades!
I see them!
You see them?
Right flank, over to the right!
Cover me, I'm going down!
Careful, Iggy.
Easy.
All clear!
Okay, guys, who wants to be famous?
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
- God damn it.
Strank!
- Sir?
They want a phone line run up to the top of the mountain.
Let me guess, they picked us.
Second Platoon, let's go.
Get some exercise.
Let's go!
Get off your ass.
Oh, shit!
Hope it still works, 'cause you're not getting mine!
- Get Forrestal!
- All right, then.
I don't know whose idea it was, Mr. Secretary.
Well, it was goddamn brilliant.
I want that flag, Holland.
Mark my words, raising that son- of- a- bitch means a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.
I want that flag.
Yes, sir.
I'll make sure no one touches it.
You can count on me.
Fuck that.
That flag belongs to the men in this battalion.
That son- of- a- bitch thinks that our men died taking this ground so we could hand over our flag to some politician to pin to his wall?
He's out of his goddamn mind!
Get me that flag, and find another one to replace it.
You've gotta be shitting me.
Gagnon!
Get your ass over here.
Hey.
Hi, fellas.
How's it going?
Missed a beautiful shot, Joe.
It's that kind of day.
- Hey, Mike.
- Hell of a view, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant!
Captain says he wants that flag.
He wants this flag?
Yes, sir.
- We just put the damn thing up.
- Yes, sir.
Some kind of flag shortage?
He wants you to put this one up instead.
Hey, Mike.
Do me a favor and put this up, will you?
Yes, sir.
All right, let's find a pole.
Take the flag down, boys.
Captain's orders.
You heard him, let's do it.
There you go.
Lordy, she's a heavy one.
All right, hang on.
Put this on.
One hell of a view, huh?
Good view from up here.
Yes, I'd say so myself.
All right.
- Not in your way here, am I, Joe?
- Nah, I'm fine, thanks.
Hey, Doc, you wanna give us a hand here?
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.
Ready?
Ready?
Let's go.
You get it?
I don't know.
I wish I could've seen their faces.
Nobody even noticed that second flag going up.
Everybody saw that damn picture and made up their own story about it.
But your dad and the others knew what they had done and what they had not done.
All your friends dying, it's hard not to be called a hero for saving somebody's life.
But for putting up a pole?
You gotta be kidding.
Hey!
It took a lot of talented folks a long time to make that thing.
Just wait till tonight when it's lit properly and there's thousands of cheering people in the stands.
It's gonna look a lot better.
So, stadium lights come down, spotlight comes up and you get your cue.
You charge up this thing with the flag, you plant it at the top.
You smile, you wave.
You know the drill.
You want us to plant the flag on a pile of papier- mache.
Hey, that's show biz.
And try and stand how you stood the first time you planted it.
Just, you know, pretend the other three guys are with you.
The dead guys.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, not a problem.
Good.
But where do we imagine Hank is standing?
Sorry?
Well, seeing that he wasn't there, it'll be kind of hard for us to leave a space for him.
I think you know exactly where he was.
You pointed him out to his mother.
This is bullshit.
I planted that damn thing once, and I'm not doing it again.
- Hayes!
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
Hayes.
Hayes, get your ass back here or you're going on report.
Hayes!
You wanna do your damn job?
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Come on!
He's with me!
Hey, he's with me!
- Back off!
- Sir, he's with me.
Okay?
He's with me.
Ira, put the goddamn chair down!
- Put the chair down, son!
- Put the chair down, Ira!
Tell them drop their sticks!
Ira, they're cops, they're supposed to have nightsticks.
You're not supposed to be in the street swinging a chair.
- Calm down, son.
- Sir, turn around, please.
That poster right there?
The one on the end, that's him.
- That's him?
- Yes, sir.
You read the papers?
Christ.
We got another fucking hero.
Get him out of here.
- Can you do that?
- Yes, sir.
Put the goddamn chair down.
And let's go.
Did you start this?
He didn't serve me!
I don't make the rules.
We don't serve Indians.
He needs to go sleep it off.
Soldier Field.
You hear that?
What the hell is that?
I can't figure it out.
Keep an eye out.
It sounds like it's coming from up there.
They're using grenades.
They're killing themselves.
Ira, let's go.
Come on.
Let's go, Ira.
Come on.
Thank God.
Jesus.
Look at you, Chief.
You found him.
Holy shit.
You would have to pick today.
Vandegrift is here with enough brass to start a fucking band.
Come on, let's go.
Can you walk?
- Yes, sir.
- By yourself?
All right, look.
I don't care if you have to carry him get him to the top, plant that flag, and don't fucking fall off.
Get him in his stuff.
I'll stall these guys for as long as I can.
Hurry up.
Jesus Christ.
And now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Cover!
Harlon!
Harlon!
Get your fire team up in that position!
O'Hare!
First Fire Team!
Work around!
BAR, you, on the side of the ridge!
Covering fire, boys, go, go, go!
Jackson, work your team around to the left!
Cover!
Left flank!
Left flank!
Franklin, Gust, go check it out!
Hustle up, boys!
We got them!
Clear!
One hell of an experience.
Move out!
Cease fire!
They're my men!
You're targeting our men!
You're targeting our...
Get me another radio!
Sergeant?
Sergeant!
Mike!
Mike, Mike, Mike.
Mike?
Mike.
Hey, where's Doc?
Corpsman!
Oh, shit.
How's his breathing?
Harlon, move, buddy.
Hey, Mike.
Mike, Mike, can you hear us?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on, Mike.
Mike?
Mike, can you hear us?
All right, let's go!
Move out!
I'm gonna get a stretcher.
Let's take him down, move him off the beach.
Ladies and gentlemen, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
Corpsman!
Hank!
Hank!
Doc, they killed me.
Harlon!
Doc, they killed me.
Come on, Harlon.
Harlon, stay with me.
Franklin!
I'm fine, Ira.
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
- Where'd he go?
- Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Iggy!
Iggy!
You shut up.
You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Iggy!
Does it open?
Iggy!
Iggy!
Iggy, are you down there?
Iggy!
Can't tell who it is, but he's one of ours.
I had to go outside to throw up.
Look what they did to the poor son-of-a-bitch.
You okay, Chief?
Just let it go.
If that doesn't pry open their wallets, nothing will.
Jesus Christ, he's drunk.
Goddamn Indians.
Come on, Chief.
Let's get you home.
That's not what I hear.
I called around, I'm not stupid.
He's been drunk since he started this damn tour, making a spectacle of himself.
Just about choked that poor woman at the reception, blubbering.
Jesus Christ, you're supposed to be watching these men.
Yes, sir.
Well, he's making us look like regular asses.
Well, with all due respect, sir, he never wanted to come on this trip in the first place.
We had to pull him, kicking and screaming, off that boat.
He wants to be with his unit.
What unit?
They're all fucking dead.
This is how he honors those men?
By drinking and throwing up, and...
You know what?
He wants it, great, we'll send him back.
Get him packed and on a train today.
He's an embarrassment to the uniform.
Yes, sir.
I'll do it.
Yeah, no, that's...
That's good.
That's what I want.
I know it's a good thing, raising the money and that, 'cause we need it.
But,
I can't take them calling me a hero.
All I did was try not to get shot.
Some of the things I saw done, things I did,
they weren't things to be proud of, you know?
Mike...
Mike was a hero.
You ever meet him?
No.
Best Marine I ever met.
You know, Chief, I think if Mike was sitting here instead of you he'd be saying the same thing about himself,
not being a hero.
Maybe.
He was a good guy.
But I think that he would be ashamed of me, seeing me the way I am.
Think I could see my ma before they ship me off?
Think they'd do that?
See my ma?
I'm sorry, Ira.
We got stories now to tell our kids, I guess.
Keep your head down.
All aboard.
Good luck, Chief.
I think I saw him once after that.
It was maybe six or seven years after the war.
I was working as a salesman, doing a lot of driving.
I was driving west across Texas.
I was just trying to get where I was going so I could get home.
And I saw this guy hitchhiking on the side of the road.
And, for a second, I thought it might've been him.
I always regret that I didn't stop, but I was in a hurry.
And he was an Indian.
We always told the press that Ira insisted that he was going back to fight with his unit which was at least partially true, but
that isn't what got the headlines.
We're engaged.
Excuse me a minute, darling.
- Hey, Doc?
- Yeah?
- Got a minute?
- Yeah.
I'll see you at the car.
- You hear I'm getting married?
- I did, Rene.
That's great.
Yeah, it's something she wants.
She waited for me all this time.
She's not used to all this, but she's a good girl.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
So, I was wondering if you'd be my best man.
Me?
Don't you have somebody at home, a buddy, you'd rather ask?
Well, I didn't really make many.
The ones who didn't go, it's...
Well, it's hard to even talk to them.
You know?
Yeah, I know.
I'd be proud to.
Thank you.
I better go drag her away from them before she announces
I'm gonna be president of General Motors or something.
All right.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Rene, you're a lucky man.
- Big smile, Mrs. Gagnon!
- Say cheese!
I couldn't complain because the press loved them, so they wrote more articles and people bought more bonds.
The tour went on with just Rene and your dad.
And the true heroes are the men who didn't make it home from lwo Jima, the men who died at Iwo Jima and in other campaigns.
We ask that you honor the memory of those men by buying the war bonds and helping us to win this war.
Thank you.
City after city, I thought the damn thing'd never end.
And this rumor kept going around that the photograph had been staged.
I remember your dad telling them that he wished he'd known he was having his picture taken because he would've ducked the hell out of it.
Whose idea was it?
Who wanted to stage the thing?
Come on, it was you?
Was there truth to the rumor that that picture was staged, Doc?
- Come on!
Doc?
- Can you answer that?
I remember when your dad got shot.
All hell was busting loose.
People back home saw that picture and thought it was over when we took Suribachi.
We wished.
Anyways, we're pinned down.
Mortars, shells, machine guns.
Fire coming from every which direction, right?
And we hear somebody call, "Corpsman down."
Corpsman down!
Blood was spurting out of his throat, and Doc was doing everything he could.
And the Corpsman looks up at him and he knows what this means, to be shot in the neck.
He knows he's dying, you can see that.
But still in his eyes, he's pleading with Doc to save his life.
And Doc can't.
- You okay, Doc?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah, you look fine.
- I'm okay.
Keep down, all right?
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.
Okay.
Corpsman.
Corpsman!
For God sake, Corpsman!
Corpsman?
Corpsman.
Incoming!
Let me see.
It's not that bad.
You're gonna be okay.
All right?
Just stay with me.
Look at me.
Took us a half- hour to find your dad.
He could've bled to death.
Coming down.
Thanks.
Vets'll tell you about being hit but not wanting to leave their buddies.
Usually, they're lying.
You'll take any excuse to get out of there.
But it happens.
You get the feeling you're letting them down.
I could see that in your dad's face.
He wanted to go, he'd seen enough.
But he didn't want to leave us.
Now, he was a hell of a good man, your dad.
Yeah.
While we were sitting there on the beach, we heard this great roar.
And we looked up.
That was the first of thousands of landings on Iwo.
- Look at that.
- Yeah.
How about that.
I'm gonna head back, all right?
Good luck.
That island saved a lot of lives.
A lot of lives.
I don't know what else to tell you.
After the bond tour my dad finally got his operation.
By the time he got home the war was over.
First thing he did was ask my mom to marry him.
Ira tried to get on with his life and put it all behind him.
Thank you for having me here today.
It's an honor to be in front of such a strong people.
Because of the war white men will understand Indians a lot better.
And it's going to be a better world.
But life had other plans for him.
You're...
You're him, aren't you?
You're the hero, right?
Great.
All right, kids, go get your picture taken.
Oh, that's great.
That's great.
All right, now say cheese.
Cheese!
That's great!
Okay.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Thanks.
- Come on.
- That's a hero, kids.
Hero, lift this basket, will you?
It's too heavy for me.
Rene tried to take advantage of those offers he'd received on the bond tour.
Yes.
G-A-G-N-O-N.
Right.
Pronounced Rene.
Rene, yes.
- Okay, I actually called last week.
- Yes.
Okay, yes.
Mr. Gagnon.
I gave Mr. Tennack your message.
I'm sure he'll call you.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
But he was yesterday's hero.
He even applied for a job at the local police station.
They said he wasn't qualified.
After working the factory with Pauline he tried a few things but spent the rest of his life as a janitor.
But Ira...
Ira!
You got a visitor.
Ira always made the news.
I could never find out why he did it, but one day Ira just took off.
He walked and hitched over 1,300 miles from Arizona to Texas.
He found Harlon Block's father working his field.
His wife, Belle, had left him soon after they discovered Harlon died.
She never forgave him for letting her son go off to war.
And Ira told him the truth, that it had been his son who raised the flag with them, his son in the photograph.
And then he just turned and walked away.
Though the flag- raising meant nothing to him, he somehow knew it would mean everything to them.
Thanks for calling.
Just as Belle knew all along.
The press soon found out and called Hank's mom with the news that it wasn't her son after all.
The last time they all saw each other was at the unveiling of the Marine Corps War Memorial.
And even though he planted the first flag above lwo Jima,
Hank's mother and father weren't invited.
Ira.
It's good to see you, Ira.
Hell of a statue.
It wasn't long after that that they found Ira.
The papers said he died of exposure.
There was no autopsy.
It was about that same time when my father got in his car early one morning telling my mom he had something to do.
He drove to a town on the other side of Wisconsin where Iggy's mom lived.
Ever since she heard the news about her son she'd been trying to find out how he died, and no one would tell her.
I never found out what he told her, but I can pretty much guarantee it wasn't the truth.
My mother would ask him what was troubling him.
He would never say.
And every year, as it got close to Memorial Day, the reporters would start calling asking to interview my father.
No, I'm sorry.
He's fishing in Canada.
We were always instructed to say the same thing.
Okay.
Thanks.
When Mr. McCandless retired, my father bought the funeral home where he'd worked since coming home.
He spent the rest of his life running the business and raising his family.
He never spoke about the war or about the flag-raising, never told us anything.
The first time I heard any of these stories was after he died.
Where is he?
Oh, God.
He's not here, Dad.
He died.
Who?
Who died?
Iggy.
Iggy.
Christ, poor Iggy.
I hadn't thought of him for years.
How do you know about Iggy?
You were calling for him, when you collapsed.
I wasn't looking for Iggy.
I was looking for you.
I wanted to...
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry I wasn't a better father.
Talked to you more.
I just...
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
You were the best father a man could have.
Did I ever tell you they took us swimming?
No, Dad.
After we planted the flag, we came down off the mountain and they let us swim.
It was the funniest thing.
All this fighting and we were jumping around in the water like kids.
That's the way I remember lggy now.
I finally came to the conclusion that maybe he was right.
Maybe there's no such thing as heroes.
Maybe there are just people like my dad.
I finally came to understand why they were so uncomfortable being called heroes.
Heroes are something we create, something we need.
It's a way for us to understand what is almost incomprehensible, how people could sacrifice so much for us.
But for my dad and these men, the risks they took, the wounds they suffered, they did that for their buddies.
They may have fought for their country, but they died for their friends.
For the man in front, for the man beside them.
And if we wish to truly honor these men, we should remember them the way they really were, the way my dad remembered them.
Come on, Doc!

Russell, kindly turn down the electronica.
God almighty, we ask you to bless this feast that lie before us... and please allow these spent lottery tickets... with their silver scratchery seasonings... to nourish our bodies, as they were unable to do the same to our wallets.
Lord, thank you for the untimely frost you sent... what claimed our pointless banana orchards.
Oh, I was a fool to plant bananers on a mountain.
You made sure of that.
In short, thank you for nothing.
You want to thank the Lord for that truck boat truck?
You silly bitch, don't be telling Him about my truck boat truck.
But, Daddy, you tell everybody about that.
That's your pride and joy.
Because it's bad-ass, is why.
Check out this mess.
Listen to that 450 big block!
So enjoy my 450 big block, Lord... which you have seen fit to take from me in your jealous rage.
We had best reap your holy rewards... in tonight's drawing of the Tricky Two Jackpot Extravaganza!
You best to make it so!
Amen.
What the hell was that about?
is he serious?
I didn't come down here to be threatened.
Lord, I need a favor.
Think you can hook me up?
You know, no. I'm not giving you the Tricky Two numbers.
OK, sorry, sweetie.
Well, how about just a little taste of the alpha and omega?
Then I would be giving you both of the numbers.
No!
I'm saying I'm not doing it.
- Come on.
- Look, I just can't do it.
But you know who you should try?
And I'm serious.
Satan.
- Satan's a self...
- l know.
But you know something?
He likes working with the elderly.
It's not a bad choice.
I'll never masturbate again.
Come on.
I know.
Woman, get in here!
They pulling the numbers!
Tonight's winning numbers for the Tricky Two Jackpot Extravaganza are...
- 7.
- 7.
And... 4!
7 and 4?
7 and 4?
I got it!
You got it, boy.
And "W".
Yes, "W".
So tonight's two winning numbers... for the Tricky Two are 7 and 4 and "W".
Have a problem with that?
Well, move to New York.
A portion of tonight's Tricky Two will benefit Georgia public schools.
Georgia public schools.
Someone has to build the cars.
Damn that Tricky Two!
They tricked us again with the third number.
Damn lottery.
I ain't never won Jack Squattery.
"l ain't won jack a lot from the squattery.
"The lottery should be the jacksquattery...
"'cause I ain't jack squatting a lot...y."
There's more.
"They should rename the lottery to the jacksquattery...
"'cause that's all I ever win in it."
There you go.
Five exclamation points.
Oh, you slap that on a hat and you gonna make you some money.
Make me some money.
- Damn it, I need some money!
- Of course you do.
Listen, Early, I'm catching some heat from the State gaming commission.
Apparently they want someone to win the Tricky Two other than me.
So tonight, I want you to cup my balls.
Up to now, Lord, you've had your gigantic sandal foot placed... on the windpipe of all my dreams.
But even as you try to defeat me, I hatch another idea to defeat you.
Amen.
Or is it?
Listen, play this favorite record backwards, and smash it!
I'll do you. I'll do you hard.
I'll do you till your brains fly out and kiss your soul into the dirt.
I'll rape you like a monster pig in hell.
What...
What did you need?
- The Tricky Two jackpot numbers.
- No, no, no.
How about I burn your ass like a sweet potato?
- Yeah, OK.
- Really?
Oh, well, then, you're gonna steal money from the government by falsifying...
No, that one sucks, wait a minute.
Ah, Satan, come on.
Use your A game here.
Cheat on...
Tell her to pee in her neighbor's brain.

- Yes, you nailed it.
- That's it.
- No!
Shut up.
I double dare you!
I'm a big time potty mouth.
Swearing makes me tough.
You're a confused individual.
Granny, Granny!
Gather up the family.
This is the night that Early Cuyler detrickulatates The Tricky Two.
Hey, who here killed my favorite snake?
Welcome to tonight's Tricky Two jackpot extravaganza.
And now, yank forth the balls!

Partial brain matter.
Of course.
So, tonight's numbers are:
Acorn, bolt, pine straw, pine cone, hog testicle... shell casing, shell casing... eyeball, and finally squirrel skull with partial brain matter... sort of still in it.
I am a winner!
I'm gonna get my grandma that operation she needs for a transplant.
Bingo!
Bingo!
Bingo, bingo, bingo!
Bingo!
Bingo, bingo!
Well, congratulations, Early.
You finally won the lottery.
Shirley Jackson's The Lottery.
He doesn't understand.
Did you...
You did take freshman English, didn't you?
But then, you know, it's the short story, the winner gets stoned.
- Too late, chief.
- No, we're not...
All right.
Everyone, just sit down.
"The morning of June 27th was clear and sunny...
"with the fresh warmth of a full summer day...
"Stone hit her on the side of the head.
"lt isn't fair!
It isn't right!
"Mrs. Hutchinson screamed.
And then they were upon her."
- Early?
Your opinion?
- When we gonna get high?
- l mean, I won the damn drawing, right?
- Oh, you won the drawing.
The drawing and the quartering!
Just lower the check.
See, right here it says that...
"You will be ripped asunder by the 4,000 horsepower semis...
"of the a-truck-o-lypse.
This Thursday, Thursday, Thursday."
Standard echo on the...
- Damn.
- ...weekday name.
Wake up, Granny.
Hey, Granny.
- You won the lottery!
- l did?
- Oh, yeah, you done it.
- Oh, Early!
You're such a sweet, sweet...
Son of a bitch!
You die in hell!
Hey, darling, how much for your corn dog?

- Rocks are boring.

Still to come...
Any minute now.
Granted the creature is elastic, and I didn't foresee that, but...
- Switch over to the beauty tips, sonny.
- There's still the possibility... that you could watch her rip somehow.
Just look at that painted up whore.
Nick her with the scissors.
- Granny's got a little itch on her nose.
- Wait, don't go!
Could you just give me a little scratchy scratch?
- Hey, anything could happen here still.
- Right here?
- Just a little lower.
- Right there?
Little lower.
Just...
Just wait.
Wait till...
I'll...
I'll call the drivers.
Super Goliath!

Roger that, I'm at the rest area.
Getting my groove on.

Oh, forget it.
This sucks.
Just a wee hair lower.
Well, I'll go down right here.
That's far as I'm goin'.
Oh, that's it.
Yeah, you're good at that, aren't you?
Spank me.
Granny, I ain't goin' no lower, you know it.
Hi, how you doing?
Well, I'm OK.
Hey, listen.
You ever see one of these here up close?

And finally, squirrel skull.
In my house, everyone had a job.
It was my father's job to pay the bills.
- I'm hungry.
- I'm cold.
I'm hungry and cold.
Eat a piece of cracker.
Your father's coming.
I've got the money.
It was my mother's job to keep the house and the kids in line.
Boy...
Quit leaving your socks all over the place.
Boy, mop the floor.
Girl, clean up the table.
Good job, baby.
As kids we only had one job:
go to school and get decent grades.
Bye, Mommy.
Love you.
Have a good day.
Don't come home stupid.
We won't.
I could usually get a good grade just by talking about Dr. Martin Luther King.
Free at last, free at last.
Thank God Almighty, we are free at last.
In English class...
My book report is on Dr. Martin Luther King.
In history...
My history report is on the Birmingham Bus Boycott led by Dr. Martin Luther King.
The only place Martin Luther King didn't work was in math.
Chris, what's the square root of 144?
1963?
The same year that Dr. Martin Luther King led the March on Washington?
No, it's 12.
All right, class.
Pick up your report cards on the way out and bring them back signed tomorrow.
Oh, no.
What?
I got an F.
Aw, man.
That's rough.
What's your mom gonna say?
I don't know, but it ain't gonna be "Free at last." Look at my babies!
Drew, you got a B-plus in gym.
Good job!
You can have whatever you want for dinner.
Really?
Thanks, Mom.
Can I have pork chops and spaghetti?
You sure can.
Yes!
Well, Mom, I got a B in science.
What do I get?
You can have whatever dessert you want.
Uh, ice cream and cake?
Ice cream and cake it is.
Good job, baby.
Boy, don't you see me cooking?
Sorry.
Where's your report card?
They didn't hand them out yet.
I couldn't bring myself to tell my mother I got an F.
Next to dealing drugs, getting bad grades was the worst thing you could do.
It was worse than this.
Tonya, what happened?
Mama, I had to smoke that fool.
Oh, not him.
I'm talking about this D you got in algebra.
And worse than this.
Drew!
Where is that boy?
What the hell is wrong with you?
I'm following my dream, Mama.
I'm gonna be a country and western singer.
I'm not talking about that.
I'm talking about this F.
Now, take your Johnny Cashless ass upstairs and study.
You think I'm playing with you?
And where'd you get that guitar from?
You'd better not be selling no damn drugs in my house.
I didn't know what to do, but I couldn't give her that report card.
- Well, let me know when you get it.
- Yes, ma'am.
Need any help cooking?
Sure.
Thank you, baby.
I figured, if I showed her how useful I could be, she wouldn't kill me when she found out.
While I was trying to figure out what to do about my F, my father was home sick, trying to figure out how he got the gout.
Oh, baby... when did you get the gout?
I don't know.
It just happened.
I know you're probably wondering, what is the gout?
Well gout, or the gout as some people like to call it, is a form of arthritis, which causes severe swelling usually in the ankle or the big toe.
It's caused by a poor diet, including things like... smothered pork chops.
Needs some salt.
Smothered chicken-fried bacon.
Needs some salt.
And smothered chicken-fried bananas.
Not bad.
Needs salt.
Are you out your damn mind?
All right, I'm going to work the phones over at the real estate office today.
Try not to eat any junk.
I'll be home in time to make dinner.
I can't eat that stuff all day.
You can if you want to get rid of the gout.
Give me a kiss.
When are you gonna turn in your report card?
I was thinking, it's so busy that if I didn't say anything,
Miss Morello will just forget about it.
It didn't take much to graduate from my old school.
All you needed was a ride to the graduation.
Who are you?
I was in Ms. Jenkins' class.
Oh.
Here.
Thank you.
Chris, where's your report card?
My mom's been really busy.
I promise I'll have it by tomorrow.
Make sure you do.
Because my father was used to working all the time, staying home was tough.
But at least he got to watch one of his favorite things:
Soap operas.
The Yankees were good, but not better than The Young and the Restless.
At Corleone, if you needed something like a forged report card or a tardy slip, there was one guy that could get it for you, and his name was Fisher.
Hey, Fisher.
Who's this?
Chris.
Tell him I'm not talking to him.
He's not talking to you.
Chris.
- He a friend of yours?
- Yeah.
Pat him down.
- He's clean.
- What does he want?
- I need a new...
- Hey, hey.
- Tell him I'm not talking to him.
- He's not talking to you.
He needs a new report card.
He got an F, but he doesn't want to show it to his mother.
Okay, I got it.
It's a two-part job.
He needs a report card with an A for his mother to sign, and a report card with an F with his mother's signature on it.
- So you'll do it?
- I 'm not talking to him.
He's not talking to you.
So you'll do it?
Okay, let's say I do this for him.
What's he gonna do for me?
What do you want?
How about a book report for English?
Hey, what the hell's the matter with you?
- Don't you see me talking to you?
- Don't you see him talking to you?
- Can it be on Martin Luther King?
- Deal.
Meet me in the science lab storage room at 3:00.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
Hey, look over there.
Hey, Julius.
Uh...
Rochelle's not here.
No, no, no.
Rochelle told me to stop by and check on you.
And I brought you this.
What, a salad?
Yeah, I gotta get back to The Young and the Restless.
You watching The Young and the Restless?
Yeah.
Why?
Usually my father was uncomfortable around Sheila, but not when The Young and the Restless was on.
You think Victor and Nicky are going to stay together?
Sure look so.
It's like they were watching a game.
I think you deserve all for just being my mistress.
Ooh.
I've never had a forged report card before, but Greg told me Fisher was the best.
One time he made such a good fake, they arrested the guy who made the original.
Hey, Ma, I got my report card.
Oh.
Let me see.
I was scared.
Felt like I was giving a fake diamond to Lil' Kim.
An "A" in math?
Chris, this is so great.
You got an "A" in math?
That's right.
So what?
What's three times three?
- Nine.
- What's four times five?
- Twenty.
- What's eleven times eleven?
Shut up.
Can you sign this?
Does John know who Victor slept with?
Oh, he does?
!
Julius!
Oh, hey, you know, I gotta go.
All right, I'll talk to you later.
Oh, man!
- Who was that?
- Oh, that was Monica.
She was the hairdresser's friend.
She just wanted to know what happened on The Young and the Restless.
Oh, you two were on the phone an awfully long time.
It was a good show today.
Did you know that your son got an "A" in math?
My man!
That must be why your teacher called this afternoon.
Yeah, she wants you to come down to school on Wednesday and talk about Chris's grade.
Will Rochelle find out about Chris' actual grade?
How long will Chris be able to keep up this lie?
Will Julius ever get rid of the gout?
Will Tonya ask Chris more math questions?
Will Drew get any lines?
Find out this and more, when
Everybody Hates Chris returns.
Everybody ha-ates Chris.
Once I got my mother's signature on my report card,
Fischer had what he needed to complete my plan.
What?
I'm a natural.
Now beat it.
Since I had the cards in place, all I had to do was keep my mother and Mrs. Morello from seeing each other and I would be home free.
Chris, do you have your signed report card?
Sure do.
My mother says she won't be able to come to the school tomorrow.
My father has the gout.
Did you say "the gout"?
Yes.
The gout.
I'm concerned about your grade, Chris.
Well, my mom is, too.
She told me I better get a C on my next report card.
And then she...
Well, let's just say it's kind of hard to sit down.
So I guess she's "Young"
and he's "Restless."
Okay, wait, wait.
We're gonna come back tomorrow for the update.
Wait, wait, wait.
So does Victor's ex-wife know about him and Nicky?
Ooh, you know what?
Hey, babe.
How you doing?
What's going on here?
Why didn't you tell us Julius likes The Young and the Restless?
I didn't know.
This is Pam.
You remember Pam.
Good.
How are you?
How long y'all been here?
Oh, about three, four hours.
We're just catching up on the soaps.
Oh, and this is my girl Monica.
Monica, that's Rochelle.
Nice to meet you, Monica.
Why do you look so familiar to me?
You tried to sell me food stamps down by the subway that day.
I thought you said you weren't selling food stamps.
You were selling food stamps?
I wasn't selling no food stamps.
Julius, go get the phone.
You hear the phone ringing.
It rang, like, three times already.
Thank you, baby.
Girl, that gout is making him lose his mind.
Does gout mess with your hearing?
Hello?
Hey, Mrs. Morello.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hold on.
Honey, it's for you.
Where'd they go?
They left, gout boy.
What?
An F?
What happened?
The teacher just told me that Chris got an F.
But he said he got an A.
I can't believe that boy looked me dead in the eye and lied to me.
How you gonna handle this?
Translation:
do you want to kill him, or should I?
Hmm... oh, I know what to do.
Pancakes?
Hey, Mom, we're having pancakes?
No, Chris is having pancakes.
That's my baby's reward for getting an A.
Can I have some pancakes?
Do you get an A?
- I got a B.
- That's not an A.
Can I have some pancakes?
I think my foot's getting better.
I might be able to make it to work tomorrow.
Pancakes are for people who get A's, not for people who get the gout.
Baby, you want anything else?
My A student deserves nothing but the best.
No.
No.
Oh, by the way, my teacher says she won't be able to see you today.
That's okay, baby.
I'll talk to her next time.
You want some butter?
My foot's looking better, don't you think?
Why are you talking about your foot?
Your son has no conscience.
In there eating pancakes like he actually got an A.
If you didn't want him to have the pancakes, what'd you give them to him for?
For him to feel guilty and confess.
But that's okay.
Tomorrow I got something for him.
Baby, let's talk about this.
Come on.
Oh, so now you want to talk to me?
Why don't you just talk to your friends, since you talk to them all the time?
Rochelle, those are your friends.
We were just talking about the soaps.
Are you jealous?
Hell, yeah.
Damn skippy.
How would you feel if you came home and I was sitting there talking to a bunch of your friends about football?
- You like football?
- No, I don't like football.
Julius, you always want to talk to me about bills or the kids.
I just think it would be nice to talk about something else for a change.
You want to talk about the gout?
No!
I don't want to talk about the gout!
So it worked?
Yep.
I told my mother that Miss Morello was busy, and I told Miss Morello that my mother was busy.
That was that, and I'm just glad it's over.
They say when you're about to die your life flashes right before your eyes.
Well, here's what mine looked like.
Dude, you're definitely not in there.
Bye, Chris.
Don't tell any lies when you get to heaven.
Hey, Chris, can I have your comic books?
That's a $2 pair of underwear you're messing up.
Rest in peace Tobby...
Chris.
- Hi, Mom.
- Oh, don't mind me.
I'm just here to watch my brilliant, mathematician son in action.
Miss Morello said it would be okay.
If I could just be cool, maybe everything will be all right.
Today we're doing fractions.
What does three twelfths plus three fourths equal?
Ooh!
Ooh!
Me!
Pick me.
Rochelle.
Chris has an answer.
He got an A.
That's right.
He did get an A.
If I could drive, I'd do this.
I don't know the answer.
No?
Well, how is that possible?
You're the math wiz.
The human calculator.
You got an A.
I actually got an F.
This must be how Marion Barry felt when that tape got out.
Miss Morello, thank you for your time.
Come on, Chris.
See you later, Stymie.
Ma, I can explain.
Okay.
Go ahead.
- For real?
- Yeah.
Explain this.
Okay.
I was afraid you'd get mad at me for getting an F.
I thought I could do better next semester, so I changed my grade, forged your signature onto the report card and gave it to Miss Morello.
I thought you wouldn't find out.
"I thought you wouldn't find out."
Boy, what do I look like, Boo-Boo the Fool?
You're running around here lying, forging my signature.
Have you lost your mind?
Look, Chris, if you lie you steal, if you steal, you kill, and I am not getting your behind out of jail.
Chris... if you would have put this much effort into passing the class in the first place, you wouldn't be in this mess.
I am very upset that you failed that class, but I'm more upset that you lied to me.
You are not stupid, Chris.
Don't act like it.
Remember, I bought you in this world, I'll take you right out.
You understand me?
Yes, ma'am.
All right.
Now bring your behind home.
My mother had a funny way of making me feel like the smartest idiot in the world.
Wait, that's it?
No, you better bring that grade up, or I'm gonna slap the wax out your ears.
After I got caught, my parents finally had something to talk about.
What happened with Chris today?
Oh, I got it all handled.
How's your foot?
It's all right.
Got a surprise for you.
I watched your soap today.
Yeah?
Yeah, but if you don't feel like talking...
No, no, no, no.
We can talk about it.
Oh.
Did you know that Nicky was a stripper?
A stripper?
Mm-hmm.
Does Victor know?
He does now.
Things always worked out best in my house when everybody did their job.
And after being more embarrassed than I'd ever been in my life, all I had to do was one more thing.
Mom, I got my report card.
A D!
My baby got a D.
And you're happy about that?
I'm just happy I don't have to smack the chap off your lips.
to quit leaving this damn yo-yo on the floor?
What are you trying to do, kill me?
I forgot where I left it.
Well, will you remember when I fall down the steps and break my neck?
Sometimes it felt like all my mother did was yell at everybody.
Tanya, close the door!
You trying to freeze the whole house?
Drew, turn that mess down!
You trying to make everybody in the house go deaf?
And get your feet off my table.
Julius!
Pick up your drawers!
Do I have to do everything around here?
And when I say my mother yelled at everybody, I mean everybody.
Rochelle, what did I tell me?
Are you trying to drive me crazy?
But there was one person who always put my mother in a good mood.
Daddy!
My mother loved her daddy, and we did, too.
Oh, where's Mama?
Oh, I left her at the hair dresser.
Where are them grandkids of mine?
Where they at?
Hey!
My grandfather was a great storyteller.
And he didn't think I was playing when I smacked him in the head with that brick.
Until this day, when I go in there, my food is free.
Oh, man, do you have any more good jokes?
Do I got any more good jokes?
Come on, now!
Knock, knock.
Who's there?
- Pass me them pork chops.
- Pass me them pork chops who?
No, pass me them pork chops right there.
He got you!
I ain't playing with you.
What's the rest of the joke, Grandpa?
Ooh!
Okay, knock, knock.
Who's there?
Oh, Lordy.
Oh, Lordy who?
I'm dying.
I'm dying who?
I'm... having a heart...
You're having a heart who?
Daddy?
Daddy.
Daddy?
I never did find out who was there.
My grandfather passing away was the first time I had to deal with a death in the family.
I didn't know how to react, and I guess my mother didn't, either, because instead of doing this...
Damn.
Damn.
Damn!
...she did this.
Good morning, everybody.
I hadn't seen my mother that happy since Lionel Richie went solo.
I can't believe Gene is gone.
I can't believe he never finished that joke.
I'm never eating pork chops again.
I can't believe he died sitting right here.
Everybody has to die someplace.
Now eat your eggs.
I hate eggs.
Can I have some toast?
Sure, Tonya.
No problem.
Hey, Mom, uh, do I have to go to school today?
Usually, the only death that could keep us out of school was our own.
No, not if you don't want to.
Cool.
Chris, do you want to stay home from school today?
No, I have a quiz.
- Can I stay home, too?
- Sure.
I didn't know what was wrong with my mother, but at that moment, all I could think of doing was this.
Snap out of it, woman!
Well, everybody have a nice day.
That was weird.
Man, your grandfather died?
That's rough.
I had a parakeet that died once.
I cried for three weeks.
My mom is acting really strange.
You mean strange like...
There's a TV in my head!
Please, just make it go away!
Even the crackheads would be scared of that.
No.
She's just really nice.
So, were you guys close?
Yeah.
Chris, why don't you stand up and tell the rest of the class what you're discussing with Gregory.
My grandfather died.
Chris, that's not funny.
What are you going to do when your grandfather dies for real?
Just because you didn't study for a test doesn't mean you can go killing off your family.
Who's next?
Your father, your mother?
Why don't you kill your sister or your brother?
He's telling the truth.
Oh, Chris...
Wait... you believe him?
- Of course.
- And not me?
Well, Chris, your grandfather died.
You might say anything.
What are you even doing here?
Bring me your paper.
Don't worry about the test.
You're excused.
In honor of my grandfather, I should have hit her with a brick.
Hi, Mama.
You look good.
And that's my grandmother, Maxine.
She was the only woman who could out-snob my mother.
Your hair smells funny.
Are you still using that cheap perm?
Dark and Lovely?
Look at mine.
It's beautiful.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Good to see you too, Mama.
That's my Aunt Charlotte, but we called her Grievey, because we only saw her at funerals.
No birthdays, no weddings.
Just funerals.
Girl, I haven't seen you since Cheryl's funeral.
I know, I know, I know...
Grievey, stop crying.
Come on.
- Okay, okay, let me go.
- Grievey!
Come on, come on.
Come on.
That's Aunt Mousey.
We called her that because she talked like a mouse and she only spoke when spoken directly to.
Hi, Aunt Mousey.
How you doing?
- Fine.
- Huh?
My Uncle Michael was almost 40 and never had a job.
He put the "um" in "bum."
- How you doing?
- Hey, sis, how you doing?
- Good.
- Y'all got something to eat?
Yeah, we just...
I think he saw a job chasing him.
Hey, Shaft.
That's too bad about your grandpa.
Sorry.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I mean... who's going to teach you how to tap dance now?
Later that day, he beat up a Chinese kid in my honor.
- Oh, here you are.
- Hey, everybody.
Hey, everybody.
Good to see you.
I'm going to, uh, take Michael and Charlotte upstairs to get situated.
- Are you okay, Mousey?
- Fine.
Okay.
Um, come on, upstairs, follow me.
Julius, shouldn't you be at work already?
Hey, you know I'm on my way.
I just came by to say hi real quick.
- How are you?
- Well as can be expected.
You know, Gene and I were married for 40 years.
I hope Rochelle and me make it that far.
The way she keeps this house,
I'm surprised you haven't left already.
My grandmother always criticized everything my mother did.
Mama, you like my coat?
It's all leather.
Oh... feels rubbery.
Feel mine.
Italian leather.
At home, even though my mother seemed to be keeping it together, the house was falling apart.
Rochelle, can you change the channel?
Sure, no problem.
They were treating her like she was me!
Rochelle, you going to help me pick out this casket, or do I have to do it by myself?
Oh, sure, Mama, I'll help you in a minute.
Oh, 'Chellie, get me a glass of iced tea.
Sure, Mama.
Tea for Mom...
- Damn it!
- What?
You ever had the feeling you're about to get smacked upside the head with a yo-yo?
Here, baby.
Be more careful.
You're not mad?
No.
Why would I be mad?
Here, Mama.
This tea tastes funny.
What kind is it?
I think it's Lipton.
Mm-mm, tastes like Nestea.
It's Lipton.
Hey.
Hey.
Want a Turtle?
My mother offering me a Turtle?
In her world, that's a cry for help.
Mm, no thanks.
You okay, Mom?
I'm fine.
You sure you don't want a Turtle?
What was that for?
I just wanted to let you know that I love you.
Since my father was working extra hours and my mother wasn't being herself,
I decided to pick up the slack the best way I knew how.
Tonya, you go make up your bed.
Drew, you clean up in here.
Sitting in here playing cards...
This was going to be harder than I thought.
Turn that mess down!
You trying to make everyone in the house deaf?
Take your feet off the table.
Rochelle, tomorrow, we're going to the funeral home to pick out a casket.
Please dress presentably.
I don't want him to think that we can't afford a decent casket.
Sure, Mama.
- You okay, baby?
You need to sit down?
- Oh, no, I'm fine.
As bad as she felt, I didn't know it was about to get worse.
Rochelle, can't you make a decent glass of iced tea?
Well, can't you leave her alone?
It's iced tea!
If you're thirsty, well, then you drink it!
If you're not, don't!
I might be joining my grandfather sooner than I thought.
Are you going to sit there and let that boy talk to me like that?
Boy, don't you know I'll knock you into another family?
Who are you?
You don't want to know.
Hey, man.
Hey.
Chris... you know you're going to have to apologize to your grandmother.
How come?
She's the one who's been mean to Mom.
She's hurting, Chris, and your mother is, too.
I know you're trying to protect your mother, but trust me, you do not want to get between the two of them.
You ain't gonna win that one.
I'm already going to one funeral.
I ain't trying to go to another one.
Well, then what do I do?
Do what I do: nothing.
Things will work out.
All right?
Apologize.
You can't really believe you're getting married until you buy that tux.
And you can't really believe somebody is dead until you've got to buy them a casket.
Now, we have several models.
This one right over here, top of the line.
Made of mahogany... has silk lining over goose-down bedding... and a night light.
I guess that's in case the dead want to read.
Well, Mama, what about the blue one?
Oh, now, the blue one is nice.
- I don't like it.
- She don't like that one.
It's a coffin, not an Oldsmobile.
I like that one.
Good taste.
Uh, Maxine, that costs a lot of money.
Now, we got payment plans.
Well, can we put it in my father-in-law's name?
Well... no.
I didn't think so.
Okay, Mama, whatever you want.
Oh, okay.
Um, Rochelle, even if we split this five ways, that's still a lot of money.
Who's talking about splitting it?
Well, I just assumed we'd all chip in.
I mean, it is your husband.
Julius, I want to help out.
- What's this?
- It's a baseball card.
Al Oliver.
He played in Pittsburgh.
Lifetime 330 hitter.
That card is going to be worth thousands of dollars someday.
How much is it worth now?
About a dollar.
I got $40 saved up.
What about you, Aunt Mousey?
I have some quarters.
Too bad he won't be playing Asteroids.
Mama, I just don't think that we can afford this right now.
Why not?
Baby, you always bragging about how your husband has two jobs.
I do not.
I do not need this.
My man has two jobs.
My husband has two jobs.
I don't need to be here right now.
I do not need this!
My man has two jobs, okay?
My husband deserves to be buried with dignity.
Now, who are you to deny me that?
Mama, we're not trying to deny you dignity, I mean...
You only die once.
You owe it to your father to let him go in style.
Fine!
Fine!
You do whatever the hell you want.
- Mama...
- Come on!
- Mama, I wasn't trying...
- I'm coming, Mama.
Rochelle, you wrong.
Poor baby.
We'll take the blue one.
My daddy liked blue.
I always hated that picture.
It made me look like I got smacked in the head with a brick.
Oh, hi, Daddy.
You want a Turtle?
No, but how you doing?
I'm okay.
Mama's getting on my last nerve.
Oh, she can do that.
She used to get on my nerves, too.
You know, just because I'm dead doesn't mean you have to let her push you around.
And if she tries to do that, you smack her in the head with that brick.
By the day of the funeral, there was still one thing left to fight over:
who gets to ride in the limo.
Who are you, and what are you doing in here?
Hey, I'm Monay, this is Iisha, and this is Tiki.
We saw the limo so we had to hop in it.
- Where y'all about to go?
- A funeral.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- Who died?
- My husband.
Okay, well, when y'all get back, and if y'all not taking the limo... can we take it to the club?
Okay.
The only thing more crowded than a limo before the funeral is your house after the funeral.
Hey, what are you doing here?
My dad dropped me off to pay my respects.
- Thanks, man.
- He had to go to work.
M ama!
Come look!
Chris has got a white friend.
Michael, close your mouth.
Stop acting like you never seen a white person before.
Hi, honey.
You hungry?
You want something to eat?
- Sure.
- Well, come on.
Want this?
- No, thank you.
- How about a slinky?
Would you like a slinky?
I left a whole load of sloppies in the kitchen for you guys.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
Chris, I got a new video game at the store.
Okay.
Next time someone dies, let me know.
I'll get you a good deal on a casket.
Man, what is your problem?
Sorry about your grandfather, Chris.
The one good thing about losing a family member is that you get lots of sympathy.
What are you doing?
My grandfather died.
Just because your grandfather died doesn't mean you can go around hugging people.
Sorry about your grandfather.
At least somebody was getting some sympathy.
- Who is that?
- I don't know.
Hey, little dude from across the street, here you go, man.
What's this?
I robbed your grandfather a few times.
I didn't know you knew him.
My Turtles.
Who ate my Turtles?
Oh, is that what you call them things?
I ate them, but they was nasty.
What's in those things, anyway?
If you didn't like them, why did you eat them?
Mama, I am sick of you.
Ever since you got here, you have not stopped complaining.
Just because Daddy is dead does not mean that you can come into my house and tell everybody what to do.
And Michael, get your feet off of my damn couch before I slap the jam out of your toes.
Aunt Grievey, stop all that crying.
You cried on Easter.
You cried on Halloween.
You cried on Flag Day.
Get some Kleenex, wipe your nose, 'cause it ain't that damn sad.
And hang up my phone!
And Aunt Mousey, take off your coat and speak up.
You're over there peeping and squeaking.
You sound like a damn rat.
Use your words!
You're damn near 60 years old!
And, Mama, the next time you want to eat my Turtles, the least you could do is like them.
She's back!
Hey.
- Hey, baby.
- How you doing?
I'm fine.
I brought you your Turtles.
Yay, Turtles.
Thank you.
I'm proud of you for standing up to your mother.
You had me worried there for a minute.
Why?
I thought you were about to smack her with a brick.
It's so good seeing you, girl.
- Yes, yes.
- You take care.
You owe me some Kleenex.
See you later, sis;
thanks for all the chicken and things.
All right, and stay out of them pretzels.
Bye.
So...
Did he say anything before he died?
- Who, Daddy?
- No, Martin Luther King.
Yes, your father.
Did he mention me?
No, he just asked for more pork chops.
I know what you're thinking:
"She should have lied."
But actually, the truth was better.
Figures.
I liked the flowers.
You liked them?
I guess so.
I know that doesn't seem like much of an apology after everything that's happened, but here's what she really meant to say.
Baby, I am so proud of you.
I know.
You are doing a wonderful job.
I know!
I wish my no-good son would stand up for me the way your son stood up for you.
I know!
And your father-- oh, he would be so proud of you.
I know!
Well, Mama, why are you so damn mean?
I don't know.
And baby, your hair, it don't stink.
I know.
See you around.
Take care, Mama.
That's all of it.
Oh, thank you, baby.
I'm really going to miss him, Mom.
Me, too, Chris.
Me, too.
Chris, get in here and pick up this yo-yo!
My father died, for goodness sake, and now you're trying to kill me, too!
It was my father's job to pay the bills.
- I'm hungry.
- I'm cold.
I'm hungry and cold.
Eat a piece of cracker.
Your father's coming.
I've got the money.
It was my mother's job to keep the house and the kids in line.
Boy...
Quit leaving your socks all over the place.
Boy, mop the floor.
Girl, clean up the table.
Good job, baby.
As kids we only had one job:
go to school and get decent grades.
Bye, Mommy.
Love you.
Have a good day.
Don't come home stupid.
We won't.
I could usually get a good grade just by talking about Dr. Martin Luther King.
Free at last, free at last.
Thank God Almighty, we are free at last.
In English class...
My book report is on Dr. Martin Luther King.
In history...
My history report is on the Birmingham Bus Boycott led by Dr. Martin Luther King.
The only place Martin Luther King didn't work was in math.
Chris, what's the square root of 144?
1963?
The same year that Dr. Martin Luther King led the March on Washington?
No, it's 12.
All right, class.
Pick up your report cards on the way out and bring them back signed tomorrow.
Oh, no.
What?
I got an F.
Aw, man.
That's rough.
What's your mom gonna say?
I don't know, but it ain't gonna be "Free at last."

Raceman Adapatation:
Sixe
Look at my babies!
Drew, you got a B-plus in gym.
Good job!
You can have whatever you want for dinner.
Really?
Thanks, Mom.
Can I have pork chops and spaghetti?
You sure can.
Yes!
Well, Mom, I got a B in science.
What do I get?
You can have whatever dessert you want.
Uh, ice cream and cake?
Ice cream and cake it is.
Good job, baby.
Boy, don't you see me cooking?
Sorry.
Where's your report card?
They didn't hand them out yet.
I couldn't bring myself to tell my mother I got an F.
Next to dealing drugs, getting bad grades was the worst thing you could do.
It was worse than this.
Tonya, what happened?
Mama, I had to smoke that fool.
Oh, not him.
I'm talking about this D you got in algebra.
And worse than this.
Drew!
Where is that boy?
What the hell is wrong with you?
I'm following my dream, Mama.
I'm gonna be a country and western singer.
I'm not talking about that.
I'm talking about this F.
Now, take your Johnny Cashless ass upstairs and study.
You think I'm playing with you?
And where'd you get that guitar from?
You'd better not be selling no damn drugs in my house.
I didn't know what to do, but I couldn't give her that report card.
- Well, let me know when you get it.
- Yes, ma'am.
Need any help cooking?
Sure.
Thank you, baby.
I figured, if I showed her how useful I could be, she wouldn't kill me when she found out.
While I was trying to figure out what to do about my F, my father was home sick, trying to figure out how he got the gout.
Oh, baby... when did you get the gout?
I don't know.
It just happened.
I know you're probably wondering, what is the gout?
Well gout, or the gout as some people like to call it, is a form of arthritis, which causes severe swelling usually in the ankle or the big toe.
It's caused by a poor diet, including things like... smothered pork chops.
Needs some salt.
Smothered chicken-fried bacon.
Needs some salt.
And smothered chicken-fried bananas.
Not bad.
Needs salt.
Are you out your damn mind?
All right, I'm going to work the phones over at the real estate office today.
Try not to eat any junk.
I'll be home in time to make dinner.
I can't eat that stuff all day.
You can if you want to get rid of the gout.
Give me a kiss.
When are you gonna turn in your report card?
I was thinking, it's so busy that if I didn't say anything,
Miss Morello will just forget about it.
It didn't take much to graduate from my old school.
All you needed was a ride to the graduation.
Who are you?
I was in Ms. Jenkins' class.
Oh.
Here.
Thank you.
Chris, where's your report card?
My mom's been really busy.
I promise I'll have it by tomorrow.
Make sure you do.
Because my father was used to working all the time, staying home was tough.
But at least he got to watch one of his favorite things:
Soap operas.
The Yankees were good, but not better than The Young and the Restless.
At Corleone, if you needed something like a forged report card or a tardy slip, there was one guy that could get it for you, and his name was Fisher.
Hey, Fisher.
Who's this?
Chris.
Tell him I'm not talking to him.
He's not talking to you.
Chris.
- He a friend of yours?
- Yeah.
Pat him down.
- He's clean.
- What does he want?
- I need a new...
- Hey, hey.
- Tell him I'm not talking to him.
- He's not talking to you.
He needs a new report card.
He got an F, but he doesn't want to show it to his mother.
Okay, I got it.
It's a two-part job.
He needs a report card with an A for his mother to sign, and a report card with an F with his mother's signature on it.
- So you'll do it?
- I 'm not talking to him.
He's not talking to you.
So you'll do it?
Okay, let's say I do this for him.
What's he gonna do for me?
What do you want?
How about a book report for English?
Hey, what the hell's the matter with you?
- Don't you see me talking to you?
- Don't you see him talking to you?
- Can it be on Martin Luther King?
- Deal.
Meet me in the science lab storage room at 3:00.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
Hey, look over there.
Hey, Julius.
Uh...
Rochelle's not here.
No, no, no.
Rochelle told me to stop by and check on you.
And I brought you this.
What, a salad?
Yeah, I gotta get back to The Young and the Restless.
You watching The Young and the Restless?
Yeah.
Why?
Usually my father was uncomfortable around Sheila, but not when The Young and the Restless was on.
You think Victor and Nicky are going to stay together?
Sure look so.
It's like they were watching a game.
I think you deserve all for just being my mistress.
Ooh.
I've never had a forged report card before, but Greg told me Fisher was the best.
One time he made such a good fake, they arrested the guy who made the original.
Hey, Ma, I got my report card.
Oh.
Let me see.
I was scared.
Felt like I was giving a fake diamond to Lil' Kim.
An "A" in math?
Chris, this is so great.
You got an "A" in math?
That's right.
So what?
What's three times three?
- Nine.
- What's four times five?
- Twenty.
- What's eleven times eleven?
Shut up.
Can you sign this?
Does John know who Victor slept with?
Oh, he does?
!
J ulius!
Oh, hey, you know, I gotta go.
All right, I'll talk to you later.
Oh, man!
- Who was that?
- Oh, that was Monica.
She was the hairdresser's friend.
She just wanted to know what happened on The Young and the Restless.
Oh, you two were on the phone an awfully long time.
It was a good show today.
Did you know that your son got an "A" in math?
My man!
That must be why your teacher called this afternoon.
Yeah, she wants you to come down to school on Wednesday and talk about Chris's grade.
Will Rochelle find out about Chris' actual grade?
How long will Chris be able to keep up this lie?
Will Julius ever get rid of the gout?
Will Tonya ask Chris more math questions?
Will Drew get any lines?
Find out this and more, when
Everybody Hates Chris returns.
Everybody ha-ates Chris.
Once I got my mother's signature on my report card,
Fischer had what he needed to complete my plan.
What?
I'm a natural.
Now beat it.
Since I had the cards in place, all I had to do was keep my mother and Mrs. Morello from seeing each other and I would be home free.
Chris, do you have your signed report card?
Sure do.
My mother says she won't be able to come to the school tomorrow.
My father has the gout.
Did you say "the gout"?
Yes.
The gout.
I'm concerned about your grade, Chris.
Well, my mom is, too.
She told me I better get a C on my next report card.
And then she...
Well, let's just say it's kind of hard to sit down.
So I guess she's "Young"
and he's "Restless."
Okay, wait, wait.
We're gonna come back tomorrow for the update.
Wait, wait, wait.
So does Victor's ex-wife know about him and Nicky?
Ooh, you know what?
Hey, babe.
How you doing?
What's going on here?
Why didn't you tell us Julius likes The Young and the Restless?
I didn't know.
This is Pam.
You remember Pam.
Good.
How are you?
How long y'all been here?
Oh, about three, four hours.
We're just catching up on the soaps.
Oh, and this is my girl Monica.
Monica, that's Rochelle.
Nice to meet you, Monica.
Why do you look so familiar to me?
You tried to sell me food stamps down by the subway that day.
I thought you said you weren't selling food stamps.
You were selling food stamps?
I wasn't selling no food stamps.
Julius, go get the phone.
You hear the phone ringing.
It rang, like, three times already.
Thank you, baby.
Girl, that gout is making him lose his mind.
Does gout mess with your hearing?
Hello?
Hey, Mrs. Morello.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hold on.
Honey, it's for you.
Where'd they go?
They left, gout boy.
What?
An F?
What happened?
The teacher just told me that Chris got an F.
But he said he got an A.
I can't believe that boy looked me dead in the eye and lied to me.
How you gonna handle this?
Translation:
do you want to kill him, or should I?
Hmm... oh, I know what to do.
Pancakes?
Hey, Mom, we're having pancakes?
No, Chris is having pancakes.
That's my baby's reward for getting an A.
Can I have some pancakes?
Do you get an A?
- I got a B.
- That's not an A.
Can I have some pancakes?
I think my foot's getting better.
I might be able to make it to work tomorrow.
Pancakes are for people who get A's, not for people who get the gout.
Baby, you want anything else?
My A student deserves nothing but the best.
No.
No.
Oh, by the way, my teacher says she won't be able to see you today.
That's okay, baby.
I'll talk to her next time.
You want some butter?
My foot's looking better, don't you think?
Why are you talking about your foot?
Your son has no conscience.
In there eating pancakes like he actually got an A.
If you didn't want him to have the pancakes, what'd you give them to him for?
For him to feel guilty and confess.
But that's okay.
Tomorrow I got something for him.
Baby, let's talk about this.
Come on.
Oh, so now you want to talk to me?
Why don't you just talk to your friends, since you talk to them all the time?
Rochelle, those are your friends.
We were just talking about the soaps.
Are you jealous?
Hell, yeah.
Damn skippy.
How would you feel if you came home and I was sitting there talking to a bunch of your friends about football?
- You like football?
- No, I don't like football.
Julius, you always want to talk to me about bills or the kids.
I just think it would be nice to talk about something else for a change.
You want to talk about the gout?
No!
I don't want to talk about the gout!
So it worked?
Yep.
I told my mother that Miss Morello was busy, and I told Miss Morello that my mother was busy.
That was that, and I'm just glad it's over.
They say when you're about to die your life flashes right before your eyes.
Well, here's what mine looked like.
Dude, you're definitely not in there.
Bye, Chris.
Don't tell any lies when you get to heaven.
Hey, Chris, can I have your comic books?
That's a $2 pair of underwear you're messing up.
Rest in peace Tobby...
Chris.
- Hi, Mom.
- Oh, don't mind me.
I'm just here to watch my brilliant, mathematician son in action.
Miss Morello said it would be okay.
If I could just be cool, maybe everything will be all right.
Today we're doing fractions.
What does three twelfths plus three fourths equal?
Ooh!
Ooh!
Me!
Pick me.
Rochelle.
Chris has an answer.
He got an A.
That's right.
He did get an A.
If I could drive, I'd do this.
I don't know the answer.
No?
Well, how is that possible?
You're the math wiz.
The human calculator.
You got an A.
I actually got an F.
This must be how Marion Barry felt when that tape got out.
Miss Morello, thank you for your time.
Come on, Chris.
See you later, Stymie.
Ma, I can explain.
Okay.
Go ahead.
- For real?
- Yeah.
Explain this.
Okay.
I was afraid you'd get mad at me for getting an F.
I thought I could do better next semester, so I changed my grade, forged your signature onto the report card and gave it to Miss Morello.
I thought you wouldn't find out.
"I thought you wouldn't find out."
Boy, what do I look like, Boo-Boo the Fool?
You're running around here lying, forging my signature.
Have you lost your mind?
Look, Chris, if you lie you steal, if you steal, you kill, and I am not getting your behind out of jail.
Chris... if you would have put this much effort into passing the class in the first place, you wouldn't be in this mess.
I am very upset that you failed that class, but I'm more upset that you lied to me.
You are not stupid, Chris.
Don't act like it.
Remember, I bought you in this world, I'll take you right out.
You understand me?
Yes, ma'am.
All right.
Now bring your behind home.
My mother had a funny way of making me feel like the smartest idiot in the world.
Wait, that's it?
No, you better bring that grade up, or I'm gonna slap the wax out your ears.
After I got caught, my parents finally had something to talk about.
What happened with Chris today?
Oh, I got it all handled.
How's your foot?
It's all right.
Got a surprise for you.
I watched your soap today.
Yeah?
Yeah, but if you don't feel like talking...
No, no, no, no.
We can talk about it.
Oh.
Did you know that Nicky was a stripper?
A stripper?
Mm-hmm.
Does Victor know?
He does now.
Things always worked out best in my house when everybody did their job.
And after being more embarrassed than I'd ever been in my life, all I had to do was one more thing.
Mom, I got my report card.
A D!
My baby got a D.
And you're happy about that?
I'm just happy I don't have to smack the chap off your lips.
These ladies love the light.
Love it!
Don't you, eh?
- Yeah, of course you do.
- All right there, Prince Charles.
Calm down.
Tell you what, there's a lovely stink in here.
Thanks.
Nice of you to say so.
Do you know, Moz, I could happily spend the rest of my day up here tending these.
It is your wedding day, mind.
You are meant to be at the registry office in 20 minutes.
Aye.
I suppose I better get changed.
Won't do any harm.
You all right, girls?
Are you thirsty?
Are you having a drink?
Is your Troy still coming down?
Nah.
He's electrocuted himself.
He's back at burns unit.
Gonna name a ward after him.
Right.
Now, taxi is due here any minute, you've got the directions to the church, we've both got cigarettes and lighters, and I've got the, um...
The...
-What?
-The ring!
I've got the ring!
No, I've got the ring.
Now you've got the ring.
Here, do you mind handling these out to the guests?
Have I got to?
Am I not gonna be a bit busy being your best man?
Did you grow these in your allotment?
Nah.
The bloke on the one next to me grew them for us to make up for turning me down to be the best man.
Oh, did he?
Shit, taxi's here.
I mean, great, taxi's here!
Hey, matey, chill out.
You know, whenever I get stressed,
I just think about the vegetables and how they let themselves grow.
Organically if necessary.
So, you know, I just think, "What would a vegetable do in this situation?"
And what would a vegetable do in this situation?
Lie back and enjoy the fertiliser.
Derrick, that is meaningless.
I can't believe you've managed to bag a lovely lass like Yoko.
I mean, you spend all day working with manure, all your clothes stink of manure and you talk manure.
Might put that in me speech, actually.
Ah, Judith.
If only you didn't have sex with corpses, you'd be me ideal woman.
Colin!
I thought you were supposed to be at Derrick and Yoko's do.
Yeah, just come to score some weed first.
I'm on probation.
Yeah, I sensed that.
That's why I come back.
Everyone down at reception going on at us the whole time.
"You got any gear?" "Can you do us an eighth?" "I'll French kiss you for a sixteenth."
-Really?
-Yeah.
Well, you know what Brian's like.
So I thought I'd come back, get some stock, make a killing.
Eh!
I could be like your sidekick, you know, in case anyone makes any fuss.
"All right, you knob!
Don't make me kung-fu your head off!"
Col, I'm selling them weed, not stealing their dinner money.
I don't care who that is, I'm going straight back down that do.
Cartoon Head.
Who's your friend?
Right, Steve's took the car off.
Let's get her inside.
Oh, no.
No, you haven't.
-Please tell me you haven't!
-Yeah.
We've kidnapped him.
Oh wow!
Kidnapping is pretty cool, innit?
What?
Innit?
No?
I thought it was.
-Take him away.
I don't want him here.
-Shall I phone Stemroach?
So you can tell him personally that you're backing out of your agreement?
-No.
He can stay.
-Wise move, Morris.
Bloody hell!
-It's me bleeding landlord!
-He's a lot of people's landlord.
-Worth a fair few million, is that lad.
-You can't keep him here.
It's Mr. Rupani!
You can't hold a man hostage in his own property.
It's immoral!
Is someone gonna tell me what the fuck is going on?
Who is she?
What have you brought her for?
We didn't mean to.
It is escort girl.
They were handcuffed.
I couldn't find a key, but we had to get out of there.
Well, your foolproof plan's off to a roaring start, innit?
It'll be all right.
Me and Cartoon Head are in control.
In control?
It's a bloody mess, Paul!
What about Colin?
He knows what we're doing now.
He's...
He's seen too much.
I haven't.
I haven't seen too much.
I've seen nowt.
You know me, mate, on probation.
Rupani is gonna guess where he is.
- Come on Paul, let's rethink this.
- Oi!
Psycho Paul doesn't rethink.
I parked the car.
I've got the bolt cutters, just like you said.
Has anything happened?
Have I missed anything?
Well, I've got a millionaire landlord handcuffed to a Spanish call girl in me vestibule.
-Apart from that, nowt to report.
-Hey, he might be able to identify
-(IN DEEP VOICE) our voices.
-No, he's got '80s Mega Hits playing on the iPod.
It's a bit bust, mind.
It's stuck on Total Eclipse of the Heart.
Right.
You're coming with me.
There you go, mate.
Seat silent.
-What's happening with her?
-STEVE:
She's dead fit, isn't she?
Hey, maybe we could have a bit of a laugh with her.
A laugh?
She's an angry Spanish girl.
That's nobody's idea of fun time.
-I've never met a Spaniardess before.
-Oi!
Deirdre Barlow!
Zip it!
-I don't need to hide.
I've not done owt.
-You're on probation.
Get in.
-Oh!
-All right, matey.
Derrick, isn't the groom supposed to be at the reception?
I've just come too pick up our stuff for the honeymoon, and I brought you some stuffed squid.
I hate squid.
I don't eat anything that's got more legs than 2,5 chicken.
-You gotta get this in the fridge.
-Derrick!
Derrick!
Stay there, I'll do it.
Well, I'll just get me holdall.
Sorry.
I didn't realise you'd pulled at the reception.
Fast mover, eh?
Ah yeah, you know.
Early one catches the birds.
Gonna get up to some funny stuff, eh?
A bit of light bondage.
You know, nothing too heavy.
You go for it, matey.
I sometimes attach clothes pegs to me scrotal sac.
Right.
Smashing.
-Hiya.
-This is an unexpected pressure.
Not selling pegs, are you?
You're gonna let us in or what?
Why's everyone coming here?
They want some hash.
Yasuko wants Derrick.
And I want to sit down.
You're supposed to be the best man.
Show some responsibility.
-Hello, Moz.
You okay?
-Yeah.
Congratulations, Mrs Derrick.
Moz, Jim.
Jim, Moz.
-All right?
-Hi.
Nice to meet you.
In't he scrummy?
-DERRICK:
Hello, wife.
-Hello, anata.
Now, that is true love.
- Right.
I'm gonna put my feet up.
- Oh no, I've just tidied.
Hang on...
I see making the bed's still beyond you.
Just get my ciggies, will you?
What happened to you?
I thought you were picking us up some hash.
Been busy.
I'm the best man, I've been doing all... best things.
Thirty notes, ta.
Oh, could you get this?
I've come out without me purse.
-And me.
-Um, yeah.
Course.
-You and China together, then?
-Mmm.
Just taking things as they come.
Yeah, well, they'll come and they'll go.
-Hey, Morris, fancy a toot?
-At a time like this?
Aye, go on.
Blimey.
You said a line.
It's more like the equator.
Right.
I've called his missus.
So in twc hours time, we're gonna swap Rupani for a shed load of cash.
Nice.
Nice.
Nice for you.
Hi, Judith.
Weren't you going to invite me to your party, then?
It's not a party.
Funny.
It's got a party feel.
What with the drinking and the dancing, celebrating.
It weren't planned.
People just kept arriving.
Come in.
Actually, I wish everybody'd leave.
- Sorry, um, should I leave or come in?
- Stay, stay.
If I'm flapping like flares in a hurricane it's because someone has just given us a big line of Charlie.
Right.
Um...
So you won't be peckish for my biscuits, then?
Yeah.
I ate them hours ago.
What?
You ate all of them?
-You did read my note.
-What note?
I put magic mushrooms in them.
Quite a big lot.
Sorry.
Well...
Well, that's okay.
It's been a while, but I should be able to handle it.
Maybe 100.
-So basically I've just eaten a field full of fungus.
-Sorry.
You'll probably be fine.
Yeah.
Course I will.
I mean, what have I got to worry about?
Is there anyone there?
Can you please remove these earphones?
I cannot cope with Total Eclipse of the Heart any more.
Jesus, it's Terry Waite FM.
It's starting again!
Please!
Hey Moz, you got summat to eat?
I'm on probation.
Ask Psychedelia Smith here.
You all right there, C.H.?
All right there, Col?
I couldn't bum a fag off you, could I?
Ah, go on then.
Just take one, mind.
On probation.
Hi.
Hi.
You're Brian?
Looking well.
You all right, Moz?
Hello, Moz.
Are you all right, Moz?
You look a bit...
Squid make me happy.
All right?
Who are you, then?
Um, me?
Why?
Who are you?
I'm Steve.
I'm a criminal.
Um, I'm Judith.
- I'm, um, not.
- Nice one.
Do you wanna go out... with me?
Why?
Where are you going?
-Troy FM!
-Hello?
Hello?
This week's competition question.
Where am I?
Can someone please tell me where I am?
Please!
Come on, it'll be fine.
I can't just dump her without telling her.
-It's rude.
-She's gonna dump you, anyway,
-'cause I heard her saying.
-Honest?
It's a dog-dump-dog world.
Come on.
-See you, Moz.
-See you, Moz.
Moz, are you okay?
Well?
Do you want to sleep with me, Moz?
- I like your bruise.
It's very De Niro.
- Is it?
Okay.
-This is Jim.
-Hi, mate.
You all right?
Isn't he scrummy?
He's on probation.
-What?
-Yeah.
I'm on probation.
-I'm on probation!
-No way!
Yeah.
Third time.
Third time?
Same as.
-No way.
-Yeah.
- Cool.
- Yeah, cool.
Yeah, cool.
Straight from the fridge.
So, who fancies a probation sandwich?
I'm not bumming you.
We'll find someone drunker.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-Nicki, I've been wanting to see you for ages.
-Tada!
Look, if you're in possession of my baby, I at least want a say in what happens to it.
What makes you so sure it's yours?
What'd you do, tag your sperm?
It's either mine or Moz's.
Is that right?
Well, it might interest you to know that there's another possibility.
Oh.
I see.
Blimey, it's a right lottery.
Still, you gotta be in it to win it.
Well, you might have been in it, but you're not going in it again.
I don't know who got me pregnant, but this baby's future is up to me.
Shit.
Hi, Moz.
Been standing there long?
Moz, what did you hear?
You're alright, love?
Sorry, love, I only speak English and advanced Japanese.
-Where is this place?
-It's Moz's flat.
You came here from the reception, do you not remember?
No.
I don't remember nothing.
Hey, I like your bracelet.
-Do I know you?
-Uh, yeah, I'm your boyfriend.
Colin.
Listen, Moz, this is deadly serious.
Why have you gone all Edwardian on my ass?
Moz,
-are you tripping?
-Yeah.
Mushrooms.
Fella, I'm mashed.
I didn't know what I were doing when I were doing it, otherwise I wouldn't have done it.
Look, you need to straighten up.
-This is really important.
-We're off, Morris.
The pleasure's been all...
Pleasure.
All right, lads.
Who's this, then?
Just a mate.
It's his stag do.
We're having a bit of a laugh with him.
-Do you want one of me handcuffs?
-Nah, we're sorted, ta.
Gotta go pick up some cash.
Hang on a sec.
-What?
-Cashpoint.
End of the street.
It's out of order.
The next nearest one's...
All-night garage.
Right.
Ta.
See you, then.
Now, listen.
This is important.
So, that's what I think we should do.
What's what we should do?
What I just said.
-When?
-Just then.
What did you say?
Are you not listening?
I was trying to listen.
I just...
I think I might have been dancing.
Pull yourself together or you are going to cop it.
You are a cop it.
Now, listen.
This is important.
Hang on, give us a sec.
I'll just... engage me core.
Right, okay.
I'm good.
I'm good.
We've got to clear out the hydroponics.
Get rid of every last bit of hash and weed.
Why?
You're gonna be busted.
Day after tomorrow, 6:00 in the morning.
They're gonna take you up the unawares.
They're gonna seize everything.
-The police, is it?
-Yes, the police.
They stumbled across it by accident when they were tailing Cartoon Head.
They reckon he was invovled in something dodgy.
Cartoon Head.
Imagine.
I know.
I told'em.
I keep an eye on C.H. I've seen nowt suspicious.
Anyway.
They installed cameras.
-What, they've been filming us?
-It's okay, it's okay.
The camera's never worked.
- Problem is, one of the lads saw in loft.
Shit!
But if we clear away any evidence, there's nowt they can do.
So I'll be round tomorrow, help you clear everything out.
Okay, fella?
Yeah.
Thanks, fella.
-You cool, then?
-Yeah.
I'm pretty cool.
-You've gone again, haven't you?
-Oh, bloody hell.

Help me.
SPORTSCASTER:
Jim Spencer-- very little gain...
You are so bad, you suck.
JULIE:
So let me get this straight.
They played this game last Sunday?
Yeah.
You've run the same draw play five times for minus three yards.
And you already know who won?
And I got the two grand to prove it.
Okay, a little play action.
Roll out, pass and touchdown!
I never doubted you, baby.
So why are you watching this?
Research.
Arnie, give me two dimes on Carolina, and I'll buy the half point.
Right.
(sighs)
So how's that Longfellow term paper coming along?
I get it back tomorrow.
I'm sure you nailed it.
It's all about doing your homework.
And breaking the law.
Massaging the law.
Hey, I only use Arnie when I can't get to Vegas.
Oh, I'm sure a judge would be fine with that.
I'll give up my bookie when you agree to pay for Stanford on your own dime.
(phone ringing)
Oh...
Speak to me.
WOMAN:
There was three of them.
They took me into a room... and grabbed my throat.
I-I tried to scream, but they held me down, started ripping off my clothes.
I fought back, but they were too strong.
Sydney, can you identify these men?
They're football players.
I've...
I've seen two of them before.
I don't know their names.
But I know the third one.
STARK:
Josh Carpenter?
She's positive it was him.
He's the top college quarterback in the country.
So he can't be a rapist?
Did I say that?
STARK:
Enough!
Game plan?
Let's bring in every guy who was there, get Sydney Blair to ID her attackers.
You want to pull an entire football team out of bed for a lineup?
Just the ones who were at the party.
It'll give us a chance to question
Josh Carpenter without a lawyer present.
That's borderline illegal.
And yet...
I like it.
Looks like the word's out.
Something tells me CU's about to blow their perfect season.
Only if we nail these guys.
Who they play on Saturday?
Arizona.
Arnie, Stark.
Yeah, give me five dimes on Arizona Saturday.
Just a hunch.
We'll nail 'em.
It's a lock.
REPORTERS (clamoring):
Mr. Stark, Mr. Stark...

Just take your time, Sydney.
Sorry, I don't...
I don't see them.
(beeping)
Look, I can't do this.
I know this is hard.
No, I want to go home.
And you will, but these guys hurt you.
And if you don't help us now, they're gonna hurt somebody else.
And I know you don't want that.
Okay?
You can do this.
Okay.
Number two.
And number five.
You sure?
Yeah.
Yeah, they raped me.
MAN:
Did you see Miss Blair at the party tonight, Josh?
No, sir.
It was pretty crowded.
I was just partying with some friends.
Sydney ID'd the other two suspects as Seth Taylor and Brent Freeman.
This guy's lawyer's on his way up.
Did you get a name?
Ted Jeffries.
Party's over.
INVESTIGATOR:
Were you aware of anything that might have been...
STARK:
I'm sorry to interrupt, Detective Frye.
I just have a few questions to ask...
Stark, you're out of line.
You know, I get that a lot.
Who raped Sydney Blair tonight, Josh?
How should I know?
Did you, Taylor and Freeman take her into that room?
No.
She teased you a little bit, you lost control and you raped her?
That's not true.
I know.
You're the leader, you're the quarterback, you spot Sydney, she's looking hot.
You call in a few of your blockers, then you go to town.
That's not what happened.
If you're lying...
I will find out.
So, if you have something to tell me, son, now's the time.
Don't say another word.
Oh, hey, Ted, I was wondering when you'd show up.
You arresting my client?
Hey, this is a preliminary investigation.
It'd save us a lot of time and effort if he'd just confess now, let us all go to bed.
I got a better idea.
Arrest him or let him go.
Come on.
And if you want a DNA sample, make a motion.
(sighing)
Great.
Now we lost his DNA.
I don't know how to lose.
You just take this bad boy to the lab, and you let me know when you get the results.
And I'll give you the name of my tailor, 'cause those lapels went out with disco.
MAN:
Thanks for seeing me, Jessica.
And I assure you that all university resources are at your disposal.
I appreciate that, Ben.
Sorry, I didn't have a chance to meet Mr. Stark.
Count your blessings.
You know, um, I'd never ask you to compromise your position,
Jessica, but the university
PR department's driving me crazy.
If you could give me any indication as to where this is headed...
Downhill, fast.
Mr. Stark, I presume?
Sorry, I'm late.
Not that it matters since the district attorney can't discuss an ongoing case with an interested party.
Right, Jess?
The chancellor and I were just wrapping up.
I was hoping we could work together.
Well, that presumes our interests are the same, which clearly they're not.
You're trying to protect the university's million-dollar meal ticket.
I'm trying to prosecute a gang rape.
I'm sorry, Ben.
I'm not.
Your boys are going down.
I came to discuss a strategy for managing the avalanche of publicity to the benefit of all concerned.
At least to you.
Dr.Flynn feels the less press, the better.
Hmm, what a shock.
I wonder why.
Oh, maybe it's those big fat TV dollars at stake, alumni contributions, lost recruits...
Now, that's unfair.
The university wants justice done in this matter.
Oh, you're in luck, Ben.
I happen to be in the justice business.
Okay, let's break it down.
Victim attends a victory party at the defendant's on-campus residence.
She arrives at 9:00, has some drinks.
Find out how many.
Carpenter, Freeman and Taylor take her to a room downstairs make sexual advances;
victim says no, they won't listen.
When the guys go back upstairs to the party, victim runs outside, calls the campus police.
So what's the good news?
Torn clothing, bruising, overwhelming evidence of forced intercourse but here's the headline--
Josh Carpenter's DNA found inside the victim.
Oh, there goes the Heisman.
Bad news?
According to witnesses, she was inebriated, she was seen flirting with the suspects, and she went into the room willingly.
But the law is clear.
None of that constitutes consent.
STARK:
Trials aren't about the law.
If Casey bumped on it, then the jury may, too.
So, we attack it on direct.
Portray her as an unsuspecting teenaged victim.
The problem is that it's he said, she said.
And he is a star quarterback who will be starting in the NFL next year.
Which means our case is based entirely on Sydney's credibility.
Jules?
Um, I'm sorry to interrupt.
I need to talk to you.
What?
I got suspended.
They're accusing me of plagiarism on my Longfellow paper.
They say I stole it off the Internet.
That's insane!
Well, there's this Web site and it's got all kinds of stuff.
It's got essays and outlines and old papers.
And now I have to face the disciplinary review board.
And... if... if they find that I'm guilty,
I'm going to get expelled, Dad.
No, don't worry, that is not going to happen.
Yeah, but this is going to destroy everything I've worked for, Dad.
And Mom...
Mom is going to kill me.
Jules...
Jules, take a breath.
(exhaling)
Now, who do I talk to?
Uh, Vice Principal Saunders is in charge of the review board.
I want you to collect every note you took, every quote you cited, everything.
and have it waiting when I get home.
(sighs)
I promise... everything's going to be okay.
Witnesses saw Sydney on the dance floor around midnight.
Apparently she was doing her share of watermelon shots.
Drinking is not against the law, unlike sexual assault.
I think it's down here.
This is where it happened.
They call this place the rec room.
No clocks, no windows, buried in the basement... it's the perfect place for rape.
Or for studying.
What's your problem?
Teammate of mine in college broke up with this girl.
She freaked out, accused him of date rape.
Almost didn't graduate.
That sucks.
It also has nothing to do with this case.
Sydney Blair was raped.
I suggest you wrap your head around that and do your job.
I'm going to go look around.
Whoa!
You're early.
Strippers don't start till 10:00.
I heard steroids shrink your genitals.
Apparently, they have the same effect on the brain.
I'm Deputy DA Madeleine Poe.
Any of you attend the party here Saturday night?
Any criminal justice majors?
You might want to reread the chapter on obstruction of justice.
We already spoke to the cops.
I've read your statements.
There were at least 25 of you down here, and yet none of you saw Sydney Blair go into the rec room with your teammates.
Loyalty's an admirable trait.
Covering for rapists is a crime.
If any of you suddenly grow a conscience, my number's on the card.
Nelson, you got a second?
How do you know my name?
Your number's on your shorts.
I've got a team roster.
Starting receiver as a freshman-- that's impressive.
I've got to get to practice.
According to your statement, you saw
Sydney Blair here Saturday night.
Yeah.
But I didn't see what happened.
You seem like a decent guy, Nelson, and I know it's tough to do the right thing here.
Do it anyway.
What's the buzz on campus?
Typical code of silence.
Where are we on the arrests?
Warrants have been issued for all three suspects,
Freeman and Taylor have retained separate counsel, and I'm waiting on a call from Jeffries to arrange a self-surrender for Josh Carpenter.
Why are we cutting pretty boy any slack?
The more public his arrest, the better chance he'll cave to protect future endorsements.
Private arrest gives us less chance of a media backlash.
Well, shockingly, you're both right.
Let's pick up all three on the down-low.
Keep Carpenter's million-dollar smile off camera as long as we can.
We may be a little late on that.
JEFFRIES:
Josh Carpenter is a great talent.
He's also a fine young man.
The D.A.'s office has levied charges that are completely baseless.
REPORTER:
Is it true an arrest warrant has been issued for your client?
Josh offered to surrender voluntarily.
The D.A. clearly wants to humiliate him.
They should be ashamed of themselves.
So much for the down-low.
Okay, I want ten LAPD officers over at the CU campus in one hour.
Now, it would be completely unprofessional to anonymously tip every crime reporter in town about the big arrest that's about to go down at CU.
Got it.
It would be even worse to get Stu Gates over at KCEI on the phone using the personal cell number that I just happen to have here on my Treo.
Check.
Jeffries wants to play games?
Let the games begin.
...awaiting the fate of Heisman hopeful Josh Carpenter.
The LAPD entered the sports complex only moments ago.
Sources inside the D.A.'s office say arrests are imminent.
Reporting live, I'm Tom Phillips,
Channel 8 News, Los Angeles.
Ready.
Showtime.
Stu Gates, KCEI.
Mr. Stark, why are you sneaking these suspects out?
We're protecting their right to privacy, Stu.
Is that Josh Carpenter under there?
Uh... no comment.
I'm sorry.
Care to comment on Ted Jeffries' claim that this is a witch hunt?
You know, a young woman was raped.
And, despite defense counsel's attempt to turn this into a media circus, we intend to pursue justice in a dignified and professional manner.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Well, there you have it.
An uncharacteristically media shy Sebastian Stark plays a by-the-book prosecution in the CU rape case.
Reporting live for KCEI News, I'm Stu Gates.
This just in.
I'm too good.
Hey, so when can I go back to school?
I went through everything, including the school's plagiarism policy, and I have a meeting with this Saunders guy, but you can't go back to class until after the review.
In the meantime, I look guilty.
I'm really sorry, Jules, but I promise you, this is my top priority.
I won't let you down.
Well, what about your case?
This is more important.
Aren't you going to ask if I did it?
I don't need to.
JUDGE:
Preliminary hearing,
State v. Carpenter, Taylor and Freeman.
Ted Jeffries representing
Josh Carpenter, Your Honor.
Vivian Anderson for Seth Taylor and Brent Freeman.
Mr. Stark, ready to proceed?
Yes, Your Honor.
The State calls Detective Gordon Frye.
Your Honor, the defense will stipulate to Detective Frye's statement.
Well, then, the State requests this matter be held over for trial, Your Honor.
Affirmative defenses, Mr. Jeffries?
Yes, Your Honor.
I call Josh Carpenter to the stand.
I do.
Josh, were you at the campus athletic house on the night in question?
Yes.
I live there.
Did you see the alleged victim, Sydney Blair?
Yes.
Do you know Ms. Blair?
I know Sydney very well.
In fact, the two of you were involved in a relationship.
Is that correct?
Kind of.
I have a girlfriend, but Sydney and I had been seeing each other for a few months.
Objection.
No foundation.
Overruled.
JEFFRIES:
Josh, can you explain why your DNA was found inside Ms. Blair?
Because we had sex.
The night of the party?
No.
That morning.
In her apartment.
So Sydney Blair isn't just a girl you met at a party.
She's someone with whom you routinely engaged in consensual sex.
Yes.
Well, that changes everything.
STARK:
So Josh Carpenter didn't rape you?
No.
But everything else happened just like I said.
You lied to us.
Your false accusation is now admissible.
What jury is ever going to believe you?
We can rebuild her credibility.
Not even I am that good.
Now, you got ten seconds to tell me the truth or I am going to drop the rape charges, and I am going to prosecute you for lying to the cops.
I thought if I told you the truth about me and Josh, then you wouldn't believe that I was raped.
That explains why you left out the consensual sex, not why you accused him of rape.
Five seconds.
What do you want me to say?
Nothing.
Time's up.
No.
I don't know why I lied.
I don't know why I lied.
Josh and I met three months ago.
He needed help studying for a history exam.
I never met anybody like Josh before.
He... he could have any girl he wanted, and the fact that he was even interested in me blew my mind.
We never went on any dates, really.
I mean, he would... he would call and... and tell me that he wanted to come over and...
I know he was using me, but I didn't care.
I was in love with him.
What happened that morning?
After we had sex,
I told Josh I wanted a real relationship.
He got mad.
He said that he had an image to uphold.
He said that I was a decent booty call, but that he could never be seen in public with me.
Why did you go to the party?
To get him to change his mind.
Josh wouldn't go near me.
And that's when the two guys came up to me, and they asked me if I wanted to party with them.
What does that mean, party with them?
I was angry, and... confused.
(sobbing)
So I went downstairs.
I was just trying to make Josh jealous.
I swear to you, I never wanted anything to happen.
I just wanted the pain to go away.
And instead, I made it so much worse.
(sobbing)
So how do we win?
Our victim accused an innocent man of rape.
Game over.
The physical evidence is overwhelming.
Did you ever consider that this girl had a really bad night, took on two guys, then blew the whistle when things got a little too rough?
Isn't "rape" a synonym for "things got a little too rough"?
No.
Not when the sex is consensual.
No, it isn't.
She's telling the truth.
I know it.
I love the arrogance, really, but you've been out of law school for roughly ten minutes.
This one's a loser.
If we believe a crime has been committed, it's our duty to prosecute.
With liberty and justice for all.
It's over.
Drop the charges.
No!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I missed the coup.
I said we're done.
You also said, "Trial is war.
Second place is death."
So?
So...
I'm too young to die.
Sydney Blair was raped by Brent Freeman and Seth Taylor.
Just give me one day to prove it.
Dismiss the charge against Josh Carpenter.
Find out every detail of Sydney's life.
I mean, from the point of conception.
Find a way to discredit Taylor and Freeman.
You've got 24 hours to live.
Make them count.
Thank you for meeting me, Nelson.
How's Sydney?
How do you think?
Did you know she was seeing Josh Carpenter?
No, but I'm not surprised.
Look, that guy's a serious player.
Keeps track of how many girls he's had.
Calls it his completion percentage.
That's charming.
He's a scumbag.
He's also the only shot we have at a national championship.
If you could live with that, you wouldn't be here.
What do you want from me?
The truth.
What did you see that night?
I was downstairs.
I saw Seth and Brent take Sydney into the rec room.
Did you hear anything?
Screaming?
Sounds of a struggle?
Music from the party was too loud.
Were you there when they came out?
Sydney ran past me.
She was crying.
Her shirt was ripped.
When Seth and Brent came out, they were laughing.
I need you to come with me to the precinct and amend your statement.
If I do, I risk everything that I've worked for.
And if you don't, I'll throw you in jail and force you to testify.
At least, this way, you can stay on the team.
Let's go.
Julie, I'm home!
EDDIE:
She just got out of the pool.
Julie, there's a half-naked boy dripping in my kitchen!
Um, Eddie Lyndon.
We met, uh...
Yeah.
Eddie the Kissing Bandit.
I remember.
So what do you say we save a little time, and I just kill you now and bury you out in the backyard?
Julie said you were funny.
I also own a gun.
Can I get your legal opinion on something?
I've had a really lousy day.
My brother's friend Craig was arrested for joyriding.
Nobody saw him, but the cops don't care.
The thing is, my brother knows the lady who owns the car.
Stop.
Your brother thinks that if he takes the rap for Craig, the whole things goes away.
Exactly.
Let me get this straight.
You want to take the rap for Julie because you think the school will go easy on you.
This is all my fault.
I gave Julie the name of that Web site.
I was going to use it myself, but she wouldn't let me.
I'm captain of the track team, my mom's on the board, there's no way they'll kick me out.
JULIE:
Forget it.
It's totally sweet, but totally out of the question.
Let me ask you something.
You think Julie cheated?
Of course not, she's way too smart.
I agree-- so let me handle this.
You're a stand up guy, but if I find out you're sleeping with my daughter,
I will kill you-- fair enough?
DEVLIN:
I'm getting major heat to drop this case.
Half the city council are CU alumni.
And they don't want their New Year's trip to the Rose Bowl ruined by something as trivial as gang rape?
Your victim's credibility is trashed.
You're dead in the water.
Sinking fast, not dead.
We found another witness.
Can they verify the attack?
Not exactly.
Exactly how far from "exactly"?
(sighs)
He saw the girl go in the room, he saw her come out crying.
Oh, well, surprised these boys haven't pled guilty already.
Well, he saw the suspects come out laughing.
It still brings us back to a credibility contest, which you lose.
I've been following up on accusations against the players in that house.
DUIs, fights, improper sexual conduct...
Anything on Taylor and Freeman?
Checked with the CU police, apparently most of these complaints are handled by the student/faculty court.
I'll put in a call to Dr. Flynn.
I already did that-- he denied our request to view all cases involving CU players over the past four years.
Told you that gut was a weasel.
I'll get a warrant.
We can't risk the university's lawyers tying us up in court.
You know, I'll speak to Dr. Flynn personally.
He has the right to withhold files pending a court order.
And I have the right to request he reconsider.
(sighs)
FLYNN:
Hmm?
Yeah.
Yes.
Uh, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back.
Uh, what is going on?
My office requested university disciplinary files.
Given the high-profile nature of this case, the university felt that protecting student privacy is paramount.
A student's privacy has already been violated.
He name is Sydney Blair.
Would you have withheld those files if she had been raped by, say, the math team?
How dare you imply...
I'm not implying anything,
I'm telling you right to your face.
You give me those files or I will have you arrested.
You should call the university counsel's office.
Maybe I'll call the L.A. Times.
I'm sure the parents of your female students will be thrilled to read that you condone rape on campus.
Hold on.
What's it going to be, doc?
One more underage drinking bust, I'm going to kill myself.
Yeah, here's one for topless sunbathing.
I miss college.
Whoa, hold on.
In '04, Freeman got picked up by CU police.
What does the report say?
He and Taylor took a girl to the basement, tried to have sex with her, wouldn't let her leave.
Jackpot.
You got a name?
WOMAN:
I was on a college tour with some other kids from my high school.
Brent invited some of us to a party.
I had a few drinks, danced, he seemed cool.
Then what happened, Tandy?
He introduced me to Seth Taylor.
They took me down to this room in the basement.
The rec room?
It's where they raped me.
The file says they tried to have sex with you, there's no mention of rape.
Trust me, it was rape.
I filed a complaint with the university, but they said there wasn't enough evidence.
Why didn't you go to the cops?
I had a scholarship pending.
The day I filed the complaint, it was granted.
I needed the money, so I took the scholarship and I kept my mouth shut.
And I've hated myself ever since.
We all make mistakes, Tandy. MADELEINE:
Can you describe the sexual...
Madeleine, focus, okay?
The two of you have to work together.
Walk us through that night, put the jury in that room.
Make them suffer through it, moment by excruciating moment.
Remember, this isn't a recitation of facts, this is a plea for justice.
Sydney, could you please tell us what happened when the defendants lead you into that room?
At first, we were laughing.
Then Brent started touching my breasts.
I told him to stop, but that's when Seth grabbed me from behind... (voice breaking):
and held me down.
I know this is difficult, but can you tell us what was going through your mind?
It was like a nightmare.
They were on top of me, tearing off my clothes.
I knew what they were doing, but I tried to pretend like it wasn't happening.
They raped me.
No further questions.
Miss Blair, isn't it true you were angry at Josh Carpenter that night?
Yes.
So you went to a party, you had a few drinks and then willingly entered a room with two men you knew wanted to have sex with you?
It wasn't like that.
Were you drinking at the party?
Yes.
Did you willingly go downstairs with my clients, who you openly flirted with?
Yes.
And yet it wasn't like that?
It sounds exactly like that.
Objection.
Withdrawn.
Earlier that morning, you had consensual sex with Mr. Carpenter, correct?
That's right.
And the sex with my clients was consensual as well.
No, they raped me.
But didn't you tell the police Josh Carpenter raped you?
That was a mistake...
No, that was a lie, Miss Blair.
And now you expect this jury to believe you're telling the truth about my clients?
Yes.
Isn't it true you decided to get even with Josh Carpenter by having sex with his friends?
No, that is not...
Josh dumped you.
He broke your heart, and you wanted revenge.
Objection, badgering.
Overruled.
This little performance you're putting on here today, this is all about revenge, isn't it, Miss Blair?
No.
I'm telling the truth.
Really?
And which version of the truth is that-- the one where Josh Carpenter raped you, the one where you lied to the police?
Or is it the version where you were lying before but somehow you're not lying now?
Objection.
Withdrawn.
I appreciate your candor, Miss Blair.
So what's it gonna take to make this go away?
Give me a number.
I'm kidding.
Just a little ice-breaker.
(chuckling)
Had you, huh?
This is an awkward situation, Mr. Stark.
I think the world of Julie.
Well, then why not give her a break?
We both know she didn't do this.
Unfortunately, the evidence against her is strong.
Speaking of the so-called evidence...
Julie's case will be decided by the full review board.
But you run the show.
Which makes any prior discussion of the details inappropriate.
Fine.
But for the record, Julie is completely innocent.
Okay, so if we're not discussing the case, why am I here?
Because I care about Julie.
She's one of our top students and a terrific kid.
I'm just trying to understand how this happened.
How this allegedly happened.
When students exercise poor judgment, often it stems from larger issues.
Drugs, sexual experimentation...
That's crazy.
Forgive me, but from what Julie's told me, you're extremely busy with your legal practice.
So?
It's just that your ex-wife seemed more active in Julie's life.
But she's in New York now.
Exactly.
So with all these changes, it could be that Julie's feeling abandoned.
Whoa.
You are aware the Julie chose to stay in Los Angeles with me?
This is not a personal attack, Mr. Stark.
I'm sure you're doing the best that you can.
I'm perfectly capable of raising my daughter.
I'm sure that you are, it's just that
Julie never had a problem before her mother left.
What is this?
That is a civil suit alleging defamation and slander.
Five million dollars?
No, that's just for starters.
By the time I'm done, this place'll be a Burger King.
Reinstate Julie pending a hearing,
I drop the suit.
Well...
I guess I know how you got your nickname.
And if I were you, I'd take the deal, 'cause during all those years when I was being a lousy, irresponsible father,
I somehow became this bitchin' lawyer.
(chuckles)
Not feeling the love, people.
We're toast.
I read the transcript.
Sydney got torn apart on cross.
Big time.
Not a shock.
But we still have Tandy Parker.
Uh, well, you know, about that.
Please tell me we didn't lose Tandy Parker.
I really wish I could tell you that.
But instead you're going to tell me...
She snuck into the court room and now she's refusing to testify.
STARK:
Can't imagine why.
Oh, maybe the same reason prisoners don't cut in line on their way to the gas chamber.
Well, you guys are right about one thing.
We're definitely toast.
We can subpoena Tandy, force her to testify that Freeman and Taylor raped her.
She'll just deny it.
We're already on thin ice with the jury.
Okay, I may be reaching.
I've been going over the details of Tandy's original statement and she says that she got away from Freeman and Taylor and made a break for the door, but there was someone standing outside.
They used a lookout.
So, two different women were raped by the same two guys at the same location.
If their MO is consistent, that means...
Ladies and gentlemen, we could have an unknown eyewitness.
(indistinct shouting)
What the hell are you guys doing here?
We know you were in the hall when Sydney went into the rec room and when she came out.
So?
If you were involved, now's the time to come clean.
Wait, you think I was part of this?
Look, I tried to help you.
I'm out of here.
Nelson.
I believe you didn't do this.
I just think you know more than you've told me.
I told you everything that I saw.
You didn't tell us about the lookout.
We know that there was someone standing outside that door when Sydney was being raped.
Someone who was making sure that Taylor and Freeman weren't interrupted.
Who was it, Nelson?
Look, don't make me do this.
You know I feel bad about Sydney.
This isn't about Sydney.
One day, this could be your wife or your daughter.
I know...
No.
You don't know.
I know.
When I was 11, we had to live with my aunt in St. Louis and she was seeing this guy, Larry.
Larry was big and handsome, always laughing, playing around, telling jokes, but the joke was on me 'cause one night, handsome Larry came into my room and he got into bed with me.
And this went on for ten months, because I was too scared to say anything.
And then one day, my brother saw us, and he called the cops.
It just takes one person who's not afraid.
Who was the lookout?
It was Josh Carpenter.
There's a special place in hell for Josh Carpenter.
STARK:
But before you call Dante, let's run this thing down.
Nelson Moore's statement puts Carpenter at the scene.
But outside the action.
We could use Carpenter as a material witness against Taylor and Freeman.
He may not be willing to cooperate.
Then we charge him till it hurts.
His false statement to the cops, perjury, obstruction of justice...
We need more.
Ted Jeffries isn't gonna bend over for misdemeanors.
Then let's take our chances with the jury.
Prosecute Josh Carpenter separately as an accessory to rape.
MADELEINE:
He's got no record.
He'll just walk away with a slap on the wrist.
Hmm, no, not necessarily.
In his statement,
Nelson Moore said...
"I approached Josh, asked if everything was cool.
He looked around, said it was and told me to take off."
Okay, so in effect,
Josh Carpenter prevented Nelson from aiding Sydney Blair.
Making him an active participant just as culpable as the others.
Rape in concert-- very creative.
There's just one problem.
Without Carpenter's testimony, no jury will convict these guys of rape.
And without a rape conviction, there's no standing for rape in concert.
(Stark sighs)
Okay, we've got two options.
Plan A, we go after Taylor and Freeman for rape without Carpenter's testimony and then charge Carpenter with rape in concert.
If we're extremely lucky, we nail all three.
If we're not, they all walk.
Plan B:
We use the rape in concert charge to leverage a deal with Josh Carpenter, and then force him to testify against Taylor and Freeman...
Which strengthens our case, but lets a lying jerk go free.
Let's go talk to Sydney Blair.
Wait, I don't understand.
He was outside the door, standing watch.
That can't be true.
I'm afraid it is.
Oh, my God.
I-I mean, I knew Josh was angry, but to stand there and let those animals attack me, I...
Look, our problem is this:
We can't prove that Josh knew what was going on inside that room.
But if we offer him a deal, we can secure his testimony against Taylor and Freeman.
Does that mean that Josh would get away with what he did?
Well, I mean, this has been in the press, it will definitely hurt his reputation and career.
No, that's not what I asked.
It means that Josh won't be prosecuted.
Josh planned this.
He wanted to punish me.
He pointed me out to Brent and Seth, and he watched the door while they raped me!
Please understand this.
If we don't make a deal with Josh Carpenter,
Taylor and Freeman will be acquitted, and no one will pay for what happened to you, Sydney.
I understand.
But Josh Carpenter helped them rape me.
I'm begging you, Mr. Stark.
Don't let him go.
I'm sorry.
Hmm, what was that for?
Getting me back into school.
Well, we still have to deal with the review board.
I know, but it's just nice to be back to the normal routine.
Where you headed?
Uh, Katie and I are gonna go see a movie.
It is a school night.
Yeah?
It just seems like I should know where you're going, probably, just, you know... so I know.
Okay.
It's just that you never really seemed to care that much.
Well, I do.
Okay, so can I go to the movies?
Yes.
Okay, see you later.
Not too late.
Right.
No deal.
A witness put your client at the door during the rape.
Alleged rape, and standing by a door isn't a crime.
It is when you prevent help from entering the room, and you lie to the cops about it.
Then file charges.
Trust me, I would love to.
Fine, this meeting's over.
Josh, you walk out that door,
I will make you regret it for the rest of your life.
JEFFRIES:
Mr. Stark's just bitter.
He hasn't lost in a while.
I'll stuff every petty offense I can dream up into an indictment, and I will splash it across every sports page in the country.
See what that does to your standing in the draft.
Even if you beat every single charge, your reputation is trashed.
Not to mention, you'll be handing over the bulk of your signing bonus to Mr. Jeffries here for his legal fees.
Think about it.
(indistinct whispering)
Josh...
Full immunity.
Sexual misconduct.
18 months, paroled in six, he's out in time for the draft.
You're dreaming.
Ted, he watched a girl get raped.
Without his testimony, you have no case.
Full immunity.
I want the courtroom closed and a gag order on the jury.
(sighs)
I'll draw up the paperwork.
What do you want me to say?
I was pissed off that Sydney came to the party.
I was with my girlfriend.
I didn't want a whole weird scene.
So, what did you do?
I asked Brent and Seth to help me out, and they took her downstairs.
To the rec room?
Yeah.
At first it was cool.
Sydney was having a good time with those guys.
Then she wanted to leave, and you know, they wouldn't let her go.
And you know this how?
'Cause I was at the door... standing guard.
And you're certain what happened in that room was rape?
Yes.
At one point, I could hear Sydney crying.
I opened the door, and...
What did you see?
I saw Seth on top of her, and...
Brent was holding her down.
And he looked at me, and he smiled.
So, what did you do?
Nothing.
Tell me, Josh... what kind of a person sees a young woman being raped and does nothing?
Last question.
Did you ever-- at any time-- consider going inside that room and joining in the rape of Sydney Blair?
Absolutely not.
And why didn't you?
Because I'm not a rapist.
No, right.
You're just a guy who guards the door.
No more questions.
Hey.
Working late?
Just wanted to say, you were really great on this case.
A compliment!
Strictly professional.
The way you got Nelson Moore to cooperate, it was amazing.
Just doing my job.
It was more than that.
You were willing to share this horrible secret so he'd do the right thing.
That took a lot of guts.
Actually, it took a lot of imagination.
I don't have an aunt, I've never been to St. Louis.
I just made it up.
Why would you lie about something like that?
I said what he needed to hear.
You look disappointed.
Of course not.
I guess I thought maybe...
I was starting to understand you a little.
Intimacy's overrated.
You want to grab a drink?
I think I'm gonna pass tonight.
I'm a little tired.
Suit yourself.
Five years apiece for first-degree rape.
And they'll be out in three.
Considering where we started, it's a good verdict.
Except for Josh Carpenter walking away scot free.
Obviously, I'm disappointed that my teammates were involved in something as-as horrible as this.
Josh, can you tell us why you decided to testify?
Well, at the end of the day, I just had to do the right thing.
I say we kick his ass.
Now you're talking.
STARK:
Much as I'd love to see that, and I'm getting aroused just thinking about it, he's not worth it.
The world's not fair, guys.
Just take yes for an answer and move on.
Aren't you gonna say, "I told you so"?
No.
Wise choice.
REPORTER:
Josh, what's your playing status for the rest of the season?
Pretty serious expression.
Just thinking about everything.
(sighs)
You know, from now on, I'm gonna be more involved in your life.
School, hobbies, everything.
I'd really like that.
We're gonna get through this, Jules, trust me.
That review board won't know what hit 'em.
Thank you.
I haven't done anything yet.
Oh, but you have.
Everybody doubted me.
My teachers doubted me, my friends...
I even started doubting myself.
But you were the only one who still believed in me.
And it only took me 16 years to show it.
(sighs)
(voice breaking):
Hey, Dad?
I plagiarized that paper.
* *
(sobbing):
I-I got distracted and ran out of time.
I just downloaded it off the Internet.
I'm so sorry.
(sobbing)
(sighs)

SPORTSCASTER:
Jim Spencer-- very little gain...
You are so bad, you suck.
JULIE:
So let me get this straight.
They played this game last Sunday?
Yeah.
You've run the same draw play five times for minus three yards.
And you already know who won?
And I got the two grand to prove it.
Okay, a little play action.
Roll out, pass and touchdown!
I never doubted you, baby.
So why are you watching this?
Research.
Arnie, give me two dimes on Carolina, and I'll buy the half point.
Right.
(sighs)
So how's that Longfellow term paper coming along?
I get it back tomorrow.
I'm sure you nailed it.
It's all about doing your homework.
And breaking the law.
Massaging the law.
Hey, I only use Arnie when I can't get to Vegas.
Oh, I'm sure a judge would be fine with that.
I'll give up my bookie when you agree to pay for Stanford on your own dime.
(phone ringing)
Oh...
Speak to me.
WOMAN:
There was three of them.
They took me into a room... and grabbed my throat.
I-I tried to scream, but they held me down, started ripping off my clothes.
I fought back, but they were too strong.
Sydney, can you identify these men?
They're football players.
I've...
I've seen two of them before.
I don't know their names.
But I know the third one.
STARK:
Josh Carpenter?
She's positive it was him.
He's the top college quarterback in the country.
So he can't be a rapist?
Did I say that?
STARK:
Enough!
Game plan?
Let's bring in every guy who was there, get Sydney Blair to ID her attackers.
You want to pull an entire football team out of bed for a lineup?
Just the ones who were at the party.
It'll give us a chance to question
Josh Carpenter without a lawyer present.
That's borderline illegal.
And yet...
I like it.
Looks like the word's out.
Something tells me CU's about to blow their perfect season.
Only if we nail these guys.
Who they play on Saturday?
Arizona.
Arnie, Stark.
Yeah, give me five dimes on Arizona Saturday.
Just a hunch.
We'll nail 'em.
It's a lock.

Just take your time, Sydney.
Sorry, I don't...
I don't see them.
(beeping)
Look, I can't do this.
I know this is hard.
No, I want to go home.
And you will, but these guys hurt you.
And if you don't help us now, they're gonna hurt somebody else.
And I know you don't want that.
Okay?
You can do this.
Okay.
Number two.
And number five.
You sure?
Yeah.
Yeah, they raped me.
MAN:
Did you see Miss Blair at the party tonight, Josh?
No, sir.
It was pretty crowded.
I was just partying with some friends.
Sydney ID'd the other two suspects as Seth Taylor and Brent Freeman.
This guy's lawyer's on his way up.
Did you get a name?
Ted Jeffries.
Party's over.
INVESTIGATOR:
Were you aware of anything that might have been...
STARK:
I'm sorry to interrupt, Detective Frye.
I just have a few questions to ask...
Stark, you're out of line.
You know, I get that a lot.
Who raped Sydney Blair tonight, Josh?
How should I know?
Did you, Taylor and Freeman take her into that room?
No.
She teased you a little bit, you lost control and you raped her?
That's not true.
I know.
You're the leader, you're the quarterback, you spot Sydney, she's looking hot.
You call in a few of your blockers, then you go to town.
That's not what happened.
If you're lying...
I will find out.
So, if you have something to tell me, son, now's the time.
Don't say another word.
Oh, hey, Ted, I was wondering when you'd show up.
You arresting my client?
Hey, this is a preliminary investigation.
It'd save us a lot of time and effort if he'd just confess now, let us all go to bed.
I got a better idea.
Arrest him or let him go.
Come on.
And if you want a DNA sample, make a motion.
(sighing)
Great.
Now we lost his DNA.
I don't know how to lose.
You just take this bad boy to the lab, and you let me know when you get the results.
And I'll give you the name of my tailor, 'cause those lapels went out with disco.
MAN:
Thanks for seeing me, Jessica.
And I assure you that all university resources are at your disposal.
I appreciate that, Ben.
Sorry, I didn't have a chance to meet Mr. Stark.
Count your blessings.
You know, um, I'd never ask you to compromise your position,
Jessica, but the university
PR department's driving me crazy.
If you could give me any indication as to where this is headed...
Downhill, fast.
Mr. Stark, I presume?
Sorry, I'm late.
Not that it matters since the district attorney can't discuss an ongoing case with an interested party.
Right, Jess?
The chancellor and I were just wrapping up.
I was hoping we could work together.
Well, that presumes our interests are the same, which clearly they're not.
You're trying to protect the university's million-dollar meal ticket.
I'm trying to prosecute a gang rape.
I'm sorry, Ben.
I'm not.
Your boys are going down.
I came to discuss a strategy for managing the avalanche of publicity to the benefit of all concerned.
At least to you.
Dr.Flynn feels the less press, the better.
Hmm, what a shock.
I wonder why.
Oh, maybe it's those big fat TV dollars at stake, alumni contributions, lost recruits...
Now, that's unfair.
The university wants justice done in this matter.
Oh, you're in luck, Ben.
I happen to be in the justice business.
Okay, let's break it down.
Victim attends a victory party at the defendant's on-campus residence.
She arrives at 9:00, has some drinks.
Find out how many.
Carpenter, Freeman and Taylor take her to a room downstairs make sexual advances;
victim says no, they won't listen.
When the guys go back upstairs to the party, victim runs outside, calls the campus police.
So what's the good news?
Torn clothing, bruising, overwhelming evidence of forced intercourse but here's the headline--
Josh Carpenter's DNA found inside the victim.
Oh, there goes the Heisman.
Bad news?
According to witnesses, she was inebriated, she was seen flirting with the suspects, and she went into the room willingly.
But the law is clear.
None of that constitutes consent.
STARK:
Trials aren't about the law.
If Casey bumped on it, then the jury may, too.
So, we attack it on direct.
Portray her as an unsuspecting teenaged victim.
The problem is that it's he said, she said.
And he is a star quarterback who will be starting in the NFL next year.
Which means our case is based entirely on Sydney's credibility.
Jules?
Um, I'm sorry to interrupt.
I need to talk to you.
What?
I got suspended.
They're accusing me of plagiarism on my Longfellow paper.
They say I stole it off the Internet.
That's insane!
Well, there's this Web site and it's got all kinds of stuff.
It's got essays and outlines and old papers.
And now I have to face the disciplinary review board.
And... if... if they find that I'm guilty,
I'm going to get expelled, Dad.
No, don't worry, that is not going to happen.
Yeah, but this is going to destroy everything I've worked for, Dad.
And Mom...
Mom is going to kill me.
Jules...
Jules, take a breath.
(exhaling)
Now, who do I talk to?
Uh, Vice Principal Saunders is in charge of the review board.
I want you to collect every note you took, every quote you cited, everything.
and have it waiting when I get home.
(sighs)
I promise... everything's going to be okay.
Witnesses saw Sydney on the dance floor around midnight.
Apparently she was doing her share of watermelon shots.
Drinking is not against the law, unlike sexual assault.
I think it's down here.
This is where it happened.
They call this place the rec room.
No clocks, no windows, buried in the basement... it's the perfect place for rape.
Or for studying.
What's your problem?
Teammate of mine in college broke up with this girl.
She freaked out, accused him of date rape.
Almost didn't graduate.
That sucks.
It also has nothing to do with this case.
Sydney Blair was raped.
I suggest you wrap your head around that and do your job.
I'm going to go look around.
Whoa!
You're early.
Strippers don't start till 10:00.
I heard steroids shrink your genitals.
Apparently, they have the same effect on the brain.
I'm Deputy DA Madeleine Poe.
Any of you attend the party here Saturday night?
Any criminal justice majors?
You might want to reread the chapter on obstruction of justice.
We already spoke to the cops.
I've read your statements.
There were at least 25 of you down here, and yet none of you saw Sydney Blair go into the rec room with your teammates.
Loyalty's an admirable trait.
Covering for rapists is a crime.
If any of you suddenly grow a conscience, my number's on the card.
Nelson, you got a second?
How do you know my name?
Your number's on your shorts.
I've got a team roster.
Starting receiver as a freshman-- that's impressive.
I've got to get to practice.
According to your statement, you saw
Sydney Blair here Saturday night.
Yeah.
But I didn't see what happened.
You seem like a decent guy, Nelson, and I know it's tough to do the right thing here.
Do it anyway.
What's the buzz on campus?
Typical code of silence.
Where are we on the arrests?
Warrants have been issued for all three suspects,
Freeman and Taylor have retained separate counsel, and I'm waiting on a call from Jeffries to arrange a self-surrender for Josh Carpenter.
Why are we cutting pretty boy any slack?
The more public his arrest, the better chance he'll cave to protect future endorsements.
Private arrest gives us less chance of a media backlash.
Well, shockingly, you're both right.
Let's pick up all three on the down-low.
Keep Carpenter's million-dollar smile off camera as long as we can.
We may be a little late on that.
JEFFRIES:
Josh Carpenter is a great talent.
He's also a fine young man.
The D.A.'s office has levied charges that are completely baseless.
REPORTER:
Is it true an arrest warrant has been issued for your client?
Josh offered to surrender voluntarily.
The D.A. clearly wants to humiliate him.
They should be ashamed of themselves.
So much for the down-low.
Okay, I want ten LAPD officers over at the CU campus in one hour.
Now, it would be completely unprofessional to anonymously tip every crime reporter in town about the big arrest that's about to go down at CU.
Got it.
It would be even worse to get Stu Gates over at KCEI on the phone using the personal cell number that I just happen to have here on my Treo.
Check.
Jeffries wants to play games?
Let the games begin.
...awaiting the fate of Heisman hopeful Josh Carpenter.
The LAPD entered the sports complex only moments ago.
Sources inside the D.A.'s office say arrests are imminent.
Reporting live, I'm Tom Phillips,
Channel 8 News, Los Angeles.
Ready.
Showtime.
Stu Gates, KCEI.
Mr. Stark, why are you sneaking these suspects out?
We're protecting their right to privacy, Stu.
Is that Josh Carpenter under there?
Uh... no comment.
I'm sorry.
Care to comment on Ted Jeffries' claim that this is a witch hunt?
You know, a young woman was raped.
And, despite defense counsel's attempt to turn this into a media circus, we intend to pursue justice in a dignified and professional manner.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Well, there you have it.
An uncharacteristically media shy Sebastian Stark plays a by-the-book prosecution in the CU rape case.
Reporting live for KCEI News, I'm Stu Gates.
This just in.
I'm too good.
Hey, so when can I go back to school?
I went through everything, including the school's plagiarism policy, and I have a meeting with this Saunders guy, but you can't go back to class until after the review.
In the meantime, I look guilty.
I'm really sorry, Jules, but I promise you, this is my top priority.
I won't let you down.
Well, what about your case?
This is more important.
Aren't you going to ask if I did it?
I don't need to.
JUDGE:
Preliminary hearing,
State v. Carpenter, Taylor and Freeman.
Ted Jeffries representing
Josh Carpenter, Your Honor.
Vivian Anderson for Seth Taylor and Brent Freeman.
Mr. Stark, ready to proceed?
Yes, Your Honor.
The State calls Detective Gordon Frye.
Your Honor, the defense will stipulate to Detective Frye's statement.
Well, then, the State requests this matter be held over for trial, Your Honor.
Affirmative defenses, Mr. Jeffries?
Yes, Your Honor.
I call Josh Carpenter to the stand.
I do.
Josh, were you at the campus athletic house on the night in question?
Yes.
I live there.
Did you see the alleged victim, Sydney Blair?
Yes.
Do you know Ms. Blair?
I know Sydney very well.
In fact, the two of you were involved in a relationship.
Is that correct?
Kind of.
I have a girlfriend, but Sydney and I had been seeing each other for a few months.
Objection.
No foundation.
Overruled.
JEFFRIES:
Josh, can you explain why your DNA was found inside Ms. Blair?
Because we had sex.
The night of the party?
No.
That morning.
In her apartment.
So Sydney Blair isn't just a girl you met at a party.
She's someone with whom you routinely engaged in consensual sex.
Yes.
Well, that changes everything.
STARK:
So Josh Carpenter didn't rape you?
No.
But everything else happened just like I said.
You lied to us.
Your false accusation is now admissible.
What jury is ever going to believe you?
We can rebuild her credibility.
Not even I am that good.
Now, you got ten seconds to tell me the truth or I am going to drop the rape charges, and I am going to prosecute you for lying to the cops.
I thought if I told you the truth about me and Josh, then you wouldn't believe that I was raped.
That explains why you left out the consensual sex, not why you accused him of rape.
Five seconds.
What do you want me to say?
Nothing.
Time's up.
No.
I don't know why I lied.
I don't know why I lied.
Josh and I met three months ago.
He needed help studying for a history exam.
I never met anybody like Josh before.
He... he could have any girl he wanted, and the fact that he was even interested in me blew my mind.
We never went on any dates, really.
I mean, he would... he would call and... and tell me that he wanted to come over and...
I know he was using me, but I didn't care.
I was in love with him.
What happened that morning?
After we had sex,
I told Josh I wanted a real relationship.
He got mad.
He said that he had an image to uphold.
He said that I was a decent booty call, but that he could never be seen in public with me.
Why did you go to the party?
To get him to change his mind.
Josh wouldn't go near me.
And that's when the two guys came up to me, and they asked me if I wanted to party with them.
What does that mean, party with them?
I was angry, and... confused.
(sobbing)
So I went downstairs.
I was just trying to make Josh jealous.
I swear to you, I never wanted anything to happen.
I just wanted the pain to go away.
And instead, I made it so much worse.
(sobbing)
So how do we win?
Our victim accused an innocent man of rape.
Game over.
The physical evidence is overwhelming.
Did you ever consider that this girl had a really bad night, took on two guys, then blew the whistle when things got a little too rough?
Isn't "rape" a synonym for "things got a little too rough"?
No.
Not when the sex is consensual.
No, it isn't.
She's telling the truth.
I know it.
I love the arrogance, really, but you've been out of law school for roughly ten minutes.
This one's a loser.
If we believe a crime has been committed, it's our duty to prosecute.
With liberty and justice for all.
It's over.
Drop the charges.
No!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I missed the coup.
I said we're done.
You also said, "Trial is war.
Second place is death."
So?
So...
I'm too young to die.
Sydney Blair was raped by Brent Freeman and Seth Taylor.
Just give me one day to prove it.
Dismiss the charge against Josh Carpenter.
Find out every detail of Sydney's life.
I mean, from the point of conception.
Find a way to discredit Taylor and Freeman.
You've got 24 hours to live.
Make them count.
Thank you for meeting me, Nelson.
How's Sydney?
How do you think?
Did you know she was seeing Josh Carpenter?
No, but I'm not surprised.
Look, that guy's a serious player.
Keeps track of how many girls he's had.
Calls it his completion percentage.
That's charming.
He's a scumbag.
He's also the only shot we have at a national championship.
If you could live with that, you wouldn't be here.
What do you want from me?
The truth.
What did you see that night?
I was downstairs.
I saw Seth and Brent take Sydney into the rec room.
Did you hear anything?
Screaming?
Sounds of a struggle?
Music from the party was too loud.
Were you there when they came out?
Sydney ran past me.
She was crying.
Her shirt was ripped.
When Seth and Brent came out, they were laughing.
I need you to come with me to the precinct and amend your statement.
If I do, I risk everything that I've worked for.
And if you don't, I'll throw you in jail and force you to testify.
At least, this way, you can stay on the team.
Let's go.
Julie, I'm home!
EDDIE:
She just got out of the pool.
Julie, there's a half-naked boy dripping in my kitchen!
Um, Eddie Lyndon.
We met, uh...
Yeah.
Eddie the Kissing Bandit.
I remember.
So what do you say we save a little time, and I just kill you now and bury you out in the backyard?
Julie said you were funny.
I also own a gun.
Can I get your legal opinion on something?
I've had a really lousy day.
My brother's friend Craig was arrested for joyriding.
Nobody saw him, but the cops don't care.
The thing is, my brother knows the lady who owns the car.
Stop.
Your brother thinks that if he takes the rap for Craig, the whole things goes away.
Exactly.
Let me get this straight.
You want to take the rap for Julie because you think the school will go easy on you.
This is all my fault.
I gave Julie the name of that Web site.
I was going to use it myself, but she wouldn't let me.
I'm captain of the track team, my mom's on the board, there's no way they'll kick me out.
JULIE:
Forget it.
It's totally sweet, but totally out of the question.
Let me ask you something.
You think Julie cheated?
Of course not, she's way too smart.
I agree-- so let me handle this.
You're a stand up guy, but if I find out you're sleeping with my daughter,
I will kill you-- fair enough?
DEVLIN:
I'm getting major heat to drop this case.
Half the city council are CU alumni.
And they don't want their New Year's trip to the Rose Bowl ruined by something as trivial as gang rape?
Your victim's credibility is trashed.
You're dead in the water.
Sinking fast, not dead.
We found another witness.
Can they verify the attack?
Not exactly.
Exactly how far from "exactly"?
(sighs)
He saw the girl go in the room, he saw her come out crying.
Oh, well, surprised these boys haven't pled guilty already.
Well, he saw the suspects come out laughing.
It still brings us back to a credibility contest, which you lose.
I've been following up on accusations against the players in that house.
DUIs, fights, improper sexual conduct...
Anything on Taylor and Freeman?
Checked with the CU police, apparently most of these complaints are handled by the student/faculty court.
I'll put in a call to Dr. Flynn.
I already did that-- he denied our request to view all cases involving CU players over the past four years.
Told you that gut was a weasel.
I'll get a warrant.
We can't risk the university's lawyers tying us up in court.
You know, I'll speak to Dr. Flynn personally.
He has the right to withhold files pending a court order.
And I have the right to request he reconsider.
(sighs)
FLYNN:
Hmm?
Yeah.
Yes.
Uh, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back.
Uh, what is going on?
My office requested university disciplinary files.
Given the high-profile nature of this case, the university felt that protecting student privacy is paramount.
A student's privacy has already been violated.
He name is Sydney Blair.
Would you have withheld those files if she had been raped by, say, the math team?
How dare you imply...
I'm not implying anything,
I'm telling you right to your face.
You give me those files or I will have you arrested.
You should call the university counsel's office.
Maybe I'll call the L.A. Times.
I'm sure the parents of your female students will be thrilled to read that you condone rape on campus.
Hold on.
What's it going to be, doc?
One more underage drinking bust, I'm going to kill myself.
Yeah, here's one for topless sunbathing.
I miss college.
Whoa, hold on.
In '04, Freeman got picked up by CU police.
What does the report say?
He and Taylor took a girl to the basement, tried to have sex with her, wouldn't let her leave.
Jackpot.
You got a name?
WOMAN:
I was on a college tour with some other kids from my high school.
Brent invited some of us to a party.
I had a few drinks, danced, he seemed cool.
Then what happened, Tandy?
He introduced me to Seth Taylor.
They took me down to this room in the basement.
The rec room?
It's where they raped me.
The file says they tried to have sex with you, there's no mention of rape.
Trust me, it was rape.
I filed a complaint with the university, but they said there wasn't enough evidence.
Why didn't you go to the cops?
I had a scholarship pending.
The day I filed the complaint, it was granted.
I needed the money, so I took the scholarship and I kept my mouth shut.
And I've hated myself ever since.
We all make mistakes, Tandy. MADELEINE:
Can you describe the sexual...
Madeleine, focus, okay?
The two of you have to work together.
Walk us through that night, put the jury in that room.
Make them suffer through it, moment by excruciating moment.
Remember, this isn't a recitation of facts, this is a plea for justice.
Sydney, could you please tell us what happened when the defendants lead you into that room?
At first, we were laughing.
Then Brent started touching my breasts.
I told him to stop, but that's when Seth grabbed me from behind... (voice breaking):
and held me down.
I know this is difficult, but can you tell us what was going through your mind?
It was like a nightmare.
They were on top of me, tearing off my clothes.
I knew what they were doing, but I tried to pretend like it wasn't happening.
They raped me.
No further questions.
Miss Blair, isn't it true you were angry at Josh Carpenter that night?
Yes.
So you went to a party, you had a few drinks and then willingly entered a room with two men you knew wanted to have sex with you?
It wasn't like that.
Were you drinking at the party?
Yes.
Did you willingly go downstairs with my clients, who you openly flirted with?
Yes.
And yet it wasn't like that?
It sounds exactly like that.
Objection.
Withdrawn.
Earlier that morning, you had consensual sex with Mr. Carpenter, correct?
That's right.
And the sex with my clients was consensual as well.
No, they raped me.
But didn't you tell the police Josh Carpenter raped you?
That was a mistake...
No, that was a lie, Miss Blair.
And now you expect this jury to believe you're telling the truth about my clients?
Yes.
Isn't it true you decided to get even with Josh Carpenter by having sex with his friends?
No, that is not...
Josh dumped you.
He broke your heart, and you wanted revenge.
Objection, badgering.
Overruled.
This little performance you're putting on here today, this is all about revenge, isn't it, Miss Blair?
No.
I'm telling the truth.
Really?
And which version of the truth is that-- the one where Josh Carpenter raped you, the one where you lied to the police?
Or is it the version where you were lying before but somehow you're not lying now?
Objection.
Withdrawn.
I appreciate your candor, Miss Blair.
So what's it gonna take to make this go away?
Give me a number.
I'm kidding.
Just a little ice-breaker.
(chuckling)
Had you, huh?
This is an awkward situation, Mr. Stark.
I think the world of Julie.
Well, then why not give her a break?
We both know she didn't do this.
Unfortunately, the evidence against her is strong.
Speaking of the so-called evidence...
Julie's case will be decided by the full review board.
But you run the show.
Which makes any prior discussion of the details inappropriate.
Fine.
But for the record, Julie is completely innocent.
Okay, so if we're not discussing the case, why am I here?
Because I care about Julie.
She's one of our top students and a terrific kid.
I'm just trying to understand how this happened.
How this allegedly happened.
When students exercise poor judgment, often it stems from larger issues.
Drugs, sexual experimentation...
That's crazy.
Forgive me, but from what Julie's told me, you're extremely busy with your legal practice.
So?
It's just that your ex-wife seemed more active in Julie's life.
But she's in New York now.
Exactly.
So with all these changes, it could be that Julie's feeling abandoned.
Whoa.
You are aware the Julie chose to stay in Los Angeles with me?
This is not a personal attack, Mr. Stark.
I'm sure you're doing the best that you can.
I'm perfectly capable of raising my daughter.
I'm sure that you are, it's just that
Julie never had a problem before her mother left.
What is this?
That is a civil suit alleging defamation and slander.
Five million dollars?
No, that's just for starters.
By the time I'm done, this place'll be a Burger King.
Reinstate Julie pending a hearing,
I drop the suit.
Well...
I guess I know how you got your nickname.
And if I were you, I'd take the deal, 'cause during all those years when I was being a lousy, irresponsible father,
I somehow became this bitchin' lawyer.
(chuckles)
Not feeling the love, people.
We're toast.
I read the transcript.
Sydney got torn apart on cross.
Big time.
Not a shock.
But we still have Tandy Parker.
Uh, well, you know, about that.
Please tell me we didn't lose Tandy Parker.
I really wish I could tell you that.
But instead you're going to tell me...
She snuck into the court room and now she's refusing to testify.
STARK:
Can't imagine why.
Oh, maybe the same reason prisoners don't cut in line on their way to the gas chamber.
Well, you guys are right about one thing.
We're definitely toast.
We can subpoena Tandy, force her to testify that Freeman and Taylor raped her.
She'll just deny it.
We're already on thin ice with the jury.
Okay, I may be reaching.
I've been going over the details of Tandy's original statement and she says that she got away from Freeman and Taylor and made a break for the door, but there was someone standing outside.
They used a lookout.
So, two different women were raped by the same two guys at the same location.
If their MO is consistent, that means...
Ladies and gentlemen, we could have an unknown eyewitness.
(indistinct shouting)
What the hell are you guys doing here?
We know you were in the hall when Sydney went into the rec room and when she came out.
So?
If you were involved, now's the time to come clean.
Wait, you think I was part of this?
Look, I tried to help you.
I'm out of here.
Nelson.
I believe you didn't do this.
I just think you know more than you've told me.
I told you everything that I saw.
You didn't tell us about the lookout.
We know that there was someone standing outside that door when Sydney was being raped.
Someone who was making sure that Taylor and Freeman weren't interrupted.
Who was it, Nelson?
Look, don't make me do this.
You know I feel bad about Sydney.
This isn't about Sydney.
One day, this could be your wife or your daughter.
I know...
No.
You don't know.
I know.
When I was 11, we had to live with my aunt in St. Louis and she was seeing this guy, Larry.
Larry was big and handsome, always laughing, playing around, telling jokes, but the joke was on me 'cause one night, handsome Larry came into my room and he got into bed with me.
And this went on for ten months, because I was too scared to say anything.
And then one day, my brother saw us, and he called the cops.
It just takes one person who's not afraid.
Who was the lookout?
It was Josh Carpenter.
There's a special place in hell for Josh Carpenter.
STARK:
But before you call Dante, let's run this thing down.
Nelson Moore's statement puts Carpenter at the scene.
But outside the action.
We could use Carpenter as a material witness against Taylor and Freeman.
He may not be willing to cooperate.
Then we charge him till it hurts.
His false statement to the cops, perjury, obstruction of justice...
We need more.
Ted Jeffries isn't gonna bend over for misdemeanors.
Then let's take our chances with the jury.
Prosecute Josh Carpenter separately as an accessory to rape.
MADELEINE:
He's got no record.
He'll just walk away with a slap on the wrist.
Hmm, no, not necessarily.
In his statement,
Nelson Moore said...
"I approached Josh, asked if everything was cool.
He looked around, said it was and told me to take off."
Okay, so in effect,
Josh Carpenter prevented Nelson from aiding Sydney Blair.
Making him an active participant just as culpable as the others.
Rape in concert-- very creative.
There's just one problem.
Without Carpenter's testimony, no jury will convict these guys of rape.
And without a rape conviction, there's no standing for rape in concert.
(Stark sighs)
Okay, we've got two options.
Plan A, we go after Taylor and Freeman for rape without Carpenter's testimony and then charge Carpenter with rape in concert.
If we're extremely lucky, we nail all three.
If we're not, they all walk.
Plan B:
We use the rape in concert charge to leverage a deal with Josh Carpenter, and then force him to testify against Taylor and Freeman...
Which strengthens our case, but lets a lying jerk go free.
Let's go talk to Sydney Blair.
Wait, I don't understand.
He was outside the door, standing watch.
That can't be true.
I'm afraid it is.
Oh, my God.
I-I mean, I knew Josh was angry, but to stand there and let those animals attack me, I...
Look, our problem is this:
We can't prove that Josh knew what was going on inside that room.
But if we offer him a deal, we can secure his testimony against Taylor and Freeman.
Does that mean that Josh would get away with what he did?
Well, I mean, this has been in the press, it will definitely hurt his reputation and career.
No, that's not what I asked.
It means that Josh won't be prosecuted.
Josh planned this.
He wanted to punish me.
He pointed me out to Brent and Seth, and he watched the door while they raped me!
Please understand this.
If we don't make a deal with Josh Carpenter,
Taylor and Freeman will be acquitted, and no one will pay for what happened to you, Sydney.
I understand.
But Josh Carpenter helped them rape me.
I'm begging you, Mr. Stark.
Don't let him go.
I'm sorry.
Hmm, what was that for?
Getting me back into school.
Well, we still have to deal with the review board.
I know, but it's just nice to be back to the normal routine.
Where you headed?
Uh, Katie and I are gonna go see a movie.
It is a school night.
Yeah?
It just seems like I should know where you're going, probably, just, you know... so I know.
Okay.
It's just that you never really seemed to care that much.
Well, I do.
Okay, so can I go to the movies?
Yes.
Okay, see you later.
Not too late.
Right.
No deal.
A witness put your client at the door during the rape.
Alleged rape, and standing by a door isn't a crime.
It is when you prevent help from entering the room, and you lie to the cops about it.
Then file charges.
Trust me, I would love to.
Fine, this meeting's over.
Josh, you walk out that door,
I will make you regret it for the rest of your life.
JEFFRIES:
Mr. Stark's just bitter.
He hasn't lost in a while.
I'll stuff every petty offense I can dream up into an indictment, and I will splash it across every sports page in the country.
See what that does to your standing in the draft.
Even if you beat every single charge, your reputation is trashed.
Not to mention, you'll be handing over the bulk of your signing bonus to Mr. Jeffries here for his legal fees.
Think about it.
(indistinct whispering)
Josh...
Full immunity.
Sexual misconduct.
18 months, paroled in six, he's out in time for the draft.
You're dreaming.
Ted, he watched a girl get raped.
Without his testimony, you have no case.
Full immunity.
I want the courtroom closed and a gag order on the jury.
(sighs)
I'll draw up the paperwork.
What do you want me to say?
I was pissed off that Sydney came to the party.
I was with my girlfriend.
I didn't want a whole weird scene.
So, what did you do?
I asked Brent and Seth to help me out, and they took her downstairs.
To the rec room?
Yeah.
At first it was cool.
Sydney was having a good time with those guys.
Then she wanted to leave, and you know, they wouldn't let her go.
And you know this how?
'Cause I was at the door... standing guard.
And you're certain what happened in that room was rape?
Yes.
At one point, I could hear Sydney crying.
I opened the door, and...
What did you see?
I saw Seth on top of her, and...
Brent was holding her down.
And he looked at me, and he smiled.
So, what did you do?
Nothing.
Tell me, Josh... what kind of a person sees a young woman being raped and does nothing?
Last question.
Did you ever-- at any time-- consider going inside that room and joining in the rape of Sydney Blair?
Absolutely not.
And why didn't you?
Because I'm not a rapist.
No, right.
You're just a guy who guards the door.
No more questions.
Hey.
Working late?
Just wanted to say, you were really great on this case.
A compliment!
Strictly professional.
The way you got Nelson Moore to cooperate, it was amazing.
Just doing my job.
It was more than that.
You were willing to share this horrible secret so he'd do the right thing.
That took a lot of guts.
Actually, it took a lot of imagination.
I don't have an aunt, I've never been to St. Louis.
I just made it up.
Why would you lie about something like that?
I said what he needed to hear.
You look disappointed.
Of course not.
I guess I thought maybe...
I was starting to understand you a little.
Intimacy's overrated.
You want to grab a drink?
I think I'm gonna pass tonight.
I'm a little tired.
Suit yourself.
Five years apiece for first-degree rape.
And they'll be out in three.
Considering where we started, it's a good verdict.
Except for Josh Carpenter walking away scot free.
Obviously, I'm disappointed that my teammates were involved in something as-as horrible as this.
Josh, can you tell us why you decided to testify?
Well, at the end of the day, I just had to do the right thing.
I say we kick his ass.
Now you're talking.
STARK:
Much as I'd love to see that, and I'm getting aroused just thinking about it, he's not worth it.
The world's not fair, guys.
Just take yes for an answer and move on.
Aren't you gonna say, "I told you so"?
No.
Wise choice.
REPORTER:
Josh, what's your playing status for the rest of the season?
Pretty serious expression.
Just thinking about everything.
(sighs)
You know, from now on, I'm gonna be more involved in your life.
School, hobbies, everything.
I'd really like that.
We're gonna get through this, Jules, trust me.
That review board won't know what hit 'em.
Thank you.
I haven't done anything yet.
Oh, but you have.
Everybody doubted me.
My teachers doubted me, my friends...
I even started doubting myself.
But you were the only one who still believed in me.
And it only took me 16 years to show it.
(sighs)
(voice breaking):
Hey, Dad?
I plagiarized that paper.
* *
(sobbing):
I-I got distracted and ran out of time.
I just downloaded it off the Internet.
I'm so sorry.
(sobbing)
(sighs)

Help me.
You are so bad, you suck.
JULIE:
So let me get this straight.
They played this game last Sunday?
Yeah.
You've run the same draw play five times for minus three yards.
And you already know who won?
And I got the two grand to prove it.
Okay, a little play action.
Roll out, pass and touchdown!
I never doubted you, baby.
So why are you watching this?
Research.
Arnie, give me two dimes on Carolina, and I'll buy the half point.
Right.
So how's that Longfellow term paper coming along?
I get it back tomorrow.
I'm sure you nailed it.
It's all about doing your homework.
And breaking the law.
Massaging the law.
Hey, I only use Arnie when I can't get to Vegas.
Oh, I'm sure a judge would be fine with that.
I'll give up my bookie when you agree to pay for Stanford on your own dime.
Speak to me.
There was three of them.
They took me into a room... and grabbed my throat.
I-I tried to scream, but they held me down,
started ripping off my clothes.
I fought back, but they were too strong.
Sydney, can you identify these men?
They're football players.
I've...
I've seen two of them before.
I don't know their names.
But I know the third one.
Josh Carpenter?
She's positive it was him.
He's the top college quarterback in the country.
-So he can't be a rapist?
-Did I say that?
Enough!
Game plan?
Let's bring in every guy who was there, get Sydney Blair to ID her attackers.
You want to pull an entire football team out of bed for a lineup?
Just the ones who were at the party.
It'll give us a chance to question Josh Carpenter without a lawyer present.
That's borderline illegal.
And yet...
I like it.
Looks like the word's out.
Something tells me CU's about to blow their perfect season.
Only if we nail these guys.
- Who they play on Saturday?
- Arizona.
Arnie, Stark.
Yeah, give me five dimes on Arizona Saturday.
Just a hunch.
We'll nail 'em.
It's a lock.
SHARK 1x05 - "In The Grasp"
Just take your time, Sydney.
Sorry, I don't...
I don't see them.
¡Next lineup!
- Look, I can't do this.
- I know this is hard.
- No, I want to go home.
- And you will, but these guys hurt you.
And if you don't help us now, they're gonna hurt somebody else.
And I know you don't want that.
Okay?
You can do this.
Okay.
Number two.
And number five.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Yeah, they raped me.
Did you see Miss Blair at the party tonight, Josh?
No, sir.
It was pretty crowded.
I was just partying with some friends.
Sydney ID'd the other two suspects as Seth Taylor and Brent Freeman.
- This guy's lawyer's on his way up.
- Did you get a name?
Ted Jeffries.
Party's over.
Were you aware of anything that might have been...
I'm sorry to interrupt, Detective Frye.
I just have a few questions to ask...
- Stark, you're out of line.
- You know, I get that a lot.
Who raped Sydney Blair tonight, Josh?
How should I know?
Did you, Taylor and Freeman take her into that room?
- No.
- She teased you a little bit, you lost control and you raped her?
- That's not true.
- I know.
You're the leader, you're the quarterback, you spot Sydney, she's looking hot.
You call in a few of your blockers, then you go to town.
- That's not what happened.
- If you're lying...
I will find out.
So, if you have something to tell me, son, now's the time.
Don't say another word.
Oh, hey, Ted, I was wondering when you'd show up.
You arresting my client?
Hey, this is a preliminary investigation.
It'd save us a lot of time and effort if he'd just confess now, let us all go to bed.
I got a better idea.
Arrest him or let him go.
Come on.
And if you want a DNA sample, make a motion.
Great.
Now we lost his DNA.
I don't know how to lose.
You just take this bad boy to the lab, and you let me know when you get the results.
And I'll give you the name of my tailor, 'cause those lapels went out with disco.
Thanks for seeing me, Jessica.
And I assure you that all university
- ...resources are at your disposal.
- I appreciate that, Ben.
Sorry, I didn't have a chance to meet Mr. Stark.
Count your blessings.
You know, um, I'd never ask you to compromise your position,
Jessica, but the university PR department's driving me crazy.
If you could give me any indication as to where this is headed...
Downhill, fast.
Mr. Stark, I presume?
Sorry, I'm late.
Not that it matters since the district attorney can't discuss an ongoing case with an interested party.
- Right, Jess?
- The chancellor and I were just wrapping up.
I was hoping we could work together.
Well, that presumes our interests are the same, which clearly they're not.
You're trying to protect the university's million-dollar meal ticket.
I'm trying to prosecute a gang rape.
- I'm sorry, Ben.
- I'm not.
Your boys are going down.
I came to discuss a strategy for managing the avalanche of publicity
- ...to the benefit of all concerned.
- At least to you.
Dr.Flynn feels the less press, the better.
Hmm, what a shock.
I wonder why.
Oh, maybe it's those big fat TV dollars at stake,
Alumni contributions, lost recruits...
Now, that's unfair.
The university wants Justice done in this matter.
Oh, you're in luck, Ben.
I happen to be in the justice business.
Okay, let's break it down.
Victim attends a victory party at the defendant's on-campus residence.
- She arrives at 9:00, has some drinks.
- Find out how many.
Carpenter, Freeman and Taylor take her to a room downstairs make sexual advances;
victim says no, they won't listen.
When the guys go back upstairs to the party, victim runs outside, calls the campus police.
So what's the good news?
Torn clothing, bruising,overwhelming evidence of forced intercourse but here's the headline— Josh Carpenter's DNA found inside the victim.
Oh, there goes the Heisman.
Bad news?
According to witnesses, she was inebriated, she was seen flirting with the suspects, and she went into the room willingly.
But the law is clear.
None of that constitutes consent.
Trials aren't about the law.
If Casey bumped on it, then the jury may, too.
So, we attack it on direct.
Portray her as an unsuspecting teenaged victim.
The problem is that it's he said, she said.
And he is a star quarterback who will be starting in the NFL next year.
Which means our case is based entirely on Sydney's credibility.
Jules?
Um, I'm sorry to interrupt.
I need to talk to you.
What?
I got suspended.
They're accusing me of plagiarism on my Longfellow paper.
They say I stole it off the Internet.
That's insane!
Well, there's this Web site and it's got All kinds of stuff.
It's got essays and outlines and old papers.
And now I have to face the disciplinary review board.
And... if... if they find that I'm guilty, I'm going to get expelled, Dad.
No, don't worry, that is not going to happen.
Yeah, but this is going to destroy Everything I've worked for, Dad.
- And Mom...
Mom is going to kill me.
- Jules...
Jules, take a breath.
Now, who do I talk to?
Uh, Vice Principal Saunders is in charge of the review board.
I want you to collect every note you took, every quote you cited, everything. and have it waiting when I get home.
I promise... everything's going to be okay.
Witnesses saw Sydney on the dance floor around midnight.
Apparently she was doing her share of watermelon shots.
Drinking is not against the law, unlike sexual assault.
I think it's down here.
This is where it happened.
They call this place the rec room.
No clocks, no windows, buried in the basement... it's the perfect place for rape.
Or for studying.
What's your problem?
Teammate of mine in college broke up with this girl.
She freaked out, accused him of date rape.
- Almost didn't graduate.
- That sucks.
It also has nothing to do with this case.
Sydney Blair was raped.
I suggest you wrap your head around that and do your job.
I'm going to go look around.
Whoa!
You're early.
Strippers don't start till 10:00.
I heard steroids shrink your genitals.
Apparently, they have the same effect on the brain.
I'm Deputy DA Madeleine Poe.
Any of you attend the party here Saturday night?
Any criminal justice majors?
You might want to reread the chapter on obstruction of justice.
We already spoke to the cops.
I've read your statements.
There were at least 25 of you down here, and yet none of you saw Sydney Blair go into the rec room with your teammates.
Loyalty's an admirable trait.
Covering for rapists is a crime.
If any of you suddenly grow a conscience, my number's on the card.
Nelson, you got a second?
How do you know my name?
Your number's on your shorts.
I've got a team roster.
Starting receiver as a freshman-- that's impressive.
I've got to get to practice.
According to your statement, you saw Sydney Blair here Saturday night.
Yeah.
But I didn't see what happened.
You seem like a decent guy, Nelson, and I know it's tough to do the right thing here.
Do it anyway.
What's the buzz on campus?
- Typical code of silence.
- Where are we on the arrests?
Warrants have been issued for all three suspects,
Freeman and Taylor have retained separate counsel, and I'm waiting on a call from Jeffries to arrange a self-surrender for Josh Carpenter.
Why are we cutting pretty boy any slack?
The more public his arrest, the better chance he'll cave to protect future endorsements.
Private arrest gives us less chance of a media backlash.
Well, shockingly, you're both right.
Let's pick up all three on the down-low.
Keep Carpenter's million-dollar smile off camera
- ...as long as we can.
- We may be a little late on that.
Josh Carpenter is a great talent.
He's also a fine young man.
The D.A.'s office has levied charges that are completely baseless.
Is it true an arrest warrant has been issued for your client?
Josh offered to surrender voluntarily.
The D.A. clearly wants to humiliate him.
They should be ashamed of themselves.
So much for the down-low.
Okay, I want ten LAPD officers over at the CU campus in one hour.
Now, it would be completely Unprofessional to anonymously tip every crime reporter in town about the big arrest that's about to go down at CU.
- Got it.
- It would be even worse to get Stu Gates over at KCEI on the phone using the personal cell number that I just happen to have here on my Treo.
Check.
Jeffries wants to play games?
Let the games begin.
...awaiting the fate of Heisman hopeful Josh Carpenter.
The LAPD entered the sports complex only moments ago.
Sources inside the D.A.'s office say arrests are imminent.
Reporting live, I'm Tom Phillips, Channel 8 News, Los Angeles.
- Ready.
- Showtime.
Stu Gates, KCEI.
Mr. Stark, why are you sneaking these suspects out?
We're protecting their right to privacy, Stu.
- Is that Josh Carpenter under there?
- Uh... no comment.
I'm sorry.
Care to comment on Ted Jeffries' claim that this is a witch hunt?
You know, a young woman was raped.
And, despite defense counsel's attempt to turn this into a media circus, we intend to pursue justice in a dignified and professional manner.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Well, there you have it.
An uncharacteristically media shy Sebastian Stark plays a by-the-book prosecution in the CU rape case.
Reporting live for KCEI News, I'm Stu Gates.
This just in.
I'm too good.
Hey, so when can I go back to school?
I went through everything, including the school's plagiarism policy, and I have a meeting with this Saunders guy, but you can't go back to class until after the review.
In the meantime, I look guilty.
I'm really sorry, Jules, but I promise you, this is my top priority.
I won't let you down.
Well, what about your case?
This is more important.
Aren't you going to ask if I did it?
I don't need to.
Preliminary hearing,
State v. Carpenter, Taylor and Freeman.
Ted Jeffries representing Josh Carpenter, Your Honor.
The State calls Detective Gordon Frye.
Your Honor, the defense will stipulate to Detective Frye's statement.
Well, then, the State requests this matter be held over for trial, Your Honor.
Affirmative defenses, Mr. Jeffries?
Yes, Your Honor.
I call Josh Carpenter to the stand.
...
I do.
Josh, were you at the campus athletic house on the night in question?
Yes.
I live there.
Did you see the alleged victim, Sydney Blair?
- Yes.
- Do you know Ms. Blair?
I know Sydney very well.
In fact, the two of you were involved in a relationship.
Is that correct?
Kind of.
I have a girlfriend, but Sydney and I had been seeing each other for a few months.
- Objection.
No foundation.
- Overruled.
JEFFRIES:
Josh, can you explain why your DNA was found inside Ms. Blair?
Because we had sex.
The night of the party?
No.
That morning.
In her apartment.
So Sydney Blair isn't just a girl you met at a party.
She's someone with whom you routinely Engaged in consensual sex.
Yes.
...
Well, that changes everything.
So Josh Carpenter didn't rape you?
No.
But everything else happened just like I said.
You lied to us.
Your false accusation is now admissible.
What jury is ever going to believe you?
We can rebuild her credibility.
Not even I am that good.
Now, you got ten seconds to tell me the truth or I am going to drop the rape charges, and I am going to prosecute you for lying to the cops.
I thought if I told you the truth about me and Josh, then you wouldn't believe that I was raped.
That explains why you left out the consensual sex, not why you accused him of rape.
Five seconds.
What do you want me to say?
Nothing.
Time's up.
No.
I don't know why I lied.
Josh and I met three months ago.
He needed help studying for a history exam.
I never met anybody like Josh before.
He... he could have any girl he wanted, and the fact that he was even interested in me blew my mind.
We never went on any dates, really.
I mean, he would... he would call and...
And tell me that he wanted to come over and...
I know he was using me, but I didn't care.
I was in love with him.
What happened that morning?
After we had sex,
I told Josh I wanted a real relationship.
He got mad.
He said that he had an image to uphold.
He said that I was a decent booty call, but that he could never be seen in public with me.
Why did you go to the party?
To get him to change his mind.
Josh wouldn't go near me.
And that's when the two guys came up to me, and they asked me if I wanted to party with them.
What does that mean, party with them?
I was angry, and... confused.
So I went downstairs.
I was just trying to make Josh jealous.
I swear to you, I never wanted anything to happen.
I just wanted the pain to go away.
And instead, I made it so much worse.
So how do we win?
Our victim accused an innocent man of rape.
Game over.
The physical evidence is overwhelming.
Did you ever consider that this girl had a really bad night, took on two guys, then blew the whistle when things got a little too rough?
Isn't "rape" a synonym for "things got a little too rough"?
No.
Not when the sex is consensual.
No, it isn't.
She's telling the truth.
I know it.
I love the arrogance, really, but you've been out of
Law school for roughly ten minutes.
This one's a loser.
If we believe a crime has been committed, it's our duty to prosecute.
With liberty and justice for all.
It's over.
Drop the charges.
No!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I missed the coup.
I said we're done.
You also said, "Trial is war.
Second place is death."
- So?
- So...
I'm too young to die.
Sydney Blair was raped by Brent Freeman and Seth Taylor.
Just give me one day to prove it.
Dismiss the charge against Josh Carpenter.
Find out every detail of Sydney's life.
I mean, from the point of conception.
Find a way to discredit Taylor and Freeman.
You've got 24 hours to live.
Make them count.
Thank you for meeting me, Nelson.
- How's Sydney?
- How do you think?
Did you know she was seeing Josh Carpenter?
No, but I'm not surprised.
Look, that guy's a serious player.
Keeps track of how many girls he's had.
Calls it his completion percentage.
- That's charming.
- He's a scumbag.
He's also the only shot we have at a national championship.
If you could live with that, you wouldn't be here.
What do you want from me?
The truth.
What did you see that night?
I was downstairs.
I saw Seth and Brent Take Sydney into the rec room.
Did you hear anything?
Screaming?
Sounds of a struggle?
Music from the party was too loud.
Were you there when they came out?
Sydney ran past me.
She was crying.
Her shirt was ripped.
When Seth and Brent came out, they were laughing.
I need you to come with me to the precinct and amend your statement.
If I do, I risk everything that I've worked for.
And if you don't, I'll throw you in jail and force you to testify.
At least, this way, you can stay on the team.
Let's go.
Julie, I'm home!
She just got out of the pool.
Julie, there's a half-naked boy dripping in my kitchen!
- Um, Eddie Lyndon.
We met, uh...
- Yeah.
Eddie the Kissing Bandit.
I remember.
So what do you say we save a little time, and I just kill you now and bury you out in the backyard?
- Julie said you were funny.
- I also own a gun.
Can I get your legal opinion on something?
I've had a really lousy day.
My brother's friend Craig was arrested for joyriding.
Nobody saw him, but the cops don't care.
The thing is, my brother knows the lady Who owns the car.
Stop.
Your brother thinks that if he takes the rap, the whole things goes away.
- Exactly.
- Let me get this straight.
You want to take the rap for Julie because you think the school will go easy on you.
This is all my fault.
I gave Julie the name of that Web site.
I was going to use it myself, but she wouldn't let me.
I'm captain of the track team, my mom's on the board, there's no way they'll kick me out.
Forget it It's totally sweet, but totally out of the question.
Let me ask you something.
- You think Julie cheated?
- Of course not, she's way too smart.
I agree-- so let me handle this.
You're a stand up guy, but if I find out you're sleeping with my daughter, I will kill you-- fair enough?
I'm getting major heat to drop this case.
Half the city council are CU alumni.
And they don't want their New Year's trip to the Rose Bowl ruined by something as trivial as gang rape?
Your victim's credibility is trashed.
You're dead in the water.
Sinking fast, not dead.
We found another witness.
- Can they verify the attack?
- Not exactly.
Exactly how far from "exactly"?
He saw the girl go in the room, he saw her come out crying.
Oh, well, surprised these boys haven't pled guilty already.
Well, he saw the suspects come out laughing.
It still brings us back to a credibility contest, which you lose.
I've been following up on accusations Against the players in that house.
DUIs, fights, improper sexual conduct...
Anything on Taylor and Freeman?
Checked with the CU police, apparently most of these complaints are handled by the student/faculty court.
I'll put in a call to Dr. Flynn.
I already did that-- he denied our request to view all cases involving CU players over the past four years.
- Told you that gut was a weasel.
- I'll get a warrant.
We can't risk the university's lawyers tying us up in court.
You know, I'll speak to Dr. Flynn personally.
He has the right to withhold files pending a court order.
And I have the right to request he reconsider.
Uh, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back.
Uh, what is going on?
My office requested university disciplinary files.
Given the high-profile nature of this case, the university felt that protecting student privacy is paramount.
A student's privacy has already been violated.
Her name is Sydney Blair.
Would you have withheld those files if she had been raped by, say, the math team?
- How dare you imply...
- I'm not implying anything,
I'm telling you right to your face.
You give me those files or I will have you arrested.
You should call the university counsel's office.
Maybe I'll call the L.A. Times.
I'm sure the parents of your female students will be thrilled to read that you condone rape on campus.
Hold on.
What's it going to be, doc?
One more underage drinking bust, I'm going to kill myself.
Yeah, here's one for topless sunbathing.
I miss college.
Whoa, hold on.
In '04, Freeman got picked up by CU police.
What does the report say?
He and Taylor took a girl to the basement, tried to have sex with her, wouldn't let her leave.
Jackpot.
You got a name?
I was on a college tour with some other kids from my high school.
Brent invited some of us to a party.
I had a few drinks, danced, he seemed cool.
Then what happened, Tandy?
He introduced me to Seth Taylor.
They took me down to this room in the basement.
The rec room?
It's where they raped me.
The file says they tried to have sex with you, there's no mention of rape.
Trust me, it was rape.
I filed a complaint with the university, but they said there wasn't enough evidence.
Why didn't you go to the cops?
I had a scholarship pending.
The day I filed the complaint, it was granted.
I needed the money, so I took the scholarship and I kept my mouth shut.
And I've hated myself ever since.
We all make mistakes, Tandy.
But you are about to get a second chance.
- Please, say your name for the record.
- Sydney Blair.
make eye contact with the jury, Sydney.
Connect with them.
Onthe night in question.., Did you attend the party...
- ...thrown by Seth Taylor and--
- No first names.
Think, I'm not going to be there holding your hand tomorrow.
Did you attend the party thrown by the defenders?
Yes.
Don't look down, Sydney.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
You are the victim.
- Can you describe the sexual...
- Madeleine, focus, okay?
The two of you have to work together.
Walk us through that night, put the jury in that room.
Make them suffer through it, moment by excruciating moment.
Remember, this isn't a recitation of facts, this is a plea for justice.
Sydney, could you please tell us what happened when the defendants lead you into that room?
At first, we were laughing.
Then Brent started touching my breasts.
I told him to stop, but that's when Seth grabbed me from behind... and held me down.
I know this is difficult, but can you tell us what was going through your mind?
It was like a nightmare.
They were on top of me, tearing off my clothes.
I knew what they were doing, but I tried to pretend like it wasn't happening.
They raped me.
No further questions.
Miss Blair, isn't it true you were angry at Josh Carpenter that night?
Yes.
So you went to a party, you had a few drinks and then willingly entered a room with two men you knew wanted to have sex with you?
- It wasn't like that.
- Were you drinking at the party?
Yes.
Did you willingly go downstairs with my clients, who you openly flirted with?
Yes.
And yet it wasn't like that?
It sounds exactly like that.
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.
Earlier that morning, you had consensual sex with Mr. Carpenter, correct?
- That's right.
- And the sex with my clients
- --was consensual as well.
- No, they raped me.
But didn't you tell the police Josh Carpenter raped you?
- That was a mistake...
- No, that was a lie, Miss Blair.
And now you expect this jury to believe you're telling the truth about my clients?
- Yes.
- Isn't it true you decided to get even with Josh Carpenter by having sex with his friends?
- No, that is not...
- Josh dumped you.
He broke your heart, and you wanted revenge.
- Objection, badgering.
- Overruled.
This little performance you're putting on here today, this is all about revenge, isn't it, Miss Blair?
No.
I'm telling the truth.
Really?
And which version of the truth is that-- the one where Josh Carpenter raped you, the one where you lied to the police?
Or is it the version where you were lying before but somehow you're not lying now?
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.
I appreciate your candor, Miss Blair.
So what's it gonna take to make this go away?
Give me a number.
I'm kidding.
Just a little ice-breaker.
Had you, huh?
This is an awkward situation, Mr. Stark.
I think the world of Julie.
Well, then why not give her a break?
We both know she didn't do this.
Unfortunately, the evidence against her is strong.
Speaking of the so-called evidence...
Julie's case will be decided by the full review board.
But you run the show.
Which makes any prior discussion of the details inappropriate.
But for the record, Julie is completely innocent.
Okay, so if we're not discussing the case, why am I here?
Because I care about Julie.
She's one of our top students and a terrific kid.
I'm just trying to understand how this happened.
How this allegedly happened.
When students exercise poor judgment, often it stems from larger issues.
Drugs, sexual experimentation...
That's crazy.
Forgive me, but from what Julie's told me, you're extremely busy with your legal practice.
So?
It's just that your ex-wife seemed more active in Julie's life.
But she's in New York now.
Exactly.
So with all these changes, it could be that Julie's feeling abandoned.
Whoa.
You are aware the Julie chose to stay in Los Angeles with me?
This is not a personal attack, Mr. Stark.
I'm sure you're doing the best that you can.
I'm perfectly capable of raising my daughter.
I'm sure that you are, it's just that Julie never had a problem
before her mother left.
What is this?
That is a civil suit alleging defamation and slander.
- Five million dollars?
- No, that's just for starters.
By the time I'm done, this place'll be a Burger King.
Reinstate Julie pending a hearing, I drop the suit.
Well...
I guess I know how you got your nickname.
And if I were you, I'd take the deal, 'cause during all those years when I was being a lousy, irresponsible father,
I somehow became this bitchin' lawyer.
- Not feeling the love, people.
- We're toast.
I read the transcript.
Sydney got torn apart on cross.
- Big time.
- Not a shock.
But we still have Tandy Parker.
Uh, well, you know, about that.
Please tell me we didn't lose Tandy Parker.
I really wish I could tell you that.
But instead you're going to tell me...
She snuck into the court room and now she's refusing to testify.
Can't imagine why.
Oh, maybe the same reason prisoners don't cut in line on their way to the gas chamber.
Well, you guys are right about one thing.
We're definitely toast.
We can subpoena Tandy, force her to testify that Freeman and Taylor raped her.
She'll just deny it.
We're already on thin ice with the jury.
Okay, I may be reaching.
I've been going over the details of Tandy's original statement I've been going over the details from Freeman and Taylor and made a break for the door, but there was someone standing outside.
They used a lookout.
So, two different women were raped by the same two guys at the same location.
If their MO is consistent, that means...
Ladies and gentlemen, we could have an unknown eyewitness.
What the hell are you guys doing here?
We know you were in the hall when Sydney went into the rec room and when she came out.
So?
If you were involved, now's the time to come clean.
Wait, you think I was part of this?
Look, I tried to help you.
I'm out of here.
Nelson.
I believe you didn't do this.
I just think you know more than you've told me.
I told you everything that I saw.
You didn't tell us about the lookout.
We know that there was someone standing outside that door when Sydney was being raped.
Someone who was making sure that Taylor and Freeman weren't interrupted.
Who was it, Nelson?
Look, don't make me do this.
You know I feel bad about Sydney.
This isn't about Sydney.
One day, this could be your wife or your daughter.
- I know...
- No.
You don't know.
I know.
When I was 11, we had to live with my aunt in St. Louis and she was seeing this guy, Larry.
Larry was big and handsome, always laughing, playing around, telling jokes, but the joke was on me 'cause one night, handsome Larry came into my room and he got into bed with me.
And this went on for ten months, because I was too scared to say anything.
And then one day, my brother saw us, and he called the cops.
It just takes one person who's not afraid.
Who was the lookout?
It was Josh Carpenter.
There's a special place in hell for Josh Carpenter.
But before you call Dante, let's run this thing down.
Nelson Moore's statement puts Carpenter at the scene.
But outside the action.
We could use Carpenter as a material Witness against Taylor and Freeman.
He may not be willing to cooperate.
Then we charge him till it hurts.
His false statement to the cops, perjury, obstruction of justice...
We need more.
Ted Jeffries isn't gonna bend over for misdemeanors.
Then let's take our chances with the jury.
Prosecute Josh Carpenter separately as an accessory to rape.
He's got no record.
He'll just walk away with a slap on the wrist.
Hmm, no, not necessarily.
In his statement, Nelson Moore said...
"I approached Josh, asked if everything was cool.
He looked around, said it was and told me to take off."
Okay, so in effect, Josh Carpenter Prevented Nelson from aiding Sydney Blair.
Making him an active participant just as culpable as the others.
Rape in concert-- very creative.
There's just one problem.
Without Carpenter's testimony, no jury will convict these guys of rape.
And without a rape conviction, there's no standing for rape in concert.
Okay, we've got two options.
Plan A, we go after Taylor and Freeman for rape without Carpenter's testimony and then charge Carpenter with rape in concert.
If we're extremely lucky, we nail all three.
If we're not, they all walk.
Plan B:
We use the rape in concert charge to leverage a deal with Josh Carpenter, and then force him to testify against Taylor and Freeman...
Which strengthens our case, but lets a lying jerk go free.
Let's go talk to Sydney Blair.
Wait, I don't understand.
He was outside the door, standing watch.
- That can't be true.
- I'm afraid it is.
Oh, my God.
I-I mean, I knew Josh was angry, but to stand there and let those animals attack me, I...
Look, our problem is this:
We can't prove that Josh knew what was going on inside that room.
But if we offer him a deal, we can secure his testimony against Taylor and Freeman.
Does that mean that Josh would get away with what he did?
Well, I mean, this has been in the press, it will definitely hurt his reputation and career.
- No, that's not what I asked.
- It means that Josh won't be prosecuted.
Josh planned this.
He wanted to punish me.
He pointed me out to Brent and Seth, and he watched the door while they raped me!
Please understand this.
If we don't make a deal with Josh Carpenter,
Taylor and Freeman will be acquitted, and no one will pay for what happened to you, Sydney.
I understand.
But Josh Carpenter helped them rape me.
I'm begging you, Mr. Stark.
Don't let him go.
I'm sorry.
Hmm, what was that for?
Getting me back into school.
Well, we still have to deal with the review board.
I know, but it's just nice to be back to the normal routine.
- Where you headed?
- Uh, Katie and I are gonna go see a movie.
- It is a school night.
- Yeah?
It just seems like I should know where you're going, probably, just, you know... so I know.
Okay.
It's just that you never really seemed to care that much.
Well, I do.
Okay, so can I go to the movies?
Yes.
- Okay, see you later.
- Not too late.
Right.
No deal.
A witness put your client at the door during the rape.
Alleged rape, and standing by a door isn't a crime.
It is when you prevent help from entering the room, and you lie to the cops about it.
Then file charges.
Trust me, I would love to.
Fine, this meeting's over.
Josh, you walk out that door, I will make you regret it for the rest of your life.
Mr. Stark's just bitter.
He hasn't lost in a while.
I'll stuff every petty offense I can dream up into an indictment, and I will splash it across every sports page in the country.
See what that does to your standing in the draft.
Even if you beat every single charge, your reputation is trashed.
Not to mention, you'll be handing over the bulk of your signing bonus to Mr. Jeffries here for his legal fees.
Think about it.
Full immunity.
Sexual misconduct. 18 months, paroled in six,
- --he's out in time for the draft.
- You're dreaming.
Ted, he watched a girl get raped.
Without his testimony, you have no case.
Full immunity.
I want the courtroom closed and a gag order on the jury.
I'll draw up the paperwork.
What do you want me to say?
I was pissed off that Sydney came to the party.
I was with my girlfriend.
I didn't want a whole weird scene.
So, what did you do?
I asked Brent and Seth to help me out, and they took her downstairs.
To the rec room?
Yeah.
At first it was cool.
Sydney was having a good time with those guys.
Then she wanted to leave, and you know, they wouldn't let her go.
And you know this how?
'Cause I was at the door... standing guard.
And you're certain what happened in that room was rape?
Yes.
At one point, I could hear Sydney crying.
I opened the door, and...
What did you see?
I saw Seth on top of her, and...
Brent was holding her down.
And he looked at me, and he smiled.
So, what did you do?
Nothing.
Tell me, Josh... what kind of a person sees a young woman being raped and does nothing?
Last question.
Did you ever-- at any time-- consider going inside that room and joining in the rape of Sydney Blair?
Absolutely not.
- And why didn't you?
- Because I'm not a rapist.
No, right.
You're just a guy who guards the door.
No more questions.
Working late?
Just wanted to say, you were really great on this case.
A compliment!
No, right.
The way you got Nelson Moore to cooperate,
No, right.
- Just doing my job.
- It was more than that.
You were willing to share this horrible secret so he'd do the right thing.
That took a lot of guts.
Actually, it took a lot of imagination.
I don't have an aunt, I've never been to St. Louis.
I just made it up.
Why would you lie about something like that?
I said what he needed to hear.
You look disappointed.
Of course not.
I guess I thought maybe...
I was starting to understand you a little.
Intimacy's overrated.
You want to grab a drink?
I think I'm gonna pass tonight.
I'm a little tired.
Suit yourself.
Five years apiece for first-degree rape.
And they'll be out in three.
Considering where we started, it's a good verdict.
Except for Josh Carpenter walking away scot free.
Obviously, I'm disappointed that my teammates were involved in something as-as horrible as this.
Josh, can you tell us why you decided to testify?
Well, at the end of the day, I just had to do the right thing.
- I say we kick his ass.
- Now you're talking.
Much as I'd love to see that, and I'm getting aroused just thinking about it, he's not worth it.
The world's not fair, guys.
Just take yes for an answer and move on.
Aren't you gonna say, "I told you so"?
- No.
- Wise choice.
Pretty serious expression.
Just thinking about everything.
You know, from now on, I'm gonna be more involved in your life.
School, hobbies, everything.
I'd really like that.
We're gonna get through this, Jules, trust me.
That review board won't know what hit 'em.
Thank you.
I haven't done anything yet.
Oh, but you have.
Everybody doubted me.
My teachers doubted me, my friends...
I even started doubting myself.
But you were the only one who still believed in me.
And it only took me 16 years to show it.
Hey, Dad?
I plagiarized that paper.
I-I got distracted and ran out of time.
I just downloaded it off the Internet.
I'm so sorry.
Take it.
Help me.
Just not working...
- You are so bad, you suck.
- So let me get this straight they played this game last Sunday?
- Yeah.
You've run the same draw play five times for minus three yards.
- You know who won.
- Got 2 grand to prove it.
Okay, a little play action.
Roll out, pass and touchdown.
- I never doubted you, baby.
- So why are you watching this?
Research.
Arnie, give me two dimes on Carolina and I'll buy the half point.
Right.
- How's that Longfellow term paper?
- I get it back tomorrow.
I'm sure you nailed it.
It's about doing your homework.
- And breaking the law?
- Massaging the law.
I use Arnie when I can't get to Vegas.
I'm sure a judge would be fine with that.
I'll give up my bookie when you agree to pay for Stanford on your own dime.
Speak to me.
There was three of them.
They took me into a room and grabbed my throat.
I tried to scream but they held me down started ripping off my clothes.
I fought back but they were too strong.
Sydney, can you identify these men?
They're football players.
I've seen two of them before.
I don't know their names.
But I know the third one.
- Josh Carpenter?
- She's positive it was him.
The country's top college quarterback.
- He can't be a rapist?
- Did I say that?
- Enough.
Game plan?
- Bring in every guy who was there get Sydney to ID her attackers.
You wanna pull an entire team for a lineup?
Just the ones who were at the party.
It'll give a chance to question Josh Carpenter without a lawyer.
- That's borderline illegal.
- And yet, I like it.
The word's out.
Something tells me CU's about to blow their perfect season.
- Lf we nail them.
- Who are they playing?
- Arizona.
- Ah.
Arnie.
Stark.
Yeah, give me five dimes on Arizona Saturday.
Just a hunch.
We'll nail them.
It's a lock.
Just take your time, Sydney.
I'm sorry, I don't see them.
- Next group.
- Look, I can't do this.
- I know this is hard.
- No, I wanna go home.
And you will.
But these guys hurt you.
If you don't help, they're gonna hurt somebody else.
And I know you don't want that, okay?
You can do this.
We're ready, ma'am.
Number two.
And number five.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, they raped me.
Did you see Ms. Blair at the party tonight, Josh?
No, sir.
It was pretty crowded.
I was just partying with some friends.
Sydney ID'd the other two suspects as Seth Taylor and Brent Freeman.
- This guy's lawyer's on his way.
- Did you get a name?
- Ted Jeffries.
- Uch.
Party's over.
Were you aware of anything that was out?
Sorry to interrupt, Det.
Frye, I have a few questions.
- Stark, you're out of line.
- You know, I get that a lot.
- Who raped Sydney Blair tonight, Josh?
- How should I know?
Did you take her into that room?
- No.
- She teased you a little you lost control and raped her?
- Not true.
You're the leader, the quarterback.
You spot Sydney looking hot you call in your blockers, then go to town.
- That's not what happened.
- Lf you're lying, I will find out.
So if you have something to tell me, son, now's the time.
Don't say another word.
I was wondering when you'd show up.
- You arresting my client?
- Hey, this is a preliminary investigation.
It'd save us time and effort if he'd confess and let us go to bed.
I got a better idea.
Arrest him or let him go.
Come on.
And if you want a DNA sample, make a motion.
Great.
Now we lost his DNA.
I don't know how to lose.
You just take this bad boy to the lab.
Let me know when you get the results.
And I'll give you the name of my tailor because those lapels went out with disco.
Thanks for seeing me, Jessica.
I assure you all university resources are at your disposal.
- I appreciate that, Ben.
- Sorry I didn't meet Mr. Stark.
Count your blessings.
Um, I'd never ask you to compromise your position, Jessica but the university PR department's driving me crazy.
If you could give me indication as to where this is headed.
Downhill, fast.
- Mr. Stark, I presume.
- Sorry I'm late.
Not that it matters since the DA can't discuss a case with an interested party.
- Right, Jess?
- We were wrapping up.
We could work together.
That presumes our interests are the same, they're not.
You protecting a million-dollar meal ticket.
- I'm trying to prosecute a gang rape.
- I'm sorry, Ben.
I'm not.
Your boys are going down.
I came to discuss strategy for managing the publicity to the benefit of all.
- At least to you.
- Dr. Flynn feels the less press the better.
What a shock.
I wonder why?
Maybe it's those big fat TV dollars at stake.
- Alumni contributions, lost recruits...
- Now that's unfair.
The university wants justice done in this.
Well, you're in luck, Ben.
I happen to be in the justice business.
Okay, let's break it down.
Victim attends a party at the defendants' on-campus residence.
- She arrives at 9, has some drinks.
- Find out how many.
Carpenter, Freeman and Taylor take her to a room downstairs make sexual advances.
Victim says no, they won't listen.
When the guys go back to the party, victim runs, calls the campus police.
- What's the good news?
- Torn clothing, bruising.
Evidence of forced intercourse.
But here's the headline.
Josh Carpenter's DNA found inside the victim.
Goodbye Heisman.
Bad news?
According to witnesses, she was inebriated flirting with the suspects and went in willingly.
The law is clear.
None of that constitutes consent.
Trials aren't about law.
If Casey bumped on it, the jury may.
So we attack it on direct.
Portray her as an unsuspecting teenage victim.
Problem is it's he said-she said.
He is a quarterback who'll be starting in the NFL next year.
Which means our case is based entirely on Sydney's credibility.
- Jules?
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
I need to talk to you.
- What?
- I got suspended.
They're accusing me of plagiarism on my Longfellow paper.
- They say I stole it off the Internet.
- Well, that's insane.
There's this website, it's got all kinds of stuff.
It's got essays and outlines and old papers.
And now I have to face the Disciplinary Review Board.
And if they find that I'm guilty, I'm gonna get expelled, Dad.
No, don't worry.
That is not gonna happen.
This is gonna destroy everything I've worked for, Dad and mom is gonna kill me...
- Jules, Jules, take a breath.
Now, who do I talk to?
Uh, Vice Principal Saunders is in charge of the review board.
I want you to collect every note you took every quote you cited, everything and have it waiting when I get home.
I promise, everything's gonna be okay.
Witnesses saw Sydney on the dance floor.
Apparently, she was doing her share of watermelon shots.
Well, drinking's not against the law, unlike sexual assault.
I think it's down here.
Let's go.
- This is where it happened.
- They call this place the rec room.
No clocks, no windows, buried in a basement.
- It's the perfect place for rape.
- Or for studying.
What's your problem?
Teammate of mine in college broke up with this girl she freaked out, accused him of date rape.
He almost didn't graduate.
That sucks.
It also has nothing to do with this case.
Sydney Blair was raped.
I suggest you wrap your head around that and do your job.
I'm gonna go look around.
He skipped school...
Whoa.
You're early.
Strippers don't start till 10.
I heard steroids shrink your genitals.
Apparently, they have the same affect on the brain.
I'm Deputy DA Madeleine Poe.
Any of you attend the party here Saturday night?
Any criminal-justice majors?
Might wanna reread the chapter on obstruction of justice.
- We already spoke to the cops.
- I read your statements.
There were at least 25 of you down here and yet none of you saw Sydney Blair go into the rec room with your teammates.
Loyalty's an admirable trait, covering for rapists is a crime.
If any of you suddenly grow a conscience, my number's on the card.
- Nelson, you got a second?
- How do you know my name?
Your number's on your shorts.
I've got a team roster.
- Starting receiver as a freshman.
- I've gotta get to practice.
According to your statement, you saw Sydney Blair here Saturday night.
Yeah, but I didn't see what happened.
You seem like a decent guy, Nelson.
And I know it's tough to do the right thing here.
Do it anyway.
- What's the buzz on campus?
- Typical code of silence.
- Where are we on the arrests?
- Warrants issued for all suspects.
Freeman and Taylor retained counsel.
I'm waiting on a call to arrange a self-surrender for Josh Carpenter.
Why are we cutting pretty boy any slack?
The more public his arrest, he'll cave to protect endorsements.
Private arrest gives us less chance of backlash.
Shockingly, you're both right.
Let's pick up all three on the down low.
Keep Carpenter's million-dollar smile off camera long as we can.
We may be a little late on that.
Josh Carpenter is a great talent.
He's also a fine young man.
The D A 's office has levied charges that are completely baseless.
But is it true an arrest warrant has been issued for your client?
Josh offered to surrender voluntarily.
The D A clearly wants to humiliate him.
They should be ashamed of themselves.
- So much for the down low.
- Okay.
I want 10 L.A.P.D. Officers over at the CU campus in one hour.
Now, it would be completely unprofessional to anonymously tip every crime reporter about the big arrest that's about to go down at CU.
- Got it.
It would be even worse to get Stu Gates over at KCEl on the phone using the personal cell number I happen to have on my trusty phone.
Check.
Jeffries wants to play games, let the games begin.
REPORTER Taken away from the scene as allegations of rape swirl around the nation's top-ranked football team.
Hundreds have gathered awaiting the fate of Heisman hopeful, Josh Carpenter.
The L.A.P.D. Entered the sports complex only moments ago.
Sources inside the DA's office say arrests are imminent.
Reporting live, I'm Tom Phillips, Channel Eight News, Los Angeles.
- Ready.
- Showtime.
- Let's go, guys.
- Stu Gates, KCEl News.
Why are you sneaking these suspects out?
- Protecting their right to privacy.
- Is that Josh Carpenter under there?
Uh, no comment.
Sorry.
Care to comment on Ted Jeffries' claim that this is a witch hunt?
You know, a young woman was raped.
Despite defense counsel's attempt to turn this into a media circus we intend to pursue justice in a professional manner.
Thank you.
Thank you, Stu.
Well, there you have it.
An uncharacteristically media shy Sebastian Stark pledges a by-the-book prosecution in the CU rape case.
Reporting live for KCEl News...
This just in.
I'm too good.
Hey, so when can I go back to school?
I went through everything, including the plagiarism policy.
And I have a meeting with this Saunders guy.
But you can't go back to class until after the review.
In the meantime, I look guilty.
I'm really sorry, Jules.
But I promise you this is my top priority.
I won't let you down.
Well, what about your case?
This is more important.
Aren't you gonna ask if I did it?
I don't need to.
Preliminary hearing.
State v. Carpenter, Taylor and Freeman.
Ted Jeffries representing Josh Carpenter, Your Honor.
Vivian Anderson for Seth Taylor and Brent Freeman.
- Mr. Stark, ready to proceed?
- Yes, Your Honor.
The state calls Detective Gordon Frye.
Your Honor, the defense will stipulate to Detective Frye's statement.
Well, then the state requests this matter be held over for trial, Your Honor.
- Affirmative defenses, Mr. Jeffries?
- Yes, Your Honor.
I call Josh Carpenter to the stand.
Do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth?
I do.
Josh, were you at the campus athletic house on the night in question?
Yes, I live there.
Did you see the alleged victim, Sydney Blair?
- Yes.
- Do you know Ms. Blair?
I know Sydney very well.
In fact, the two of you were involved in a relationship, is that correct?
Kind of.
I have a girlfriend, but Sydney and I had been seeing each other.
Objection.
No foundation.
Overruled.
Josh, can you explain why your DNA was found inside Ms. Blair?
- Because we had sex.
- Night of the party?
No.
That morning, in her apartment.
So Sydney Blair isn't just a girl you met at a party.
She's someone with whom you routinely engaged in consensual sex?
Yes.
Well, Josh, I have to say, that changes everything.
Josh Carpenter didn't rape you?
No.
But everything else happened like I said.
You lied to us.
Your false accusation is now admissible.
What jury is ever gonna believe you?
- We can rebuild her credibility.
- Not even I am that good.
Ten seconds to tell the truth or I drop the charges and I am going to prosecute you for lying to the cops.
I thought if I told you the truth, you wouldn't believe I was raped.
That's why you left out the consensual sex, not why you accused him of rape.
Five seconds.
- What do you want me to say?
- Nothing.
Time's up.
I don't know why I lied.
I don't know why I lied.
Josh and I met three months ago.
He needed help studying for a history exam.
Look, I never met anybody like Josh before.
He could have any girl he wanted.
And the fact that he was even interested in me blew my mind.
We never went on any dates really.
I mean, he would call and tell me that he wanted to come over and I know he was using me but I didn't care.
I was in love with him.
What happened that morning?
After we had sex I told Josh I wanted a real relationship.
He got mad.
He said that he had an image to uphold.
He said that I was a decent booty call but that he could never be seen in public with me.
Why did you go to the party?
To get him to change his mind.
Josh wouldn't go near me.
And that's when the two guys came up to me and they asked me if I wanted to party with them.
- What does that mean, party with them?
- I was angry and confused.
So I went downstairs.
I was just trying to make Josh jealous.
I swear to you I never wanted anything to happen.
I just wanted the pain to go away.
And instead I made it so much worse.
- How do we win?
- Our victim accused an innocent of rape.
- Game over.
- The physical evidence is overwhelming.
Ever consider that this girl had a bad night, took on two guys blew the whistle when it got rough?
Isn't rape a synonym for "things got rough"?
No.
Not when the sex is consensual.
- She's telling the truth.
I know it.
- I love the arrogance.
You've been out of school for 10 minutes.
This one's a loser.
If a crime has been committed, it's our duty to prosecute.
Liberty and justice for all.
It's over, drop the charges.
- No.
- Oh, I'm sorry, I missed the coup.
I said we're done.
You also said trial is war, second place is death.
- So?
- So I'm too young to die.
Sydney Blair was raped by Brent Freeman and Seth Taylor.
Just give me one day to prove it.
Dismiss the charge against Josh Carpenter.
Find out every detail of Sydney's life.
I mean, from the point of conception.
Find a way to discredit Taylor and Freeman.
You've got 24 hours to live.
Make them count.
- Thank you for meeting me, Nelson.
- How's Sydney?
Well, how do you think?
Did you know she was seeing Josh Carpenter?
No, but I'm not surprised.
Look, that guy's a serious player.
Keeps track of the girls he's had.
Calls it completion percentage.
- That's charming.
- He's a scumbag.
Also the only shot we have at a championship.
If you could live with that, you wouldn't be here.
- What do you want from me?
- The truth.
What did you see that night?
I was downstairs.
I saw Seth and Brent take Sydney into the rec room.
Did you hear anything?
Screaming?
Sounds of a struggle?
- Music from the party was too loud.
- Were you there when they came out?
Sydney ran past me.
She was crying, her shirt was ripped.
When Seth and Brent came out, they were laughing.
Come with me to the precinct and amend your statement.
- Lf I do, I risk everything I've worked for.
- Lf you don't, I'll throw you in jail and force you to testify.
At least this way you can stay on the team.
Let's go.
Julie, I'm home.
She, uh, just got out of the pool.
Julie, there's a half-naked boy dripping on my kitchen.
Eddie Linden.
We met...
Yeah, Eddie the kissing bandit.
I remember.
So, what do you say we save time, I just kill you and bury you out in the backyard?
- Ha.
Julie said you were funny.
- I also own a gun.
- Can I get a legal opinion on something?
- I had a really lousy day.
My brother's friend, Craig, was arrested for joy riding.
Nobody saw him, but the cops don't care.
The thing is, my brother knows the lady who owns the car.
Stop.
Your brother thinks if he takes the rap for Craig, the whole thing goes away.
- Exactly.
- Let me get this straight.
You wanna take the rap for Julie because you think the school will go easy on you.
This is all my fault.
I gave Julie the name of that website.
I was gonna use it myself, but she wouldn't let me.
I'm captain of the track team.
My mom's on the board, no way they'll kick me out.
Forget it.
It's totally sweet, but totally out of the question.
Let me ask you something.
- You think she cheated?
- Of course not, she's too smart.
I agree, so let me handle this.
You're a stand-up guy.
But if I find out you're sleeping with my daughter, I will kill you.
Fair enough?
I'm getting major heat to drop this.
Half the city council are CU alumni.
They don't want their trip to the Rose Bowl ruined by gang rape?
Your victim's credibility is trashed.
You're dead.
Sinking fast, not dead.
We found another witness.
- Can they verify the attack?
- Not exactly.
Exactly how far from exactly?
He saw the girl go in the room.
He saw her come out crying.
I'm surprised those boys haven't pled guilty.
Well, he saw the suspects laughing.
Brings us back to credibility contest, which you lose.
Been following up on accusations against the players.
- DUI's, fights, sexual conduct...
- Anything on Taylor and Freeman?
- With the CU Police.
Most complaints are handled by the student-faculty court.
- I'll put in a call to Dr. Flynn.
- Already did.
Denied our request to view cases involving CU players over the past four years.
- Told you he was a weasel.
- I'll get a warrant.
We can't risk the university's lawyers tying us up.
I'll speak to Dr. Flynn.
He has the right to withhold files.
And I have the right to request he reconsider.
Sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back.
What is going on?
My office requested university disciplinary files.
Given the high-profile nature of this, protecting student privacy is paramount.
A student's privacy has been violated, her name's Sydney Blair.
Would you've withheld if she'd been raped by the math team?
- How dare you...
- I'm not implying anything.
I'm telling you, give me those files, or I will have you arrested.
- Call the university council's office.
- Maybe I'll call the L.A. Times.
Parents of your female students would be thrilled to read that you condone rape on campus.
- Hold on.
- What's it gonna be, doc?
One more underage-drinking bust and I'm gonna kill myself.
Yeah, here's one for topless sunbathing.
- I miss college.
- Whoa, hold on.
- In '04, Freeman got picked up by police.
- What does the report say?
He and Taylor took a girl, tried to have sex, wouldn't let her leave.
Jackpot.
You got a name?
I was on a college tour with some other kids from my high school.
Brent invited some of us to a party.
I had a few drinks, danced.
He seemed cool.
Then what happened, Tandi?
He introduced me to Seth Taylor.
They took me down to this room in the basement.
The rec room?
It's where they raped me.
The file says they tried to have sex with you.
There's no mention of rape.
Trust me.
It was rape.
I filed a complaint with the university but they said there wasn't enough evidence.
Why didn't you go to the cops?
I had a scholarship pending.
The day I filed the complaint, it was granted.
I needed the money.
So I took the scholarship and I kept my mouth shut.
And I've hated myself ever since.
We all make mistakes, Tandi.
But you're about to get a second chance.
- Please state your name for the record.
- Sydney Blair.
Make eye contact with the jury, Sydney.
Connect with them.
On the night in question, did you attend a party thrown by Seth...
No first names.
Think.
I'm not gonna be there to hold your hand.
Did you attend a party thrown by the defendants?
- Yes.
- Don't look down, Sydney.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
You're the victim.
- Can you describe the sex as?
- Madeleine.
Focus, okay?
The two of you have to work together.
Walk us through that night.
Put the jury in that room.
Make them suffer through it moment by excruciating moment.
This isn't a recitation of facts, this is a plea for justice.
Sydney, could you please tell us what happened when the defendants led you into that room?
At first, we were laughing.
Then Brent started touching my breasts.
I told him to stop.
But that's when Seth grabbed me from behind and held me down.
I know this is difficult.
But can you tell us what was going through your mind?
It was like a nightmare.
They were on top of me, tearing off my clothes.
I knew what they were doing, but I tried to pretend like it wasn't happening.
They raped me.
No further questions.
Ms. Blair, isn't it true you were angry at Josh Carpenter that night?
- Yes.
- So you went to a party you had a few drinks then willingly entered a room with men you knew wanted to have sex with you?
It wasn't like that.
- Were you drinking at the party?
- Yes.
Did you willingly go downstairs with my clients who you openly flirted with?
- Yes.
- And yet it wasn't like that?
- It sounds exactly like that.
- Objection.
Withdrawn.
Earlier that morning, you had consensual sex with Mr. Carpenter, correct?
That's right.
And the sex with my clients was consensual as well?
No.
They raped me.
But didn't you tell the police Josh Carpenter raped you?
- That was a mistake...
- No.
That was a lie, Ms. Blair.
And now you expect this jury to believe you're telling the truth about my clients?
- Yes.
- Isn't it true you decided to get even with Josh by having sex with his friends?
- No, that...
- Josh dumped you, he broke your heart.
- You want revenge.
- Objection.
Badgering.
- Overruled.
- This performance you're putting on this is all about revenge, isn't it, Ms. Blair?
No.
I'm telling the truth.
Really?
And which version of the truth is that?
The one where Josh Carpenter raped you?
The one where you lied to the police?
Or is it the version where you were lying before, but you're not lying now?
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.
I appreciate your candor, Ms. Blair.
So, what's it gonna take to make this to go away?
Give me a number.
I'm kidding.
Just a little icebreaker.
Had you, huh?
This is an awkward situation.
- I think the world of Julie.
- Then why not give her a break?
- We both know she didn't do this.
- Unfortunately, the evidence is strong.
Well, speaking of the so-called evidence...
- The case will be decided by the board.
- But you run the show.
Which makes any prior discussion of the details inappropriate.
Fine.
But for the record, Julie is completely innocent.
Okay, so if we're not discussing the case, why am I here?
Because I care about Julie.
She's one of our top students and a terrific kid.
I'm trying to understand how this happened.
How this allegedly happened.
When students exercise poor judgment often it stems from larger issues.
- Drugs, sexual experimentation...
- That's crazy.
Forgive me, but from what Julie told me, you're busy with your legal practice.
So?
It's just that your ex-wife seemed more active in Julie's life.
- But she's in New York now.
- Exactly.
So with all these changes, it could be that Julie's feeling abandoned.
Whoa.
You are aware that Julie chose to stay in Los Angeles with me?
This is not a personal attack.
I'm sure you're doing the best you can.
- I'm capable of raising my daughter.
- I'm sure that you are.
Julie never had a problem before her mother left.
- What is this?
- Civil suit alleging defamation, slander.
- Five million dollars?
- That's just for starters.
By the time I'm done, this'll be a Burger King.
Reinstate Julie pending the hearing, I drop the suit.
Well, I guess I know how you got your nickname.
And if I were you, I'd take the deal.
Because during all those years when I was being a lousy, irresponsible father I somehow became this bitchen lawyer.
- Ho-ho.
I'm not feeling the love, people.
- We're toast.
I've read the transcript.
Sydney got torn apart on cross.
- Big time.
- Not a shock.
- But we still have Tandi Parker.
- Uh, well, you know, about that.
Please tell me we didn't lose Tandi Parker.
- I wish I could.
- Instead, you're gonna tell me?
Snuck into court and refuses to testify.
Why?
Maybe the same reason prisoners don't cut in line to the gas chamber.
You guys are right, we're toast.
Subpoena Tandi, force her to testify that they raped her.
She'll just deny it.
We're already on thin ice with the jury.
Okay, I may be reaching.
I've been going over the details of Tandi's statement.
She says she got away from Freeman and Taylor, made a break for the door.
But there was someone standing outside.
They used a lookout.
So two different women were raped by the same two guys at the same location.
If their MO is consistent, that means...
Ladies and gentlemen, we could have an unknown eyewitness.
Run.
All right.
- Cross back, cross back.
- Come on, keep your head up.
That's not bad, I'll chase you more.
What are you guys doing here?
We know you were in the hall when Sydney went into the rec room.
- So?
- Lf you were involved, come clean.
You think I was part of this?
Look, I tried to help you.
- I'm out of here.
- Nelson, I believe you didn't do this.
I just think you know more than you've told me.
- I told you everything that I saw.
- You didn't tell us about the lookout.
We know there was someone outside that door when Sydney was being raped.
Someone who was making sure that Taylor and Freeman weren't interrupted.
Who was it, Nelson?
Look, don't make me do this.
You know I feel bad about Sydney.
This isn't about Sydney.
One day, this could be your wife or your daughter...
- I know...
- No, you don't know, I know.
When I was 11, we had to live with my aunt in St. Louis.
And she was seeing this guy, Larry.
Larry was big and handsome.
Always laughing, playing around, telling jokes.
But the joke was on me, because one night handsome Larry came into my room and he got into bed with me.
And this went on for 10 months because I was too scared to say anything.
And then one day, my brother saw us and he called the cops.
It just takes one person who's not afraid.
Who was the lookout?
It was Josh Carpenter.
There's a special place in hell for Josh Carpenter.
Before you call Dante, let's run this down.
- Nelson's statement puts Carpenter at the scene...
But outside the action.
Use Carpenter as a material witness against Taylor and Freeman.
- He may not be willing to cooperate.
- We charge him till it hurts.
His false statement to the cops, perjury, obstruction...
More.
Jeffries isn't gonna bend over for misdemeanors.
Let's take our chances with the jury.
Prosecute Josh Carpenter separately as an accessory to rape.
No record.
He'll walk away with a slap on the wrist.
No.
Not necessarily.
In his statement, Nelson Moore said:
"I approached Josh.
Asked if everything was cool.
He looked around, said it was.
Told me to take off."
Okay, so in effect, Josh Carpenter prevented Nelson from aiding Sydney Blair.
Making him an active participant as culpable as the others.
Rape in concert, very creative.
Just one problem.
Without Carpenter's testimony, no jury will convict these guys of rape.
And without a rape conviction, there's no standing for rape in concert.
Okay, we've got two options:
Plan A, we go after Taylor and Freeman for rape without Carpenter's testimony and then charge Carpenter with rape in concert.
If we're extremely lucky, we nail all three.
If we're not, they all walk.
Plan B, we use the rape in concert charge to leverage a deal with Josh Carpenter.
And then force him to testify...
Which strengthens our case, but lets a lying jerk go free.
Let's go talk to Sydney Blair.
Wait, I don't understand.
He was outside the door standing watch.
- That can't be true.
- I'm afraid it is.
Oh, my God.
I mean, I knew Josh was angry.
But to stand there and let those animals attack me, I...
Look, our problem is this.
We can't prove that Josh knew what was going on inside that room.
But if we offer him a deal, we can secure his testimony against Taylor and Freeman.
Does that mean Josh would get away with what he did?
Look, I mean this has been in the press.
It will hurt his reputation and career.
- That's not what I asked.
- It means Josh won't be prosecuted.
Josh planned this.
He wanted to punish me.
He pointed me out to Brent and Seth.
He watched the door while they raped me.
Please understand this.
If we don't make a deal with Carpenter, Taylor and Freeman will be acquitted.
No one will pay for what happened to you, Sydney.
I understand, but Josh Carpenter helped them rape me.
I'm begging you, Mr. Stark.
Don't let him go.
I'm sorry.
- Mm.
What was that for?
- Getting me back into school.
Well, we still have to deal with the review board.
I know, but it's just nice to be back to the normal routine.
- Where are you headed?
- Katie and I are gonna go see a movie.
- It is a school night.
- Yeah?
It just seems like I should know where you're going just, you know, so I know.
Okay.
It's just that you never really seemed to care that much.
Well, I do.
Okay, so, can I go to the movies?
Yes.
- Okay, see you later.
- Not too late.
Right.
- No deal.
- A witness puts him at the door during a rape.
Alleged rape.
And standing by a door isn't a crime.
It is if you prevent help from going in, then lie to the cops about it.
- Then file charges.
- Trust me, I would love to.
Fine.
This meeting's over.
Josh, walk out that door, I will make you regret it for the rest of your life.
Mr. Stark's bitter.
He hasn't lost.
I'll stuff every petty offense into an indictment splash it across every sports page.
See what that does to the draft.
Even if you beat every charge, your reputation is trashed.
You'll hand the bulk of your signing bonus to Mr. Jeffries for legal fees.
Think about it.
Full immunity.
Sexual misconduct, 18 months, paroled in six.
- Out in time for draft.
- You're dreaming.
Ted, he watched a girl get raped.
Without his testimony, you have no case.
Full immunity.
I want the courtroom closed and a gag order on the jury.
I'll draw up the paperwork.
What do you want me to say?
I was pissed off that Sydney came to the party.
I was with my girlfriend, I didn't want a scene.
- What did you do?
- I asked Brent and Seth to help me.
And they took her downstairs.
- To the rec room?
- Yeah.
At first, it was cool.
Sydney was having a good time with the guys.
She wanted to leave, they wouldn't let her go.
- And you know this how?
- Because I was at the door standing guard.
And you're certain what happened in that room was rape?
Yes.
At one point, I could hear Sydney crying.
- I opened the door and...
- What did you see?
I saw Seth on top of her and Brent was holding her down.
- He looked at me and he smiled.
- So, what did you do?
Nothing.
Tell me, Josh, what kind of a person sees a young woman being raped and does nothing?
Last question, did you ever at any time consider going inside that room and joining in the rape of Sydney Blair?
- Absolutely not.
- Why didn't you?
Because I'm not a rapist.
Oh, right.
You're just the guy who guards the door.
No more questions.
Hey.
Working late?
You were really great on this case.
- A compliment.
- Strictly professional.
The way you got Nelson Moore to cooperate.
It was amazing.
- Just doing my job.
- It was more than that.
You were willing to share this horrible secret so he'd do the right thing.
- That took a lot of guts.
- Actually, it took a lot of imagination.
I don't have an aunt.
I've never been to St. Louis.
I just made it up.
Why would you lie about something like that?
I said what he needed to hear.
- You look disappointed.
- Of course not.
I guess I thought maybe I was starting to understand you a little.
Intimacy's overrated.
You wanna grab a drink?
I think I'm gonna pass tonight.
I'm a little tired.
Suit yourself.
Five years apiece for first degree rape.
They'll be out in three.
Considering where we started, good verdict.
Except for Josh Carpenter walking away scot free.
Obviously, I'm disappointed that my teammates were involved in something as horrible as this.
Josh, can you tell us why you decided to testify?
At the end of the day, I had to do the right thing.
- I say we kick his ass.
- Now you're talking.
Much as I'd love to see that, he's not worth it.
The world's not fair, guys.
Just take yes for an answer and move on.
Aren't you gonna say "I told you so"?
- No.
- Wise choice.
Josh, what's your playing status?
Pretty serious expression.
I'm just thinking about everything.
You know, from now on, I'm gonna be more involved in your life.
School, hobbies, everything.
I'd really like that.
We're gonna get through this, Jules, trust me.
That review board won't know what hit them.
- Thank you.
- I haven't done anything yet.
Oh, but you have.
Everybody doubted me.
My teachers doubted me, my friends.
I even started doubting myself.
But you were the only one who still believed in me.
It only took me 16 years to show it.
Dad, I plagiarized that paper.
I got distracted and ran out of time.
I just downloaded it off the Internet.
I'm so sorry.
You are about to take a trip back in time to a world that existed before "Prehistoric Park".
This is an epic adventure into the minds of the team who dared to imagine the impossible.
Journey with us through the making of "Prehistoric Park"
and learn the secrets of the series from the people who refused to let sleeping dinosaurs lie.
"Prehistoric Park" is not a zoo.
"Prehistoric Park" is like the ultimate Wildlife sanctuary.
A sanctuary Where We're not just bringing giant pandas back from the brink,
We're looking after extinct animals, so it's the most incredible Wildlife conservation project.
There's an adage that conservationists use Which is "extinction is for ever", so We turned that on its head and thought, "What if extinction didn't have to be for ever?
"What if you could bring back the creatures
"that We've lost over the billions of years since life began?"
Then you think, "how do We bring them back
"and how do We look after them?"
Once the big brains had the concept for the series, it was time to find an explorer to cope with perilous environments, who could deal with being charged at by a massive dinosaur or ten.
That person was Nigel Marven.
Every zoologist Would love to go back in time and since I've been knee-high to a grasshopper, I've thought how fantastic it Would be to see dinosaurs.
I love living reptiles, but imagine finding a Deinosuchus, a 65-foot crocodile, amazing things that lived in the past, and to bring them back to the present day, every naturalist's dream!
But the team now had what seemed like an impossible obstacle to overcome.
How on earth were they going to travel back in time?
(James) Einstein made a big deal about space and time and time-travel.
I think in reality he knew really like We do now that it's quite simple.
You just need a stick With lights on it.
You stick that in the ground, the time portal comes up and you go back in time.
So that's What We did.
Come on!
Come on, T-Rex!
(Roars)
Once the team had the Nobel Prize winning, time-travel solution in hand, they had another tricky task.
They had to find the perfect location for "Prehistoric Park".
We recced lots of zoos and sanctuaries to get our ideas.
It Was important that the "Prehistoric Park" audience don't feel sorry that these creatures have come from open landscapes 65 million years ago to a tiny little pen, so We Worked hard at creating a place
We thought prehistoric animals Would like to be.
What it needed Was a sub-tropical climate.
Lots of the creatures Were reptiles that rely on external sources of heat.
We needed the right mosaic of habitats With big cliffs surrounding the Park, so if animals did escape, Which, fingers crossed, they Won't, they'll be kept in by the geography.
These unusual creatures would have unusual problems.
Who would make sure they stayed healthy?
They advertised in a proper veterinary journal - it Was in With all the other job ads for a horse vet and a dog vet.
It said, "Do you Want to be a dinosaur vet?"
I thought it Was quite cool.
If looking after their wellbeing was going to be hard, running the Park would seem to be impossible.
With thousands of tons of lizard heading their way, the team needed an actor to play Bob, the park-keeper.
Can you get a ten-foot pole at the bottom of the paddock?
Check everything cos it's home to a dangerous creature.
What sort of person Were they looking at to play Bob?
There's a question!
I think they Wanted someone...
good-looking, suave, debonair.
No, With avuncular qualities, somebody Warm With an interest in the history of the dinosaurs, someone With a genuine love of animals of all sorts, someone that liked the outdoors, that liked the sweltering heat of South Africa.
Just basically me, I think!
It's not always totally serious around Bob.
Things go Wrong around Bob and he has to run around fixing it.
So With Bob We used to play a bit.
Bob the park-keeper would deal with creatures like the troublesome Titanosaur and Matilda and Terence, the tricky T-Rex.
You'd have to be very brave to look after two baby T-Rexes.
They're very hungry because they're growing so fast, so they need a lot of food to grow.
They're constantly looking for an easy meal and an unwary park-keeper might make a good snack for a baby T-Rex.
But what was Nigel going to rescue?
The team had to decide what the viewers would want to see in "Prehistoric Park".
They had the luxury of choosing from the past 500 million years.
(LoW-pitched cries)
Choosing the animals for the Park Was difficult and a real joy for me, but We Wanted the famous extinct creatures, the Sabre-toothed cats, T-Rex, the ultimate predator.
T-Rex is the most famous dinosaur of all time because it's thought to be the largest ever predator.
Anything With teeth 30 centimetres long Will catch the imagination of people interested in the fantastic and the terrible.
We also thought We'd spin in a few different ones.
Some of the latest research is into dino-birds found in China.
There's this crazy thing called a Microraptor With four Wings.
No one's ever seen these things realised in any form at all.
It Was a chance to say,
"This is brand-neW to science.
Let's see What they're like."
It was like a prehistoric detective agency in the production office.
The researchers and directors were reading all the latest papers and were speaking to the key experts to piece together the life and death of the stars of the show.
Palaeontologists have many different clues.
Starting With the fossil record, We have the bones, the skeletons of the animals.
We can look at those and compare them With those of living animals.
We also have some indirect lines of evidence coming from "trace fossils".
Trace fossils are non-body remains such as footprints, eggs, burrows and even prehistoric poo.
Nigel travelled to Scotland to find out more.
There's two rows of tracks here, one along here and the other one down here.
This is 36 centimetres Wide, so it must have been made by a large animal.
This is a real Scottish treasure.
There's not many of these in the World.
No, there's only a handful of this age.
It Was made by Arthropleura, a giant extinct millipede.
I think of these things as Palaeo-Polaroids or snapshots in time of the activities of these animals.
We're seeing preserved on this surface a fleeting moment of What happened 300 million years ago.
These ancient creepy-crawlies were C-List celebrities.
But this was about to change as they earn their new-found status as the rock stars of "Prehistoric Park".
But before any of these became 3-D creatures, they were trapped in a 2-D world on one man's drawing board.
(James) At the beginning of the process,
We sit around With our fevered imaginations and think, "What animals do We bring back, What are they gonna do?
"Imagine a dinosaur getting pregnant or a mammoth needing a haircut!"
LeWie, the storyboard artist, takes these mad thoughts and turns them into something people can understand.
(NeW speaker) Storyboarding is one of my favourite parts of the process because it's there that you're making the programme, the film.
It's actually a time Where you can throw in as many ideas as you Want and if you've got a talented storyboard artist like We did,
When you get the boards coming back to you and you look at them, you think, "This is how We'll film it and how it Will look."
If you've got a document you can go back to every now and then to remind you What you're supposed to be doing Without any ambiguity, it ensures that you'll get What you knew you Wanted in the first place,
Which can so easily start going awry in the chaos of filming.
One by one, Nigel's extraordinary adventures were coming to life, from the hot swamps of the Carboniferous to the freezing temperatures of the ice Age.
(Trumpeting)
(Marven) Programme two, very exciting for me, Woolly Mammoths.
We know a lot about them because they Were preserved in the permafrost.
They only became extinct relatively recently, 1 0,000 years ago, and you can find out about their DNA.
Palaeontologists believe they are very close in their social behaviour to elephants.
But building a mammoth was not as simple as dressing an elephant in a hairy coat.
They had to come up with a more controllable beast.
To create animals from nothing you need something.
We used animatronics, Which is a life-size puppet.
So they turned to a company called "Crawley Creatures", experts in hi-tech rubber models of all shapes and sizes.
When I first saw the animatronics...
Sorry, squeaky chair, start again!
When I first saw the quality of the animatronics, I Was stunned.
The skill, the quality, the sculpture, the electronics that go into operating them is breathtaking.
There's no magic any more.
They can do it. lt's brilliant.
Sightings of the rubber dinosaurs were reported around the globe, from Chile and Florida to Brazil and South Africa.
Wherever they went, a team of operators followed.
Not only did they have to look good, they needed the right moves.
I think even a slower move round and more of an amalgamation of different kinds of moves on her.
So push her forward a little bit, move her, rock her.
Martha the Mammoth Was mostly computer animation, but there Were some moments that she had to be an animatronic as We Were looking for an interaction.
- Action!
- (Man) Wag your ear!
The elephant was led up towards the animatronic mammoth which was hidden until the last moment.
(Kelly) The handler told us the elephant
Will ignore the animatronic mammoth or go crazy!
We Waited With baited breath and then something amazing happened.
The elephant believed our mammoth Was real and she stretched out her trunk and tried to interact With her.
Everybody believed that Martha, just for a little moment, Was really real.
1 3 animatronics were used throughout the series, but the majority of the creatures were created by computer graphic geniuses working at "Framestore".
(James) We've Worked With "Framestore" in the past
When We did "Walking With Dinosaurs"
and by Working With them together over the last six to eight years,
We've kept pushing the boundaries about What you can do With factual programmes.
The "Framestore"team needed environments, so the directors spent months filming nothing, but doing everything to build this fantastic world.
To create a shot With computer animation in it, you shoot a back plate, an empty shot Without animation.
If you Want a moving shot, you have to not just shoot a single back plate, but shoot several back plates, to sew them together and move through the shot.
In this shot We put a pole in With a little ball on the top, just to give Nigel an eye line.
If the actor's looking in the Wrong place, you don't believe the shot.
So in this case he's looking at What Will soon be Martha.
(Marven) You imagine you're looking a Woolly Mammoth dead in the eyes!
(Arthur) Acting With nothing is unusual, but you get used to it When you're doing it every day.
You sort of have to build your own World,
Which all these fantasy creatures live in, this invisible World.
Come on, it's time to meet your public.
I knew I could do it.
I think I had the temperature too low, but these two have finally hatched out.
The rascals are following me everywhere!
I Was the first thing they saw and they think I'm their mam!
I do talk to my dog at home all the time, so I talk to them like I talk to Frankie.
Tuck in...
Steady now, come on!
Don't bolt your food.
If you eat that quickly, you'll get Wind!
It's not easy being a mother!
That's What I did and it seemed to Work.
It's a Triceratops!
We've done it!
Our first dinosaur, look at him!
He's magnificent.
Hold it, hold it, calm down.
While Nigel and the actors were imagining what the creatures will look like, back in London the "Framestore"team are starting to build the creatures and bring them to life.
When We build our creatures, We start With a physical maquette,
Which is sculpted.
It is important for everyone to see What We're looking at.
This maquette is scanned in using a laser and the information is transferred onto computer.
Once that comes in, you build an internal skeleton to make the Whole creature move and this allows the animators to animate freely.
Once the scanning is complete, the animators take these virtual beings and breathe life into them.
This is where the creatures take their first few steps and eventually run, jump, fly or swim.
It's like taking hold of a creature and just posing it in certain Ways, taking a snapshot of that and moving the time slider on.
Similar to stop-frame animation, but We don't have to redo it each time it's filmed.
We can re-import these positions on to other creatures.
But a very strange creature was complex to animate and even harder to pronounce.
Parasauro...
lophus.
Parasaurolophus.
Parasaurolophus.
Parasaur...olophus.
Parasauro...
Parasaurolo...phus.
Parasophalus.
Parasauro...
Parasaurolophorus.
No.
Parasaurolophus.
No, it's not in my programme!
The Parasaurolophus might have moved in a number of Ways.
It mainly Walks on two legs.
The hind legs are massive, but the front legs are not so strong.
(Glasbey) What We believe it does, and What looks very natural, is it Will Walk on four legs.
A similar gait to a camel because of the structure of the creature, but once it gets up to speed, it Would shift its Weight backwards, lift up and then run on its back legs.
It Would be a very strange creature to run on all four legs.
It looks like they Would get tangled up.
But not all of their walks made it into the programme.
But to make it look real, you have to have physical interactions.
You have to have the creature looking like it's kicking something or kicking some bones on the ground, so We shoot physical interactions.
(Bennett) ln the new Zealand shoot, episode 3, We had an actor, Morgan, and We have a scene Where he's attacked by the Mei Long,
Which are these vicious dinosaurs, like a pack of Wild dogs.
And for that interaction We actually had to pull him backwards through a hedge.
Aagh!
Aagh!
Aagh!
Aagh!
Aagh!
Aagh!
Help me!
We did about ten takes in the end and this poor guy is getting pulled through clean off his feet about six foot by this enormous stunt co-ordinator and that interaction is What these programmes are all about.
You imagine you are standing next to enormous dinosaurs and it's amazing how quickly our actors and presenters get into that.
Aagh!
Aagh!
Help me!
They're after the food.
Get your bag off!
Get off!
Help me!
Aagh, get off!
Aagh!
Help!
Aagh!
Aagh!
Help!
Oh!
They're away!
(Snapping)
While the directors were filming in exotic locations, the sound designer was shut in a small, dark room in London, making and recording strange noises.
A lot of the time We don't have any sound at all, so We have to make the Whole thing up from the Word go.
It's exciting, but it's also hard Work.
(GroWls)
We take a dinosaur Which has no sound recorded on location and We can give it our own special touch, so to speak,
With obviously a bit of authenticity entwined With it.
(Thumping)
Big Whack if We Were creating the T-Rex sound.
See What you have to do for your job?
(Crunches)
That's biting the bones and What have you.
You've got to have good teeth for this job and do other horrible dinosaurs.
Back on location, thousands of elements were being filmed by the directors and fed back to "Framestore".
The magic is pulling these pictures together in "compositing".
In this next sequence Nigel gets chased by a Tyrannosaurus Rex and runs right past a pen of crocodiles.
It Was dangerous to have Nigel running past them, so We shot them separately.
There they are.
And I made a lot of noise off-screen to get a reaction for When the T-Rex runs past.
We then shot Nigel against a blue screen and then put the elements together.
Then in the finished shot We had a footprint, a bit of stuff being kicked off.
A bit of camera move, a bit of shake When the T-Rex's foot hits the ground.
Putting these shows together is like a giant jigsaw puzzle and in the final scene, that amazing chase
When Matilda the T-Rex escapes, she runs past crocodiles chasing me, that Was done in South Africa.
The next shot We cut to Deinosuchus, the prehistoric crocodile, erupting out of the Water and saving my life by distracting Matilda.
That Was done in Australia, so you have to think about how the stories flow together.
They can be shot in many locations.
The Deinosuchus was one of the creatures
Nigel was really looking forward to meeting.
I've done a lot With living crocodiles and alligators.
The largest crocodile alive today, the saltwater crocodile, is 25 feet long, but just imagine deinosuchus, a crocodile 60 feet long!
That's a crocodile that actually hunts dinosaurs.
(James) Every time We do CG Work, We push the boundaries more.
And I think one that's definitely causing them cause for some concern is this crocodile roll We're doing.
It took an enormous amount of preparation.
It shows you What goes into CG.
Nine, ten months before the shoot,
We Were having hour-long meetings about how to achieve this shot.
(James) lt's something We never tried before, showing a giant crocodile rolling in the Water as it does a death roll.
This could get the prize as the hardest shot in the programme.
The Deinosuchus roll.
We've been dreading it ever since We saw the storyboard, how We'll film it and composite the Whole thing.
The interactions are very difficult With all these splashes.
(Thompson) To make things even harder for Sirio, I shot it in sloW-motion, so everybody can stare in loving detail at every frame.
The shot's not quite finished and my fingers are crossed that it Will come out OK.
(Sirio ) People ask, "Do you have to do stuff frame by frame?"
It gets Worse.
Sometimes it's pixel by pixel!
It Would be easier if We had a 50-foot prehistoric crocodile to film for real!
But there Wasn't time!
But finally, the Deinosuchus was ready to rock and roll!
It's leapt out there.
The Parasaurolophus is being dragged back.
(Groans)
(LoW-pitched cries)
With the deadly Deinosuchus roll complete, it was time for the icing on the prehistoric pudding.
Composer Daniel Pemberton spent a year in a flurry of staves, crotchets and quavers.
He worked with the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra to tell an epic musical story that would guide us through 300 million years of prehistoric life.
Making "Prehistoric Park" Was an amazing experience.
Sometimes it pushed us to the limit.
We Were in very difficult conditions, dealing With real animals, CG animals, actors, hostile climates, long hours, but I think What We've made is really, really special.
"Prehistoric Park", What a roller-coaster ride, 1 50 days' filming!
Of course, you rarely see anything until you get back here.
It's so realistic.
I've always Wanted to travel in time.
It's a dream come true to see myself With these prehistoric creatures.
When I'm an old man, I'll believe I travelled back in time.
What We hope We've shown With this series is extinction doesn't have to be forever.
What is "Prehistoric Park"?
Ask me another one.
That's too hard.
...to the location We Wanted to... (Phone rings)
The phone's down there, is it?
Hello?
No, she's not.
Certainly the tractor scene
Where We allow the... the, er...
Tyrannosaur...
Was it the Tyrannosaur?
For example, on the tractor,
When We let the... I've forgotten its name again!
Each one of our story...
Eugh!
It's quite hard. I'm always on that side and it looks so darned easy!
now I really know how hard it is!
You are about to take a trip back in time to a world that existed before "Prehistoric Park".
This is an epic adventure into the minds of the team who dared to imagine the impossible.
Journey with us through the making of "Prehistoric Park"

Every zoologist would love to go back in time and since I've been knee-high to a grasshopper,
I've thought how fantastic it would be to see dinosaurs.
I Iove living reptiles, but imagine finding a Deinosuchus, a 65-foot crocodile, amazing things that lived in the past, and to bring them back to the present day, every naturalist's dream!
But the team now had what seemed
like an impossible obstacle to overcome.
How on earth were they going to travel back in time?
(James) Einstein made a big deal about space and time and time-travel.
I think in reality he knew really like we do now that it's quite simple.
You just need a stick with lights on it.
You stick that in the ground, the time portal comes up and you go back in time.
So that's what we did.
Come on!
Come on, T-Rex!
(Roars)
Once the team had the Nobel Prize winning, time-travel solution in hand, they had another tricky task.
They had to find the perfect location for "Prehistoric Park".
We recced lots of zoos and sanctuaries to get our ideas.
It was important that the "Prehistoric Park" audience don't feel sorry that these creatures have come from open landscapes 65 million years ago to a tiny little pen, so we worked hard at creating a place we thought prehistoric animals would Iike to be.
What it needed was a sub-tropical climate.
Lots of the creatures were reptiles that rely on external sources of heat.
We needed the right mosaic of habitats with big cliffs surrounding the Park, so if animals did escape, which, fingers crossed, they won't, they'II be kept in by the geography.
These unusual creatures would have unusual problems.
Who would make sure they stayed healthy?
They advertised in a proper veterinary journal - it was in with all the other job ads for a horse vet and a dog vet.
It said, "Do you want to be a dinosaur vet?"
I thought it was quite cool.
Iflooking after their wellbeing was going to be hard, running the Park would seem to be impossible.
With thousands of tons of lizard heading their way, the team needed an actor to play Bob, the park-keeper.
Can you get a ten-foot pole at the bottom of the paddock?
Check everything cos it's home to a dangerous creature.
What sort of person were they looking at to play Bob?
There's a question!
I think they wanted someone...
good-Iooking, suave, debonair.
No, with avuncular qualities, somebody warm with an interest in the history of the dinosaurs, someone with a genuine love of animals of all sorts, someone that liked the outdoors, that liked the sweltering heat of South Africa.
Just basically me, I think!
It's not always totally serious around Bob.
Things go wrong around Bob and he has to run around fixing it.
So with Bob we used to play a bit.
Bob the park-keeper would deal with creatures like the troublesome Titanosaur and Matilda and Terence, the tricky T-Rex.
You'd have to be very brave to look after two baby T-Rexes.
They're very hungry because they're growing so fast, so they need a Iot of food to grow.
They're constantly looking for an easy meal and an unwary park-keeper might make a good snack for a baby T-Rex.
But what was Nigel going to rescue?
The team had to decide what the viewers would want to see in "Prehistoric Park".
They had the luxury of choosing from the past 500 million years.
(Low-pitched cries)
Choosing the animals for the Park was difficult and a real joy for me, but we wanted the famous extinct creatures, the Sabre-toothed cats, T-Rex, the ultimate predator.
T-Rex is the most famous dinosaur of all time because it's thought to be the largest ever predator.
Anything with teeth 30 centimetres long will catch the imagination of people interested in the fantastic and the terrible.
We also thought we'd spin in a few different ones.
Some of the latest research is into dino-birds found in China.
There's this crazy thing called a Microraptor with four wings.
No one's ever seen these things realised in any form at all.
It was a chance to say,
"This is brand-new to science.
Let's see what they're like."
It was like a prehistoric detective agency in the production office.
The researchers and directors were reading all the latest papers and were speaking to the key experts to piece together the life and death of the stars of the show.
Palaeontologists have many different clues.
Starting with the fossil record, we have the bones, the skeletons of the animals.
We can look at those and compare them with those of living animals.
We also have some indirect lines of evidence coming from "trace fossils".
Trace fossils are non-body remains such as footprints, eggs, burrows and even prehistoric poo.
Nigel travelled to Scotland to find out more.
There's two rows of tracks here, one along here and the other one down here.
This is 36 centimetres wide, so it must have been made by a Iarge animal.
This is a real Scottish treasure.
There's not many of these in the world.
No, there's only a handful of this age.
It was made by Arthropleura, a giant extinct millipede.
I think of these things as Palaeo-Polaroids or snapshots in time of the activities of these animals.
We're seeing preserved on this surface a fleeting moment of what happened 300 million years ago.
These ancient creepy-crawlies were C-List celebrities.
But this was about to change as they earn their new-found status as the rock stars of "Prehistoric Park".
But before any of these became 3-D creatures, they were trapped in a 2-D world on one man 's drawing board.
(James) At the beginning of the process, we sit around with our fevered imaginations and think, "What animals do we bring back, what are they gonna do?
"Imagine a dinosaur getting pregnant or a mammoth needing a haircut!"
Lewie, the storyboard artist, takes these mad thoughts and turns them into something people can understand.
(New speaker) Storyboarding is one of my favourite parts of the process because it's there that you're making the programme, the film.
It's actually a time where you can throw in as many ideas as you want and if you've got a talented storyboard artist like we did, when you get the boards coming back to you and you look at them,
you think, "This is how we'II film it and how it will look."
If you've got a document you can go back to every now and then to remind you what you're supposed to be doing without any ambiguity, it ensures that you'II get what you knew you wanted in the first place,
which can so easily start going awry in the chaos of filming.
One by one, Nigel's extraordinary adventures were coming to life, from the hot swamps of the Carboniferous to the freezing temperatures of the ice Age.
(Trumpeting)
(Marven) Programme two, very exciting for me, Woolly Mammoths.
We know a Iot about them because they were preserved in the permafrost.
They only became extinct relatively recently, 10,000 years ago, and you can find out about their DNA.
Palaeontologists believe they are very close in their social behaviour to elephants.
But building a mammoth was not as simple as dressing an elephant in a hairy coat.
They had to come up with a more controllable beast.
To create animals from nothing you need something.
We used animatronics, which is a Iife-size puppet.
So they turned to a company called "Crawley Creatures", experts in hi-tech rubber models of all shapes and sizes.
When I first saw the animatronics...
Sorry, squeaky chair, start again!
When I first saw the quality of the animatronics, I was stunned.
The skill, the quality, the sculpture, the electronics that go into operating them is breathtaking.
There's no magic any more.
They can do it.
It's brilliant.
Sightings ofthe rubber dinosaurs were reported around the globe, from Chile and Florida to Brazil and South Africa.
Wherever they went, a team of operators followed.
Not only did they have to look good, they needed the right moves.
I think even a slower move round and more of an amalgamation of different kinds of moves on her.
So push her forward a Iittle bit, move her, rock her.
Martha the Mammoth was mostly computer animation, but there were some moments that she had to be an animatronic as we were looking for an interaction.
- Action!
- (Man) Wag your ear!
The elephant was led up towards the animatronic mammoth which was hidden until the last moment.
(Kelly) The handler told us the elephant will ignore the animatronic mammoth or go crazy!
We waited with baited breath and then something amazing happened.
The elephant believed our mammoth was real and she stretched out her trunk and tried to interact with her.
Everybody believed that Martha, just for a Iittle moment, was really real.
13 animatronics were used throughout the series, but the majority of the creatures were created by computer graphic geniuses working at "Framestore".
(James) We've worked with "Framestore" in the past when we did "Walking with Dinosaurs"
and by working with them together over the Iast six to eight years, we've kept pushing the boundaries about what you can do with factual programmes.
The "Framestore"team needed environments, so the directors spent months filming nothing, but doing everything to build this fantastic world.
To create a shot with computer animation in it, you shoot a back plate, an empty shot without animation.
If you want a moving shot, you have to not just shoot a single back plate, but shoot several back plates, to sew them together and move through the shot.
In this shot we put a pole in with a Iittle ball on the top, just to give Nigel an eye line.
If the actor's looking in the wrong place, you don't believe the shot.
So in this case he's looking at what will soon be Martha.
(Marven) You imagine you're looking a Woolly Mammoth dead in the eyes!
(Arthur) Acting with nothing is unusual, but you get used to it when you're doing it every day.
You sort of have to build your own world, which all these fantasy creatures live in, this invisible world.
Come on, it's time to meet your public.
I knew I could do it.
I think I had the temperature too low, but these two have finally hatched out.
The rascals are following me everywhere!
I was the first thing they saw and they think I'm their mam!
I do talk to my dog at home all the time, so I talk to them like I talk to Frankie.
Tuck in...
Steady now, come on!
Don't bolt your food.
If you eat that quickly, you'II get wind!
It's not easy being a mother!
That's what I did and it seemed to work.
It's a Triceratops!
We've done it!
Our first dinosaur, look at him!
He's magnificent.
Hold it, hold it, calm down.
While Nigel and the actors were imagining what the creatures will look like, back in London the "Framestore"team are starting to build the creatures and bring them to life.
When we build our creatures, we start with a physical maquette, which is sculpted.
It is important for everyone to see what we're looking at.
This maquette is scanned in using a laser and the information is transferred onto computer.
Once that comes in, you build an internal skeleton to make the whole creature move and this allows the animators to animate freely.
Once the scanning is complete, the animators take these virtual beings and breathe life into them.
This is where the creatures take their first few steps and eventually run, jump, fly or swim.
It's like taking hold of a creature and just posing it in certain ways, taking a snapshot of that and moving the time slider on.
Similar to stop-frame animation, but we don't have to redo it each time it's filmed.
We can re-import these positions on to other creatures.
But a very strange creature was complex to animate and even harder to pronounce.
Parasauro...
Iophus.
Parasaurolophus.
Parasaurolophus.
Parasaur...olophus.
Parasauro...
Parasaurolo...phus.
Parasophalus.
Parasauro...
Parasaurolophorus.
No.
Parasaurolophus.
No, it's not in my programme!
The Parasaurolophus might have moved in a number of ways.
It mainly walks on two legs.
The hind legs are massive, but the front legs are not so strong.
(GIasbey) What we believe it does, and what looks very natural, is it will walk on four legs.
A similar gait to a camel because of the structure of the creature, but once it gets up to speed, it would shift its weight backwards,
lift up and then run on its back legs.
It would be a very strange creature to run on all four legs.
It looks like they would get tangled up.
But not all oftheir walks made it into the programme.
But to make it look real, you have to have physical interactions.
You have to have the creature looking like it's kicking something or kicking some bones on the ground, so we shoot physical interactions.
(Bennett) In the New Zealand shoot, episode 3, we had an actor, Morgan, and we have a scene where he's attacked by the Mei Long, which are these vicious dinosaurs, Iike a pack of wild dogs.
And for that interaction we actually had to pull him backwards through a hedge.
Aagh!
Aagh!
Aagh!
Aagh!
Aagh!
Aagh!
Help me!
We did about ten takes in the end and this poor guy is getting pulled through clean off his feet about six foot by this enormous stunt co-ordinator and that interaction is what these programmes are all about.
You imagine you are standing next to enormous dinosaurs and it's amazing how quickly our actors and presenters get into that.
Aagh!
Aagh!
Help me!
They're after the food.
Get your bag off!
Get off!
Help me!
Aagh, get off!
Aagh!
Help!
Aagh!
Aagh!
Help!
Oh!
They're away!
(Snapping)
While the directors were filming in exotic locations, the sound designer was shut in a small, dark room in London, making and recording strange noises.
A Iot of the time we don't have any sound at all, so we have to make the whole thing up from the word go.
It's exciting, but it's also hard work.
(Growls)
We take a dinosaur which has no sound recorded on location and we can give it our own special touch, so to speak, with obviously a bit of authenticity entwined with it.
(Thumping)
Big whack if we were creating the T-Rex sound.
See what you have to do for your job?
(Crunches)
That's biting the bones and what have you.
You've got to have good teeth for this job and do other horrible dinosaurs.
Back on location, thousands of elements were being filmed by the directors and fed back to "Framestore".
The magic is pulling these pictures together in "compositing".
In this next sequence Nigel gets chased by a Tyrannosaurus Rex and runs right past a pen of crocodiles.
It was dangerous to have Nigel running past them, so we shot them separately.
There they are.
And I made a Iot of noise off-screen to get a reaction for when the T-Rex runs past.
We then shot Nigel against a blue screen and then put the elements together.
Then in the finished shot we had a footprint, a bit of stuff being kicked off.
A bit of camera move, a bit of shake when the T-Rex's foot hits the ground.
Putting these shows together is like a giant jigsaw puzzle and in the final scene, that amazing chase when Matilda the T-Rex escapes, she runs past crocodiles chasing me, that was done in South Africa.
The next shot we cut to Deinosuchus, the prehistoric crocodile, erupting out of the water and saving my Iife by distracting Matilda.
That was done in Australia, so you have to think about how the stories flow together.
They can be shot in many locations.
The Deinosuchus was one ofthe creatures
Nigel was really looking forward to meeting.
I've done a Iot with living crocodiles and alligators.
The largest crocodile alive today, the saltwater crocodile, is 25 feet long, but just imagine deinosuchus, a crocodile 60 feet long!
That's a crocodile that actually hunts dinosaurs.
(James) Every time we do CG work, we push the boundaries more.
And I think one that's definitely causing them cause for some concern is this crocodile roll we're doing.
It took an enormous amount of preparation.
It shows you what goes into CG.
Nine, ten months before the shoot, we were having hour-Iong meetings about how to achieve this shot.
(James) It's something we never tried before, showing a giant crocodile rolling in the water as it does a death roll.
This could get the prize as the hardest shot in the programme.
The Deinosuchus roll.
We've been dreading it ever since we saw the storyboard, how we'II film it and composite the whole thing.
The interactions are very difficult with all these splashes.
(Thompson) To make things even harder for Sirio,
I shot it in slow-motion, so everybody can stare in loving detail at every frame.
The shot's not quite finished and my fingers are crossed that it will come out OK.
(Sirio) People ask, "Do you have to do stuff frame by frame?"
It gets worse.
Sometimes it's pixel by pixel!
It would be easier if we had a 50-foot prehistoric crocodile to film for real!
But there wasn't time!
But finally, the Deinosuchus was ready to rock and roll!
It's Ieapt out there.
The Parasaurolophus is being dragged back.
(Groans)
(Low-pitched cries)
With the deadly Deinosuchus roll complete, it was time for the icing on the prehistoric pudding.
Composer Daniel Pemberton spent a year in a flurry of staves, crotchets and quavers.
He worked with the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra to tell an epic musical story that would guide us through 300 million years of prehistoric life.
Making "Prehistoric Park" was an amazing experience.
Sometimes it pushed us to the limit.
We were in very difficult conditions, dealing with real animals, CG animals, actors, hostile climates, long hours, but I think what we've made is really, really special.
"Prehistoric Park", what a roller-coaster ride, 150 days' filming!
Of course, you rarely see anything until you get back here.
It's so realistic.
I've always wanted to travel in time.
It's a dream come true to see myself with these prehistoric creatures.
When I'm an old man, I'II believe I travelled back in time.
What we hope we've shown with this series is extinction doesn't have to be forever.
What is "Prehistoric Park"?
Ask me another one.
That's too hard.
...to the location we wanted to... (Phone rings)
The phone's down there, is it?
Hello?
No, she's not.
Certainly the tractor scene where we allow the... the, er...
Tyrannosaur...
Was it the Tyrannosaur?
For example, on the tractor, when we let the...
I've forgotten its name again!
Each one of our story...
Eugh!
It's quite hard.
I'm always on that side and it looks so darned easy!
Now I really know how hard it is!
This week on Time Trumpet:
Why Sebastian Coe went to prison for murder.
It's 2031 and we've achieved so much, we're actually running out of things to do.
NASA has Just sent a probe up to Mars to find the £5 note they hid there two years earlier.
Richard Branson's cloned himself to stand at street corners hitting his groin with a hammer, Just because he could.
And David Beckham's decided to turn himself into a centaur.
...and then the body of an 'eadless 'orse was grafted below my spine.
Er... same surgeon that did Victoria's boobs, actually.
But 30 years ago, Britons behaved a lot differently.
Everybody was jacking off all the time, with their hands.
They'd touch it with their hands.
You remember all the... the celebrity sex tapes,
- Abi Titmuss, that nurse, Pamela Anderson.
- Ah, yeah.
- Phill Jupitus with Sally Gunnell.
- Aye.
Television in the first part of the 21st century was awash with sex, and behaviour previously thought of as unacceptable now became standard early-evening entertainment.
(Woman) The Jamaican street prostitute gets a good start, taking an early lead, followed by the Russian tochka girl... (Man) Hardly able to believe my Journey may soon be at an end,
I sit down and take one last look around.
It is a lovely spot for a wank, but I'm still nervous.
There's a yacht nearby, and if people had binoculars they could see me from the opposite coast.
Then I think, "To hell with it!" and I go for my flies.
I'm about to begin when...
- (Man shouts) ...I hear a shout from the woods and I'm forced to abort.
(Man) This week, Paul...
(Armando) Standards were in decline and the depravity of television was soon exposed
In the series TV Uncovered.
So, come on, tell us.
Who are you going to be tonight?
My name's Ed Blaney and I appeared on Stars In Their Eyes as David Bowie.
- (Applause)
- Ed Blaney is David Bowie!
(Ed) That night I discovered the lookalikes are not lookalikes at all.
It's the biggest and bloodiest scandal in television history.
(Armando) Stars In Their Eyes was exposed as a sham.
One of its contestants revealed that all members of the public who went on it were killed backstage and replaced by the actual stars they were meant to be Impersonating.
(Ed) I was a bit upset that none of the other performers had come to wish me good luck.
But as I went back towards the studio to go on, I bumped into the real David Bowie.
Honestly, it was like looking in a mirror.
I said, "Oh, my God!
It's you!
I'm your biggest fan."
And he just gestured behind him and whispered, "Run!"
I looked past him and there were men in black with balaclavas putting the body of the Leo Sayer lookalike in a crate.
They spotted me and ran towards me.
But luckily I was thinking and I yelled, "I'm David Bowle!
"This is the lookalike, you fools!"
So they pounced on the real David Bowie, and in the confusion I was able to escape.
Cat Deeley came in as I was running out and she started screaming, " Kill him!
Kill him!
"He'll tell the world!"
I found some stairs and just kept running down and down, out into the car park, tears streaming down my face so I could barely see where I was going.
Every person you've ever seen on that show was slaughtered and replaced by the real stars, and even now no one believes me.
Granada said I must have wandered into a rehearsal for Harry Hill's TV Burp.
But I know what I saw.
I saw death.
I agree with you.
I'm sorry, but I do.
With violence on Stars In Their Eyes and sex everywhere else, a moral backlash ensued.
Christian pressure groups forced broadcasters to clean up their act, leading to this.
- It's a gorgeous colour.
- Thank you.
And the shape is very flattering to you.
And of course Jesus loves a low-cut top and so do I.
Soon the BBC became officially Christian.
I'll be back with the headlines after we've joined our news teams where you are.
Amen.
I think that was about the time Nigella Lawson was executed for witchcraft.
Thanks for coming on, Grace.
Thank you.
Next week's guests are the heathen Sanjeev Bhaskar,
Christ-killer Paul Simon, and the sodomite Ian McKellen.
See you then.
But with more revelations from TV Uncovered, the religious bubble burst.
(Woman) The bishop was like a demon In-between takes.
There was one young girl who he got around the throat, and he told her, "Choke or sing."
(Sighs) Choke or sing.
It was a good 20 minutes they stopped filming before she got her colour back.
In-between the takes, the warm-up guy would say a number from one to ten.
If you got the corresponding Commandment, he threw you a chocolate Jesus.
Yeah, there was one poor old gentleman.
He was forced to give a sample from his catheter bag, to prove he'd been at communion that morning.
We were singing as well as we could, but it was never enough.
The producers said if they could have done it all with computers, then they would have.
Faced with the Asian crisis, then the IT collapse, then a stock-exchange crash, a house-price bubble, rising world oil prices... 2011 was a time of great hope and optimism, though you wouldn't think that if you listened to the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown.
...a doubling as we've seen of oil prices, parents struggling, society weakened, culture depleted, prosperity diminished...
In contrast, David Cameron presented a much more appealing image of youth and vitality.
Here he is taking the Tories to an Ocean Colour Scene tribute concert.
(Music playing)
I was on the Breakfast News talking about the overlighting of our cities, and I thought it would get the message home stronger if I painted part of my face blue like Michael Stipe from REM.
Well, that completely backfired and everybody just kept asking why have I painted my face blue.
I tried to get them back to the overlighting but, um... they weren't having any of that.
Cameron was popular because he was young.
This was a time when only the young mattered.
BBC3 soon launched a competition for sitcoms written by two-year-olds.
(Man) And it was up to then BBC3 controller Stuart Murphy to get in touch with the winner
- and losers.
- (Phone rings)
(Boy burbles)
- Hi, is that James Donoghue?
- Uh... yeah, hullo.
Hiya.
It's, er...
Stuart Murphy, Controller of BBC3.
What do you want, Murphy?
It was a really tough competition, er... as I'm sure you know... (Whispers) This man's a jerk.
...but, you know, I was just calling to tell you that you're the winner.
Yeah, big deal.
Channel 4 retaliated by having Its entertainment programmes commissioned by someone who was only 18 months old.
Here's one of his successful commissions.
Hello, and welcome to the seventh series of My Name Is Phil, where I try and dupe unsuspecting members of the public into thinking that my name is Phil.
It isn't.
It's Will.
Hello.
My name's Phil.
- My name's Phil.
- Right.
Hello, Phil.
It isn't.
It's Will.
- Hello, Will.
- Phwill!
- Hello.
My name is Phil.
- Hello, Phil.
It's not.
My name's Will.
- (Both laugh)
- Phwill!
- Hello.
My name is Phil.
- (Both) Hello, Phil.
- It's not.
It's Will.
- (Woman) Very funny.
- Am I supposed to say something back?
- Er... that's kind of it.
Phil or Will!
Who am I?
Soon the media was flooded by things shot by young people.
These included increasingly dangerous stunts.
Brilliant!
Watch out!
Stupid stuff shot on a mobile phone was all the rage and became more and more elaborate.
It was hard for normal television to compete with this hunger for shocking quick danger.
Some tried.
Magic man David Blaine hooked all his nerve endings up to the internet so he could be controlled online for 40 days by anyone who connected with him.
The public killed him In less than three seconds.
- Still get sponsorship and so on?
- Oh, it's an advertiser's dream.
You see, aside from, um...
Pepsi, mobile phones and sunglasses,
I'm now the face of tacking equipment, ketamine and hay.
And the thing with Tom Cruise.
His contracts became more and more stringent.
You weren't allowed to look...
- at him on screen.
- Mm-hm.
And everyone just had to pretend that he was taller than them, which meant that everyone else on a Tom Cruise set
- had to basically do the film on their knees.
- Mm.
And so, you know, you couldn't do a chase sequence with him any more.
I've read every book that's ever been written.
Test me.
You'd have a film like Ml5 and he would be on the ground, everyone else would be in a ditch
- and they'd have to CGI feet onto them.
- Mm-hm.
But it just meant everyone's feet were put on at about here.
I like Portuguese men.
Dark eyes, deep, like a forest.
You know... you know the Portuguese invented printing, invented fireworks.
The Portuguese discovered Europe.
I bet you'd never read that in a history book, and you won't.
And you know the reason?
Modesty.
Which I think is the true mark of a man, which is something you'd better remember the next time you try to jerk with me!
As an election drew nearer, David Cameron tried harder to appeal to young people.
(Woman) Cameron kept doing his stunts.
You know, he... he went sledging.
Er... he bivouacked.
He learnt to make a fishing rod in the woods with Ray Mears.
Oh, and he... he told Richard and Judy how to recycle condoms.
Diana Tinkman succeeded Nick Griffin as head of the BNP in 2010 amid a growth in support for the party.
Some people say that the BNP were racist.
But if being racist means a sustained campaign of violence against blacks and Asians, then I'm probably a bit racist as well.
But we got round the religious hatred bill.
We said things like "All blacks are wicked", and when challenged, we said, "Well, we're just using the street slang.
"They're wicked, you know?"
But then Nick Griffin went on record saying that all of Islam was a bunch of wankers and he claimed it was Cockney rhyming slang, but he hadn't worked out what for.
Crunch of clankers?
Lunch of bankers?
He was still trying to work it out when they sent him down for seven years, and that's where I came in.
Tinkman relaunched the BNP, emphasising their green policies.
She made members look like they cared for the environment by riding around on bikes.
It proved a vote-winner.
I mean, all of a sudden BNP weren't just on the right, they were all right.
(Man) We saw the Harvester beat the living crap out of Swastikom in the semis.
But Jew Hater has his eyes on that record set by Panzer Daddy.
(Armando) Tinkman realised the BNP had to move away from its bovver boy image, which it did by launching its new campaign slogan "We're not bovvered".
The comedian Catherine Tate objected to the use of her "I'm not bovvered" catch phrase, but soon her house was firebombed.
I actually thought it was very harsh, you know, when they burned Catherine Tate's house down.
- Yeah.
- At least she was born here.
Her house was... was burnt down when she said she didn't support our policies.
But nothing was ever proved.
But a lot of people's houses burnt down who don't like the BNP.
It's... it's just one of those things.
What can I say, you know?
I think fire must like our policies.
(laughs)
I loved Dragons' Den.
Novelty T-shirts.
Yes, one's first reaction would be that the market's dead, but, er... da-da.
So your market is a 60-year-old emphysema sufferer.
That's your market.
So it would seem, so it would seem.
But, er... observe the humorous twist.
Da-da!
That's a bit of humour I think everyone can get.
- Any questions?
- Why do you ask?
Just in case you had any questions.
Do you know the breathing muscle can be trained during Pilates classes?
Yes.
I did, yeah.
Any... any other questions?
I hated Dragons' Den.
The Apprentice. "You're fired!"
That just got everyone just going, "You're fired!"
Um... just great writing on that show.
Good incidental music.
Sorry, I just...
I suddenly...
I suddenly just got really depressed.
He shouldn't be, because there were things like Daniel Corbett's Tinkerbell Weather.
Could also be a misty start, particularly as we come to the south and the west, like we saw this morning.
Eight for Plymouth...
People used to get disappointed when they met him and his sleeves didn't sparkle.
He'd get punched quite a lot over that.
...through the day, just fizzling out, the main energy goes well east, so it just... disappears.
Singapore 2005, and London waits to hear if it's got the 2012 Olympics.
(Paper tearing)
(Paper rustling and tearing)
I remember thinking, "It's taking an age, an age."
- (Paper tearing) - (low chatter)
(Paper rustling)
- London.
- (Cheering)
Nobody was... was interested in the Olympics by 2012 anyway.
Black people kept winning all the races, and that's another thing, the Olympics totally exposed the hypocrisy of racism, because how can white people be racist if they're not even winning the races?
It's not rocket engineering, is it?
However, as the 2012 Olympics drew nearer, the enthusiasm built up.
Preparations were made for a fabulous opening ceremony,
Including a plan to blow up 150,000 knackered fridges.
There were spectacular plans for that opening ceremony.
Ten thousand children doing the Ricky Gervais dance.
(Children) # Na-na na-na na-na, na-na na-na na-na: : :
But, alas, despite all the careful preparation, time, money, rehearsal and choreography that had gone into this opening ceremony,
It never saw the light of day.
2012, and the night of the opening ceremony.
The stadium for some reason is empty, and soon Sebastian Coe is approached by a Channel 4 presenter, Justin Lee Collins.
Justin Lee Collins, an Important entertainer of the time, tells Coe the whole thing has been a hoax.
The Olympics went to Paris after all.
The whole London thing was a big wind-up by The Friday Night Project.
I don't know how he thought we were gonna react.
Did he think the whole nation was gonna go, "Good one, you got us" and not want blood?
- I can take a joke as much as the next man.
- Yeah, yeah.
But then I like the Olympics probably more than any man on earth.
But when Justin Lee Collins made a lie and a joke out of it... (Snorts)... something inside me snapped and I said, " I'm going to kill you,
"you stupid, ignorant, hairy little shit."
Have you ever been wound up or pranked?
No, I've not ever been wound up or pranked, no.
The only thing that's ever happened to me that has made me feel ill at ease in any way is coming here today and finding out that I'd signed something saying that I would have all my hair shaved off.
And if that's your idea of a prank, if getting people to sign a contract in which the small print says that they would have their hair shaved off is your idea of a prank, then you have to look at what Justin Lee Collins did, right?
Justin Lee Collins fictionalised
- the location of the Olympics...
- Yes.
...which makes this, you getting me to shave my hair off, look a bit of a waste of time.
And yet you are supposed to be
- a programme-maker at the cutting edge.
- Mm-hm.
You need to take a long, hard look at yourself.
- (Chuckles)
- One time with hair,
- and a second time without.
- I'm happy to take a long, hard look at myself.
- You should take a long, hard look at yourself.
- I'm implying you wouldn't.
In the condition you're in.
This night, however, no one liked being pranked and Collins was chased by a very angry crowd.
There were thousands of emails from people.
And there were some from Cabinet ministers and the clergy.
All saying the same thing.
"Let's kill the son of a bitch."
Over a million members of the public and athletes chased Collins across London.
Finally, in a barren wasteland in Shoreditch, a savage crowd, including Jamie Oliver and Natasha Kaplinsky, found Justin Lee Collins wounded and exhausted.
- I think you tried to grill him, didn't you?
- Yeah.
Fatty.
- Yeah.
- Not a lot there.
Sebastian Coe insisted he be the one to finish him off with a shovel.
I just went up to a policeman and I said, " I'm Sebastian Coe
"and I've just killed Justin Lee Collins."
And he said, "Sorry, I can't hear what you're saying.
"I didn't see a thing.
Move on, please."
Well, after about ten policemen, I finally found one that... that agreed to arrest me.
Pleaded guilty.
I've been here ever since.
(Coe taps chair and sighs)
But I...
I understand that when I do get out,
I won't have to buy another drink or pay for a taxi again.
I visit Seb, er... usually about once a month.
You'd think an ex-Tory MP called Sebastian would be a... a real shower-room frig puppet in prison, but no.
They all call him Mr Coe and he gets anything he wants.
Vernon Kay kept growing.
He was really tall, and it got to the stage where they were having to scale up his dressing room to make him feel less bad and less self-conscious.
But, I mean, if you're doing a game show and you're looking at a quarter of a million bill just to get him through the door, it's very hard to keep him in work.
(Man) He's always been a tall man.
So for a long time people were able to say, "No, he looks enormous but that's just..."
Big personality as well, and he's an energetic man.
And then people started getting incontrovertible evidence, um...
like he stepped on a couple of people.
- He got very cranky and bad-tempered...
- Mm.
...as a result of the stretching, and his skin became very thin, um...
like tracing paper.
I suppose what everyone remembers is when he blotted out the sun.
And, again, those famous photos of, um... the dark... sort of this bleak, almost post-nuclear landscape.
- The Vernon winter.
- The Vernon winter, with this gigantic...
Yeah, all the papers were trying to do puns about the vernal equinox or... but no one could quite nail it, because everyone was too frightened to think of puns.
While I regret the fact that he had to be destroyed, um...
I wish it just could have been done more humanely.
He was not a bad man.
He was just tall.
The 2012 General Election, and David Cameron is elected Prime Minister.
But the biggest upset was that the BNP came second.
All of a sudden, racism was the new black.
The BNP were using very sophisticated marketing strategies at this time to make themselves more acceptable, like that competition where they had the "Complete the phrase, 'I 'm not racist but... '
"in ten words or less."
Now, I don't think all the people who entered that competition prove that Britain is becoming more racist.
I think it was just a really good prize.
It was a week in a castle.
Cameron, young and naive, was actually one of the most terrible Prime Ministers we've ever had and lasted only 20 days.
He legislated for all drink to be accessed via a solicitor.
Just a pint of London Pride, a dry white wine, and a packet of pistachios, please.
I'll get onto that right away.
We should have that ready for you in two to three minutes.
He said it would be a good Idea to have surgeons wear photo masks of themselves so that patients would find being operated on more reassuring.
Just pass me my...
And he thought it would help race relations
If the BBC put on a show called The Black And Asian Minstrel Show.
Even though the show was conceived, like Love Thy Neighbour, for example, with the best will in the world,
I think ultimately it did more harm than good and certainly the riots that followed the first broadcast and the thousands of deaths in multiracial communities across urban Britain would seem to bear that out.
- Were you affected by it?
- No.
I didn't personally find it offensive because I don't have any black or Asian friends.
(Armando) Some of the programme-makers did go to prison.
Some of them went to prison, some of them were killed, and some did the decent thing and took their own lives.
In power, Cameron's behaviour grew increasingly erratic.
He poured party money Into a Tory television channel.
We're also going to take off quite a lot of the hair.
We're going to squint the eye, we're going to employ a chin brace which will give that receding jaw look.
The eyeballs will have to be inverted before reseating in the sockets.
He lashed out against his opponents on live television.
It's those cu... (Bleep)... ts that I'm determined we should stop and I'll be joining campaigning groups like the one here today up and down the country to draw attention to these cu... (Bleep)... ts.
One of his aides came up to me and said, um...
"If I go to the police, he will kill my family."
And finally, he committed the dreadful, hideous act that he's now very famous for.
The shocking thing was, it was in a church.
At least, I think that's where it started.
He must have been planning it for months.
It was sort of balletic.
I don't know what was worse, the sight, the sound or the smell.
I just felt sorry for the people in the front row, cos they got a face full of it.
Things were calming down between the Muslims and the West, and he does that.
Menzies Campbell tried to stop him, but it looked like he was joining in.
You know, even to this day, nothing will grow on that ground.
Cameron was forced to call another election.
His manifesto was a blank page with the words "Time to dream" written at the top.
His first party political broadcast left everyone baffled.
...about what people's experiences have been.
(Roberta Flack) # The first time
# Ever I saw your face
# I thought the sun
# Rose in your eyes...
Now, would you mind just trying on those specs for me?
- What do you think?
- Good.
Very good.
So, a good start.
Let's see.
Willet or won't it?
Cameron was doing badly.
The Tories were trailing the BNP.
Everything now hung on his eve-of-poll rally.
(# Disco music plays)
Things
Can only get better
Better
Now that I've found you
Things
Can only get better
Better
Now that I've found you
(Music stops)
Cameron was sacked on the spot.
- People still remember you as...
- Oh, yes.
...one of the... one of the shortest-lived Prime Ministers of all time.
Yes, well, um... 20 days is a long time in politics.
It's the equivalent of 480 hours, which sounds a lot longer than it actually is.
The next day the BNP was the largest party In a hung parliament.
BNP leader Diana Tinkman now had to choose between Conservative or Labour for a coalition.
Oh, it was really hard to choose.
I think it's like, er... if you're in a room with Dermot O'Leary, Jamie Theakston, Patrick Kielty, and you've got a shotgun and two cartridges.
(Chuckles) You know, what do you do?
You empty two barrels into Kielty and then have fun with the rifle butt.
(laughs)
We have confirmed movement on the west side of the perimeter.
Roger that, Dwayne.
What's your position?
Airborne in position to the south of the surveillance area.
We have movement from inside the compound.
Everyone stand by.
Code 1.
Code 1.
We have gunfire on the ground from the east.
Repeat, east side.
Chopper 1 and Chopper 2, we have authorization.
Take down all elements within the compound.
Marshall, we have one escapee heading your way on a motorcycle.
Roger that.
I have a visual.
He has turned towards the north.
Air support required immediately.
I have the electronic lock.
Unloading the chain gun.
Suspect is still heading north.
Switching to rockets.
Gonna bring him down for you to clean up, Marshall.
He's down, he's down.
On foot and still heading north.
- He's all yours.
- Roger that.
Retrieving the sequencer was the right thing to do.
However, the Majestic drug research program is none of your concern.
The consequences are the same, no matter how you look at it.
We made the treaties, they broke them.
Now you expect me to clean up after them?
- That's not gonna happen, you hear?
- Marshall, I repeat, let it go.
We've received new orders, sir.
0800 hours to Paris.
A training mission.
Oh, well, let's go pack our gear.
Do we stand down, sir?
- That's right.
- Sir.
Well, anyway...
I mean, I'm...
Your room keys, sir.
They come from a really good SF team and Admiral Morgan recommended them as replacements.
They have two days' field training before our next assignment.
They'll be all right.
Okay, children, let's go.
So Marshall Lawson.
What do you guys know about him?
I mean, the man walks with an air of confidence that's rarely seen in this day and age.
What?
What?
I'm serious.
He does.
Yeah, him and his girlfriend, Dwayne.
There's just two things you need to know about Lawson.
One is he's a bad motherfucker and two, he's a bad motherfucker.
- I hear that.
- That's the truth.
Here's to what might could be a real good team.
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- And if not, you can always kill us, sir.
I'm thinking about that already.
You're all about to cut your teeth now, let me tell you something.
Grab a beer at the bar.
Just take it easy.
- Sir.
- Oh, take it easy?
Okay.
Those fucking guys have no idea what we're up against.
Yeah, well, I've got a bad, bad feeling they about to find out.
Requesting permission to leave the premises.
- Can't get no love around here.
- We're thinking of going to a titty bar.
I ain't getting no love and I'm too old for love.
And I'm too poor.
- Why don't you go on.
- We'll catch you later.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
Just remember.
Tomorrow, 0700.
Be here.
- Oh, yeah.
On the dot.
- Right.
This place is cold.
It could freeze the balls off a penguin.
- Where the hell are we going now?
- All right.
Guys?
- Yeah.
- Oh, there, there.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
This is the best day of my life.
Yeah!
Oh, man.
All right, I love you.
- Oh, dude.
- Oh, my...
She's the one.
She's the one.
She's the one.
- Hey.
- Hello.
Any chance?
Party, later.
- We've got a party back at our hotel.
- At the hotel.
You want me to go, you have to talk to him.
- What, talk to him?
- Yeah.
See you in a minute.
Can I talk to you for a minute, man?
What's your pleasure?
That girl.
Treat her right.
Okay.
And I'll send someone around to collect.
Deal.
Okay.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
- We got a deal.
- Thank you.
- Cheers.
- Carl.
Let's go.
Thanks, man.
- There you go, man.
- Thanks, man.
Thank you very much.
You've been so very kind tonight.
Thank you.
We've got love.
You be all right by yourself?
All right.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm following new orders.
Just like you.
Okay.
Come on, guys, open the door.
Jesus, guys.
Come on.
Jerk off all over the wallpaper all night.
I'm up.
I'm up next.
Least I can get it up next.
At least I can get it up in the first place.
Honey, you're with the wrong guy.
I might not know what I'm doing, but I can do it all night.
Come on, guys, open the door.
Phil.
- All right, I'll see you in the morning.
- See you later.
Hey.
Well, let's have a look.
- Check it out.
- What the fuck?
No.
Don't bother.
They're all dead.
Come with me.
Oh, Jesus.
Detective Lambert, et vous?
Yeah, I'm Commander Lawson and this is Chief Dixon.
And we're all active military.
These are my guys.
I'm gonna have to claim the bodies and take them in for a special autopsy.
The bodies are mine.
They are under my jurisdiction.
Okay.
Listen to me, young man.
I'm gonna have somebody in your government call you immediately and explain who has jurisdiction over these guys.
Do you hear me?
Just keep an eye on your watch.
Within about 20 minutes, you're gonna be told who gets the bodies.
Dwayne, find that titty bar.
Thanks.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- What's your name?
- Reina.
Maybe you can help me with something, Reina.
Some buddies of mine were here tonight.
You see who they were hanging with?
Can't have you upsetting the girls.
Just making small talk.
Why don't you make it somewhere else?
Look, I was just asking her a few questions.
I'm looking for some buddies that were here tonight.
I'm sorry about your trouble, but the police will take care of it.
Yeah, well, the police ain't working fast enough.
I guess the police will handle it, then.
- What do you got?
- Just like you figured.
Massive physical trauma, but also traces of a new drug, CTX.
Apparently, it's the new party drug.
We've had several overdose victims recently.
What now?
I don't know, man.
I just needed some time to think.
You okay?
My team, they're well-trained.
Real well-trained.
Whoever did this, or whatever did this, they're good.
It was brutal.
Yeah, well, that might be but it was an assassination, that's for sure.
Revenge for some past operation?
Could be.
I thought of that.
It could be.
Revenge is a two-way street.
I had local police arrest the club owner.
You wanna check him out?
No, I'm going to Majestic headquarters.
Access denied.
ID, please.
This is a restricted area.
I'm sorry, commander, but this area is now closed even to someone with your classification.
That's very strange that they would have pulled my clearance and not told me about it.
Commander, I need you to step aside.
I'm sorry, commander, I need you to vacate the facility.
Yeah?
Did Robinson tell you why they revoked your clearance?
No, not really.
Okay.
When and where?
Café, east side of the building.
Twenty minutes.
I'll see you there.
Didn't I tell you to stay out of sight, Aroon?
And didn't I pay you to stop people from looking for me, Lambert?
I can't help it if the U.S. military is taking an interest in your activities.
How was I supposed to know that Uncle Sam would send in some of his finest?
Those boys were having fun.
Yeah?
You know, the irony is that Marshall and his team weren't even looking for you.
Those boys were looking for some R and R.
And they found it.
Your girl Reina, she had a little too much fun.
She might have got a little out of control, I suppose.
Well, then, it's a little out of my jurisdiction.
Can you get me out of here?
Lambert, this is still a U.S. military investigation.
Just trying to help.
Get the fuck out of here before I have your French ass kicked out.
I just heard about your team.
I'm so sorry, Marshall.
If there's anything I can do...
I really need to know who did this.
Very impressive record.
I like to think so.
Head of the biochemical research program in Western Europe.
Top-secret research.
You're a top dog, Aroon.
Be all you can be.
Why not?
Your partner didn't mind.
Yes, well, Tia's a very special girl.
Besides, they'll need her for the cover-up.
Although, if she's not careful, they'll probably make her the fall guy.
We've been monitoring this area for more than six months because a top-level Majestic researcher went AWOL.
Let me ask you something.
What's the story with Majestic and drug movement?
They control the CTX research program but Werner wants everybody and everything to stand down until we know what's going on.
Yeah?
Hello, Robinson.
Listen to me, you arrogant little prick.
I don't understand any of this fancy research you're fucking with.
But what I do understand is this:
Three of my boys got murdered and I want to know why.
Wrong place, wrong time?
Your girl Reina was a little careless.
We found this in the hotel room and this in your club.
The autopsy confirmed significant traces of this chemical in the three dead bodies.
Your boys must have liked it, then.
Listen, asshole.
I want to know what's going on in your club.
And what's happening to the people around here.
Are you making me an offer?
Sure.
Either you tell me or I shoot you so full of this shit that it'll make you talk or it'll kill you.
I'll handle it.
Yup.
I need access to an armory.
- I'll see what I can do.
- You know the weapons I like.
I gotta deal with Robinson first.
You've no idea who you're dealing with.
So fucking enlighten me, because right now you are dealing with me.
Dwayne, meet CTX.
CTX, meet Dwayne.
So how does it work, this CTX?
Could you give me five?
I have orders to shut you down.
All military drug-testing programs have been canceled.
- lf I were to ask you why?
- You don't even need to ask.
Aroon's defection has caused a serious breach in our CTX program.
So we're talking about chemical warfare.
Chemically-induced warfare.
So who do you work for?
Someone who doesn't like a lot of questions.
She does have access to seemingly unlimited Russian financing, though.
And that's one of the reasons I don't like asking a lot of questions.
Why here?
When you experiment, you need to test.
When I was in the Army, I had access to as many guinea pigs as I wanted.
Soldiers.
For research.
You have no idea how many soldiers gave up their lives for science.
It was funded by the military.
Once I went AWOL, I still had to perfect the formula and that meant testing it.
On who?
John Smith.
Jane Doe.
Innocent people as your guinea pigs?
It's amazing what types of corruption you can buy these days.
We cannot get caught in the spotlight.
But what we can do is limit the damage.
And in a couple of months, it'll all blow away.
Okay.
No questions asked.
- Not by the wrong people.
- Like Marshall.
That's why you're gonna work with him.
All you have to do is to make sure he does not unnecessarily compromise our agenda.
Now, you seriously think I can help you in this?
If you work with me on this one, I'll make it worth your while.
Look, I know that you and Marshall are close.
But he can't give you the career you want.
Not the opportunities a young, gifted, vibrant biochemist really deserves.
- So this is what it's like, huh?
- What's that?
Making a deal with the devil himself.
- Have you had contact with him?
- Aroon?
No.
I worked with him.
I taught him everything he knows.
Except how to resist temptation.
I decided to introduce CTX to the club scene.
New party drug.
Has an exquisite high.
Very pleasurable.
Instantly addictive, but very...
- Lucrative?
- Yes.
But when one doesn't have CTX for a while one becomes a bit of a lethargic mess.
Traces of CTX lodge themselves in your system and become dormant.
They gradually change your DNA.
And under the right circumstances, they can be triggered.
Especially in situations involving conflict or aggression.
And that's what I think happened to your boys.
They probably got a bit carried away with Reina.
She mistook their libido for aggression and, well...
Spare me the psychology.
When your body is suddenly flooded with adrenalin from the CTX you become a bit like a wild animal, fighting for survival.
You become a killing machine.
You have no morals.
You have no humanity.
And that's what the government was, and is, interested in.
A drug that makes soldiers mindless killers right up until the point that they die.
- And Tia knows this?
- Of course.
CTX was our baby.
We developed it together.
Robinson and Werner kept the whole operation very hush-hush.
It was to be their big step up through the ranks.
We want to talk to your boss.
I don't think she'll be interested in that conversation.
We'll see about that.
Where is she hiding?
Where is she?
I'm doing you a favor.
If you were all to arrive there, she'd kill you instantly.
You think the U.S. Army is just gonna walk away from this?
Even if they did, I would hunt you down and kill you myself.
Well, it's already too late.
A large quantity of CTX is going to be released into the city's water supply.
Everyone within a 100-mile radius is either going to be addicted or dead.
You got it all wrong, Aroon.
Oh, you're going to regret that, soldier boy.
I don't think so, guinea pig.
Revenge is a two-way street.
Watch him.
I'm going to get a medic.
Need a light?
- We're being followed.
- Who are they?
I don't know.
I'm about to find out.
I think they might be Robinson's boys.
Can I help you?
- Why's that?
- Well, because you're following us.
I'm not following you.
You know what, man?
I bet you if I reach in your pocket...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- What is this?
Well, see now, Naval Intelligence.
I'm disappointed.
You lied to me.
Tell me something.
Should we be cooperating with Robinson and Majestic?
None of that stuff works.
So you're telling me Tia is our only option?
That's right, baby.
That's right.
Tell me what you know.
It's Majestic.
They're putting together another strike team.
We've got to try and persuade Tia to join us.
Sir, this will turn ugly.
I think the ship already sailed on that.
It's still containable.
We need to contact our people, bring them in for their own protection.
Now, you know the liaison.
Now, you worked with her.
She wouldn't endanger the program, right?
You trained them.
They've worked together before.
They're close.
I can't guarantee you anything.
Just a friendly visit.
- Your idea, or hers?
- Does it matter?
She might cut out your allowance.
Just like Robinson and Werner cut out yours?
- Only for a little while.
- I'm sure.
First, they need you in the trenches, with Marshall and his grunts.
I wouldn't be there if it wasn't for you.
Oh, come on.
The right deal will come along and you'll be a defector someday.
Not as a fugitive from the law.
Now, I may not have my own dentistry or retirement plan, exactly but I am doing what we love to do, Tia.
Well, enjoy it.
Because it ain't gonna last.
Oh, yes.
Of course.
I forgot.
Marshall.
You remember the excitement when we first sequenced the CTX formula?
You and I, we complement each other, Tia.
Work for me.
Work with me.
So do I take it that's a no?
Yes.
Of course, you realize there will be consequences.
- Were you followed?
- We were followed.
- But we took care of that.
- Good.
If words gets back to Werner that I'm talking to you guys...
I don't think you'll have to worry about Werner.
He might not be happy about our personal thing but he knows who sent me here and he knows why I'm here so he's not gonna say nothing to me.
My entire fucking team's wiped out so you know what would be really helpful right now?
If you stop feeding us this bullshit and give us decent intel that we can use.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Why do you think I'm here?
I'm very sorry about your team.
I'm sorry for your men.
But you know what I think would be very nice?
If you'd realize that I'm on your side.
You know Aroon's escaped.
He knows you're onto him.
And I know he's gonna follow through with his plans.
If that's the case, I'll brief your team on what kind of weapons will work and what won't.
- What will you do about Werner?
- Forget it.
I'll go to the admiral myself.
Believe me when I tell you, he will give us carte blanche for this mission.
They're Lambert's cops.
Let's have some fun.
Hey, guys, they are onto us.
Let's call for backup.
It is unfortunate you could not have persuaded Tia to join us.
She would have been a great asset.
Yes.
I'm sorry to have failed in that regard.
Don't be ridiculous.
Nothing can stop us from reaching our goal.
Tia and Marshall will be relentless now.
They'll do all that they can to hunt us down.
First, they have to find us.
Be assured, Marshall will use all of his resources to do that.
It will be too late.
Right?
- You want me to go ahead with it?
- I'm surprised you haven't already.
It was your idea, after all.
- It's fairly radical.
- Brilliant.
We are forced to react now.
Consider it done.
CTX will enter the city's water supply within an hour.
It'll spread very rapidly.
Most of the population will be addicted come, say, dinnertime.
Where is the other body?
Detective Lambert, phone.
The undercover agents are dead.
- All three of them?
- Yes, sir.
You wanted to see me?
We've had traces of CTX show up in the town's water supply.
Do we know where?
My intel is tracing the readings back to the source of the CTX.
Good, that is worth knowing.
How much time we got?
Current measurements predict 15,000 people will be fully addicted to CTX in the next 12 hours.
I'm afraid Werner and Robinson will let this happen and make us the scapegoats.
Marshall's not gonna let that happen.
He's got a new team together.
Tell Marshall I'm having his armory brought here.
Thanks for the decent intel.
You're welcome, soldier.
What are we doing here?
It's my place.
I have two agents here to brief us.
- Admiral, you wanted to see me?
- Yeah.
- Do I need to be worried?
- Not in the least.
- Everything's under control.
- Everything?
Are you keeping me informed of everything?
Admiral, I can handle it.
Handle it?
At the end of the day, none of this will ever have happened.
Okay?
I never liked the CTX program, or Werner and Robinson.
- Who handles the case locally?
- Detective Lambert, I believe.
I want to talk to him.
We're gonna have to start kicking over some trash cans.
Our low-orbiting recon has determined the parameters of their activities.
It includes the outskirts of the city, as well as...
Marshall, don't shoot.
We need her alive.
Nice timing, Dwayne.
Dwayne, get me the injured out of here, ASAP.
Get me a cleanup team in here, ASAP.
Got the Wicked Witch of the North here.
Try to secure her.
Get her into the Majestic lab and in interrogation, ASAP.
Dwayne, give me a hand, would you?
So, what's the intel?
We have confirmed reports of primary victims those most vulnerable to the infection.
Sadly, more of these will just pinpoint Aroon's base and the CTX lab.
- How are we gonna deal with them?
- The way we always do.
Let's go to the armory.
Marshall, I have these just for you.
These Nanographite blades were built for a man with your kind of fighting skills.
They are of the strongest substance known and will extend to fight as fast as the reflexes of the person using them.
Now, they're assimilated to your body.
They should balance the reflexes of someone addicted to CTX.
They'll come in handy.
I think this is a lot bigger than any one of us could have ever imagined.
I still got a few tricks up my sleeve.
I'm glad somebody does.
I'm gonna check it out.
What the fuck were they thinking?
It's just really a shame it turned out this way.
- What's the story with Tia?
- Tia's good.
That's my girl.
I trained her.
She has a lot of special abilities.
She has a lot of special technique.
She'll work out good for us.
We're fucked, aren't we?
I don't think so.
You think we have a chance?
I do.
Are you losing control of the situation?
They're in a secure area.
Nothing should endanger the program.
We are all in danger until they are dead.
Unless we can bring them to us, on our terms.
You got a plan?
Well, see, we're kind of between a rock and a hard place.
We had to come in here to get stuff we needed but as soon as we accessed the building, Werner knew.
So we got trouble.
I'm starting to think we should call for backup.
Unfortunately, it's not going to be backup that comes.
It's going to be a strike team to take us out.
Oh, shit.
Okay, guys.
Get your teams up and out.
I've got something to do here.
Let's go.
So, what have we got?
The old transit holding center has gone online, sir.
Which means they've occupied the building.
Send in a strike team.
Soft entry.
- Morgan's onto us.
- But he's not the problem.
We're talking mass hysteria if this gets out.
Let's make goddamned sure it doesn't.
Well, Reina.
Here are your choices: talk or die.
I hope you do the right thing because enough people have died already.
Where is Aroon's base?
Reina, do you hear me?
I'm running out of patience.
I will never tell you anything.
This time you really pissed me off.
You killed all of my best men.
That wasn't nice.
Now, you know what this will do to you.
Now, I'm going to give you about three seconds.
In three seconds, if you don't tell me I will kill you.
Just like you did to my men.
One.
Two.
Three.
Bastia!
Not so tough after all.
- She did the right thing.
- He's a very good listener.
Clear.
- Clear.
- Clear.
Clear.
- Clear.
- Sir?
They're gone.
Let's get out of here.
Damn it!
The lab has been completely wiped, sir.
We have a shitload of weapons missing and technology unaccounted for.
Who code-accessed the building?
The liaison, Tia.
And Marshall Lawson.
- You know him, right?
- Oh, yeah.
He's a headcase.
Does what he wants.
We had to transfer him out.
Where are they now?
We are using a tracking device as we speak.
Wait right there, sir.
This area is restricted.
Can I help you?
Detective Lambert.
Local police.
And?
These are undercover policemen.
My guys.
The autopsy showed up a big amount of a substance and the rumor is that it was developed by the military.
And you have evidence to support this?
Is three dead bodies not enough?
No.
I don't think I can help you.
You're wasting my time.
This is not military business.
Take it up with my superiors.
You bet I will.
Are you sure this is secure?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
I set it up.
- You don't think we should call it in?
- Let's get there first.
Well, we will call in when the time is right.
So, what are we going to do?
We're going to send in our best A-team.
I've gone to a lot of trouble to teach my number one finest who's infected with CTX and who's not.
You know that.
Once they know we've made them they will be killing us real quick.
It's either them or us.
First come, first served.
It's off the A88.
Just east.
Can I talk to you?
Yeah.
Talk away.
In private?
Sure.
Clean the slate.
Find the bitch and take her out.
Robinson, yeah.
Go ahead.
We got them.
Safe house on the edge of town.
Make sure you get it right this time.
I pray we're making the right decision.
Can I trust you?
I certainly hope so.
You know I care for you.
I know.
Me too.
Identification, please.
Hey.
I'll cover the back on my own.
Your team, cover the front.
- Clear.
- Clear.
You sent in a team without my authorization?
I had to make a split decision.
I think it was the right one.
You seriously underestimated Marshall and his abilities.
We've got a secure call coming in for you, admiral.
Who is it?
Won't say.
But he's on one of our secure walkies.
- Patch him into the speakerphone.
- Done.
You're on with him now.
- Admiral?
- What can I do for you, Marshall?
I'm flattered, really flattered, you recognize my voice.
You're the only one to pull a stunt like this.
I'm assuming the strike team is dead.
Yeah, that's a good assumption.
Tell Werner he needs to get up earlier than that.
Aroon's base has been located in a small village somewhere outside of Bordeaux called...
Bastia.
Bastia.
I can handle this.
Marshall tell me when and where.
All right.
I'll send you an encryption with the gory details but suffice it to say that I'd like my favorite A-team to shoot in here right quick.
And we're going to do this the old-fashioned way.
It looks like we'll be working together after all.
I'll provide the intel and the training, you give me the men.
Order B-company to mobilize.
Let's move out.
If we maintain the element of surprise while the sections enter and search the village then I will lead the attack force and push forward towards Aroon's base.
Any specifics that the Army should know about?
Watch for the rapid pulsation in the eyes.
If you see that, you have no time.
Because of the CTX, they are pumped full of adrenaline giving them almost superhuman strength and reflexes.
I say, again, they are animals out to kill you and your men.
What about containment, Marshall?
We believe that the perimeter's secure and we will be able to stop any breaches.
Oh, I'm pleased to hear that, Marshall.
But if this fucks up, if the world goes down you're going to have to go down with it.
Well, in that case, maybe we could take Werner with us.
He can report back to you everything we're doing.
How's that?
Good idea.
Well, I'm...
I'm not dressed.
That's okay.
We'll put camos on you and give you a machine gun and let you come with us.
Detective Lambert for Admiral Morgan.
Sir, you've got a call for you.
You said to call you with information.
I am here at the cathedral.
This is where you need to send your troops.
You know it's out of my jurisdiction.
It's okay, we're on it.
Okay, salut.
Troops are on the outskirts of Bastia, admiral.
Section one in position.
Section two in position.
Section three in position.
Marshall?
This is Marshall.
Go ahead, admiral.
Our intel tracking tells us they have gone to ground in an old church.
I have those coordinates, sir.
And, Marshall my troops are still deployed in the village.
I can't send you any backup.
From here, you and your guys are on your own.
Good luck.
Copy that, sir.
Let's check out the guardhouse.
Okay, don't move.
Just a few questions for you.
Leave us alone.
Who is at the cathedral?
I don't know.
Watch their eyes for CTX symptoms.
Quiet, don't move.
Check the eyes for changes in dilation.
- Tell me or I'll kill you.
- Go fuck yourself.
They're on CTX.
I can see it.
Don't move.
Let's head to the cathedral.
The eyes, check the eyes.
Check their eyes.
Clear.
Get up.
This one's okay.
Let's go, men.
He's okay.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
Gotta be something to make you hang back.
Right, let's just keep up with Marshall.
He'll be fine.
We need to rely on our instincts to get out of here alive.
- So, what is it, soldier?
- Aroon's lab.
Gotta be somewhere around here.
- Let's take a look.
- Okay.
- CTX?
- Yeah.
It's still unrefined.
It needs to dry out to get its powder form.
How much is all this worth?
Enough to get scared.
Real scared.
Shit.
He fucking did it.
It's the city's water supply system.
- And?
- He's contaminated it.
Effective enough for a hundred-mile radius.
Bastard!
We're splitting into fours.
A-team goes left B- team goes to the right, let's go.
I told you there'd be consequences.
Dwayne, lead the B-team.
Yes, sir.
Let's go.
Nobu, let's move.
Sir?
Fuck.
Let's go.
I lost everybody, sir.
They're all dead.
So now you've come to kill me, Marshall.
But as you know, revenge is a two-way street.
Maybe you'd consider joining forces?
I see, of course not.
You're a military man, a man of honor and integrity.
That's too bad.
In that case, you will all die.
I promise you.
Nobu and I will take this bitch.
Dwayne, watch the back door.
Confirmamos,temos movimento na parte este do perimetro.
Recebio, Dwayne.
Qual é a tua posiçao?
Airborne in position to the south of the surveillance area.
Temos movimento vindo de dentro do campo .
Esperam todos.
Codigo 1. codigo 1.
Temos disparos de dentro,da parte oeste.
Repito, east side.
Chopper 1 and Chopper 2, temos autorizaçao.
Mata todos os lementos que estao no campo.
Marshall, we have one escapee heading your way on a motorcycle.
Recebido.
I have a visual.
He has turned towards the north.
Precisa-se suporte aereo imediato.
I have the electronic lock.
Unloading the chain gun.
Os suspeitos continuam escondidos a norte.
Mudando para rockets.
Gonna bring him down for you to clean up, Marshall.
He's down, he's down.
On foot and still heading north.
Ele é todo teu
- Recebido.
Retrieving the sequencer was the right thing to do.
However, the Majestic drug research program is none of your concern.
As consequencias sao as mesmas, nao importa como ves isso.
Nos fizemos as regras, eles quebrarem isso.
Now you expect me to clean up after them?
-Isso nao vai acontecer,ouviste?
- Marshall, eu repito, deixa-o ir.
Recebemos novas ordens, sir.
0800 hours to Paris.
Uma missao de teino.
Oh, well, let's go pack our gear.
Do we stand down, sir?
- Esta certo.
- Sir.
Well, anyway...
I mean, I'm...
As chaves do teu quarto, sir.
They come from a really good SF team and Admiral Morgan recommended them as replacements.
They have two days' field training before our next assignment.
Eles ficaram bem.
Esta bem,crianças,vamos.
So Marshall Lawson.
O que é que voces rapazes sabem sobre ele?
I mean, the man walks with an air of confidence that's rarely seen in this day and age.
O que?
O que?
Falo a serio.Ele faz.
Sim, ele e a namorada, Dwayne.
So a duas coisas que deves saber sobre o Lawson.
One is he's a bad motherfucker and two, he's a bad motherfucker.
- Eu ouvi isso.
-Essa é a verdade.
Here's to what might could be a real good team.
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- And if not, you can always kill us, sir.
I'm thinking about that already.
You're all about to cut your teeth now, let me tell you something.
Grab a beer at the bar.
Just take it easy.
- Sir.
- Oh, take it easy?
Esta bem.
Those fucking guys have no idea what we're up against.
Sim, bem, eu tenho um mau, mau presentimento que estao prestes a descobrir.
Requesting permission to leave the premises.
- Can't get no love around here.
- We're thinking of going to a titty bar.
I ain't getting no love and I'm too old for love.
And I'm too poor.
- Porque é que nao vais embora.
- Vmos te buscar mais tarde.
Esta bem.Obrigado, sir.
Lembra-te.
Amanha, 07:00.
Esta aqui.
- Oh, yeah.
On the dot.
- Right.
Este lugar é quente.
It could freeze the balls off a penguin.
- Para onde vamos agora?
- Esta bem.
Rapazes?
-Sim.
- Oh, ali, ali.
Manha. manha.
Manha.
Este é o melhor dia da minha vida.
Sim!
Oh, homem.
Esta bem,eu amo-te.
- Oh, dude.
- Oh, my...
She's the one.
She's the one.
She's the one.
- Hey.
- Hello.
Any chance?
Party, later.
- We've got a party back at our hotel.
- At the hotel.
Se queres que eu va, tens que lhe dizer.
- O que, falar com ele?
- Sim.
See you in a minute.
Posso falar contigo num instante, man?
What's your pleasure?
Aquela rapariga.
Treat her right.
Esta bem.
And I'll send someone around to collect.
Deal.
Esta bem.Obrigado. Adeus.
- We got a deal.
- Thank you.
- Cervejas
- Carl.
Vamos.
Obrigado, man.
- There you go, man.
- Thanks, man.
Muito obrigado.
Foste tao gentil esta noite.
Obrigado.
Temos amor.
You be all right by yourself?
All right.
- O que é que estas aqui a fazer?
- Estou a cumprir ordens.
Como tu.
Esta bem.
Va la, rapazes, abrem a porta.
Jesus, rapazes.
Vamos embora.
Jerk off all over the wallpaper all night.
I'm up.
I'm up next.
Least I can get it up next.
At least I can get it up in the first place.
Querida, estas com o homem errado.
Posso nao saber o que fazer, mas posso fazer isto a noite toda.
Va la, rapazes, abrem a porta.
Phil.
-Esta bem, vejo-te amanha
- Ate logo.
Hey.
Well, let's have a look.
- Check it out.
- What the fuck?
No.
Don't bother.
Estao todos mortos.
Vem comigo.
Oh, Jesus.
Detective Lambert, et vous?
Sim,eu sou o comandante Lawson e este é o chefef Dixon.
And we're all active military.
Estes sao os meus homens.
I'm gonna have to claim the bodies and take them in for a special autopsy.
Os corpos sao meus.
Estao sobre a minha jurisdiçao
Esta bem.
Ouve-me, homem novo.
I'm gonna have somebody in your government call you immediately e explicar quem tem jurisdiçao sobre estes homens.
Estas-me a ouvir?
Just keep an eye on your watch.
Daqui a vinte minutos, vao te dizer quem fica com os corpos.
Dwayne, find that titty bar.
Obrigado.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Como te chamas?
- Reina.
Talvez possa me ajudar numa coisa, Reina.
Some buddies of mine were here tonight.
You see who they were hanging with?
Can't have you upsetting the girls.
Just making small talk.
Why don't you make it somewhere else?
Olha,so lhe estava a fazer umas perguntas.
Estou a procura de umas pessoas que estiveram aqui esta noite.
Lamento sobre o teu problema, mas a policia tomara conta disto.
Yeah, well, the police ain't working fast enough.
I guess the police will handle it, then.
- What do you got?
- Just like you figured.
Massive physical trauma, but also traces of a new drug, CTX.
Apparently, it's the new party drug.
Recentemente temos tido vitimas de overdose.
O qu é agora?
Eu nao sei, man.
Preciso de um tempo para pensar.
Estas bem?
A minha equipa, eles estao bem treinados.
Mesmo bem treinados.
Quem fez isto, oou o que fez isto, teles sao bons.
É brutal.
Sim, bem, isso quer dizer mas isto foi um assasinato, de certeza.
Revenge for some past operation?
Pode ser.
I thought of that.
Pode ser.
Revenge is a two-way street.
I had local police arrest the club owner.
You wanna check him out?
No, I'm going to Majestic headquarters.
Acesso negado.
Identificaçao,por favor.
Isto e uma area restricta.
Lamento, comandante, mas esta zona esta fechada agora ate para alguem como tu.
That's very strange that they would have pulled my clearance e nao me disseram nada sobre isso.
Comandante,preciso que se afaste.
I'm sorry, commander, I need you to vacate the facility.
Yeah?
Did Robinson tell you why they revoked your clearance?
No, not really.
Esta bem.
Quando e onde?
Café, east side of the building.
Twenty minutes.
Vejo-te la.
Didn't I tell you to stay out of sight, Aroon?
And didn't I pay you to stop people from looking for me, Lambert?
I can't help it if the U.S. military is taking an interest in your activities.
How was I supposed to know that Uncle Sam would send in some of his finest?
Those boys were having fun.
Yeah?
You know, the irony is that Marshall and his team weren't even looking for you.
Those boys were looking for some R and R.
E eles encontraram isto.
Your girl Reina, she had a little too much fun.
She might have got a little out of control, I suppose.
Bem, depois, esta um pouco fora da minha jurisdiçao.
Consegues tirar-me daqui para fora?
Lambert, isto continua a ser uma investigaçao da U.S. military.
So tou tentando ajudar.
Get the fuck out of here before I have your French ass kicked out.
Eu ouvi falar da tua equipa.
Lamento, Marshall.
Se tiver alguma coisa que possa fazer...
Eu preciso mesmo saber quem fez isto.
Very impressive record.
Eu gosto de pensar.
Head of the biochemical research program in Western Europe.
Top-secret research.
You're a top dog, Aroon.
Se tudo o que podes ser.
Porque nao?
Your partner didn't mind.
Sim, bem, Tia's é uma rapariga muito especial.
Besides, they'll need her for the cover-up.
Although, if she's not careful, they'll probably make her the fall guy.
Tivemos a vigiar esta zona mais de seis meses because a top-level Majestic researcher went AWOL.
Deixa-me perguntar te algo.
Qual é a historia sobre Majestic e o movimento de droga?
Eles controlam o programa de reserva da CTX but Werner wants everybody and everything to stand down ate sabermos o que se passa.
Sim?
Ola, Robinson.
Listen to me, you arrogant little prick.
I don't understand any of this fancy research you're fucking with.
But what I do understand is this:
Tres dos meu rapazes morreram e eu quero saber porque.
Lugar errado, altura errada?
Your girl Reina was a little careless.
Encontra-mos isto no quarto do hotel e isto no seu clube.
The autopsy confirmed significant traces of this chemical nos tres corpos.
Your boys must have liked it, then.
Ouve, palerma.
Eu quero saber o que se passa no teu clube.
E o que se passa com as pessoas daqui.
Are you making me an offer?
Claro.
Either you tell me or I shoot you so full of this shit that it'll make you talk or it'll kill you.
I'll handle it.
Yup.
Preciso de acessoa a uma arma.
-Vou ver o que posso fazer.
- Tu sabes as armas que eu gosto.
I gotta deal with Robinson first.
Nao tens ideia com quem estas a negociar.
So fucking enlighten me, because right now you are dealing with me.
Dwayne, conhece CTX.
CTX, conhece Dwayne.
Entao como é que isto funciona, este CTX?
Podes me dar cinco?
I have orders to shut you down.
All military drug-testing programs have been canceled.
- Se eu tiver que te perguntar porque?
-Tu nao precisas responder.
Aroon's defection has caused a serious breach in our CTX program.
So we're talking about chemical warfare.
Chemically-induced warfare.
Entao para quem trabalhas?
Para uma pessoa que nao gosta muito de perguntas.
She does have access to seemingly unlimited Russian financing, though.
E essa é uma das razoes Eu nao gosto de fazer muitas perguntas.
Porque aqui?
Quando experimentas, precisas de testar.
When I was in the Army, I had access to as many guinea pigs as I wanted.
Soldados.
Para a reserva.
You have no idea how many soldiers gave up their lives for science.
Isto foi fundado pelos militares.
Once I went AWOL, I still had to perfect the formula and that meant testing it.
Em quem?
John Smith.
Jane Doe.
Innocent people as your guinea pigs?
É impressionante os tipos de corrupçao que podes vender nestes dias.
We cannot get caught in the spotlight.
But what we can do is limit the damage.
And in a couple of months, it'll all blow away.
Esta bem.
Nenhuam pergunta feita.
- Nao pela pessoa errada.
-Como o Marshall.
É por isso que vais trabalhar com ele.
Tudo o que tens que fazer é te certificar he does not unnecessarily compromise our agenda.
Now, you seriously think Eu posso te ajudar nisto?
If you work with me on this one, I'll make it worth your while.
Olha, eu sei isso tu e o Marshall estao perto.
Mas ele nao te pode dar a carreira que tu queres.
Not the opportunities a young, gifted, vibrant biochemist really deserves.
- Entao isto é o que eu gosto, huh?
- O que é isso?
Fazendo um negocio com o proprio diabo.
- Ja tiveste contacto com ele?
- Aroon?
Nao.
Ja trabalhei com ele.
Eu ensinei-lhe tudo o que ele sabe.
Except how to resist temptation.
I decided to introduce CTX to the club scene.
Uma nova droga.
Has an exquisite high.
Very pleasurable.
Instantly addictive, but very...
- Lucrative?
- Yes.
But when one doesn't have CTX for a while one becomes a bit of a lethargic mess.
Traces of CTX lodge themselves in your system and become dormant.
They gradually change your DNA.
And under the right circumstances, they can be triggered.
Especially in situations involving conflict or aggression.
And that's what I think happened to your boys.
They probably got a bit carried away with Reina.
She mistook their libido for aggression and, well...
Spare me the psychology.
When your body is suddenly flooded with adrenalin from the CTX you become a bit like a wild animal, fighting for survival.
You become a killing machine.
You have no morals.
You have no humanity.
And that's what the government was, and is, interested in.
A drug that makes soldiers mindless killers right up until the point that they die.
-E a Tia sabe disso?
- Claro.
CTX é o seu bebe.
Nos criamos isto juntos.
Robinson and Werner kept the whole operation very hush-hush.
It was to be their big step up through the ranks.
Queremos falar com o teu patrao.
Eu penso que ele nao estara interessado nessa conversa.
Vamos ver isso.
Onde é que ela se esconde?
Onde esta ela?
Eu vou-te fazer um favor.
If you were all to arrive there, she'd kill you instantly.
You think the U.S. Army is just gonna walk away from this?
Mesmo que ela morresse, eu deitava-te abaixo e matava-te.
Bem, agora é tarde.
A large quantity of CTX is going to be released into the city's water supply.
Everyone within a 100-mile radius is either going to be addicted or dead.
You got it all wrong, Aroon.
Oh, you're going to regret that, soldier boy.
I don't think so, guinea pig.
Revenge is a two-way street.
Vigia-o.
Eu vou buscar um medico.
Precisas de luz?
- We're being followed.
- Quem sao eles?
Eu nao sei.
I'm about to find out.
Eu penso que eles podem ser homens do Robinson's.
Posso lhe ajudar?
- Porque isto?
- Bem, porque tu estas a nos seguir.
Eu nao te estou seguindo.
You know what, man?
I bet you if I reach in your pocket...
- Sim,sim,sim.
- O que é isto?
Bem, ve agora, Naval Inteligencia.
Estou desapontado.
Tu mentiste-me.
Diz-me qualquer coisa.
Should we be cooperating with Robinson and Majestic?
None of that stuff works.
Entao tu estas-me a dizer que a Tia é a tua unica opçao?
Esta certo, baby.
Esta certo.
Diz-me o que sabes.
É o Majestic.
They're putting together another strike team.
Temos que tentar e convencer a Tia a se juntar a nos.
Sir, isto vai tornar-se feio.
I think the ship already sailed on that.
Continua contaminado.
Precisamos contactar o nosso pessoal, trazer-los para ca para sua propria proteçao.
Agora, tu sabes a liçao.
Agora, tu trabalhas com ele.
She wouldn't endanger the program, right?
Tu treinaste-os.
Eles ja trabalharem juntos antes.
Eles estao perto.
Nao te posso garantir nada.
So uma visita amiga.
- A tua ideia, ou a dele?
- Isso importa?
She might cut out your allowance.
Just like Robinson and Werner cut out yours?
- Only for a little while.
- I'm sure.
First, they need you in the trenches, with Marshall and his grunts.
I wouldn't be there if it wasn't for you.
Oh, come on.
The right deal will come along and you'll be a defector someday.
Not as a fugitive from the law.
Now, I may not have my own dentistry or retirement plan, exactly but I am doing what we love to do, Tia.
Well, enjoy it.
Because it ain't gonna last.
Oh, yes.
Of course.
I forgot.
Marshall.
You remember the excitement when we first sequenced the CTX formula?
You and I, we complement each other, Tia.
Work for me.
Work with me.
So do I take it that's a no?
Yes.
Of course, you realize there will be consequences.
- Were you followed?
- We were followed.
- But we took care of that.
- Good.
If words gets back to Werner that I'm talking to you guys...
I don't think you'll have to worry about Werner.
He might not be happy about our personal thing but he knows who sent me here and he knows why I'm here so he's not gonna say nothing to me.
My entire fucking team's wiped out so you know what would be really helpful right now?
If you stop feeding us this bullshit and give us decent intel that we can use.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Why do you think I'm here?
I'm very sorry about your team.
I'm sorry for your men.
But you know what I think would be very nice?
If you'd realize that I'm on your side.
You know Aroon's escaped.
He knows you're onto him.
And I know he's gonna follow through with his plans.
If that's the case, I'll brief your team on what kind of weapons will work and what won't.
- What will you do about Werner?
- Forget it.
I'll go to the admiral myself.
Believe me when I tell you, he will give us carte blanche for this mission.
They're Lambert's cops.
Let's have some fun.
Hey, guys, they are onto us.
Let's call for backup.
It is unfortunate you could not have persuaded Tia to join us.
She would have been a great asset.
Yes.
I'm sorry to have failed in that regard.
Don't be ridiculous.
Nothing can stop us from reaching our goal.
Tia and Marshall will be relentless now.
They'll do all that they can to hunt us down.
First, they have to find us.
Be assured, Marshall will use all of his resources to do that.
It will be too late.
Right?
- You want me to go ahead with it?
- I'm surprised you haven't already.
It was your idea, after all.
- It's fairly radical.
- Brilliant.
We are forced to react now.
Consider it done.
CTX will enter the city's water supply within an hour.
It'll spread very rapidly.
Most of the population will be addicted come, say, dinnertime.
Where is the other body?
Detective Lambert, phone.
The undercover agents are dead.
- All three of them?
- Yes, sir.
You wanted to see me?
We've had traces of CTX show up in the town's water supply.
Do we know where?
My intel is tracing the readings back to the source of the CTX.
Good, that is worth knowing.
How much time we got?
Current measurements predict 15,000 people will be fully addicted to CTX in the next 12 hours.
I'm afraid Werner and Robinson will let this happen and make us the scapegoats.
Marshall's not gonna let that happen.
He's got a new team together.
Tell Marshall I'm having his armory brought here.
Thanks for the decent intel.
You're welcome, soldier.
What are we doing here?
It's my place.
I have two agents here to brief us.
- Admiral, you wanted to see me?
- Yeah.
- Do I need to be worried?
- Not in the least.
- Everything's under control.
- Everything?
Are you keeping me informed of everything?
Admiral, I can handle it.
Handle it?
At the end of the day, none of this will ever have happened.
Okay?
I never liked the CTX program, or Werner and Robinson.
- Who handles the case locally?
- Detective Lambert, I believe.
I want to talk to him.
We're gonna have to start kicking over some trash cans.
Our low-orbiting recon has determined the parameters of their activities.
It includes the outskirts of the city, as well as...
Marshall, don't shoot.
We need her alive.
Nice timing, Dwayne.
Dwayne, get me the injured out of here, ASAP.
Get me a cleanup team in here, ASAP.
Got the Wicked Witch of the North here.
Try to secure her.
Get her into the Majestic lab and in interrogation, ASAP.
Dwayne, give me a hand, would you?
So, what's the intel?
We have confirmed reports of primary victims those most vulnerable to the infection.
Sadly, more of these will just pinpoint Aroon's base and the CTX lab.
- How are we gonna deal with them?
- The way we always do.
Let's go to the armory.
Marshall, I have these just for you.
These Nanographite blades were built for a man with your kind of fighting skills.
They are of the strongest substance known and will extend to fight as fast as the reflexes of the person using them.
Now, they're assimilated to your body.
They should balance the reflexes of someone addicted to CTX.
They'll come in handy.
I think this is a lot bigger than any one of us could have ever imagined.
I still got a few tricks up my sleeve.
I'm glad somebody does.
I'm gonna check it out.
What the fuck were they thinking?
It's just really a shame it turned out this way.
- What's the story with Tia?
- Tia's good.
That's my girl.
I trained her.
She has a lot of special abilities.
She has a lot of special technique.
She'll work out good for us.
We're fucked, aren't we?
I don't think so.
You think we have a chance?
I do.
Are you losing control of the situation?
They're in a secure area.
Nothing should endanger the program.
We are all in danger until they are dead.
Unless we can bring them to us, on our terms.
You got a plan?
Well, see, we're kind of between a rock and a hard place.
We had to come in here to get stuff we needed but as soon as we accessed the building, Werner knew.
So we got trouble.
I'm starting to think we should call for backup.
Unfortunately, it's not going to be backup that comes.
It's going to be a strike team to take us out.
Oh, shit.
Okay, guys.
Get your teams up and out.
I've got something to do here.
Let's go.
So, what have we got?
The old transit holding center has gone online, sir.
Which means they've occupied the building.
Send in a strike team.
Soft entry.
- Morgan's onto us.
- But he's not the problem.
We're talking mass hysteria if this gets out.
Let's make goddamned sure it doesn't.
Well, Reina.
Here are your choices: talk or die.
I hope you do the right thing because enough people have died already.
Where is Aroon's base?
Reina, do you hear me?
I'm running out of patience.
I will never tell you anything.
This time you really pissed me off.
You killed all of my best men.
That wasn't nice.
Now, you know what this will do to you.
Now, I'm going to give you about three seconds.
In three seconds, if you don't tell me I will kill you.
Just like you did to my men.
One.
Two.
Three.
Bastia!
Not so tough after all.
- She did the right thing.
- He's a very good listener.
Clear.
- Clear.
- Clear.
Clear.
- Clear.
- Sir?
They're gone.
Let's get out of here.
Damn it!
The lab has been completely wiped, sir.
We have a shitload of weapons missing and technology unaccounted for.
Who code-accessed the building?
The liaison, Tia.
And Marshall Lawson.
- You know him, right?
- Oh, yeah.
He's a headcase.
Does what he wants.
We had to transfer him out.
Where are they now?
We are using a tracking device as we speak.
Wait right there, sir.
This area is restricted.
Can I help you?
Detective Lambert.
Local police.
And?
These are undercover policemen.
My guys.
The autopsy showed up a big amount of a substance and the rumor is that it was developed by the military.
And you have evidence to support this?
Is three dead bodies not enough?
No.
I don't think I can help you.
You're wasting my time.
This is not military business.
Take it up with my superiors.
You bet I will.
Are you sure this is secure?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
I set it up.
- You don't think we should call it in?
- Let's get there first.
Bem,vamos telefornar-lhe quando for a altura certa.
Entao,o que é que vamos fazer?
Vamos mandar a nossa melhor equipa.
I've gone to a lot of trouble to teach my number one finest quem esta infectado com CTX e quem nao sabe.
Tu sabes isso.
Once they know we've made them Eles vao-nos matar muito rapido.
Ou é eles ou nos.
First come, first served.
It's off the A88.
Just east.
Posso falar contigo?
Sim.
Fala.
Em privado?
Certo.
Clean the slate.
Find the bitch and take her out.
Robinson, yeah.
Go ahead.
Nos os temos.
Safe house on the edge of town.
Make sure you get it right this time.
Eu penso que estamos a fazer a decisao certa.
Posso confiar em ti?
Espero que sim.
Tu sabes que eu cuido de ti.
Eu sei.
Eu tambem.
Identificaçao,por favor.
Hey.
Eu protejo a parte de tras.
A tua equipa,proteja a frente.
- Pronto.
- Pronto.
Mandaste-lhe uma equipa sem a minha autorizaçao?
Eu tenho que fazer uma decisao dificil.
Eu penso que é a certa.
You seriously underestimated Marshall and his abilities.
Temos uma chamada segura vindo para voce, admiral.
O que é isto?
Nao diz.
But he's on one of our secure walkies.
- Patch him into the speakerphone.
- Done.
Agora esta com ele.
- Admiral?
- O que eu posso fazer para voce, Marshall?
I'm flattered, really flattered, you recognize my voice.
You're the only one to pull a stunt like this.
Estou a assumir que a equipa strike esta morta.
Yeah, that's a good assumption.
Tell Werner he needs to get up earlier than that.
A base de Aroon's foi localizada in a small village somewhere outside of Bordeaux called...
Basta.
Basta.
Eu nao posso esconder isto.
Marshall diz-me quando e onde.
All right.
I'll send you an encryption with the gory details but suffice it to say that I'd like my favorite A-team to shoot in here right quick.
E vamos fazer isto a maneira antiga.
Apesar de tudo parece que vamos trabalhar juntos.
I'll provide the intel and the training, tu das-me o homem.
Ordena a companhia-B para parar .
Let's move out.
Se matermos o elemento surpresa enquanto as secçoes entrem e procurem a vila depois eu irei lidar a força de ataque and push forward towards Aroon's base.
Any specifics that the Army should know about?
Olha para a rapida pulsaçao nos olhos.
Se tu ves isto, tu nao tens tempo.
Because of the CTX, they are pumped full of adrenaline giving them almost superhuman strength and reflexes.
Eu digo, outra vez, eles sao animals para te matar a ti e ao teu homem.
E sobre a contaminaçao, Marshall?
Acreditamos que este seja o perimetro seguro and we will be able to stop any breaches.
Oh, I'm pleased to hear that, Marshall.
But if this fucks up, se o mundo vai abaixo you're going to have to go down with it.
Bem, no caso, talvez possa-mos trazer o Werner connosco.
He can report back to you everything we're doing.
O que é isso?
Boa ideia.
Bem, eu estou...
Eu nao estou cansado.
Esta bem.
Nos pomos camos em ti e damos a ti uma arma e deixamos vires connosco.
Detective Lambert for Admiral Morgan.
Sir,tem uma chamada para voce.
Tu disses te para telefonar-te com informaçoes.
Eu estou aqui na catedral.
Isto é para onde deves mandar as tuas tropas.
Tu sabes esta fora da minha jurisdiçao.
It's okay, we're on it.
Okay, salut.
Troops are on the outskirts of Bastia, admiral.
Secçao um em posiçao.
Secçao dois em posiçao.
Secçao tres em posiçao.
Marshall?
This is Marshall.
Go ahead, admiral.
Our intel tracking tells us they have gone to ground in an old church.
Eu tenho essas coordenadas, sir.
And, Marshall my troops are still deployed in the village.
Nao te posso mandar nenhum backup.
Por aqui,tu e os teus homens estao por vossa conta.Boa sorte.
Recebi isso,senhor.
Let's check out the guardhouse.
Esta bem,nao te mexas.
So umas perguntas para ti-.
Deixa-nos a sos.
Quem é que esta na catedral?
Eu nao sei.
Watch their eyes for CTX symptoms.
Quieto, nao te mexas.
Ve os olhos dele para ver se a mudanças na dilataçao.
-TDiz-me senao eu mato-te.
-Vai-te lixar.
They're on CTX.
I can see it.
Nao te mexas.
Let's head to the cathedral.
Os olhos,ve os olhos dele.
Ve os olhos dele.
Pronto.
Levanta-te.
Este esta bem.
Vamos, homem.
Ele esta bem.
Vamos.
Vamos.
- O que é isto?
- Nada.
Gotta be something to make you hang back.
Right, let's just keep up with Marshall.
El vai ficar bem
Temos que confiar nos nossos instintos para sair daqui vivos.
- Entao, o que é isto, soldado?
- Aroon's lab.
Ele tem que tar por aqui.
-Vamos dar uma olhada.
- Esta bem.
- CTX?
- Yeah.
It's still unrefined.
It needs to dry out to get its powder form.
How much is all this worth?
Suficiente para ficar assustado.
Mesmo assustador.
Merda.
Ele fez isto.
It's the city's water supply system.
-E?
- Ele comtaminou isto.
Effective enough for a hundred-mile radius.
Maldito!
Estamos nos dividindo em quatro.
A-team vao para a esquerda B- team goes to the right, let's go.
Eu disse te que haveria consequencias.
Dwayne, lead the B-team.
Sim,senhor.
Vamos.
Nobu, vamos.
Senhor?
Fuck.
Vamos.
Eu perdi todos, senhor.
Eles estao todos mortos.
So agora vies te para me matar, Marshall.
Mas como tu sabes, revenge is a two-way street.
Talvez consideres unindo forças?
Eu vejo, claro que nao.
Tu es um militar, um homem com honra e integridade.
Isso é tao mau.
In that case, you will all die.
I promise you.
Nobu and I will take this bitch.
Dwayne, watch the back door.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
MOVIE STARTS IN, LIKE, 15 MINUTES.
YOU WANNA PICK UP THE PACE, ARTHUR?
EXCUSE ME FOR CHEWING.
IT'S MASHED POTATOES.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHEW EVERY BITE 48 TIMES.
NOT ALL OF US HAVE A WORKING STOMACH.
I DIGEST MOST OF MY FOOD IN MY MOUTH.
WHERE DO YOU DIGEST THE REST, ON YOUR SHIRT?
OH, HEY, DANNY.
HEY, MAN.
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?
AH, I JUST WANNA CATCH THE REST OF THE NETS GAME.
OH, BEAUTIFUL.

THANKS, MAN.
THANK YOU.
HEY, YOU AND THE NETS
WANNA BUY ME A GUCCI PURSE?
YEAH, SURE.
MAYBE WE'LL GET ONE FOR YOU, TOO, DOUGIE.
WHAT JUST HAPPENED HERE?
HOW-HOW'D IT GET TIED?
IT WAS ACTUALLY A 3-POINTER AND 2 TECHNICAL FOULS.
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.
OH, MY GOD, I CAN'T- A STEAL NOW.
OH, MY GOD.
COVER HIM.
JUST COVER HIM.
COVER HIM.
GAH!
AHH!
2 MONTHS' RENT.
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY, WE GOTTA GO,
BUT THANKS FOR DINNER.
APPRECIATE IT.
THOUGHT DOUG AND CARRIE LEFT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WATCHING YOU WALLOW IN A PLACE
I LIKE TO CALL ROCK BOTTOM.
WHAT?
I STAYED TO HELP YOU.
I'M DUE FOR A HOT STREAK.
I KNOW IT.
I SAID THE SAME THING AFTER I WAGERED
ON PRESIDENT THOMAS E. DEWEY
AND A SERIES OF WHITE HEAVYWEIGHTS.
I KICKED MY HABIT.
NOW YOU'VE GOTTA KICK YOURS.
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, ARTHUR, I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN,
BUT I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.
LOOK AT YOURSELF!
DESPERATE AND PENNILESS!
TROLLING THE MEN'S ROOM
FOR ANY TRUCKER WITH 6 BITS IN HIS POCKET.
I JUST CAME IN HERE TO PEE.
THAT'S HOW IT STARTS.
ALL RIGHT, MAYBE I DO HAVE A PROBLEM,
BUT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO, GO TO, LIKE, GAMBLERS ANONYMOUS?
HUMPH.
WHERE THEY CODDLE YOU
WITH THEIR UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORT.
HARDLY.
I'M GONNA CURE YOU.
REALLY?
YES.
FROM NOW ON, THE ONLY MONKEY ON YOUR BACK
IS GONNA BE ME.
I'M JUST SAYIN' THAT'S THE LAST TIME
I'M LETTING YOU PICK THE MOVIE.
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF YOU WON'T WEAR THE 3-D GLASSES,
YOU DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO CRITICIZE.
WHOA.
LOOK AT YOUR BOOBS.
THEY'RE COMIN' RIGHT AT ME.
NOT TONIGHT THEY AIN'T.
HEY, WHAT'S WITH THE POLICE BARRICADES?
OK, MY GUESS, YOUR DAD HAD A LITTLE TOO MUCH
COUGH SYRUP, AND HE CURSED OUT A NEIGHBOR.
HEY, LOU, WHAT'S GOIN' ON?
UM, WE'RE HAVIN' A BLOCK PARTY.
OH, COOL.
WHAT TIME'S IT, UH, START?
UM, YOU'RE PUTTING ME IN A VERY AWKWARD POSITION.
WHY?
WE WEREN'T INVITED?
I WANTED YOU GUYS TO COME,
BUT THE OTHERS SHOT ME DOWN PRETTY QUICK.
SORRY.
NO, NOTHIN' TO BE SORRY ABOUT.
IT'S OK.
YEAH.
I DON'T THINK WE CAN MAKE IT ANYWAY,
BECAUSE WE'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A, UH,
AHEM, PRETTY INTENSE GAME OF BATTLESHIP.
WELL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.
IT IS FUN, DAMN FUN.
HEY.
FOUND BATTLESHIP, BUT MOST OF THE PEGS ARE MISSING.
YEAH.
I THINK MY DAD THOUGHT THEY WERE TIC TACS.
I DOUBT IT.
I'VE BEEN TRYIN' TO GET HIM ON THOSE FOR YEARS.
ANYWAY, I DON'T WANNA PLAY.
MY NECK IS KILLING ME.
COULD YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE-LITTLE MASSAGE?
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
THEY'RE GOIN' ALL OUT ON THIS BLOCK PARTY.
THEY GOT A REGGAE BAND.
ARE THEY MAKIN' FUNNEL CAKES?
ALL RIGHT, WOULD YOU STOP LOOKIN' OUT THE WINDOW?
I'M JUST SAYIN', IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE HAVIN' A GOOD TIME.
OH, REALLY?
GOOD TIME?
WH-WHAT TIME IS IT?
9:15?
I'M GONNA CALL THE COPS.
CARRIE, COME ON.
COME ON.
WHAT?
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
I'M JUST SAYIN',
DON'T YOU FEEL A LITTLE WEIRD THAT...
I MEAN, THERE'S A BLOCK PARTY OUT THERE,
AND WE'RE THE ONLY COUPLE ON THE BLOCK NOT INVITED?
I MEAN, LOOK, THERE'S EVEN THE GUY
WHO EVERYBODY THINKS KILLED HIS WIFE.
HE'S OUT THERE.
DOUG, IT'S A BLOCK PARTY.
REALLY, WHAT ARE WE MISSING?
"OH, I LIKE THE ONION DIP."
"WHY, HASN'T BILLY GROWN?" PLEASE.
I AM MISSING THAT.
I LOVE ONION DIP,
AND I GOTTA TELL YOU, BILLY HAS SHOT UP THESE LAST 6 MONTHS.
IT'S A MOOT POINT ANYWAY.
THE NEIGHBORS HATE US.
SO WHAT?
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
SO, WH-WHY DON'T WE GO DOWN THERE
AND SHOW 'EM THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY NICE PEOPLE?
HOW 'BOUT THIS?
YOU GO.
I STAY
AND TRY SOME OF THESE, UH, LEFTOVER PAINKILLERS FROM MY GUM SURGERY?
I WILL.
LOU'S IN THE DUNK TANK.
I'M GOIN' DOWN THERE RIGHT NOW.
HEY.
DOUG HEFFERNAN, 3121.
OH.
YEAH, AREN'T YOU THE PEOPLE WHO CALLED THE COPS
ON OUR LAST BLOCK PARTY?
YOU SAID THERE WAS GANG ACTIVITY GOING ON.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT WAS MY WIFE.
I GOTTA TELL YOU, WE'RE NOT REALLY CLOSE.
HEY, PHIL.
OH.
HEY, DOUG.
HEY, GLENN.
HEY, I GOTTA TELL YOU,
I LOVE THE WAY YOUR GARDEN'S BEEN LOOKIN'.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THAT HEAT WAVE KILLED ALMOST EVERYTHING.
YEAH, BUT LESS IS MORE, YOU KNOW.
HEY, WHO'S THIS HANDSOME FELLA, HUH?
LOOK AT YOU.
THIS IS SPARKY.
OH.
YOU LIKE DOGS, DOUG?
NO.
I REALLY DON'T.
I LOVE 'EM.
OH.
DO YOU HAVE A DOG?
NO, I DON'T.
BUT I'LL TELL YOU, IF I FOUND ONE
AS CUTE AS THIS ONE, I'D PULL THE TRIGGER IN A SECOND.
WELL, YOU CAN HAVE HIM.
COME AGAIN?
SPARKY ISN'T MINE.
I VOLUNTEER AT THE ANIMAL SHELTER,
AND I'M JUST KEEPING HIM FOR THE WEEKEND.
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY, DOUG?
IS THERE ENOUGH ROOM IN YOUR HEART?
DOUG.
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
TAKE IT EASY.
I'M SORRY.
I'M JUST NOT USED TO WAKING UP
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING TO A STRANGE DOG IN OUR BED.
ACTUALLY, IT'S LIKE 1:30 IN THE AFTERNOON, SO...
SERIOUSLY?
WOW.
THEY WEREN'T KIDDING WHEN THEY SAID DON'T MIX WITH ALCOHOL.
YOU FOUND OUT THE HARD WAY.
ANYWAY, THIS IS MY NEW DOG, SPARKY.
I'LL BE BACK IN A LITTLE BIT-
WHOA.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
NOTHING.
I JUST
- I ADOPTED A DOG AT THE
- AT THE BLOCK PARTY.
MOST PEOPLE GO TO A BLOCK PARTY
AND COME BACK WITH A PIE, NOT A DOG.
OK, I DID BRING HOME A PIE.
YOU MISSED IT.
AGAIN, IT'S, LIKE, 1:30 IN THE AFTERNOON.
ALL RIGHT, HONEY, PLEASE, JUST TAKE IT BACK TO WHERE HE CAME FROM, PLEASE.
CARE, COME ON, IT'S BECAUSE OF HIM
THAT THE NEIGHBORS FINALLY LIKE US.
AND WITH ALL THE RUNNING AND-HEH
- PLAYING AROUND WITH HIM,
BONUS.
YOU KNOW WHY?
WASHBOARD.
AH, IT'S GONNA HELP YOU LOSE WEIGHT.
OK.
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU SAID
WHEN YOU TALKED ME INTO GETTING YOU THAT DUNE BUGGY?
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
WHEN I FLIPPED THAT THING
AND I GOT MY JAW WIRED SHUT, I LOST, LIKE, 41/2 POUNDS.
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT, DOUG?
YOU WANT THE DOG, FINE.
IT'S YOURS.
IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.
YOU'RE GONNA FEED HIM.
YOU'RE GONNA WALK HIM, IT'S ALL ON YOU.
ABSOLUTELY.
GONNA FEED HIM RIGHT NOW.
COME ON, LET'S GO FINISH THAT PIE.
DON'T FORGET TO SEPARATE THE WHITES FROM THE COLORS.
YEAH, WELL, HAVIN' A LITTLE TROUBLE
FIGURIN' OUT WHICH ONES ARE THE WHITES.
WATCH THE 'TUDE, JUNKIE.
LOOK, I STILL DON'T GET IT.
I MEAN, HOW IS DOING YOUR LAUNDRY
HELPIN' ME GET OVER MY GAMBLING PROBLEM?
WHEN YOU CAME DOWN HERE,
WHAT DID YOU WANNA DO MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE?
WELL, OPEN A WINDOW.
THEN I WANTED TO CALL MY BOOKIE TO MAKE A COUPLE OF BETS.
I LIKE THE KNICKS, AND THE LAKERS, THEY'RE A LOCK.
AND DID YOU PLACE THOSE BETS?
NO.
AND WHY NOT?
BECAUSE THE DIAL ON YOUR PHONE WAS JAMMED WITH GUM.
NO, BECAUSE I'M KEEPING YOUR STUBBY FINGERS BUSY.
NOW KEEP SORTING.
I'M JUST TELLIN' YOU, GUY, IF YOU DON'T STRETCH NOW,
YOU'RE GONNA FEEL IT TOMORROW.
WHO'S THIS?
OH, IT'S MY NEW DOG, SPARKY.
SPARKY, THIS IS ARTHUR.
WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T SNIFF HIS BUTT.
AH.
JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR,
THE LIVER TREATS IN THE PANTRY ARE MINE.
OH.
IS THIS THE KNICK GAME?
IT WAS.
THEY JUST CRUSHED THE TRAILBLAZERS.
OH.
DID THEY?
AND, UH, WOULD YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW
HOW THE LAKERS FARED?
THEY WON BY, LIKE, 30.
REALLY?
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE'S BACK ON A HOT STREAK.
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.
LET'S GO FIND US SOME BITCHES.
NO, I HAVEN'T DECIDED WHO I'M BETTIN' ON TONIGHT.
HEH.
YES, FAT CHARLIE, I'VE BEEN ON QUITE A HOT STREAK.
SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.
HOLD ON.
HEY, ARTHUR.
HEY!
HOW'S MY FAVORITE RECOVERING ADDICT?
EHH.
HANGIN' IN THERE.
HAVE A SEAT.
LET ME JUST MOVE THESE BOAT CATALOGS.
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT TEAMS
YOUR DISEASED MIND IS OBSESSED WITH TODAY.
WELL, ACTUALLY INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT BASKETBALL
AND, YOU KNOW, SHOCKIN' ME WITH A CAR BATTERY,
I
- I THOUGHT MAYBE WE CAN, I DON'T KNOW,
GET TO THE ROOT OF MY PROBLEM.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WELL, I WAS THINKIN'
THIS WHOLE GAMBLIN' THING MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH MY FATHER NEVER GIVING ME HIS APPROVAL.
OK, LET'S WORK WITH THAT.
GREAT.
GREAT.
NOW, IF YOUR FATHER ASKED YOU WHO TO BET ON TONIGHT,
WHAT TEAM WOULD YOU PICK TO EARN HIS APPROVAL,
THE CELTICS OR THE TIMBERWOLVES?
WHAT?
CELTICS, I GUESS.
AHA.
AND IF HIS LOVE HINGED ON PICKING THE OVER-UNDER...
UNDER.
UNDER!
RIGHTO.
GOD, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I REALLY GOTTA GET A HANDLE ON THIS,
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW, SOMETIMES I JUST FEEL SO DESPERATE
THAT I-I FEEL LIKE GETTIN' UP ON THE ROOF AND-
LET'S PICK THIS UP TOMORROW.
ONE DAY AT A TIME.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
HEY, WHAT'S UP?
I WAS JUST UPSTAIRS,
AND APPARENTLY SOMEBODY PEED IN THE HALLWAY.
YEAH, THAT WAS ME.
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS ISN'T WORKIN' OUT FOR ME.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?
DOUG, YOU TOOK A PERFECTLY GOOD DOG
AND TURNED HIM INTO A BIG, LAZY EATING MACHINE.
AND IN CASE YOU HADN'T NOTICED,
ALREADY GOT ONE OF THOSE.
OH!
SLAMMED ME THERE.
HEH HEH.
COME ON.
SIT DOWN.
WATCH THE TUBE.
EAT SOME DOODLES WITH US.
IT'S FUN.
OK, ALL RIGHT,
NOW, H-HERE'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
OK, YOU'RE GONNA WAKE UP EVERY MORNING EARLY,
AND YOU'RE GONNA WALK HIM,
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA FEED HIM DOG FOOD,
AND THEN IF HE PEES IN THE HOUSE,
YOU'RE GONNA CLEAN IT UP,
AND IF YOU CAN'T DO ALL THOSE THINGS,
HE'S GOIN' RIGHT BACK TO WHERE HE CAME FROM.
I'M GONNA MISS YOU, BUDDY.
COME ON, BOY.
GOTTA TAKE YOU BACK.
BELIEVE ME, IF I COULD TRADE PLACES WITH YOU, I WOULD.
CARRIE, I'M GLAD I CAUGHT YOU.
I WANTED TO DROP OFF THIS DOG TRAINING VIDEO.
IT'S NARRATED BY BETTY WHITE.
OH, RIGHT.
THAT'S GREAT, BUT I'M ACTUALLY NOT GONNA BE NEEDING IT, SO-AHH!
YOU OK?
YEAH, IT'S JUST I GOT A PINCHED NERVE
IN MY NECK.
IT'S KILLIN' ME.
YOU KNOW, I HAD THAT SAME TROUBLE
UNTIL I GOT MY MASSAGE CHAIR.
IT'S CHANGED MY LIFE.
OH, YEAH, I PRICED ONE OF THOSE.
AND UNLESS I'M GOIN' HOME WITH ONE OF THE SALESMEN, AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN.
ACTUALLY, ONE OF MY CLIENTS MANUFACTURES THEM,
SO I CAN GET YOU ONE AT A THIRD OF THE STORE PRICE.
REALLY?
YOU WOULD DO THAT?
AFTER WHAT YOU GUYS DID RESCUING SPARKY,
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.
BLESS YOUR HEARTS.
WELL, DON'T BLESS US.
BLESS ALL OF GOD'S CREATURES.
WELL, I CAN'T TAKE HIM BACK.
WHAT?
WHAT HAPPENED?
GLENN'S GONNA GET ME AN INCREDIBLE DEAL
ON A MASSAGE CHAIR BECAUSE HE THINKS I'M A GOOD PERSON.
I GOTTA KEEP THAT GOIN'.
WELL, HAVE FUN WITH HIM, 'CAUSE I MOVED ON.
I'M THINKIN' ABOUT GETTIN' A BIRD NOW.
WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?
THE DOG WAS YOUR IDEA IN THE FIRST PLACE.
I DON'T WANNA TAKE CARE OF HIM.
SO THINK OF SOMETHING.
WELL?
SORRY.
I'M THINKIN' OF BIRD NAMES.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF CHET?
OK, HOW ABOUT THIS?
WE TAKE HIM TO THE SHELTER,
AND WE TELL PEOPLE THAT HE RAN AWAY.
THAT WAY, WE STILL GET CREDIT FOR THE RESCUE,
PLUS SYMPATHY FOR THE LOSS.
WIN-WIN.
UH-UH.
NO WAY.
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.
GLENN'S DOWN AT THE SHELTER
RESCUING A LLAMA OR WHATEVER EVERY DAY.
WHAT IF WE TAKE HIM OUT OF STATE, LIKE, TO JERSEY?
MMM.
TOO CLOSE.
TOO CLOSE.
PENNSYLVANIA.
AMISH COUNTRY.
ALL RIGHT, BUT IT'S GONNA SUCK FOR HIM, 'CAUSE HE LIKES TV.
HEY, DID YOU PUT UP THE LOST DOG POSTERS?
YEAH.
THEN LOU GAVE ME A HELL OF A SYMPATHY HUG.
I THINK HE SEPARATED MY SHOULDER, SO IT...
WELL, DON'T WORRY.
GLENN SAID OUR MASSAGE CHAIR IS COMIN' TODAY.
OOH.
MAYBE THAT'S IT.
MIRACLES DO HAPPEN.
SPARKY?
HE'S BACK?
IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT,
HE MADE IT ALL THE WAY TO LANCASTER, PENNSYLVANIA.
LUCKY FOR YOU, THEY WERE ABLE TO SCAN HIS MICROCHIP IMPLANT.
MICROCHIP.
WOW.
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE AMISH HAD SCANNERS?
WELL, THE IMPORTANT THING IS HE'S HOME NOW,
AND YOUR FAMILY IS WHOLE.
THANK YOU.
ARTHUR, HEY.
OH, THERE YOU ARE.
LET'S PROBE YOUR INNER DEMONS
VIS-À-VIS TONIGHT'S PACERS-CAVALIERS GAME.
OH.
WELL, I, UH- I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT GAMBLIN' IN DAYS.
WHAT?
YEAH.
I THINK I'M, UH, FINALLY CURED.
YOUR THERAPY WORKED.
AND, UH, TO THANK YOU, I GOT YOU THIS PLANT.
DON'T BE A FOOL.
THINKING YOU'RE CURED IS PART OF THE DISEASE.
HEY, THAT COST ME 6 BUCKS AT WALGREENS.
I DON'T CARE.
JUST TELL ME WHO'S GONNA WIN TONIGHT.
WAIT A MINUTE.
HAVE YOU BEEN BETTING USING MY PICKS?
HELLO.
SORRY.
I ASSUMED THAT WAS A RHETORICAL QUESTION.
OF COURSE THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN DOIN'.
AH.
SO THAT EXPLAINS THE FANCY JEWELRY
AND THE WOMEN AND ALL THE FUR HATS.
YOU SAID YOU WERE HELPIN' ME.
OK, I DECEIVED YOU, AND THAT WAS WRONG.
BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE REASON
I STARTED HELPING YOU TO BEGIN WITH.
I LOVE YOU, DANIEL.
SO, PACERS-CAVALIERS-
AH, YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE.
PLEASE.
IF I CAN DOUBLE UP ON TONIGHT'S GAME,
I CAN GET MYSELF OUT OF THIS HELLHOLE!
YEAH, WELL, YOU CAN FORGET IT, OK?
'CAUSE YOU'VE SUCKED FROM DANNY HEFFERNAN'S TEAT FOR THE LAST TIME.
ONE MORE, SON?
NO!
GOOD.
I DON'T NEED YOU.
I CAN MAKE SOME VERY SAVVY PICKS ON MY OWN!
LET'S SEE.
CAVALIERS-PACERS.
OH.
CAVALIERS AND PACERS.
MY COUSIN JEFFREY USED TO DRIVE A PACER,
ALTHOUGH HE HAD A VERY CAVALIER ATTITUDE ABOUT IT.
FREE DOG!
WE GOT A FREE DOG HERE.
MAN'S BEST FRIEND.
EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE ONE.
LADY, TAKE IT HOME WITH YOU.
TAKE IT HOME WITH YOU.
WHAT DO YOU SAY THERE, GRAMPS?
COME ON.
BRING HIM WITH YOU.
BRING HIM WITH YOU.
THERE'S-NOBODY'S TAKIN' HIM.
YOU WANNA KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE NOBODY'S SEEN HIM MOVE.
YOU TURNED HIM INTO YOU.
NO WONDER NOBODY WANTS HIM.
YOU WANTED ME.
YEAH, THAT WAS A MILLION YEARS AGO, BUDDY.
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
L

LET ME HANDLE THIS.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHERE YOU GOIN' SO FAST, SWEETHEART?
EXCUSE ME?
YEAH, UH, SEE, THING IS

YOU SEEM LIKE A DOG GUY,
AND I JUST LOVE DOG GUYS.
YEAH, THAT'S- THAT'S GREAT.
UH, I'M LATE FOR SOMETHING.
ALL RIGHTY.
NICE GOIN'.
I TRIED.
YEAH.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NEXT TIME, POP A BUTTON OR PUT A HAND ON HIM.
ALWAYS BE CLOSING.
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THERE'S A BUNCH OF FAMILIES OVER THERE BY THE SWINGS.
COME ON.
SOMEBODY WILL TAKE HIM OVER THERE.
HERE WE GO, MAN.
GO GET IT!
COME ON, NOW.
GO!
GO ON, NOW.
GO-GET OUT OF HERE!
WE DON'T LOVE YOU!
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S JUST GO.
ALL RIGHT.
HEY, MAN.
HEY.
HEH.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
UM, JUST PLAYIN' WITH OUR DOG.
YEAH.
LITTLE GAME CALLED, "GET OUT OF HERE.
WE DON'T LOVE YOU."
IF YOU CAN'T MUSTER THE COMPASSION IN YOUR HEARTS
TO CARE FOR THIS POOR CREATURE,
I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE HIM BACK.
AWESOME!
THAT SOUNDS REALLY GREAT.
THANK YOU.
WAIT.
QUICK QUESTION, THOUGH.
IF WE GIVE HIM BACK TO YOU,
WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US,
MASSAGE-CHAIRWISE?
CARRIE, I PROMISED YOU A CHAIR.
IT'LL BE HERE TODAY.
AH, A MAN OF HIS WORD.
I LIKE IT.
KUDOS.
SO YOU, UH-YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA TELL THE NEIGHBORS ABOUT THIS.
NO, DOUG.
YOUR SELFISH AND DECEITFUL BEHAVIOR WILL BE OUR SECRET.
THIS JUST KEEPS GETTIN' BETTER.
BRING IT UP, BUDDY.
ALL RIGHT, BUB.
YOU'RE AWESOME.
WE'LL SEE YOU AT THE NEXT BLOCK PARTY.
JUST KIDDIN'.
WE'LL STAY HOME.
WE'LL STAY...
SO, WE'RE SQUARE, FAT CHARLIE?
HEY, WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON?
I HAD A SMALL GAMBLING DEBT TO SETTLE.
SO YOU GAVE THE GUY MY NEW MASSAGE CHAIR?
AND DOUGLAS' AUTOGRAPHED NOLAN RYAN BASEBALL.
YOU'RE SO DEAD, OLD MAN.
GET IN THE HOUSE RIGHT NOW.
UNBELIEVABLE.
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU, DAD.
I TOLD YOU THEY WERE BAD PEOPLE.
COME ON, SNOWFLAKE.
DOES HE BELONG TO YOU?
FOUND HIM WANDERING AROUND IN AMISH COUNTRY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
MOVIE STARTS IN, LIKE, 15 MINUTES.
YOU WANNA PICK UP THE PACE, ARTHUR?
EXCUSE ME FOR CHEWING.
IT'S MASHED POTATOES.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHEW EVERY BITE 48 TIMES.
NOT ALL OF US HAVE A WORKING STOMACH.
I DIGEST MOST OF MY FOOD IN MY MOUTH.
WHERE DO YOU DIGEST THE REST, ON YOUR SHIRT?
OH, HEY, DANNY.
HEY, MAN.
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?
AH, I JUST WANNA CATCH THE REST OF THE NETS GAME.
OH, BEAUTIFUL.
UP 5 POINTS WITH 19 SECONDS TO GO.
YOU GOT SOME, UH- GOT SOME MONEY ON IT?
YEAH, A COUPLE SHEKELS.
COME ON, BABY.
COME ON.
THAT'S IT.
RUN OUT THE CLOCK.
HERE'S YOUR CHECK.
OH, HEY, NO, WAIT.
THAT'S, UH, ON ME TONIGHT
AND, UH, THE NEW JERSEY NETS.
THANKS, MAN.
THANK YOU.
HEY, YOU AND THE NETS
WANNA BUY ME A GUCCI PURSE?
YEAH, SURE.
MAYBE WE'LL GET ONE FOR YOU, TOO, DOUGIE.
WHAT JUST HAPPENED HERE?
HOW-HOW'D IT GET TIED?
IT WAS ACTUALLY A 3-POINTER AND 2 TECHNICAL FOULS.
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.
OH, MY GOD, I CAN'T- A STEAL NOW.
OH, MY GOD.
COVER HIM.
JUST COVER HIM.
COVER HIM.
GAH!
AHH!
2 MONTHS' RENT.
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY, WE GOTTA GO,
BUT THANKS FOR DINNER.
APPRECIATE IT.
THOUGHT DOUG AND CARRIE LEFT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WATCHING YOU WALLOW IN A PLACE
I LIKE TO CALL ROCK BOTTOM.
WHAT?
I STAYED TO HELP YOU.
YOUR GAMBLING IS CLEARLY OUT OF CONTROL.
NAH, NAH, NAH.
I'M JUST RUNNIN' COLD, ALL RIGHT?
I'M DUE FOR A HOT STREAK.
I KNOW IT.
I SAID THE SAME THING AFTER I WAGERED
ON PRESIDENT THOMAS E. DEWEY
AND A SERIES OF WHITE HEAVYWEIGHTS.
I KICKED MY HABIT.
NOW YOU'VE GOTTA KICK YOURS.
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, ARTHUR, I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN,
BUT I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.
LOOK AT YOURSELF!
DESPERATE AND PENNILESS!
TROLLING THE MEN'S ROOM
FOR ANY TRUCKER WITH 6 BITS IN HIS POCKET.
I JUST CAME IN HERE TO PEE.
THAT'S HOW IT STARTS.
ALL RIGHT, MAYBE I DO HAVE A PROBLEM,
BUT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO, GO TO, LIKE, GAMBLERS ANONYMOUS?
HUMPH.
WHERE THEY CODDLE YOU
WITH THEIR UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORT.
HARDLY.
I'M GONNA CURE YOU.
REALLY?
YES.
FROM NOW ON, THE ONLY MONKEY ON YOUR BACK
IS GONNA BE ME.
I'M JUST SAYIN' THAT'S THE LAST TIME
I'M LETTING YOU PICK THE MOVIE.
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF YOU WON'T WEAR THE 3-D GLASSES,
YOU DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO CRITICIZE.
WHOA.
LOOK AT YOUR BOOBS.
THEY'RE COMIN' RIGHT AT ME.
NOT TONIGHT THEY AIN'T.
HEY, WHAT'S WITH THE POLICE BARRICADES?
OK, MY GUESS, YOUR DAD HAD A LITTLE TOO MUCH
COUGH SYRUP, AND HE CURSED OUT A NEIGHBOR.
HEY, LOU, WHAT'S GOIN' ON?
UM, WE'RE HAVIN' A BLOCK PARTY.
OH, COOL.
WHAT TIME'S IT, UH, START?
UM, YOU'RE PUTTING ME IN A VERY AWKWARD POSITION.
WHY?
WE WEREN'T INVITED?
I WANTED YOU GUYS TO COME,
BUT THE OTHERS SHOT ME DOWN PRETTY QUICK.
SORRY.
NO, NOTHIN' TO BE SORRY ABOUT.
IT'S OK.
YEAH.
I DON'T THINK WE CAN MAKE IT ANYWAY,
BECAUSE WE'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A, UH,
AHEM, PRETTY INTENSE GAME OF BATTLESHIP.
WELL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.
IT IS FUN, DAMN FUN.
HEY.
FOUND BATTLESHIP, BUT MOST OF THE PEGS ARE MISSING.
YEAH.
I THINK MY DAD THOUGHT THEY WERE TIC TACS.
I DOUBT IT.
I'VE BEEN TRYIN' TO GET HIM ON THOSE FOR YEARS.
ANYWAY, I DON'T WANNA PLAY.
MY NECK IS KILLING ME.
COULD YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE-LITTLE MASSAGE?
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
THEY'RE GOIN' ALL OUT ON THIS BLOCK PARTY.
THEY GOT A REGGAE BAND.
ARE THEY MAKIN' FUNNEL CAKES?
ALL RIGHT, WOULD YOU STOP LOOKIN' OUT THE WINDOW?
I'M JUST SAYIN', IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE HAVIN' A GOOD TIME.
OH, REALLY?
GOOD TIME?
WH-WHAT TIME IS IT?
9:15?
I'M GONNA CALL THE COPS.
CARRIE, COME ON.
COME ON.
WHAT?
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
I'M JUST SAYIN',
DON'T YOU FEEL A LITTLE WEIRD THAT...
I MEAN, THERE'S A BLOCK PARTY OUT THERE,
AND WE'RE THE ONLY COUPLE ON THE BLOCK NOT INVITED?
I MEAN, LOOK, THERE'S EVEN THE GUY
WHO EVERYBODY THINKS KILLED HIS WIFE.
HE'S OUT THERE.
DOUG, IT'S A BLOCK PARTY.
REALLY, WHAT ARE WE MISSING?
"OH, I LIKE THE ONION DIP."
"WHY, HASN'T BILLY GROWN?" PLEASE.
I AM MISSING THAT.
I LOVE ONION DIP,
AND I GOTTA TELL YOU, BILLY HAS SHOT UP THESE LAST 6 MONTHS.
IT'S A MOOT POINT ANYWAY.
THE NEIGHBORS HATE US.
SO WHAT?
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
SO, WH-WHY DON'T WE GO DOWN THERE
AND SHOW 'EM THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY NICE PEOPLE?
HOW 'BOUT THIS?
YOU GO.
I STAY
AND TRY SOME OF THESE, UH, LEFTOVER PAINKILLERS FROM MY GUM SURGERY?
I WILL.
LOU'S IN THE DUNK TANK.
I'M GOIN' DOWN THERE RIGHT NOW.
HEY.
DOUG HEFFERNAN, 3121.
OH.
YEAH, AREN'T YOU THE PEOPLE WHO CALLED THE COPS
ON OUR LAST BLOCK PARTY?
YOU SAID THERE WAS GANG ACTIVITY GOING ON.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT WAS MY WIFE.
I GOTTA TELL YOU, WE'RE NOT REALLY CLOSE.
HEY, PHIL.
OH.
HEY, DOUG.
HEY, GLENN.
HEY, I GOTTA TELL YOU,
I LOVE THE WAY YOUR GARDEN'S BEEN LOOKIN'.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THAT HEAT WAVE KILLED ALMOST EVERYTHING.
YEAH, BUT LESS IS MORE, YOU KNOW.
HEY, WHO'S THIS HANDSOME FELLA, HUH?
LOOK AT YOU.
THIS IS SPARKY.
OH.
YOU LIKE DOGS, DOUG?
NO.
I REALLY DON'T.
I LOVE 'EM.
OH.
DO YOU HAVE A DOG?
NO, I DON'T.
BUT I'LL TELL YOU, IF I FOUND ONE
AS CUTE AS THIS ONE, I'D PULL THE TRIGGER IN A SECOND.
WELL, YOU CAN HAVE HIM.
COME AGAIN?
SPARKY ISN'T MINE.
I VOLUNTEER AT THE ANIMAL SHELTER,
AND I'M JUST KEEPING HIM FOR THE WEEKEND.
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY, DOUG?
IS THERE ENOUGH ROOM IN YOUR HEART?
DOUG.
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
TAKE IT EASY.
I'M SORRY.
I'M JUST NOT USED TO WAKING UP
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING TO A STRANGE DOG IN OUR BED.
ACTUALLY, IT'S LIKE 1:30 IN THE AFTERNOON, SO...
SERIOUSLY?
WOW.
THEY WEREN'T KIDDING WHEN THEY SAID DON'T MIX WITH ALCOHOL.
YOU FOUND OUT THE HARD WAY.
ANYWAY, THIS IS MY NEW DOG, SPARKY.
I'LL BE BACK IN A LITTLE BIT-
WHOA.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
NOTHING.
I JUST
- I ADOPTED A DOG AT THE
- AT THE BLOCK PARTY.
MOST PEOPLE GO TO A BLOCK PARTY
AND COME BACK WITH A PIE, NOT A DOG.
OK, I DID BRING HOME A PIE.
YOU MISSED IT.
AGAIN, IT'S, LIKE, 1:30 IN THE AFTERNOON.
ALL RIGHT, HONEY, PLEASE, JUST TAKE IT BACK TO WHERE HE CAME FROM, PLEASE.
CARE, COME ON, IT'S BECAUSE OF HIM
THAT THE NEIGHBORS FINALLY LIKE US.
AND WITH ALL THE RUNNING AND-HEH
- PLAYING AROUND WITH HIM,
BONUS.
YOU KNOW WHY?
WASHBOARD.
AH, IT'S GONNA HELP YOU LOSE WEIGHT.
OK.
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU SAID
WHEN YOU TALKED ME INTO GETTING YOU THAT DUNE BUGGY?
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
WHEN I FLIPPED THAT THING
AND I GOT MY JAW WIRED SHUT, I LOST, LIKE, 41/2 POUNDS.
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT, DOUG?
YOU WANT THE DOG, FINE.
IT'S YOURS.
IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.
YOU'RE GONNA FEED HIM.
YOU'RE GONNA WALK HIM, IT'S ALL ON YOU.
ABSOLUTELY.
GONNA FEED HIM RIGHT NOW.
COME ON, LET'S GO FINISH THAT PIE.
DON'T FORGET TO SEPARATE THE WHITES FROM THE COLORS.
YEAH, WELL, HAVIN' A LITTLE TROUBLE
FIGURIN' OUT WHICH ONES ARE THE WHITES.
WATCH THE 'TUDE, JUNKIE.
LOOK, I STILL DON'T GET IT.
I MEAN, HOW IS DOING YOUR LAUNDRY
HELPIN' ME GET OVER MY GAMBLING PROBLEM?
WHEN YOU CAME DOWN HERE,
WHAT DID YOU WANNA DO MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE?
WELL, OPEN A WINDOW.
THEN I WANTED TO CALL MY BOOKIE TO MAKE A COUPLE OF BETS.
I LIKE THE KNICKS, AND THE LAKERS, THEY'RE A LOCK.
AND DID YOU PLACE THOSE BETS?
NO.
AND WHY NOT?
BECAUSE THE DIAL ON YOUR PHONE WAS JAMMED WITH GUM.
NO, BECAUSE I'M KEEPING YOUR STUBBY FINGERS BUSY.
NOW KEEP SORTING.
I'M JUST TELLIN' YOU, GUY, IF YOU DON'T STRETCH NOW,
YOU'RE GONNA FEEL IT TOMORROW.
WHO'S THIS?
OH, IT'S MY NEW DOG, SPARKY.
SPARKY, THIS IS ARTHUR.
WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T SNIFF HIS BUTT.
AH.
JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR,
THE LIVER TREATS IN THE PANTRY ARE MINE.
OH.
IS THIS THE KNICK GAME?
IT WAS.
THEY JUST CRUSHED THE TRAILBLAZERS.
OH.
DID THEY?
AND, UH, WOULD YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW
HOW THE LAKERS FARED?
THEY WON BY, LIKE, 30.
REALLY?
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE'S BACK ON A HOT STREAK.
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.
LET'S GO FIND US SOME BITCHES.
NO, I HAVEN'T DECIDED WHO I'M BETTIN' ON TONIGHT.
HEH.
YES, FAT CHARLIE, I'VE BEEN ON QUITE A HOT STREAK.
SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.
HOLD ON.
HEY, ARTHUR.
HEY!
HOW'S MY FAVORITE RECOVERING ADDICT?
EHH.
HANGIN' IN THERE.
HAVE A SEAT.
LET ME JUST MOVE THESE BOAT CATALOGS.
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT TEAMS
YOUR DISEASED MIND IS OBSESSED WITH TODAY.
WELL, ACTUALLY INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT BASKETBALL
AND, YOU KNOW, SHOCKIN' ME WITH A CAR BATTERY,
I
- I THOUGHT MAYBE WE CAN, I DON'T KNOW,
GET TO THE ROOT OF MY PROBLEM.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WELL, I WAS THINKIN'
THIS WHOLE GAMBLIN' THING MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH MY FATHER NEVER GIVING ME HIS APPROVAL.
OK, LET'S WORK WITH THAT.
GREAT.
GREAT.
NOW, IF YOUR FATHER ASKED YOU WHO TO BET ON TONIGHT,
WHAT TEAM WOULD YOU PICK TO EARN HIS APPROVAL,
THE CELTICS OR THE TIMBERWOLVES?
WHAT?
CELTICS, I GUESS.
AHA.
AND IF HIS LOVE HINGED ON PICKING THE OVER-UNDER...
UNDER.
UNDER!
RIGHTO.
GOD, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I REALLY GOTTA GET A HANDLE ON THIS,
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW, SOMETIMES I JUST FEEL SO DESPERATE
THAT I-I FEEL LIKE GETTIN' UP ON THE ROOF AND-
LET'S PICK THIS UP TOMORROW.
ONE DAY AT A TIME.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
HEY, WHAT'S UP?
I WAS JUST UPSTAIRS,
AND APPARENTLY SOMEBODY PEED IN THE HALLWAY.
YEAH, THAT WAS ME.
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS ISN'T WORKIN' OUT FOR ME.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?
DOUG, YOU TOOK A PERFECTLY GOOD DOG
AND TURNED HIM INTO A BIG, LAZY EATING MACHINE.
AND IN CASE YOU HADN'T NOTICED,
ALREADY GOT ONE OF THOSE.
OH!
SLAMMED ME THERE.
HEH HEH.
COME ON.
SIT DOWN.
WATCH THE TUBE.
EAT SOME DOODLES WITH US.
IT'S FUN.
OK, ALL RIGHT,
NOW, H-HERE'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
OK, YOU'RE GONNA WAKE UP EVERY MORNING EARLY,
AND YOU'RE GONNA WALK HIM,
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA FEED HIM DOG FOOD,
AND THEN IF HE PEES IN THE HOUSE,
YOU'RE GONNA CLEAN IT UP,
AND IF YOU CAN'T DO ALL THOSE THINGS,
HE'S GOIN' RIGHT BACK TO WHERE HE CAME FROM.
I'M GONNA MISS YOU, BUDDY.
COME ON, BOY.
GOTTA TAKE YOU BACK.
BELIEVE ME, IF I COULD TRADE PLACES WITH YOU, I WOULD.
CARRIE, I'M GLAD I CAUGHT YOU.
I WANTED TO DROP OFF THIS DOG TRAINING VIDEO.
IT'S NARRATED BY BETTY WHITE.
OH, RIGHT.
THAT'S GREAT, BUT I'M ACTUALLY NOT GONNA BE NEEDING IT, SO-AHH!
YOU OK?
YEAH, IT'S JUST I GOT A PINCHED NERVE
IN MY NECK.
IT'S KILLIN' ME.
YOU KNOW, I HAD THAT SAME TROUBLE
UNTIL I GOT MY MASSAGE CHAIR.
IT'S CHANGED MY LIFE.
OH, YEAH, I PRICED ONE OF THOSE.
AND UNLESS I'M GOIN' HOME WITH ONE OF THE SALESMEN, AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN.
ACTUALLY, ONE OF MY CLIENTS MANUFACTURES THEM,
SO I CAN GET YOU ONE AT A THIRD OF THE STORE PRICE.
REALLY?
YOU WOULD DO THAT?
AFTER WHAT YOU GUYS DID RESCUING SPARKY,
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.
BLESS YOUR HEARTS.
WELL, DON'T BLESS US.
BLESS ALL OF GOD'S CREATURES.
WELL, I CAN'T TAKE HIM BACK.
WHAT?
WHAT HAPPENED?
GLENN'S GONNA GET ME AN INCREDIBLE DEAL
ON A MASSAGE CHAIR BECAUSE HE THINKS I'M A GOOD PERSON.
I GOTTA KEEP THAT GOIN'.
WELL, HAVE FUN WITH HIM, 'CAUSE I MOVED ON.
I'M THINKIN' ABOUT GETTIN' A BIRD NOW.
WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?
THE DOG WAS YOUR IDEA IN THE FIRST PLACE.
I DON'T WANNA TAKE CARE OF HIM.
SO THINK OF SOMETHING.
WELL?
SORRY.
I'M THINKIN' OF BIRD NAMES.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF CHET?
OK, HOW ABOUT THIS?
WE TAKE HIM TO THE SHELTER,
AND WE TELL PEOPLE THAT HE RAN AWAY.
THAT WAY, WE STILL GET CREDIT FOR THE RESCUE,
PLUS SYMPATHY FOR THE LOSS.
WIN-WIN.
UH-UH.
NO WAY.
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.
GLENN'S DOWN AT THE SHELTER
RESCUING A LLAMA OR WHATEVER EVERY DAY.
WHAT IF WE TAKE HIM OUT OF STATE, LIKE, TO JERSEY?
MMM.
TOO CLOSE.
TOO CLOSE.
PENNSYLVANIA.
AMISH COUNTRY.
ALL RIGHT, BUT IT'S GONNA SUCK FOR HIM, 'CAUSE HE LIKES TV.
HEY, DID YOU PUT UP THE LOST DOG POSTERS?
YEAH.
THEN LOU GAVE ME A HELL OF A SYMPATHY HUG.
I THINK HE SEPARATED MY SHOULDER, SO IT...
WELL, DON'T WORRY.
GLENN SAID OUR MASSAGE CHAIR IS COMIN' TODAY.
OOH.
MAYBE THAT'S IT.
MIRACLES DO HAPPEN.
SPARKY?
HE'S BACK?
IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT,
HE MADE IT ALL THE WAY TO LANCASTER, PENNSYLVANIA.
LUCKY FOR YOU, THEY WERE ABLE TO SCAN HIS MICROCHIP IMPLANT.
MICROCHIP.
WOW.
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE AMISH HAD SCANNERS?
WELL, THE IMPORTANT THING IS HE'S HOME NOW,
AND YOUR FAMILY IS WHOLE.

UNBELIEVABLE.
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU, DAD.
I TOLD YOU THEY WERE BAD PEOPLE.
COME ON, SNOWFLAKE.
DOES HE BELONG TO YOU?
FOUND HIM WANDERING AROUND IN AMISH COUNTRY.
Mudslide kills 600 religious pilgrims, and yet both my ex-wives live on...
Morning.
Morning.
Not again, please not again...
Oh, thank God.
Always in the last place you look, uh?
Have a nice day!
You too.
Yeah Phil, it's Charlie.
Put me down for a grand on Detroit tonight.
What's the lineup?
Well, excuse me...
But don't you think if the gambler is awake it'd be who is the bookie to be up as well?
Alright, well call me when you get off the can.
Are you aware that your sleep-over buddy was packing heat?
Oh yeah...
Any hotter and she'd have burnt my pubes clean off!
Charlie, a gun in a house...
Relax, she's a cop.
Or was a cop...
Or is wanted by the cops.
I know she mentioned cops.
Unbelievable, so this was another one-night stand?
Unless she comes back for her handcuffs, yeah.
Boy, how much satisfaction can you get from that?
Handcuffs?
Never really my thing.
But hey, she probably did some stuff last night that might not have been her first choice...
No, I mean how can you possibly get any satisfaction from an endless series of alcohol-soaked one night stands, and even as the words are coming out of my mouth
I realize this is a stupid question so forget I said it.
She's married to a cop!
I hate to see you wasting your life, having drunken sex with women you don't care about.
Who asked you to move back in and watch?
- You know who's good for you?
- Don't go there Alan.
Mia.
She was beautiful, she was smart, she got you to clean up your act.
I'm telling you Charlie, letting her go was the stupidest thing you've ever done.
You're going there Alan...
I'm just saying you had this fantastic woman who was willing to marry you, and then you just threw it away, and for what?
OK, you're there!
You want to know why I gave up Mia?
I'll tell you why I gave up Mia,
- I gave her up for you.
- Oh oh, for me?
Yeah, yeah, for you!
She wanted you to move out so we would have the house to ourselves, but I said "nooo way, I am not throwing my brother out on the street".
- What a loving gesture.
- Oh bite me!
And you know what you did?
You married Kandi and moved out anyway.
So if you want to know why I let the best thing that ever happened to me get away, it's so the worst thing that could ever happen to me would have a place to live.
I guessed it all worked out for the best, huh?
How do you figure?
Think about it:
if Mia had been living here when Kandi kicked me out and I came back, it would have been a very awkward situation.
Charlie?
Oh... yeah, awkward..

Porkepick Corrections:
Bouliii
Phil...
Phil, you're my bookie, not my psychiatrist.
If I want to bet every single game in the country with money I don't have, that's my business.
Thank you, now... let's talk boxing.
Really?
There's no fights anywhere tonight?
OK, well...
how are you and your wife getting along?
What, it'd be a fair fight, she's got like 50 pounds on you!
Hello...
My luck, I gotta have a bookie who is afraid to fight out of his weight class.
Aren't you a little worried that all this betting might be turning into a problem?
Alan, if you don't bet big you can't cover your losses.
And if you can't cover your losses, a large man with a tire iron puts your address in the map-quest, at which point you have to sneak across the Mexican border dressed in woman's clothing.
Now that's when you have a problem.
You know best.
You're hungry?
I made your favorite sandwich.
Turkey, ham and pastrami.
Gobble, oink, mooooo.
No, thanks.
OK, how about something sweet?
Key lime pie, yummy yummy!
Look, Alan, I appreciate your sucking up.
But you can't fill the gaping wound in my heart with...
Deli meat.
And pie.
Yummy.
Can we just leave it alone?
Can we not grind on and on about the stupidest thing I've ever done?
OK, I'm sorry I said that, giving up Mia was not the stupidest thing you've ever done.
It certainly wasn't as stupid as when you came back from Rio with that gorgeous model, you know, the one with the Adam's apple and the really big hands?
You know, I'm gonna give you some space.
Maybe go for a nice drive...
Forgot my keys...
You know what, they must have slipped out of my pocket, and... into the couch.
Excuse me.
Sorry...
Found some change!
Look...
Is that a quarter in your ear?
Very impressive...
What is that?
Steven Tyler rented the house next door.
The guy from Aerosmith?
I lost my virginity to him.
You know, his music.
Thanks, I was confused...
He's apparently getting ready for a tour.
So what's... in the box?
I went out and picked you up a little something I thought might put a smile on your face.
Alan, the only thing in this box that could possibly put a smiling on my face, is your severed head.
Good one.
Zing!
Come on, open it!
- A hat!
?
- A very expensive hat.
Since when do I wear hats?
Well, you don't but I saw it and it seemed so... you.
You know, cool, rakish... yet forgiving.
- OK fine, I forgive you.
- Thanks!
Thanks...
Aren't you gonna try it on?
No.
If you really forgave me, you'd try it on.
Oh yeah!
That is you.
Let's try tilting it a little bit here.
Oh baby!
You gotta see this, come on inside, we'll take a look.
Charlie, you're coming?
What's going on?
You should leave, Alan.
Why?
Just trust me.
Alright.
Hey Tyler, take a pause for the cause!
Oh sorry man...
Thank you and goodnight!
Hi Charlie.
Rose.
How cool is it that Steven Tyler moved in next door?
I lost my virginity to him.
You mean his music?
No.
Nice hat.
Thanks.
Boy, you look like hell.
That's strange.
'Cause I feel like crap.
How long do you think you can keep it up?
What exactly are we talking about?
The excessive drinking, the obsessive partying, the compulsive gambling.
Hard to say.
Trying to take it one day at a time.
You do realize this is all just an attempt to avoid feeling your feelings?
Let me tell you something about feelings.
Feelings are like your mother's breasts.
You know where they are, but they're best left unfelt.
It's an interesting analogy but may I point out that the mother's breasts are a source of nourishment and comfort.
Yeah, well my mother's breasts were a source of silicone and Russian vodka.
Not good for child wearing, but she was a big hit at parties.
Charlie, I know how much it hurt you to give up Mia, and I know you don't like that feeling, but the more you try to get rid of it, the more it's going to come back.
Oh yeah...
Perfect fit.
It's like somebody measured your head while you were asleep, so when your brother called, she could tell him the size.
Hey Uncle Charlie, guess where I'm finally growing hair?
Come on man, I'm eating.
Right here, I'm growing a 'stache.
Oh yeah, look at that...
Hey, cool hat!
Whose is it?
Yours.
- Really?
- Yeah.
It looks great with the 'stache.
You know, it just occurred to me that I've been feeling guilty because you called off your wedding to Mia so I wouldn't have to move out.
But then, when I did move out, you didn't call her!
Yeah, so?
So, you know why I think you didn't call her?
You didn't call her because the whole
"I don't want to throw my brother out on the street" business, is was a very convenient and noble excuse to get out of the marriage.
That's what you think, huh?
- Yes, that's what I think.
- That's what you think?
You heard me, that's what I think!
Yeah, well... think again.
Admit it Charlie, I've been beating myself up buying you pie and hats for nothing.
There's pie?
There was, Berta ate it.
And why is he wearing your hat?
I gave it to him.
I bought this hat for you.
And I gave it to Jake.
You can't commit to anything, can you?
- It's just a hat!
- It's not just a hat, it's a symbol!
- Of what?
!
- Of...
OK, it's just a hat.
But... the point is, you have nobody to blame for your miserable lonely existence but yourself!
And you can drink, gamble and hump all you want, but one day, you're gonna have to face that fact.
Drink, gamble and hump!
Yeah well, I don't have to face anything I don't want to face, and I don't have to feel anything I don't want to feel, and that includes Mom's vodka knockers.
Who is this Vod Kanockers that you speak of?
Eat your dinner.
The name's Kanockers.
Vod Kanockers.
Charlie?
Are you OK?
Just dandy...
Could you close the blinds?
Come on, let's get you inside...
Looks like you had a tough night!
No, the night was great.
It's the morning that's killing me.
Hey Alan...
What?
You were right.
I can't keep running away from my feelings...
I'm glad you realized that.
You're a wonderful brother, and this is a beautiful hat.
Thank you.
Charlie, you're OK?
I'm fine.
The hat's not so good.
Hey, Berta, want to see my armpit hair?
Only if you want to see mine...
- Hey.
- Hey.
You know that's my juice...
I know.
You could at least ask...
You could at least pay a rent.
Touchй...
If that's a bookie or a woman you know what to say.
Harper residence.
Sorry, he's dead.
Interesting.
No one ever calls back to find out where to send flowers.
Touchй...
How does it feel to go a whole week without booze, broads or betting?
It's actually kind of a relief...
I never realized how much effort it took to avoid feeling anything.
Yeah?
What are you feeling now?
So far, mostly nausea and boredom.
Touchй...
You don't know what that means, do you?
Not a clue.
Hey, if girls with big boobs work at Hooters, where do girls with only one leg work at?
IHOP!
That's just cruel.
Actually, it's kinda funny.
Yeah!
'Cause they got one leg, they have to hop!
I hop!
Tipping your waitress takes on a whole new meaning.
It's not that funny.
I know.
Why are you laughing so much?
I don't know!
Dad!
?
Something's wrong with Uncle Charlie!
What's going on?
Hey Jake, tell your Dad, how one legged girls work at IHOP.
Oh no.
I gave away the joke.
I'm so sorry Jake.
I've ruined everything...
Is he OK?
He's fine, his feelings are coming at the surface.
Oh, like when Mom gets PMS.
Well, kinda...
Hang on, Uncle Charlie, I'll get you some chocolate.
What's he making out there?
A lanyard...
He's got a lot of free time now, so I gave him one of Jake's old hobby-kits.
You know, so he'd have something to do...
I'm surprised he's not making a vagina out of macaroni and bottle caps.
Around, around the block, and then downtown...
Over, over, loop, around, around the block, and then...
Yo dude!
Some of us are trying to do crafts here!
What!
?
Can you lay off the harmonica playing?
Hey, a lot of people pay to see me play harmonica.
They pay to hear you sing, they tolerate the harmonica!
Sorry I don't measure up to your musical standards, you... lame-ass jingle writer!
Alright, let's see how you play harmonica your other end!
No no no no, slow down here!
Come on...
Let's see what you got, jingle balls!
OK, I'm gonna rip off your big fat lips, and use them to kiss my ass!
Charlie!
Please, please...
You know your emotions are a little bit frayed right now...
Right!
Right, OK...
OK.
I'm better.
That's it!
No, Charlie, Charlie!
Wait!
Charlie, don't do this!
Come on Tyler, you want a piece of me?
!
Well the dude may look like a lady, but you fight like a little girl.
Did it ever occur to you to help me out?
Yeah, but once you were cowering under his picnic table I figured the worst was over.
Oh, good thinking squirting that bottle of sunblock at him.
I was hoping it would get in his eyes and blind him.
Yeah well, all you did was keep him from getting a nasty burn while he beat the crap out of you.
Please Alan, I'm begging you...
OK.
It's not right to kick a man when he's down.
Thanks.
Too bad Steven Tyler didn't feel that way, huh?
You were right about Mia,
I got cold feet, so I used you as an excuse to call off the wedding.
I am so proud of you Charlie, this is a real breakthrough.
Doesn't it feel liberating to finally hear yourself admit the truth?
Well I feel something...
But since I'm also hearing a high pitch whistle, it might just be a concussion.
What are you making?
A needlepoint sampler.
No kidding?
I find it very calming.
And the message helps centering.
God bless Vicoden?
Pretty good, huh?
You spelled Vicodin wrong.
That's the great thing about Vicodin,
I don't care.
Hey, is Charlie here?
Huh...
Who may I say is calling?
It's OK, Alan.
- Hey Chazz, thanks for the gift.
- You're welcome.
So no hard feelings?
Nah...
You?
Why would I have hard feelings,
I'm still picking pieces of your ass out of my boot.
Good one!
OK well, good luck with the Tour.
Thanks a lot man.
Who is the sponsor?
Metamucil?
What was that?
Nothing, nothing...
I just want to say,
I'm a huge fan.
I lost my virginity to you.
Really ?
Well, you know, there's... a lot of the seventies I don't remember.
Isn't that the hat I got you?
Yeah.
The hat you threw up in?
I had it cleaned, but...
I'll always know...
"Mudslide kills 600 religious pilgrims."
And yet both my ex-wives live on.
Ahem.
Morning.
- Morning.
- Uh-oh.
Tsk.
Not again.
Please, not again.
Ugh.
Thank God.
Always in the last place you look, huh?
Uh-huh.
Have a nice day.
You too.
Phil, it's Charlie.
Put me down for a grand on Detroit tonight.
What's the line now?
Well, excuse me.
Don't you think if the gambler is awake, it behooves the bookie to be up as well?
All right, well, call me when you get off the can.
Are you aware that your sleepover buddy was packing heat?
Oh, yeah.
Any hotter and she'd have burned my pubes clean off.
Charlie, a gun in the house?
Relax, she's a cop.
Or was a cop.
Or is wanted by the cops.
I know she mentioned cops.
Unbelievable.
So this was another one-night stand?
Unless she comes back for her handcuffs, yeah.
Boy, how much satisfaction can you get from that?
Handcuffs?
Not really my thing.
But she probably did some stuff that might not have been her first choice.
No, I mean, how can you possibly get any satisfaction from an endless series of one-night stands?
As the words come out, I realize it's a stupid question.
Forget I said it.
She's married to a cop.
I hate to see you wasting your life having drunken sex with women you don't care about.
Well, who asked you to move back in and watch?
- You know who was good for you?
- Don't go there, Alan.
Mia.
She was beautiful, she was smart, she got you to clean up your act.
I'm telling you, letting her go was the stupidest thing you've ever done.
You're going there, Alan.
Just saying, you had this fantastic woman who was willing to marry you and you just threw it away, and for what?
Okay, you're there.

Not really my thing.
But she probably did some stuff that might not have been her first choice.
No, I mean, how can you possibly get any satisfaction from an endless series of one-night stands?
As the words come out, I realize it's a stupid question.
Forget I said it.
She's married to a cop.
I hate to see you wasting your life having drunken sex with women you don't care about.
Well, who asked you to move back in and watch?
- You know who was good for you?
- Don't go there, Alan.
Mia.
She was beautiful, she was smart, she got you to clean up your act.
I'm telling you, letting her go was the stupidest thing you've ever done.
You're going there, Alan.
Just saying, you had this fantastic woman who was willing to marry you...
You wanna know why I gave up Mia?
I'll tell you why I gave up Mia.
- I gave her up for you.
- Oh, for me?
Yeah, yeah, for you.
She wanted you to move out so we'd have the house to ourselves, but I said, "No way.
I am not throwing my brother out on the street."
Wow.
- What a loving gesture.
- Oh, bite me.
And you know what you did?
You married Kandi and moved out anyway.
You wanna know why I let the best thing that ever happened to me get away?
So the worst thing that could ever happen to me would have a place to live.
Oh.
"Oh."
Well, I guess it all worked out for the best, huh?
- How do you figure?
- Well, think about it.
If Mia had been living here when Kandi kicked me out and I came back, heh it would've been a very awkward situation.
Oh!
Aah!
- Charlie?
- Huh?
Oh, yeah.
Awkward.
Phil, Phil, Phil, you're my bookie, not my psychiatrist.
If I wanna bet every game in the country with money I don't have that's my business.
Thank you.
Now let's talk boxing.
Really?
There's no fights anywhere tonight?
Okay, well, how are you and your wife getting along?
What?
It would be a fair fight.
She's got like 50 pounds on you.
Hello?
My luck.
I gotta have a bookie who's afraid to fight out of his weight class.
Aren't you worried that this betting might be turning into a problem?
Alan, if you don't bet big, you can't cover your losses.
And if you can't cover your losses a large man with a tire iron puts your address into MapQuest.
You have to sneak across the Mexican border dressed in women's clothing.
- Now, that's when you have a problem.
- Well, you know best.
You hungry?
I- I made your favorite sandwich.
Turkey, ham and pastrami.
Heh, gooble.
No, thanks.
Okay, how about something sweet?
Key-lime pie.
Yummy, yummy.
Look, Alan, I appreciate your sucking up but you can't fill the gaping wound in my heart with deli meat.
And pie.
Yummy.
Can't we just leave it alone?
Can we not grind on and on about the stupidest thing I've ever done?
Okay, okay, I'm sorry I said that.
Giving up Mia was not the stupidest thing you've ever done.
It wasn't as stupid as when you came back from Rio with that model.
You know, the one with the Adam's apple and the really big hands.
You know, I'm gonna give you some space.
Maybe go for a nice drive.
Forgot my keys.
Ahh...
Oh.
Huh.
You know, they must have slipped out of my pocket and into the couch.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Found some change.
Ha-ha.
Oh, look, look.
Is that a quarter in your ear?
Ta-da.
Very impressive.
Aaah!
Yeah!
Bab-em-stab-em-bab-em-bay-uh-dye
- What is that?
- Steven Tyler rented the house next door.
The
- The guy from Aerosmith?
I lost my virginity to him.
Well, you know, his music.
Thanks, I was confused.
He's apparently getting ready for a tour.
So, what's-?
in the box?
I went out and picked you up something I thought might put a smile on your face.
Alan, the only thing in this box that could possibly put a smile on my face is your severed head.
Good one.
Zing!
Go on, open it.
- A hat?
- A very expensive hat.
Since when do I wear hats?
Well, you don't, but I saw it and it seemed so you.
You know, cool, rakish, yet forgiving.
- Okay, fine, I forgive you.
- Oh, thanks.
Thanks.
- Aren't you gonna try it on?
- No.
If you really forgave me, you'd try it on.
Oh, yeah.
That is you.
Let's
- Let's try tilting it a little bit here.
Oh, baby.
Ha-ha.
You gotta see this.
Come on inside.
We'll take a look.
Charlie, you coming?
- What's going on?
- You should leave, Alan.
- Why?
- Just trust me.
All right.
Hey, Tyler, take a pause for the cause.
Oh, sorry, man.
Thank you and good night.
- Hi, Charlie.
- Rose.
How cool is it that Steven Tyler moved in next door?
I lost my virginity to him.
- You mean his music.
- No.
- Nice hat.
- Thanks.
Boy, you look like hell.
Well, that's strange, because I feel like crap.
How long do you think you can keep it up?
What exactly are we talking about?
The excessive drinking, the obsessive partying the compulsive gambling.
Oh.
Hard to say.
I try and take it one day at a time.
You do realize this is all just an attempt to avoid feeling your feelings.
Let me tell you something about feelings.
Feelings are like your mother's breasts.
You know where they are, but they're best left unfelt.
Interesting analogy.
May I point out that a mother's breasts are a source of nourishment and comfort?
Yeah, well, my mother's breasts were a source of silicone and Russian vodka.
Not good for child-rearing, but she was a big hit at parties.
Charlie, I know how much it hurt you to give up Mia.
And I know you don't like that feeling, but the more you try to get rid of it the more it's going to come back.
Oh, yeah.
Perfect fit, like somebody measured your head while you were asleep so when your brother called, she could tell him the size.
Hey, Uncle Charlie, guess where I'm finally growing hair.
Come on, man, I'm eating.
Right here.
I'm growing a 'stache.
Oh, yeah, look at that.
Hey, cool hat.
Whose is it?
Yours.
- Really?
- Yeah.
It looks great with the 'stache.
It just occurred to me that I've been feeling guilty because you called off your wedding so I wouldn't move out.
But then when I did move out, you didn't call her.
Yeah?
So?
So you know why I think you didn't call her?
You didn't call because the "I don't wanna throw my brother out" business was a convenient excuse to get out of the marriage.
- That's what you think?
- Yes, that's what I think.
- That's what you think?
- You heard me.
- That's what I think.
- Yeah, well, think again.
Admit it, I've been beating myself up, buying you pie and hats, for nothing.
There's pie?
There was.
Berta ate it.
And why is he wearing your hat?
- I gave it to him.
- I bought this hat for you.
- And I gave it to Jake.
- You can't commit to anything, can you?
- It's just a hat.
- It's not just a hat, it's a symbol.
- Of what?
- Of...
Okay, it's just a hat.
But the point is you have nobody to blame for your miserable existence but yourself.
Drink, gamble and hump all you want.
One day you're gonna have to face that fact.
Drink, gamble and hump.
Yeah, well, I don't have to face anything I don't wanna face.
And I don't have to feel anything I don't wanna feel.
That includes Mom's vodka knockers.
Who is this Vod Kanockers that you speak of?
Eat your dinner.
The name's Kanockers, Vod Kanockers.
- Charlie?
- Shh.
- You okay?
- Just dandy.
Would you close the blinds?
Come on.
Let's get you inside.
- It looks like you had a tough night.
- No, the night was great.
It's the morning that's killing me.
- Hey, Alan?
- What?
You were right.
I can't keep running away from my feelings.
- Well, I'm glad you realize that.
- You're a wonderful brother.
And this is a beautiful hat.
Thank you.
- Charlie, are you okay?
- I'm fine.
The hat's not so good.
Hey, Berta, wanna see my armpit hair?
Only if you wanna see mine.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You know that's my juice.
- I know.
- You could at least ask.
- You could at least pay rent.
Touché.
If that's a bookie or a woman, you know what to say.
Harper residence.
Sorry, he's dead.
Interesting.
No one ever calls back to find out where to send flowers.
Touché.
How's it feel to go a whole week without booze, broads or betting?
It's actually kind of a relief.
I never realized how much effort it took to avoid feeling anything.
- Yeah?
What are you feeling now?
- So far, mostly nausea and boredom.
Touché.
- You don't know what that means?
- Not a clue.
Hey, if girls with big boobs work at Hooters where do girls with only one leg work at?
IHOP.
That's just cruel.
Actually, it's kind of funny.
Yeah, because they got one leg.
They have to hop.
Right, IHOP.
Tipping your waitress takes on a whole new meaning.
- It's not that funny.
- I know.
- Then why are you laughing so much?
- I don't know.
Dad, something's wrong with Uncle Charlie.
What's going on?
Hey, Jake, tell your dad how one-legged girls work at IHOP.
Oh, no.
I gave away the joke.
I'm so sorry, Jake.
I've ruined everything.
Is he okay?
He's fine.
His feelings are coming to the surface.
Oh, like when Mom gets PMS.
Well, kind of.
Hang on, Uncle Charlie, I'll get you some chocolate.
- What's he making out there?
- A lanyard.
He's got a lot of free time now so I gave him one of Jake's old hobby kits.
You know, so he'd have something to do.
I'm surprised he's not making a vagina out of macaroni and bottle caps.
Over, loop around around the block and then downtown.
Over, over, loop around around the block and then-
Yo, dude, some of us are trying to do crafts here.
- What?
- Can you lay off the harmonica playing?
Hey, a lot of people pay to see me play harmonica.
They pay to hear you sing.
They tolerate the harmonica.
Sorry I don't measure up to your musical standards you lame-ass jingle writer.
Let's see how you play harmonica out your other end.
No, no, no, let's slow down here.
Come on.
Let's see what you got, jingle balls.
I'm gonna rip off your big lips and use them to kiss my ass.
Charlie, please, you know your emotions are a little bit frayed now.
Right, right, okay.
Okay.
I'm better.
- That's it.
- No, Charlie.
Charlie, wait.
Charlie, don't do this.
Come on, Tyler.
You want a piece of me?
Well, the dude may look like a lady, but you fight like a little girl.
Did it ever occur to you to help me out?
Yeah, but once you were cowering under his picnic table I figured the worst was over.
Though quick thinking, squirting that bottle of sun block at him.
I was hoping it would get in his eyes and blind him.
All you did was keep him from getting a burn while he beat the crap out of you.
Please, Alan, I'm begging you.
Okay.
It's not right to kick a man when he's down.
Thanks.
Too bad Steven Tyler didn't feel that way, huh?
Heh.
You were right about Mia.
I got cold feet, so I used you as an excuse to call off the wedding.
I am so proud of you, Charlie.
This is a real breakthrough.
And doesn't it feel liberating to finally hear yourself admit the truth?
Well, I feel something.
But since I'm also hearing a high-pitched whistle it might just be a concussion.
- What are you making?
- A needlepoint sampler.
- No kidding.
- I find it very calming.
And the message helps center me.
- "God bless Vicodin"?
- Mm-hm.
- Pretty good, huh?
- You spelled "Vicodin" wrong.
That's the great thing about Vicodin.
I don't care.
Hey, is Charlie here?
Uh...
Who may I say is calling?
It's okay, Alan.
- Hey, Chazz, thanks for the gift.
- You're welcome.
- So no hard feelings?
- No.
You?
Why would I have hard feelings?
I'm still picking pieces of your ass out of my boot.
Good one.
- Okay, well, good luck with the tour.
- Thanks a lot, man.
Who's the sponsor?
Metamucil?
- What was that?
- Nothing, nothing.
I just wanna say I'm a huge fan.
- I lost my virginity to you.
Heh-heh.
- Really?
Well, you know, there's a lot of the '70s I don't remember.
- Isn't that the hat I got you?
- Yeah.
The hat you threw up in?
I had it cleaned.
But I'll always know.
"Mudslide kills 600 religious pilgrims. "
And yet both my ex-wives live on.
Ahem.
Morning.
- Morning.
- Uh-oh.
Tsk.
Not again.
Please, not again.
Ugh.
Thank God.
Always in the last place you look, huh?
Uh-huh.
Have a nice day.
You too.
Phil, it's Charlie.
Put me down for a grand on Detroit tonight.
What's the line now?
Well, excuse me.
But don't you think if the gambler is awake, it behooves the bookie to be up as well?
All right, well, call me when you get off the can.
Are you aware that your sleepover buddy was packing heat?
Oh, yeah.
Any hotter and she'd have burned my pubes clean off.
Charlie, a gun in the house?
Relax, she's a cop.
Or was a cop.
Or is wanted by the cops.
I know she mentioned cops.
Unbelievable.
So this was another one-night stand?
Unless she comes back for her handcuffs, yeah.
Boy, how much satisfaction can you get from that?
Handcuffs?
Not really my thing.
But she probably did some stuff that might not have been her first choice.
No, I mean, how can you possibly get any satisfaction from an endless series of one-night stands?
As the words come out, I realize it's a stupid question.
Forget I said it.
She's married to a cop.

You're going there, Alan.
Just saying, you had this fantastic woman who was willing to marry you and you just threw it away, and for what?
Okay, you're there.
You wanna know why I gave up Mia?
I'll tell you why I gave up Mia.
- I gave her up for you.
- Oh, for me?
Yeah, yeah, for you.
She wanted you to move out so we'd have the house to ourselves, but I said, "No way.

Mudslide kills 600 religious pilgrims, and yet both my ex-wives live on...
Morning.
Morning.
Not again, please not again...
Oh, thank God.
Always in the last place you look, uh?
Have a nice day!
You too.
Yeah Phil, it's Charlie.
Put me down for a grand on Detroit tonight.
What's the lineup?
Well, excuse me...
But don't you think if the gambler is awake it'd be who is the bookie to be up as well?
Alright, well call me when you get off the can.
Are you aware that your sleep-over buddy was packing heat?
Oh yeah...
Any hotter and she'd have burnt my pubes clean off!
Charlie, a gun in a house...
Relax, she's a cop.
Or was a cop...
Or is wanted by the cops.
I know she mentioned cops.
Unbelievable, so this was another one-night stand?
Unless she comes back for her handcuffs, yeah.
Boy, how much satisfaction can you get from that?
Handcuffs?
Never really my thing.
But hey, she probably did some stuff last night that might not have been her first choice...
No, I mean how can you possibly get any satisfaction from an endless series of alcohol-soaked one night stands, and even as the words are coming out of my mouth
I realize this is a stupid question so forget I said it.
She's married to a cop!
I hate to see you wasting your life, having drunken sex with women you don't care about.
Who asked you to move back in and watch?
- You know who's good for you?
- Don't go there Alan.
Mia.
She was beautiful, she was smart, she got you to clean up your act.
I'm telling you Charlie, letting her go was the stupidest thing you've ever done.
You're going there Alan...
I'm just saying you had this fantastic woman who was willing to marry you, and then you just threw it away, and for what?
OK, you're there!
You want to know why I gave up Mia?
I'll tell you why I gave up Mia,
- I gave her up for you.
- Oh oh, for me?
Yeah, yeah, for you!
She wanted you to move out so we would have the house to ourselves, but I said "nooo way, I am not throwing my brother out on the street".
- What a loving gesture.
- Oh bite me!
And you know what you did?
You married Kandi and moved out anyway.
So if you want to know why I let the best thing that ever happened to me get away, it's so the worst thing that could ever happen to me would have a place to live.
I guessed it all worked out for the best, huh?
How do you figure?
Think about it:
if Mia had been living here when Kandi kicked me out and I came back, it would have been a very awkward situation.
Charlie?
Oh... yeah, awkward..

Phil...
Phil, you're my bookie, not my psychiatrist.
If I want to bet every single game in the country with money I don't have, that's my business.
Thank you, now... let's talk boxing.
Really?
There's no fights anywhere tonight?
OK, well...
how are you and your wife getting along?
What, it'd be a fair fight, she's got like 50 pounds on you!
Hello...
My luck, I gotta have a bookie who is afraid to fight out of his weight class.
Aren't you a little worried that all this betting might be turning into a problem?
Alan, if you don't bet big you can't cover your losses.
And if you can't cover your losses, a large man with a tire iron puts your address in the map-quest, at which point you have to sneak across the Mexican border dressed in woman's clothing.
Now that's when you have a problem.
You know best.
You're hungry?
I made your favorite sandwich.
Turkey, ham and pastrami.
Gobble, oink, mooooo.
No, thanks.
OK, how about something sweet?
Key lime pie, yummy yummy!
Look, Alan, I appreciate your sucking up.
But you can't fill the gaping wound in my heart with...
Deli meat.
And pie.
Yummy.
Can we just leave it alone?
Can we not grind on and on about the stupidest thing I've ever done?
OK, I'm sorry I said that, giving up Mia was not the stupidest thing you've ever done.
It certainly wasn't as stupid as when you came back from Rio with that gorgeous model, you know, the one with the Adam's apple and the really big hands?
You know, I'm gonna give you some space.
Maybe go for a nice drive...
Forgot my keys...
You know what, they must have slipped out of my pocket, and... into the couch.
Excuse me.
Sorry...
Found some change!
Look...
Is that a quarter in your ear?
Very impressive...
What is that?
Steven Tyler rented the house next door.
The guy from Aerosmith?
I lost my virginity to him.
You know, his music.
Thanks, I was confused...
He's apparently getting ready for a tour.
So what's... in the box?
I went out and picked you up a little something I thought might put a smile on your face.
Alan, the only thing in this box that could possibly put a smiling on my face, is your severed head.
Good one.
Zing!
Come on, open it!
- A hat!
?
- A very expensive hat.
Since when do I wear hats?
Well, you don't but I saw it and it seemed so... you.
You know, cool, rakish... yet forgiving.
- OK fine, I forgive you.
- Thanks!
Thanks...
Aren't you gonna try it on?
No.
If you really forgave me, you'd try it on.
Oh yeah!
That is you.
Let's try tilting it a little bit here.
Oh baby!
You gotta see this, come on inside, we'll take a look.
Charlie, you're coming?
What's going on?
You should leave, Alan.
Why?
Just trust me.
Alright.
Hey Tyler, take a pause for the cause!
Oh sorry man...
Thank you and goodnight!
Hi Charlie.
Rose.
How cool is it that Steven Tyler moved in next door?
I lost my virginity to him.
You mean his music?
No.
Nice hat.
Thanks.
Boy, you look like hell.
That's strange.
'Cause I feel like crap.
How long do you think you can keep it up?
What exactly are we talking about?
The excessive drinking, the obsessive partying, the compulsive gambling.
Hard to say.
Trying to take it one day at a time.
You do realize this is all just an attempt to avoid feeling your feelings?
Let me tell you something about feelings.
Feelings are like your mother's breasts.
You know where they are, but they're best left unfelt.
It's an interesting analogy but may I point out that the mother's breasts are a source of nourishment and comfort.
Yeah, well my mother's breasts were a source of silicone and Russian vodka.
Not good for child wearing, but she was a big hit at parties.
Charlie, I know how much it hurt you to give up Mia, and I know you don't like that feeling, but the more you try to get rid of it, the more it's going to come back.
Oh yeah...
Perfect fit.
It's like somebody measured your head while you were asleep, so when your brother called, she could tell him the size.
Hey Uncle Charlie, guess where I'm finally growing hair?
Come on man, I'm eating.
Right here, I'm growing a 'stache.
Oh yeah, look at that...
Hey, cool hat!
Whose is it?
Yours.
- Really?
- Yeah.
It looks great with the 'stache.
You know, it just occurred to me that I've been feeling guilty because you called off your wedding to Mia so I wouldn't have to move out.
But then, when I did move out, you didn't call her!
Yeah, so?
So, you know why I think you didn't call her?
You didn't call her because the whole
"I don't want to throw my brother out on the street" business, is was a very convenient and noble excuse to get out of the marriage.
That's what you think, huh?
- Yes, that's what I think.
- That's what you think?
You heard me, that's what I think!
Yeah, well... think again.
Admit it Charlie, I've been beating myself up buying you pie and hats for nothing.
There's pie?
There was, Berta ate it.
And why is he wearing your hat?
I gave it to him.
I bought this hat for you.
And I gave it to Jake.
You can't commit to anything, can you?
- It's just a hat!
- It's not just a hat, it's a symbol!
- Of what?
!
- Of...
OK, it's just a hat.
But... the point is, you have nobody to blame for your miserable lonely existence but yourself!
And you can drink, gamble and hump all you want, but one day, you're gonna have to face that fact.
Drink, gamble and hump!
Yeah well, I don't have to face anything I don't want to face, and I don't have to feel anything I don't want to feel, and that includes Mom's vodka knockers.
Who is this Vod Kanockers that you speak of?
Eat your dinner.
The name's Kanockers.
Vod Kanockers.
Charlie?
Are you OK?
Just dandy...
Could you close the blinds?
Come on, let's get you inside...
Looks like you had a tough night!
No, the night was great.
It's the morning that's killing me.
Hey Alan...
What?
You were right.
I can't keep running away from my feelings...
I'm glad you realized that.
You're a wonderful brother, and this is a beautiful hat.
Thank you.
Charlie, you're OK?
I'm fine.
The hat's not so good.
Hey, Berta, want to see my armpit hair?
Only if you want to see mine...
- Hey.
- Hey.
You know that's my juice...
I know.
You could at least ask...
You could at least pay a rent.
Touché...
If that's a bookie or a woman you know what to say.
Harper residence.
Sorry, he's dead.
Interesting.
No one ever calls back to find out where to send flowers.
Touché...
How does it feel to go a whole week without booze, broads or betting?
It's actually kind of a relief...
I never realized how much effort it took to avoid feeling anything.
Yeah?
What are you feeling now?
So far, mostly nausea and boredom.
Touché...
You don't know what that means, do you?
Not a clue.
Hey, if girls with big boobs work at Hooters, where do girls with only one leg work at?
IHOP!
That's just cruel.
Actually, it's kinda funny.
Yeah!
'Cause they got one leg, they have to hop!
I hop!
Tipping your waitress takes on a whole new meaning.
It's not that funny.
I know.
Why are you laughing so much?
I don't know!
Dad!
?
Something's wrong with Uncle Charlie!
What's going on?
Hey Jake, tell your Dad, how one legged girls work at IHOP.
Oh no.
I gave away the joke.
I'm so sorry Jake.
I've ruined everything...
Is he OK?
He's fine, his feelings are coming at the surface.
Oh, like when Mom gets PMS.
Well, kinda...
Hang on, Uncle Charlie, I'll get you some chocolate.
What's he making out there?
A lanyard...
He's got a lot of free time now, so I gave him one of Jake's old hobby-kits.
You know, so he'd have something to do...
I'm surprised he's not making a vagina out of macaroni and bottle caps.
Around, around the block, and then downtown...
Over, over, loop, around, around the block, and then...
Yo dude!
Some of us are trying to do crafts here!
What!
?
Can you lay off the harmonica playing?
Hey, a lot of people pay to see me play harmonica.
They pay to hear you sing, they tolerate the harmonica!
Sorry I don't measure up to your musical standards, you... lame-ass jingle writer!
Alright, let's see how you play harmonica your other end!
No no no no, slow down here!
Come on...
Let's see what you got, jingle balls!
OK, I'm gonna rip off your big fat lips, and use them to kiss my ass!
Charlie!
Please, please...
You know your emotions are a little bit frayed right now...
Right!
Right, OK...
OK.
I'm better.
That's it!
No, Charlie, Charlie!
Wait!
Charlie, don't do this!
Come on Tyler, you want a piece of me?
!
Well the dude may look like a lady, but you fight like a little girl.
Did it ever occur to you to help me out?
Yeah, but once you were cowering under his picnic table I figured the worst was over.
Oh, good thinking squirting that bottle of sunblock at him.
I was hoping it would get in his eyes and blind him.
Yeah well, all you did was keep him from getting a nasty burn while he beat the crap out of you.
Please Alan, I'm begging you...
OK.
It's not right to kick a man when he's down.
Thanks.
Too bad Steven Tyler didn't feel that way, huh?
You were right about Mia,
I got cold feet, so I used you as an excuse to call off the wedding.
I am so proud of you Charlie, this is a real breakthrough.
Doesn't it feel liberating to finally hear yourself admit the truth?
Well I feel something...
But since I'm also hearing a high pitch whistle, it might just be a concussion.
What are you making?
A needlepoint sampler.
No kidding?
I find it very calming.
And the message helps centering.
God bless Vicoden?
Pretty good, huh?
You spelled Vicodin wrong.
That's the great thing about Vicodin,
I don't care.
Hey, is Charlie here?
Huh...
Who may I say is calling?
It's OK, Alan.
- Hey Chazz, thanks for the gift.
- You're welcome.
So no hard feelings?
Nah...
You?
Why would I have hard feelings,
I'm still picking pieces of your ass out of my boot.
Good one!
OK well, good luck with the Tour.
Thanks a lot man.
Who is the sponsor?
Metamucil?
What was that?
Nothing, nothing...
I just want to say,
I'm a huge fan.
I lost my virginity to you.
Really ?
Well, you know, there's... a lot of the seventies I don't remember.
Isn't that the hat I got you?
Yeah.
The hat you threw up in?
I had it cleaned, but...
I'll always know...
Mudslide kills 600 religious pilgrims, and yet both my ex-wives live on...

And...
You roared so loud, his spots flew clean off.
Dad, I've heard this like a billion times.
Do you know the one where I made the laughing hyenas...
Cry?
Yep.
- The croc attack?
- Dad.
OK.
Think.
Yeah, you do that.
All right, Mr. Smart Guy, here's one I know you haven't heard.
It all started in the little place I like to call the wild.
They were the fastest wildebeests on the savannah.
We're talking fast.
All the other lions had given up the hunt hours ago, except your old man.
Fortunately, I knew a short cut.
I thought I had 'em.
Until the dust cleared.
Classic wildebeest trap.
So, what did you do next?
- What did I do?
- Yeah.
That's when I gave them the roar.
- That's it?
- Hold on a sec.
I only thought it was over.
But they had a secret weapon.
He was the biggest wildebeest I've ever seen.
- He was 14 feet tall!
- Fourteen?
I meant 1,401 feet tall!
Cool.
And he had two...
No, four of the biggest horns I'd ever seen.
- Whoa!
- His breath was red hot!
I mean, green.
And he hated the environment.
To pull this off, I knew I was gonna have to dig deep, deeper than I ever had before.
So I swallowed my fear, sucked in the biggest breath I could.
Dad, I'm ready!
- You got it?
- I got it!
- I got it!
- Well, let him have it!
Roar, son!
Story of my life.
Your roar stops a herd of wildebeests.
Mine makes the babies laugh.
Hey, come on.
That was much better.
I'm serious!
It dropped half an octave.
It dropped half an octave.
And it sure scared me.
- Made my hair stand up on end.
- Yeah, right, Dad.
- OK.
Let's take it from the top.
- I'm done for today.
Come on, come on, one more.
You were so close.
Maybe it's something technical.
Maybe you're not opening your mouth wide enough.
Like this.
Dad, thanks for the technical help, but if you wanted me to roar like you, you'd take me to the wild.
Hold on a second.
We've got everything we could ever want here.
Great lifestyle, three squares a day.
- It's boring.
- Boring?
- I'll never learn how to roar here.
- Ryan.
But don't worry.
I finally figured out
- how we can get to the wild.
- You did?
The pigeons say those green boxes go there.
Those boxes are bad news.
Stay away.
- But, Dad...
- I know you're frustrated,
- but a lion finds his roar...
- Here.
I'm so tired of hearing that, Dad!
It's a rat!
Get that rat off my baby!
A rat?
Hello!
Silly, silly rat.
- Rats do not got bling like this, lady.
- You little...!
Lastly, that is the ugliest baby I've ever seen!
Benny, stealing candy from a baby?
Stealing is such a strong word.
I prefer "liberating."
Hey, kid, heard the roar.
Down another...
- Octave.
- Octave!
You ready to cheer me and your old man as we capture our fifth straight turtle-curling title?
I can't even roar.
How would you even know I'm there?
So, you really think it dropped an octave?
Absolutely.
- What the heck is an octave?
- I heard that.
- Rabbit.
- Cholesterol.
I'll stick with the nuts.
I don't know what his problem is, Benny.
He's 11, but he's still roaring at a nine-year-old level.
Little help here, Sammy?
You know what?
Maybe you're setting the bar too high, with all those stories about Samson the Wild.
Hey, he's always loved those stories!
They inspire him.
OK.
I'm not gonna argue with someone who can use my tail as dental floss.
- You got something right there.
- Where?
- No, no, other side.
- Here?
- Sorry, Benny.
- You got it.
Attention, friends.
Stop by the gift shop and get the most popular plush in America:
Nigel, the "I-Like-You" Koala.
- Look, honey!
The crazy thing talks!
- I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
That's right.
He's so cuddly.
And better yet, he likes you.
Finally.
And the zoo will officially be ours in T-minus three two and showtime!
Here I come!
Who put that bar there?
That tickles!
- Did too!
- Did not!
- Did too!
- Did not!
Out of my way, ya bum!
There's that moth-eaten koala!
I've told you flamingos a hundred times, walk.
- How about an autograph?
!
- Don't...
Birds!
Find the string on his back!
- So you're havin' a really nice day!
- Guys.
Off my co-captain, now.
Sorry, Samson.
That didn't hurt.
I almost forgot to tell you.
I'm gonna ask Bridget out finally.
Slow down, Romeo.
You are a squirrel and she is...
Perfect, right?
Look, I know what you're sayin'.
Believe me, I got my eyes wide open.
Watch where you're goin', you big...!
Bridget.
Don't stare at my spots, Benny.
My eyes are up here.
Of course.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, this is for you, honey.
It goes around your left hoof.
Did you get that out of the trash?
You did!
You trash-picker!
I'm not a trash-picker.
I'm a recycler.
That's a lot more romantic.
Isn't it?
- Romantic?
- Sam, come here.
Romantic?
Don't mention romance to me, Benny.
- I've never had a boyfriend.
- That settles it.
I accept the job...
of boyfriend number one.
Benny, only the female orb-weaver spider will date a male one-twentieth her size.
- So there's hope!
- And then she eats him.
But at least he dies happy.
Let's get Ryan, dude!
Dude!
We said that at the same time!
Dude.
Hey!
Hey, Ryan.
Listen, I'm headin' down to the game.
I'm gonna see you there, right?
Come on, Ryan.
We need you.
You're our biggest fan.
Yo, Samson!
I'm your number one fan, man!
Thanks, man.
Right back at ya!
You were saying, Dad?
Listen.
About this afternoon, I was just trying...
Dad, fine.
I'll go to your game, all right?
OK.
I'll... see you there, then.
Come on, dude.
- Dude.
- Guess who's here?
Eze.
Duke.
Man, he always guesses.
We're gonna stalk the gazelles while everybody's at the game.
- You in?
- Let's go, bro!
The Ryanator.
I'm comin' down.
Fish heads!
Get your ice-cold fish heads!
Now eyeball-free!
We're into the final period of the curling championships and the penguins are up.
Here comes Victor.
What a beauty!
Yeah, sweep!
Heading straight for the bull's-eye!
This could be it, folks!
- Bo-wango!
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah!
- That's gonna be tough to beat.
What? "Tough to beat"?
That's just the way we like it, right, guys?
I can't believe this!
If we lose, I'm gonna rip my head off!
And yours!
We cannot lose to flightless birds!
Whoa, whoa.
No one is losing anything around here.
As long as we stay focused.
- By the way, has anyone seen Ryan?
- Oh!
I know!
Maybe he's sulking 'cause he lives in his father's shadow and he roars like a schoolgirl.
- Thanks, Lar.
- You betcha!
Nigel!
Nigel!
Will you sign my dolly?
- Not again.
- Nigel, ignore them.
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
- You're so cuddly!
We love you!
- That's it!
I am not cuddly!
I'm a vicious jungle animal from the streets of London!
- Fear me!
- Get him!
Get him!
Get him!
- Help me!
- Girls!
Put him down.
I am not a doll!
- Cushy tushy!
- Leave my bum alone!
Nigel!
Get your paws off my girlfriend!
Benny, I am not your girlfriend!
Really nice day!
What is up with Samson's team tonight?
Brutal!
Benny?
Oh, my gosh!
Who knows mouth-to-mouth?
I do!
What was that?
Just your daily dose of vitamin Benny, baby.
- Get off my nose.
- I'm so cuddly, I like you!
- Stop saying that!
- G'day, mate!
Cannonball!
Next year, I should just coach.
Check it.
The Thomson gazelle.
Zero to 50 in four-point-five seconds.
- The ultimate fleeing machine.
- There is no substitute.
Let's get a closer look at these slim jims.
- Shall we?
- I think we shall.
Maybe we should just go to the game.
- I thought you wanted to be wild.
- Your dad chased gazelles.
Yeah, if he were our age, he would so be rockin' out with us.
He'd be in there, runnin' 'em down like they were...
- Gazelles.
- Yeah, gazelles or somethin'.
Ready, man?
We'd better not.
Oh, yeah?
Are you gonna stop us?
- Guys, guys.
- Here we go!
The whole series comes down to this throw!
There's no tomorrow!
It's do or die!
Ya know what I mean.
Guys, I know we're down, but we're gonna pull this out 'cause we're gonna use...
- ...the secret play.
- The secret play!
Hey, everybody, guess what?
We're gonna use the secret play!
Larry, the first part of the secret play is keeping it secret.
- OK.
- Follow my lead.
I'm going to need a double effort from everybody.
Absolutely, captain.
Triple effort if you want, sir.
- Good.
Ready, and...
- Break!
Quiet.
On three, dude.
One, two...
No!
Now you did it, Ryan.
Feelin' mean, Donald?
Bring it on!
Folks, there's pressure on the big guy!
- Ready, Bridget?
- Ready.
- Ready, Benny?
- Ready!
Samson, it's a shame your little brat isn't here to see you lose.
I can't... hold it!
Oh, no!
What are you doin'?
And here comes Samson.
Look at that guy.
Is he a beauty or what?
Larry!
Bridget!
Sweep!
What a recovery!
He's sendin' in Bridget and Larry to do the job!
Sweep faster, Larry!
Sweep, sweep!
- I am!
- Come on, man!
Team Penguin is sending their ace, Victor...
- Watch it, Victor!
- Watch it yourself, see?
Nigel, how are we looking?
- This could be trouble, folks!
- Sweep, sweep, sweep.
This is cheating and you will die for this.
I can't hear you, Nigel.
Move left a bit...
OK.
Move left and hit!
- Larry, no!
- Tallyho!
What a move!
Folks, we are inches away from the greatest upset in turtle-curling history!
- Oh, no!
I can't believe my eyes!
- No!
Looks like Samson might have choked!
- Nice!
- Yes!
Unbelievable!
Samson and his team have clinched the title!
- No, wait!
I've called it too soon!
- What the heck?
The penguins have done it!
They're zoo champs for the first time!
Stampede?
Stampede!
Please!
Stop!
Watch out!
Dude.
Busted.
Catastrophic.
Told you I'd come to the game.
You think this is funny?
You just endangered everyone in the zoo!
- I'm sorry.
- For what?
Chasing the gazelles or costing us the game?
All you do is sit up in your tree and sulk.
- If you just...
- What's the problem?
Is all this because you can't roar?
Ryan, I didn't mean that.
Know what I'm doing when I'm sulking in my tree?
I'm thinking how great it would be if Samson the Wild wasn't my father.
Ryan, I didn't...
'Cause it would make being Ryan the Lame a lot easier.
Ryan, I'm sorry.
Ryan!
Please don't leave.
Bye, Ryan!
Thanks for coming to the game.
And you were worried he wouldn't show up.
Not good.
No one listens to the squirrel.
I don't know what to do anymore, Benny.
- I've tried everything.
- Everything?
- You tried everything?
- What are you saying?
I'm saying you have to tell him the truth.
I don't think I could do that, Benny.
I mean...
What's he gonna think of me when he finds out?
I don't know.
But if you don't tell him you're gonna lose him, Sammy.
The green boxes.
OK, they're all loaded up!
- You don't think I know that?
- Get movin'!
I changed my mind!
I don't wanna go!
Help!
Ryan.
Help me!
Watch out!
Sam!
- Wait for us!
- Dad!
- Ryan!
- Dad!
Don't let them take me!
- No!
- Ryan!
Help!
- No!
- Dad!
Help me!
Ryan!
- Benny, we need that truck followed.
- Check.
Get me... the pigeons.
I am wanting snake eyes!
Come on, baby.
Come on, just throw it.
Thanks.
Hamir!
You are the great loser of all time!
What offerings must I make, I wonder?
Hamir!
Hamir!
Get a grip on yourself!
Benny!
I am needing till Friday before I am paying you back!
No, no.
It's Ryan.
He's in one of those green boxes and they took it away!
We've got to find him!
That is not good!
Not good at all!
I know!
I know!
I am telling him, you crazy pigeon!
The green boxes go to the big water where stiff lady with spikes on her head...
- Hamir?
I can't understand...
- Spikes!
Just tell me where the green boxes go.
Stiff lady, spikies?
Yes, like my wife says, the truck takes them to her!
To her!
Though I hate telling bad news, there is more bad news to tell.
When the sun rises, the green boxes leave on boat-boat and never return!
I am sorry for this.
I really am.
Hello?
No.
Not good.
Not good.
You always say that.
I keep on sayin' it.
No one's listenin'.
Like a broken record here.
OK.
When do we leave, Sammy?
Yeah, when do we leave?
It's not "we".
It's me.
Let's make this clear.
This is now a rescue mission and I am the only one going.
We'll come too!
We're not afraid.
Are we, guys?
Afraid?
No.
You know koalas.
More like "scared of things."
Ryan's like a cub to all of us.
Not that I'll ever have one of my own at this rate.
You know, there's that famous...
A koala once said,
"We will fight them... with peaches."
Yeah.
Anyway.
- So we're helping, whatever it takes.
- You want to leave with me?
OK.
If you don't mind being hunted down, shot at...
- ...stuffed...
- OK!
...or worse, then fine.
I have a recurring nightmare about taxidermy and spot remover.
Well, they have to catch us before they can stuff us and I'm fast.
Nobody's leaving but me.
Got it?
- You're the boss.
- You bet.
- You got the big hair.
- Absolutely.
Yeah, that's good, Sammy.
Hey, way to weed out the weak links.
Now that they're out of the picture, what's the plan?
Don't worry about a thing, big guy.
I got it all taken care of.
I know this city like the back of my paw.
We ditch this truck at Fifth Avenue, couple lefts, couple rights, bada-boom, past Broadway and...
You're there!
What are you doing here?
- What?
- We're going to help you find Ryan!
She said, "We're gonna help you find Ryan."
- Oh, great.
- Hey, guys.
I've got popcorn up my bum.
Do I look trashy in this?
OK, here's my...
Here's my overall plan.
Where are we going?
I only have until sunrise before Ryan is taken away forever!
And now I have to worry about you three?
All right, fine.
When do we get off of this thing, Benny?
Benny's here?
Yeah, he's right there.
Benny?
Benny!
Great.
Now what am I gonna do?
Guys!
Guys!
I think we should duck!
What is she saying?
She said, "Duck down!"
Duck!
I am not in the mood for a game of footsie or hoofsie or pawsie or...
That wasn't my paw.
It was this!
I didn't steal it.
I borrowed it.
It'll light the way to Ryan.
The walls are moving.
Right, right.
The walls...
The walls are moving!
Larry, hold your breath!
Larry, stay straight!
Everybody out!
All right, don't panic.
What we've got to do...
This is definitely not good.
Samson!
- Give me your hoof!
- Help!
Larry!
The garbage!
It lives!
Guys?
OK, anybody?
I'm freakin' out.
- What's the hold up?
- Hello?
We're over here, Nigel.
Right.
I'll be there in a minute.
Think.
What did Benny say?
Couple of lefts, couple of rights.
Bridget, can you see the green lady?
I'm looking, I'm looking, but I can't see over anything for a change.
How far are you away?
You in a different continent?
Is that you, Larry?
Up here, Nige.
You're a very furry snake.
Guys...
We don't want to draw attention to ourselves.
Dogs.
This should be fun for you, Samson.
Nigel!
Grab Bridget!
- What?
- Run!
I'm gonna throw up!
I'm gonna throw up!
Shouldn't you be tearing them to shreds?
All part of the plan.
This maneuver's known as the Serengeti Slip.
Page ten of the Predator's Playbook.
What next?
Page 11?
Go on, you mutts!
Stupid dogs, we could've taken you.
Taken you to a...
To a disco!
Larry, improvise!
- Larry, that's not helping.
- OK.
You dogs think you got bark?
Well, Samson's got roar!
- Show 'em, Sam.
- Dig deep, Samson.
You're a lion.
Be a lion.
Look at that guy!
Sam, they are frothing at the mouth.
OK...
- Larry, coil!
- Check!
- Sam!
- I improvised.
Now jump!
- Down there?
- Yes!
We're leaving, Larry!
Teensy question, Samson.
With those dogs up there, why didn't you just do what you did in the wild?
You know, lionize 'em or lionate them or lionify them?
I don't have time to fight dogs, Bridget.
We have to find Ryan, remember?
What is this stinky place?
It appears to be a human bathing area.
You mean humans don't lick themselves clean?
Disgusting!
They're hopeless.
It is hard to believe they are at the top of the food chain.
I can't imagine beginning the day without licking myself.
No hurry, but is there a plan?
Of course there's a plan.
We follow this water to the big water, and then we find the lady with...
Larry, either your stomach is growling or something in it is growling.
Wasn't me.
What?
- Smooth move, Nigel!
- Oh, boy!
Twins!
OK, Sammy, hurry it up now, 'cause these guys are seeming to have acid reflux or something!
Everybody... stay calm.
- Calm?
- Not good.
Yo.
Boo!
I'm gonna say, it looks like you and your crew here are a little far from your borough.
Far from your borough!
I love it.
We're going to the big water.
Nigel, show them what we're looking for.
- Like this?
- I think it's in her right hand.
- And isn't she blue?
- I can't do blue.
- No idea.
You?
- Doesn't even register.
- You're batting' zero, kid.
- Do the thing with...
Make your bloody mind up.
The big female with the spikes on her melon!
They're tourists.
All right, tourists, listen up.
Ya gotta get to Battery Park.
First take the Broadway culvert.
- Down the Broadway culvert?
- What's wrong with that?
- They get lost at the sewage plant!
- Get outta here!
- What are you talking about?
- How would you send 'em?
You're sendin' 'em the wrong way!
The Wall Street culvert is blocked with construction.
- That is true.
- All right.
Guys, you gonna help or not?
Yeah, sure.
Of course we're gonna help ya's.
We're one big family, right?
Except for that guy there.
He scares the...
You done runnin' your mouth yet, Carmine?
Are ya?
I apologize.
He never got over being flushed down the toilet.
Yeah.
Follow me, 'cause you four won't last ten minutes in this neighborhood.
It's a jungle down here.
- Stan, you know who that is?
- What?
No.
That's one of them talkin' kawana bears!
How ya doing?
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I've seen a lot of those things floating' here in the sewer.
That's good!
You're makin' me laugh over here.
Just wait for me!
Are we in the right place?
Any place without two hilarious alligators seems a move in the right direction.
- Sam, do you see anything up there?
- I sure do.
Well, well, well.
There she is, like Hamir said.
And it's sunrise, which means we're a tad short on time.
Guys, look.
We know the box Ryan's in is green.
It's gotta be around here, so I need you to...
Yeah.
So we should shout out if we see a box that looks like the ones over there.
It hasn't left yet!
We can make it!
- Let's go!
- Hold on, Larry!
- Which way now?
- Yeah, which way?
Run!
No!
No!
Ryan's on that thing!
We've got to stop it!
- We can't, Sam!
- I don't care!
- No, Sammy, you'll drown!
- Sam!
I failed.
Again.
I only count one failure.
It's big, but it's just one.
Goodbye, Ryan.
We're gonna miss ya.
- Samson!
- What on earth is going on?
It's a human and I do not think he works for the zoo.
Perhaps now is a good time to improvise.
What?
Great!
One problem down...
Far out.
Cool.
One disaster to go.
What are you doing?
We're headed for the other boat!
How do we steer?
Who knows how to steer?
None of us.
We're animals.
Great!
- Hold on, Larry.
Do that again.
- Do what?
Whatever you just did, but the opposite!
But I don't know my opposites!
No, Larry, like this!
I think I've got it.
Well, that was easy.
Oh, dear.
Has anyone got any eucalyptus wipes?
This isn't so difficult.
I'm the lion of the sea!
Well done, sir.
Captain of our team and now captain of this vessel.
You're brilliant.
I hate to be Miss Negative, but in this melee, we seem to have lost Ryan's boat.
- What, nothing?
- Nothing.
He's gone.
No.
There!
Nelson!
The green boxes!
- You're sure, eh?
- And there's my buddies!
And my love!
Let's go in!
- We'll head away from the sun.
- No, towards the sun.
To the north.
Starboard...
Leftboard.
Just follow my finger.
Please.
You guys wouldn't know the answer if it fell from the sky and hit you in the head.
Oh, my!
It's a bat!
It's a bat!
Get it off me!
Get it off me!
- Benny!
- Benny?
Geese!
- Are you all right?
- Yes, my princess.
Benny, you made it!
You're my best friend.
Best friends should stick together.
Even not-so-best friends, who knock you off a speeding garbage truck.
Excuse me, but I begged them to go back and get you.
Just so you know.
Benny, could you see Ryan's boat from up there?
Well, it just so happens I saw it heading that way.
And we're in luck!
- How's it goin', eh?
- Canadian geese!
Experts at intercontinental travel.
Hey, birdie, OK, is it true that Canada has lax immigration policies for koalas?
I'll take it from here.
My son's out there.
We really need your help.
Can you lead us to that boat?
No problem, eh?
Just follow us and Bob's your uncle.
Try not to lag too far behind, eh?
Hey, Benny, thanks.
And fyi, Bridget was very concerned when you fell off the truck.
Bet you didn't know I could ride geese, did you?
- Bareback.
- Oh, brother.
Sammy?
We going to the wild now?
I think we are, Larry.
I can't take it anymore.
He's taunting us!
Listen!
Stop laughing at us, you solar twit!
Captain Bligh, sir!
Are the ice cream cones ready?
The crew, they're on the verge of mutiny.
Nigel, please.
If you don't give us ice creams pretty quick, you're gonna walk the plank, sir!
- Nigel.
- I don't care if I drown,
I'm getting off this death cruise right now.
Iceberg!
Permission to go down with the ship, sir.
Hang on!
Stuff that!
Run!
Swim!
Nigel?
Look, I'm a starfish.
Guys, look.
Gosh.
Must feel like a lifetime since you've been here.
Yeah... a lifetime.
What the heck?
Wow!
Look!
They're releasing the green boxes back into the wild.
- Larry.
- Guys, they're putting animals inside the green boxes.
I just can't figure out why.
It's a tunnel to another dimension, can't you see?
- They go in...
- Who is this guy?
It's all right, Nigel.
Think it has anything to do with that?
Hang on a second.
Either I'm starving or Larry is making sense.
You're right.
Those animals are being rescued.
Ryan?
Ryan!
Oh, no!
Ryan!
We've got to move fast!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Where are you, buddy?
Ryan!
- I can't believe it!
- Samson!
I was so close.
He was right there!
- We'll never find him now!
- Come here!
Will you get a hold of yourself?
Use your instincts.
I don't want to run anymore.
Good. 'Cause frankly, you need a good sports bra.
- Ryan?
- Everything's under control.
- Temporary setback.
- I got it.
- I got Ryan's scent!
- He got it?
I mean, he got it!
Let's go!
- Hooray!
- Wait for us!
I'm not designed for this!
I want a car.
Hey, guys, I found him!
Ryan!
Doesn't anyone knock anymore?
Where's my son?
Did he come through here?
Yeah, now that I think about it, he did come through here.
Hello?
Come on out, baby lion!
Your dad's here!
Well, what do you know?
There's a whole pride of lions here!
Funky.
I was under the impression you had Ryan's scent, not this olfactory insult.
I...
I had Ryan's scent, but my predator instincts must've kicked in since, you know, I haven't eaten for a while.
Exactly!
You never know when those instincts are gonna kick in.
Excellent.
Fantastic!
We get to see the legend in action.
I'd love to, but we just don't have time.
We got the time, Sammy.
Just...
And then you do this.
And then this bit.
Rip him apart!
The horror.
I can't bear to watch!
But I have to.
Go on.
Get out of here.
- The legend dropped his dinner.
- Oh, boy.
What's wrong?
I'm not good enough for you to eat?
No.
It's just I'm allergic to nuts.
Now I get it.
You're gonna toy with me?
Beat me up a little, then pounce when I get my hopes up?
How exciting.
Come on, guys.
Ryan can't be far.
Hey!
I'm not finished with you!
I am a delicacy.
My flesh has fruity wood notes!
Watch it, you little hors d'oeuvre.
That's Samson the Wild.
You call this wild?
This is a cat!
A big, fat, tame pussycat!
- OK, that's enough!
- The pussycat hissed at me!
Maybe I should hide behind the koala for protection.
While we're at it, could you slap me in the face?
No.
What are you, a twit?
- Ignore him.
- Don't bother!
I'm leaving.
- You're weird.
- Run for your lives!
It's a lion with moral issues!
And I've had it with you too!
Thanks a lot for wrecking my day!
Teensy question.
Or more like a...
a sort of a query meets a statement.
That hyrax back there?
It was sort of like you couldn't eat him.
Yeah, and what about those dogs?
There was no munching there, either.
If I didn't know any better, I'd say that you're...
- A vegetarian?
- Nope.
- That's not what I was going to say.
- You were going to say...
- It's almost like...
- You're not from...
The wild?
Well, you're right.
I'm not from the wild.
What?
I'm just a phony.
Truth is I can't protect you out here.
Please just go back to the boat.
I've got to find my son.
Tell me we're not in a dangerous jungle with an 8-inch squirrel protecting us.
Actually, I'm nine inches, but other than that, yes.
So that means...
We are going to die!
Hey, guys!
Guys!
Will the three of you calm down?
How could he lie to us?
- We're his best friends.
- Sure.
Maybe he lied 'cause he didn't want to tell us the truth.
OK, yeah, whatever.
Whatever.
Let's just go back to the boat, then.
The fierce, the proud, the wild...
Rubbish!
But wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait!
Where you goin'?
Stop right there!
Stop!
Bridget, if you go, I'm...
I'm breaking up with you.
We were never going out in the first place.
Then we're taking a break.
- Nigel!
- All right!
Hey, listen!
I know you're scared.
But at least we got each other.
Sammy's got nobody.
He's out there all alone.
And... so is Ryan.
OK, OK, focus, Samson.
He's got to be out there somewhere.
You'll find him.
I mean, how big can this place be, anyway?
Ryan!
Hey there, little fella.
You're lost too, huh?
You remind me of my buddy back home.
A bloodthirsty monster!
Where?
Where?
He's a killer!
Get away from my baby!
Calm down, lady!
Won't anyone save my baby?
Bye-bye.
Ryan!
Ryan!
Sammy!
I wasn't meant for the wild.
I was made to nibble and be elegant and to appear in children's books as the letter G.
Come on, this isn't scary, is it?
It's just leaves and vines and...
Oh, that's my foot.
Nigel, keep a lookout back there.
- You too, Larry!
- Okeydokey.
Oh, I see.
All right, OK, yeah.
You're giving me the silent treatment.
Like I care.
Nigel!
I gave you an order.
Would a little "Sir, yes, sir!" kill ya?
Nigel.
That's not funny, Nigel.
- He's gone!
We're doomed.
- Nigel!
First Ryan, then Samson, and now Nigel!
I do believe in zoos.
- Larry, you're tensing up!
- I do, I do, I do.
- Don't panic.
I'm in charge.
- That's why we're panicking!
I say we fan out and circle.
What are we, peacocks?
We don't fan, we run.
Run for your lives, everybody!
Guys, I've got an idea.
Why don't we ask them?
It's OK...
They, you see, they got hooves.
That means they don't hunt.
They graze.
But they're licking their chops.
I'll take the one with the funny knees.
The funny knee...?
Benny, no!
Benny?
Get them.
Just, hey, back off.
I'm sorry,
I'm not that kind of koala bear.
Right.
Excuse me?
Hello?
Terribly sorry to bother you, but do you speak koala?
Sprechen Sie koala?
Right.
Could you possibly not go towards the big smoking thing?
G'day, mate G'day, mate
G'day, mate G'day, mate
G'day, mate G'day, mate
What a strange place for a party.
Very good, very organized.
Can I use your toilet?
I'm having a
Really nice day Really nice day
Really nice day
I'm having a
Really nice day Really nice day
Really nice day
- Why don't you all
- Tickle away, tickle away
They're frighteningly horrible monster beasts but they're not bad dancers.
I'm so cuddly I like you
I'm so cuddly I like you
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
- I'm having a
- Really nice day
Oh, no!
Tickle away Tickle away
I'm so cuddly, I like you Good day
- What is that?
- I am Kazar.
Leader.
Prophet.
Choreographer.
And with your help... carnivore!
No!
Don't kill me!
I've had such a weird life!
This is not fair.
Oh, I get it.
A yoga retreat.
Ryan!
You can do this.
Use your instincts.
Follow your instincts.
Use your instincts.
OK.
Down this way.
This way.
A lion cub.
We must tell Kazar.
- It's my turn to tell him.
- You got to last time.
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!
Thank you very much, but I'm afraid I've got to run.
Koalas are very busy bees.
If I could...
I'll just buzz along to the door...
For centuries, we've watched our brethren perish at the claw of the lion.
Today, we put our hooves down.
No longer will we dwell at the bottom of the food chain.
Well, yes.
I should say so.
There were those who doubted that you'd arrive to lead us.
But I always believed in the Omen.
The Omen!
Right.
Remind me again?
Sent down by the gods years ago...
Oh, no!
Not you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
Oh, Great Him, you must lead us in our transformation from prey to predator.
Hold it.
I am the Great Him?
- The Great Him?
- Him.
So this is all your fault!
That's it!
You...!
- Kazar!
- Kazar!
Don't listen to him!
- Kazar!
Over here!
- Kazar!
Over here!
How dare you interrupt my audience with the Great Him!
But... but we found a lion cub!
- You did?
- Was he with a big lion?
With big hair?
Well, a mullet, really.
Oh, Great Him, you brought two lions with you?
Well, like any Great Him,
I travel with an entourage.
Worry not, Your Himness, I shall have Blag bring the lions here.
And he better not screw this up, like you screwed up my dance number!
I lost count for one verse.
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
Why do we even bother rehearsing?
A good chorus line is so hard to put together.
Take to the skies!
We're taking!
We're taking!
- Find them!
- Yes, sir.
Bring us those lions!
The gods celebrate the fulfillment of the prophecy.
We stamp our hooves in praise of the Great Him!
Holy moly!
Holy moly Holy moly
You are our king!
Looky, looky who's there.
Surprise!
No!
Sorry we're late for dinner!
That's pathetic!
Get off!
- That didn't hurt!
- Stop!
- Ryan!
- No!
I'm coming, son!
Dad?
- Help!
- Let's scram!
- Ryan!
- What are you doing here?
- I can't believe it!
I found you.
- How'd you find me?
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
- Your paw.
- I got trapped in that box.
It's OK, son.
And then I escaped, and I ran into the jungle then those vultures came and tried to kill me.
You wouldn't have been scared.
I was.
- I have to tell you something.
- What?
Listen.
- Get 'em, Dad!
- Run!
Run!
Dad, you should be chasing them!
- Like you used to!
- Those were just stories!
But now's your chance to show me for real!
This way!
- Dad?
What's goin' on?
- Just get up into that tree!
- I think we lost them.
- What's the deal?
They're just a bunch of wimpy donkeys!
You could kick their rumps!
- Ryan, I can't fight them.
- You donkey-chickens!
Get back here!
Ryan!
I can't fight them.
What do you mean?
I was young still just a cub.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Children of all ages.
Samson!
Swallow that fear and stand tall!
Witness the greatest day in our young lion's life!
The day he discovers his roar!
Dad, I can't do it!
Now, go!
Listen as Samson unleashes a roar so mighty, it launches a wildebeest clear off the savannah!
Samson!
Dig deep!
I should have known.
If you'd been born in the wild, you'd know how to roar.
Dad?
Dad!
Dad!
Please!
Dad.
When they shipped me to the zoo, I never wanted anyone to know where I came from.
Especially those closest to me.
I should have told you sooner.
But... all those stories you tell?
I'm so sorry, Ryan.
Everything you told me was a lie?
- Dad!
- Hang on, son.
Help!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Run!
Not so fast, Tigger.
Dad!
Ryan!
Dad!
- Help!
- Ryan.
Help!
Dad!
- Ryan.
- Dad!
Help me!
What?
Wait!
What?
What?
Wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Get off me!
What is goin' on here?
- Stinky does not speak.
- It rolls like a little ball.
Wait.
You guys think I'm a...?
- Achtung, Stinky!
- Less talk, more roll.
- Ja.
- Roll!
Roll!
What the...?
Hey!
Rolling the dung is good for tight buns!
I'll give you something to roll about!
It's a good thing Bridget didn't see that!
Bridget?
Larry!
They're gone.
I gotta find them!
No!
I gotta find Samson first!
No!
First...
Sam.
Sam!
Bridget!
Larry!
Oh, Ryan!
You're alive!
Good to see you guys.
- Where's my hug?
- Larry.
- There it is.
- It's good to see you too.
What are you guys doing here?
We came here with your father to find you.
And he's probably out there right now lookin' for us.
I wish he were.
But some of these wildebeests pushed him off a cliff.
- What?
- What?
I don't think he made it.
I don't see how he could.
Oh, Ryan.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Kazar, I think you'll be very pleased with what I brought you.
What's this?
Where's the other lion?
Right.
Well, I was gonna tell you, there was this cliff and...
Why are you looking at me like that?
That's twice you've been out of step today, Blag!
You klutz.
You know we can't ascend to the top of the food chain until we eat a lion!
Well, at least there'll be enough for my ascension.
What about the rest of us?
Step-kick, pivot-kick!
Ouch!
I twisted a hoof!
You work and you work.
Then they break your heart.
- There goes my career!
- Prepare the sacrifices!
Why did I let him go off by himself?
He couldn't catch a cold, much less his own lunch.
Bet I could catch you.
Please.
My natural predator is fuel inject...
What?
I knew you weren't really gone.
I knew it!
Come on, I knew it!
We're still buddies, right?
I lost Ryan.
There were too many.
They just took him.
Who?
Who took him?
- Wildebeests.
- The freaks with the hooves!
They got Larry and Bridget too.
Couldn't fight, couldn't...
Come on, Sam.
You're a lion.
You come from a long line of kings.
Yeah, maybe you're not from the wild.
But fighting's in your blood!
No.
I'll never be a real lion.
Wrong!
You are a real lion.
Doesn't matter where you're from:
Zoo, jungle, goldfish bowl.
It's what's in here.
That determines who you are!
At least, that's what you always told your son.
Now he's out there, Sammy, and he needs you.
Who else is gonna teach him how to roar?
That's it, Sammy.
That's it.
Let's go find my son...
and my friends.
Yeah!
Nothing's gonna stop us!
Except that we have no idea where we're going!
Follow your instincts.
Follow your instincts.
- What is that?
- My... instincts?
- Benny?
- You're almost there.
That settles it, then.
My mother definitely drank pool water when she was pregnant with me.
Benny, look.
The freaks with hooves!
Ryan's in there.
You can't just barge in.
That's suicide!
- Benny, get out of my way!
- Don't listen to the rat.
- Hey, who are you calling a rat?
- You, of course.
- You'll give away our position.
- I'll have you written up for that!
Fool!
You blew our cover!
Men!
Scatter!
Not so fast!
Look who I got, Sammy.
It's your lion instincts.
Who are you guys?
- Our names aren't important.
- I'm Cloak.
He's Camo.
- We're covert agents.
- Why have you been leading me around?
- That's classified.
- Top-secret.
- The wildebeests have gone mad.
- Cloak.
It's not like I told them our plan is to use them to defeat Kazar's...
Listen, just tell me, did they take my son in there?
- That's need-to-know.
- They did.
- They think the koala's a god.
- You're the worst covert agent!
Oh, yeah?
Then why can I do this?
Men!
Hey!
No!
Stop!
Sammy!
- Idiot!
That maneuver's confidential.
- It's secret.
This one's confidential.
- Cloak!
- And this one's restricted.
Super-secret.
Top-secret.
This is ultra-secret!
Enough!
No more!
Show 'em the super-top-secret "no more?" Gotcha!
No!
I got an idea.
Who is this Great Him, anyway?
I'll take him on.
I'm the Great Her!
I'll show Him a thing or two.
I'm from New York City, for Pete's sake.
Oh, my.
You have got to be kidding me.
Nigel, I don't know what you're trying to pull,
- but I will kick your...
- Silence!
Why, you little...
Silence, again!
You do not speak to me!
Nigel, what's the deal?
Great Him, shall we prepare the feast?
Yes, we shall!
What's on the menu?
Them.
Oh, no.
Eat friends and be god, don't eat friends...
God, friends, god, friends.
God, I...
Well, that was subtle.
Prepare the meat fire!
Wait!
We cannot cook them without onion!
Onions.
Onions.
Onions.
Well, that was fast.
Let the ritual begin.
Move it!
I am so mad at you!
Wait!
We also need... hats!
Do we not have the party hats of death?
I've got mine!
And before the feast, we must all...
What the...?
...levitate and spin uncontrollably!
And feel a bit sick.
How do I stop this thing?
- Guys.
- Benny?
- Look, a squirrel!
- Larry!
We've got a plan.
Follow me.
- We?
- I can fly!
Oh, Great Him, we are humbled by your power.
Be humbled.
Only the Great Him can do this!
- Volcanic gas!
- Our cover's blown!
Major malfunction!
Abandon ship!
- Oh, boy.
- Well, about time you got here.
Great Him, it's another miracle!
You've delivered us a real lion!
Blag, your luck has turned.
Thanks to the Great Him, we shall all ascend tonight.
Nigel, we've got to create a distraction.
Hang on a sec!
I've got miracles comin' out my ears!
Ready?
Stand back as the Great Me attacks the lion over 73 times my size!
Dad?
My dad's alive!
Guys, my dad made it!
- Ryan, no!
- Hurry, I got to see him!
Whack, whack, whack!
- Dad!
- What?
Ryan!
- I planned this.
- Ryan, no!
At long last, the cosmic balance has shifted.
- Stay close.
- Prey has become predator!
And predator has become prey!
And the hoof finally trumps the claw!
Come on, Dad!
Let's show these turkey-jerkies who's at the top of the food chain!
Let's eat the brat first.
Over my dead body!
Yeah.
Dad!
He's gonna kill Samson if we don't do something!
Why don't we use the secret play?
I know.
Shut up, Larry.
That's stupid.
No!
It's brilliant!
They laughed at me when I spoke of the Omen.
But look who's laughing now!
Little to the left.
Yeah.
No!
Little to the right!
Next floor: bottom of the food chain!
Ding!
Fire!
We gotta find something bigger!
I know where we can find something bigger.
- Ready, Ryan?
- Dig deep!
You should have stayed at home.
Now our shrine will become your tomb.
Fire!
Ryan!
Ryan!
I don't typically eat dessert before the main course!
Get away from my son!
Ryan.
Ryan, are you still with me?
It's OK, Dad.
I just want you to know
I'm sorry you didn't have a father like the one I have.
Ryan.
How touching.
But then, last words usually are.
Finish them.
What are you doing?
I command you to attack them, like true predators!
We're tired of pretending to be something we're not.
But most of all, we're tired of you.
Blag.
Fine.
I'll kill them myself!
Dad, remember what you always told me in your stories:
Dig deep.
Oh, yeah, baby!
Let's go.
Yeah.
- Come on, let's get out of here!
- Get out of here!
And for the record, I've always hated your choreography.
It's so... '80s.
That's right!
Run!
Run like the cowardly prey that you are!
I will hunt you down!
Everyone!
To the boat!
Top of the food chain, Ma!
Top of the food chain...
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
Hurry!
We're never gonna make it!
Push, you crazy, hairy monsters!
Push!
- Larry, throw it in reverse!
- Reverse throwing!
At least I saw the wild before it disappeared.
I can still see it.
It's right...
Here.
I found my roar.
We both did, son.
You know, Dad, this'll be our first story of Samson and Ryan the Wild.
I don't think anybody's gonna believe it.
Incoming!
I'm so cuddly!
Cuddly!
I'm so cuddly!
I know you're cuddly.
But can you float?
- I'm having a
- Really nice day
Really nice day Really nice day
Step-kick left!
Really nice day
Step-kick right!
- Splendid.
- No!
Smashing.
Hey!
- Stupendous!
- Are you guys sure about this?
Operation Snake-Over is now complete.
Hey, look, everyone!
I'm a secret agent!
Bridget, I get it.
You're more than a tall, lanky goddess.
You're a strong, independent female.
You don't need to be defined by your relationship
- and I, I respect that.
- It's about time.
What was that?
Just your daily dose of vitamin Bridget, baby.
Oh, yeah yeah!
Really nice day Really nice day
Look out!
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
Yes!
Did y'all see that?
Check this!
Go, Blag!
Go, Blag!
Go, Blag!
Hey, Blag.
- No parking' on the dance floor.
- Parkin'?
Dad?
Make some room there, big guy!
Really nice day Really, really nice day
Yeah!
Pretty crazy, right?
Pretty wild!
Well, technically, it...
It's awesome.
Yes, right.
- I was just gonna say that.
- Come on!
Everyone!
This is gonna be a long ride home.
I'm havin' a
Really nice day Really nice day, really nice day
- I'm having a
- I'm so cuddly, I like you
G'day
What are you doing this for?
What, do you think it's funny?
Just get out.
Sorry about that, everybody.
Sorry.
Hello.
Do carry on.
Come on!
All right, everybody exit in an orderly...
All right, single file!
Keep it...
I seem to do a lot of falling and screaming in this adventure.
[male voice] So there I was, face to face with the biggest, meanest leopard on this side of the Serengeti.
And... [young male voice] You roared so loud, his spots flew clean off.
Dad, I've heard this like a billion times.
[male voice] Do you know the one where I made the laughing hyenas... [young male voice] Cry'?
Yep.
- The croc attack?
- Dad.
OK.
Think.
Yeah, you do that. [chuckles]
All right, Mister Smart Guy, here's one I know you haven't heard.
It all started in the little place
I like to call the Wild.
They were the fastest wildebeests on the savannah.
We're talking fast.
All the other lions had given up the hunt hours ago, except your old man.
Fortunately, I knew a short cut.
[grunting]
Whoo-whoo!
I thought I had 'em.
Until the dust cleared.
Classic wildebeest trap.
[young lion] So, what did you do next?
- What did I do?
- Yeah.
That's when I gave them the roar.
[roaring]
[groans]
- [young lion] That's it?
- Hold on a sec.
I only thought it was over.
But they had a secret weapon.
He was the biggest wildebeest I've ever seen.
- He was 14 feet tall!
- Fourteen?
I meant 1,401 feet tall!
- [kissing] - [young lion] Cool.
And he had two...
No, four of the biggest horns I'd ever seen.
- Whoa!
- His breath was red hot!
I mean, green.
And he hated the environment.
To pull this off, I knew I was gonna have to dig deep, deeper than I ever had before.
So I swallowed my fear, sucked in the biggest breath I could.
[Young lion] Dad, I'm ready!
- You got it?
- I got it!
- I got it!
- Well, let him have it!
Roar, son!
[meowing, coughing]
[laughing]
[people laughing] [roaring]
- Uh-huh.
- [cheering]
- [cameras clicking] - [sighs]
Story of my life.
Your roar stops a herd of wildebeests.
Mine makes the babies laugh.
Hey, come on.
That was much better.
- [sighs]
- I'm serious!
It dropped half an octave.
[low voice] It dropped half an octave.
- [sniffs] - [chuckles]
And it sure scared me.
Made my hair stand up on end.
[blows]
- Yeah, right, Dad.
- [chuckles]
OK.
Let's take it from the top.
I'm done for today.
Come on, come on, one more.
You were so close.
- Maybe it's something technical.
- [sighs]
Maybe you're not opening your mouth wide enough.
Like this.
[muffled] Dad, thanks for the technical help, but if you wanted me to roar like you, you'd take me to the wild.
Whoa!
Hold on a second.
We've got everything we could ever want right here.
Great lifestyle, three squares a day.
And it's boring.
I'm never gonna learn how to roar here, Dad.
- Ryan.
- But don't worry.
I finally figured out how we can get to the wild.
You did?
The pigeons say those green boxes go there.
Those boxes are bad news.
Stay away.
- But, Dad...
- Listen, I know you're frustrated,
- but a lion finds his roar...
- [both] Here.
I'm...
I'm so tired of hearing that, Dad!
[woman screams]
It's a rat!
Get that rat off my baby!
A rat'?
- [baby cooing]
- Hello!
[baby] Silly, silly rat.
[shudders] Rats do not got bling like this.
[woman] You little...!
- Aaah!
- [gasps] [groans]
- [muttering] - [babbling]
Lastly, that is the ugliest baby I've ever seen!
Benny, stealing candy from a baby?
Stealing is such a strong word.
I prefer "liberating."
Uh-huh.
Hey, kid, heard the roar.
Down another...
- Octave.
- Octave!
[clicks tongue]
So you ready to cheer me and your old man as we capture our fifth straight turtle-curling title?
[karate yells]
- Hmm'?
- I can't even roar.
How would you even know I'm there?
So you really think it dropped an octave?
Absolutely.
Hmph.
What the heck is an octave?
- [sighs] - [young lion] I heard that.
- Mm...rabbit.
- [Benny] Mm.
Cholesterol.
I'll stick with the nuts. [grunts]
I don't know what his problem is, Benny.
He's 11, but he's still roaring at a nine-year-old level.
Little help here, Sammy?
You know what?
Maybe you're setting the bar too high, um, with all those stories about Samson the Wild.
Hey, he's always loved those stories!
They inspire him.
OK, OK.
I'm not gonna argue with someone who can use my tail as dental floss.
Sammy, you got something right there.
- Where?
- No, no, other side.
- Here'?
- Oh, uh... [stammering]
- Oh, sorry, Benny.
- You got it.
[announcer] Attention, friends.

Nigel, the "I-Like-You" Koala.
[man] Look, honey!
The crazy thing talks!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
[announcer] That's right.
He's so cuddly.
And better yet, he likes you.
[whistling]
Finally.
And the zoo will officially be ours in T-minus three two and showtime!
- [trumpeting]
- Wha-ahh!
Here I come!
Hey!
Who put that bar there?
[I Big Bad Voodoo Daddy:
Big Time Boppin' (Go Man Go)] [laughing]
That tickles!
Hey!
- Did too!
- Did not!
- Did too!
- Did not!
Out of my way, ya bum!
There's that moth-eaten koala!
I've told you flamingos a hundred times, walk.
- How about an autograph?
!
- Don't... [flamingo] Birds!
Find the string on his back!
So you're havin' a really nice day!
' Guys " Huh?
Off my co-captain, now.
- Eh, sorry, Samson.
- [grunts]
- Yah!
- OW!
That didn't hurt.
- [chuckles]
- I almost forgot to tell you.
I'm gonna ask Bridget out finally.
Slow down, Romeo.
You are a squirrel, and she is...
Perfect, right?
Look, I know what you're sayin'.
Believe me, I got my eyes wide open.
Hey, watch where you're goin', you big, big...!
[stammering]
[I Minnie Riperton:
Lovin' You]
Bridget.
Don't stare at my spots, Benny.
My eyes are up here.
[pants] Oh!
Oh, of course.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, oh, this, this is for you, honey.
It goes around your left hoof.
Did you get that out of the trash?
Oh, you did!
You little trash-picker!
I'm not a "trash-picker." I'm a recycler.
That's a lot more romantic.
Isn't it?
- Romantic'?
- Sam, come here.
Romantic?
Oh, don't mention romance to me, Benny.
- I've never had a boyfriend.
- Great!
That settles it.
I accept the job...
of boyfriend number one.
Benny, only the female orb-weaver spider will date a male one-twentieth her size.
- So there's hope!
- And then she eats him.
Huh?
[groans]
But at least he dies happy.
[I Big Bad Voodoo Daddy:
Big Time Boppin' (Go Man Go)] [both] Let's get Ryan, dude!
Dude!
We said that at the same time!
Dude.
[humming]
Hey!
Hey, Ryan.
- [sighs]
- Listen, I'm headin' down to the game.
I'm gonna see you there, right?
Come on, Ryan.
We need you.
You're our biggest fan.
[male voice] Yo, Samson!
Ha!
I'm your number one fan, man!
Whoo!
- Whoo!
- Thanks, man.
Right back at ya!
You were saying, Dad'?
Ryan, listen.
About this afternoon, I was just trying...
Dad, fine.
I'll go to your game, all right?
OK.
I'll, uh...
see you there, then.
[Yawns]
Uh...
Huh?
Come on, dude.
Psst!
- Dude.
- Guess who's here?
Eze.
Duke.
Man, he always guesses.
[chuckles] We're gonna stalk the gazelles while everybody's at the game.
- You in'?
- [chuckles]
- [Duke chuckles] - [Eze] Let's go, bro!
- Hmm.
- [Duke] The Ryanator.
I'm comm' down.
Fish heads!
Get your ice-cold fish heads!
Fish heads!
Get your ice-cold fish heads!
Now eyeball-free!
We're into the final period of the curling championships, and the penguins are up.
Here comes Victor.
[grunting] [penguin MC] What a beauty!
Yeah, sweep!
It's heading straight for the red bull's-eye!
This could be it, folks!
' Yes!
-
- Oh, yeah!
- That's gonna be tough to beat.
What? "Tough to beat?"
That's just the way we like it, right, guys?
_ [penguins Chanting] 'Hmm?
I can't believe this!
If we lose, I'm gonna rip my head off!
- [chuckling]
- And yours!
We cannot lose to flightless birds!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No one is losing anything around here.
As long as we stay focused.
By the way, has anyone seen Ryan?
Oh!
Oh, I know!
Maybe he's sulking 'cause he lives in his father's shadow and he roars like a schoolgirl.
- Thanks, Lav.
- You betcha!
' Nigel!
Nigel!
" [groans]
- Will you sign my dolly?
- [sighs] Not again.
[Samson] Nigel, ignore them.
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
You're so cuddly!
We love you!
[giggling]
That's it!
I am not cuddly!
I'm a vicious jungle animal from the streets of London!
- Fear me!
Ha!
- Get him!
Get him!
Get him!
Ow!
Help me!
Girls!
Put him down.
I am not a doll!
- Cushy tushy!
- Ahh!
Leave my bum alone!
Nigel!
Get your paws off my girlfriend!
Benny, I am not your girlfriend!
[yells]
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Ow!
Ow!
- Really nice day!
What is up with Samson's team tonight?
Brutal!
Benny?
Benny, Benny, Benny, Benny!
Oh, my gosh!
Who knows mouth-to-mouth?
!
I do!
[kissing] [groaning] What was that'?
Just your daily dose of vitamin Benny, baby.
- Get off my nose.
- I'm so cuddly, I like you!
- Stop saying that!
- G'day, mate!
Cannonball!
[Benny] Whoa!
Next year, I should just coach.
Check it.
The Thomson gazelle.
Zero to 5O in four-point-five seconds.
The ultimate fleeing machine.
There is no substitute.
Let's get a closer look at these slim jims.
- Shall we?
- I think we shall.
Maybe we should just go to the game.
I thought you wanted to be wild.
I bet your dad chased gazelles.
Yeah, if he were our age, he would so be rockin' out with us.
He'd be in there, runnin' 'em down like they were...
- Were...
- Gazelles.
Yeah, gazelles or somethin'.
Ready, man?
We'd better not.
Oh, yeah?
Are you gonna stop us?
- Guys, guys.
Huh?
' [E26] Here we go!
[penguin MC] The whole series comes down to this throw!
There's no tomorrow!
It's do or die!
Ya know what I mean.
Guys, guys, I know we're down, but we're gonna pull this out 'cause we're gonna use the secret play.
The secret play.
Hey, everybody, guess what?
We're gonna use the secret play!
Larry, the first part of the secret play is keeping it secret.
- [Larry] OK.
- Follow my lead.
I'm going to need a double effort from everybody.
Absolutely, captain.
Triple effort if you want, sir.
- Good.
Ready, and...
- [all] Break!
[Eze] Shh!
Quiet.
On three, dude.
One, two...
No!
[yowls] [meows] [chuckling]
- Uh-oh.
- [rumbling]
- Now you did it, Ryan.
- [gasps]
Feelin' mean, Donald?
Bring it on!
Folks, there's pressure on the big guy!
- Ready, Bridget'?
- Ready.
' Ready, Benny?
- Ready!
Hey, Samson.
It's a shame your little brat isn't here to see you lose. [laughs] [growls]
I can't hold it!
[penguin MC] Oh, no!
What are you doin'?
!
Whoa!
And here comes Samson.
Look at that guy.
Is he a beauty or what?
Larry!
Bridget!
Sweep!
What a recovery!
He's sendin' in Bridget and Larry to do the job!
Sweep faster, Larry!
Sweep, sweep, sweep!
- I am!
- Come on, man!
Team Penguin is sending their ace, Victor, to...
- Watch it, Victor!
- Nyah, watch it yourself, see?
Nigel, how are we looking?
Oh, no!
This could be trouble, folks!
This is cheating, and you will die for this.
I can't hear you, Nigel.
- Move left a bit...
- Kee-yah!
- Ow!
[groans] - [Larry] OK
Move left and hit!
- Larry, no!
- Tally ho!
[penguin MC] Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What a move!
Oh!
Folks, we are inches away from the greatest upset in turtle-curling history!
- Oh, no!
I can't believe my eyes!
- No!
Looks like Samson might have choked!
[grunting, farts]
- Nice!
- Yes!
- Unbelievable!
- [booing]
Samson and his team have clinched the title!
- [rumbling]
- No, wait!
What the heck?
The penguins have done it!
They're zoo champs for the first time!
Stampede'?
Stampede!
Please!
Stop!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, watch out!
[groans, gasps] [nervous chuckle]
- [gasps]
- Dude.
Busted.
[Eze] Catastrophic.
Told you I'd come to the game.
[chuckles]
You think this is funny'?
You just endangered everyone in the zoo!
- I'm sorry.
- For what?
Chasing the gazelles or costing us the game?
All you do is sit in your tree and sulk.
- If you would just...
- What's the problem?
Is all this because you can't roar?
Ryan, I didn't mean that.
You know what I'm doing when I'm sulking up in my tree?
I'm thinking how great it would be if Samson the Wild wasn't my father.
Huh?
Ryan, I...
I didn't...
'Cause it would make being Ryan the Lame a whole lot easier.
Ryan, I'm sorry.
Ryan!
Please don't...
"leave.
Bye, Ryan!
Thanks for coming to the game.
And you were worried he wouldn't show up.
[sighs]
Mm-mmm, mm-mmm.
Not good.
Mm-mmm, mm-mmm.
Not good.
No one listens to the squirrel.
[sighs]
I don't know what to do anymore, Benny.
I've tried everything.
Everything?
You tried everything?
What are you saying'?
I'm saying you have to tell him the truth.
I don't think I could do that, Benny.
I mean...
What's he gonna think of me when he finds out?
I don't know.
But if you don't tell him you're gonna lose him, Sammy.
[I Lifehouse:
Good Enough]
[growling]
[Ryan] The green boxes.
- [rumbling] - [man] OK, they're all loaded up!
- You don't think I know?
- Let's get movin'!
I change my mind!
I don't wanna go!
Help!
- Ryan.
- [truck engine starts]
Help me!
Watch out!
- Whoa!
[grunts] Sam!
- Hey!
Hey, hey!
- Wait for us!
- Dad!
" Ryan!
_
Don't let them take me!
_ " Ryan!
Help!
" No!
Ryan!
Benny, we need that truck followed.
Check.
Get me... the pigeons.
[rattling]
Aaahh!
I am wanting snake eyes!
Come on, baby. [blows]
- [yells]
- Come on, just throw it.
[pigeons singing in Hindustani]
Ohhh!
[grunts] Thanks.
Ohh!
Hamir!
You are the great loser of all time!
- Huh?
- What offerings must I make, I wonder?
Hamir!
Hamir!
Get a grip on yourself!
[screams]
Benny!
I am needing till Friday before I am paying you back!
No, no.
It's Ryan.
- [gasps]
- We've got to find him!
That is not good!
Not good at all!
Aahh!
I know!
I know!
I am telling him, you crazy pigeon!
[sighs]
The green boxes go to the big water where stiff lady with spikes on her head...
- Hamir'?
I can't understand...
- Spikes!
Just tell me where the green boxes go.
Stiff lady, spikies.
Yes, like my wife says the truck takes them to her!
To her!
Though I hate telling bad news, there is more bad news to tell.
When the sun rises, the green boxes leave on boat-boat and never return!
I am sorry for this.
I really am.
Hello?
[yells]
[Benny] Oh, not good.
Not good.
[Bridget] Pfft.
You always say that.
I keep on sayin' it.
No one's listenin'.
Like a broken record here.
OK.
When do we leave, Sammy?
Yeah, when do we leave'?
It's not "we." It's me.
Let's make this clear.
This is now a rescue mission, and I am the only one going.
We'll come too!
We're not afraid.
Are we, guys?
"Afraid?" [chuckling] No.
You know koalas.
More like "scared of things."
- Ryan's like a cub to all of us.
- Mm-hmm.
Not that I'll have one of my own at this rate.
You know, there's that famous...
A koala once said,
"We will fight them...
with peaches."
Yeah.
Anyway.
So we're helping, whatever it takes.
You want to leave with me?
OK.
If you don't mind being hunted down,
- shot at...
- Oww!
- ...stuffed...
- OK!
...or worse, then fine.
I have a recurring nightmare about taxidermy and spot remover.
Well, they have to catch us before they can stuff us, and I'm fast.
Nobody's leaving but me.
Got it?
- OK, you're the boss.
- You bet.
- You got the big hair.
- Absolutely.
[Benny] That's good, Sammy.
Hey, way to weed out the weak links.
All right, now that they're out of the picture, what's the plan?
Don't worry about a thing, big guy.
I got it all taken care of.
I know this city like the back of my paw.
We ditch this truck at Fifth Avenue, couple lefts, couple rights, bada-boom, past Broadway and...
Aaah!
You're there!
' - [gasps]
What are you doing here?
!
- Bleer blying blelloo Bly...
- What?
We're going to help you find Ryan!
She said, "We're gonna help you find Ryan."
- Oh, great.
- Hey, guys.
I've got popcorn up my bum.
Do I look trashy in this?
Ahh!
OK, here's my...
Here's my overall plan.
Where are we going?
I only have until sunrise before Ryan is taken away forever!
And now I have to worry about you three?
[sighs] All right, fine.
When do we get off of this thing, Benny?
- [flapping] Benny's here?
!
- Yeah, he's right there.
Benny?
Benny!
[sighs]
Great.
Now what am I gonna do?
Guys!
Guys!
I think we should duck!
What is she saying'?
She said, "Duck down!"
- Duck!
- [groans]
[Bridget] Hey!
I am not in the mood for a game of footsie or hoofsie or pawsie or...
[Nigel] That wasn't my paw.
It was this!
I didn't steal it.
I borrowed it.
It'll light the way to Ryan.
[I Coldplay:
Clocks]
whoops!
Ahh.
[screaming]
Whoa.
The walls are moving.
Oh, right, right.
The walls...
The walls are moving!
Larry, uh, hold your breath!
[gasps]
- [Bridget] Larry, stay straight!
- [grunting]
Everybody out!
All right, don't panic.
What we've got to do... [yells]
Oh!
This is definitely not good.
Samson!
Give me your hoof!
Help!
Larry!
Aah!
The garbage!
It lives!
~ [yells] _ [engine Sbwing]
Guys?
OK, anybody'?
I'm freakin' out.
- What's the hold up'?
- [muffled] Hello'?
We're over here, Nigel.
[muffled] I'll be there in a minute.
Think.
What did Benny say?
Couple of lefts, couple of rights.
[sighs]
Bridget, can you see the green lady?
I'm looking, I'm looking, but I can't see over anything for a change.
How far are you away?
You in a different continent?
Ow!
Is that you, Larry?
Up here, Nige.
You're a very furry snake.
Guys, shh.
We don't want to draw attention to ourselves.
' [grunts] ' [dogs barking]
Oh, dogs.
This should be fun for you, Samson.
Nigel!
Grab Bridget!
- What?
- Run!
[groaning]
I'm gonna throw up!
I'm gonna throw up!
Not to nitpick, but shouldn't you be tearing them to shreds?
All part of the plan.
This maneuver's known as the Serengeti Slip.
Page ten of the Predator's Playbook.
- Whoa!
- Wow!
[Bridget] What next'?
Uh, page 11?
Go on, you mutts!
Stupid dogs, we could've taken you.
Taken you to a... to a disco!
[hums] Larry, improvise!
[imitates barking]
- Larry, that's not helping.
- [Larry] OK.
Oh, you dogs think you got bark?
Well, Samson's got roar!
- Show 'em, Sam.
- Dig deep, Samson.
You're a lion.
Be a lion.
[growling]
Eeesh!
Look at that guy!
Sam, they are frothing at the mouth.
OK, uh...
- Larry, coil!
- Check!
- [veins]
- Whoa!
- Sam!
- I improvised.
Nowjump!
- Down there?
- Yes!
Whoa!
Whaahhh!
We're leaving, Larry!
Whoa!
Agh!
Uh-oh.
Teensy question, Samson.
With those dogs up there, why didn't you just do what you did in the wild'?
You know, lionize 'em or lionate them or lionify them?
I don't have time to fight dogs, Bridget.
We have to find Ryan, remember'?
Eww!
What is this stinky place?
- It, uh...
- Oi!
...appears to be a human bathing area.
You mean humans don't lick themselves clean?
Disgusting!
Oh, they're hopeless.
It is hard to believe they are the top of the food chain.
I can't imagine beginning the day without licking myself.
No hurry, but is there a plan?
[Samson] Of course there's a plan.
We follow this water to the big water,
- and then we find the lady with...
- [growling]
Larry, either your stomach is growling or something in your stomach is growling.
Wasn't me.
What?
- [gasps] - [Qrowung] [yelps]
Aah!
Ahh!
[Bridget] Oh, smooth move, Nigel!
Oh, boy!
Twins!
OK, Sammy, let's hurry it up now 'cause these guys are seeming to have acid reflux or something!
Everybody, uh, stay calm.
- Calm?
- [Nigel] Not good.
Uh...
Yo.
Boo!
' Aah!
' Aah!
I'm gonna say, it looks like you and your crew here are a little far from your borough.
[laughs]
Far from your borough!
Oh, I love it.
We're going to the big water.
Nigel, show them what we're looking for.
- Like this?
- I think it's in her right hand.
[sighs]
- And isn't she blue?
- I can't do blue.
No idea what he's talkin' about.
- Doesn't register.
- You're batting' zero.
Nigel, do the thing with... [sighs] Make your bloody mind up.
- Ahh!
"Uh!
The big female with the spikes on her melon!
They're tourists.
All right, tourists, listen up.
Ya gotta get to Battery Park.
First you take the Broadway culvert.
You're sending them down Broadway culvert?
- What's wrong with that'?
- They get lost at the sewage treatment plant!
- How would you send 'em?
- You're sendin' 'em the wrong way!
The Wall Street culvert is blocked with construction.
- That is true.
- All right, then.
Guys, you gonna help or not'?
Yeah, sure.
Of course we're gonna help yas.
We're one big family, right?
Except for that guy over there.
He scares the...
You done runnin' your mouth yet, Carmine?
Huh'?
Are ya?
Huh'?
Huh'?
I apologize.
He never got over being flushed down the toilet.
- Huh?
- Yeah.
Now, follow me because you four won't last ten minutes in this neighborhood.
It's a jungle down here.
- Stan, you know who that is?
- No.
That's one of them talkin' kawana bears!
Oh!
How ya doing?
"I'm so cuddly!
I like you!"
- [chuckling] _ [sighing]
I've seen a lot of those things floating' down here in the sewer.
[laughing]
That's good!
You're makin' me laugh over here.
Hey!
Just wait for me!
Hey!
Just wait for me!
Are we in the right place?
Any place without two hilarious alligators seems a move in the right direction.
Sam!
Do you see anything up there?
I sure do.
Well, well, well.
There she is, like Hamir said.
And it's sunrise, which means we're a tad short on time.
Guys, look.
We know the box Ryan's in is green.
It's gotta be around here somewhere, so I need you to...
Yeah.
So we should shout out if we see a box that looks exactly like the ones over there.
It hasn't left yet!
We can make it!
- Let's go!
- Hold on, Larry!
Whuh!
Oi!
- Which way now'?
- Yeah, which way?
[foghorn blowing]
- Run!
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
- Yagh!
- [foghorn blowing] - [Samson] No!
No!
Ryan's on that thing!
We've got to stop it!
- We can't, Sam!
- I don't care!
- No, Sammy, you'll drown!
- Sam!
I failed.
Again.
I only count one failure.
It's big, but it's just one.
Goodbye, Ryan.
We're gonna miss ya.
[engine turning over] [engine turning over]
Samson!
What on earth is going on?
It's a human, and I do not think he works for the zoo.
Perhaps now is a good time to "improvise."
What?
- [roaring] _ [yelling]
Great!
One problem down...
Far out.
Cool.
One disaster to go.
[engine revving]
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Larry, what are you doing?
We're headed for the other boat!
How do we steer'?
Who knows how to steer'?
None of us.
We're animals.
Great!
[screaming]
[signing] [screaming]
- Hold on, Larry.
Do that again.
- Do what?
Whatever you just did, but the opposite!
But I don't know my opposites!
No, Larry, like this!
Hey, I think I've got it.
Well, that was easy.
[chuckles] Oh, dear.
Has anyone got any eucalyptus wipes'?
Has anyone got any eucalyptus wipes'?
This isn't so difficult.
I'm the lion of the sea!
Arrgh!
[laughs]
Well done, sir.
Captain of our team and now captain of this vessel.
You're brilliant.
Um, I hate to be Miss Negative, but in this melee, we seem to have lost Ryan's boat.
What, nothing?
Nothing.
He's gone.
No.
There!
Nelson!
The green boxes!
- [Nelson] You're sure, eh?
- There's my buddies!
And my love!
Let's go in!
We'll head away from the sun.
No, towards the sun.
To the north.
Starboard...
leftboard.
Just follow my finger.
Oh, please.
You guys wouldn't know the answer if it fell from the sky and hit you in the head.
[groaning] Oh, my!
It's a bat!
It's a bat!
Get it off me!
Get it off me!
- Benny!
- Benny?
- Geese!
- [honking]
Are you all right?
Yes, my princess.
[chuckling]
Benny, you made it!
Oh.
You're my best friend.
Best friends should stick together.
Even not-so-best friends, who knock you off a speeding garbage truck.
Excuse me, but I begged them to go back and get you.
Just so you know.
Benny, could you see Ryan's boat from up there?
Well, it just so happens I saw it heading that way.
And we're in luck!
How's it goin', eh?
Canadian geese!
Experts at intercontinental travel.
Hey, birdie, OK, is it true that Canada has lax immigration policies for koalas?
I'll take it from here, Nige.
My son's out there.
We really need your help.
Can you lead us to that boat?
No problem, eh?
Just follow us, and Bob's your uncle.
Try not to lag too far behind, eh?
Hey, Benny, thanks.
- Ah.
- And FYI,
Bridget was very concerned when you fell off the truck.
Hmm.
Bet you didn't know I could ride geese, did you'?
- Bareback.
- Oh, brother.
Sammy?
We going to the wild now'?
I think we are, Larry.
[Benny] Yahoo!
[Larry] Yay!
[thunder crashing]
[panting]
[Nigel] I can't take it anymore.
He's taunting us!
Listen!
[laughing]
Stop laughing at us, you solar twit!
Captain Bligh, sir!
Are the ice cream cones ready?
The crew, they're on the verge of mutiny.
Nigel, please.
If you don't give us ice creams pretty quick, you're gonna walk the plank, sir!
- Nigel.
- I don't care if I drown,
I'm getting off this death cruise right now.
- Ahhh!
- Whoa!
Oooh!
Iceberg!
Permission to go down with the ship, sir.
[grunts] Hang on!
Stuff that!
Run!
Swim!
[yells]
Nigel?
Look, I'm a starfish. [chuckles]
Guys, look.
Gosh.
Must feel like a lifetime since you've been here.
Yeah... a lifetime.
What the heck?
Wow!
Look!
They're releasing the green boxes back into the wild.
- [Bridget] Larry.
- [Benny] Guys, they're putting animals inside the green boxes.
I just can't figure out why.
It's a tunnel to another dimension, can't you see?
- They go in...
- Uh, Sam, who is this guy?
It's all right, Nigel.
Hey, you think it has anything to do with that'?
- [Samson] Whoa.
- [Bridget] Hang on a second.
Either I'm starving or Larry is making sense.
You're right.
Those animals are being rescued.
[gasps]
- [shouting] - [trumpeting] [gasps]
[trumpets]
Ryan?
Ryan!
[trumpets] [panting] on, no!
Ryan!
We've got to move fast!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Ryan!
[panting]
Ryan!
Where are you, buddy'?
- Ryan!
I can't believe it!
- [pants] Samson!
- I was so close.
He was right there!
- Samson!
Whoa!
We'll never find him!
You know how big...
Will you get a hold of yourself'?
!
- Use your instincts.
- [sniffs]
I don't want to run anymore.
Good.
Quite frankly, you need a good sports bra.
- [sniffs] Ryan?
- Everything's under control.
- [sniffs] I got it.
- Temporary setback.
We lost him, but...
- I got Ryan's scent!
- He got it?
I mean, he got it!
Let's go!
- Hooray!
- Wait for us!
[sighs] I'm not designed for this!
I want a car.
[sniffing]
Hey, guys, I found him!
[sniffs] Ryan!
Aah!
Doesn't anyone knock anymore?
Hey, where's my son?
Did he come through here'?
Yeah, now that I think about it, he did come through here.
Hello?
Come on out, baby lion!
Your dad's here!
Well, what do you know?
There's a whole pride of lions down here!
Oof!
Eww, whew!
Funky.
I was under the impression you had Ryan's scent, not this olfactory insult.
I, uh...
I, uh...
I...
I had Ryan's scent.
But my predator instincts must've kicked in since, you know, I haven't eaten for a while.
Exactly!
You never know when those predator instincts are gonna kick in.
Excellent.
Fantastic!
We get to see the legend in action.
I'd love to, but we just don't have time.
Ho-ho!
We got the time, Sammy.
Just...
And then you do this.
And then this bit.
Hoo-hah!
Rip him apart!
[laughing] The horror.
[groaning]
Ohh, I can't bear to watch!
But I have to.
Go on.
Get out of here.
- The legend dropped his dinner.
- Oh, boy.
What's wrong'?
I'm not good enough for you to eat or something'?
No.
It's just I'm allergic to nuts.
Oh, now I get it.
You're gonna toy with me?
Beat me up a little, then pounce just when I get my hopes up'?
Oh, how exciting.
Come on, guys.
Ryan can't be far.
Hey!
I'm not finished with you!
I am a delicacy.
My flesh has fruity wood notes!
Watch it, little hors cf oeuvre.
That's Samson the Wild you're talkin' to.
You call this wild?
This is a cat!
A big, fat, tame pussycat!
- OK, that's enough!
- Ooh!
The pussycat hissed at me!
Maybe I should hide behind the koala for protection.
While we're at it, could you slap me in the face a few times'?
No.
What are you, a twit?
- Ignore him, Nigel.
- Don't bother!
I'm leaving.
- You're weird.
- Run for your lives, everyone!
It's a lion with moral issues!
[groans] And I've had it with you too!
Thanks a lot for wrecking my day!
Thanks a lot for wrecking my day!
Teensy question.
Uh, or more like a sort of a query meets a statement.
That hyrax back there?
It was sort of like you couldn't eat him.
Yeah, and what about back in the alleyway, those dogs'?
There was no munching there, either.
[Larry] If I didn't know any better,
- I'd almost say you're...
- A vegetarian?
Nope.
That's not what I was going to say.
- You were going to say...
- It's almost like...
- [all] You're not from...
- The wild?
Well, you're right.
I'm not from the wild.
_ [larry] What?
' [sighs]
I'm just a phony.
Truth is I can't protect you out here.
Please just go back to the boat.
I've got to find my son.
Tell me we're not in a dangerous jungle with an eight-inch squirrel protecting us.
Actually, I'm nine inches, but other than that, yes.
So that means... [pants] We are going to die!
[all screaming]
Hey, guys!
Guys!
[whistles]
Will the three of you calm down?
!
How could he lie to us'?
- We're his best friends.
- Sure.
Maybe he lied 'cause he didn't want to tell us the truth.
- Hmm.
- OK, yeah, whatever.
Whatever.
Let's just...
let's just go back to the boat then.
The fierce, the proud, the wild...
Rubbish!
But wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait!
Where you goin'?
Stop right there!
Stop!
Bridget, if you go, I'm, uh...
Whoa!
I'm breaking up with you.
We were never going out in the first place.
Then we're... taking a break.
- Nigel!
- All right!
Hey!
[groans]
hey= he)', hey, listen!
[babbling]
I know you're scared.
But at least we got each other.
Sammy's got nobody.
He's out there all alone.
And... so is Ryan.
OK, OK, focus, Samson.
He's got to be out there somewhere.
You'll find him.
I mean, how big can this place be, anyway?
[gasps]
Ryan!
[Pants]
- [giggling] " Huh?
[giggles] [hiccups 9i99le$]
Hey there, little fella.
You're lost too, huh?
Uh-huh.
You remind me of my buddy back home.
[screams]
Oh!
A bloodthirsty monster!
Where'?
!
Where'?
!
Where?
!
Oh, he's a killer!
Get away from my baby!
- Hey!
Hey!
- Yaah!
Calm down, lady!
Whoa!
Won't anyone save my baby?
- [shrieks]
- Bye-bye. [chuckles]
[Pants]
Ryan!
Ryan!
[Benny] Sammy!
I wasn't meant for the wild.
I was made to nibble and be elegant and to appear in children's books as the letter G.
Come on, this isn't scary, is it?
It's just leaves and vines and...
Ahh!
Oh, that's my foot.
- Nigel, keep a lookout back there.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You too, Larry!
- Okeydokey.
- Hmph.
- [Bridget] Oh, I see.
All right, OK, yeah.
You're giving me the silent treatment.
Like I care.
Nigel!
I gave you an order.
Would a little "sir, yes, sir" kill ya?
Nigel.
That's not funny, Nigel.
- He's gone!
We're doomed.
- Nigel!
First Ryan, then Samson, and now Nigel!
Oh, I do believe in zoos.
- Larry, you're tensing up!
- I do, I do, I do.
- Don't panic.
I'm in charge here.
- That's why we're panicking!
I say we fan out and circle.
What are we, peacocks?
We don't fan, we run.
Run for your lives, everybody!
Guys, I've got an idea.
Why don't we ask them?
Uh, it's OK, uh, they...
You see, they got, uh, hooves.
That means they don't hunt.
They graze.
[snarls]
But they're licking their chops.
I'll take the one with the funny knees.
The funny knee...?
Yaah!
Benny,n0!
[yelling] [groans, babbling]
Benny?
- Get them.
- [shrieking]
Just, hey, back off.
I'm sorry,
I'm not that kind of koala bear.
Huh?
!
What is it?
Ah, right.
Uh...
Aah!
Uh... [clears throat] Excuse me?
Hello?
Terribly sorry to bother you, but, um, do you speak koala?
Sprechen Sie koala?

Right. [gulps]
Could you possibly not go towards the big smoking thing?

I've had such a weird life!
This is not fair.
[yelps] [all chanting] Hee-um, hee-um...
Oh, I get it.
A yoga retreat.
Ryan!
You can do this.
Use your instincts.
[echoing voice] Follow your instincts.
Huh?
[sniffs] [voice] Follow your instincts.
[sniffs] Aahg [voice] Use your instincts.
OK.
[voice] Down this way.
[sniffs] Huh?
[voice] This way.
[panting]
[monkeys howling]
[both] Oooh!
A lion cub.
We must tell Kazar.
- It's my turn to tell him.
- You got to tell him last time.
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, yes, you did!
[shrieks] [shrieks]
Um, thank you very much, but, uh, I'm afraid I've got to run.
Koalas are very busy bees.
So if I could, I'll just buzz along to the door...
For centuries, we've watched our brethren perish at the claw of the lion.
Today, we put our hooves down.
No longer will we dwell at the bottom of the food chain.
[chuckling] Well, yes.
Uh, I should say so.
There were those who doubted you'd arrive to lead us.
But I always believed in the Omen.
Ah, the Omen!
Right.
Remind me again.
Sent down by the gods years ago...
Oh, no!
Not you!
[roaring]
[squeaks]
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
[screaming]
Oh, Great Him, you must lead us in our transformation from prey to predator.
- [snorting]
- Hold it.
I am the Great Him'?
- The Great Him'?
- Him.
Ha!
So this is all your fault!
That's it!
You ri...!
~ Uhh!
_ [caws] Kazarl
Kazar!
Don't listen to him!
- Kazar!
Over here!
- Kazar!
Over here!
How dare you interrupt my audience with the Great Him!
But...
But...
But we found a lion cub!
- You did?
- Was he with a big lion?
With big hair?
Well, a mullet, really.
Oh, Great Him, you brought two lions with you'?
Well, like any Great Him,
I travel with an entourage.
Oh, worry not, Your Himness,
I shall have Blag bring the lions here.
And he better not screw this up like he screwed up my dance number!
I lost count for one verse.
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
Aww!
Why do we even bother rehearsing?
!
[snorts] [grunts] Mm-hmm.
A good chorus line is so hard to put together.

Take to the skies!

We're taking!
Sheesh!

Yes, sir.
Bring us those lions!

We stamp our hooves in praise of the Great Him!

~ téRyam Van] No!
I'm coming, son!
- [roaring]
- Dad?
!
- Help!
- Let's scram!
- Ryan!
Oh, Ryan!
- Dad!
What are you doing here'?
- I can't believe it!
I found you.
- How'd you find me?
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
- Your paw.
- I got trapped in that green box.
- It's OK, son.
- And then I escaped,
- and I ran into the jungle.
- Ryan.
Those vultures came and tried to kill me.
- You wouldn't have been scared.
I was.
- Ryan.
I, uh...
- I have to tell you something.
- What?
- [rustling]
- Shh.
Listen.
- Get 'em, Dad!
- Run!
_ Huh?
' Run!
Dad, you should be chasing them!
Like you used to!
Those were just stories!
But now's your chance to show me for real!
This way!
[pants]
Dad'?
What's goin' on?
- Just get up into that tree!
- [grunts]
Whew!
I think we lost 'em.
What's the deal?
They're just a bunch of wimpy donkeys!
- Ryan.
- You could kick their rumps!
- Ryan, I can't fight them.
- You donkey-chickens!
Get back here!
Ryan!
I can't fight them.
What do you mean'?
[sighs] I was young still just a cub.
[man] Ladies and gentlemen.
Children of all ages.
- Samson!
- Huh?
Swallow that fear and stand tall!
Witness the greatest day in our young lion's life!
The day he discovers his roar!
Dad, I can't do it!
NOW, go!
[man] Listen as Samson unleashes a roar so mighty, it launches a wildebeest clear off the savannah!
[grunting, snorting]
Samson!
Dig deep!
[meows]
- [laughing] - [crowd laughing]
[Samson's father growls] I should have known.
If you'd been born in the wild, you'd know how to roar.
_ [e "_ Dad?
ngme Starting]
Dad!
Dad!
Please!
[crying] Dad.
[Samson] When they shipped me to the zoo,
I never wanted anyone to know where I came from.
Especially those closest to me.
I should have told you sooner.
But all those stories you tell?
I'm so sorry, Ryan.
Everything you told me was a lie'?
- [thump] - [gasps]
- Dad!
- Hang on, son.

Wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Hey!
Ow!
Get off me!
What is goin' on here?

Stinky does not speak.
It rolls like a little ball.
Wait, wait.
You guys think I'm a...?
- Achtung, Stinky!
- Less talk, more roll.
- Ja.
- Roll!
Roll!
What the...?
[grunts] Hey!
Rolling the dung is good for tight buns!
[chuckles]
I'll give you something to roll about!
[shudders]
It's a good thing Bridget didn't see that!
[gasps] Bridget'?
Larry!
They're gone.
I got to find them!
No!
No, no, I got to find Samson first!
No!
First...
Sam.
Sam!
[whimpering]
[snorting]
Bridget!
Larry!
Oh, Ryan!
You're alive!
Good to see you guys.
- Where's my hug?
- [choking] Larry.
- There it is.
- [straining] It's good to see you too.
What are you guys doing here'?
We came here with your father to find you.
And he's probably out there right now lookin' for us.
[sighs] I wish he were.
But some of these wildebeests pushed him off a cliff.
- What?
- What?
I don't think he made it.
I don't see how he could.
Oh, Ryan.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Kazar, I think you'll be very pleased with what I brought you.
What's this?
Where's the other lion?
Right.
Well, I was gonna tell you, there was this cliff and, uh... [snorting]
Why are you looking at me like that'?
That's twice you've been out of step today, Blag!
You klutz.
You know we can't ascend to the top of the food chain until we eat a lion!
Well, at least there'll be enough for my ascension.
What about the rest of us'?
Step-kick, pivot-kick!
- Whoo!
Uh!
Oh!
Ughh!
- [rattling]
- Ha ha!
- Ouch!
I twisted a hoof!
You work, and you work, and then they break your heart.
- [Blag] There goes my career!
- Prepare the sacrifices!
Why did I let him go off by himself'?
He couldn't catch a cold, much less his own lunch. [sobs]
Bet I could catch you.
Please. [sniffles]
My natural predator is fuel inject...
What'?
!
I knew you weren't really gone.
I knew it!
Come on, I knew it!
We're still buddies, right?
I lost Ryan.
There were too many.
They just took him.
Who?
Who took him?
Wildebeests.
The freaks with the hooves!
They got Larry and Bridget too.
Couldn't fight, couldn't... [groans]
Come on, Sam.
You're a lion.
You come from a long line of kings.
Yeah, maybe you're not from the wild.
But fighting's in your blood!
No.
I'll never be a real lion.
Wrong!
You are a real lion.
Doesn't matter where you're from:
Zoo, jungle, goldfish bowl.
It's what's in here.
That determines who you are!
At least, that's what you always told your son.
Now he's out there, Sammy, and he needs you.
Who else is gonna teach him how to roar?
That's it, Sammy.
[grunting]
That's it.
' [sighs] " [gasps]
Let's go find my son...
and my friends.
Yeah!
Nothing's gonna stop us!
Except that we have no idea where we're going!
[echoing voice] Follow your instincts.
- Follow your instincts.
- Whoa!
- What is that'?
!
- My, uh, instincts'?
- Benny?
- [voice] You're almost there.
- Huh?
- Well, that settles it, then.
My mother definitely drank pool water when she was pregnant with me.
Benny, look.
The freaks with hooves!
Ryan's in there.
Whoa!
Whoa!
You can't just barge in.
That's suicide!
Benny, get out of my way!
[voice] Don't listen to the rat.
Hey, who are you calling a rat'?
[voice 1] You, of course.
[voice 2] You'll give away our position.
I'll have you written up for that!
Fool!
You blew our cover!
Men!
Scatter!
- Not so fast!
- Ow.
Look who I got, Sammy.
It's your lion instincts.
Who are you guys?
- Our names aren't important.
- I'm Cloak.
He's Camo.
We're covert agents.
Ow!
Why've you been leading me around?
- That's classified.
Hush-hush.
- Top-secret.
- The wildebeests have gone mad.
Ow!
- Cloak.
It's not like I told them our plan is to use them to defeat Kazar's...
Listen, just tell me, did they take my son in there?
- That's need-to-know.
- They did.
And they think the koala's a god.
You're the worst covert agent ever!
Oh, yeah?
Then why can I do this?
Men!
Hey!
No!
Stop!
Sammy!
Idiot!
That maneuver's confidential.
It's secret.
This one's confidential.
- Cloak!
- And this one's restricted.
Super-secret.
Top-secret.
This is ultra-secret!
Enough!
No more!
Oh, show 'em the super-top-secret "no more"?
Gotcha!
[Came] No!
I got an idea.
Ch, who is this Great Him, anyway?
I'll take him on.
I'm the Great Her!
I'll show Him a thing or two.
I mean, I'm from New York City, for Pete's sake.
[gasps] on, my.
[wildebeests chanting]
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.
Nigel, I don't know what you're trying to pull,
- but I will kick your...
- Silence!
Ow!
Why, you little...
Ooh!
Silence, again!
You do not speak to me!
Nigel, what's the deal?
Great Him, shall we prepare the feast?
Yes, we shall!
Uh, what's on the menu?
Them.
[gasps]
Oh, no.
Eat friends and be god, don't eat friends...
God, friends, god, friends.
God...
- [crackling]
- That was subtle.
Prepare the meat fire!
- [gasp]
- Wait!
We cannot cook them without uh, onion!
[all chanting] Onions.
Onions.
Onions.
Well, that was fast.
Let the ritual begin.
[gasps]
Move it!
I am so mad at you!
- [chanting]
- Wait!
Well, we also need, uh, hats!
Do we not have the party hats of death?
I've got mine!
And before the feast, we must all...
Whaahhh!
What the...'?
- [gasping]
- Uhhh, levitate and spin uncontrollably!
And feel a bit sick.
Hoo-hoo!
How do I stop this thing?
- Guys.
- Benny?
- Look, a squirrel!
- Larry!
Shhh!
We've got a plan.
Follow me.
"We"?
I can fly!
Oh, Great Him, we are humbled by your power.
[Nigel] Be humbled.
Only the Great Him can do this!
- [hissing]
- Aaah!
- [coughing] Volcanic gas!
- Our cover's blown!
Major malfunction!
Abandon ship!
[all yelling]
[all gasping]
Oh, boy.
Well, 'bout time you got here.
Aw, Great Him, it's another miracle!
You've delivered us a real lion!
Blag, your luck has turned.
Thanks to the Great Him, we shall all ascend tonight.
Nigel, we've got to create a distraction.
Hang on a sec!
I've got miracles comin' out my ears!
Ready?
Stand back as the Great Me attacks the lion over 73 times my size!
Whoo!
Whoo!
[echoing] VVhoo!
VVhoo!
Dad?

My dad's alive!
Guys, my dad made it!
- Ryan, no!
- Hurry, I got to see him!
[yelling]
Ha-ha!
Whack, whack, whack, whack, whack!
' Dad!
_ What'?
Ryan'
- Aaah!
- [gasps]
[Nigel] I planned this.
- Ryan, no!
' [meows]
[Kazar laughing]
At long last, the cosmic balance has shifted.
- Stay close.
- Prey has become predator!
And predator has become prey!
And the hoof finally trumps the claw!
Come on, Dad!
Let's show these turkey-jerkies who's at the top of the food chain!
Let's eat the brat first.
- [gasps]
- Over my dead body!
[roaring]
[gasps] Yeah.
[Ryan] Dad!
He's gonna kill Samson if we don't do something!
Why don't we use the secret play'?
I know.
Shut up, Larry.
That's stupid.
No!
It's brilliant!
[grunting]
They laughed at me when I spoke of the Omen.
But look who's laughing now!
- Aaah!
- [gasps, pants]
- [grunting]
- Little to the left.
Yeah.
No!
Little to the right!
Next floor: bottom of the food chain!
Ding!
[laughing]
Fire!
[groans] [groans] [rumbling]
We got to find something bigger!
[clears throat] I know where we can find something bigger.
' Ready, Ryan?
- Dig deep!
You should have stayed at home.
Now our shrine will become your tomb.
[Benny] Fire!
[roaring]
Huh?
!
[Samson] Ryan!
_ Fgroans] Ryan!

I don't typically eat dessert before the main course!
- Get away from my son!
- Ooh!

Ryan.
[wildebeests snorting]
Ryan, are you still with me?
It's OK, Dad.
I just want you to know
I'm sorry you didn't have a father like the one I have.
Ryan.
Hmm.
- How touching.
- [growls]
But then, last words usually are.
- Finish them.
- [snarls]
- Huh?
- What are you doing?
I command you to attack them, like true predators!
We're tired of pretending to be something we're not.
But most of all, we're tired of you.
[squeaks]
Blag.
Fine.
I'll kill them myself!
[grunting]
- [roars]
- Dad.
Remember what you always told me in your stories:
Dig deep-
[grunts] [roaring]
Ohhh, yeah, baby!
[gasp] [roaring]
- [panting]
- Whoa.
[pants, grunts]
Let's go.
Yeah.
Come on, let's get out of here!
Come on, everyone!
Get out of here!
And for the record, I've always hated your choreography.
It's so... '80s.
That's right!
Run!
Run like the cowardly prey that you are!
I will hunt you down!
Everyone!
To the boat!
Top of the food chain, Ma!
Top of the food chain...
Aaaah!
Ow!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
- I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
- Uh-oh.
Hurry!
We're never gonna make it!
Push, you crazy, hairy monsters!
Push!
- Ahh!
- Whoa!
Larry!
Throw it in reverse!
Reverse throwing!
Whoa!
At least I saw the wild before it disappeared.
Whoa!
At least I saw the wild before it disappeared.
I can still see it.
It's right...
Here.
I found my roar.
We both did, son.
You know, Dad, this'll be our first story of Samson and Ryan the Wild.
I don't think anybody's gonna believe it.
[eruption]
Whoa!
Incoming!
Ow!

- [ratuing]
[Nigel] I seem to do a lot of falling and screaming in this adventure.
So there I was, face to face with the biggest, meanest leopard on this side of the Serengeti.
And...
You roared so loud, his spots flew clean off.
Dad, I've heard this like a billion times.
Do you know the one where I made the laughing hyenas...
Cry?
Yep.
- The croc attack?
- Dad.
OK.
Think.
Yeah, you do that.
All right, Mr. Smart Guy, here's one I know you haven't heard.
It all started in the little place I like to call the wild.
They were the fastest wildebeests on the savannah.
We're talking fast.
All the other lions had given up the hunt hours ago, except your old man.
Fortunately, I knew a short cut.
I thought I had 'em.
Until the dust cleared.
Classic wildebeest trap.
So, what did you do next?
- What did I do?
- Yeah.
That's when I gave them the roar.
- That's it?
- Hold on a sec.
I only thought it was over.
But they had a secret weapon.
He was the biggest wildebeest I've ever seen.
- He was 14 feet tall!
- Fourteen?
I meant 1,401 feet tall!
Cool.
And he had two...
No, four of the biggest horns I'd ever seen.
- Whoa!
- His breath was red hot!
I mean, green.
And he hated the environment.
To pull this off, I knew I was gonna have to dig deep, deeper than I ever had before.
So I swallowed my fear, sucked in the biggest breath I could.
Dad, I'm ready!
- You got it?
- I got it!
- I got it!
- Well, let him have it!
Roar, son!
Story of my life.
Your roar stops a herd of wildebeests.
Mine makes the babies laugh.
Hey, come on.
That was much better.
I'm serious!
It dropped half an octave.
It dropped half an octave.
And it sure scared me.
- Made my hair stand up on end.
- Yeah, right, Dad.
- OK.
Let's take it from the top.
- I'm done for today.
Come on, come on, one more.
You were so close.
Maybe it's something technical.
Maybe you're not opening your mouth wide enough.
Like this.
Dad, thanks for the technical help, but if you wanted me to roar like you, you'd take me to the wild.
Hold on a second.
We've got everything we could ever want here.
Great lifestyle, three squares a day.
- It's boring.
- Boring?
- I'll never learn how to roar here.
- Ryan.
But don't worry.
I finally figured out
- how we can get to the wild.
- You did?
The pigeons say those green boxes go there.
Those boxes are bad news.
Stay away.
- But, Dad...
- I know you're frustrated,
- but a lion finds his roar...
- Here.
I'm so tired of hearing that, Dad!
It's a rat!
Get that rat off my baby!
A rat?
Hello!
Silly, silly rat.
- Rats do not got bling like this, lady.
- You little...!
Lastly, that is the ugliest baby I've ever seen!
Benny, stealing candy from a baby?
Stealing is such a strong word.
I prefer "liberating."
Hey, kid, heard the roar.
Down another...
- Octave.
- Octave!
You ready to cheer me and your old man as we capture our fifth straight turtle-curling title?
I can't even roar.
How would you even know I'm there?
So, you really think it dropped an octave?
Absolutely.
- What the heck is an octave?
- I heard that.
- Rabbit.
- Cholesterol.
I'll stick with the nuts.
I don't know what his problem is, Benny.
He's 11, but he's still roaring at a nine-year-old level.
Little help here, Sammy?
You know what?
Maybe you're setting the bar too high, with all those stories about Samson the Wild.
Hey, he's always loved those stories!
They inspire him.
OK.
I'm not gonna argue with someone who can use my tail as dental floss.
- You got something right there.
- Where?
- No, no, other side.
- Here?
- Sorry, Benny.
- You got it.
Attention, friends.
Stop by the gift shop and get the most popular plush in America:
Nigel, the "I-Like-You" Koala.
- Look, honey!
The crazy thing talks!
- I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
That's right.
He's so cuddly.
And better yet, he likes you.
Finally.
And the zoo will officially be ours in T-minus three two and showtime!
Here I come!
Who put that bar there?
That tickles!
- Did too!
- Did not!
- Did too!
- Did not!
Out of my way, ya bum!
There's that moth-eaten koala!
I've told you flamingos a hundred times, walk.
- How about an autograph?
!
- Don't...
Birds!
Find the string on his back!
- So you're havin' a really nice day!
- Guys.
Off my co-captain, now.
Sorry, Samson.
That didn't hurt.
I almost forgot to tell you.
I'm gonna ask Bridget out finally.
Slow down, Romeo.
You are a squirrel and she is...
Perfect, right?
Look, I know what you're sayin'.
Believe me, I got my eyes wide open.
Watch where you're goin', you big...!
Bridget.
Don't stare at my spots, Benny.
My eyes are up here.
Of course.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, this is for you, honey.
It goes around your left hoof.
Did you get that out of the trash?
You did!
You trash-picker!
I'm not a trash-picker.
I'm a recycler.
That's a lot more romantic.
Isn't it?
- Romantic?
- Sam, come here.
Romantic?
Don't mention romance to me, Benny.
- I've never had a boyfriend.
- That settles it.
I accept the job...
of boyfriend number one.
Benny, only the female orb-weaver spider will date a male one-twentieth her size.
- So there's hope!
- And then she eats him.
But at least he dies happy.
Let's get Ryan, dude!
Dude!
We said that at the same time!
Dude.
Hey!
Hey, Ryan.
Listen, I'm headin' down to the game.
I'm gonna see you there, right?
Come on, Ryan.
We need you.
You're our biggest fan.
Yo, Samson!
I'm your number one fan, man!
Thanks, man.
Right back at ya!
You were saying, Dad?
Listen.
About this afternoon, I was just trying...
Dad, fine.
I'll go to your game, all right?
OK.
I'll... see you there, then.
Come on, dude.
- Dude.
- Guess who's here?
Eze.
Duke.
Man, he always guesses.
We're gonna stalk the gazelles while everybody's at the game.
- You in?
- Let's go, bro!
The Ryanator.
I'm comin' down.
Fish heads!
Get your ice-cold fish heads!
Now eyeball-free!
We're into the final period of the curling championships and the penguins are up.
Here comes Victor.
What a beauty!
Yeah, sweep!
Heading straight for the bull's-eye!
This could be it, folks!
- Bo-wango!
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah!
- That's gonna be tough to beat.
What? "Tough to beat"?
That's just the way we like it, right, guys?
I can't believe this!
If we lose, I'm gonna rip my head off!
And yours!
We cannot lose to flightless birds!
Whoa, whoa.
No one is losing anything around here.
As long as we stay focused.
- By the way, has anyone seen Ryan?
- Oh!
I know!
Maybe he's sulking 'cause he lives in his father's shadow and he roars like a schoolgirl.
- Thanks, Lar.
- You betcha!
Nigel!
Nigel!
Will you sign my dolly?
- Not again.
- Nigel, ignore them.
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
- You're so cuddly!
We love you!
- That's it!
I am not cuddly!
I'm a vicious jungle animal from the streets of London!
- Fear me!
- Get him!
Get him!
Get him!
- Help me!
- Girls!
Put him down.
I am not a doll!
- Cushy tushy!
- Leave my bum alone!
Nigel!
Get your paws off my girlfriend!
Benny, I am not your girlfriend!
Really nice day!
What is up with Samson's team tonight?
Brutal!
Benny?
Oh, my gosh!
Who knows mouth-to-mouth?
I do!
What was that?
Just your daily dose of vitamin Benny, baby.
- Get off my nose.
- I'm so cuddly, I like you!
- Stop saying that!
- G'day, mate!
Cannonball!
Next year, I should just coach.
Check it.
The Thomson gazelle.
Zero to 50 in four-point-five seconds.
- The ultimate fleeing machine.
- There is no substitute.
Let's get a closer look at these slim jims.
- Shall we?
- I think we shall.
Maybe we should just go to the game.
- I thought you wanted to be wild.
- Your dad chased gazelles.
Yeah, if he were our age, he would so be rockin' out with us.
He'd be in there, runnin' 'em down like they were...
- Gazelles.
- Yeah, gazelles or somethin'.
Ready, man?
We'd better not.
Oh, yeah?
Are you gonna stop us?
- Guys, guys.
- Here we go!
The whole series comes down to this throw!
There's no tomorrow!
It's do or die!
Ya know what I mean.
Guys, I know we're down, but we're gonna pull this out 'cause we're gonna use...
-...the secret play.
- The secret play!
Hey, everybody, guess what?
We're gonna use the secret play!
Larry, the first part of the secret play is keeping it secret.
- OK.
- Follow my lead.
I'm going to need a double effort from everybody.
Absolutely, captain.
Triple effort if you want, sir.
- Good.
Ready, and...
- Break!
Quiet.
On three, dude.
One, two...
No!
Now you did it, Ryan.
Feelin' mean, Donald?
Bring it on!
Folks, there's pressure on the big guy!
- Ready, Bridget?
- Ready.
- Ready, Benny?
- Ready!
Samson, it's a shame your little brat isn't here to see you lose.
I can't... hold it!
Oh, no!
What are you doin'?
And here comes Samson.
Look at that guy.
Is he a beauty or what?
Larry!
Bridget!
Sweep!
What a recovery!
He's sendin' in Bridget and Larry to do the job!
Sweep faster, Larry!
Sweep, sweep!
- I am!
- Come on, man!
Team Penguin is sending their ace, Victor...
- Watch it, Victor!
- Watch it yourself, see?
Nigel, how are we looking?
- This could be trouble, folks!
- Sweep, sweep, sweep.
This is cheating and you will die for this.
I can't hear you, Nigel.
Move left a bit...
OK.
Move left and hit!
- Larry, no!
- Tallyho!
What a move!
Folks, we are inches away from the greatest upset in turtle-curling history!
- Oh, no!
I can't believe my eyes!
- No!
Looks like Samson might have choked!
- Nice!
- Yes!
Unbelievable!
Samson and his team have clinched the title!
- No, wait!
I've called it too soon!
- What the heck?
The penguins have done it!
They're zoo champs for the first time!
Stampede?
Stampede!
Please!
Stop!
Watch out!
Dude.
Busted.
Catastrophic.
Told you I'd come to the game.
You think this is funny?
You just endangered everyone in the zoo!
- I'm sorry.
- For what?
Chasing the gazelles or costing us the game?
All you do is sit up in your tree and sulk.
- If you just...
- What's the problem?
Is all this because you can't roar?
Ryan, I didn't mean that.
Know what I'm doing when I'm sulking in my tree?
I'm thinking how great it would be if Samson the Wild wasn't my father.
Ryan, I didn't...
'Cause it would make being Ryan the Lame a lot easier.
Ryan, I'm sorry.
Ryan!
Please don't leave.
Bye, Ryan!
Thanks for coming to the game.
And you were worried he wouldn't show up.
Not good.
No one listens to the squirrel.
I don't know what to do anymore, Benny.
- I've tried everything.
- Everything?
- You tried everything?
- What are you saying?
I'm saying you have to tell him the truth.
I don't think I could do that, Benny.
I mean...
What's he gonna think of me when he finds out?
I don't know.
But if you don't tell him you're gonna lose him, Sammy.
The green boxes.
OK, they're all loaded up!
- You don't think I know that?
- Get movin'!
I changed my mind!
I don't wanna go!
Help!
Ryan.
Help me!
Watch out!
Sam!
- Wait for us!
- Dad!
- Ryan!
- Dad!
Don't let them take me!
- No!
- Ryan!
Help!
- No!
- Dad!
Help me!
Ryan!
- Benny, we need that truck followed.
- Check.
Get me... the pigeons.
I am wanting snake eyes!
Come on, baby.
Come on, just throw it.
Thanks.
Hamir!
You are the great loser of all time!
What offerings must I make, I wonder?
Hamir!
Hamir!
Get a grip on yourself!
Benny!
I am needing till Friday before I am paying you back!
No, no.
It's Ryan.
He's in one of those green boxes and they took it away!
We've got to find him!
That is not good!
Not good at all!
I know!
I know!
I am telling him, you crazy pigeon!
The green boxes go to the big water where stiff lady with spikes on her head...
- Hamir?
I can't understand...
- Spikes!
Just tell me where the green boxes go.
Stiff lady, spikies?
Yes, like my wife says, the truck takes them to her!
To her!
Though I hate telling bad news, there is more bad news to tell.
When the sun rises, the green boxes leave on boat-boat and never return!
I am sorry for this.
I really am.
Hello?
No.
Not good.
Not good.
You always say that.
I keep on sayin' it.
No one's listenin'.
Like a broken record here.
OK.
When do we leave, Sammy?
Yeah, when do we leave?
It's not "we." It's me.
Let's make this clear.
This is now a rescue mission and I am the only one going.
We'll come too!
We're not afraid.
Are we, guys?
Afraid?
No.
You know koalas.
More like "scared of things."
Ryan's like a cub to all of us.
Not that I'll ever have one of my own at this rate.
You know, there's that famous...
A koala once said,
"We will fight them... with peaches."
Yeah.
Anyway.
- So we're helping, whatever it takes.
- You want to leave with me?
OK.
If you don't mind being hunted down, shot at...
-...stuffed...
- OK!
...or worse, then fine.
I have a recurring nightmare about taxidermy and spot remover.
Well, they have to catch us before they can stuff us and I'm fast.
Nobody's leaving but me.
Got it?
- You're the boss.
- You bet.
- You got the big hair.
- Absolutely.
Yeah, that's good, Sammy.
Hey, way to weed out the weak links.
Now that they're out of the picture, what's the plan?
Don't worry about a thing, big guy.
I got it all taken care of.
I know this city like the back of my paw.
We ditch this truck at Fifth Avenue, couple lefts, couple rights, bada-boom, past Broadway and...
You're there!
What are you doing here?
- What?
- We're going to help you find Ryan!
She said, "We're gonna help you find Ryan."
- Oh, great.
- Hey, guys.
I've got popcorn up my bum.
Do I look trashy in this?
OK, here's my...
Here's my overall plan.
Where are we going?
I only have until sunrise before Ryan is taken away forever!
And now I have to worry about you three?
All right, fine.
When do we get off of this thing, Benny?
Benny's here?
Yeah, he's right there.
Benny?
Benny!
Great.
Now what am I gonna do?
Guys!
Guys!
I think we should duck!
What is she saying?
She said, "Duck down!"
Duck!
I am not in the mood for a game of footsie or hoofsie or pawsie or...
That wasn't my paw.
It was this!
I didn't steal it.
I borrowed it.
It'll light the way to Ryan.
The walls are moving.
Right, right.
The walls...
The walls are moving!
Larry, hold your breath!
Larry, stay straight!
Everybody out!
All right, don't panic.
What we've got to do...
This is definitely not good.
Samson!
- Give me your hoof!
- Help!
Larry!
The garbage!
It lives!
Guys?
OK, anybody?
I'm freakin' out.
- What's the hold up?
- Hello?
We're over here, Nigel.
Right.
I'll be there in a minute.
Think.
What did Benny say?
Couple of lefts, couple of rights.
Bridget, can you see the green lady?
I'm looking, I'm looking, but I can't see over anything for a change.
How far are you away?
You in a different continent?
Is that you, Larry?
Up here, Nige.
You're a very furry snake.
Guys...
We don't want to draw attention to ourselves.
Dogs.
This should be fun for you, Samson.
Nigel!
Grab Bridget!
- What?
- Run!
I'm gonna throw up!
I'm gonna throw up!
Shouldn't you be tearing them to shreds?
All part of the plan.
This maneuver's known as the Serengeti Slip.
Page ten of the Predator's Playbook.
What next?
Page 11?
Go on, you mutts!
Stupid dogs, we could've taken you.
Taken you to a...
To a disco!
Larry, improvise!
- Larry, that's not helping.
- OK.
You dogs think you got bark?
Well, Samson's got roar!
- Show 'em, Sam.
- Dig deep, Samson.
You're a lion.
Be a lion.
Look at that guy!
Sam, they are frothing at the mouth.
OK...
- Larry, coil!
- Check!
- Sam!
- I improvised.
Now jump!
- Down there?
- Yes!
We're leaving, Larry!
Teensy question, Samson.
With those dogs up there, why didn't you just do what you did in the wild?
You know, lionize 'em or lionate them or lionify them?
I don't have time to fight dogs, Bridget.
We have to find Ryan, remember?
What is this stinky place?
It appears to be a human bathing area.
You mean humans don't lick themselves clean?
Disgusting!
They're hopeless.
It is hard to believe they are at the top of the food chain.
I can't imagine beginning the day without licking myself.
No hurry, but is there a plan?
Of course there's a plan.
We follow this water to the big water, and then we find the lady with...
Larry, either your stomach is growling or something in it is growling.
Wasn't me.
What?
- Smooth move, Nigel!
- Oh, boy!
Twins!
OK, Sammy, hurry it up now, 'cause these guys are seeming to have acid reflux or something!
Everybody... stay calm.
- Calm?
- Not good.
Yo.
Boo!
I'm gonna say, it looks like you and your crew here are a little far from your borough.
Far from your borough!
I love it.
We're going to the big water.
Nigel, show them what we're looking for.
- Like this?
- I think it's in her right hand.
- And isn't she blue?
- I can't do blue.
- No idea.
You?
- Doesn't even register.
- You're batting' zero, kid.
- Do the thing with...
Make your bloody mind up.
The big female with the spikes on her melon!
They're tourists.
All right, tourists, listen up.
Ya gotta get to Battery Park.
First take the Broadway culvert.
- Down the Broadway culvert?
- What's wrong with that?
- They get lost at the sewage plant!
- Get outta here!
- What are you talking about?
- How would you send 'em?
You're sendin' 'em the wrong way!
The Wall Street culvert is blocked with construction.
- That is true.
- All right.
Guys, you gonna help or not?
Yeah, sure.
Of course we're gonna help ya's.
We're one big family, right?
Except for that guy there.
He scares the...
You done runnin' your mouth yet, Carmine?
Are ya?
I apologize.
He never got over being flushed down the toilet.
Yeah.
Follow me, 'cause you four won't last ten minutes in this neighborhood.
It's a jungle down here.
- Stan, you know who that is?
- What?
No.
That's one of them talkin' kawana bears!
How ya doing?
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I've seen a lot of those things floating' here in the sewer.
That's good!
You're makin' me laugh over here.
Just wait for me!
Are we in the right place?
Any place without two hilarious alligators seems a move in the right direction.
- Sam, do you see anything up there?
- I sure do.
Well, well, well.
There she is, like Hamir said.
And it's sunrise, which means we're a tad short on time.
Guys, look.
We know the box Ryan's in is green.
It's gotta be around here, so I need you to...
Yeah.
So we should shout out if we see a box that looks like the ones over there.
It hasn't left yet!
We can make it!
- Let's go!
- Hold on, Larry!
- Which way now?
- Yeah, which way?
Run!
No!
No!
Ryan's on that thing!
We've got to stop it!
- We can't, Sam!
- I don't care!
- No, Sammy, you'll drown!
- Sam!
I failed.
Again.
I only count one failure.
It's big, but it's just one.
Goodbye, Ryan.
We're gonna miss ya.
- Samson!
- What on earth is going on?
It's a human and I do not think he works for the zoo.
Perhaps now is a good time to improvise.
What?
Great!
One problem down...
Far out.
Cool.
One disaster to go.
What are you doing?
We're headed for the other boat!
How do we steer?
Who knows how to steer?
None of us.
We're animals.
Great!
- Hold on, Larry.
Do that again.
- Do what?
Whatever you just did, but the opposite!
But I don't know my opposites!
No, Larry, like this!
I think I've got it.
Well, that was easy.
Oh, dear.
Has anyone got any eucalyptus wipes?
This isn't so difficult.
I'm the lion of the sea!
Well done, sir.
Captain of our team and now captain of this vessel.
You're brilliant.
I hate to be Miss Negative, but in this melee, we seem to have lost Ryan's boat.
- What, nothing?
- Nothing.
He's gone.
No.
There!
Nelson!
The green boxes!
- You're sure, eh?
- And there's my buddies!
And my love!
Let's go in!
- We'll head away from the sun.
- No, towards the sun.
To the north.
Starboard...
Leftboard.
Just follow my finger.
Please.
You guys wouldn't know the answer if it fell from the sky and hit you in the head.
Oh, my!
It's a bat!
It's a bat!
Get it off me!
Get it off me!
- Benny!
- Benny?
Geese!
- Are you all right?
- Yes, my princess.
Benny, you made it!
You're my best friend.
Best friends should stick together.
Even not-so-best friends, who knock you off a speeding garbage truck.
Excuse me, but I begged them to go back and get you.
Just so you know.
Benny, could you see Ryan's boat from up there?
Well, it just so happens I saw it heading that way.
And we're in luck!
- How's it goin', eh?
- Canadian geese!
Experts at intercontinental travel.
Hey, birdie, OK, is it true that Canada has lax immigration policies for koalas?
I'll take it from here.
My son's out there.
We really need your help.
Can you lead us to that boat?
No problem, eh?
Just follow us and Bob's your uncle.
Try not to lag too far behind, eh?
Hey, Benny, thanks.
And fyi, Bridget was very concerned when you fell off the truck.
Bet you didn't know I could ride geese, did you?
- Bareback.
- Oh, brother.
Sammy?
We going to the wild now?
I think we are, Larry.
I can't take it anymore.
He's taunting us!
Listen!
Stop laughing at us, you solar twit!
Captain Bligh, sir!
Are the ice cream cones ready?
The crew, they're on the verge of mutiny.
Nigel, please.
If you don't give us ice creams pretty quick, you're gonna walk the plank, sir!
- Nigel.
- I don't care if I drown,
I'm getting off this death cruise right now.
Iceberg!
Permission to go down with the ship, sir.
Hang on!
Stuff that!
Run!
Swim!
Nigel?
Look, I'm a starfish.
Guys, look.
Gosh.
Must feel like a lifetime since you've been here.
Yeah... a lifetime.
What the heck?
Wow!
Look!
They're releasing the green boxes back into the wild.
- Larry.
- Guys, they're putting animals inside the green boxes.
I just can't figure out why.
It's a tunnel to another dimension, can't you see?
- They go in...
- Who is this guy?
It's all right, Nigel.
Think it has anything to do with that?
Hang on a second.
Either I'm starving or Larry is making sense.
You're right.
Those animals are being rescued.
Ryan?
Ryan!
Oh, no!
Ryan!
We've got to move fast!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Where are you, buddy?
Ryan!
- I can't believe it!
- Samson!
I was so close.
He was right there!
- We'll never find him now!
- Come here!
Will you get a hold of yourself?
Use your instincts.
I don't want to run anymore.
Good. 'Cause frankly, you need a good sports bra.
- Ryan?
- Everything's under control.
- Temporary setback.
- I got it.
- I got Ryan's scent!
- He got it?
I mean, he got it!
Let's go!
- Hooray!
- Wait for us!
I'm not designed for this!
I want a car.
Hey, guys, I found him!
Ryan!
Doesn't anyone knock anymore?
Where's my son?
Did he come through here?
Yeah, now that I think about it, he did come through here.
Hello?
Come on out, baby lion!
Your dad's here!
Well, what do you know?
There's a whole pride of lions here!
Funky.
I was under the impression you had Ryan's scent, not this olfactory insult.
I...
I had Ryan's scent, but my predator instincts must've kicked in since, you know, I haven't eaten for a while.
Exactly!
You never know when those instincts are gonna kick in.
Excellent.
Fantastic!
We get to see the legend in action.
I'd love to, but we just don't have time.
We got the time, Sammy.
Just...
And then you do this.
And then this bit.
Rip him apart!
The horror.
I can't bear to watch!
But I have to.
Go on.
Get out of here.
- The legend dropped his dinner.
- Oh, boy.
What's wrong?
I'm not good enough for you to eat?
No.
It's just I'm allergic to nuts.
Now I get it.
You're gonna toy with me?
Beat me up a little, then pounce when I get my hopes up?
How exciting.
Come on, guys.
Ryan can't be far.
Hey!
I'm not finished with you!
I am a delicacy.
My flesh has fruity wood notes!
Watch it, you little hors d'oeuvre.
That's Samson the Wild.
You call this wild?
This is a cat!
A big, fat, tame pussycat!
- OK, that's enough!
- The pussycat hissed at me!
Maybe I should hide behind the koala for protection.
While we're at it, could you slap me in the face?
No.
What are you, a twit?
- Ignore him.
- Don't bother!
I'm leaving.
- You're weird.
- Run for your lives!
It's a lion with moral issues!
And I've had it with you too!
Thanks a lot for wrecking my day!
Teensy question.
Or more like a...
a sort of a query meets a statement.
That hyrax back there?
It was sort of like you couldn't eat him.
Yeah, and what about those dogs?
There was no munching there, either.
If I didn't know any better, I'd say that you're...
- A vegetarian?
- Nope.
- That's not what I was going to say.
- You were going to say...
- It's almost like...
- You're not from...
The wild?
Well, you're right.
I'm not from the wild.
What?
I'm just a phony.
Truth is I can't protect you out here.
Please just go back to the boat.
I've got to find my son.
Tell me we're not in a dangerous jungle with an 8-inch squirrel protecting us.
Actually, I'm nine inches, but other than that, yes.
So that means...
We are going to die!
Hey, guys!
Guys!
Will the three of you calm down?
How could he lie to us?
- We're his best friends.
- Sure.
Maybe he lied 'cause he didn't want to tell us the truth.
OK, yeah, whatever.
Whatever.
Let's just go back to the boat, then.
The fierce, the proud, the wild...
Rubbish!
But wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait!
Where you goin'?
Stop right there!
Stop!
Bridget, if you go, I'm...
I'm breaking up with you.
We were never going out in the first place.
Then we're taking a break.
- Nigel!
- All right!
Hey, listen!
I know you're scared.
But at least we got each other.
Sammy's got nobody.
He's out there all alone.
And... so is Ryan.
OK, OK, focus, Samson.
He's got to be out there somewhere.
You'll find him.
I mean, how big can this place be, anyway?
Ryan!
Hey there, little fella.
You're lost too, huh?
You remind me of my buddy back home.
A bloodthirsty monster!
Where?
Where?
He's a killer!
Get away from my baby!
Calm down, lady!
Won't anyone save my baby?
Bye-bye.
Ryan!
Ryan!
Sammy!
I wasn't meant for the wild.
I was made to nibble and be elegant and to appear in children's books as the letter G.
Come on, this isn't scary, is it?
It's just leaves and vines and...
Oh, that's my foot.
Nigel, keep a lookout back there.
- You too, Larry!
- Okeydokey.
Oh, I see.
All right, OK, yeah.
You're giving me the silent treatment.
Like I care.
Nigel!
I gave you an order.
Would a little "Sir, yes, sir!" kill ya?
Nigel.
That's not funny, Nigel.
- He's gone!
We're doomed.
- Nigel!
First Ryan, then Samson, and now Nigel!
I do believe in zoos.
- Larry, you're tensing up!
- I do, I do, I do.
- Don't panic.
I'm in charge.
- That's why we're panicking!
I say we fan out and circle.
What are we, peacocks?
We don't fan, we run.
Run for your lives, everybody!
Guys, I've got an idea.
Why don't we ask them?
It's OK...
They, you see, they got hooves.
That means they don't hunt.
They graze.
But they're licking their chops.
I'll take the one with the funny knees.
The funny knee...?
Benny, no!
Benny?
Get them.
Just, hey, back off.
I'm sorry,
I'm not that kind of koala bear.
Right.
Excuse me?
Hello?
Terribly sorry to bother you, but do you speak koala?
Sprechen Sie koala?
Right.
Could you possibly not go towards the big smoking thing?
G'day, mate G'day, mate
G'day, mate G'day, mate
G'day, mate G'day, mate
What a strange place for a party.
Very good, very organized.
Can I use your toilet?
I'm having a
Really nice day Really nice day
Really nice day
I'm having a
Really nice day Really nice day
Really nice day
- Why don't you all
- Tickle away, tickle away
They're frighteningly horrible monster beasts but they're not bad dancers.
I'm so cuddly I like you
I'm so cuddly I like you
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
- I'm having a
- Really nice day
Oh, no!
Tickle away Tickle away
I'm so cuddly, I like you Good day
- What is that?
- I am Kazar.
Leader.
Prophet.
Choreographer.
And with your help... carnivore!
No!
Don't kill me!
I've had such a weird life!
This is not fair.
Oh, I get it.
A yoga retreat.
Ryan!
You can do this.
Use your instincts.
Follow your instincts.
Use your instincts.
OK.
Down this way.
This way.
A lion cub.
We must tell Kazar.
- It's my turn to tell him.
- You got to last time.
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!
Thank you very much, but I'm afraid I've got to run.
Koalas are very busy bees.
If I could...
I'll just buzz along to the door...
For centuries, we've watched our brethren perish at the claw of the lion.
Today, we put our hooves down.
No longer will we dwell at the bottom of the food chain.
Well, yes.
I should say so.
There were those who doubted that you'd arrive to lead us.
But I always believed in the Omen.
The Omen!
Right.
Remind me again?
Sent down by the gods years ago...
Oh, no!
Not you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
Oh, Great Him, you must lead us in our transformation from prey to predator.
Hold it.
I am the Great Him?
- The Great Him?
- Him.
So this is all your fault!
That's it!
You...!
- Kazar!
- Kazar!
Don't listen to him!
- Kazar!
Over here!
- Kazar!
Over here!
How dare you interrupt my audience with the Great Him!
But... but we found a lion cub!
- You did?
- Was he with a big lion?
With big hair?
Well, a mullet, really.
Oh, Great Him, you brought two lions with you?
Well, like any Great Him,
I travel with an entourage.
Worry not, Your Himness, I shall have Blag bring the lions here.
And he better not screw this up, like you screwed up my dance number!
I lost count for one verse.
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
Why do we even bother rehearsing?
A good chorus line is so hard to put together.
Take to the skies!
We're taking!
We're taking!
- Find them!
- Yes, sir.
Bring us those lions!
The gods celebrate the fulfillment of the prophecy.
We stamp our hooves in praise of the Great Him!
Holy moly!
Holy moly Holy moly
You are our king!
Looky, looky who's there.
Surprise!
No!
Sorry we're late for dinner!
That's pathetic!
Get off!
- That didn't hurt!
- Stop!
- Ryan!
- No!
I'm coming, son!
Dad?
- Help!
- Let's scram!
- Ryan!
- What are you doing here?
- I can't believe it!
I found you.
- How'd you find me?
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
- Your paw.
- I got trapped in that box.
It's OK, son.
And then I escaped, and I ran into the jungle then those vultures came and tried to kill me.
You wouldn't have been scared.
I was.
- I have to tell you something.
- What?
Listen.
- Get 'em, Dad!
- Run!
Run!
Dad, you should be chasing them!
- Like you used to!
- Those were just stories!
But now's your chance to show me for real!
This way!
- Dad?
What's goin' on?
- Just get up into that tree!
- I think we lost them.
- What's the deal?
They're just a bunch of wimpy donkeys!
You could kick their rumps!
- Ryan, I can't fight them.
- You donkey-chickens!
Get back here!
Ryan!
I can't fight them.
What do you mean?
I was young still just a cub.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Children of all ages.
Samson!
Swallow that fear and stand tall!
Witness the greatest day in our young lion's life!
The day he discovers his roar!
Dad, I can't do it!
Now, go!
Listen as Samson unleashes a roar so mighty, it launches a wildebeest clear off the savannah!
Samson!
Dig deep!
I should have known.
If you'd been born in the wild, you'd know how to roar.
Dad?
Dad!
Dad!
Please!
Dad.
When they shipped me to the zoo, I never wanted anyone to know where I came from.
Especially those closest to me.
I should have told you sooner.
But... all those stories you tell?
I'm so sorry, Ryan.
Everything you told me was a lie?
- Dad!
- Hang on, son.
Help!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Run!
Not so fast, Tigger.
Dad!
Ryan!
Dad!
- Help!
- Ryan.
Help!
Dad!
- Ryan.
- Dad!
Help me!
What?
Wait!
What?
What?
Wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Get off me!
What is goin' on here?
- Stinky does not speak.
- It rolls like a little ball.
Wait.
You guys think I'm a...?
- Achtung, Stinky!
- Less talk, more roll.
- Ja.
- Roll!
Roll!
What the...?
Hey!
Rolling the dung is good for tight buns!
I'll give you something to roll about!
It's a good thing Bridget didn't see that!
Bridget?
Larry!
They're gone.
I gotta find them!
No!
I gotta find Samson first!
No!
First...
Sam.
Sam!
Bridget!
Larry!
Oh, Ryan!
You're alive!
Good to see you guys.
- Where's my hug?
- Larry.
- There it is.
- It's good to see you too.
What are you guys doing here?
We came here with your father to find you.
And he's probably out there right now lookin' for us.
I wish he were.
But some of these wildebeests pushed him off a cliff.
- What?
- What?
I don't think he made it.
I don't see how he could.
Oh, Ryan.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Kazar, I think you'll be very pleased with what I brought you.
What's this?
Where's the other lion?
Right.
Well, I was gonna tell you, there was this cliff and...
Why are you looking at me like that?
That's twice you've been out of step today, Blag!
You klutz.
You know we can't ascend to the top of the food chain until we eat a lion!
Well, at least there'll be enough for my ascension.
What about the rest of us?
Step-kick, pivot-kick!
Ouch!
I twisted a hoof!
You work and you work.
Then they break your heart.
- There goes my career!
- Prepare the sacrifices!
Why did I let him go off by himself?
He couldn't catch a cold, much less his own lunch.
Bet I could catch you.
Please.
My natural predator is fuel inject...
What?
I knew you weren't really gone.
I knew it!
Come on, I knew it!
We're still buddies, right?
I lost Ryan.
There were too many.
They just took him.
Who?
Who took him?
- Wildebeests.
- The freaks with the hooves!
They got Larry and Bridget too.
Couldn't fight, couldn't...
Come on, Sam.
You're a lion.
You come from a long line of kings.
Yeah, maybe you're not from the wild.
But fighting's in your blood!
No.
I'll never be a real lion.
Wrong!
You are a real lion.
Doesn't matter where you're from:
Zoo, jungle, goldfish bowl.
It's what's in here.
That determines who you are!
At least, that's what you always told your son.
Now he's out there, Sammy, and he needs you.
Who else is gonna teach him how to roar?
That's it, Sammy.
That's it.
Let's go find my son...
and my friends.
Yeah!
Nothing's gonna stop us!
Except that we have no idea where we're going!
Follow your instincts.
Follow your instincts.
- What is that?
- My... instincts?
- Benny?
- You're almost there.
That settles it, then.
My mother definitely drank pool water when she was pregnant with me.
Benny, look.
The freaks with hooves!
Ryan's in there.
You can't just barge in.
That's suicide!
- Benny, get out of my way!
- Don't listen to the rat.
- Hey, who are you calling a rat?
- You, of course.
- You'll give away our position.
- I'll have you written up for that!
Fool!
You blew our cover!
Men!
Scatter!
Not so fast!
Look who I got, Sammy.
It's your lion instincts.
Who are you guys?
- Our names aren't important.
- I'm Cloak.
He's Camo.
- We're covert agents.
- Why have you been leading me around?
- That's classified.
- Top-secret.
- The wildebeests have gone mad.
- Cloak.
It's not like I told them our plan is to use them to defeat Kazar's...
Listen, just tell me, did they take my son in there?
- That's need-to-know.
- They did.
- They think the koala's a god.
- You're the worst covert agent!
Oh, yeah?
Then why can I do this?
Men!
Hey!
No!
Stop!
Sammy!
- Idiot!
That maneuver's confidential.
- It's secret.
This one's confidential.
- Cloak!
- And this one's restricted.
Super-secret.
Top-secret.
This is ultra-secret!
Enough!
No more!
Show 'em the super-top-secret "no more?" Gotcha!
No!
I got an idea.
Who is this Great Him, anyway?
I'll take him on.
I'm the Great Her!
I'll show Him a thing or two.
I'm from New York City, for Pete's sake.
Oh, my.
You have got to be kidding me.
Nigel, I don't know what you're trying to pull,
- but I will kick your...
- Silence!
Why, you little...
Silence, again!
You do not speak to me!
Nigel, what's the deal?
Great Him, shall we prepare the feast?
Yes, we shall!
What's on the menu?
Them.
Oh, no.
Eat friends and be god, don't eat friends...
God, friends, god, friends.
God, I...
Well, that was subtle.
Prepare the meat fire!
Wait!
We cannot cook them without onion!
Onions.
Onions.
Onions.
Well, that was fast.
Let the ritual begin.
Move it!
I am so mad at you!
Wait!
We also need... hats!
Do we not have the party hats of death?
I've got mine!
And before the feast, we must all...
What the...?
...levitate and spin uncontrollably!
And feel a bit sick.
How do I stop this thing?
- Guys.
- Benny?
- Look, a squirrel!
- Larry!
We've got a plan.
Follow me.
- We?
- I can fly!
Oh, Great Him, we are humbled by your power.
Be humbled.
Only the Great Him can do this!
- Volcanic gas!
- Our cover's blown!
Major malfunction!
Abandon ship!
- Oh, boy.
- Well, about time you got here.
Great Him, it's another miracle!
You've delivered us a real lion!
Blag, your luck has turned.
Thanks to the Great Him, we shall all ascend tonight.
Nigel, we've got to create a distraction.
Hang on a sec!
I've got miracles comin' out my ears!
Ready?
Stand back as the Great Me attacks the lion over 73 times my size!
Dad?
My dad's alive!
Guys, my dad made it!
- Ryan, no!
- Hurry, I got to see him!
Whack, whack, whack!
- Dad!
- What?
Ryan!
- I planned this.
- Ryan, no!
At long last, the cosmic balance has shifted.
- Stay close.
- Prey has become predator!
And predator has become prey!
And the hoof finally trumps the claw!
Come on, Dad!
Let's show these turkey-jerkies who's at the top of the food chain!
Let's eat the brat first.
Over my dead body!
Yeah.
Dad!
He's gonna kill Samson if we don't do something!
Why don't we use the secret play?
I know.
Shut up, Larry.
That's stupid.
No!
It's brilliant!
They laughed at me when I spoke of the Omen.
But look who's laughing now!
Little to the left.
Yeah.
No!
Little to the right!
Next floor: bottom of the food chain!
Ding!
Fire!
We gotta find something bigger!
I know where we can find something bigger.
- Ready, Ryan?
- Dig deep!
You should have stayed at home.
Now our shrine will become your tomb.
Fire!
Ryan!
Ryan!
I don't typically eat dessert before the main course!
Get away from my son!
Ryan.
Ryan, are you still with me?
It's OK, Dad.
I just want you to know
I'm sorry you didn't have a father like the one I have.
Ryan.
How touching.
But then, last words usually are.
Finish them.
What are you doing?
I command you to attack them, like true predators!
We're tired of pretending to be something we're not.
But most of all, we're tired of you.
Blag.
Fine.
I'll kill them myself!
Dad, remember what you always told me in your stories:
Dig deep.
Oh, yeah, baby!
Let's go.
Yeah.
- Come on, let's get out of here!
- Get out of here!
And for the record, I've always hated your choreography.
It's so... '80s.
That's right!
Run!
Run like the cowardly prey that you are!
I will hunt you down!
Everyone!
To the boat!
Top of the food chain, Ma!
Top of the food chain...
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
Hurry!
We're never gonna make it!
Push, you crazy, hairy monsters!
Push!
- Larry, throw it in reverse!
- Reverse throwing!
At least I saw the wild before it disappeared.
I can still see it.
It's right...
Here.
I found my roar.
We both did, son.
You know, Dad, this'll be our first story of Samson and Ryan the Wild.
I don't think anybody's gonna believe it.
Incoming!
I'm so cuddly!
Cuddly!
I'm so cuddly!
I know you're cuddly.
But can you float?
- I'm having a
- Really nice day
Really nice day Really nice day
Step-kick left!
Really nice day
Step-kick right!
- Splendid.
- No!
Smashing.
Hey!
- Stupendous!
- Are you guys sure about this?
Operation Snake-Over is now complete.
Hey, look, everyone!
I'm a secret agent!
Bridget, I get it.
You're more than a tall, lanky goddess.
You're a strong, independent female.
You don't need to be defined by your relationship
- and I, I respect that.
- It's about time.
What was that?
Just your daily dose of vitamin Bridget, baby.
Oh, yeah yeah!
Really nice day Really nice day
Look out!
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
Yes!
Did y'all see that?
Check this!
Go, Blag!
Go, Blag!
Go, Blag!
Hey, Blag.
- No parking' on the dance floor.
- Parkin'?
Dad?
Make some room there, big guy!
Really nice day Really, really nice day
Yeah!
Pretty crazy, right?
Pretty wild!
Well, technically, it...
It's awesome.
Yes, right.
- I was just gonna say that.
- Come on!
Everyone!
This is gonna be a long ride home.
I'm havin' a
Really nice day Really nice day, really nice day
- I'm having a
- I'm so cuddly, I like you
G'day
What are you doing this for?
What, do you think it's funny?
Just get out.
Sorry about that, everybody.
Sorry.
Hello.
Do carry on.
Come on!
All right, everybody exit in an orderly...
All right, single file!
Keep it...
I seem to do a lot of falling and screaming in this adventure.
So there I was, face to face with the biggest, meanest leopard on this side of the Serengeti.
And...
You roared so loud, his spots flew clean off.
Dad, I've heard this like a billion times.
Do you know the one where I made the laughing hyenas...
Cry?
Yep.
- The croc attack?
- Dad.
OK.
Think.
Yeah, you do that.
All right, Mr. Smart Guy, here's one I know you haven't heard.
It all started in the little place I like to call the wild.
They were the fastest wildebeests on the savannah.
We're talking fast.
All the other lions had given up the hunt hours ago, except your old man.
Fortunately, I knew a short cut.
I thought I had 'em.
Until the dust cleared.
Classic wildebeest trap.
So, what did you do next?
- What did I do?
- Yeah.
That's when I gave them the roar.
- That's it?
- Hold on a sec.
I only thought it was over.
But they had a secret weapon.
He was the biggest wildebeest I've ever seen.
- He was 14 feet tall!
- Fourteen?
I meant 1,401 feet tall!
Cool.
And he had two...
No, four of the biggest horns I'd ever seen.
- Whoa!
- His breath was red hot!
I mean, green.
And he hated the environment.
To pull this off, I knew I was gonna have to dig deep, deeper than I ever had before.
So I swallowed my fear, sucked in the biggest breath I could.
Dad, I'm ready!
- You got it?
- I got it!
- I got it!
- Well, let him have it!
Roar, son!
Story of my life.
Your roar stops a herd of wildebeests.
Mine makes the babies laugh.
Hey, come on.
That was much better.
I'm serious!
It dropped half an octave.
It dropped half an octave.
And it sure scared me.
- Made my hair stand up on end.
- Yeah, right, Dad.
- OK.
Let's take it from the top.
- I'm done for today.
Come on, come on, one more.
You were so close.
Maybe it's something technical.
Maybe you're not opening your mouth wide enough.
Like this.
Dad, thanks for the technical help, but if you wanted me to roar like you, you'd take me to the wild.
Hold on a second.
We've got everything we could ever want here.
Great lifestyle, three squares a day.
- It's boring.
- Boring?
- I'll never learn how to roar here.
- Ryan.
But don't worry.
I finally figured out
- how we can get to the wild.
- You did?
The pigeons say those green boxes go there.
Those boxes are bad news.
Stay away.
- But, Dad...
- I know you're frustrated,
- but a lion finds his roar...
- Here.
I'm so tired of hearing that, Dad!
It's a rat!
Get that rat off my baby!
A rat?
Hello!
Silly, silly rat.
- Rats do not got bling like this, lady.
- You little...!
Lastly, that is the ugliest baby I've ever seen!
Benny, stealing candy from a baby?
Stealing is such a strong word.
I prefer "liberating."
Hey, kid, heard the roar.
Down another...
- Octave.
- Octave!
You ready to cheer me and your old man as we capture our fifth straight turtle-curling title?
I can't even roar.
How would you even know I'm there?
So, you really think it dropped an octave?
Absolutely.
- What the heck is an octave?
- I heard that.
- Rabbit.
- Cholesterol.
I'll stick with the nuts.
I don't know what his problem is, Benny.
He's 11, but he's still roaring at a nine-year-old level.
Little help here, Sammy?
You know what?
Maybe you're setting the bar too high, with all those stories about Samson the Wild.
Hey, he's always loved those stories!
They inspire him.
OK.
I'm not gonna argue with someone who can use my tail as dental floss.
- You got something right there.
- Where?
- No, no, other side.
- Here?
- Sorry, Benny.
- You got it.
Attention, friends.
Stop by the gift shop and get the most popular plush in America:
Nigel, the "I-Like-You" Koala.
- Look, honey!
The crazy thing talks!
- I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
That's right.
He's so cuddly.
And better yet, he likes you.
Finally.
And the zoo will officially be ours in T-minus three two and showtime!
Here I come!
Who put that bar there?
That tickles!
- Did too!
- Did not!
- Did too!
- Did not!
Out of my way, ya bum!
There's that moth-eaten koala!
I've told you flamingos a hundred times, walk.
- How about an autograph?
!
- Don't...
Birds!
Find the string on his back!
- So you're havin' a really nice day!
- Guys.
Off my co-captain, now.
Sorry, Samson.
That didn't hurt.
I almost forgot to tell you.
I'm gonna ask Bridget out finally.
Slow down, Romeo.
You are a squirrel and she is...
Perfect, right?
Look, I know what you're sayin'.
Believe me, I got my eyes wide open.
Watch where you're goin', you big...!
Bridget.
Don't stare at my spots, Benny.
My eyes are up here.
Of course.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, this is for you, honey.
It goes around your left hoof.
Did you get that out of the trash?
You did!
You trash-picker!
I'm not a trash-picker.
I'm a recycler.
That's a lot more romantic.
Isn't it?
- Romantic?
- Sam, come here.
Romantic?
Don't mention romance to me, Benny.
- I've never had a boyfriend.
- That settles it.
I accept the job...
of boyfriend number one.
Benny, only the female orb-weaver spider will date a male one-twentieth her size.
- So there's hope!
- And then she eats him.
But at least he dies happy.
Let's get Ryan, dude!
Dude!
We said that at the same time!
Dude.
Hey!
Hey, Ryan.
Listen, I'm headin' down to the game.
I'm gonna see you there, right?
Come on, Ryan.
We need you.
You're our biggest fan.
Yo, Samson!
I'm your number one fan, man!
Thanks, man.
Right back at ya!
You were saying, Dad?
Listen.
About this afternoon, I was just trying...
Dad, fine.
I'll go to your game, all right?
OK.
I'll... see you there, then.
Come on, dude.
- Dude.
- Guess who's here?
Eze.
Duke.
Man, he always guesses.
We're gonna stalk the gazelles while everybody's at the game.
- You in?
- Let's go, bro!
The Ryanator.
I'm comin' down.
Fish heads!
Get your ice-cold fish heads!
Now eyeball-free!
We're into the final period of the curling championships and the penguins are up.
Here comes Victor.
What a beauty!
Yeah, sweep!
Heading straight for the bull's-eye!
This could be it, folks!
- Bo-wango!
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah!
- That's gonna be tough to beat.
What? "Tough to beat"?
That's just the way we like it, right, guys?
I can't believe this!
If we lose, I'm gonna rip my head off!
And yours!
We cannot lose to flightless birds!
Whoa, whoa.
No one is losing anything around here.
As long as we stay focused.
- By the way, has anyone seen Ryan?
- Oh!
I know!
Maybe he's sulking 'cause he lives in his father's shadow and he roars like a schoolgirl.
- Thanks, Lar.
- You betcha!
Nigel!
Nigel!
Will you sign my dolly?
- Not again.
- Nigel, ignore them.
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
- You're so cuddly!
We love you!
- That's it!
I am not cuddly!
I'm a vicious jungle animal from the streets of London!
- Fear me!
- Get him!
Get him!
Get him!
- Help me!
- Girls!
Put him down.
I am not a doll!
- Cushy tushy!
- Leave my bum alone!
Nigel!
Get your paws off my girlfriend!
Benny, I am not your girlfriend!
Really nice day!
What is up with Samson's team tonight?
Brutal!
Benny?
Oh, my gosh!
Who knows mouth-to-mouth?
I do!
What was that?
Just your daily dose of vitamin Benny, baby.
- Get off my nose.
- I'm so cuddly, I like you!
- Stop saying that!
- G'day, mate!
Cannonball!
Next year, I should just coach.
Check it.
The Thomson gazelle.
Zero to 50 in four-point-five seconds.
- The ultimate fleeing machine.
- There is no substitute.
Let's get a closer look at these slim jims.
- Shall we?
- I think we shall.
Maybe we should just go to the game.
- I thought you wanted to be wild.
- Your dad chased gazelles.
Yeah, if he were our age, he would so be rockin' out with us.
He'd be in there, runnin' 'em down like they were...
- Gazelles.
- Yeah, gazelles or somethin'.
Ready, man?
We'd better not.
Oh, yeah?
Are you gonna stop us?
- Guys, guys.
- Here we go!
The whole series comes down to this throw!
There's no tomorrow!
It's do or die!
Ya know what I mean.
Guys, I know we're down, but we're gonna pull this out 'cause we're gonna use...
-...the secret play.
- The secret play!
Hey, everybody, guess what?
We're gonna use the secret play!
Larry, the first part of the secret play is keeping it secret.
- OK.
- Follow my lead.
I'm going to need a double effort from everybody.
Absolutely, captain.
Triple effort if you want, sir.
- Good.
Ready, and...
- Break!
Quiet.
On three, dude.
One, two...
No!
Now you did it, Ryan.
Feelin' mean, Donald?
Bring it on!
Folks, there's pressure on the big guy!
- Ready, Bridget?
- Ready.
- Ready, Benny?
- Ready!
Samson, it's a shame your little brat isn't here to see you lose.
I can't... hold it!
Oh, no!
What are you doin'?
And here comes Samson.
Look at that guy.
Is he a beauty or what?
Larry!
Bridget!
Sweep!
What a recovery!
He's sendin' in Bridget and Larry to do the job!
Sweep faster, Larry!
Sweep, sweep!
- I am!
- Come on, man!
Team Penguin is sending their ace, Victor...
- Watch it, Victor!
- Watch it yourself, see?
Nigel, how are we looking?
- This could be trouble, folks!
- Sweep, sweep, sweep.
This is cheating and you will die for this.
I can't hear you, Nigel.
Move left a bit...
OK.
Move left and hit!
- Larry, no!
- Tallyho!
What a move!
Folks, we are inches away from the greatest upset in turtle-curling history!
- Oh, no!
I can't believe my eyes!
- No!
Looks like Samson might have choked!
- Nice!
- Yes!
Unbelievable!
Samson and his team have clinched the title!
- No, wait!
I've called it too soon!
- What the heck?
The penguins have done it!
They're zoo champs for the first time!
Stampede?
Stampede!
Please!
Stop!
Watch out!
Dude.
Busted.
Catastrophic.
Told you I'd come to the game.
You think this is funny?
You just endangered everyone in the zoo!
- I'm sorry.
- For what?
Chasing the gazelles or costing us the game?
All you do is sit up in your tree and sulk.
- If you just...
- What's the problem?
Is all this because you can't roar?
Ryan, I didn't mean that.
Know what I'm doing when I'm sulking in my tree?
I'm thinking how great it would be if Samson the Wild wasn't my father.
Ryan, I didn't...
'Cause it would make being Ryan the Lame a lot easier.
Ryan, I'm sorry.
Ryan!
Please don't leave.
Bye, Ryan!
Thanks for coming to the game.
And you were worried he wouldn't show up.
Not good.
No one listens to the squirrel.
I don't know what to do anymore, Benny.
- I've tried everything.
- Everything?
- You tried everything?
- What are you saying?
I'm saying you have to tell him the truth.
I don't think I could do that, Benny.
I mean...
What's he gonna think of me when he finds out?
I don't know.
But if you don't tell him you're gonna lose him, Sammy.
The green boxes.
OK, they're all loaded up!
- You don't think I know that?
- Get movin'!
I changed my mind!
I don't wanna go!
Help!
Ryan.
Help me!
Watch out!
Sam!
- Wait for us!
- Dad!
- Ryan!
- Dad!
Don't let them take me!
- No!
- Ryan!
Help!
- No!
- Dad!
Help me!
Ryan!
- Benny, we need that truck followed.
- Check.
Get me... the pigeons.
I am wanting snake eyes!
Come on, baby.
Come on, just throw it.
Thanks.
Hamir!
You are the great loser of all time!
What offerings must I make, I wonder?
Hamir!
Hamir!
Get a grip on yourself!
Benny!
I am needing till Friday before I am paying you back!
No, no.
It's Ryan.
He's in one of those green boxes and they took it away!
We've got to find him!
That is not good!
Not good at all!
I know!
I know!
I am telling him, you crazy pigeon!
The green boxes go to the big water where stiff lady with spikes on her head...
- Hamir?
I can't understand...
- Spikes!
Just tell me where the green boxes go.
Stiff lady, spikies?
Yes, like my wife says, the truck takes them to her!
To her!
Though I hate telling bad news, there is more bad news to tell.
When the sun rises, the green boxes leave on boat-boat and never return!
I am sorry for this.
I really am.
Hello?
No.
Not good.
Not good.
You always say that.
I keep on sayin' it.
No one's listenin'.
Like a broken record here.
OK.
When do we leave, Sammy?
Yeah, when do we leave?
It's not "we." It's me.
Let's make this clear.
This is now a rescue mission and I am the only one going.
We'll come too!
We're not afraid.
Are we, guys?
Afraid?
No.
You know koalas.
More like "scared of things."
Ryan's like a cub to all of us.
Not that I'll ever have one of my own at this rate.
You know, there's that famous...
A koala once said,
"We will fight them... with peaches."
Yeah.
Anyway.
- So we're helping, whatever it takes.
- You want to leave with me?
OK.
If you don't mind being hunted down, shot at...
-...stuffed...
- OK!
...or worse, then fine.
I have a recurring nightmare about taxidermy and spot remover.
Well, they have to catch us before they can stuff us and I'm fast.
Nobody's leaving but me.
Got it?
- You're the boss.
- You bet.
- You got the big hair.
- Absolutely.
Yeah, that's good, Sammy.
Hey, way to weed out the weak links.
Now that they're out of the picture, what's the plan?
Don't worry about a thing, big guy.
I got it all taken care of.
I know this city like the back of my paw.
We ditch this truck at Fifth Avenue, couple lefts, couple rights, bada-boom, past Broadway and...
You're there!
What are you doing here?
- What?
- We're going to help you find Ryan!
She said, "We're gonna help you find Ryan."
- Oh, great.
- Hey, guys.
I've got popcorn up my bum.
Do I look trashy in this?
OK, here's my...
Here's my overall plan.
Where are we going?
I only have until sunrise before Ryan is taken away forever!
And now I have to worry about you three?
All right, fine.
When do we get off of this thing, Benny?
Benny's here?
Yeah, he's right there.
Benny?
Benny!
Great.
Now what am I gonna do?
Guys!
Guys!
I think we should duck!
What is she saying?
She said, "Duck down!"
Duck!
I am not in the mood for a game of footsie or hoofsie or pawsie or...
That wasn't my paw.
It was this!
I didn't steal it.
I borrowed it.
It'll light the way to Ryan.
The walls are moving.
Right, right.
The walls...
The walls are moving!
Larry, hold your breath!
Larry, stay straight!
Everybody out!
All right, don't panic.
What we've got to do...
This is definitely not good.
Samson!
- Give me your hoof!
- Help!
Larry!
The garbage!
It lives!
Guys?
OK, anybody?
I'm freakin' out.
- What's the hold up?
- Hello?
We're over here, Nigel.
Right.
I'll be there in a minute.
Think.
What did Benny say?
Couple of lefts, couple of rights.
Bridget, can you see the green lady?
I'm looking, I'm looking, but I can't see over anything for a change.
How far are you away?
You in a different continent?
Is that you, Larry?
Up here, Nige.
You're a very furry snake.
Guys...
We don't want to draw attention to ourselves.
Dogs.
This should be fun for you, Samson.
Nigel!
Grab Bridget!
- What?
- Run!
I'm gonna throw up!
I'm gonna throw up!
Shouldn't you be tearing them to shreds?
All part of the plan.
This maneuver's known as the Serengeti Slip.
Page ten of the Predator's Playbook.
What next?
Page 11?
Go on, you mutts!
Stupid dogs, we could've taken you.
Taken you to a...
To a disco!
Larry, improvise!
- Larry, that's not helping.
- OK.
You dogs think you got bark?
Well, Samson's got roar!
- Show 'em, Sam.
- Dig deep, Samson.
You're a lion.
Be a lion.
Look at that guy!
Sam, they are frothing at the mouth.
OK...
- Larry, coil!
- Check!
- Sam!
- I improvised.
Now jump!
- Down there?
- Yes!
We're leaving, Larry!
Teensy question, Samson.
With those dogs up there, why didn't you just do what you did in the wild?
You know, lionize 'em or lionate them or lionify them?
I don't have time to fight dogs, Bridget.
We have to find Ryan, remember?
What is this stinky place?
It appears to be a human bathing area.
You mean humans don't lick themselves clean?
Disgusting!
They're hopeless.
It is hard to believe they are at the top of the food chain.
I can't imagine beginning the day without licking myself.
No hurry, but is there a plan?
Of course there's a plan.
We follow this water to the big water, and then we find the lady with...
Larry, either your stomach is growling or something in it is growling.
Wasn't me.
What?
- Smooth move, Nigel!
- Oh, boy!
Twins!
OK, Sammy, hurry it up now, 'cause these guys are seeming to have acid reflux or something!
Everybody... stay calm.
- Calm?
- Not good.
Yo.
Boo!
I'm gonna say, it looks like you and your crew here are a little far from your borough.
Far from your borough!
I love it.
We're going to the big water.
Nigel, show them what we're looking for.
- Like this?
- I think it's in her right hand.
- And isn't she blue?
- I can't do blue.
- No idea.
You?
- Doesn't even register.
- You're batting' zero, kid.
- Do the thing with...
Make your bloody mind up.
The big female with the spikes on her melon!
They're tourists.
All right, tourists, listen up.
Ya gotta get to Battery Park.
First take the Broadway culvert.
- Down the Broadway culvert?
- What's wrong with that?
- They get lost at the sewage plant!
- Get outta here!
- What are you talking about?
- How would you send 'em?
You're sendin' 'em the wrong way!
The Wall Street culvert is blocked with construction.
- That is true.
- All right.
Guys, you gonna help or not?
Yeah, sure.
Of course we're gonna help ya's.
We're one big family, right?
Except for that guy there.
He scares the...
You done runnin' your mouth yet, Carmine?
Are ya?
I apologize.
He never got over being flushed down the toilet.
Yeah.
Follow me, 'cause you four won't last ten minutes in this neighborhood.
It's a jungle down here.
- Stan, you know who that is?
- What?
No.
That's one of them talkin' kawana bears!
How ya doing?
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I've seen a lot of those things floating' here in the sewer.
That's good!
You're makin' me laugh over here.
Just wait for me!
Are we in the right place?
Any place without two hilarious alligators seems a move in the right direction.
- Sam, do you see anything up there?
- I sure do.
Well, well, well.
There she is, like Hamir said.
And it's sunrise, which means we're a tad short on time.
Guys, look.
We know the box Ryan's in is green.
It's gotta be around here, so I need you to...
Yeah.
So we should shout out if we see a box that looks like the ones over there.
It hasn't left yet!
We can make it!
- Let's go!
- Hold on, Larry!
- Which way now?
- Yeah, which way?
Run!
No!
No!
Ryan's on that thing!
We've got to stop it!
- We can't, Sam!
- I don't care!
- No, Sammy, you'll drown!
- Sam!
I failed.
Again.
I only count one failure.
It's big, but it's just one.
Goodbye, Ryan.
We're gonna miss ya.
- Samson!
- What on earth is going on?
It's a human and I do not think he works for the zoo.
Perhaps now is a good time to improvise.
What?
Great!
One problem down...
Far out.
Cool.
One disaster to go.
What are you doing?
We're headed for the other boat!
How do we steer?
Who knows how to steer?
None of us.
We're animals.
Great!
- Hold on, Larry.
Do that again.
- Do what?
Whatever you just did, but the opposite!
But I don't know my opposites!
No, Larry, like this!
I think I've got it.
Well, that was easy.
Oh, dear.
Has anyone got any eucalyptus wipes?
This isn't so difficult.
I'm the lion of the sea!
Well done, sir.
Captain of our team and now captain of this vessel.
You're brilliant.
I hate to be Miss Negative, but in this melee, we seem to have lost Ryan's boat.
- What, nothing?
- Nothing.
He's gone.
No.
There!
Nelson!
The green boxes!
- You're sure, eh?
- And there's my buddies!
And my love!
Let's go in!
- We'll head away from the sun.
- No, towards the sun.
To the north.
Starboard...
Leftboard.
Just follow my finger.
Please.
You guys wouldn't know the answer if it fell from the sky and hit you in the head.
Oh, my!
It's a bat!
It's a bat!
Get it off me!
Get it off me!
- Benny!
- Benny?
Geese!
- Are you all right?
- Yes, my princess.
Benny, you made it!
You're my best friend.
Best friends should stick together.
Even not-so-best friends, who knock you off a speeding garbage truck.
Excuse me, but I begged them to go back and get you.
Just so you know.
Benny, could you see Ryan's boat from up there?
Well, it just so happens I saw it heading that way.
And we're in luck!
- How's it goin', eh?
- Canadian geese!
Experts at intercontinental travel.
Hey, birdie, OK, is it true that Canada has lax immigration policies for koalas?
I'll take it from here.
My son's out there.
We really need your help.
Can you lead us to that boat?
No problem, eh?
Just follow us and Bob's your uncle.
Try not to lag too far behind, eh?
Hey, Benny, thanks.
And fyi, Bridget was very concerned when you fell off the truck.
Bet you didn't know I could ride geese, did you?
- Bareback.
- Oh, brother.
Sammy?
We going to the wild now?
I think we are, Larry.
I can't take it anymore.
He's taunting us!
Listen!
Stop laughing at us, you solar twit!
Captain Bligh, sir!
Are the ice cream cones ready?
The crew, they're on the verge of mutiny.
Nigel, please.
If you don't give us ice creams pretty quick, you're gonna walk the plank, sir!
- Nigel.
- I don't care if I drown,
I'm getting off this death cruise right now.
Iceberg!
Permission to go down with the ship, sir.
Hang on!
Stuff that!
Run!
Swim!
Nigel?
Look, I'm a starfish.
Guys, look.
Gosh.
Must feel like a lifetime since you've been here.
Yeah... a lifetime.
What the heck?
Wow!
Look!
They're releasing the green boxes back into the wild.
- Larry.
- Guys, they're putting animals inside the green boxes.
I just can't figure out why.
It's a tunnel to another dimension, can't you see?
- They go in...
- Who is this guy?
It's all right, Nigel.
Think it has anything to do with that?
Hang on a second.
Either I'm starving or Larry is making sense.
You're right.
Those animals are being rescued.
Ryan?
Ryan!
Oh, no!
Ryan!
We've got to move fast!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Where are you, buddy?
Ryan!
- I can't believe it!
- Samson!
I was so close.
He was right there!
- We'll never find him now!
- Come here!
Will you get a hold of yourself?
Use your instincts.
I don't want to run anymore.
Good. 'Cause frankly, you need a good sports bra.
- Ryan?
- Everything's under control.
- Temporary setback.
- I got it.
- I got Ryan's scent!
- He got it?
I mean, he got it!
Let's go!
- Hooray!
- Wait for us!
I'm not designed for this!
I want a car.
Hey, guys, I found him!
Ryan!
Doesn't anyone knock anymore?
Where's my son?
Did he come through here?
Yeah, now that I think about it, he did come through here.
Hello?
Come on out, baby lion!
Your dad's here!
Well, what do you know?
There's a whole pride of lions here!
Funky.
I was under the impression you had Ryan's scent, not this olfactory insult.
I...
I had Ryan's scent, but my predator instincts must've kicked in since, you know, I haven't eaten for a while.
Exactly!
You never know when those instincts are gonna kick in.
Excellent.
Fantastic!
We get to see the legend in action.
I'd love to, but we just don't have time.
We got the time, Sammy.
Just...
And then you do this.
And then this bit.
Rip him apart!
The horror.
I can't bear to watch!
But I have to.
Go on.
Get out of here.
- The legend dropped his dinner.
- Oh, boy.
What's wrong?
I'm not good enough for you to eat?
No.
It's just I'm allergic to nuts.
Now I get it.
You're gonna toy with me?
Beat me up a little, then pounce when I get my hopes up?
How exciting.
Come on, guys.
Ryan can't be far.
Hey!
I'm not finished with you!
I am a delicacy.
My flesh has fruity wood notes!
Watch it, you little hors d'oeuvre.
That's Samson the Wild.
You call this wild?
This is a cat!
A big, fat, tame pussycat!
- OK, that's enough!
- The pussycat hissed at me!
Maybe I should hide behind the koala for protection.
While we're at it, could you slap me in the face?
No.
What are you, a twit?
- Ignore him.
- Don't bother!
I'm leaving.
- You're weird.
- Run for your lives!
It's a lion with moral issues!
And I've had it with you too!
Thanks a lot for wrecking my day!
Teensy question.
Or more like a...
a sort of a query meets a statement.
That hyrax back there?
It was sort of like you couldn't eat him.
Yeah, and what about those dogs?
There was no munching there, either.
If I didn't know any better, I'd say that you're...
- A vegetarian?
- Nope.
- That's not what I was going to say.
- You were going to say...
- It's almost like...
- You're not from...
The wild?
Well, you're right.
I'm not from the wild.
What?
I'm just a phony.
Truth is I can't protect you out here.
Please just go back to the boat.
I've got to find my son.
Tell me we're not in a dangerous jungle with an 8-inch squirrel protecting us.
Actually, I'm nine inches, but other than that, yes.
So that means...
We are going to die!
Hey, guys!
Guys!
Will the three of you calm down?
How could he lie to us?
- We're his best friends.
- Sure.
Maybe he lied 'cause he didn't want to tell us the truth.
OK, yeah, whatever.
Whatever.
Let's just go back to the boat, then.
The fierce, the proud, the wild...
Rubbish!
But wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait!
Where you goin'?
Stop right there!
Stop!
Bridget, if you go, I'm...
I'm breaking up with you.
We were never going out in the first place.
Then we're taking a break.
- Nigel!
- All right!
Hey, listen!
I know you're scared.
But at least we got each other.
Sammy's got nobody.
He's out there all alone.
And... so is Ryan.
OK, OK, focus, Samson.
He's got to be out there somewhere.
You'll find him.
I mean, how big can this place be, anyway?
Ryan!
Hey there, little fella.
You're lost too, huh?
You remind me of my buddy back home.
A bloodthirsty monster!
Where?
Where?
He's a killer!
Get away from my baby!
Calm down, lady!
Won't anyone save my baby?
Bye-bye.
Ryan!
Ryan!
Sammy!
I wasn't meant for the wild.
I was made to nibble and be elegant and to appear in children's books as the letter G.
Come on, this isn't scary, is it?
It's just leaves and vines and...
Oh, that's my foot.
Nigel, keep a lookout back there.
- You too, Larry!
- Okeydokey.
Oh, I see.
All right, OK, yeah.
You're giving me the silent treatment.
Like I care.
Nigel!
I gave you an order.
Would a little "Sir, yes, sir!" kill ya?
Nigel.
That's not funny, Nigel.
- He's gone!
We're doomed.
- Nigel!
First Ryan, then Samson, and now Nigel!
I do believe in zoos.
- Larry, you're tensing up!
- I do, I do, I do.
- Don't panic.
I'm in charge.
- That's why we're panicking!
I say we fan out and circle.
What are we, peacocks?
We don't fan, we run.
Run for your lives, everybody!
Guys, I've got an idea.
Why don't we ask them?
It's OK...
They, you see, they got hooves.
That means they don't hunt.
They graze.
But they're licking their chops.
I'll take the one with the funny knees.
The funny knee...?
Benny, no!
Benny?
Get them.
Just, hey, back off.
I'm sorry,
I'm not that kind of koala bear.
Right.
Excuse me?
Hello?
Terribly sorry to bother you, but do you speak koala?
Sprechen Sie koala?
Right.
Could you possibly not go towards the big smoking thing?
G'day, mate G'day, mate
G'day, mate G'day, mate
G'day, mate G'day, mate
What a strange place for a party.
Very good, very organized.
Can I use your toilet?
I'm having a
Really nice day Really nice day
Really nice day
I'm having a
Really nice day Really nice day
Really nice day
- Why don't you all
- Tickle away, tickle away
They're frighteningly horrible monster beasts but they're not bad dancers.
I'm so cuddly I like you
I'm so cuddly I like you
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
- I'm having a
- Really nice day
Oh, no!
Tickle away Tickle away
I'm so cuddly, I like you Good day
- What is that?
- I am Kazar.
Leader.
Prophet.
Choreographer.
And with your help... carnivore!
No!
Don't kill me!
I've had such a weird life!
This is not fair.
Oh, I get it.
A yoga retreat.
Ryan!
You can do this.
Use your instincts.
Follow your instincts.
Use your instincts.
OK.
Down this way.
This way.
A lion cub.
We must tell Kazar.
- It's my turn to tell him.
- You got to last time.
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!
Thank you very much, but I'm afraid I've got to run.
Koalas are very busy bees.
If I could...
I'll just buzz along to the door...
For centuries, we've watched our brethren perish at the claw of the lion.
Today, we put our hooves down.
No longer will we dwell at the bottom of the food chain.
Well, yes.
I should say so.
There were those who doubted that you'd arrive to lead us.
But I always believed in the Omen.
The Omen!
Right.
Remind me again?
Sent down by the gods years ago...
Oh, no!
Not you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
Oh, Great Him, you must lead us in our transformation from prey to predator.
Hold it.
I am the Great Him?
- The Great Him?
- Him.
So this is all your fault!
That's it!
You...!
- Kazar!
- Kazar!
Don't listen to him!
- Kazar!
Over here!
- Kazar!
Over here!
How dare you interrupt my audience with the Great Him!
But... but we found a lion cub!
- You did?
- Was he with a big lion?
With big hair?
Well, a mullet, really.
Oh, Great Him, you brought two lions with you?
Well, like any Great Him,
I travel with an entourage.
Worry not, Your Himness, I shall have Blag bring the lions here.
And he better not screw this up, like you screwed up my dance number!
I lost count for one verse.
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
Why do we even bother rehearsing?
A good chorus line is so hard to put together.
Take to the skies!
We're taking!
We're taking!
- Find them!
- Yes, sir.
Bring us those lions!
The gods celebrate the fulfillment of the prophecy.
We stamp our hooves in praise of the Great Him!
Holy moly!
Holy moly Holy moly
You are our king!
Looky, looky who's there.
Surprise!
No!
Sorry we're late for dinner!
That's pathetic!
Get off!
- That didn't hurt!
- Stop!
- Ryan!
- No!
I'm coming, son!
Dad?
- Help!
- Let's scram!
- Ryan!
- What are you doing here?
- I can't believe it!
I found you.
- How'd you find me?
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
- Your paw.
- I got trapped in that box.
It's OK, son.
And then I escaped, and I ran into the jungle then those vultures came and tried to kill me.
You wouldn't have been scared.
I was.
- I have to tell you something.
- What?
Listen.
- Get 'em, Dad!
- Run!
Run!
Dad, you should be chasing them!
- Like you used to!
- Those were just stories!
But now's your chance to show me for real!
This way!
- Dad?
What's goin' on?
- Just get up into that tree!
- I think we lost them.
- What's the deal?
They're just a bunch of wimpy donkeys!
You could kick their rumps!
- Ryan, I can't fight them.
- You donkey-chickens!
Get back here!
Ryan!
I can't fight them.
What do you mean?
I was young still just a cub.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Children of all ages.
Samson!
Swallow that fear and stand tall!
Witness the greatest day in our young lion's life!
The day he discovers his roar!
Dad, I can't do it!
Now, go!
Listen as Samson unleashes a roar so mighty, it launches a wildebeest clear off the savannah!
Samson!
Dig deep!
I should have known.
If you'd been born in the wild, you'd know how to roar.
Dad?
Dad!
Dad!
Please!
Dad.
When they shipped me to the zoo, I never wanted anyone to know where I came from.
Especially those closest to me.
I should have told you sooner.
But... all those stories you tell?
I'm so sorry, Ryan.
Everything you told me was a lie?
- Dad!
- Hang on, son.
Help!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Run!
Not so fast, Tigger.
Dad!
Ryan!
Dad!
- Help!
- Ryan.
Help!
Dad!
- Ryan.
- Dad!
Help me!
What?
Wait!
What?
What?
Wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Get off me!
What is goin' on here?
- Stinky does not speak.
- It rolls like a little ball.
Wait.
You guys think I'm a...?
- Achtung, Stinky!
- Less talk, more roll.
- Ja.
- Roll!
Roll!
What the...?
Hey!
Rolling the dung is good for tight buns!
I'll give you something to roll about!
It's a good thing Bridget didn't see that!
Bridget?
Larry!
They're gone.
I gotta find them!
No!
I gotta find Samson first!
No!
First...
Sam.
Sam!
Bridget!
Larry!
Oh, Ryan!
You're alive!
Good to see you guys.
- Where's my hug?
- Larry.
- There it is.
- It's good to see you too.
What are you guys doing here?
We came here with your father to find you.
And he's probably out there right now lookin' for us.
I wish he were.
But some of these wildebeests pushed him off a cliff.
- What?
- What?
I don't think he made it.
I don't see how he could.
Oh, Ryan.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Kazar, I think you'll be very pleased with what I brought you.
What's this?
Where's the other lion?
Right.
Well, I was gonna tell you, there was this cliff and...
Why are you looking at me like that?
That's twice you've been out of step today, Blag!
You klutz.
You know we can't ascend to the top of the food chain until we eat a lion!
Well, at least there'll be enough for my ascension.
What about the rest of us?
Step-kick, pivot-kick!
Ouch!
I twisted a hoof!
You work and you work.
Then they break your heart.
- There goes my career!
- Prepare the sacrifices!
Why did I let him go off by himself?
He couldn't catch a cold, much less his own lunch.
Bet I could catch you.
Please.
My natural predator is fuel inject...
What?
I knew you weren't really gone.
I knew it!
Come on, I knew it!
We're still buddies, right?
I lost Ryan.
There were too many.
They just took him.
Who?
Who took him?
- Wildebeests.
- The freaks with the hooves!
They got Larry and Bridget too.
Couldn't fight, couldn't...
Come on, Sam.
You're a lion.
You come from a long line of kings.
Yeah, maybe you're not from the wild.
But fighting's in your blood!
No.
I'll never be a real lion.
Wrong!
You are a real lion.
Doesn't matter where you're from:
Zoo, jungle, goldfish bowl.
It's what's in here.
That determines who you are!
At least, that's what you always told your son.
Now he's out there, Sammy, and he needs you.
Who else is gonna teach him how to roar?
That's it, Sammy.
That's it.
Let's go find my son...
and my friends.
Yeah!
Nothing's gonna stop us!
Except that we have no idea where we're going!
Follow your instincts.
Follow your instincts.
- What is that?
- My... instincts?
- Benny?
- You're almost there.
That settles it, then.
My mother definitely drank pool water when she was pregnant with me.
Benny, look.
The freaks with hooves!
Ryan's in there.
You can't just barge in.
That's suicide!
- Benny, get out of my way!
- Don't listen to the rat.
- Hey, who are you calling a rat?
- You, of course.
- You'll give away our position.
- I'll have you written up for that!
Fool!
You blew our cover!
Men!
Scatter!
Not so fast!
Look who I got, Sammy.
It's your lion instincts.
Who are you guys?
- Our names aren't important.
- I'm Cloak.
He's Camo.
- We're covert agents.
- Why have you been leading me around?
- That's classified.
- Top-secret.
- The wildebeests have gone mad.
- Cloak.
It's not like I told them our plan is to use them to defeat Kazar's...
Listen, just tell me, did they take my son in there?
- That's need-to-know.
- They did.
- They think the koala's a god.
- You're the worst covert agent!
Oh, yeah?
Then why can I do this?
Men!
Hey!
No!
Stop!
Sammy!
- Idiot!
That maneuver's confidential.
- It's secret.
This one's confidential.
- Cloak!
- And this one's restricted.
Super-secret.
Top-secret.
This is ultra-secret!
Enough!
No more!
Show 'em the super-top-secret "no more?" Gotcha!
No!
I got an idea.
Who is this Great Him, anyway?
I'll take him on.
I'm the Great Her!
I'll show Him a thing or two.
I'm from New York City, for Pete's sake.
Oh, my.
You have got to be kidding me.
Nigel, I don't know what you're trying to pull,
- but I will kick your...
- Silence!
Why, you little...
Silence, again!
You do not speak to me!
Nigel, what's the deal?
Great Him, shall we prepare the feast?
Yes, we shall!
What's on the menu?
Them.
Oh, no.
Eat friends and be god, don't eat friends...
God, friends, god, friends.
God, I...
Well, that was subtle.
Prepare the meat fire!
Wait!
We cannot cook them without onion!
Onions.
Onions.
Onions.
Well, that was fast.
Let the ritual begin.
Move it!
I am so mad at you!
Wait!
We also need... hats!
Do we not have the party hats of death?
I've got mine!
And before the feast, we must all...
What the...?
...levitate and spin uncontrollably!
And feel a bit sick.
How do I stop this thing?
- Guys.
- Benny?
- Look, a squirrel!
- Larry!
We've got a plan.
Follow me.
- We?
- I can fly!
Oh, Great Him, we are humbled by your power.
Be humbled.
Only the Great Him can do this!
- Volcanic gas!
- Our cover's blown!
Major malfunction!
Abandon ship!
- Oh, boy.
- Well, about time you got here.
Great Him, it's another miracle!
You've delivered us a real lion!
Blag, your luck has turned.
Thanks to the Great Him, we shall all ascend tonight.
Nigel, we've got to create a distraction.
Hang on a sec!
I've got miracles comin' out my ears!
Ready?
Stand back as the Great Me attacks the lion over 73 times my size!
Dad?
My dad's alive!
Guys, my dad made it!
- Ryan, no!
- Hurry, I got to see him!
Whack, whack, whack!
- Dad!
- What?
Ryan!
- I planned this.
- Ryan, no!
At long last, the cosmic balance has shifted.
- Stay close.
- Prey has become predator!
And predator has become prey!
And the hoof finally trumps the claw!
Come on, Dad!
Let's show these turkey-jerkies who's at the top of the food chain!
Let's eat the brat first.
Over my dead body!
Yeah.
Dad!
He's gonna kill Samson if we don't do something!
Why don't we use the secret play?
I know.
Shut up, Larry.
That's stupid.
No!
It's brilliant!
They laughed at me when I spoke of the Omen.
But look who's laughing now!
Little to the left.
Yeah.
No!
Little to the right!
Next floor: bottom of the food chain!
Ding!
Fire!
We gotta find something bigger!
I know where we can find something bigger.
- Ready, Ryan?
- Dig deep!
You should have stayed at home.
Now our shrine will become your tomb.
Fire!
Ryan!
Ryan!
I don't typically eat dessert before the main course!
Get away from my son!
Ryan.
Ryan, are you still with me?
It's OK, Dad.
I just want you to know
I'm sorry you didn't have a father like the one I have.
Ryan.
How touching.
But then, last words usually are.
Finish them.
What are you doing?
I command you to attack them, like true predators!
We're tired of pretending to be something we're not.
But most of all, we're tired of you.
Blag.
Fine.
I'll kill them myself!
Dad, remember what you always told me in your stories:
Dig deep.
Oh, yeah, baby!
Let's go.
Yeah.
- Come on, let's get out of here!
- Get out of here!
And for the record, I've always hated your choreography.
It's so... '80s.
That's right!
Run!
Run like the cowardly prey that you are!
I will hunt you down!
Everyone!
To the boat!
Top of the food chain, Ma!
Top of the food chain...
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
Hurry!
We're never gonna make it!
Push, you crazy, hairy monsters!
Push!
- Larry, throw it in reverse!
- Reverse throwing!
At least I saw the wild before it disappeared.
I can still see it.
It's right...
Here.
I found my roar.
We both did, son.
You know, Dad, this'll be our first story of Samson and Ryan the Wild.
I don't think anybody's gonna believe it.
Incoming!
I'm so cuddly!
Cuddly!
I'm so cuddly!
I know you're cuddly.
But can you float?
- I'm having a
- Really nice day
Really nice day Really nice day
Step-kick left!
Really nice day
Step-kick right!
- Splendid.
- No!
Smashing.
Hey!
- Stupendous!
- Are you guys sure about this?
Operation Snake-Over is now complete.
Hey, look, everyone!
I'm a secret agent!
Bridget, I get it.
You're more than a tall, lanky goddess.
You're a strong, independent female.
You don't need to be defined by your relationship
- and I, I respect that.
- It's about time.
What was that?
Just your daily dose of vitamin Bridget, baby.
Oh, yeah yeah!
Really nice day Really nice day
Look out!
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
Yes!
Did y'all see that?
Check this!
Go, Blag!
Go, Blag!
Go, Blag!
Hey, Blag.
- No parking' on the dance floor.
- Parkin'?
Dad?
Make some room there, big guy!
Really nice day Really, really nice day
Yeah!
Pretty crazy, right?
Pretty wild!
Well, technically, it...
It's awesome.
Yes, right.
- I was just gonna say that.
- Come on!
Everyone!
This is gonna be a long ride home.
I'm havin' a
Really nice day Really nice day, really nice day
- I'm having a
- I'm so cuddly, I like you
G'day
What are you doing this for?
What, do you think it's funny?
Just get out.
Sorry about that, everybody.
Sorry.
Hello.
Do carry on.
Come on!
All right, everybody exit in an orderly...
All right, single file!
Keep it...
I seem to do a lot of falling and screaming in this adventure.
So there I was, face to face with the biggest, meanest leopard on this side of the Serengeti.
And...
You roared so loud, his spots flew clean off.
Dad, I've heard this like a billion times.
Do you know the one where I made the laughing hyenas...
Cry?
Yep.
- The croc attack?
- Dad.
OK.
Think.
Yeah, you do that.
All right, Mr. Smart Guy, here's one I know you haven't heard.
It all started in the little place I like to call the wild.
They were the fastest wildebeests on the savannah.
We're talking fast.
All the other lions had given up the hunt hours ago, except your old man.
Fortunately, I knew a short cut.
I thought I had 'em.
Until the dust cleared.
Classic wildebeest trap.
So, what did you do next?
- What did I do?
- Yeah.
That's when I gave them the roar.
- That's it?
- Hold on a sec.
I only thought it was over.
But they had a secret weapon.
He was the biggest wildebeest I've ever seen.
- He was 14 feet tall!
- Fourteen?
I meant 1,401 feet tall!
Cool.
And he had two...
No, four of the biggest horns I'd ever seen.
- Whoa!
- His breath was red hot!
I mean, green.
And he hated the environment.
To pull this off, I knew I was gonna have to dig deep, deeper than I ever had before.
So I swallowed my fear, sucked in the biggest breath I could.
Dad, I'm ready!
- You got it?
- I got it!
- I got it!
- Well, let him have it!
Roar, son!
Story of my life.
Your roar stops a herd of wildebeests.
Mine makes the babies laugh.
Hey, come on.
That was much better.
I'm serious!
It dropped half an octave.
It dropped half an octave.
And it sure scared me.
- Made my hair stand up on end.
- Yeah, right, Dad.
- OK.
Let's take it from the top.
- I'm done for today.
Come on, come on, one more.
You were so close.
Maybe it's something technical.
Maybe you're not opening your mouth wide enough.
Like this.
Dad, thanks for the technical help, but if you wanted me to roar like you, you'd take me to the wild.
Hold on a second.
We've got everything we could ever want here.
Great lifestyle, three squares a day.
- It's boring.
- Boring?
- I'll never learn how to roar here.
- Ryan.
But don't worry.
I finally figured out
- how we can get to the wild.
- You did?
The pigeons say those green boxes go there.
Those boxes are bad news.
Stay away.
- But, Dad...
- I know you're frustrated,
- but a lion finds his roar...
- Here.
I'm so tired of hearing that, Dad!
It's a rat!
Get that rat off my baby!
A rat?
Hello!
Silly, silly rat.
- Rats do not got bling like this, lady.
- You little!
Lastly, that is the ugliest baby I've ever seen!
Benny, stealing candy from a baby?
Stealing is such a strong word.
I prefer "liberating."
Hey, kid, heard the roar.
Down another...
- Octave.
- Octave!
You ready to cheer me and your old man as we capture our fifth straight turtle-curling title?
I can't even roar.
How would you even know I'm there?
So, you really think it dropped an octave?
Absolutely.
- What the heck is an octave?
- I heard that.
- Rabbit.
- Cholesterol.
I'll stick with the nuts.
I don't know what his problem is, Benny.
He's 11, but he's still roaring at a nine-year-old level.
Little help here, Sammy?
You know what?
Maybe you're setting the bar too high, with all those stories about Samson the Wild.
Hey, he's always loved those stories!
They inspire him.
OK.
I'm not gonna argue with someone who can use my tail as dental floss.
- You got something right there.
- Where?
- No, no, other side.
- Here?
- Sorry, Benny.
- You got it.
Attention, friends.
Stop by the gift shop and get the most popular plush in America:
Nigel, the "I-Like-You" Koala.
- Look, honey!
The crazy thing talks!
- I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
That's right.
He's so cuddly.
And better yet, he likes you.
Finally.
And the zoo will officially be ours in T-minus three two and showtime!
Here I come!
Who put that bar there?
That tickles!
- Did too!
- Did not!
- Did too!
- Did not!
Out of my way, ya bum!
There's that moth-eaten koala!
I've told you flamingos a hundred times, walk.
- How about an autograph?
!
- Don't...
Birds!
Find the string on his back!
- So you're havin' a really nice day!
- Guys.
Off my co-captain, now.
Sorry, Samson.
That didn't hurt.
I almost forgot to tell you.
I'm gonna ask Bridget out finally.
Slow down, Romeo.
You are a squirrel and she is...
Perfect, right?
Look, I know what you're sayin'.
Believe me, I got my eyes wide open.
Watch where you're goin', you big!
Bridget.
Don't stare at my spots, Benny.
My eyes are up here.
Of course.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, this is for you, honey.
It goes around your left hoof.
Did you get that out of the trash?
You did!
You trash-picker!
I'm not a trash-picker.
I'm a recycler.
That's a lot more romantic.
Isn't it?
- Romantic?
- Sam, come here.
Romantic?
Don't mention romance to me, Benny.
- I've never had a boyfriend.
- That settles it.
I accept the job...
of boyfriend number one.
Benny, only the female orb-weaver spider will date a male one-twentieth her size.
- So there's hope!
- And then she eats him.
But at least he dies happy.
Let's get Ryan, dude!
Dude!
We said that at the same time!
Dude.
Hey!
Hey, Ryan.
Listen, I'm headin' down to the game.
I'm gonna see you there, right?
Come on, Ryan.
We need you.
You're our biggest fan.
Yo, Samson!
I'm your number one fan, man!
Thanks, man.
Right back at ya!
You were saying, Dad?
Listen.
About this afternoon, I was just trying...
Dad, fine.
I'll go to your game, all right?
OK.
I'll... see you there, then.
Come on, dude.
- Dude.
- Guess who's here?
Eze.
Duke.
Man, he always guesses.
We're gonna stalk the gazelles while everybody's at the game.
- You in?
- Let's go, bro!
The Ryanator.
I'm comin' down.
Fish heads!
Get your ice-cold fish heads!
Now eyeball-free!
We're into the final period of the curling championships and the penguins are up.
Here comes Victor.
What a beauty!
Yeah, sweep!
Heading straight for the bull's-eye!
This could be it, folks!
- Bo-wango!
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah!
- That's gonna be tough to beat.
What? "Tough to beat"?
That's just the way we like it, right, guys?
I can't believe this!
If we lose, I'm gonna rip my head off!
And yours!
We cannot lose to flightless birds!
Whoa, whoa.
No one is losing anything around here.
As long as we stay focused.
- By the way, has anyone seen Ryan?
- Oh!
I know!
Maybe he's sulking 'cause he lives in his father's shadow and he roars like a schoolgirl.
- Thanks, Lar.
- You betcha!
Nigel!
Nigel!
Will you sign my dolly?
- Not again.
- Nigel, ignore them.
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
- You're so cuddly!
We love you!
- That's it!
I am not cuddly!
I'm a vicious jungle animal from the streets of London!
- Fear me!
- Get him!
Get him!
Get him!
- Help me!
- Girls!
Put him down.
I am not a doll!
- Cushy tushy!
- Leave my bum alone!
Nigel!
Get your paws off my girlfriend!
Benny, I am not your girlfriend!
Really nice day!
What is up with Samson's team tonight?
Brutal!
Benny?
Oh, my gosh!
Who knows mouth-to-mouth?
I do!
What was that?
Just your daily dose of vitamin Benny, baby.
- Get off my nose.
- I'm so cuddly, I like you!
- Stop saying that!
- G'day, mate!
Cannonball!
Next year, I should just coach.
Check it.
The Thomson gazelle.
Zero to 50 in four-point-five seconds.
- The ultimate fleeing machine.
- There is no substitute.
Let's get a closer look at these slim jims.
- Shall we?
- I think we shall.
Maybe we should just go to the game.
- I thought you wanted to be wild.
- Your dad chased gazelles.
Yeah, if he were our age, he would so be rockin' out with us.
He'd be in there, runnin' 'em down like they were...
- Gazelles.
- Yeah, gazelles or somethin'.
Ready, man?
We'd better not.
Oh, yeah?
Are you gonna stop us?
- Guys, guys.
- Here we go!
The whole series comes down to this throw!
There's no tomorrow!
It's do or die!
Ya know what I mean.
Guys, I know we're down, but we're gonna pull this out 'cause we're gonna use the secret play.
- The secret play!
Hey, everybody, guess what?
We're gonna use the secret play!
Larry, the first part of the secret play is keeping it secret.
- OK.
- Follow my lead.
I'm going to need a double effort from everybody.
Absolutely, captain.
Triple effort if you want, sir.
- Good.
Ready, and...
- Break!
Quiet.
On three, dude.
One, two...
No!
Now you did it, Ryan.
Feelin' mean, Donald?
Bring it on!
Folks, there's pressure on the big guy!
- Ready, Bridget?
- Ready.
- Ready, Benny?
- Ready!
Samson, it's a shame your little brat isn't here to see you lose.
I can't... hold it!
Oh, no!
What are you doin'?
And here comes Samson.
Look at that guy.
Is he a beauty or what?
Larry!
Bridget!
Sweep!
What a recovery!
He's sendin' in Bridget and Larry to do the job!
Sweep faster, Larry!
Sweep, sweep!
- I am!
- Come on, man!
Team Penguin is sending their ace, Victor...
- Watch it, Victor!
- Watch it yourself, see?
Nigel, how are we looking?
- This could be trouble, folks!
- Sweep, sweep, sweep.
This is cheating and you will die for this.
I can't hear you, Nigel.
Move left a bit...
OK.
Move left and hit!
- Larry, no!
- Tallyho!
What a move!
Folks, we are inches away from the greatest upset in turtle-curling history!
- Oh, no!
I can't believe my eyes!
- No!
Looks like Samson might have choked!
- Nice!
- Yes!
Unbelievable!
Samson and his team have clinched the title!
- No, wait!
I've called it too soon!
- What the heck?
The penguins have done it!
They're zoo champs for the first time!
Stampede?
Stampede!
Please!
Stop!
Watch out!
Dude.
Busted.
Catastrophic.
Told you I'd come to the game.
You think this is funny?
You just endangered everyone in the zoo!
- I'm sorry.
- For what?
Chasing the gazelles or costing us the game?
All you do is sit up in your tree and sulk.
- If you just...
- What's the problem?
Is all this because you can't roar?
Ryan, I didn't mean that.
Know what I'm doing when I'm sulking in my tree?
I'm thinking how great it would be if Samson the Wild wasn't my father.
Ryan, I didn't...
'Cause it would make being Ryan the Lame a lot easier.
Ryan, I'm sorry.
Ryan!
Please don't leave.
Bye, Ryan!
Thanks for coming to the game.
And you were worried he wouldn't show up.
Not good.
No one listens to the squirrel.
I don't know what to do anymore, Benny.
- I've tried everything.
- Everything?
- You tried everything?
- What are you saying?
I'm saying you have to tell him the truth.
I don't think I could do that, Benny.
I mean...
What's he gonna think of me when he finds out?
I don't know.
But if you don't tell him you're gonna lose him, Sammy.
The green boxes.
OK, they're all loaded up!
- You don't think I know that?
- Get movin'!
I changed my mind!
I don't wanna go!
Help!
Ryan.
Help me!
Watch out!
Sam!
- Wait for us!
- Dad!
- Ryan!
- Dad!
Don't let them take me!
- No!
- Ryan!
Help!
- No!
- Dad!
Help me!
Ryan!
- Benny, we need that truck followed.
- Check.
Get me... the pigeons.
I am wanting snake eyes!
Come on, baby.
Come on, just throw it.
Thanks.
Hamir!
You are the great loser of all time!
What offerings must I make, I wonder?
Hamir!
Hamir!
Get a grip on yourself!
Benny!
I am needing till Friday before I am paying you back!
No, no.
It's Ryan.
He's in one of those green boxes and they took it away!
We've got to find him!
That is not good!
Not good at all!
I know!
I know!
I am telling him, you crazy pigeon!
The green boxes go to the big water where stiff lady with spikes on her head...
- Hamir?
I can't understand...
- Spikes!
Just tell me where the green boxes go.
Stiff lady, spikies?
Yes, like my wife says, the truck takes them to her!
To her!
Though I hate telling bad news, there is more bad news to tell.
When the sun rises, the green boxes leave on boat-boat and never return!
I am sorry for this.
I really am.
Hello?
No.
Not good.
Not good.
You always say that.
I keep on sayin' it.
No one's listenin'.
Like a broken record here.
OK.
When do we leave, Sammy?
Yeah, when do we leave?
It's not "we." It's me.
Let's make this clear.
This is now a rescue mission and I am the only one going.
We'll come too!
We're not afraid.
Are we, guys?
Afraid?
No.
You know koalas.
More like "scared of things."
Ryan's like a cub to all of us.
Not that I'll ever have one of my own at this rate.
You know, there's that famous...
A koala once said,
"We will fight them... with peaches."
Yeah.
Anyway.
- So we're helping, whatever it takes.
- You want to leave with me?
OK.
If you don't mind being hunted down, shot at stuffed...
- OK!
...or worse, then fine.
I have a recurring nightmare about taxidermy and spot remover.
Well, they have to catch us before they can stuff us and I'm fast.
Nobody's leaving but me.
Got it?
- You're the boss.
- You bet.
- You got the big hair.
- Absolutely.
Yeah, that's good, Sammy.
Hey, way to weed out the weak links.
Now that they're out of the picture, what's the plan?
Don't worry about a thing, big guy.
I got it all taken care of.
I know this city like the back of my paw.
We ditch this truck at Fifth Avenue, couple lefts, couple rights, bada-boom, past Broadway and...
You're there!
What are you doing here?
- What?
- We're going to help you find Ryan!
She said, "We're gonna help you find Ryan."
- Oh, great.
- Hey, guys.
I've got popcorn up my bum.
Do I look trashy in this?
OK, here's my...
Here's my overall plan.
Where are we going?
I only have until sunrise before Ryan is taken away forever!
And now I have to worry about you three?
All right, fine.
When do we get off of this thing, Benny?
Benny's here?
Yeah, he's right there.
Benny?
Benny!
Great.
Now what am I gonna do?
Guys!
Guys!
I think we should duck!
What is she saying?
She said, "Duck down!"
Duck!
I am not in the mood for a game of footsie or hoofsie or pawsie or...
That wasn't my paw.
It was this!
I didn't steal it.
I borrowed it.
It'll light the way to Ryan.
The walls are moving.
Right, right.
The walls...
The walls are moving!
Larry, hold your breath!
Larry, stay straight!
Everybody out!
All right, don't panic.
What we've got to do...
This is definitely not good.
Samson!
- Give me your hoof!
- Help!
Larry!
The garbage!
It lives!
Guys?
OK, anybody?
I'm freakin' out.
- What's the hold up?
- Hello?
We're over here, Nigel.
Right.
I'll be there in a minute.
Think.
What did Benny say?
Couple of lefts, couple of rights.
Bridget, can you see the green lady?
I'm looking, I'm looking, but I can't see over anything for a change.
How far are you away?
You in a different continent?
Is that you, Larry?
Up here, Nige.
You're a very furry snake.
Guys...
We don't want to draw attention to ourselves.
Dogs.
This should be fun for you, Samson.
Nigel!
Grab Bridget!
- What?
- Run!
I'm gonna throw up!
I'm gonna throw up!
Shouldn't you be tearing them to shreds?
All part of the plan.
This maneuver's known as the Serengeti Slip.
Page ten of the Predator's Playbook.
What next?
Page 11?
Go on, you mutts!
Stupid dogs, we could've taken you.
Taken you to a...
To a disco!
Larry, improvise!
- Larry, that's not helping.
- OK.
You dogs think you got bark?
Well, Samson's got roar!
- Show 'em, Sam.
- Dig deep, Samson.
You're a lion.
Be a lion.
Look at that guy!
Sam, they are frothing at the mouth.
OK...
- Larry, coil!
- Check!
- Sam!
- I improvised.
Now jump!
- Down there?
- Yes!
We're leaving, Larry!
Teensy question, Samson.
With those dogs up there, why didn't you just do what you did in the wild?
You know, lionize 'em or lionate them or lionify them?
I don't have time to fight dogs, Bridget.
We have to find Ryan, remember?
What is this stinky place?
It appears to be a human bathing area.
You mean humans don't lick themselves clean?
Disgusting!
They're hopeless.
It is hard to believe they are at the top of the food chain.
I can't imagine beginning the day without licking myself.
No hurry, but is there a plan?
Of course there's a plan.
We follow this water to the big water, and then we find the lady with...
Larry, either your stomach is growling or something in it is growling.
Wasn't me.
What?
- Smooth move, Nigel!
- Oh, boy!
Twins!
OK, Sammy, hurry it up now, 'cause these guys are seeming to have acid reflux or something!
Everybody... stay calm.
- Calm?
- Not good.
Yo.
Boo!
I'm gonna say, it looks like you and your crew here are a little far from your borough.
Far from your borough!
I love it.
We're going to the big water.
Nigel, show them what we're looking for.
- Like this?
- I think it's in her right hand.
- And isn't she blue?
- I can't do blue.
- No idea.
You?
- Doesn't even register.
- You're batting' zero, kid.
- Do the thing with...
Make your bloody mind up.
The big female with the spikes on her melon!
They're tourists.
All right, tourists, listen up.
Ya gotta get to Battery Park.
First take the Broadway culvert.
- Down the Broadway culvert?
- What's wrong with that?
- They get lost at the sewage plant!
- Get outta here!
- What are you talking about?
- How would you send 'em?
You're sendin' 'em the wrong way!
The Wall Street culvert is blocked with construction.
- That is true.
- All right.
Guys, you gonna help or not?
Yeah, sure.
Of course we're gonna help ya's.
We're one big family, right?
Except for that guy there.
He scares the...
You done runnin' your mouth yet, Carmine?
Are ya?
I apologize.
He never got over being flushed down the toilet.
Yeah.
Follow me, 'cause you four won't last ten minutes in this neighborhood.
It's a jungle down here.
- Stan, you know who that is?
- What?
No.
That's one of them talkin' kawana bears!
How ya doing?
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I've seen a lot of those things floating' here in the sewer.
That's good!
You're makin' me laugh over here.
Just wait for me!
Are we in the right place?
Any place without two hilarious alligators seems a move in the right direction.
- Sam, do you see anything up there?
- I sure do.
Well, well, well.
There she is, like Hamir said.
And it's sunrise, which means we're a tad short on time.
Guys, look.
We know the box Ryan's in is green.
It's gotta be around here, so I need you to...
Yeah.
So we should shout out if we see a box that looks like the ones over there.
It hasn't left yet!
We can make it!
- Let's go!
- Hold on, Larry!
- Which way now?
- Yeah, which way?
Run!
No!
No!
Ryan's on that thing!
We've got to stop it!
- We can't, Sam!
- I don't care!
- No, Sammy, you'll drown!
- Sam!
I failed.
Again.
I only count one failure.
It's big, but it's just one.
Goodbye, Ryan.
We're gonna miss ya.
- Samson!
- What on earth is going on?
It's a human and I do not think he works for the zoo.
Perhaps now is a good time to improvise.
What?
Great!
One problem down...
Far out.
Cool.
One disaster to go.
What are you doing?
We're headed for the other boat!
How do we steer?
Who knows how to steer?
None of us.
We're animals.
Great!
- Hold on, Larry.
Do that again.
- Do what?
Whatever you just did, but the opposite!
But I don't know my opposites!
No, Larry, like this!
I think I've got it.
Well, that was easy.
Oh, dear.
Has anyone got any eucalyptus wipes?
This isn't so difficult.
I'm the lion of the sea!
Well done, sir.
Captain of our team and now captain of this vessel.
You're brilliant.
I hate to be Miss Negative, but in this melee, we seem to have lost Ryan's boat.
- What, nothing?
- Nothing.
He's gone.
No.
There!
Nelson!
The green boxes!
- You're sure, eh?
- And there's my buddies!
And my love!
Let's go in!
- We'll head away from the sun.
- No, towards the sun.
To the north.
Starboard...
Leftboard.
Just follow my finger.
Please.
You guys wouldn't know the answer if it fell from the sky and hit you in the head.
Oh, my!
It's a bat!
It's a bat!
Get it off me!
Get it off me!
- Benny!
- Benny?
Geese!
- Are you all right?
- Yes, my princess.
Benny, you made it!
You're my best friend.
Best friends should stick together.
Even not-so-best friends, who knock you off a speeding garbage truck.
Excuse me, but I begged them to go back and get you.
Just so you know.
Benny, could you see Ryan's boat from up there?
Well, it just so happens I saw it heading that way.
And we're in luck!
- How's it goin', eh?
- Canadian geese!
Experts at intercontinental travel.
Hey, birdie, OK, is it true that Canada has lax immigration policies for koalas?
I'll take it from here.
My son's out there.
We really need your help.
Can you lead us to that boat?
No problem, eh?
Just follow us and Bob's your uncle.
Try not to lag too far behind, eh?
Hey, Benny, thanks.
And FYI, Bridget was very concerned when you fell off the truck.
Bet you didn't know I could ride geese, did you?
- Bareback.
- Oh, brother.
Sammy?
We going to the wild now?
I think we are, Larry.
I can't take it anymore.
He's taunting us!
Listen!
Stop laughing at us, you solar twit!
Captain Bligh, sir!
Are the ice cream cones ready?
The crew, they're on the verge of mutiny.
Nigel, please.
If you don't give us ice creams pretty quick, you're gonna walk the plank, sir!
- Nigel.
- I don't care if I drown,
I'm getting off this death cruise right now.
Iceberg!
Permission to go down with the ship, sir.
Hang on!
Stuff that!
Run!
Swim!
Nigel?
Look, I'm a starfish.
Guys, look.
Gosh.
Must feel like a lifetime since you've been here.
Yeah... a lifetime.
What the heck?
Wow!
Look!
They're releasing the green boxes back into the wild.
- Larry.
- Guys, they're putting animals inside the green boxes.
I just can't figure out why.
It's a tunnel to another dimension, can't you see?
- They go in...
- Who is this guy?
It's all right, Nigel.
Think it has anything to do with that?
Hang on a second.
Either I'm starving or Larry is making sense.
You're right.
Those animals are being rescued.
Ryan?
Ryan!
Oh, no!
Ryan!
We've got to move fast!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Where are you, buddy?
Ryan!
- I can't believe it!
- Samson!
I was so close.
He was right there!
- We'll never find him now!
- Come here!
Will you get a hold of yourself?
Use your instincts.
I don't want to run anymore.
Good. 'Cause frankly, you need a good sports bra.
- Ryan?
- Everything's under control.
- Temporary setback.
- I got it.
- I got Ryan's scent!
- He got it?
I mean, he got it!
Let's go!
- Hooray!
- Wait for us!
I'm not designed for this!
I want a car.
Hey, guys, I found him!
Ryan!
Doesn't anyone knock anymore?
Where's my son?
Did he come through here?
Yeah, now that I think about it, he did come through here.
Hello?
Come on out, baby lion!
Your dad's here!
Well, what do you know?
There's a whole pride of lions here!
Funky.
I was under the impression you had Ryan's scent, not this olfactory insult.
I...
I had Ryan's scent, but my predator instincts must've kicked in since, you know, I haven't eaten for a while.
Exactly!
You never know when those instincts are gonna kick in.
Excellent.
Fantastic!
We get to see the legend in action.
I'd love to, but we just don't have time.
We got the time, Sammy.
Just...
And then you do this.
And then this bit.
Rip him apart!
The horror.
I can't bear to watch!
But I have to.
Go on.
Get out of here.
- The legend dropped his dinner.
- Oh, boy.
What's wrong?
I'm not good enough for you to eat?
No.
It's just I'm allergic to nuts.
Now I get it.
You're gonna toy with me?
Beat me up a little, then pounce when I get my hopes up?
How exciting.
Come on, guys.
Ryan can't be far.
Hey!
I'm not finished with you!
I am a delicacy.
My flesh has fruity wood notes!
Watch it, you little hors d'oeuvre.
That's Samson the Wild.
You call this wild?
This is a cat!
A big, fat, tame pussycat!
- OK, that's enough!
- The pussycat hissed at me!
Maybe I should hide behind the koala for protection.
While we're at it, could you slap me in the face?
No.
What are you, a twit?
- Ignore him.
- Don't bother!
I'm leaving.
- You're weird.
- Run for your lives!
It's a lion with moral issues!
And I've had it with you too!
Thanks a lot for wrecking my day!
Teensy question.
Or more like a...
a sort of a query meets a statement.
That hyrax back there?
It was sort of like you couldn't eat him.
Yeah, and what about those dogs?
There was no munching there, either.
If I didn't know any better, I'd say that you're...
- A vegetarian?
- Nope.
- That's not what I was going to say.
- You were going to say...
- It's almost like...
- You're not from...
The wild?
Well, you're right.
I'm not from the wild.
What?
I'm just a phony.
Truth is I can't protect you out here.
Please just go back to the boat.
I've got to find my son.
Tell me we're not in a dangerous jungle with an 8-inch squirrel protecting us.
Actually, I'm nine inches, but other than that, yes.
So that means...
We are going to die!
Hey, guys!
Guys!
Will the three of you calm down?
How could he lie to us?
- We're his best friends.
- Sure.
Maybe he lied 'cause he didn't want to tell us the truth.
OK, yeah, whatever.
Whatever.
Let's just go back to the boat, then.
The fierce, the proud, the wild...
Rubbish!
But wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait!
Where you goin'?
Stop right there!
Stop!
Bridget, if you go, I'm...
I'm breaking up with you.
We were never going out in the first place.
Then we're taking a break.
- Nigel!
- All right!
Hey, listen!
I know you're scared.
But at least we got each other.
Sammy's got nobody.
He's out there all alone.
And... so is Ryan.
OK, OK, focus, Samson.
He's got to be out there somewhere.
You'll find him.
I mean, how big can this place be, anyway?
Ryan!
Hey there, little fella.
You're lost too, huh?
You remind me of my buddy back home.
A bloodthirsty monster!
Where?
Where?
He's a killer!
Get away from my baby!
Calm down, lady!
Won't anyone save my baby?
Bye-bye.
Ryan!
Ryan!
Sammy!
I wasn't meant for the wild.
I was made to nibble and be elegant and to appear in children's books as the letter G.
Come on, this isn't scary, is it?
It's just leaves and vines and...
Oh, that's my foot.
Nigel, keep a lookout back there.
- You too, Larry!
- Okeydokey.
Oh, I see.
All right, OK, yeah.
You're giving me the silent treatment.
Like I care.
Nigel!
I gave you an order.
Would a little "Sir, yes, sir!" kill ya?
Nigel.
That's not funny, Nigel.
- He's gone!
We're doomed.
- Nigel!
First Ryan, then Samson, and now Nigel!
I do believe in zoos.
- Larry, you're tensing up!
- I do, I do, I do.
- Don't panic.
I'm in charge.
- That's why we're panicking!
I say we fan out and circle.
What are we, peacocks?
We don't fan, we run.
Run for your lives, everybody!
Guys, I've got an idea.
Why don't we ask them?
It's OK...
They, you see, they got hooves.
That means they don't hunt.
They graze.
But they're licking their chops.
I'll take the one with the funny knees.
The funny knee?
Benny, no!
Benny?
Get them.
Just, hey, back off.
I'm sorry,
I'm not that kind of koala bear.
Right.
Excuse me?
Hello?
Terribly sorry to bother you, but do you speak koala?
Sprechen Sie koala?
Right.
Could you possibly not go towards the big smoking thing?
G'day, mate G'day, mate
G'day, mate G'day, mate
G'day, mate G'day, mate
What a strange place for a party.
Very good, very organized.
Can I use your toilet?
I'm having a
Really nice day Really nice day
Really nice day
I'm having a
Really nice day Really nice day
Really nice day
- Why don't you all
- Tickle away, tickle away
They're frighteningly horrible monster beasts but they're not bad dancers.
I'm so cuddly I like you
I'm so cuddly I like you
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
- I'm having a
- Really nice day
Oh, no!
Tickle away Tickle away
I'm so cuddly, I like you Good day
- What is that?
- I am Kazar.
Leader.
Prophet.
Choreographer.
And with your help... carnivore!
No!
Don't kill me!
I've had such a weird life!
This is not fair.
Oh, I get it.
A yoga retreat.
Ryan!
You can do this.
Use your instincts.
Follow your instincts.
Use your instincts.
OK.
Down this way.
This way.
A lion cub.
We must tell Kazar.
- It's my turn to tell him.
- You got to last time.
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!
Thank you very much, but I'm afraid I've got to run.
Koalas are very busy bees.
If I could...
I'll just buzz along to the door...
For centuries, we've watched our brethren perish at the claw of the lion.
Today, we put our hooves down.
No longer will we dwell at the bottom of the food chain.
Well, yes.
I should say so.
There were those who doubted that you'd arrive to lead us.
But I always believed in the Omen.
The Omen!
Right.
Remind me again?
Sent down by the gods years ago...
Oh, no!
Not you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
Oh, Great Him, you must lead us in our transformation from prey to predator.
Hold it.
I am the Great Him?
- The Great Him?
- Him.
So this is all your fault!
That's it!
You!
- Kazar!
- Kazar!
Don't listen to him!
- Kazar!
Over here!
- Kazar!
Over here!
How dare you interrupt my audience with the Great Him!
But... but we found a lion cub!
- You did?
- Was he with a big lion?
With big hair?
Well, a mullet, really.
Oh, Great Him, you brought two lions with you?
Well, like any Great Him,
I travel with an entourage.
Worry not, Your Himness, I shall have Blag bring the lions here.
And he better not screw this up, like you screwed up my dance number!
I lost count for one verse.
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
Why do we even bother rehearsing?
A good chorus line is so hard to put together.
Take to the skies!
We're taking!
We're taking!
- Find them!
- Yes, sir.
Bring us those lions!
The gods celebrate the fulfillment of the prophecy.
We stamp our hooves in praise of the Great Him!
Holy moly!
Holy moly Holy moly
You are our king!
Looky, looky who's there.
Surprise!
No!
Sorry we're late for dinner!
That's pathetic!
Get off!
- That didn't hurt!
- Stop!
- Ryan!
- No!
I'm coming, son!
Dad?
- Help!
- Let's scram!
- Ryan!
- What are you doing here?
- I can't believe it!
I found you.
- How'd you find me?
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
- Your paw.
- I got trapped in that box.
It's OK, son.
And then I escaped, and I ran into the jungle then those vultures came and tried to kill me.
You wouldn't have been scared.
I was.
- I have to tell you something.
- What?
Listen.
- Get 'em, Dad!
- Run!
Run!
Dad, you should be chasing them!
- Like you used to!
- Those were just stories!
But now's your chance to show me for real!
This way!
- Dad?
What's goin' on?
- Just get up into that tree!
- I think we lost them.
- What's the deal?
They're just a bunch of wimpy donkeys!
You could kick their rumps!
- Ryan, I can't fight them.
- You donkey-chickens!
Get back here!
Ryan!
I can't fight them.
What do you mean?
I was young still just a cub.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Children of all ages.
Samson!
Swallow that fear and stand tall!
Witness the greatest day in our young lion's life!
The day he discovers his roar!
Dad, I can't do it!
Now, go!
Listen as Samson unleashes a roar so mighty, it launches a wildebeest clear off the savannah!
Samson!
Dig deep!
I should have known.
If you'd been born in the wild, you'd know how to roar.
Dad?
Dad!
Dad!
Please!
Dad.
When they shipped me to the zoo, I never wanted anyone to know where I came from.
Especially those closest to me.
I should have told you sooner.
But... all those stories you tell?
I'm so sorry, Ryan.
Everything you told me was a lie?
- Dad!
- Hang on, son.
Help!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Run!
Not so fast, Tigger.
Dad!
Ryan!
Dad!
- Help!
- Ryan.
Help!
Dad!
- Ryan.
- Dad!
Help me!
What?
Wait!
What?
What?
Wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Get off me!
What is goin' on here?
- Stinky does not speak.
- It rolls like a little ball.
Wait.
You guys think I'm a?
- Achtung, Stinky!
- Less talk, more roll.
- Ja.
- Roll!
Roll!
What the?
Hey!
Rolling the dung is good for tight buns!
I'll give you something to roll about!
It's a good thing Bridget didn't see that!
Bridget?
Larry!
They're gone.
I gotta find them!
No!
I gotta find Samson first!
No!
First...
Sam.
Sam!
Bridget!
Larry!
Oh, Ryan!
You're alive!
Good to see you guys.
- Where's my hug?
- Larry.
- There it is.
- It's good to see you too.
What are you guys doing here?
We came here with your father to find you.
And he's probably out there right now lookin' for us.
I wish he were.
But some of these wildebeests pushed him off a cliff.
- What?
- What?
I don't think he made it.
I don't see how he could.
Oh, Ryan.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Kazar, I think you'll be very pleased with what I brought you.
What's this?
Where's the other lion?
Right.
Well, I was gonna tell you, there was this cliff and...
Why are you looking at me like that?
That's twice you've been out of step today, Blag!
You klutz.
You know we can't ascend to the top of the food chain until we eat a lion!
Well, at least there'll be enough for my ascension.
What about the rest of us?
Step-kick, pivot-kick!
Ouch!
I twisted a hoof!
You work and you work.
Then they break your heart.
- There goes my career!
- Prepare the sacrifices!
Why did I let him go off by himself?
He couldn't catch a cold, much less his own lunch.
Bet I could catch you.
Please.
My natural predator is fuel inject...
What?
I knew you weren't really gone.
I knew it!
Come on, I knew it!
We're still buddies, right?
I lost Ryan.
There were too many.
They just took him.
Who?
Who took him?
- Wildebeests.
- The freaks with the hooves!
They got Larry and Bridget too.
Couldn't fight, couldn't...
Come on, Sam.
You're a lion.
You come from a long line of kings.
Yeah, maybe you're not from the wild.
But fighting's in your blood!
No.
I'll never be a real lion.
Wrong!
You are a real lion.
Doesn't matter where you're from:
Zoo, jungle, goldfish bowl.
It's what's in here.
That determines who you are!
At least, that's what you always told your son.
Now he's out there, Sammy, and he needs you.
Who else is gonna teach him how to roar?
That's it, Sammy.
That's it.
Let's go find my son...
and my friends.
Yeah!
Nothing's gonna stop us!
Except that we have no idea where we're going!
Follow your instincts.
Follow your instincts.
- What is that?
- My... instincts?
- Benny?
- You're almost there.
That settles it, then.
My mother definitely drank pool water when she was pregnant with me.
Benny, look.
The freaks with hooves!
Ryan's in there.
You can't just barge in.
That's suicide!
- Benny, get out of my way!
- Don't listen to the rat.
- Hey, who are you calling a rat?
- You, of course.
- You'll give away our position.
- I'll have you written up for that!
Fool!
You blew our cover!
Men!
Scatter!
Not so fast!
Look who I got, Sammy.
It's your lion instincts.
Who are you guys?
- Our names aren't important.
- I'm Cloak.
He's Camo.
- We're covert agents.
- Why have you been leading me around?
- That's classified.
- Top-secret.
- The wildebeests have gone mad.
- Cloak.
It's not like I told them our plan is to use them to defeat Kazar's...
Listen, just tell me, did they take my son in there?
- That's need-to-know.
- They did.
- They think the koala's a god.
- You're the worst covert agent!
Oh, yeah?
Then why can I do this?
Men!
Hey!
No!
Stop!
Sammy!
- Idiot!
That maneuver's confidential.
- It's secret.
This one's confidential.
- Cloak!
- And this one's restricted.
Super-secret.
Top-secret.
This is ultra-secret!
Enough!
No more!
Show 'em the super-top-secret "no more?" Gotcha!
No!
I got an idea.
Who is this Great Him, anyway?
I'll take him on.
I'm the Great Her!
I'll show Him a thing or two.
I'm from New York City, for Pete's sake.
Oh, my.
You have got to be kidding me.
Nigel, I don't know what you're trying to pull,
- but I will kick your...
- Silence!
Why, you little...
Silence, again!
You do not speak to me!
Nigel, what's the deal?
Great Him, shall we prepare the feast?
Yes, we shall!
What's on the menu?
Them.
Oh, no.
Eat friends and be god, don't eat friends...
God, friends, god, friends.
God, I...
Well, that was subtle.
Prepare the meat fire!
Wait!
We cannot cook them without onion!
Onions.
Onions.
Onions.
Well, that was fast.
Let the ritual begin.
Move it!
I am so mad at you!
Wait!
We also need... hats!
Do we not have the party hats of death?
I've got mine!
And before the feast, we must all...
What the?
...levitate and spin uncontrollably!
And feel a bit sick.
How do I stop this thing?
- Guys.
- Benny?
- Look, a squirrel!
- Larry!
We've got a plan.
Follow me.
- We?
- I can fly!
Oh, Great Him, we are humbled by your power.
Be humbled.
Only the Great Him can do this!
- Volcanic gas!
- Our cover's blown!
Major malfunction!
Abandon ship!
- Oh, boy.
- Well, about time you got here.
Great Him, it's another miracle!
You've delivered us a real lion!
Blag, your luck has turned.
Thanks to the Great Him, we shall all ascend tonight.
Nigel, we've got to create a distraction.
Hang on a sec!
I've got miracles comin' out my ears!
Ready?
Stand back as the Great Me attacks the lion over 73 times my size!
Dad?
My dad's alive!
Guys, my dad made it!
- Ryan, no!
- Hurry, I got to see him!
Whack, whack, whack!
- Dad!
- What?
Ryan!
- I planned this.
- Ryan, no!
At long last, the cosmic balance has shifted.
- Stay close.
- Prey has become predator!
And predator has become prey!
And the hoof finally trumps the claw!
Come on, Dad!
Let's show these turkey-jerkies who's at the top of the food chain!
Let's eat the brat first.
Over my dead body!
Yeah.
Dad!
He's gonna kill Samson if we don't do something!
Why don't we use the secret play?
I know.
Shut up, Larry.
That's stupid.
No!
It's brilliant!
They laughed at me when I spoke of the Omen.
But look who's laughing now!
Little to the left.
Yeah.
No!
Little to the right!
Next floor: bottom of the food chain!
Ding!
Fire!
We gotta find something bigger!
I know where we can find something bigger.
- Ready, Ryan?
- Dig deep!
You should have stayed at home.
Now our shrine will become your tomb.
Fire!
Ryan!
Ryan!
I don't typically eat dessert before the main course!
Get away from my son!
Ryan.
Ryan, are you still with me?
It's OK, Dad.
I just want you to know
I'm sorry you didn't have a father like the one I have.
Ryan.
How touching.
But then, last words usually are.
Finish them.
What are you doing?
I command you to attack them, like true predators!
We're tired of pretending to be something we're not.
But most of all, we're tired of you.
Blag.
Fine.
I'll kill them myself!
Dad, remember what you always told me in your stories:
Dig deep.
Oh, yeah, baby!
Let's go.
Yeah.
- Come on, let's get out of here!
- Get out of here!
And for the record, I've always hated your choreography.
It's so... '80s.
That's right!
Run!
Run like the cowardly prey that you are!
I will hunt you down!
Everyone!
To the boat!
Top of the food chain, Ma!
Top of the food chain...
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
Hurry!
We're never gonna make it!
Push, you crazy, hairy monsters!
Push!
- Larry, throw it in reverse!
- Reverse throwing!
At least I saw the wild before it disappeared.
I can still see it.
It's right...
Here.
I found my roar.
We both did, son.
You know, Dad, this'll be our first story of Samson and Ryan the Wild.
I don't think anybody's gonna believe it.
Incoming!
I'm so cuddly!
Cuddly!
I'm so cuddly!
I know you're cuddly.
But can you float?
- I'm having a
- Really nice day
Really nice day Really nice day
Step-kick left!
Really nice day
Step-kick right!
- Splendid.
- No!
Smashing.
Hey!
- Stupendous!
- Are you guys sure about this?
Operation Snake-Over is now complete.
Hey, look, everyone!
I'm a secret agent!
Bridget, I get it.
You're more than a tall, lanky goddess.
You're a strong, independent female.
You don't need to be defined by your relationship
- and I, I respect that.
- It's about time.
What was that?
Just your daily dose of vitamin Bridget, baby.
Oh, yeah yeah!
Really nice day Really nice day
Look out!
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
Yes!
Did y'all see that?
Check this!
Go, Blag!
Go, Blag!
Go, Blag!
Hey, Blag.
- No parking' on the dance floor.
- Parkin'?
Dad?
Make some room there, big guy!
Really nice day Really, really nice day
Yeah!
Pretty crazy, right?
Pretty wild!
Well, technically, it...
It's awesome.
Yes, right.
- I was just gonna say that.
- Come on!
Everyone!
This is gonna be a long ride home.
I'm havin' a
Really nice day Really nice day, really nice day
- I'm having a
- I'm so cuddly, I like you
G'day
What are you doing this for?
What, do you think it's funny?
Just get out.
Sorry about that, everybody.
Sorry.
Hello.
Do carry on.
Come on!
All right, everybody exit in an orderly...
All right, single file!
Keep it...
I seem to do a lot of falling and screaming in this adventure.
So there I was, face to face with the biggest, meanest leopard on this side of the Serengeti.
And...
You roared so loud, his spots flew clean off.
Dad, I've heard this like a billion times.
Do you know the one where I made the laughing hyenas...
Cry?
Yep.
- The croc attack?
- Dad.
OK.
Think.
Yeah, you do that.
All right, Mr. Smart Guy, here's one I know you haven't heard.
It all started in the little place I like to call the wild.
They were the fastest wildebeests on the savannah.
We're talking fast.
All the other lions had given up the hunt hours ago, except your old man.
Fortunately, I knew a short cut.
I thought I had 'em.
Until the dust cleared.
Classic wildebeest trap.
So, what did you do next?
- What did I do?
- Yeah.
That's when I gave them the roar.
- That's it?
- Hold on a sec.
I only thought it was over.
But they had a secret weapon.
He was the biggest wildebeest I've ever seen.
- He was 14 feet tall!
- Fourteen?
I meant 1,401 feet tall!
Cool.
And he had two...
No, four of the biggest horns I'd ever seen.
- Whoa!
- His breath was red hot!
I mean, green.
And he hated the environment.
To pull this off, I knew I was gonna have to dig deep, deeper than I ever had before.
So I swallowed my fear, sucked in the biggest breath I could.
Dad, I'm ready!
- You got it?
- I got it!
- I got it!
- Well, let him have it!
Roar, son!
Story of my life.
Your roar stops a herd of wildebeests.
Mine makes the babies laugh.
Hey, come on.
That was much better.
I'm serious!
It dropped half an octave.
It dropped half an octave.
And it sure scared me.
- Made my hair stand up on end.
- Yeah, right, Dad.
- OK.
Let's take it from the top.
- I'm done for today.
Come on, come on, one more.
You were so close.
Maybe it's something technical.
Maybe you're not opening your mouth wide enough.
Like this.
Dad, thanks for the technical help, but if you wanted me to roar like you, you'd take me to the wild.
Hold on a second.
We've got everything we could ever want here.
Great lifestyle, three squares a day.
- It's boring.
- Boring?
- I'll never learn how to roar here.
- Ryan.
But don't worry.
I finally figured out
- how we can get to the wild.
- You did?
The pigeons say those green boxes go there.
Those boxes are bad news.
Stay away.
- But, Dad...
- I know you're frustrated,
- but a lion finds his roar...
- Here.
I'm so tired of hearing that, Dad!
It's a rat!
Get that rat off my baby!
A rat?
Hello!
Silly, silly rat.
- Rats do not got bling like this, lady.
- You little...!
Lastly, that is the ugliest baby I've ever seen!
Benny, stealing candy from a baby?
Stealing is such a strong word.
I prefer "liberating."
Hey, kid, heard the roar.
Down another...
- Octave.
- Octave!
You ready to cheer me and your old man as we capture our fifth straight turtle-curling title?
I can't even roar.
How would you even know I'm there?
So, you really think it dropped an octave?
Absolutely.
- What the heck is an octave?
- I heard that.
- Rabbit.
- Cholesterol.
I'll stick with the nuts.
I don't know what his problem is, Benny.
He's 11, but he's still roaring at a nine-year-old level.
Little help here, Sammy?
You know what?
Maybe you're setting the bar too high, with all those stories about Samson the Wild.
Hey, he's always loved those stories!
They inspire him.
OK.
I'm not gonna argue with someone who can use my tail as dental floss.
- You got something right there.
- Where?
- No, no, other side.
- Here?
- Sorry, Benny.
- You got it.
Attention, friends.
Stop by the gift shop and get the most popular plush in America:
Nigel, the "l-Like-You" Koala.
- Look, honey!
The crazy thing talks!
- I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
That's right.
He's so cuddly.
And better yet, he likes you.
Finally.
And the zoo will officially be ours in T-minus three two and showtime!
Here I come!
Who put that bar there?
That tickles!
- Did too!
- Did not!
- Did too!
- Did not!
Out of my way, ya bum!
There's that moth-eaten koala!
I've told you flamingos a hundred times, walk.
- How about an autograph?
!
- Don't...
Birds!
Find the string on his back!
- So you're havin' a really nice day!
- Guys.
Off my co-captain, now.
Sorry, Samson.
That didn't hurt.
I almost forgot to tell you.
I'm gonna ask Bridget out finally.
Slow down, Romeo.
You are a squirrel and she is...
Perfect, right?
Look, I know what you're sayin'.
Believe me, I got my eyes wide open.
Watch where you're goin', you big...!
Bridget.
Don't stare at my spots, Benny.
My eyes are up here.
Of course.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, this is for you, honey.
It goes around your left hoof.
Did you get that out of the trash?
You did!
You trash-picker!
I'm not a trash-picker.
I'm a recycler.
That's a lot more romantic.
Isn't it?
- Romantic?
- Sam, come here.
Romantic?
Don't mention romance to me, Benny.
- I've never had a boyfriend.
- That settles it.
I accept the job...
of boyfriend number one.
Benny, only the female orb-weaver spider will date a male one-twentieth her size.
- So there's hope!
- And then she eats him.
But at least he dies happy.
Let's get Ryan, dude!
Dude!
We said that at the same time!
Dude.
Hey!
Hey, Ryan.
Listen, I'm headin' down to the game.
I'm gonna see you there, right?
Come on, Ryan.
We need you.
You're our biggest fan.
Yo, Samson!
I'm your number one fan, man!
Thanks, man.
Right back at ya!
You were saying, Dad?
Listen.
About this afternoon, I was just trying...
Dad, fine.
I'll go to your game, all right?
OK.
I'II... see you there, then.
Come on, dude.
- Dude.
- Guess who's here?
Eze.
Duke.
Man, he always guesses.
We're gonna stalk the gazelles while everybody's at the game.
- You in?
- Let's go, bro!
The Ryanator.
I'm comin' down.
Fish heads!
Get your ice-cold fish heads!
Now eyeball-free!
We're into the final period of the curling championships and the penguins are up.
Here comes Victor.
What a beauty!
Yeah, sweep!
Heading straight for the bull's-eye!
This could be it, folks!
- Bo-wango!
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah!
- That's gonna be tough to beat.
What? "Tough to beat"?
That's just the way we like it, right, guys?
I can't believe this!
If we lose, I'm gonna rip my head off!
And yours!
We cannot lose to flightless birds!
Whoa, whoa.
No one is losing anything around here.
As long as we stay focused.
- By the way, has anyone seen Ryan?
- Oh!
I know!
Maybe he's sulking 'cause he lives in his father's shadow and he roars like a schoolgirl.
- Thanks, Lar.
- You betcha!
Nigel!
Nigel!
Will you sign my dolly?
- Not again.
- Nigel, ignore them.
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
- You're so cuddly!
We love you!
- That's it!
I am not cuddly!
I'm a vicious jungle animal from the streets of London!
- Fear me!
- Get him!
Get him!
Get him!
- Help me!
- Girls!
Put him down.
I am not a doll!
- Cushy tushy!
- Leave my bum alone!
Nigel!
Get your paws off my girlfriend!
Benny, I am not your girlfriend!
Really nice day!
What is up with Samson's team tonight?
Brutal!
Benny?
Oh, my gosh!
Who knows mouth-to-mouth?
I do!
What was that?
Just your daily dose of vitamin Benny, baby.
- Get off my nose.
- I'm so cuddly, I like you!
- Stop saying that!
- G'day, mate!
Cannonball!
Next year, I should just coach.
Check it.
The Thomson gazelle.
Zero to 50 in four-point-five seconds.
- The ultimate fleeing machine.
- There is no substitute.
Let's get a closer look at these slim jims.
- Shall we?
- I think we shall.
Maybe we should just go to the game.
- I thought you wanted to be wild.
- Your dad chased gazelles.
Yeah, if he were our age, he would so be rockin' out with us.
He'd be in there, runnin' 'em down like they were...
- Gazelles.
- Yeah, gazelles or somethin'.
Ready, man?
We'd better not.
Oh, yeah?
Are you gonna stop us?
- Guys, guys.
- Here we go!
The whole series comes down to this throw!
There's no tomorrow!
It's do or die!
Ya know what I mean.
Guys, I know we're down, but we're gonna pull this out 'cause we're gonna use the secret play.
- The secret play!
Hey, everybody, guess what?
We're gonna use the secret play!
Larry, the first part of the secret play is keeping it secret.
- OK.
- Follow my lead.
I'm going to need a double effort from everybody.
Absolutely, captain.
Triple effort if you want, sir.
- Good.
Ready, and...
- Break!
Quiet.
On three, dude.
One, two...
No!
Now you did it, Ryan.
Feelin' mean, Donald?
Bring it on!
Folks, there's pressure on the big guy!
- Ready, Bridget?
- Ready.
- Ready, Benny?
- Ready!
Samson, it's a shame your little brat isn't here to see you lose.
I can't... hold it!
Oh, no!
What are you doin'?
And here comes Samson.
Look at that guy.
Is he a beauty or what?
Larry!
Bridget!
Sweep!
What a recovery!
He's sendin' in Bridget and Larry to do the job!
Sweep faster, Larry!
Sweep, sweep!
- I am!
- Come on, man!
Team Penguin is sending their ace, Victor...
- Watch it, Victor!
- Watch it yourself, see?
Nigel, how are we looking?
- This could be trouble, folks!
- Sweep, sweep, sweep.
This is cheating and you will die for this.
I can't hear you, Nigel.
Move left a bit...
OK.
Move left and hit!
- Larry, no!
- Tallyho!
What a move!
Folks, we are inches away from the greatest upset in turtle-curling history!
- Oh, no!
I can't believe my eyes!
- No!
Looks like Samson might have choked!
- Nice!
- Yes!
Unbelievable!
Samson and his team have clinched the title!
- No, wait!
I've called it too soon!
- What the heck?
The penguins have done it!
They're zoo champs for the first time!
Stampede?
Stampede!
Please!
Stop!
Watch out!
Dude.
Busted.
Catastrophic.
Told you I'd come to the game.
You think this is funny?
You just endangered everyone in the zoo!
- I'm sorry.
- For what?
Chasing the gazelles or costing us the game?
All you do is sit up in your tree and sulk.
- If you just...
- What's the problem?
Is all this because you can't roar?
Ryan, I didn't mean that.
Know what I'm doing when I'm sulking in my tree?
I'm thinking how great it would be if Samson the Wild wasn't my father.
Ryan, I didn't...
'Cause it would make being Ryan the Lame a lot easier.
Ryan, I'm sorry.
Ryan!
Please don't leave.
Bye, Ryan!
Thanks for coming to the game.
And you were worried he wouldn't show up.
Not good.
No one listens to the squirrel.
I don't know what to do anymore, Benny.
- I've tried everything.
- Everything?
- You tried everything?
- What are you saying?
I'm saying you have to tell him the truth.
I don't think I could do that, Benny.
I mean...
What's he gonna think of me when he finds out?
I don't know.
But if you don't tell him you're gonna lose him, Sammy.
The green boxes.
OK, they're all loaded up!
- You don't think I know that?
- Get movin'!
I changed my mind!
I don't wanna go!
Help!
Ryan.
Help me!
Watch out!
Sam!
- Wait for us!
- Dad!
- Ryan!
- Dad!
Don't let them take me!
- No!
- Ryan!
Help!
- No!
- Dad!
Help me!
Ryan!
- Benny, we need that truck followed.
- Check.
Get me... the pigeons.
I am wanting snake eyes!
Come on, baby.
Come on, just throw it.
Thanks.
Hamir!
You are the great loser of all time!
What offerings must I make, I wonder?
Hamir!
Hamir!
Get a grip on yourself!
Benny!
I am needing till Friday before I am paying you back!
No, no.
It's Ryan.
He's in one of those green boxes and they took it away!
We've got to find him!
That is not good!
Not good at all!
I know!
I know!
I am telling him, you crazy pigeon!
The green boxes go to the big water where stiff lady with spikes on her head...
- Hamir?
I can't understand...
- Spikes!
Just tell me where the green boxes go.
Stiff lady, spikies?
Yes, like my wife says, the truck takes them to her!
To her!
Though I hate telling bad news, there is more bad news to tell.
When the sun rises, the green boxes leave on boat-boat and never return!
I am sorry for this.
I really am.
Hello?
No.
Not good.
Not good.
You always say that.
I keep on sayin' it.
No one's listenin'.
Like a broken record here.
OK.
When do we leave, Sammy?
Yeah, when do we leave?
It's not "we." It's me.
Let's make this clear.
This is now a rescue mission and I am the only one going.
We'll come too!
We're not afraid.
Are we, guys?
Afraid?
No.
You know koalas.
More like "scared of things."
Ryan's like a cub to all of us.
Not that I'll ever have one of my own at this rate.
You know, there's that famous...
A koala once said,
"We will fight them... with peaches."
Yeah.
Anyway.
- So we're helping, whatever it takes.
- You want to leave with me?
OK.
If you don't mind being hunted down, shot at stuffed...
- OK!
...or worse, then fine.
I have a recurring nightmare about taxidermy and spot remover.
Well, they have to catch us before they can stuff us and I'm fast.
Nobody's leaving but me.
Got it?
- You're the boss.
- You bet.
- You got the big hair.
- Absolutely.
Yeah, that's good, Sammy.
Hey, way to weed out the weak links.
Now that they're out of the picture, what's the plan?
Don't worry about a thing, big guy.
I got it all taken care of.
I know this city like the back of my paw.
We ditch this truck at Fifth Avenue, couple lefts, couple rights, bada-boom, past Broadway and...
You're there!
What are you doing here?
- What?
- We're going to help you find Ryan!
She said, "We're gonna help you find Ryan."
- Oh, great.
- Hey, guys.
I've got popcorn up my bum.
Do I look trashy in this?
OK, here's my...
Here's my overall plan.
Where are we going?
I only have until sunrise before Ryan is taken away forever!
And now I have to worry about you three?
All right, fine.
When do we get off of this thing, Benny?
Benny's here?
Yeah, he's right there.
Benny?
Benny!
Great.
Now what am I gonna do?
Guys!
Guys!
I think we should duck!
What is she saying?
She said, "Duck down!"
Duck!
I am not in the mood for a game of footsie or hoofsie or pawsie or...
That wasn't my paw.
It was this!
I didn't steal it.
I borrowed it.
It'll light the way to Ryan.
The walls are moving.
Right, right.
The walls...
The walls are moving!
Larry, hold your breath!
Larry, stay straight!
Everybody out!
All right, don't panic.
What we've got to do...
This is definitely not good.
Samson!
- Give me your hoof!
- Help!
Larry!
The garbage!
It lives!
Guys?
OK, anybody?
I'm freakin' out.
- What's the hold up?
- Hello?
We're over here, Nigel.
Right.
I'll be there in a minute.
Think.
What did Benny say?
Couple of lefts, couple of rights.
Bridget, can you see the green lady?
I'm looking, I'm looking, but I can't see over anything for a change.
How far are you away?
You in a different continent?
Is that you, Larry?
Up here, Nige.
You're a very furry snake.
Guys...
We don't want to draw attention to ourselves.
Dogs.
This should be fun for you, Samson.
Nigel!
Grab Bridget!
- What?
- Run!
I'm gonna throw up!
I'm gonna throw up!
Shouldn't you be tearing them to shreds?
All part of the plan.
This maneuver's known as the Serengeti Slip.
Page ten of the Predator's Playbook.
What next?
Page 11?
Go on, you mutts!
Stupid dogs, we could've taken you.
Taken you to a...
To a disco!
Larry, improvise!
- Larry, that's not helping.
- OK.
You dogs think you got bark?
Well, Samson's got roar!
- Show 'em, Sam.
- Dig deep, Samson.
You're a lion.
Be a lion.
Look at that guy!
Sam, they are frothing at the mouth.
OK...
- Larry, coil!
- Check!
- Sam!
- I improvised.
Now jump!
- Down there?
- Yes!
We're leaving, Larry!
Teensy question, Samson.
With those dogs up there, why didn't you just do what you did in the wild?
You know, lionize 'em or lionate them or lionify them?
I don't have time to fight dogs, Bridget.
We have to find Ryan, remember?
What is this stinky place?
It appears to be a human bathing area.
You mean humans don't lick themselves clean?
Disgusting!
They're hopeless.
It is hard to believe they are at the top of the food chain.
I can't imagine beginning the day without licking myself.
No hurry, but is there a plan?
Of course there's a plan.
We follow this water to the big water, and then we find the lady with...
Larry, either your stomach is growling or something in it is growling.
Wasn't me.
What?
- Smooth move, Nigel!
- Oh, boy!
Twins!
OK, Sammy, hurry it up now, 'cause these guys are seeming to have acid reflux or something!
Everybody... stay calm.
- Calm?
- Not good.
Yo.
Boo!
I'm gonna say, it looks like you and your crew here are a little far from your borough.
Far from your borough!
I love it.
We're going to the big water.
Nigel, show them what we're looking for.
- Like this?
- I think it's in her right hand.
- And isn't she blue?
- I can't do blue.
- No idea.
You?
- Doesn't even register.
- You're batting' zero, kid.
- Do the thing with...
Make your bloody mind up.
The big female with the spikes on her melon!
They're tourists.
All right, tourists, listen up.
Ya gotta get to Battery Park.
First take the Broadway culvert.
- Down the Broadway culvert?
- What's wrong with that?
- They get lost at the sewage plant!
- Get outta here!
- What are you talking about?
- How would you send 'em?
You're sendin' 'em the wrong way!
The Wall Street culvert is blocked with construction.
- That is true.
- All right.
Guys, you gonna help or not?
Yeah, sure.
Of course we're gonna help ya's.
We're one big family, right?
Except for that guy there.
He scares the...
You done runnin' your mouth yet, Carmine?
Are ya?
I apologize.
He never got over being flushed down the toilet.
Yeah.
Follow me, 'cause you four won't last ten minutes in this neighborhood.
It's a jungle down here.
- Stan, you know who that is?
- What?
No.
That's one of them talkin' kawana bears!
How ya doing?
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I've seen a lot of those things floating' here in the sewer.
That's good!
You're makin' me laugh over here.
Just wait for me!
Are we in the right place?
Any place without two hilarious alligators seems a move in the right direction.
- Sam, do you see anything up there?
- I sure do.
Well, well, well.
There she is, like Hamir said.
And it's sunrise, which means we're a tad short on time.
Guys, look.
We know the box Ryan's in is green.
It's gotta be around here, so I need you to...
Yeah.
So we should shout out if we see a box that looks like the ones over there.
It hasn't left yet!
We can make it!
- Let's go!
- Hold on, Larry!
- Which way now?
- Yeah, which way?
Run!
No!
No!
Ryan's on that thing!
We've got to stop it!
- We can't, Sam!
- I don't care!
- No, Sammy, you'll drown!
- Sam!
I failed.
Again.
I only count one failure.
It's big, but it's just one.
Goodbye, Ryan.
We're gonna miss ya.
- Samson!
- What on earth is going on?
It's a human and I do not think he works for the zoo.
Perhaps now is a good time to improvise.
What?
Great!
One problem down...
Far out.
Cool.
One disaster to go.
What are you doing?
We're headed for the other boat!
How do we steer?
Who knows how to steer?
None of us.
We're animals.
Great!
- Hold on, Larry.
Do that again.
- Do what?
Whatever you just did, but the opposite!
But I don't know my opposites!
No, Larry, like this!
I think I've got it.
Well, that was easy.
Oh, dear.
Has anyone got any eucalyptus wipes?
This isn't so difficult.
I'm the lion of the sea!
Well done, sir.
Captain of our team and now captain of this vessel.
You're brilliant.
I hate to be Miss Negative, but in this melee, we seem to have lost Ryan's boat.
- What, nothing?
- Nothing.
He's gone.
No.
There!
Nelson!
The green boxes!
- You're sure, eh?
- And there's my buddies!
And my love!
Let's go in!
- We'll head away from the sun.
- No, towards the sun.
To the north.
Starboard...
Leftboard.
Just follow my finger.
Please.
You guys wouldn't know the answer if it fell from the sky and hit you in the head.
Oh, my!
It's a bat!
It's a bat!
Get it off me!
Get it off me!
- Benny!
- Benny?
Geese!
- Are you all right?
- Yes, my princess.
Benny, you made it!
You're my best friend.
Best friends should stick together.
Even not-so-best friends, who knock you off a speeding garbage truck.
Excuse me, but I begged them to go back and get you.
Just so you know.
Benny, could you see Ryan's boat from up there?
Well, it just so happens I saw it heading that way.
And we're in luck!
- How's it goin', eh?
- Canadian geese!
Experts at intercontinental travel.
Hey, birdie, OK, is it true that Canada has lax immigration policies for koalas?
I'll take it from here.
My son's out there.
We really need your help.
Can you lead us to that boat?
No problem, eh?
Just follow us and Bob's your uncle.
Try not to lag too far behind, eh?
Hey, Benny, thanks.
And FYI, Bridget was very concerned when you fell off the truck.
Bet you didn't know I could ride geese, did you?
- Bareback.
- Oh, brother.
Sammy?
We going to the wild now?
I think we are, Larry.
I can't take it anymore.
He's taunting us!
Listen!
Stop laughing at us, you solar twit!
Captain Bligh, sir!
Are the ice cream cones ready?
The crew, they're on the verge of mutiny.
Nigel, please.
If you don't give us ice creams pretty quick, you're gonna walk the plank, sir!
- Nigel.
- I don't care if I drown,
I'm getting off this death cruise right now.
Iceberg!
Permission to go down with the ship, sir.
Hang on!
Stuff that!
Run!
Swim!
Nigel?
Look, I'm a starfish.
Guys, look.
Gosh.
Must feel like a lifetime since you've been here.
Yeah... a lifetime.
What the heck?
Wow!
Look!
They're releasing the green boxes back into the wild.
- Larry.
- Guys, they're putting animals inside the green boxes.
I just can't figure out why.
It's a tunnel to another dimension, can't you see?
- They go in...
- Who is this guy?
It's all right, Nigel.
Think it has anything to do with that?
Hang on a second.
Either I'm starving or Larry is making sense.
You're right.
Those animals are being rescued.
Ryan?
Ryan!
Oh, no!
Ryan!
We've got to move fast!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Where are you, buddy?
Ryan!
- I can't believe it!
- Samson!
I was so close.
He was right there!
- We'll never find him now!
- Come here!
Will you get a hold of yourself?
Use your instincts.
I don't want to run anymore.
Good. 'Cause frankly, you need a good sports bra.
- Ryan?
- Everything's under control.
- Temporary setback.
- I got it.
- I got Ryan's scent!
- He got it?
I mean, he got it!
Let's go!
- Hooray!
- Wait for us!
I'm not designed for this!
I want a car.
Hey, guys, I found him!
Ryan!
Doesn't anyone knock anymore?
Where's my son?
Did he come through here?
Yeah, now that I think about it, he did come through here.
Hello?
Come on out, baby lion!
Your dad's here!
Well, what do you know?
There's a whole pride of lions here!
Funky.
I was under the impression you had Ryan's scent, not this olfactory insult.
I...
I had Ryan's scent, but my predator instincts must've kicked in since, you know, I haven't eaten for a while.
Exactly!
You never know when those instincts are gonna kick in.
Excellent.
Fantastic!
We get to see the legend in action.
I'd love to, but we just don't have time.
We got the time, Sammy.
Just...
And then you do this.
And then this bit.
Rip him apart!
The horror.
I can't bear to watch!
But I have to.
Go on.
Get out of here.
- The legend dropped his dinner.
- Oh, boy.
What's wrong?
I'm not good enough for you to eat?
No.
It's just I'm allergic to nuts.
Now I get it.
You're gonna toy with me?
Beat me up a little, then pounce when I get my hopes up?
How exciting.
Come on, guys.
Ryan can't be far.
Hey!
I'm not finished with you!
I am a delicacy.
My flesh has fruity wood notes!
Watch it, you little hors d'oeuvre.
That's Samson the Wild.
You call this wild?
This is a cat!
A big, fat, tame pussycat!
- OK, that's enough!
- The pussycat hissed at me!
Maybe I should hide behind the koala for protection.
While we're at it, could you slap me in the face?
No.
What are you, a twit?
- Ignore him.
- Don't bother!
I'm leaving.
- You're weird.
- Run for your lives!
It's a lion with moral issues!
And I've had it with you too!
Thanks a lot for wrecking my day!
Teensy question.
Or more like a...
a sort of a query meets a statement.
That hyrax back there?
It was sort of like you couldn't eat him.
Yeah, and what about those dogs?
There was no munching there, either.
If I didn't know any better, I'd say that you're...
- A vegetarian?
- Nope.
- That's not what I was going to say.
- You were going to say...
- It's almost like...
- You're not from...
The wild?
Well, you're right.
I'm not from the wild.
What?
I'm just a phony.
Truth is I can't protect you out here.
Please just go back to the boat.
I've got to find my son.
Tell me we're not in a dangerous jungle with an 8-inch squirrel protecting us.
Actually, I'm nine inches, but other than that, yes.
So that means...
We are going to die!
Hey, guys!
Guys!
Will the three of you calm down?
How could he lie to us?
- We're his best friends.
- Sure.
Maybe he lied 'cause he didn't want to tell us the truth.
OK, yeah, whatever.
Whatever.
Let's just go back to the boat, then.
The fierce, the proud, the wild...
Rubbish!
But wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait!
Where you goin'?
Stop right there!
Stop!
Bridget, if you go, I'm...
I'm breaking up with you.
We were never going out in the first place.
Then we're taking a break.
- Nigel!
- All right!
Hey, listen!
I know you're scared.
But at least we got each other.
Sammy's got nobody.
He's out there all alone.
And... so is Ryan.
OK, OK, focus, Samson.
He's got to be out there somewhere.
You'll find him.
I mean, how big can this place be, anyway?
Ryan!
Hey there, little fella.
You're lost too, huh?
You remind me of my buddy back home.
A bloodthirsty monster!
Where?
Where?
He's a killer!
Get away from my baby!
Calm down, lady!
Won't anyone save my baby?
Bye-bye.
Ryan!
Ryan!
Sammy!
I wasn't meant for the wild.
I was made to nibble and be elegant and to appear in children's books as the letter G.
Come on, this isn't scary, is it?
It's just leaves and vines and...
Oh, that's my foot.
Nigel, keep a lookout back there.
- You too, Larry!
- Okeydokey.
Oh, I see.
All right, OK, yeah.
You're giving me the silent treatment.
Like I care.
Nigel!
I gave you an order.
Would a little "Sir, yes, sir!" kill ya?
Nigel.
That's not funny, Nigel.
- He's gone!
We're doomed.
- Nigel!
First Ryan, then Samson, and now Nigel!
I do believe in zoos.
- Larry, you're tensing up!
- I do, I do, I do.
- Don't panic.
I'm in charge.
- That's why we're panicking!
I say we fan out and circle.
What are we, peacocks?
We don't fan, we run.
Run for your lives, everybody!
Guys, I've got an idea.
Why don't we ask them?
It's OK...
They, you see, they got hooves.
That means they don't hunt.
They graze.
But they're licking their chops.
I'll take the one with the funny knees.
The funny knee...?
Benny, no!
Benny?
Get them.
Just, hey, back off.
I'm sorry,
I'm not that kind of koala bear.
Right.
Excuse me?
Hello?
Terribly sorry to bother you, but do you speak koala?
Sprechen Sie koala?
Right.
Could you possibly not go towards the big smoking thing?
G'day, mate G'day, mate
G'day, mate G'day, mate
G'day, mate G'day, mate
What a strange place for a party.
Very good, very organized.
Can I use your toilet?
I'm having a
Really nice day Really nice day
Really nice day
I'm having a
Really nice day Really nice day
Really nice day
- Why don't you all
- Tickle away, tickle away
They're frighteningly horrible monster beasts but they're not bad dancers.
I'm so cuddly I like you
I'm so cuddly I like you
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
- I'm having a
- Really nice day
Oh, no!
Tickle away Tickle away
I'm so cuddly, I like you Good day
- What is that?
- I am Kazar.
Leader.
Prophet.
Choreographer.
And with your help... carnivore!
No!
Don't kill me!
I've had such a weird life!
This is not fair.
Oh, I get it.
A yoga retreat.
Ryan!
You can do this.
Use your instincts.
Follow your instincts.
Use your instincts.
OK.
Down this way.
This way.
A lion cub.
We must tell Kazar.
- It's my turn to tell him.
- You got to last time.
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!
Thank you very much, but I'm afraid I've got to run.
Koalas are very busy bees.
If I could...
I'll just buzz along to the door...
For centuries, we've watched our brethren perish at the claw of the lion.
Today, we put our hooves down.
No longer will we dwell at the bottom of the food chain.
Well, yes.
I should say so.
There were those who doubted that you'd arrive to lead us.
But I always believed in the Omen.
The Omen!
Right.
Remind me again?
Sent down by the gods years ago...
Oh, no!
Not you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
Oh, Great Him, you must lead us in our transformation from prey to predator.
Hold it.
I am the Great Him?
- The Great Him?
- Him.
So this is all your fault!
That's it!
You...!
- Kazar!
- Kazar!
Don't listen to him!
- Kazar!
Over here!
- Kazar!
Over here!
How dare you interrupt my audience with the Great Him!
But... but we found a lion cub!
- You did?
- Was he with a big lion?
With big hair?
Well, a mullet, really.
Oh, Great Him, you brought two lions with you?
Well, like any Great Him,
I travel with an entourage.
Worry not, Your Himness, I shall have Blag bring the lions here.
And he better not screw this up, like you screwed up my dance number!
I lost count for one verse.
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
Why do we even bother rehearsing?
A good chorus line is so hard to put together.
Take to the skies!
We're taking!
We're taking!
- Find them!
- Yes, sir.
Bring us those lions!
The gods celebrate the fulfillment of the prophecy.
We stamp our hooves in praise of the Great Him!
Holy moly!
Holy moly Holy moly
You are our king!
Looky, looky who's there.
Surprise!
No!
Sorry we're late for dinner!
That's pathetic!
Get off!
- That didn't hurt!
- Stop!
- Ryan!
- No!
I'm coming, son!
Dad?
- Help!
- Let's scram!
- Ryan!
- What are you doing here?
- I can't believe it!
I found you.
- How'd you find me?
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
- Your paw.
- I got trapped in that box.
It's OK, son.
And then I escaped, and I ran into the jungle then those vultures came and tried to kill me.
You wouldn't have been scared.
I was.
- I have to tell you something.
- What?
Listen.
- Get 'em, Dad!
- Run!
Run!
Dad, you should be chasing them!
- Like you used to!
- Those were just stories!
But now's your chance to show me for real!
This way!
- Dad?
What's goin' on?
- Just get up into that tree!
- I think we lost them.
- What's the deal?
They're just a bunch of wimpy donkeys!
You could kick their rumps!
- Ryan, I can't fight them.
- You donkey-chickens!
Get back here!
Ryan!
I can't fight them.
What do you mean?
I was young still just a cub.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Children of all ages.
Samson!
Swallow that fear and stand tall!
Witness the greatest day in our young lion's life!
The day he discovers his roar!
Dad, I can't do it!
Now, go!
Listen as Samson unleashes a roar so mighty, it launches a wildebeest clear off the savannah!
Samson!
Dig deep!
I should have known.
If you'd been born in the wild, you'd know how to roar.
Dad?
Dad!
Dad!
Please!
Dad.
When they shipped me to the zoo, I never wanted anyone to know where I came from.
Especially those closest to me.
I should have told you sooner.
But... all those stories you tell?
I'm so sorry, Ryan.
Everything you told me was a lie?
- Dad!
- Hang on, son.
Help!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Run!
Not so fast, Tigger.
Dad!
Ryan!
Dad!
- Help!
- Ryan.
Help!
Dad!
- Ryan.
- Dad!
Help me!
What?
Wait!
What?
What?
Wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Get off me!
What is goin' on here?
- Stinky does not speak.
- It rolls like a little ball.
Wait.
You guys think I'm a...?
- Achtung, Stinky!
- Less talk, more roll.
- Ja.
- Roll!
Roll!
What the...?
Hey!
Rolling the dung is good for tight buns!
I'll give you something to roll about!
It's a good thing Bridget didn't see that!
Bridget?
Larry!
They're gone.
I gotta find them!
No!
I gotta find Samson first!
No!
First...
Sam.
Sam!
Bridget!
Larry!
Oh, Ryan!
You're alive!
Good to see you guys.
- Where's my hug?
- Larry.
- There it is.
- It's good to see you too.
What are you guys doing here?
We came here with your father to find you.
And he's probably out there right now lookin' for us.
I wish he were.
But some of these wildebeests pushed him off a cliff.
- What?
- What?
I don't think he made it.
I don't see how he could.
Oh, Ryan.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Kazar, I think you'll be very pleased with what I brought you.
What's this?
Where's the other lion?
Right.
Well, I was gonna tell you, there was this cliff and...
Why are you looking at me like that?
That's twice you've been out of step today, Blag!
You klutz.
You know we can't ascend to the top of the food chain until we eat a lion!
Well, at least there'll be enough for my ascension.
What about the rest of us?
Step-kick, pivot-kick!
Ouch!
I twisted a hoof!
You work and you work.
Then they break your heart.
- There goes my career!
- Prepare the sacrifices!
Why did I let him go off by himself?
He couldn't catch a cold, much less his own lunch.
Bet I could catch you.
Please.
My natural predator is fuel inject...
What?
I knew you weren't really gone.
I knew it!
Come on, I knew it!
We're still buddies, right?
I lost Ryan.
There were too many.
They just took him.
Who?
Who took him?
- Wildebeests.
- The freaks with the hooves!
They got Larry and Bridget too.
Couldn't fight, couldn't...
Come on, Sam.
You're a lion.
You come from a long line of kings.
Yeah, maybe you're not from the wild.
But fighting's in your blood!
No.
I'll never be a real lion.
Wrong!
You are a real lion.
Doesn't matter where you're from:
Zoo, jungle, goldfish bowl.
It's what's in here.
That determines who you are!
At least, that's what you always told your son.
Now he's out there, Sammy, and he needs you.
Who else is gonna teach him how to roar?
That's it, Sammy.
That's it.
Let's go find my son...
and my friends.
Yeah!
Nothing's gonna stop us!
Except that we have no idea where we're going!
Follow your instincts.
Follow your instincts.
- What is that?
- My... instincts?
- Benny?
- You're almost there.
That settles it, then.
My mother definitely drank pool water when she was pregnant with me.
Benny, look.
The freaks with hooves!
Ryan's in there.
You can't just barge in.
That's suicide!
- Benny, get out of my way!
- Don't listen to the rat.
- Hey, who are you calling a rat?
- You, of course.
- You'll give away our position.
- I'll have you written up for that!
Fool!
You blew our cover!
Men!
Scatter!
Not so fast!
Look who I got, Sammy.
It's your lion instincts.
Who are you guys?
- Our names aren't important.
- I'm Cloak.
He's Camo.
- We're covert agents.
- Why have you been leading me around?
- That's classified.
- Top-secret.
- The wildebeests have gone mad.
- Cloak.
It's not like I told them our plan is to use them to defeat Kazar's...
Listen, just tell me, did they take my son in there?
- That's need-to-know.
- They did.
- They think the koala's a god.
- You're the worst covert agent!
Oh, yeah?
Then why can I do this?
Men!
Hey!
No!
Stop!
Sammy!
- Idiot!
That maneuver's confidential.
- It's secret.
This one's confidential.
- Cloak!
- And this one's restricted.
Super-secret.
Top-secret.
This is ultra-secret!
Enough!
No more!
Show 'em the super-top-secret "no more?" Gotcha!
No!
I got an idea.
Who is this Great Him, anyway?
I'll take him on.
I'm the Great Her!
I'll show Him a thing or two.
I'm from New York City, for Pete's sake.
Oh, my.
You have got to be kidding me.
Nigel, I don't know what you're trying to pull,
- but I will kick your...
- Silence!
Why, you little...
Silence, again!
You do not speak to me!
Nigel, what's the deal?
Great Him, shall we prepare the feast?
Yes, we shall!
What's on the menu?
Them.
Oh, no.
Eat friends and be god, don't eat friends...
God, friends, god, friends.
God, I...
Well, that was subtle.
Prepare the meat fire!
Wait!
We cannot cook them without onion!
Onions.
Onions.
Onions.
Well, that was fast.
Let the ritual begin.
Move it!
I am so mad at you!
Wait!
We also need... hats!
Do we not have the party hats of death?
I've got mine!
And before the feast, we must all...
What the...?
...levitate and spin uncontrollably!
And feel a bit sick.
How do I stop this thing?
- Guys.
- Benny?
- Look, a squirrel!
- Larry!
We've got a plan.
Follow me.
- We?
- I can fly!
Oh, Great Him, we are humbled by your power.
Be humbled.
Only the Great Him can do this!
- Volcanic gas!
- Our cover's blown!
Major malfunction!
Abandon ship!
- Oh, boy.
- Well, about time you got here.
Great Him, it's another miracle!
You've delivered us a real lion!
Blag, your luck has turned.
Thanks to the Great Him, we shall all ascend tonight.
Nigel, we've got to create a distraction.
Hang on a sec!
I've got miracles comin' out my ears!
Ready?
Stand back as the Great Me attacks the lion over 73 times my size!
Dad?
My dad's alive!
Guys, my dad made it!
- Ryan, no!
- Hurry, I got to see him!
Whack, whack, whack!
- Dad!
- What?
Ryan!
- I planned this.
- Ryan, no!
At long last, the cosmic balance has shifted.
- Stay close.
- Prey has become predator!
And predator has become prey!
And the hoof finally trumps the claw!
Come on, Dad!
Let's show these turkey-jerkies who's at the top of the food chain!
Let's eat the brat first.
Over my dead body!
Yeah.
Dad!
He's gonna kill Samson if we don't do something!
Why don't we use the secret play?
I know.
Shut up, Larry.
That's stupid.
No!
It's brilliant!
They laughed at me when I spoke of the Omen.
But look who's laughing now!
Little to the left.
Yeah.
No!
Little to the right!
Next floor:
Bottom of the food chain!
Ding!
Fire!
We gotta find something bigger!
I know where we can find something bigger.
- Ready, Ryan?
- Dig deep!
You should have stayed at home.
Now our shrine will become your tomb.
Fire!
Ryan!
Ryan!
I don't typically eat dessert before the main course!
Get away from my son!
Ryan.
Ryan, are you still with me?
It's OK, Dad.
I just want you to know
I'm sorry you didn't have a father like the one I have.
Ryan.
How touching.
But then, last words usually are.
Finish them.
What are you doing?
I command you to attack them, like true predators!
We're tired of pretending to be something we're not.
But most of all, we're tired of you.
Blag.
Fine.
I'll kill them myself!
Dad, remember what you always told me in your stories:
Dig deep.
Oh, yeah, baby!
Let's go.
Yeah.
- Come on, let's get out of here!
- Get out of here!
And for the record, I've always hated your choreography.
It's so... '80s.
That's right!
Run!
Run like the cowardly prey that you are!
I will hunt you down!
Everyone!
To the boat!
Top of the food chain, Ma!
Top of the food chain...
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
Hurry!
We're never gonna make it!
Push, you crazy, hairy monsters!
Push!
- Larry, throw it in reverse!
- Reverse throwing!
At least I saw the wild before it disappeared.
I can still see it.
It's right...
Here.
I found my roar.
We both did, son.
You know, Dad, this'll be our first story of Samson and Ryan the Wild.
I don't think anybody's gonna believe it.
Incoming!
I'm so cuddly!
Cuddly!
I'm so cuddly!
I know you're cuddly.
But can you float?
- I'm having a
- Really nice day
Really nice day Really nice day
Step-kick left!
Really nice day
Step-kick right!
- Splendid.
- No!
Smashing.
Hey!
- Stupendous!
- Are you guys sure about this?
Operation Snake-Over is now complete.
Hey, look, everyone!
I'm a secret agent!
Bridget, I get it.
You're more than a tall, lanky goddess.
You're a strong, independent female.
You don't need to be defined by your relationship
- and I, I respect that.
- It's about time.
What was that?
Just your daily dose of vitamin Bridget, baby.
Oh, yeah yeah!
Really nice day Really nice day
Look out!
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
Yes!
Did y'all see that?
Check this!
Go, Blag!
Go, Blag!
Go, Blag!
Hey, Blag.
- No parking' on the dance floor.
- Parkin'?
Dad?
Make some room there, big guy!
Really nice day Really, really nice day
Yeah!
Pretty crazy, right?
Pretty wild!
Well, technically, it...
It's awesome.
Yes, right.
- I was just gonna say that.
- Come on!
Everyone!
This is gonna be a long ride home.
I'm havin' a
Really nice day Really nice day, really nice day
- I'm having a
- I'm so cuddly, I like you
G'day
What are you doing this for?
What, do you think it's funny?
Just get out.
Sorry about that, everybody.
Sorry.
Hello.
Do carry on.
Come on!
All right, everybody exit in an orderly...
All right, single file!
Keep it...
I seem to do a lot of falling and screaming in this adventure.
So there I was, face to face with the biggest, meanest leopard on this side of the Serengeti.
And...
You roared so loud, his spots flew clean off.
Dad, I've heard this like a billion times.
Do you know the one where I made the laughing hyenas...
Cry?
Yep.
- The croc attack?
- Dad.
OK.
Think.
Yeah, you do that.
All right, Mr. Smart Guy, here's one I know you haven't heard.
It all started in the little place I like to call the wild.
They were the fastest wildebeests on the savannah.
We're talking fast.
All the other lions had given up the hunt hours ago, except your old man.
Fortunately, I knew a short cut.
I thought I had 'em.
Until the dust cleared.
Classic wildebeest trap.
So, what did you do next?
- What did I do?
- Yeah.
That's when I gave them the roar.
- That's it?
- Hold on a sec.
I only thought it was over.
But they had a secret weapon.
He was the biggest wildebeest I've ever seen.
- He was 14 feet tall!
- Fourteen?
I meant 1,401 feet tall!
Cool.
And he had two...
No, four of the biggest horns I'd ever seen.
- Whoa!
- His breath was red hot!
I mean, green.
And he hated the environment.
To pull this off, I knew I was gonna have to dig deep, deeper than I ever had before.
So I swallowed my fear, sucked in the biggest breath I could.
Dad, I'm ready!
- You got it?
- I got it!
- I got it!
- Well, let him have it!
Roar, son!
Story of my life.
Your roar stops a herd of wildebeests.
Mine makes the babies laugh.
Hey, come on.
That was much better.
I'm serious!
It dropped half an octave.
It dropped half an octave.
And it sure scared me.
- Made my hair stand up on end.
- Yeah, right, Dad.
- OK.
Let's take it from the top.
- I'm done for today.
Come on, come on, one more.
You were so close.
Maybe it's something technical.
Maybe you're not opening your mouth wide enough.
Like this.
Dad, thanks for the technical help, but if you wanted me to roar like you, you'd take me to the wild.
Hold on a second.
We've got everything we could ever want here.
Great lifestyle, three squares a day.
- It's boring.
- Boring?
- I'll never learn how to roar here.
- Ryan.
But don't worry.
I finally figured out
- how we can get to the wild.
- You did?
The pigeons say those green boxes go there.
Those boxes are bad news.
Stay away.
- But, Dad...
- I know you're frustrated,
- but a lion finds his roar...
- Here.
I'm so tired of hearing that, Dad!
It's a rat!
Get that rat off my baby!
A rat?
Hello!
Silly, silly rat.
- Rats do not got bling like this, lady.
- You little...!
Lastly, that is the ugliest baby I've ever seen!
Benny, stealing candy from a baby?
Stealing is such a strong word.
I prefer "liberating."
Hey, kid, heard the roar.
Down another...
- Octave.
- Octave!
You ready to cheer me and your old man as we capture our fifth straight turtle-curling title?
I can't even roar.
How would you even know I'm there?
So, you really think it dropped an octave?
Absolutely.
- What the heck is an octave?
- I heard that.
- Rabbit.
- Cholesterol.
I'll stick with the nuts.
I don't know what his problem is, Benny.
He's 11, but he's still roaring at a nine-year-old level.
Little help here, Sammy?
You know what?
Maybe you're setting the bar too high, with all those stories about Samson the Wild.
Hey, he's always loved those stories!
They inspire him.
OK.
I'm not gonna argue with someone who can use my tail as dental floss.
- You got something right there.
- Where?
- No, no, other side.
- Here?
- Sorry, Benny.
- You got it.
Attention, friends.
Stop by the gift shop and get the most popular plush in America:
Nigel, the "I-Like-You" Koala.
- Look, honey!
The crazy thing talks!
- I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
That's right.
He's so cuddly.
And better yet, he likes you.
Finally.
And the zoo will officially be ours in T-minus three two and showtime!
Here I come!
Who put that bar there?
That tickles!
- Did too!
- Did not!
- Did too!
- Did not!
Out of my way, ya bum!
There's that moth-eaten koala!
I've told you flamingos a hundred times, walk.
- How about an autograph?
!
- Don't...
Birds!
Find the string on his back!
- So you're havin' a really nice day!
- Guys.
Off my co-captain, now.
Sorry, Samson.
That didn't hurt.
I almost forgot to tell you.
I'm gonna ask Bridget out finally.
Slow down, Romeo.
You are a squirrel and she is...
Perfect, right?
Look, I know what you're sayin'.
Believe me, I got my eyes wide open.
Watch where you're goin', you big...!
Bridget.
Don't stare at my spots, Benny.
My eyes are up here.
Of course.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, this is for you, honey.
It goes around your left hoof.
Did you get that out of the trash?
You did!
You trash-picker!
I'm not a trash-picker.
I'm a recycler.
That's a lot more romantic.
Isn't it?
- Romantic?
- Sam, come here.
Romantic?
Don't mention romance to me, Benny.
- I've never had a boyfriend.
- That settles it.
I accept the job...
of boyfriend number one.
Benny, only the female orb-weaver spider will date a male one-twentieth her size.
- So there's hope!
- And then she eats him.
But at least he dies happy.
Let's get Ryan, dude!
Dude!
We said that at the same time!
Dude.
Hey!
Hey, Ryan.
Listen, I'm headin' down to the game.
I'm gonna see you there, right?
Come on, Ryan.
We need you.
You're our biggest fan.
Yo, Samson!
I'm your number one fan, man!
Thanks, man.
Right back at ya!
You were saying, Dad?
Listen.
About this afternoon, I was just trying...
Dad, fine.
I'll go to your game, all right?
OK.
I'll... see you there, then.
Come on, dude.
- Dude.
- Guess who's here?
Eze.
Duke.
Man, he always guesses.
We're gonna stalk the gazelles while everybody's at the game.
- You in?
- Let's go, bro!
The Ryanator.
I'm comin' down.
Fish heads!
Get your ice-cold fish heads!
Now eyeball-free!
We're into the final period of the curling championships and the penguins are up.
Here comes Victor.
What a beauty!
Yeah, sweep!
Heading straight for the bull's-eye!
This could be it, folks!
- Bo-wango!
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah!
- That's gonna be tough to beat.
What? "Tough to beat"?
That's just the way we like it, right, guys?
I can't believe this!
If we lose, I'm gonna rip my head off!
And yours!
We cannot lose to flightless birds!
Whoa, whoa.
No one is losing anything around here.
As long as we stay focused.
- By the way, has anyone seen Ryan?
- Oh!
I know!
Maybe he's sulking 'cause he lives in his father's shadow and he roars like a schoolgirl.
- Thanks, Lar.
- You betcha!
Nigel!
Nigel!
Will you sign my dolly?
- Not again.
- Nigel, ignore them.
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
- You're so cuddly!
We love you!
- That's it!
I am not cuddly!
I'm a vicious jungle animal from the streets of London!
- Fear me!
- Get him!
Get him!
Get him!
- Help me!
- Girls!
Put him down.
I am not a doll!
- Cushy tushy!
- Leave my bum alone!
Nigel!
Get your paws off my girlfriend!
Benny, I am not your girlfriend!
Really nice day!
What is up with Samson's team tonight?
Brutal!
Benny?
Oh, my gosh!
Who knows mouth-to-mouth?
I do!
What was that?
Just your daily dose of vitamin Benny, baby.
- Get off my nose.
- I'm so cuddly, I like you!
- Stop saying that!
- G'day, mate!
Cannonball!
Next year, I should just coach.
Check it.
The Thomson gazelle.
Zero to 50 in four-point-five seconds.
- The ultimate fleeing machine.
- There is no substitute.
Let's get a closer look at these slim jims.
- Shall we?
- I think we shall.
Maybe we should just go to the game.
- I thought you wanted to be wild.
- Your dad chased gazelles.
Yeah, if he were our age, he would so be rockin' out with us.
He'd be in there, runnin' 'em down like they were...
- Gazelles.
- Yeah, gazelles or somethin'.
Ready, man?
We'd better not.
Oh, yeah?
Are you gonna stop us?
- Guys, guys.
- Here we go!
The whole series comes down to this throw!
There's no tomorrow!
It's do or die!
Ya know what I mean.
Guys, I know we're down, but we're gonna pull this out 'cause we're gonna use...
-...the secret play.
- The secret play!
Hey, everybody, guess what?
We're gonna use the secret play!
Larry, the first part of the secret play is keeping it secret.
- OK.
- Follow my lead.
I'm going to need a double effort from everybody.
Absolutely, captain.
Triple effort if you want, sir.
- Good.
Ready, and...
- Break!
Quiet.
On three, dude.
One, two...
No!
Now you did it, Ryan.
Feelin' mean, Donald?
Bring it on!
Folks, there's pressure on the big guy!
- Ready, Bridget?
- Ready.
- Ready, Benny?
- Ready!
Samson, it's a shame your little brat isn't here to see you lose.
I can't... hold it!
Oh, no!
What are you doin'?
And here comes Samson.
Look at that guy.
Is he a beauty or what?
Larry!
Bridget!
Sweep!
What a recovery!
He's sendin' in Bridget and Larry to do the job!
Sweep faster, Larry!
Sweep, sweep!
- I am!
- Come on, man!
Team Penguin is sending their ace, Victor...
- Watch it, Victor!
- Watch it yourself, see?
Nigel, how are we looking?
- This could be trouble, folks!
- Sweep, sweep, sweep.
This is cheating and you will die for this.
I can't hear you, Nigel.
Move left a bit...
OK.
Move left and hit!
- Larry, no!
- Tallyho!
What a move!
Folks, we are inches away from the greatest upset in turtle-curling history!
- Oh, no!
I can't believe my eyes!
- No!
Looks like Samson might have choked!
- Nice!
- Yes!
Unbelievable!
Samson and his team have clinched the title!
- No, wait!
I've called it too soon!
- What the heck?
The penguins have done it!
They're zoo champs for the first time!
Stampede?
Stampede!
Please!
Stop!
Watch out!
Dude.
Busted.
Catastrophic.
Told you I'd come to the game.
You think this is funny?
You just endangered everyone in the zoo!
- I'm sorry.
- For what?
Chasing the gazelles or costing us the game?
All you do is sit up in your tree and sulk.
- If you just...
- What's the problem?
Is all this because you can't roar?
Ryan, I didn't mean that.
Know what I'm doing when I'm sulking in my tree?
I'm thinking how great it would be if Samson the Wild wasn't my father.
Ryan, I didn't...
'Cause it would make being Ryan the Lame a lot easier.
Ryan, I'm sorry.
Ryan!
Please don't leave.
Bye, Ryan!
Thanks for coming to the game.
And you were worried he wouldn't show up.
Not good.
No one listens to the squirrel.
I don't know what to do anymore, Benny.
- I've tried everything.
- Everything?
- You tried everything?
- What are you saying?
I'm saying you have to tell him the truth.
I don't think I could do that, Benny.
I mean...
What's he gonna think of me when he finds out?
I don't know.
But if you don't tell him you're gonna lose him, Sammy.
The green boxes.
OK, they're all loaded up!
- You don't think I know that?
- Get movin'!
I changed my mind!
I don't wanna go!
Help!
Ryan.
Help me!
Watch out!
Sam!
- Wait for us!
- Dad!
- Ryan!
- Dad!
Don't let them take me!
- No!
- Ryan!
Help!
- No!
- Dad!
Help me!
Ryan!
- Benny, we need that truck followed.
- Check.
Get me... the pigeons.
I am wanting snake eyes!
Come on, baby.
Come on, just throw it.
Thanks.
Hamir!
You are the great loser of all time!
What offerings must I make, I wonder?
Hamir!
Hamir!
Get a grip on yourself!
Benny!
I am needing till Friday before I am paying you back!
No, no.
It's Ryan.
He's in one of those green boxes and they took it away!
We've got to find him!
That is not good!
Not good at all!
I know!
I know!
I am telling him, you crazy pigeon!
The green boxes go to the big water where stiff lady with spikes on her head...
- Hamir?
I can't understand...
- Spikes!
Just tell me where the green boxes go.
Stiff lady, spikies?
Yes, like my wife says, the truck takes them to her!
To her!
Though I hate telling bad news, there is more bad news to tell.
When the sun rises, the green boxes leave on boat-boat and never return!
I am sorry for this.
I really am.
Hello?
No.
Not good.
Not good.
You always say that.
I keep on sayin' it.
No one's listenin'.
Like a broken record here.
OK.
When do we leave, Sammy?
Yeah, when do we leave?
It's not "we." It's me.
Let's make this clear.
This is now a rescue mission and I am the only one going.
We'll come too!
We're not afraid.
Are we, guys?
Afraid?
No.
You know koalas.
More like "scared of things."
Ryan's like a cub to all of us.
Not that I'll ever have one of my own at this rate.
You know, there's that famous...
A koala once said,
"We will fight them... with peaches."
Yeah.
Anyway.
- So we're helping, whatever it takes.
- You want to leave with me?
OK.
If you don't mind being hunted down, shot at...
-...stuffed...
- OK!
...or worse, then fine.
I have a recurring nightmare about taxidermy and spot remover.
Well, they have to catch us before they can stuff us and I'm fast.
Nobody's leaving but me.
Got it?
- You're the boss.
- You bet.
- You got the big hair.
- Absolutely.
Yeah, that's good, Sammy.
Hey, way to weed out the weak links.
Now that they're out of the picture, what's the plan?
Don't worry about a thing, big guy.
I got it all taken care of.
I know this city like the back of my paw.
We ditch this truck at Fifth Avenue, couple lefts, couple rights, bada-boom, past Broadway and...
You're there!
What are you doing here?
- What?
- We're going to help you find Ryan!
She said, "We're gonna help you find Ryan."
- Oh, great.
- Hey, guys.
I've got popcorn up my bum.
Do I look trashy in this?
OK, here's my...
Here's my overall plan.
Where are we going?
I only have until sunrise before Ryan is taken away forever!
And now I have to worry about you three?
All right, fine.
When do we get off of this thing, Benny?
Benny's here?
Yeah, he's right there.
Benny?
Benny!
Great.
Now what am I gonna do?
Guys!
Guys!
I think we should duck!
What is she saying?
She said, "Duck down!"
Duck!
I am not in the mood for a game of footsie or hoofsie or pawsie or...
That wasn't my paw.
It was this!
I didn't steal it.
I borrowed it.
It'll light the way to Ryan.
The walls are moving.
Right, right.
The walls...
The walls are moving!
Larry, hold your breath!
Larry, stay straight!
Everybody out!
All right, don't panic.
What we've got to do...
This is definitely not good.
Samson!
- Give me your hoof!
- Help!
Larry!
The garbage!
It lives!
Guys?
OK, anybody?
I'm freakin' out.
- What's the hold up?
- Hello?
We're over here, Nigel.
Right.
I'll be there in a minute.
Think.
What did Benny say?
Couple of lefts, couple of rights.
Bridget, can you see the green lady?
I'm looking, I'm looking, but I can't see over anything for a change.
How far are you away?
You in a different continent?
Is that you, Larry?
Up here, Nige.
You're a very furry snake.
Guys...
We don't want to draw attention to ourselves.
Dogs.
This should be fun for you, Samson.
Nigel!
Grab Bridget!
- What?
- Run!
I'm gonna throw up!
I'm gonna throw up!
Shouldn't you be tearing them to shreds?
All part of the plan.
This maneuver's known as the Serengeti Slip.
Page ten of the Predator's Playbook.
What next?
Page 11?
Go on, you mutts!
Stupid dogs, we could've taken you.
Taken you to a...
To a disco!
Larry, improvise!
- Larry, that's not helping.
- OK.
You dogs think you got bark?
Well, Samson's got roar!
- Show 'em, Sam.
- Dig deep, Samson.
You're a lion.
Be a lion.
Look at that guy!
Sam, they are frothing at the mouth.
OK...
- Larry, coil!
- Check!
- Sam!
- I improvised.
Now jump!
- Down there?
- Yes!
We're leaving, Larry!
Teensy question, Samson.
With those dogs up there, why didn't you just do what you did in the wild?
You know, lionize 'em or lionate them or lionify them?
I don't have time to fight dogs, Bridget.
We have to find Ryan, remember?
What is this stinky place?
It appears to be a human bathing area.
You mean humans don't lick themselves clean?
Disgusting!
They're hopeless.
It is hard to believe they are at the top of the food chain.
I can't imagine beginning the day without licking myself.
No hurry, but is there a plan?
Of course there's a plan.
We follow this water to the big water, and then we find the lady with...
Larry, either your stomach is growling or something in it is growling.
Wasn't me.
What?
- Smooth move, Nigel!
- Oh, boy!
Twins!
OK, Sammy, hurry it up now, 'cause these guys are seeming to have acid reflux or something!
Everybody... stay calm.
- Calm?
- Not good.
Yo.
Boo!
I'm gonna say, it looks like you and your crew here are a little far from your borough.
Far from your borough!
I love it.
We're going to the big water.
Nigel, show them what we're looking for.
- Like this?
- I think it's in her right hand.
- And isn't she blue?
- I can't do blue.
- No idea.
You?
- Doesn't even register.
- You're batting' zero, kid.
- Do the thing with...
Make your bloody mind up.
The big female with the spikes on her melon!
They're tourists.
All right, tourists, listen up.
Ya gotta get to Battery Park.
First take the Broadway culvert.
- Down the Broadway culvert?
- What's wrong with that?
- They get lost at the sewage plant!
- Get outta here!
- What are you talking about?
- How would you send 'em?
You're sendin' 'em the wrong way!
The Wall Street culvert is blocked with construction.
- That is true.
- All right.
Guys, you gonna help or not?
Yeah, sure.
Of course we're gonna help ya's.
We're one big family, right?
Except for that guy there.
He scares the...
You done runnin' your mouth yet, Carmine?
Are ya?
I apologize.
He never got over being flushed down the toilet.
Yeah.
Follow me, 'cause you four won't last ten minutes in this neighborhood.
It's a jungle down here.
- Stan, you know who that is?
- What?
No.
That's one of them talkin' kawana bears!
How ya doing?
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I've seen a lot of those things floating' here in the sewer.
That's good!
You're makin' me laugh over here.
Just wait for me!
Are we in the right place?
Any place without two hilarious alligators seems a move in the right direction.
- Sam, do you see anything up there?
- I sure do.
Well, well, well.
There she is, like Hamir said.
And it's sunrise, which means we're a tad short on time.
Guys, look.
We know the box Ryan's in is green.
It's gotta be around here, so I need you to...
Yeah.
So we should shout out if we see a box that looks like the ones over there.
It hasn't left yet!
We can make it!
- Let's go!
- Hold on, Larry!
- Which way now?
- Yeah, which way?
Run!
No!
No!
Ryan's on that thing!
We've got to stop it!
- We can't, Sam!
- I don't care!
- No, Sammy, you'll drown!
- Sam!
I failed.
Again.
I only count one failure.
It's big, but it's just one.
Goodbye, Ryan.
We're gonna miss ya.
- Samson!
- What on earth is going on?
It's a human and I do not think he works for the zoo.
Perhaps now is a good time to improvise.
What?
Great!
One problem down...
Far out.
Cool.
One disaster to go.
What are you doing?
We're headed for the other boat!
How do we steer?
Who knows how to steer?
None of us.
We're animals.
Great!
- Hold on, Larry.
Do that again.
- Do what?
Whatever you just did, but the opposite!
But I don't know my opposites!
No, Larry, like this!
I think I've got it.
Well, that was easy.
Oh, dear.
Has anyone got any eucalyptus wipes?
This isn't so difficult.
I'm the lion of the sea!
Well done, sir.
Captain of our team and now captain of this vessel.
You're brilliant.
I hate to be Miss Negative, but in this melee, we seem to have lost Ryan's boat.
- What, nothing?
- Nothing.
He's gone.
No.
There!
Nelson!
The green boxes!
- You're sure, eh?
- And there's my buddies!
And my love!
Let's go in!
- We'll head away from the sun.
- No, towards the sun.
To the north.
Starboard...
Leftboard.
Just follow my finger.
Please.
You guys wouldn't know the answer if it fell from the sky and hit you in the head.
Oh, my!
It's a bat!
It's a bat!
Get it off me!
Get it off me!
- Benny!
- Benny?
Geese!
- Are you all right?
- Yes, my princess.
Benny, you made it!
You're my best friend.
Best friends should stick together.
Even not-so-best friends, who knock you off a speeding garbage truck.
Excuse me, but I begged them to go back and get you.
Just so you know.
Benny, could you see Ryan's boat from up there?
Well, it just so happens I saw it heading that way.
And we're in luck!
- How's it goin', eh?
- Canadian geese!
Experts at intercontinental travel.
Hey, birdie, OK, is it true that Canada has lax immigration policies for koalas?
I'll take it from here.
My son's out there.
We really need your help.
Can you lead us to that boat?
No problem, eh?
Just follow us and Bob's your uncle.
Try not to lag too far behind, eh?
Hey, Benny, thanks.
And fyi, Bridget was very concerned when you fell off the truck.
Bet you didn't know I could ride geese, did you?
- Bareback.
- Oh, brother.
Sammy?
We going to the wild now?
I think we are, Larry.
I can't take it anymore.
He's taunting us!
Listen!
Stop laughing at us, you solar twit!
Captain Bligh, sir!
Are the ice cream cones ready?
The crew, they're on the verge of mutiny.
Nigel, please.
If you don't give us ice creams pretty quick, you're gonna walk the plank, sir!
- Nigel.
- I don't care if I drown,
I'm getting off this death cruise right now.
Iceberg!
Permission to go down with the ship, sir.
Hang on!
Stuff that!
Run!
Swim!
Nigel?
Look, I'm a starfish.
Guys, look.
Gosh.
Must feel like a lifetime since you've been here.
Yeah... a lifetime.
What the heck?
Wow!
Look!
They're releasing the green boxes back into the wild.
- Larry.
- Guys, they're putting animals inside the green boxes.
I just can't figure out why.
It's a tunnel to another dimension, can't you see?
- They go in...
- Who is this guy?
It's all right, Nigel.
Think it has anything to do with that?
Hang on a second.
Either I'm starving or Larry is making sense.
You're right.
Those animals are being rescued.
Ryan?
Ryan!
Oh, no!
Ryan!
We've got to move fast!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Where are you, buddy?
Ryan!
- I can't believe it!
- Samson!
I was so close.
He was right there!
- We'll never find him now!
- Come here!
Will you get a hold of yourself?
Use your instincts.
I don't want to run anymore.
Good. 'Cause frankly, you need a good sports bra.
- Ryan?
- Everything's under control.
- Temporary setback.
- I got it.
- I got Ryan's scent!
- He got it?
I mean, he got it!
Let's go!
- Hooray!
- Wait for us!
I'm not designed for this!
I want a car.
Hey, guys, I found him!
Ryan!
Doesn't anyone knock anymore?
Where's my son?
Did he come through here?
Yeah, now that I think about it, he did come through here.
Hello?
Come on out, baby lion!
Your dad's here!
Well, what do you know?
There's a whole pride of lions here!
Funky.
I was under the impression you had Ryan's scent, not this olfactory insult.
I...
I had Ryan's scent, but my predator instincts must've kicked in since, you know, I haven't eaten for a while.
Exactly!
You never know when those instincts are gonna kick in.
Excellent.
Fantastic!
We get to see the legend in action.
I'd love to, but we just don't have time.
We got the time, Sammy.
Just...
And then you do this.
And then this bit.
Rip him apart!
The horror.
I can't bear to watch!
But I have to.
Go on.
Get out of here.
- The legend dropped his dinner.
- Oh, boy.
What's wrong?
I'm not good enough for you to eat?
No.
It's just I'm allergic to nuts.
Now I get it.
You're gonna toy with me?
Beat me up a little, then pounce when I get my hopes up?
How exciting.
Come on, guys.
Ryan can't be far.
Hey!
I'm not finished with you!
I am a delicacy.
My flesh has fruity wood notes!
Watch it, you little hors d'oeuvre.
That's Samson the Wild.
You call this wild?
This is a cat!
A big, fat, tame pussycat!
- OK, that's enough!
- The pussycat hissed at me!
Maybe I should hide behind the koala for protection.
While we're at it, could you slap me in the face?
No.
What are you, a twit?
- Ignore him.
- Don't bother!
I'm leaving.
- You're weird.
- Run for your lives!
It's a lion with moral issues!
And I've had it with you too!
Thanks a lot for wrecking my day!
Teensy question.
Or more like a...
a sort of a query meets a statement.
That hyrax back there?
It was sort of like you couldn't eat him.
Yeah, and what about those dogs?
There was no munching there, either.
If I didn't know any better, I'd say that you're...
- A vegetarian?
- Nope.
- That's not what I was going to say.
- You were going to say...
- It's almost like...
- You're not from...
The wild?
Well, you're right.
I'm not from the wild.
What?
I'm just a phony.
Truth is I can't protect you out here.
Please just go back to the boat.
I've got to find my son.
Tell me we're not in a dangerous jungle with an 8-inch squirrel protecting us.
Actually, I'm nine inches, but other than that, yes.
So that means...
We are going to die!
Hey, guys!
Guys!
Will the three of you calm down?
How could he lie to us?
- We're his best friends.
- Sure.
Maybe he lied 'cause he didn't want to tell us the truth.
OK, yeah, whatever.
Whatever.
Let's just go back to the boat, then.
The fierce, the proud, the wild...
Rubbish!
But wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait!
Where you goin'?
Stop right there!
Stop!
Bridget, if you go, I'm...
I'm breaking up with you.
We were never going out in the first place.
Then we're taking a break.
- Nigel!
- All right!
Hey, listen!
I know you're scared.
But at least we got each other.
Sammy's got nobody.
He's out there all alone.
And... so is Ryan.
OK, OK, focus, Samson.
He's got to be out there somewhere.
You'll find him.
I mean, how big can this place be, anyway?
Ryan!
Hey there, little fella.
You're lost too, huh?
You remind me of my buddy back home.
A bloodthirsty monster!
Where?
Where?
He's a killer!
Get away from my baby!
Calm down, lady!
Won't anyone save my baby?
Bye-bye.
Ryan!
Ryan!
Sammy!
I wasn't meant for the wild.
I was made to nibble and be elegant and to appear in children's books as the letter G.
Come on, this isn't scary, is it?
It's just leaves and vines and...
Oh, that's my foot.
Nigel, keep a lookout back there.
- You too, Larry!
- Okeydokey.
Oh, I see.
All right, OK, yeah.
You're giving me the silent treatment.
Like I care.
Nigel!
I gave you an order.
Would a little "Sir, yes, sir!" kill ya?
Nigel.
That's not funny, Nigel.
- He's gone!
We're doomed.
- Nigel!
First Ryan, then Samson, and now Nigel!
I do believe in zoos.
- Larry, you're tensing up!
- I do, I do, I do.
- Don't panic.
I'm in charge.
- That's why we're panicking!
I say we fan out and circle.
What are we, peacocks?
We don't fan, we run.
Run for your lives, everybody!
Guys, I've got an idea.
Why don't we ask them?
It's OK...
They, you see, they got hooves.
That means they don't hunt.
They graze.
But they're licking their chops.
I'll take the one with the funny knees.
The funny knee...?
Benny, no!
Benny?
Get them.
Just, hey, back off.
I'm sorry,
I'm not that kind of koala bear.
Right.
Excuse me?
Hello?
Terribly sorry to bother you, but do you speak koala?
Sprechen Sie koala?
Right.
Could you possibly not go towards the big smoking thing?
G'day, mate G'day, mate
G'day, mate G'day, mate
G'day, mate G'day, mate
What a strange place for a party.
Very good, very organized.
Can I use your toilet?
I'm having a
Really nice day Really nice day
Really nice day
I'm having a
Really nice day Really nice day
Really nice day
- Why don't you all
- Tickle away, tickle away
They're frighteningly horrible monster beasts but they're not bad dancers.
I'm so cuddly I like you
I'm so cuddly I like you
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
- I'm having a
- Really nice day
Oh, no!
Tickle away Tickle away
I'm so cuddly, I like you Good day
- What is that?
- I am Kazar.
Leader.
Prophet.
Choreographer.
And with your help... carnivore!
No!
Don't kill me!
I've had such a weird life!
This is not fair.
Oh, I get it.
A yoga retreat.
Ryan!
You can do this.
Use your instincts.
Follow your instincts.
Use your instincts.
OK.
Down this way.
This way.
A lion cub.
We must tell Kazar.
- It's my turn to tell him.
- You got to last time.
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!
Thank you very much, but I'm afraid I've got to run.
Koalas are very busy bees.
If I could...
I'll just buzz along to the door...
For centuries, we've watched our brethren perish at the claw of the lion.
Today, we put our hooves down.
No longer will we dwell at the bottom of the food chain.
Well, yes.
I should say so.
There were those who doubted that you'd arrive to lead us.
But I always believed in the Omen.
The Omen!
Right.
Remind me again?
Sent down by the gods years ago...
Oh, no!
Not you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
Oh, Great Him, you must lead us in our transformation from prey to predator.
Hold it.
I am the Great Him?
- The Great Him?
- Him.
So this is all your fault!
That's it!
You...!
- Kazar!
- Kazar!
Don't listen to him!
- Kazar!
Over here!
- Kazar!
Over here!
How dare you interrupt my audience with the Great Him!
But... but we found a lion cub!
- You did?
- Was he with a big lion?
With big hair?
Well, a mullet, really.
Oh, Great Him, you brought two lions with you?
Well, like any Great Him,
I travel with an entourage.
Worry not, Your Himness, I shall have Blag bring the lions here.
And he better not screw this up, like you screwed up my dance number!
I lost count for one verse.
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
Why do we even bother rehearsing?
A good chorus line is so hard to put together.
Take to the skies!
We're taking!
We're taking!
- Find them!
- Yes, sir.
Bring us those lions!
The gods celebrate the fulfillment of the prophecy.
We stamp our hooves in praise of the Great Him!
Holy moly!
Holy moly Holy moly
You are our king!
Looky, looky who's there.
Surprise!
No!
Sorry we're late for dinner!
That's pathetic!
Get off!
- That didn't hurt!
- Stop!
- Ryan!
- No!
I'm coming, son!
Dad?
- Help!
- Let's scram!
- Ryan!
- What are you doing here?
- I can't believe it!
I found you.
- How'd you find me?
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
- Your paw.
- I got trapped in that box.
It's OK, son.
And then I escaped, and I ran into the jungle then those vultures came and tried to kill me.
You wouldn't have been scared.
I was.
- I have to tell you something.
- What?
Listen.
- Get 'em, Dad!
- Run!
Run!
Dad, you should be chasing them!
- Like you used to!
- Those were just stories!
But now's your chance to show me for real!
This way!
- Dad?
What's goin' on?
- Just get up into that tree!
- I think we lost them.
- What's the deal?
They're just a bunch of wimpy donkeys!
You could kick their rumps!
- Ryan, I can't fight them.
- You donkey-chickens!
Get back here!
Ryan!
I can't fight them.
What do you mean?
I was young still just a cub.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Children of all ages.
Samson!
Swallow that fear and stand tall!
Witness the greatest day in our young lion's life!
The day he discovers his roar!
Dad, I can't do it!
Now, go!
Listen as Samson unleashes a roar so mighty, it launches a wildebeest clear off the savannah!
Samson!
Dig deep!
I should have known.
If you'd been born in the wild, you'd know how to roar.
Dad?
Dad!
Dad!
Please!
Dad.
When they shipped me to the zoo, I never wanted anyone to know where I came from.
Especially those closest to me.
I should have told you sooner.
But... all those stories you tell?
I'm so sorry, Ryan.
Everything you told me was a lie?
- Dad!
- Hang on, son.
Help!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Run!
Not so fast, Tigger.
Dad!
Ryan!
Dad!
- Help!
- Ryan.
Help!
Dad!
- Ryan.
- Dad!
Help me!
What?
Wait!
What?
What?
Wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Get off me!
What is goin' on here?
- Stinky does not speak.
- It rolls like a little ball.
Wait.
You guys think I'm a...?
- Achtung, Stinky!
- Less talk, more roll.
- Ja.
- Roll!
Roll!
What the...?
Hey!
Rolling the dung is good for tight buns!
I'll give you something to roll about!
It's a good thing Bridget didn't see that!
Bridget?
Larry!
They're gone.
I gotta find them!
No!
I gotta find Samson first!
No!
First...
Sam.
Sam!
Bridget!
Larry!
Oh, Ryan!
You're alive!
Good to see you guys.
- Where's my hug?
- Larry.
- There it is.
- It's good to see you too.
What are you guys doing here?
We came here with your father to find you.
And he's probably out there right now lookin' for us.
I wish he were.
But some of these wildebeests pushed him off a cliff.
- What?
- What?
I don't think he made it.
I don't see how he could.
Oh, Ryan.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Kazar, I think you'll be very pleased with what I brought you.
What's this?
Where's the other lion?
Right.
Well, I was gonna tell you, there was this cliff and...
Why are you looking at me like that?
That's twice you've been out of step today, Blag!
You klutz.
You know we can't ascend to the top of the food chain until we eat a lion!
Well, at least there'll be enough for my ascension.
What about the rest of us?
Step-kick, pivot-kick!
Ouch!
I twisted a hoof!
You work and you work.
Then they break your heart.
- There goes my career!
- Prepare the sacrifices!
Why did I let him go off by himself?
He couldn't catch a cold, much less his own lunch.
Bet I could catch you.
Please.
My natural predator is fuel inject...
What?
I knew you weren't really gone.
I knew it!
Come on, I knew it!
We're still buddies, right?
I lost Ryan.
There were too many.
They just took him.
Who?
Who took him?
- Wildebeests.
- The freaks with the hooves!
They got Larry and Bridget too.
Couldn't fight, couldn't...
Come on, Sam.
You're a lion.
You come from a long line of kings.
Yeah, maybe you're not from the wild.
But fighting's in your blood!
No.
I'll never be a real lion.
Wrong!
You are a real lion.
Doesn't matter where you're from:
Zoo, jungle, goldfish bowl.
It's what's in here.
That determines who you are!
At least, that's what you always told your son.
Now he's out there, Sammy, and he needs you.
Who else is gonna teach him how to roar?
That's it, Sammy.
That's it.
Let's go find my son...
and my friends.
Yeah!
Nothing's gonna stop us!
Except that we have no idea where we're going!
Follow your instincts.
Follow your instincts.
- What is that?
- My... instincts?
- Benny?
- You're almost there.
That settles it, then.
My mother definitely drank pool water when she was pregnant with me.
Benny, look.
The freaks with hooves!
Ryan's in there.
You can't just barge in.
That's suicide!
- Benny, get out of my way!
- Don't listen to the rat.
- Hey, who are you calling a rat?
- You, of course.
- You'll give away our position.
- I'll have you written up for that!
Fool!
You blew our cover!
Men!
Scatter!
Not so fast!
Look who I got, Sammy.
It's your lion instincts.
Who are you guys?
- Our names aren't important.
- I'm Cloak.
He's Camo.
- We're covert agents.
- Why have you been leading me around?
- That's classified.
- Top-secret.
- The wildebeests have gone mad.
- Cloak.
It's not like I told them our plan is to use them to defeat Kazar's...
Listen, just tell me, did they take my son in there?
- That's need-to-know.
- They did.
- They think the koala's a god.
- You're the worst covert agent!
Oh, yeah?
Then why can I do this?
Men!
Hey!
No!
Stop!
Sammy!
- Idiot!
That maneuver's confidential.
- It's secret.
This one's confidential.
- Cloak!
- And this one's restricted.
Super-secret.
Top-secret.
This is ultra-secret!
Enough!
No more!
Show 'em the super-top-secret "no more?" Gotcha!
No!
I got an idea.
Who is this Great Him, anyway?
I'll take him on.
I'm the Great Her!
I'll show Him a thing or two.
I'm from New York City, for Pete's sake.
Oh, my.
You have got to be kidding me.
Nigel, I don't know what you're trying to pull,
- but I will kick your...
- Silence!
Why, you little...
Silence, again!
You do not speak to me!
Nigel, what's the deal?
Great Him, shall we prepare the feast?
Yes, we shall!
What's on the menu?
Them.
Oh, no.
Eat friends and be god, don't eat friends...
God, friends, god, friends.
God, I...
Well, that was subtle.
Prepare the meat fire!
Wait!
We cannot cook them without onion!
Onions.
Onions.
Onions.
Well, that was fast.
Let the ritual begin.
Move it!
I am so mad at you!
Wait!
We also need... hats!
Do we not have the party hats of death?
I've got mine!
And before the feast, we must all...
What the...?
...levitate and spin uncontrollably!
And feel a bit sick.
How do I stop this thing?
- Guys.
- Benny?
- Look, a squirrel!
- Larry!
We've got a plan.
Follow me.
- We?
- I can fly!
Oh, Great Him, we are humbled by your power.
Be humbled.
Only the Great Him can do this!
- Volcanic gas!
- Our cover's blown!
Major malfunction!
Abandon ship!
- Oh, boy.
- Well, about time you got here.
Great Him, it's another miracle!
You've delivered us a real lion!
Blag, your luck has turned.
Thanks to the Great Him, we shall all ascend tonight.
Nigel, we've got to create a distraction.
Hang on a sec!
I've got miracles comin' out my ears!
Ready?
Stand back as the Great Me attacks the lion over 73 times my size!
Dad?
My dad's alive!
Guys, my dad made it!
- Ryan, no!
- Hurry, I got to see him!
Whack, whack, whack!
- Dad!
- What?
Ryan!
- I planned this.
- Ryan, no!
At long last, the cosmic balance has shifted.
- Stay close.
- Prey has become predator!
And predator has become prey!
And the hoof finally trumps the claw!
Come on, Dad!
Let's show these turkey-jerkies who's at the top of the food chain!
Let's eat the brat first.
Over my dead body!
Yeah.
Dad!
He's gonna kill Samson if we don't do something!
Why don't we use the secret play?
I know.
Shut up, Larry.
That's stupid.
No!
It's brilliant!
They laughed at me when I spoke of the Omen.
But look who's laughing now!
Little to the left.
Yeah.
No!
Little to the right!
Next floor: bottom of the food chain!
Ding!
Fire!
We gotta find something bigger!
I know where we can find something bigger.
- Ready, Ryan?
- Dig deep!
You should have stayed at home.
Now our shrine will become your tomb.
Fire!
Ryan!
Ryan!
I don't typically eat dessert before the main course!
Get away from my son!
Ryan.
Ryan, are you still with me?
It's OK, Dad.
I just want you to know
I'm sorry you didn't have a father like the one I have.
Ryan.
How touching.
But then, last words usually are.
Finish them.
What are you doing?
I command you to attack them, like true predators!
We're tired of pretending to be something we're not.
But most of all, we're tired of you.
Blag.
Fine.
I'll kill them myself!
Dad, remember what you always told me in your stories:
Dig deep.
Oh, yeah, baby!
Let's go.
Yeah.
- Come on, let's get out of here!
- Get out of here!
And for the record, I've always hated your choreography.
It's so... '80s.
That's right!
Run!
Run like the cowardly prey that you are!
I will hunt you down!
Everyone!
To the boat!
Top of the food chain, Ma!
Top of the food chain...
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
Hurry!
We're never gonna make it!
Push, you crazy, hairy monsters!
Push!
- Larry, throw it in reverse!
- Reverse throwing!
At least I saw the wild before it disappeared.
I can still see it.
It's right...
Here.
I found my roar.
We both did, son.
You know, Dad, this'll be our first story of Samson and Ryan the Wild.
I don't think anybody's gonna believe it.
Incoming!
I'm so cuddly!
Cuddly!
I'm so cuddly!
I know you're cuddly.
But can you float?
- I'm having a
- Really nice day
Really nice day Really nice day
Step-kick left!
Really nice day
Step-kick right!
- Splendid.
- No!
Smashing.
Hey!
- Stupendous!
- Are you guys sure about this?
Operation Snake-Over is now complete.
Hey, look, everyone!
I'm a secret agent!
Bridget, I get it.
You're more than a tall, lanky goddess.
You're a strong, independent female.
You don't need to be defined by your relationship
- and I, I respect that.
- It's about time.
What was that?
Just your daily dose of vitamin Bridget, baby.
Oh, yeah yeah!
Really nice day Really nice day
Look out!
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
Yes!
Did y'all see that?
Check this!
Go, Blag!
Go, Blag!
Go, Blag!
Hey, Blag.
- No parking' on the dance floor.
- Parkin'?
Dad?
Make some room there, big guy!
Really nice day Really, really nice day
Yeah!
Pretty crazy, right?
Pretty wild!
Well, technically, it...
It's awesome.
Yes, right.
- I was just gonna say that.
- Come on!
Everyone!
This is gonna be a long ride home.
I'm havin' a
Really nice day Really nice day, really nice day
- I'm having a
- I'm so cuddly, I like you
G'day
What are you doing this for?
What, do you think it's funny?
Just get out.
Sorry about that, everybody.
Sorry.
Hello.
Do carry on.
Come on!
All right, everybody exit in an orderly...
All right, single file!
Keep it...
I seem to do a lot of falling and screaming in this adventure.
So there I was, face to face with the biggest, meanest leopard on this side of the Serengeti.
And...
You roared so loud, his spots flew clean off.
Dad, I've heard this like a billion times.
Do you know the one where I made the laughing hyenas...
Cry?
Yep.
- The croc attack?
- Dad.
OK.
Think.
Yeah, you do that.
All right, Mr. Smart Guy, here's one I know you haven't heard.
It all started in the little place I like to call the wild.
They were the fastest wilde beests on the savannah.
We're talking fast.
All the other lions had given up the hunt hours ago, except your old man.
Fortunately, I knew a short cut.
I thought I had 'em.
Until the dust cleared.
Classic wildebeest trap.
So, what did you do next?
- What did I do?
- Yeah.
That's when I gave them the roar.
- That's it?
- Hold on a sec.
I only thought it was over.
But they had a secret weapon.
He was the biggest wildebeest I've ever seen.
- He was 14 feet tall!
- Fourteen?
I meant 1,401 feet tall!
Cool.
And he had two...
No, four of the biggest horns I'd ever seen.
- Whoa!
- His breath was red hot!
I mean, green.
And he hated the environment.
To pull this off, I knew I was gonna have to dig deep, deeper than I ever had before.
So I swallowed my fear, sucked in the biggest breath I could.
Dad, I'm ready!
- You got it?
- I got it!
- I got it!
- Well, let him have it!
Roar, son!
Story of my life.
Your roar stops a herd of wildebeests.
Mine makes the babies laugh.
Hey, come on.
That was much better.
I'm serious!
It dropped half an octave.
It dropped half an octave.
And it sure scared me.
- Made my hair stand up on end.
- Yeah, right, Dad.
- OK.
Let's take it from the top.
- I'm done for today.
Come on, come on, one more.
You were so close.
Maybe it's something technical.
Maybe you're not opening your mouth wide enough.
Like this.
Dad, thanks for the technical help, but if you wanted me to roar like you, you'd take me to the wild.
Hold on a second.
We've got everything we could ever want here.
Great lifestyle, three squares a day.
- It's boring.
- Boring?
- I'll never learn how to roar here.
- Ryan.
But don't worry.
I finally figured out
- how we can get to the wild.
- You did?
The pigeons say those green boxes go there.
Those boxes are bad news.
Stay away.
- But, Dad...
- I know you're frustrated,
- but a lion finds his roar...
- Here.
I'm so tired of hearing that, Dad!
It's a rat!
Get that rat off my baby!
A rat?
Hello!
Silly, silly rat.
- Rats do not got bling like this, lady.
- You little...!
Lastly, that is the ugliest baby I've ever seen!
Benny, stealing candy from a baby?
Stealing is such a strong word.
I prefer "liberating."
Hey, kid, heard the roar.
Down another...
- Octave.
- Octave!
You ready to cheer me and your old man as we capture our fifth straight turtle-curling title?
I can't even roar.
How would you even know I'm there?
So, you really think it dropped an octave?
Absolutely.
- What the heck is an octave?
- I heard that.
- Rabbit.
- Cholesterol.
I'll stick with the nuts.
I don't know what his problem is, Benny.
He's 11, but he's still roaring at a nine-year-old level.
Little help here, Sammy?
You know what?
Maybe you're setting the bar too high, with all those stories about Samson the Wild.
Hey, he's always loved those stories!
They inspire him.
OK.
I'm not gonna argue with someone who can use my tail as dental floss.
- You got something right there.
- Where?
- No, no, other side.
- Here?
- Sorry, Benny.
- You got it.
Attention, friends.
Stop by the gift shop and get the most popular plush in America:
Nigel, the "l-Like-You" Koala.
- Look, honey!
The crazy thing talks!
- I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
That's right.
He's so cuddly.
And better yet, he likes you.
Finally.
And the zoo will officially be ours in T-minus three two and showtime!
Here I come!
Who put that bar there?
That tickles!
- Did too!
- Did not!
- Did too!
- Did not!
Out of my way, ya bum!
There's that moth-eaten koala!
I've told you flamingos a hundred times, walk.
- How about an autograph?
!
- Don't...
Birds!
Find the string on his back!
- So you're havin' a really nice day!
- Guys.
Off my co-captain, now.
Sorry, Samson.
That didn't hurt.
I almost forgot to tell you.
I'm gonna ask Bridget out finally.
Slow down, Romeo.
You are a squirrel and she is...
Perfect, right?
Look, I know what you're sayin'.
Believe me, I got my eyes wide open.
Watch where you're goin', you big...!
Bridget.
Don't stare at my spots, Benny.
My eyes are up here.
Of course.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, this is for you, honey.
It goes around your left hoof.
Did you get that out of the trash?
You did!
You trash-picker!
I'm not a trash-picker.
I'm a recycler.
That's a lot more romantic.
Isn't it?
- Romantic?
- Sam, come here.
Romantic?
Don't mention romance to me, Benny.
- I've never had a boyfriend.
- That settles it.
I accept the job...
of boyfriend number one.
Benny, only the female orb-weaver spider will date a male one-twentieth her size.
- So there's hope!
- And then she eats him.
But at least he dies happy.
Let's get Ryan, dude!
Dude!
We said that at the same time!
Dude.
Hey!
Hey, Ryan.
Listen, I'm headin' down to the game.
I'm gonna see you there, right?
Come on, Ryan.
We need you.
You're our biggest fan.
Yo, Samson!
I'm your number one fan, man!
Thanks, man.
Right back at ya!
You were saying, Dad?
Listen.
About this afternoon, I was just trying...
Dad, fine.
I'll go to your game, all right?
OK.
I'II... see you there, then.
Come on, dude.
- Dude.
- Guess who's here?
Eze.
Duke.
Man, he always guesses.
We're gonna stalk the gazelles while everybody's at the game.
- You in?
- Let's go, bro!
The Ryanator.
I'm comin' down.
Fish heads!
Get your ice-cold fish heads!
Now eyeball-free!
We're into the final period of the curling championships and the penguins are up.
Here comes Victor.
What a beauty!
Yeah, sweep!
Heading straight for the bull's-eye!
This could be it, folks!
- Bo-wango!
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah!
- That's gonna be tough to beat.
What? "Tough to beat"?
That's just the way we like it, right, guys?
I can't believe this!
If we lose, I'm gonna rip my head off!
And yours!
We cannot lose to flightless birds!
Whoa, whoa.
No one is losing anything around here.
As long as we stay focused.
- By the way, has anyone seen Ryan?
- Oh!
I know!
Maybe he's sulking 'cause he lives in his father's shadow and he roars like a schoolgirl.
- Thanks, Lar.
- You betcha!
Nigel!
Nigel!
Will you sign my dolly?
- Not again.
- Nigel, ignore them.
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
- You're so cuddly!
We love you!
- That's it!
I am not cuddly!
I'm a vicious jungle animal from the streets of London!
- Fear me!
- Get him!
Get him!
Get him!
- Help me!
- Girls!
Put him down.
I am not a doll!
- Cushy tushy!
- Leave my bum alone!
Nigel!
Get your paws off my girlfriend!
Benny, I am not your girlfriend!
Really nice day!
What is up with Samson's team tonight?
Brutal!
Benny?
Oh, my gosh!
Who knows mouth-to-mouth?
I do!
What was that?
Just your daily dose of vitamin Benny, baby.
- Get off my nose.
- I'm so cuddly, I like you!
- Stop saying that!
- G'day, mate!
Cannonball!
Next year, I should just coach.
Check it.
The Thomson gazelle.
Zero to 50 in four-point-five seconds.
- The ultimate fleeing machine.
- There is no substitute.
Let's get a closer look at these slim jims.
- Shall we?
- I think we shall.
Maybe we should just go to the game.
- I thought you wanted to be wild.
- Your dad chased gazelles.
Yeah, if he were our age, he would so be rockin' out with us.
He'd be in there, runnin' 'em down like they were...
- Gazelles.
- Yeah, gazelles or somethin'.
Ready, man?
We'd better not.
Oh, yeah?
Are you gonna stop us?
- Guys, guys.
- Here we go!
The whole series comes down to this throw!
There's no tomorrow!
It's do or die!
Ya know what I mean.
Guys, I know we're down, but we're gonna pull this out 'cause we're gonna use the secret play.
- The secret play!
Hey, everybody, guess what?
We're gonna use the secret play!
Larry, the first part of the secret play is keeping it secret.
- OK.
- Follow my lead.
I'm going to need a double effort from everybody.
Absolutely, captain.
Triple effort if you want, sir.
- Good.
Ready, and...
- Break!
Quiet.
On three, dude.
One, two...
No!
Now you did it, Ryan.
Feelin' mean, Donald?
Bring it on!
Folks, there's pressure on the big guy!
- Ready, Bridget?
- Ready.
- Ready, Benny?
- Ready!
Samson, it's a shame your little brat isn't here to see you lose.
I can't... hold it!
Oh, no!
What are you doin'?
And here comes Samson.
Look at that guy.
Is he a beauty or what?
Larry!
Bridget!
Sweep!
What a recovery!
He's sendin' in Bridget and Larry to do the job!
Sweep faster, Larry!
Sweep, sweep!
- I am!
- Come on, man!
Team Penguin is sending their ace, Victor...
- Watch it, Victor!
- Watch it yourself, see?
Nigel, how are we looking?
- This could be trouble, folks!
- Sweep, sweep, sweep.
This is cheating and you will die for this.
I can't hear you, Nigel.
Move left a bit...
OK.
Move left and hit!
- Larry, no!
- Tallyho!
What a move!
Folks, we are inches away from the greatest upset in turtle-curling history!
- Oh, no!
I can't believe my eyes!
- No!
Looks like Samson might have choked!
- Nice!
- Yes!
Unbelievable!
Samson and his team have clinched the title!
- No, wait!
I've called it too soon!
- What the heck?
The penguins have done it!
They're zoo champs for the first time!
Stampede?
Stampede!
Please!
Stop!
Watch out!
Dude.
Busted.
Catastrophic.
Told you I'd come to the game.
You think this is funny?
You just endangered everyone in the zoo!
- I'm sorry.
- For what?
Chasing the gazelles or costing us the game?
All you do is sit up in your tree and sulk.
- If you just...
- What's the problem?
Is all this because you can't roar?
Ryan, I didn't mean that.
Know what I'm doing when I'm sulking in my tree?
I'm thinking how great it would be if Samson the Wild wasn't my father.
Ryan, I didn't...
'Cause it would make being Ryan the Lame a lot easier.
Ryan, I'm sorry.
Ryan!
Please don't leave.
Bye, Ryan!
Thanks for coming to the game.
And you were worried he wouldn't show up.
Not good.
No one listens to the squirrel.
I don't know what to do anymore, Benny.
- I've tried everything.
- Everything?
- You tried everything?
- What are you saying?
I'm saying you have to tell him the truth.
I don't think I could do that, Benny.
I mean...
What's he gonna think of me when he finds out?
I don't know.
But if you don't tell him you're gonna lose him, Sammy.
The green boxes.
OK, they're all loaded up!
- You don't think I know that?
- Get movin'!
I changed my mind!
I don't wanna go!
Help!
Ryan.
Help me!
Watch out!
Sam!
- Wait for us!
- Dad!
- Ryan!
- Dad!
Don't let them take me!
- No!
- Ryan!
Help!
- No!
- Dad!
Help me!
Ryan!
- Benny, we need that truck followed.
- Check.
Get me... the pigeons.
I am wanting snake eyes!
Come on, baby.
Come on, just throw it.
Thanks.
Hamir!
You are the great loser of all time!
What offerings must I make, I wonder?
Hamir!
Hamir!
Get a grip on yourself!
Benny!
I am needing till Friday before I am paying you back!
No, no.
It's Ryan.
He's in one of those green boxes and they took it away!
We've got to find him!
That is not good!
Not good at all!
I know!
I know!
I am telling him, you crazy pigeon!
The green boxes go to the big water where stiff lady with spikes on her head...
- Hamir?
I can't understand...
- Spikes!
Just tell me where the green boxes go.
Stiff lady, spikies?
Yes, like my wife says, the truck takes them to her!
To her!
Though I hate telling bad news, there is more bad news to tell.
When the sun rises, the green boxes leave on boat-boat and never return!
I am sorry for this.
I really am.
Hello?
No.
Not good.
Not good.
You always say that.
I keep on sayin' it.
No one's listenin'.
Like a broken record here.
OK.
When do we leave, Sammy?
Yeah, when do we leave?
It's not "we." It's me.
Let's make this clear.
This is now a rescue mission and I am the only one going.
We'll come too!
We're not afraid.
Are we, guys?
Afraid?
No.
You know koalas.
More like "scared of things."
Ryan's like a cub to all of us.
Not that I'll ever have one of my own at this rate.
You know, there's that famous...
A koala once said,
"We will fight them... with peaches."
Yeah.
Anyway.
- So we're helping, whatever it takes.
- You want to leave with me?
OK.
If you don't mind being hunted down, shot at stuffed...
- OK!
...or worse, then fine.
I have a recurring nightmare about taxidermy and spot remover.
Well, they have to catch us before they can stuff us and I'm fast.
Nobody's leaving but me.
Got it?
- You're the boss.
- You bet.
- You got the big hair.
- Absolutely.
Yeah, that's good, Sammy.
Hey, way to weed out the weak links.
Now that they're out of the picture, what's the plan?
Don't worry about a thing, big guy.
I got it all taken care of.
I know this city like the back of my paw.
We ditch this truck at Fifth Avenue, couple lefts, couple rights, bada-boom, past Broadway and...
You're there!
What are you doing here?
- What?
- We're going to help you find Ryan!
She said, "We're gonna help you find Ryan."
- Oh, great.
- Hey, guys.
I've got popcorn up my bum.
Do I look trashy in this?
OK, here's my...
Here's my overall plan.
Where are we going?
I only have until sunrise before Ryan is taken away forever!
And now I have to worry about you three?
All right, fine.
When do we get off of this thing, Benny?
Benny's here?
Yeah, he's right there.
Benny?
Benny!
Great.
Now what am I gonna do?
Guys!
Guys!
I think we should duck!
What is she saying?
She said, "Duck down!"
Duck!
I am not in the mood for a game of footsie or hoofsie or pawsie or...
That wasn't my paw.
It was this!
I didn't steal it.
I borrowed it.
It'll light the way to Ryan.
The walls are moving.
Right, right.
The walls...
The walls are moving!
Larry, hold your breath!
Larry, stay straight!
Everybody out!
All right, don't panic.
What we've got to do...
This is definitely not good.
Samson!
- Give me your hoof!
- Help!
Larry!
The garbage!
It lives!
Guys?
OK, anybody?
I'm freakin' out.
- What's the hold up?
- Hello?
We're over here, Nigel.
Right.
I'll be there in a minute.
Think.
What did Benny say?
Couple of lefts, couple of rights.
Bridget, can you see the green lady?
I'm looking, I'm looking, but I can't see over anything for a change.
How far are you away?
You in a different continent?
Is that you, Larry?
Up here, Nige.
You're a very furry snake.
Guys...
We don't want to draw attention to ourselves.
Dogs.
This should be fun for you, Samson.
Nigel!
Grab Bridget!
- What?
- Run!
I'm gonna throw up!
I'm gonna throw up!
Shouldn't you be tearing them to shreds?
All part of the plan.
This maneuver's known as the Serengeti Slip.
Page ten of the Predator's Playbook.
What next?
Page 11?
Go on, you mutts!
Stupid dogs, we could've taken you.
Taken you to a...
To a disco!
Larry, improvise!
- Larry, that's not helping.
- OK.
You dogs think you got bark?
Well, Samson's got roar!
- Show 'em, Sam.
- Dig deep, Samson.
You're a lion.
Be a lion.
Look at that guy!
Sam, they are frothing at the mouth.
OK...
- Larry, coil!
- Check!
- Sam!
- I improvised.
Now jump!
- Down there?
- Yes!
We're leaving, Larry!
Teensy question, Samson.
With those dogs up there, why didn't you just do what you did in the wild?
You know, lionize 'em or lionate them or lionify them?
I don't have time to fight dogs, Bridget.
We have to find Ryan, remember?
What is this stinky place?
It appears to be a human bathing area.
You mean humans don't lick themselves clean?
Disgusting!
They're hopeless.
It is hard to believe they are at the top of the food chain.
I can't imagine beginning the day without licking myself.
No hurry, but is there a plan?
Of course there's a plan.
We follow this water to the big water, and then we find the lady with...
Larry, either your stomach is growling or something in it is growling.
Wasn't me.
What?
- Smooth move, Nigel!
- Oh, boy!
Twins!
OK, Sammy, hurry it up now, 'cause these guys are seeming to have acid reflux or something!
Everybody... stay calm.
- Calm?
- Not good.
Yo.
Boo!
I'm gonna say, it looks like you and your crew here are a little far from your borough.
Far from your borough!
I love it.
We're going to the big water.
Nigel, show them what we're looking for.
- Like this?
- I think it's in her right hand.
- And isn't she blue?
- I can't do blue.
- No idea.
You?
- Doesn't even register.
- You're batting' zero, kid.
- Do the thing with...
Make your bloody mind up.
The big female with the spikes on her melon!
They're tourists.
All right, tourists, listen up.
Ya gotta get to Battery Park.
First take the Broadway culvert.
- Down the Broadway culvert?
- What's wrong with that?
- They get lost at the sewage plant!
- Get outta here!
- What are you talking about?
- How would you send 'em?
You're sendin' 'em the wrong way!
The Wall Street culvert is blocked with construction.
- That is true.
- All right.
Guys, you gonna help or not?
Yeah, sure.
Of course we're gonna help ya's.
We're one big family, right?
Except for that guy there.
He scares the...
You done runnin' your mouth yet, Carmine?
Are ya?
I apologize.
He never got over being flushed down the toilet.
Yeah.
Follow me, 'cause you four won't last ten minutes in this neighborhood.
It's a jungle down here.
- Stan, you know who that is?
- What?
No.
That's one of them talkin' kawana bears!
How ya doing?
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I've seen a lot of those things floating' here in the sewer.
That's good!
You're makin' me laugh over here.
Just wait for me!
Are we in the right place?
Any place without two hilarious alligators seems a move in the right direction.
- Sam, do you see anything up there?
- I sure do.
Well, well, well.
There she is, like Hamir said.
And it's sunrise, which means we're a tad short on time.
Guys, look.
We know the box Ryan's in is green.
It's gotta be around here, so I need you to...
Yeah.
So we should shout out if we see a box that looks like the ones over there.
It hasn't left yet!
We can make it!
- Let's go!
- Hold on, Larry!
- Which way now?
- Yeah, which way?
Run!
No!
No!
Ryan's on that thing!
We've got to stop it!
- We can't, Sam!
- I don't care!
- No, Sammy, you'll drown!
- Sam!
I failed.
Again.
I only count one failure.
It's big, but it's just one.
Goodbye, Ryan.
We're gonna miss ya.
- Samson!
- What on earth is going on?
It's a human and I do not think he works for the zoo.
Perhaps now is a good time to improvise.
What?
Great!
One problem down...
Far out.
Cool.
One disaster to go.
What are you doing?
We're headed for the other boat!
How do we steer?
Who knows how to steer?
None of us.
We're animals.
Great!
- Hold on, Larry.
Do that again.
- Do what?
Whatever you just did, but the opposite!
But I don't know my opposites!
No, Larry, like this!
I think I've got it.
Well, that was easy.
Oh, dear.
Has anyone got any eucalyptus wipes?
This isn't so difficult.
I'm the lion of the sea!
Well done, sir.
Captain of our team and now captain of this vessel.
You're brilliant.
I hate to be Miss Negative, but in this melee, we seem to have lost Ryan's boat.
- What, nothing?
- Nothing.
He's gone.
No.
There!
Nelson!
The green boxes!
- You're sure, eh?
- And there's my buddies!
And my love!
Let's go in!
- We'll head away from the sun.
- No, towards the sun.
To the north.
Starboard...
Leftboard.
Just follow my finger.
Please.
You guys wouldn't know the answer if it fell from the sky and hit you in the head.
Oh, my!
It's a bat!
It's a bat!
Get it off me!
Get it off me!
- Benny!
- Benny?
Geese!
- Are you all right?
- Yes, my princess.
Benny, you made it!
You're my best friend.
Best friends should stick together.
Even not-so-best friends, who knock you off a speeding garbage truck.
Excuse me, but I begged them to go back and get you.
Just so you know.
Benny, could you see Ryan's boat from up there?
Well, it just so happens I saw it heading that way.
And we're in luck!
- How's it goin', eh?
- Canadian geese!
Experts at intercontinental travel.
Hey, birdie, OK, is it true that Canada has lax immigration policies for koalas?
I'll take it from here.
My son's out there.
We really need your help.
Can you lead us to that boat?
No problem, eh?
Just follow us and Bob's your uncle.
Try not to lag too far behind, eh?
Hey, Benny, thanks.
And FYI, Bridget was very concerned when you fell off the truck.
Bet you didn't know I could ride geese, did you?
- Bareback.
- Oh, brother.
Sammy?
We going to the wild now?
I think we are, Larry.
I can't take it anymore.
He's taunting us!
Listen!
Stop laughing at us, you solar twit!
Captain Bligh, sir!
Are the ice cream cones ready?
The crew, they're on the verge of mutiny.
Nigel, please.
If you don't give us ice creams pretty quick, you're gonna walk the plank, sir!
- Nigel.
- I don't care if I drown,
I'm getting off this death cruise right now.
Iceberg!
Permission to go down with the ship, sir.
Hang on!
Stuff that!
Run!
Swim!
Nigel?
Look, I'm a starfish.
Guys, look.
Gosh.
Must feel like a lifetime since you've been here.
Yeah... a lifetime.
What the heck?
Wow!
Look!
They're releasing the green boxes back into the wild.
- Larry.
- Guys, they're putting animals inside the green boxes.
I just can't figure out why.
It's a tunnel to another dimension, can't you see?
- They go in...
- Who is this guy?
It's all right, Nigel.
Think it has anything to do with that?
Hang on a second.
Either I'm starving or Larry is making sense.
You're right.
Those animals are being rescued.
Ryan?
Ryan!
Oh, no!
Ryan!
We've got to move fast!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Where are you, buddy?
Ryan!
- I can't believe it!
- Samson!
I was so close.
He was right there!
- We'll never find him now!
- Come here!
Will you get a hold of yourself?
Use your instincts.
I don't want to run anymore.
Good. 'Cause frankly, you need a good sports bra.
- Ryan?
- Everything's under control.
- Temporary setback.
- I got it.
- I got Ryan's scent!
- He got it?
I mean, he got it!
Let's go!
- Hooray!
- Wait for us!
I'm not designed for this!
I want a car.
Hey, guys, I found him!
Ryan!
Doesn't anyone knock anymore?
Where's my son?
Did he come through here?
Yeah, now that I think about it, he did come through here.
Hello?
Come on out, baby lion!
Your dad's here!
Well, what do you know?
There's a whole pride of lions here!
Funky.
I was under the impression you had Ryan's scent, not this olfactory insult.
I...
I had Ryan's scent, but my predator instincts must've kicked in since, you know, I haven't eaten for a while.
Exactly!
You never know when those instincts are gonna kick in.
Excellent.
Fantastic!
We get to see the legend in action.
I'd love to, but we just don't have time.
We got the time, Sammy.
Just...
And then you do this.
And then this bit.
Rip him apart!
The horror.
I can't bear to watch!
But I have to.
Go on.
Get out of here.
- The legend dropped his dinner.
- Oh, boy.
What's wrong?
I'm not good enough for you to eat?
No.
It's just I'm allergic to nuts.
Now I get it.
You're gonna toy with me?
Beat me up a little, then pounce when I get my hopes up?
How exciting.
Come on, guys.
Ryan can't be far.
Hey!
I'm not finished with you!
I am a delicacy.
My flesh has fruity wood notes!
Watch it, you little hors d'oeuvre.
That's Samson the Wild.
You call this wild?
This is a cat!
A big, fat, tame pussycat!
- OK, that's enough!
- The pussycat hissed at me!
Maybe I should hide behind the koala for protection.
While we're at it, could you slap me in the face?
No.
What are you, a twit?
- Ignore him.
- Don't bother!
I'm leaving.
- You're weird.
- Run for your lives!
It's a lion with moral issues!
And I've had it with you too!
Thanks a lot for wrecking my day!
Teensy question.
Or more like a...
a sort of a query meets a statement.
That hyrax back there?
It was sort of like you couldn't eat him.
Yeah, and what about those dogs?
There was no munching there, either.
If I didn't know any better, I'd say that you're...
- A vegetarian?
- Nope.
- That's not what I was going to say.
- You were going to say...
- It's almost like...
- You're not from...
The wild?
Well, you're right.
I'm not from the wild.
What?
I'm just a phony.
Truth is I can't protect you out here.
Please just go back to the boat.
I've got to find my son.
Tell me we're not in a dangerous jungle with an 8-inch squirrel protecting us.
Actually, I'm nine inches, but other than that, yes.
So that means...
We are going to die!
Hey, guys!
Guys!
Will the three of you calm down?
How could he lie to us?
- We're his best friends.
- Sure.
Maybe he lied 'cause he didn't want to tell us the truth.
OK, yeah, whatever.
Whatever.
Let's just go back to the boat, then.
The fierce, the proud, the wild...
Rubbish!
But wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait!
Where you goin'?
Stop right there!
Stop!
Bridget, if you go, I'm...
I'm breaking up with you.
We were never going out in the first place.
Then we're taking a break.
- Nigel!
- All right!
Hey, listen!
I know you're scared.
But at least we got each other.
Sammy's got nobody.
He's out there all alone.
And... so is Ryan.
OK, OK, focus, Samson.
He's got to be out there somewhere.
You'll find him.
I mean, how big can this place be, anyway?
Ryan!
Hey there, little fella.
You're lost too, huh?
You remind me of my buddy back home.
A bloodthirsty monster!
Where?
Where?
He's a killer!
Get away from my baby!
Calm down, lady!
Won't anyone save my baby?
Bye-bye.
Ryan!
Ryan!
Sammy!
I wasn't meant for the wild.
I was made to nibble and be elegant and to appear in children's books as the letter G.
Come on, this isn't scary, is it?
It's just leaves and vines and...
Oh, that's my foot.
Nigel, keep a lookout back there.
- You too, Larry!
- Okeydokey.
Oh, I see.
All right, OK, yeah.
You're giving me the silent treatment.
Like I care.
Nigel!
I gave you an order.
Would a little "Sir, yes, sir!" kill ya?
Nigel.
That's not funny, Nigel.
- He's gone!
We're doomed.
- Nigel!
First Ryan, then Samson, and now Nigel!
I do believe in zoos.
- Larry, you're tensing up!
- I do, I do, I do.
- Don't panic.
I'm in charge.
- That's why we're panicking!
I say we fan out and circle.
What are we, peacocks?
We don't fan, we run.
Run for your lives, everybody!
Guys, I've got an idea.
Why don't we ask them?
It's OK...
They, you see, they got hooves.
That means they don't hunt.
They graze.
But they're licking their chops.
I'll take the one with the funny knees.
The funny knee...?
Benny, no!
Benny?
Get them.
Just, hey, back off.
I'm sorry,
I'm not that kind of koala bear.
Right.
Excuse me?
Hello?
Terribly sorry to bother you, but do you speak koala?
Sprechen Sie koala?
Right.
Could you possibly not go towards the big smoking thing?
G'day, mate G'day, mate
G'day, mate G'day, mate
G'day, mate G'day, mate
What a strange place for a party.
Very good, very organized.
Can I use your toilet?
I'm having a
Really nice day Really nice day
Really nice day
I'm having a
Really nice day Really nice day
Really nice day
- Why don't you all
- Tickle away, tickle away
They're frighteningly horrible monster beasts but they're not bad dancers.
I'm so cuddly I like you
I'm so cuddly I like you
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
- I'm having a
- Really nice day
Oh, no!
Tickle away Tickle away
I'm so cuddly, I like you Good day
- What is that?
- I am Kazar.
Leader.
Prophet.
Choreographer.
And with your help... carnivore!
No!
Don't kill me!
I've had such a weird life!
This is not fair.
Oh, I get it.
A yoga retreat.
Ryan!
You can do this.
Use your instincts.
Follow your instincts.
Use your instincts.
OK.
Down this way.
This way.
A lion cub.
We must tell Kazar.
- It's my turn to tell him.
- You got to last time.
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!
Thank you very much, but I'm afraid I've got to run.
Koalas are very busy bees.
If I could...
I'll just buzz along to the door...
For centuries, we've watched our brethren perish at the claw of the lion.
Today, we put our hooves down.
No longer will we dwell at the bottom of the food chain.
Well, yes.
I should say so.
There were those who doubted that you'd arrive to lead us.
But I always believed in the Omen.
The Omen!
Right.
Remind me again?
Sent down by the gods years ago...
Oh, no!
Not you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
Oh, Great Him, you must lead us in our transformation from prey to predator.
Hold it.
I am the Great Him?
- The Great Him?
- Him.
So this is all your fault!
That's it!
You...!
- Kazar!
- Kazar!
Don't listen to him!
- Kazar!
Over here!
- Kazar!
Over here!
How dare you interrupt my audience with the Great Him!
But... but we found a lion cub!
- You did?
- Was he with a big lion?
With big hair?
Well, a mullet, really.
Oh, Great Him, you brought two lions with you?
Well, like any Great Him,
I travel with an entourage.
Worry not, Your Himness, I shall have Blag bring the lions here.
And he better not screw this up, like you screwed up my dance number!
I lost count for one verse.
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
Why do we even bother rehearsing?
A good chorus line is so hard to put together.
Take to the skies!
We're taking!
We're taking!
- Find them!
- Yes, sir.
Bring us those lions!
The gods celebrate the fulfillment of the prophecy.
We stamp our hooves in praise of the Great Him!
Holy moly!
Holy moly Holy moly
You are our king!
Looky, looky who's there.
Surprise!
No!
Sorry we're late for dinner!
That's pathetic!
Get off!
- That didn't hurt!
- Stop!
- Ryan!
- No!
I'm coming, son!
Dad?
- Help!
- Let's scram!
- Ryan!
- What are you doing here?
- I can't believe it!
I found you.
- How'd you find me?
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
- Your paw.
- I got trapped in that box.
It's OK, son.
And then I escaped, and I ran into the jungle then those vultures came and tried to kill me.
You wouldn't have been scared.
I was.
- I have to tell you something.
- What?
Listen.
- Get 'em, Dad!
- Run!
Run!
Dad, you should be chasing them!
- Like you used to!
- Those were just stories!
But now's your chance to show me for real!
This way!
- Dad?
What's goin' on?
- Just get up into that tree!
- I think we lost them.
- What's the deal?
They're just a bunch of wimpy donkeys!
You could kick their rumps!
- Ryan, I can't fight them.
- You donkey-chickens!
Get back here!
Ryan!
I can't fight them.
What do you mean?
I was young still just a cub.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Children of all ages.
Samson!
Swallow that fear and stand tall!
Witness the greatest day in our young lion's life!
The day he discovers his roar!
Dad, I can't do it!
Now, go!
Listen as Samson unleashes a roar so mighty, it launches a wildebeest clear off the savannah!
Samson!
Dig deep!
I should have known.
If you'd been born in the wild, you'd know how to roar.
Dad?
Dad!
Dad!
Please!
Dad.
When they shipped me to the zoo, I never wanted anyone to know where I came from.
Especially those closest to me.
I should have told you sooner.
But... all those stories you tell?
I'm so sorry, Ryan.
Everything you told me was a lie?
- Dad!
- Hang on, son.
Help!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Run!
Not so fast, Tigger.
Dad!
Ryan!
Dad!
- Help!
- Ryan.
Help!
Dad!
- Ryan.
- Dad!
Help me!
What?
Wait!
What?
What?
Wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Get off me!
What is goin' on here?
- Stinky does not speak.
- It rolls like a little ball.
Wait.
You guys think I'm a...?
- Achtung, Stinky!
- Less talk, more roll.
- Ja.
- Roll!
Roll!
What the...?
Hey!
Rolling the dung is good for tight buns!
I'll give you something to roll about!
It's a good thing Bridget didn't see that!
Bridget?
Larry!
They're gone.
I gotta find them!
No!
I gotta find Samson first!
No!
First...
Sam.
Sam!
Bridget!
Larry!
Oh, Ryan!
You're alive!
Good to see you guys.
- Where's my hug?
- Larry.
- There it is.
- It's good to see you too.
What are you guys doing here?
We came here with your father to find you.
And he's probably out there right now lookin' for us.
I wish he were.
But some of these wildebeests pushed him off a cliff.
- What?
- What?
I don't think he made it.
I don't see how he could.
Oh, Ryan.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Kazar, I think you'll be very pleased with what I brought you.
What's this?
Where's the other lion?
Right.
Well, I was gonna tell you, there was this cliff and...
Why are you looking at me like that?
That's twice you've been out of step today, Blag!
You klutz.
You know we can't ascend to the top of the food chain until we eat a lion!
Well, at least there'll be enough for my ascension.
What about the rest of us?
Step-kick, pivot-kick!
Ouch!
I twisted a hoof!
You work and you work.
Then they break your heart.
- There goes my career!
- Prepare the sacrifices!
Why did I let him go off by himself?
He couldn't catch a cold, much less his own lunch.
Bet I could catch you.
Please.
My natural predator is fuel inject...
What?
I knew you weren't really gone.
I knew it!
Come on, I knew it!
We're still buddies, right?
I lost Ryan.
There were too many.
They just took him.
Who?
Who took him?
- Wildebeests.
- The freaks with the hooves!
They got Larry and Bridget too.
Couldn't fight, couldn't...
Come on, Sam.
You're a lion.
You come from a long line of kings.
Yeah, maybe you're not from the wild.
But fighting's in your blood!
No.
I'll never be a real lion.
Wrong!
You are a real lion.
Doesn't matter where you're from:
Zoo, jungle, goldfish bowl.
It's what's in here.
That determines who you are!
At least, that's what you always told your son.
Now he's out there, Sammy, and he needs you.
Who else is gonna teach him how to roar?
That's it, Sammy.
That's it.
Let's go find my son...
and my friends.
Yeah!
Nothing's gonna stop us!
Except that we have no idea where we're going!
Follow your instincts.
Follow your instincts.
- What is that?
- My... instincts?
- Benny?
- You're almost there.
That settles it, then.
My mother definitely drank pool water when she was pregnant with me.
Benny, look.
The freaks with hooves!
Ryan's in there.
You can't just barge in.
That's suicide!
- Benny, get out of my way!
- Don't listen to the rat.
- Hey, who are you calling a rat?
- You, of course.
- You'll give away our position.
- I'll have you written up for that!
Fool!
You blew our cover!
Men!
Scatter!
Not so fast!
Look who I got, Sammy.
It's your lion instincts.
Who are you guys?
- Our names aren't important.
- I'm Cloak.
He's Camo.
- We're covert agents.
- Why have you been leading me around?
- That's classified.
- Top-secret.
- The wildebeests have gone mad.
- Cloak.
It's not like I told them our plan is to use them to defeat Kazar's...
Listen, just tell me, did they take my son in there?
- That's need-to-know.
- They did.
- They think the koala's a god.
- You're the worst covert agent!
Oh, yeah?
Then why can I do this?
Men!
Hey!
No!
Stop!
Sammy!
- Idiot!
That maneuver's confidential.
- It's secret.
This one's confidential.
- Cloak!
- And this one's restricted.
Super-secret.
Top-secret.
This is ultra-secret!
Enough!
No more!
Show 'em the super-top-secret "no more?" Gotcha!
No!
I got an idea.
Who is this Great Him, anyway?
I'll take him on.
I'm the Great Her!
I'll show Him a thing or two.
I'm from New York City, for Pete's sake.
Oh, my.
You have got to be kidding me.
Nigel, I don't know what you're trying to pull,
- but I will kick your...
- Silence!
Why, you little...
Silence, again!
You do not speak to me!
Nigel, what's the deal?
Great Him, shall we prepare the feast?
Yes, we shall!
What's on the menu?
Them.
Oh, no.
Eat friends and be god, don't eat friends...
God, friends, god, friends.
God, I...
Well, that was subtle.
Prepare the meat fire!
Wait!
We cannot cook them without onion!
Onions.
Onions.
Onions.
Well, that was fast.
Let the ritual begin.
Move it!
I am so mad at you!
Wait!
We also need... hats!
Do we not have the party hats of death?
I've got mine!
And before the feast, we must all...
What the...?
...levitate and spin uncontrollably!
And feel a bit sick.
How do I stop this thing?
- Guys.
- Benny?
- Look, a squirrel!
- Larry!
We've got a plan.
Follow me.
- We?
- I can fly!
Oh, Great Him, we are humbled by your power.
Be humbled.
Only the Great Him can do this!
- Volcanic gas!
- Our cover's blown!
Major malfunction!
Abandon ship!
- Oh, boy.
- Well, about time you got here.
Great Him, it's another miracle!
You've delivered us a real lion!
Blag, your luck has turned.
Thanks to the Great Him, we shall all ascend tonight.
Nigel, we've got to create a distraction.
Hang on a sec!
I've got miracles comin' out my ears!
Ready?
Stand back as the Great Me attacks the lion over 73 times my size!
Dad?
My dad's alive!
Guys, my dad made it!
- Ryan, no!
- Hurry, I got to see him!
Whack, whack, whack!
- Dad!
- What?
Ryan!
- I planned this.
- Ryan, no!
At long last, the cosmic balance has shifted.
- Stay close.
- Prey has become predator!
And predator has become prey!
And the hoof finally trumps the claw!
Come on, Dad!
Let's show these turkey-jerkies who's at the top of the food chain!
Let's eat the brat first.
Over my dead body!
Yeah.
Dad!
He's gonna kill Samson if we don't do something!
Why don't we use the secret play?
I know.
Shut up, Larry.
That's stupid.
No!
It's brilliant!
They laughed at me when I spoke of the Omen.
But look who's laughing now!
Little to the left.
Yeah.
No!
Little to the right!
Next floor:
Bottom of the food chain!
Ding!
Fire!
We gotta find something bigger!
I know where we can find something bigger.
- Ready, Ryan?
- Dig deep!
You should have stayed at home.
Now our shrine will become your tomb.
Fire!
Ryan!
Ryan!
I don't typically eat dessert before the main course!
Get away from my son!
Ryan.
Ryan, are you still with me?
It's OK, Dad.
I just want you to know
I'm sorry you didn't have a father like the one I have.
Ryan.
How touching.
But then, last words usually are.
Finish them.
What are you doing?
I command you to attack them, like true predators!
We're tired of pretending to be something we're not.
But most of all, we're tired of you.
Blag.
Fine.
I'll kill them myself!
Dad, remember what you always told me in your stories:
Dig deep.
Oh, yeah, baby!
Let's go.
Yeah.
- Come on, let's get out of here!
- Get out of here!
And for the record, I've always hated your choreography.
It's so... '80s.
That's right!
Run!
Run like the cowardly prey that you are!
I will hunt you down!
Everyone!
To the boat!
Top of the food chain, Ma!
Top of the food chain...
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
Hurry!
We're never gonna make it!
Push, you crazy, hairy monsters!
Push!
- Larry, throw it in reverse!
- Reverse throwing!
At least I saw the wild before it disappeared.
I can still see it.
It's right...
Here.
I found my roar.
We both did, son.
You know, Dad, this'll be our first story of Samson and Ryan the Wild.
I don't think anybody's gonna believe it.
Incoming!
I'm so cuddly!
Cuddly!
I'm so cuddly!
I know you're cuddly.
But can you float?
- I'm having a
- Really nice day
Really nice day Really nice day
Step-kick left!
Really nice day
Step-kick right!
- Splendid.
- No!
Smashing.
Hey!
- Stupendous!
- Are you guys sure about this?
Operation Snake-Over is now complete.
Hey, look, everyone!
I'm a secret agent!
Bridget, I get it.
You're more than a tall, lanky goddess.
You're a strong, independent female.
You don't need to be defined by your relationship
- and I, I respect that.
- It's about time.
What was that?
Just your daily dose of vitamin Bridget, baby.
Oh, yeah yeah!
Really nice day Really nice day
Look out!
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
Yes!
Did y'all see that?
Check this!
Go, Blag!
Go, Blag!
Go, Blag!
Hey, Blag.
- No parking' on the dance floor.
- Parkin'?
Dad?
Make some room there, big guy!
Really nice day Really, really nice day
Yeah!
Pretty crazy, right?
Pretty wild!
Well, technically, it...
It's awesome.
Yes, right.
- I was just gonna say that.
- Come on!
Everyone!
This is gonna be a long ride home.
I'm havin' a
Really nice day Really nice day, really nice day
- I'm having a
- I'm so cuddly, I like you
G'day
What are you doing this for?
What, do you think it's funny?
Just get out.
Sorry about that, everybody.
Sorry.
Hello.
Do carry on.
Come on!
All right, everybody exit in an orderly...
All right, single file!
Keep it...
I seem to do a lot of falling and screaming in this adventure.
So there I was, face to face with the biggest, meanest leopard on this side of the Serengeti.
And...
You roared so loud, his spots flew clean off.
Dad, I've heard this like a billion times.
Do you know the one where I made the laughing hyenas...
Cry?
Yep.
- The croc attack?
- Dad.
OK.
Think.
Yeah, you do that.
All right, Mr. Smart Guy, here's one I know you haven't heard.
It all started in the little place I like to call the wild.
They were the fastest wildebeests on the savannah.
We're talking fast.
All the other lions had given up the hunt hours ago, except your old man.
Fortunately, I knew a short cut.
I thought I had 'em.
Until the dust cleared.
Classic wildebeest trap.
So, what did you do next?
- What did I do?
- Yeah.
That's when I gave them the roar.
- That's it?
- Hold on a sec.
I only thought it was over.
But they had a secret weapon.
He was the biggest wildebeest I've ever seen.
- He was 14 feet tall!
- Fourteen?
I meant 1,401 feet tall!
Cool.
And he had two...
No, four of the biggest horns I'd ever seen.
- Whoa!
- His breath was red hot!
I mean, green.
And he hated the environment.
To pull this off, I knew I was gonna have to dig deep, deeper than I ever had before.
So I swallowed my fear, sucked in the biggest breath I could.
Dad, I'm ready!
- You got it?
- I got it!
- I got it!
- Well, let him have it!
Roar, son!
Story of my life.
Your roar stops a herd of wildebeests.
Mine makes the babies laugh.
Hey, come on.
That was much better.
I'm serious!
It dropped half an octave.
It dropped half an octave.
And it sure scared me.
- Made my hair stand up on end.
- Yeah, right, Dad.
- OK.
Let's take it from the top.
- I'm done for today.
Come on, come on, one more.
You were so close.
Maybe it's something technical.
Maybe you're not opening your mouth wide enough.
Like this.
Dad, thanks for the technical help, but if you wanted me to roar like you, you'd take me to the wild.
Hold on a second.
We've got everything we could ever want here.
Great lifestyle, three squares a day.
- It's boring.
- Boring?
- I'll never learn how to roar here.
- Ryan.
But don't worry.
I finally figured out
- how we can get to the wild.
- You did?
The pigeons say those green boxes go there.
Those boxes are bad news.
Stay away.
- But, Dad...
- I know you're frustrated,
- but a lion finds his roar...
- Here.
I'm so tired of hearing that, Dad!
It's a rat!
Get that rat off my baby!
A rat?
Hello!
Silly, silly rat.
- Rats do not got bling like this, lady.
- You little...!
Lastly, that is the ugliest baby I've ever seen!
Benny, stealing candy from a baby?
Stealing is such a strong word.
I prefer "liberating."
Hey, kid, heard the roar.
Down another...
- Octave.
- Octave!
You ready to cheer me and your old man as we capture our fifth straight turtle-curling title?
I can't even roar.
How would you even know I'm there?
So, you really think it dropped an octave?
Absolutely.
- What the heck is an octave?
- I heard that.
- Rabbit.
- Cholesterol.
I'll stick with the nuts.
I don't know what his problem is, Benny.
He's 11, but he's still roaring at a nine-year-old level.
Little help here, Sammy?
You know what?
Maybe you're setting the bar too high, with all those stories about Samson the Wild.
Hey, he's always loved those stories!
They inspire him.
OK.
I'm not gonna argue with someone who can use my tail as dental floss.
- You got something right there.
- Where?
- No, no, other side.
- Here?
- Sorry, Benny.
- You got it.
Attention, friends.
Stop by the gift shop and get the most popular plush in America:
Nigel, the "l-Like-You" Koala.
- Look, honey!
The crazy thing talks!
- I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
That's right.
He's so cuddly.
And better yet, he likes you.
Finally.
And the zoo will officially be ours in T-minus three two and showtime!
Here I come!
Who put that bar there?
That tickles!
- Did too!
- Did not!
- Did too!
- Did not!
Out of my way, ya bum!
There's that moth-eaten koala!
I've told you flamingos a hundred times, walk.
- How about an autograph?
!
- Don't...
Birds!
Find the string on his back!
- So you're havin' a really nice day!
- Guys.
Off my co-captain, now.
Sorry, Samson.
That didn't hurt.
I almost forgot to tell you.
I'm gonna ask Bridget out finally.
Slow down, Romeo.
You are a squirrel and she is...
Perfect, right?
Look, I know what you're sayin'.
Believe me, I got my eyes wide open.
Watch where you're goin', you big...!
Bridget.
Don't stare at my spots, Benny.
My eyes are up here.
Of course.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, this is for you, honey.
It goes around your left hoof.
Did you get that out of the trash?
You did!
You trash-picker!
I'm not a trash-picker.
I'm a recycler.
That's a lot more romantic.
Isn't it?
- Romantic?
- Sam, come here.
Romantic?
Don't mention romance to me, Benny.
- I've never had a boyfriend.
- That settles it.
I accept the job...
of boyfriend number one.
Benny, only the female orb-weaver spider will date a male one-twentieth her size.
- So there's hope!
- And then she eats him.
But at least he dies happy.
Let's get Ryan, dude!
Dude!
We said that at the same time!
Dude.
Hey!
Hey, Ryan.
Listen, I'm headin' down to the game.
I'm gonna see you there, right?
Come on, Ryan.
We need you.
You're our biggest fan.
Yo, Samson!
I'm your number one fan, man!
Thanks, man.
Right back at ya!
You were saying, Dad?
Listen.
About this afternoon, I was just trying...
Dad, fine.
I'll go to your game, all right?
OK.
I'll... see you there, then.
Come on, dude.
- Dude.
- Guess who's here?
Eze.
Duke.
Man, he always guesses.
We're gonna stalk the gazelles while everybody's at the game.
- You in?
- Let's go, bro!
The Ryanator.
I'm comin' down.
Fish heads!
Get your ice-cold fish heads!
Now eyeball-free!
We're into the final period of the curling championships and the penguins are up.
Here comes Victor.
What a beauty!
Yeah, sweep!
Heading straight for the bull's-eye!
This could be it, folks!
- Bo-wango!
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah!
- That's gonna be tough to beat.
What? "Tough to beat"?
That's just the way we like it, right, guys?
I can't believe this!
If we lose, I'm gonna rip my head off!
And yours!
We cannot lose to flightless birds!
Whoa, whoa.
No one is losing anything around here.
As long as we stay focused.
- By the way, has anyone seen Ryan?
- Oh!
I know!
Maybe he's sulking 'cause he lives in his father's shadow and he roars like a schoolgirl.
- Thanks, Lar.
- You betcha!
Nigel!
Nigel!
Will you sign my dolly?
- Not again.
- Nigel, ignore them.
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
- You're so cuddly!
We love you!
- That's it!
I am not cuddly!
I'm a vicious jungle animal from the streets of London!
- Fear me!
- Get him!
Get him!
Get him!
- Help me!
- Girls!
Put him down.
I am not a doll!
- Cushy tushy!
- Leave my bum alone!
Nigel!
Get your paws off my girlfriend!
Benny, I am not your girlfriend!
Really nice day!
What is up with Samson's team tonight?
Brutal!
Benny?
Oh, my gosh!
Who knows mouth-to-mouth?
I do!
What was that?
Just your daily dose of vitamin Benny, baby.
- Get off my nose.
- I'm so cuddly, I like you!
- Stop saying that!
- G'day, mate!
Cannonball!
Next year, I should just coach.
Check it.
The Thomson gazelle.
Zero to 50 in four-point-five seconds.
- The ultimate fleeing machine.
- There is no substitute.
Let's get a closer look at these slim jims.
- Shall we?
- I think we shall.
Maybe we should just go to the game.
- I thought you wanted to be wild.
- Your dad chased gazelles.
Yeah, if he were our age, he would so be rockin' out with us.
He'd be in there, runnin' 'em down like they were...
- Gazelles.
- Yeah, gazelles or somethin'.
Ready, man?
We'd better not.
Oh, yeah?
Are you gonna stop us?
- Guys, guys.
- Here we go!
The whole series comes down to this throw!
There's no tomorrow!
It's do or die!
Ya know what I mean.
Guys, I know we're down, but we're gonna pull this out 'cause we're gonna use the secret play.
- The secret play!
Hey, everybody, guess what?
We're gonna use the secret play!
Larry, the first part of the secret play is keeping it secret.
- OK.
- Follow my lead.
I'm going to need a double effort from everybody.
Absolutely, captain.
Triple effort if you want, sir.
- Good.
Ready, and...
- Break!
Quiet.
On three, dude.
One, two...
No!
Now you did it, Ryan.
Feelin' mean, Donald?
Bring it on!
Folks, there's pressure on the big guy!
- Ready, Bridget?
- Ready.
- Ready, Benny?
- Ready!
Samson, it's a shame your little brat isn't here to see you lose.
I can't... hold it!
Oh, no!
What are you doin'?
And here comes Samson.
Look at that guy.
Is he a beauty or what?
Larry!
Bridget!
Sweep!
What a recovery!
He's sendin' in Bridget and Larry to do the job!
Sweep faster, Larry!
Sweep, sweep!
- I am!
- Come on, man!
Team Penguin is sending their ace, Victor...
- Watch it, Victor!
- Watch it yourself, see?
Nigel, how are we looking?
- This could be trouble, folks!
- Sweep, sweep, sweep.
This is cheating and you will die for this.
I can't hear you, Nigel.
Move left a bit...
OK.
Move left and hit!
- Larry, no!
- Tallyho!
What a move!
Folks, we are inches away from the greatest upset in turtle-curling history!
- Oh, no!
I can't believe my eyes!
- No!
Looks like Samson might have choked!
- Nice!
- Yes!
Unbelievable!
Samson and his team have clinched the title!
- No, wait!
I've called it too soon!
- What the heck?
The penguins have done it!
They're zoo champs for the first time!
Stampede?
Stampede!
Please!
Stop!
Watch out!
Dude.
Busted.
Catastrophic.
Told you I'd come to the game.
You think this is funny?
You just endangered everyone in the zoo!
- I'm sorry.
- For what?
Chasing the gazelles or costing us the game?
All you do is sit up in your tree and sulk.
- If you just...
- What's the problem?
Is all this because you can't roar?
Ryan, I didn't mean that.
Know what I'm doing when I'm sulking in my tree?
I'm thinking how great it would be if Samson the Wild wasn't my father.
Ryan, I didn't...
'Cause it would make being Ryan the Lame a lot easier.
Ryan, I'm sorry.
Ryan!
Please don't leave.
Bye, Ryan!
Thanks for coming to the game.
And you were worried he wouldn't show up.
Not good.
No one listens to the squirrel.
I don't know what to do anymore, Benny.
- I've tried everything.
- Everything?
- You tried everything?
- What are you saying?
I'm saying you have to tell him the truth.
I don't think I could do that, Benny.
I mean...
What's he gonna think of me when he finds out?
I don't know.
But if you don't tell him you're gonna lose him, Sammy.
The green boxes.
OK, they're all loaded up!
- You don't think I know that?
- Get movin'!
I changed my mind!
I don't wanna go!
Help!
Ryan.
Help me!
Watch out!
Sam!
- Wait for us!
- Dad!
- Ryan!
- Dad!
Don't let them take me!
- No!
- Ryan!
Help!
- No!
- Dad!
Help me!
Ryan!
- Benny, we need that truck followed.
- Check.
Get me... the pigeons.
I am wanting snake eyes!
Come on, baby.
Come on, just throw it.
Thanks.
Hamir!
You are the great loser of all time!
What offerings must I make, I wonder?
Hamir!
Hamir!
Get a grip on yourself!
Benny!
I am needing till Friday before I am paying you back!
No, no.
It's Ryan.
He's in one of those green boxes and they took it away!
We've got to find him!
That is not good!
Not good at all!
I know!
I know!
I am telling him, you crazy pigeon!
The green boxes go to the big water where stiff lady with spikes on her head...
- Hamir?
I can't understand...
- Spikes!
Just tell me where the green boxes go.
Stiff lady, spikies?
Yes, like my wife says, the truck takes them to her!
To her!
Though I hate telling bad news, there is more bad news to tell.
When the sun rises, the green boxes leave on boat-boat and never return!
I am sorry for this.
I really am.
Hello?
No.
Not good.
Not good.
You always say that.
I keep on sayin' it.
No one's listenin'.
Like a broken record here.
OK.
When do we leave, Sammy?
Yeah, when do we leave?
It's not "we." It's me.
Let's make this clear.
This is now a rescue mission and I am the only one going.
We'll come too!
We're not afraid.
Are we, guys?
Afraid?
No.
You know koalas.
More like "scared of things."
Ryan's like a cub to all of us.
Not that I'll ever have one of my own at this rate.
You know, there's that famous...
A koala once said,
"We will fight them... with peaches."
Yeah.
Anyway.
- So we're helping, whatever it takes.
- You want to leave with me?
OK.
If you don't mind being hunted down, shot at stuffed...
- OK!
...or worse, then fine.
I have a recurring nightmare about taxidermy and spot remover.
Well, they have to catch us before they can stuff us and I'm fast.
Nobody's leaving but me.
Got it?
- You're the boss.
- You bet.
- You got the big hair.
- Absolutely.
Yeah, that's good, Sammy.
Hey, way to weed out the weak links.
Now that they're out of the picture, what's the plan?
Don't worry about a thing, big guy.
I got it all taken care of.
I know this city like the back of my paw.
We ditch this truck at Fifth Avenue, couple lefts, couple rights, bada-boom, past Broadway and...
You're there!
What are you doing here?
- What?
- We're going to help you find Ryan!
She said, "We're gonna help you find Ryan."
- Oh, great.
- Hey, guys.
I've got popcorn up my bum.
Do I look trashy in this?
OK, here's my...
Here's my overall plan.
Where are we going?
I only have until sunrise before Ryan is taken away forever!
And now I have to worry about you three?
All right, fine.
When do we get off of this thing, Benny?
Benny's here?
Yeah, he's right there.
Benny?
Benny!
Great.
Now what am I gonna do?
Guys!
Guys!
I think we should duck!
What is she saying?
She said, "Duck down!"
Duck!
I am not in the mood for a game of footsie or hoofsie or pawsie or...
That wasn't my paw.
It was this!
I didn't steal it.
I borrowed it.
It'll light the way to Ryan.
The walls are moving.
Right, right.
The walls...
The walls are moving!
Larry, hold your breath!
Larry, stay straight!
Everybody out!
All right, don't panic.
What we've got to do...
This is definitely not good.
Samson!
- Give me your hoof!
- Help!
Larry!
The garbage!
It lives!
Guys?
OK, anybody?
I'm freakin' out.
- What's the hold up?
- Hello?
We're over here, Nigel.
Right.
I'll be there in a minute.
Think.
What did Benny say?
Couple of lefts, couple of rights.
Bridget, can you see the green lady?
I'm looking, I'm looking, but I can't see over anything for a change.
How far are you away?
You in a different continent?
Is that you, Larry?
Up here, Nige.
You're a very furry snake.
Guys...
We don't want to draw attention to ourselves.
Dogs.
This should be fun for you, Samson.
Nigel!
Grab Bridget!
- What?
- Run!
I'm gonna throw up!
I'm gonna throw up!
Shouldn't you be tearing them to shreds?
All part of the plan.
This maneuver's known as the Serengeti Slip.
Page ten of the Predator's Playbook.
What next?
Page 11?
Go on, you mutts!
Stupid dogs, we could've taken you.
Taken you to a...
To a disco!
Larry, improvise!
- Larry, that's not helping.
- OK.
You dogs think you got bark?
Well, Samson's got roar!
- Show 'em, Sam.
- Dig deep, Samson.
You're a lion.
Be a lion.
Look at that guy!
Sam, they are frothing at the mouth.
OK...
- Larry, coil!
- Check!
- Sam!
- I improvised.
Now jump!
- Down there?
- Yes!
We're leaving, Larry!
Teensy question, Samson.
With those dogs up there, why didn't you just do what you did in the wild?
You know, lionize 'em or lionate them or lionify them?
I don't have time to fight dogs, Bridget.
We have to find Ryan, remember?
What is this stinky place?
Lt appears to be a human bathing area.
You mean humans don't lick themselves clean?
Disgusting!
They're hopeless.
It is hard to believe they are at the top of the food chain.
I can't imagine beginning the day without licking myself.
No hurry, but is there a plan?
Of course there's a plan.
We follow this water to the big water, and then we find the lady with...
Larry, either your stomach is growling or something in it is growling.
Wasn't me.
What?
- Smooth move, Nigel!
- Oh, boy!
Twins!
OK, Sammy, hurry it up now, 'cause these guys are seeming to have acid reflux or something!
Everybody... stay calm.
- Calm?
- Not good.
Yo.
Boo!
I'm gonna say, it looks like you and your crew here are a little far from your borough.
Far from your borough!
I love it.
We're going to the big water.
Nigel, show them what we're looking for.
- Like this?
- I think it's in her right hand.
- And isn't she blue?
- I can't do blue.
- No idea.
You?
- Doesn't even register.
- You're batting' zero, kid.
- Do the thing with...
Make your bloody mind up.
The big female with the spikes on her melon!
They're tourists.
All right, tourists, listen up.
Ya gotta get to Battery Park.
First take the Broadway culvert.
- Down the Broadway culvert?
- What's wrong with that?
- They get lost at the sewage plant!
- Get outta here!
- What are you talking about?
- How would you send 'em?
You're sendin' 'em the wrong way!
The Wall Street culvert is blocked with construction.
- That is true.
- All right.
Guys, you gonna help or not?
Yeah, sure.
Of course we're gonna help ya's.
We're one big family, right?
Except for that guy there.
He scares the...
You done runnin' your mouth yet, Carmine?
Are ya?
I apologize.
He never got over being flushed down the toilet.
Yeah.
Follow me, 'cause you four won't last ten minutes in this neighborhood.
It's a jungle down here.
- Stan, you know who that is?
- What?
No.
That's one of them talkin' kawana bears!
How ya doing?
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I've seen a lot of those things floating' here in the sewer.
That's good!
You're makin' me laugh over here.
Just wait for me!
Are we in the right place?
Any place without two hilarious alligators seems a move in the right direction.
- Sam, do you see anything up there?
- I sure do.
Well, well, well.
There she is, like Hamir said.
And it's sunrise, which means we're a tad short on time.
Guys, look.
We know the box Ryan's in is green.
It's gotta be around here, so I need you to...
Yeah.
So we should shout out if we see a box that looks like the ones over there.
It hasn't left yet!
We can make it!
- Let's go!
- Hold on, Larry!
- Which way now?
- Yeah, which way?
Run!
No!
No!
Ryan's on that thing!
We've got to stop it!
- We can't, Sam!
- I don't care!
- No, Sammy, you'll drown!
- Sam!
I failed.
Again.
I only count one failure.
It's big, but it's just one.
Goodbye, Ryan.
We're gonna miss ya.
- Samson!
- What on earth is going on?
It's a human and I do not think he works for the zoo.
Perhaps now is a good time to improvise.
What?
Great!
One problem down...
Far out.
Cool.
One disaster to go.
What are you doing?
We're headed for the other boat!
How do we steer?
Who knows how to steer?
None of us.
We're animals.
Great!
- Hold on, Larry.
Do that again.
- Do what?
Whatever you just did, but the opposite!
But I don't know my opposites!
No, Larry, like this!
I think I've got it.
Well, that was easy.
Oh, dear.
Has anyone got any eucalyptus wipes?
This isn't so difficult.
I'm the lion of the sea!
Well done, sir.
Captain of our team and now captain of this vessel.
You're brilliant.
I hate to be Miss Negative, but in this melee, we seem to have lost Ryan's boat.
- What, nothing?
- Nothing.
He's gone.
No.
There!
Nelson!
The green boxes!
- You're sure, eh?
- And there's my buddies!
And my love!
Let's go in!
- We'll head away from the sun.
- No, towards the sun.
To the north.
Starboard...
Leftboard.
Just follow my finger.
Please.
You guys wouldn't know the answer if it fell from the sky and hit you in the head.
Oh, my!
It's a bat!
It's a bat!
Get it off me!
Get it off me!
- Benny!
- Benny?
Geese!
- Are you all right?
- Yes, my princess.
Benny, you made it!
You're my best friend.
Best friends should stick together.
Even not-so-best friends, who knock you off a speeding garbage truck.
Excuse me, but I begged them to go back and get you.
Just so you know.
Benny, could you see Ryan's boat from up there?
Well, it just so happens I saw it heading that way.
And we're in luck!
- How's it goin', eh?
- Canadian geese!
Experts at intercontinental travel.
Hey, birdie, OK, is it true that Canada has lax immigration policies for koalas?
I'll take it from here.
My son's out there.
We really need your help.
Can you lead us to that boat?
No problem, eh?
Just follow us and Bob's your uncle.
Try not to lag too far behind, eh?
Hey, Benny, thanks.
And FYI, Bridget was very concerned when you fell off the truck.
Bet you didn't know I could ride geese, did you?
- Bareback.
- Oh, brother.
Sammy?
We going to the wild now?
I think we are, Larry.
I can't take it anymore.
He's taunting us!
Listen!
Stop laughing at us, you solar twit!
Captain Bligh, sir!
Are the ice cream cones ready?
The crew, they're on the verge of mutiny.
Nigel, please.
If you don't give us ice creams pretty quick, you're gonna walk the plank, sir!
- Nigel.
- I don't care if I drown,
I'm getting off this death cruise right now.
Iceberg!
Permission to go down with the ship, sir.
Hang on!
Stuff that!
Run!
Swim!
Nigel?
Look, I'm a starfish.
Guys, look.
Gosh.
Must feel like a lifetime since you've been here.
Yeah... a lifetime.
What the heck?
Wow!
Look!
They're releasing the green boxes back into the wild.
- Larry.
- Guys, they're putting animals inside the green boxes.
I just can't figure out why.
It's a tunnel to another dimension, can't you see?
- They go in...
- Who is this guy?
It's all right, Nigel.
Think it has anything to do with that?
Hang on a second.
Either I'm starving or Larry is making sense.
You're right.
Those animals are being rescued.
Ryan?
Ryan!
Oh, no!
Ryan!
We've got to move fast!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Where are you, buddy?
Ryan!
- I can't believe it!
- Samson!
I was so close.
He was right there!
- We'll never find him now!
- Come here!
Will you get a hold of yourself?
Use your instincts.
I don't want to run anymore.
Good. 'Cause frankly, you need a good sports bra.
- Ryan?
- Everything's under control.
- Temporary setback.
- I got it.
- I got Ryan's scent!
- He got it?
I mean, he got it!
Let's go!
- Hooray!
- Wait for us!
I'm not designed for this!
I want a car.
Hey, guys, I found him!
Ryan!
Doesn't anyone knock anymore?
Where's my son?
Did he come through here?
Yeah, now that I think about it, he did come through here.
Hello?
Come on out, baby lion!
Your dad's here!
Well, what do you know?
There's a whole pride of lions here!
Funky.
I was under the impression you had Ryan's scent, not this olfactory insult.
I...
I had Ryan's scent, but my predator instincts must've kicked in since, you know, I haven't eaten for a while.
Exactly!
You never know when those instincts are gonna kick in.
Excellent.
Fantastic!
We get to see the legend in action.
I'd love to, but we just don't have time.
We got the time, Sammy.
Just...
And then you do this.
And then this bit.
Rip him apart!
The horror.
I can't bear to watch!
But I have to.
Go on.
Get out of here.
- The legend dropped his dinner.
- Oh, boy.
What's wrong?
I'm not good enough for you to eat?
No.
It's just I'm allergic to nuts.
Now I get it.
You're gonna toy with me?
Beat me up a little, then pounce when I get my hopes up?
How exciting.
Come on, guys.
Ryan can't be far.
Hey!
I'm not finished with you!
I am a delicacy.
My flesh has fruity wood notes!
Watch it, you little hors d'oeuvre.
That's Samson the Wild.
You call this wild?
This is a cat!
A big, fat, tame pussycat!
- OK, that's enough!
- The pussycat hissed at me!
Maybe I should hide behind the koala for protection.
While we're at it, could you slap me in the face?
No.
What are you, a twit?
- Ignore him.
- Don't bother!
I'm leaving.
- You're weird.
- Run for your lives!
It's a lion with moral issues!
And I've had it with you too!
Thanks a lot for wrecking my day!
Teensy question.
Or more like a...
a sort of a query meets a statement.
That hyrax back there?
It was sort of like you couldn't eat him.
Yeah, and what about those dogs?
There was no munching there, either.
If I didn't know any better, I'd say that you're...
- A vegetarian?
- Nope.
- That's not what I was going to say.
- You were going to say...
- It's almost like...
- You're not from...
The wild?
Well, you're right.
I'm not from the wild.
What?
I'm just a phony.
Truth is I can't protect you out here.
Please just go back to the boat.
I've got to find my son.
Tell me we're not in a dangerous jungle with an 8-inch squirrel protecting us.
Actually, I'm nine inches, but other than that, yes.
So that means...
We are going to die!
Hey, guys!
Guys!
Will the three of you calm down?
How could he lie to us?
- We're his best friends.
- Sure.
Maybe he lied 'cause he didn't want to tell us the truth.
OK, yeah, whatever.
Whatever.
Let's just go back to the boat, then.
The fierce, the proud, the wild...
Rubbish!
But wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait!
Where you goin'?
Stop right there!
Stop!
Bridget, if you go, I'm...
I'm breaking up with you.
We were never going out in the first place.
Then we're taking a break.
- Nigel!
- All right!
Hey, listen!
I know you're scared.
But at least we got each other.
Sammy's got nobody.
He's out there all alone.
And... so is Ryan.
OK, OK, focus, Samson.
He's got to be out there somewhere.
You'll find him.
I mean, how big can this place be, anyway?
Ryan!
Hey there, little fella.
You're lost too, huh?
You remind me of my buddy back home.
A bloodthirsty monster!
Where?
Where?
He's a killer!
Get away from my baby!
Calm down, lady!
Won't anyone save my baby?
Bye-bye.
Ryan!
Ryan!
Sammy!
I wasn't meant for the wild.
I was made to nibble and be elegant and to appear in children's books as the letter G.
Come on, this isn't scary, is it?
It's just leaves and vines and...
Oh, that's my foot.
Nigel, keep a lookout back there.
- You too, Larry!
- Okeydokey.
Oh, I see.
All right, OK, yeah.
You're giving me the silent treatment.
Like I care.
Nigel!
I gave you an order.
Would a little "Sir, yes, sir!" kill ya?
Nigel.
That's not funny, Nigel.
- He's gone!
We're doomed.
- Nigel!
First Ryan, then Samson, and now Nigel!
I do believe in zoos.
- Larry, you're tensing up!
- I do, I do, I do.
- Don't panic.
I'm in charge.
- That's why we're panicking!
I say we fan out and circle.
What are we, peacocks?
We don't fan, we run.
Run for your lives, everybody!
Guys, I've got an idea.
Why don't we ask them?
It's OK...
They, you see, they got hooves.
That means they don't hunt.
They graze.
But they're licking their chops.
I'll take the one with the funny knees.
The funny knee...?
Benny, no!
Benny?
Get them.
Just, hey, back off.
I'm sorry,
I'm not that kind of koala bear.
Right.
Excuse me?
Hello?
Terribly sorry to bother you, but do you speak koala?
Sprechen Sie koala?
Right.
Could you possibly not go towards the big smoking thing?
G'day, mate G'day, mate
G'day, mate G'day, mate
G'day, mate G'day, mate
What a strange place for a party.
Very good, very organized.
Can I use your toilet?
I'm having a
Really nice day Really nice day
Really nice day
I'm having a
Really nice day Really nice day
Really nice day
- Why don't you all
- Tickle away, tickle away
They're frighteningly horrible monster beasts but they're not bad dancers.
I'm so cuddly I like you
I'm so cuddly I like you
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
- I'm having a
- Really nice day
Oh, no!
Tickle away Tickle away
I'm so cuddly, I like you Good day
- What is that?
- I am Kazar.
Leader.
Prophet.
Choreographer.
And with your help... carnivore!
No!
Don't kill me!
I've had such a weird life!
This is not fair.
Oh, I get it.
A yoga retreat.
Ryan!
You can do this.
Use your instincts.
Follow your instincts.
Use your instincts.
OK.
Down this way.
This way.
A lion cub.
We must tell Kazar.
- It's my turn to tell him.
- You got to last time.
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!
Thank you very much, but I'm afraid I've got to run.
Koalas are very busy bees.
If I could...
I'll just buzz along to the door...
For centuries, we've watched our brethren perish at the claw of the lion.
Today, we put our hooves down.
No longer will we dwell at the bottom of the food chain.
Well, yes.
I should say so.
There were those who doubted that you'd arrive to lead us.
But I always believed in the Omen.
The Omen!
Right.
Remind me again?
Sent down by the gods years ago...
Oh, no!
Not you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
Oh, Great Him, you must lead us in our transformation from prey to predator.
Hold it.
I am the Great Him?
- The Great Him?
- Him.
So this is all your fault!
That's it!
You...!
- Kazar!
- Kazar!
Don't listen to him!
- Kazar!
Over here!
- Kazar!
Over here!
How dare you interrupt my audience with the Great Him!
But... but we found a lion cub!
- You did?
- Was he with a big lion?
With big hair?
Well, a mullet, really.
Oh, Great Him, you brought two lions with you?
Well, like any Great Him,
I travel with an entourage.
Worry not, Your Himness, I shall have Blag bring the lions here.
And he better not screw this up, like you screwed up my dance number!
I lost count for one verse.
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
Why do we even bother rehearsing?
A good chorus line is so hard to put together.
Take to the skies!
We're taking!
We're taking!
- Find them!
- Yes, sir.
Bring us those lions!
The gods celebrate the fulfillment of the prophecy.
We stamp our hooves in praise of the Great Him!
Holy moly!
Holy moly Holy moly
You are our king!
Looky, looky who's there.
Surprise!
No!
Sorry we're late for dinner!
That's pathetic!
Get off!
- That didn't hurt!
- Stop!
- Ryan!
- No!
I'm coming, son!
Dad?
- Help!
- Let's scram!
- Ryan!
- What are you doing here?
- I can't believe it!
I found you.
- How'd you find me?
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
- Your paw.
- I got trapped in that box.
It's OK, son.
And then I escaped, and I ran into the jungle then those vultures came and tried to kill me.
You wouldn't have been scared.
I was.
- I have to tell you something.
- What?
Listen.
- Get 'em, Dad!
- Run!
Run!
Dad, you should be chasing them!
- Like you used to!
- Those were just stories!
But now's your chance to show me for real!
This way!
- Dad?
What's goin' on?
- Just get up into that tree!
- I think we lost them.
- What's the deal?
They're just a bunch of wimpy donkeys!
You could kick their rumps!
- Ryan, I can't fight them.
- You donkey-chickens!
Get back here!
Ryan!
I can't fight them.
What do you mean?
I was young still just a cub.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Children of all ages.
Samson!
Swallow that fear and stand tall!
Witness the greatest day in our young lion's life!
The day he discovers his roar!
Dad, I can't do it!
Now, go!
Listen as Samson unleashes a roar so mighty, it launches a wildebeest clear off the savannah!
Samson!
Dig deep!
I should have known.
If you'd been born in the wild, you'd know how to roar.
Dad?
Dad!
Dad!
Please!
Dad.
When they shipped me to the zoo, I never wanted anyone to know where I came from.
Especially those closest to me.
I should have told you sooner.
But... all those stories you tell?
I'm so sorry, Ryan.
Everything you told me was a lie?
- Dad!
- Hang on, son.
Help!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Run!
Not so fast, Tigger.
Dad!
Ryan!
Dad!
- Help!
- Ryan.
Help!
Dad!
- Ryan.
- Dad!
Help me!
What?
Wait!
What?
What?
Wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Get off me!
What is goin' on here?
- Stinky does not speak.
- It rolls like a little ball.
Wait.
You guys think I'm a...?
- Achtung, Stinky!
- Less talk, more roll.
- Ja.
- Roll!
Roll!
What the...?
Hey!
Rolling the dung is good for tight buns!
I'll give you something to roll about!
It's a good thing Bridget didn't see that!
Bridget?
Larry!
They're gone.
I gotta find them!
No!
I gotta find Samson first!
No!
First...
Sam.
Sam!
Bridget!
Larry!
Oh, Ryan!
You're alive!
Good to see you guys.
- Where's my hug?
- Larry.
- There it is.
- It's good to see you too.
What are you guys doing here?
We came here with your father to find you.
And he's probably out there right now lookin' for us.
I wish he were.
But some of these wildebeests pushed him off a cliff.
- What?
- What?
I don't think he made it.
I don't see how he could.
Oh, Ryan.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Kazar, I think you'll be very pleased with what I brought you.
What's this?
Where's the other lion?
Right.
Well, I was gonna tell you, there was this cliff and...
Why are you looking at me like that?
That's twice you've been out of step today, Blag!
You klutz.
You know we can't ascend to the top of the food chain until we eat a lion!
Well, at least there'll be enough for my ascension.
What about the rest of us?
Step-kick, pivot-kick!
Ouch!
I twisted a hoof!
You work and you work.
Then they break your heart.
- There goes my career!
- Prepare the sacrifices!
Why did I let him go off by himself?
He couldn't catch a cold, much less his own lunch.
Bet I could catch you.
Please.
My natural predator is fuel inject...
What?
I knew you weren't really gone.
I knew it!
Come on, I knew it!
We're still buddies, right?
I lost Ryan.
There were too many.
They just took him.
Who?
Who took him?
- Wildebeests.
- The freaks with the hooves!
They got Larry and Bridget too.
Couldn't fight, couldn't...
Come on, Sam.
You're a lion.
You come from a long line of kings.
Yeah, maybe you're not from the wild.
But fighting's in your blood!
No.
I'll never be a real lion.
Wrong!
You are a real lion.
Doesn't matter where you're from:
Zoo, jungle, goldfish bowl.
It's what's in here.
That determines who you are!
At least, that's what you always told your son.
Now he's out there, Sammy, and he needs you.
Who else is gonna teach him how to roar?
That's it, Sammy.
That's it.
Let's go find my son...
and my friends.
Yeah!
Nothing's gonna stop us!
Except that we have no idea where we're going!
Follow your instincts.
Follow your instincts.
- What is that?
- My... instincts?
- Benny?
- You're almost there.
That settles it, then.
My mother definitely drank pool water when she was pregnant with me.
Benny, look.
The freaks with hooves!
Ryan's in there.
You can't just barge in.
That's suicide!
- Benny, get out of my way!
- Don't listen to the rat.
- Hey, who are you calling a rat?
- You, of course.
- You'll give away our position.
- I'll have you written up for that!
Fool!
You blew our cover!
Men!
Scatter!
Not so fast!
Look who I got, Sammy.
It's your lion instincts.
Who are you guys?
- Our names aren't important.
- I'm Cloak.
He's Camo.
- We're covert agents.
- Why have you been leading me around?
- That's classified.
- Top-secret.
- The wildebeests have gone mad.
- Cloak.
It's not like I told them our plan is to use them to defeat Kazar's...
Listen, just tell me, did they take my son in there?
- That's need-to-know.
- They did.
- They think the koala's a god.
- You're the worst covert agent!
Oh, yeah?
Then why can I do this?
Men!
Hey!
No!
Stop!
Sammy!
- Idiot!
That maneuver's confidential.
- It's secret.
This one's confidential.
- Cloak!
- And this one's restricted.
Super-secret.
Top-secret.
This is ultra-secret!
Enough!
No more!
Show 'em the super-top-secret "no more?" Gotcha!
No!
I got an idea.
Who is this Great Him, anyway?
I'll take him on.
I'm the Great Her!
I'll show Him a thing or two.
I'm from New York City, for Pete's sake.
Oh, my.
You have got to be kidding me.
Nigel, I don't know what you're trying to pull,
- but I will kick your...
- Silence!
Why, you little...
Silence, again!
You do not speak to me!
Nigel, what's the deal?
Great Him, shall we prepare the feast?
Yes, we shall!
What's on the menu?
Them.
Oh, no.
Eat friends and be god, don't eat friends...
God, friends, god, friends.
God, I...
Well, that was subtle.
Prepare the meat fire!
Wait!
We cannot cook them without onion!
Onions.
Onions.
Onions.
Well, that was fast.
Let the ritual begin.
Move it!
I am so mad at you!
Wait!
We also need... hats!
Do we not have the party hats of death?
I've got mine!
And before the feast, we must all...
What the...?
...levitate and spin uncontrollably!
And feel a bit sick.
How do I stop this thing?
- Guys.
- Benny?
- Look, a squirrel!
- Larry!
We've got a plan.
Follow me.
- We?
- I can fly!
Oh, Great Him, we are humbled by your power.
Be humbled.
Only the Great Him can do this!
- Volcanic gas!
- Our cover's blown!
Major malfunction!
Abandon ship!
- Oh, boy.
- Well, about time you got here.
Great Him, it's another miracle!
You've delivered us a real lion!
Blag, your luck has turned.
Thanks to the Great Him, we shall all ascend tonight.
Nigel, we've got to create a distraction.
Hang on a sec!
I've got miracles comin' out my ears!
Ready?
Stand back as the Great Me attacks the lion over 73 times my size!
Dad?
My dad's alive!
Guys, my dad made it!
- Ryan, no!
- Hurry, I got to see him!
Whack, whack, whack!
- Dad!
- What?
Ryan!
- I planned this.
- Ryan, no!
At long last, the cosmic balance has shifted.
- Stay close.
- Prey has become predator!
And predator has become prey!
And the hoof finally trumps the claw!
Come on, Dad!
Let's show these turkey-jerkies who's at the top of the food chain!
Let's eat the brat first.
Over my dead body!
Yeah.
Dad!
He's gonna kill Samson if we don't do something!
Why don't we use the secret play?
I know.
Shut up, Larry.
That's stupid.
No!
It's brilliant!
They laughed at me when I spoke of the Omen.
But look who's laughing now!
Little to the left.
Yeah.
No!
Little to the right!
Next floor:
Bottom of the food chain!
Ding!
Fire!
We gotta find something bigger!
I know where we can find something bigger.
- Ready, Ryan?
- Dig deep!
You should have stayed at home.
Now our shrine will become your tomb.
Fire!
Ryan!
Ryan!
I don't typically eat dessert before the main course!
Get away from my son!
Ryan.
Ryan, are you still with me?
It's OK, Dad.
I just want you to know
I'm sorry you didn't have a father like the one I have.
Ryan.
How touching.
But then, last words usually are.
Finish them.
What are you doing?
I command you to attack them, like true predators!
We're tired of pretending to be something we're not.
But most of all, we're tired of you.
Blag.
Fine.
I'll kill them myself!
Dad, remember what you always told me in your stories:
Dig deep.
Oh, yeah, baby!
Let's go.
Yeah.
- Come on, let's get out of here!
- Get out of here!
And for the record, I've always hated your choreography.
It's so... '80s.
That's right!
Run!
Run like the cowardly prey that you are!
I will hunt you down!
Everyone!
To the boat!
Top of the food chain, Ma!
Top of the food chain...
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
Hurry!
We're never gonna make it!
Push, you crazy, hairy monsters!
Push!
- Larry, throw it in reverse!
- Reverse throwing!
At least I saw the wild before it disappeared.
I can still see it.
It's right...
Here.
I found my roar.
We both did, son.
You know, Dad, this'll be our first story of Samson and Ryan the Wild.
I don't think anybody's gonna believe it.
Incoming!
I'm so cuddly!
Cuddly!
I'm so cuddly!
I know you're cuddly.
But can you float?
- I'm having a
- Really nice day
Really nice day Really nice day
Step-kick left!
Really nice day
Step-kick right!
- Splendid.
- No!
Smashing.
Hey!
- Stupendous!
- Are you guys sure about this?
Operation Snake-Over is now complete.
Hey, look, everyone!
I'm a secret agent!
Bridget, I get it.
You're more than a tall, lanky goddess.
You're a strong, independent female.
You don't need to be defined by your relationship
- and I, I respect that.
- It's about time.
What was that?
Just your daily dose of vitamin Bridget, baby.
Oh, yeah yeah!
Really nice day Really nice day
Look out!
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
Yes!
Did y'all see that?
Check this!
Go, Blag!
Go, Blag!
Go, Blag!
Hey, Blag.
- No parking' on the dance floor.
- Parkin'?
Dad?
Make some room there, big guy!
Really nice day Really, really nice day
Yeah!
Pretty crazy, right?
Pretty wild!
Well, technically, it...
It's awesome.
Yes, right.
- I was just gonna say that.
- Come on!
Everyone!
This is gonna be a long ride home.
I'm havin' a
Really nice day Really nice day, really nice day
- I'm having a
- I'm so cuddly, I like you
G'day
What are you doing this for?
What, do you think it's funny?
Just get out.
Sorry about that, everybody.
Sorry.
Hello.
Do carry on.
Come on!
All right, everybody exit in an orderly...
All right, single file!
Keep it...
I seem to do a lot of falling and screaming in this adventure.
So there I was, face to face with the biggest, meanest leopard on this side of the Serengeti.
And...
You roared so loud, his spots flew clean off.
Dad, I've heard this like a billion times.
Do you know the one where I made the laughing hyenas...
Cry?
Yep.
- The croc attack?
- Dad.
OK.
Think.
Yeah, you do that.
All right, Mr. Smart Guy, here's one I know you haven't heard.
It all started in the little place I like to call the wild.
They were the fastest wildebeests on the savannah.
We're talking fast.
All the other lions had given up the hunt hours ago, except your old man.
Fortunately, I knew a short cut.
I thought I had 'em.
Until the dust cleared.
Classic wildebeest trap.
So, what did you do next?
- What did I do?
- Yeah.
That's when I gave them the roar.
- That's it?
- Hold on a sec.
I only thought it was over.
But they had a secret weapon.
He was the biggest wildebeest I've ever seen.
- He was 14 feet tall!
- Fourteen?
I meant 1,401 feet tall!
Cool.
And he had two...
No, four of the biggest horns I'd ever seen.
- Whoa!
- His breath was red hot!
I mean, green.
And he hated the environment.
To pull this off, I knew I was gonna have to dig deep, deeper than I ever had before.
So I swallowed my fear, sucked in the biggest breath I could.
Dad, I'm ready!
- You got it?
- I got it!
- I got it!
- Well, let him have it!
Roar, son!
Story of my life.
Your roar stops a herd of wildebeests.
Mine makes the babies laugh.
Hey, come on.
That was much better.
I'm serious!
It dropped half an octave.
It dropped half an octave.
And it sure scared me.
- Made my hair stand up on end.
- Yeah, right, Dad.
- OK.
Let's take it from the top.
- I'm done for today.
Come on, come on, one more.
You were so close.
Maybe it's something technical.
Maybe you're not opening your mouth wide enough.
Like this.
Dad, thanks for the technical help, but if you wanted me to roar like you, you'd take me to the wild.
Hold on a second.
We've got everything we could ever want here.
Great lifestyle, three squares a day.
- It's boring.
- Boring?
- I'll never learn how to roar here.
- Ryan.
But don't worry.
I finally figured out
- how we can get to the wild.
- You did?
The pigeons say those green boxes go there.
Those boxes are bad news.
Stay away.
- But, Dad...
- I know you're frustrated,
- but a lion finds his roar...
- Here.
I'm so tired of hearing that, Dad!
It's a rat!
Get that rat off my baby!
A rat?
Hello!
Silly, silly rat.
- Rats do not got bling like this, lady.
- You little...!
Lastly, that is the ugliest baby I've ever seen!
Benny, stealing candy from a baby?
Stealing is such a strong word.
I prefer "liberating."
Hey, kid, heard the roar.
Down another...
- Octave.
- Octave!
You ready to cheer me and your old man as we capture our fifth straight turtle-curling title?
I can't even roar.
How would you even know I'm there?
So, you really think it dropped an octave?
Absolutely.
- What the heck is an octave?
- I heard that.
- Rabbit.
- Cholesterol.
I'll stick with the nuts.
I don't know what his problem is, Benny.
He's 11, but he's still roaring at a nine-year-old level.
Little help here, Sammy?
You know what?
Maybe you're setting the bar too high, with all those stories about Samson the Wild.
Hey, he's always loved those stories!
They inspire him.
OK.
I'm not gonna argue with someone who can use my tail as dental floss.
- You got something right there.
- Where?
- No, no, other side.
- Here?
- Sorry, Benny.
- You got it.
Attention, friends.
Stop by the gift shop and get the most popular plush in America:
Nigel, the "l-Like-You" Koala.
- Look, honey!
The crazy thing talks!
- I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
That's right.
He's so cuddly.
And better yet, he likes you.
Finally.
And the zoo will officially be ours in T-minus three two and showtime!
Here I come!
Who put that bar there?
That tickles!
- Did too!
- Did not!
- Did too!
- Did not!
Out of my way, ya bum!
There's that moth-eaten koala!
I've told you flamingos a hundred times, walk.
- How about an autograph?
!
- Don't...
Birds!
Find the string on his back!
- So you're havin' a really nice day!
- Guys.
Off my co-captain, now.
Sorry, Samson.
That didn't hurt.
I almost forgot to tell you.
I'm gonna ask Bridget out finally.
Slow down, Romeo.
You are a squirrel and she is...
Perfect, right?
Look, I know what you're sayin'.
Believe me, I got my eyes wide open.
Watch where you're goin', you big...!
Bridget.
Don't stare at my spots, Benny.
My eyes are up here.
Of course.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, this is for you, honey.
It goes around your left hoof.
Did you get that out of the trash?
You did!
You trash-picker!
I'm not a trash-picker.
I'm a recycler.
That's a lot more romantic.
Isn't it?
- Romantic?
- Sam, come here.
Romantic?
Don't mention romance to me, Benny.
- I've never had a boyfriend.
- That settles it.
I accept the job...
of boyfriend number one.
Benny, only the female orb-weaver spider will date a male one-twentieth her size.
- So there's hope!
- And then she eats him.
But at least he dies happy.
Let's get Ryan, dude!
Dude!
We said that at the same time!
Dude.
Hey!
Hey, Ryan.
Listen, I'm headin' down to the game.
I'm gonna see you there, right?
Come on, Ryan.
We need you.
You're our biggest fan.
Yo, Samson!
I'm your number one fan, man!
Thanks, man.
Right back at ya!
You were saying, Dad?
Listen.
About this afternoon, I was just trying...
Dad, fine.
I'll go to your game, all right?
OK.
I'II... see you there, then.
Come on, dude.
- Dude.
- Guess who's here?
Eze.
Duke.
Man, he always guesses.
We're gonna stalk the gazelles while everybody's at the game.
- You in?
- Let's go, bro!
The Ryanator.
I'm comin' down.
Fish heads!
Get your ice-cold fish heads!
Now eyeball-free!
We're into the final period of the curling championships and the penguins are up.
Here comes Victor.
What a beauty!
Yeah, sweep!
Heading straight for the bull's-eye!
This could be it, folks!
- Bo-wango!
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah!
- That's gonna be tough to beat.
What? "Tough to beat"?
That's just the way we like it, right, guys?
I can't believe this!
If we lose, I'm gonna rip my head off!
And yours!
We cannot lose to flightless birds!
Whoa, whoa.
No one is losing anything around here.
As long as we stay focused.
- By the way, has anyone seen Ryan?
- Oh!
I know!
Maybe he's sulking 'cause he lives in his father's shadow and he roars like a schoolgirl.
- Thanks, Lar.
- You betcha!
Nigel!
Nigel!
Will you sign my dolly?
- Not again.
- Nigel, ignore them.
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
- You're so cuddly!
We love you!
- That's it!
I am not cuddly!
I'm a vicious jungle animal from the streets of London!
- Fear me!
- Get him!
Get him!
Get him!
- Help me!
- Girls!
Put him down.
I am not a doll!
- Cushy tushy!
- Leave my bum alone!
Nigel!
Get your paws off my girlfriend!
Benny, I am not your girlfriend!
Really nice day!
What is up with Samson's team tonight?
Brutal!
Benny?
Oh, my gosh!
Who knows mouth-to-mouth?
I do!
What was that?
Just your daily dose of vitamin Benny, baby.
- Get off my nose.
- I'm so cuddly, I like you!
- Stop saying that!
- G'day, mate!
Cannonball!
Next year, I should just coach.
Check it.
The Thomson gazelle.
Zero to 50 in four-point-five seconds.
- The ultimate fleeing machine.
- There is no substitute.
Let's get a closer look at these slim jims.
- Shall we?
- I think we shall.
Maybe we should just go to the game.
- I thought you wanted to be wild.
- Your dad chased gazelles.
Yeah, if he were our age, he would so be rockin' out with us.
He'd be in there, runnin' 'em down like they were...
- Gazelles.
- Yeah, gazelles or somethin'.
Ready, man?
We'd better not.
Oh, yeah?
Are you gonna stop us?
- Guys, guys.
- Here we go!
The whole series comes down to this throw!
There's no tomorrow!
It's do or die!
Ya know what I mean.
Guys, I know we're down, but we're gonna pull this out 'cause we're gonna use the secret play.
- The secret play!
Hey, everybody, guess what?
We're gonna use the secret play!
Larry, the first part of the secret play is keeping it secret.
- OK.
- Follow my lead.
I'm going to need a double effort from everybody.
Absolutely, captain.
Triple effort if you want, sir.
- Good.
Ready, and...
- Break!
Quiet.
On three, dude.
One, two...
No!
Now you did it, Ryan.
Feelin' mean, Donald?
Bring it on!
Folks, there's pressure on the big guy!
- Ready, Bridget?
- Ready.
- Ready, Benny?
- Ready!
Samson, it's a shame your little brat isn't here to see you lose.
I can't... hold it!
Oh, no!
What are you doin'?
And here comes Samson.
Look at that guy.
Is he a beauty or what?
Larry!
Bridget!
Sweep!
What a recovery!
He's sendin' in Bridget and Larry to do the job!
Sweep faster, Larry!
Sweep, sweep!
- I am!
- Come on, man!
Team Penguin is sending their ace, Victor...
- Watch it, Victor!
- Watch it yourself, see?
Nigel, how are we looking?
- This could be trouble, folks!
- Sweep, sweep, sweep.
This is cheating and you will die for this.
I can't hear you, Nigel.
Move left a bit...
OK.
Move left and hit!
- Larry, no!
- Tallyho!
What a move!
Folks, we are inches away from the greatest upset in turtle-curling history!
- Oh, no!
I can't believe my eyes!
- No!
Looks like Samson might have choked!
- Nice!
- Yes!
Unbelievable!
Samson and his team have clinched the title!
- No, wait!
I've called it too soon!
- What the heck?
The penguins have done it!
They're zoo champs for the first time!
Stampede?
Stampede!
Please!
Stop!
Watch out!
Dude.
Busted.
Catastrophic.
Told you I'd come to the game.
You think this is funny?
You just endangered everyone in the zoo!
- I'm sorry.
- For what?
Chasing the gazelles or costing us the game?
All you do is sit up in your tree and sulk.
- If you just...
- What's the problem?
Is all this because you can't roar?
Ryan, I didn't mean that.
Know what I'm doing when I'm sulking in my tree?
I'm thinking how great it would be if Samson the Wild wasn't my father.
Ryan, I didn't...
'Cause it would make being Ryan the Lame a lot easier.
Ryan, I'm sorry.
Ryan!
Please don't leave.
Bye, Ryan!
Thanks for coming to the game.
And you were worried he wouldn't show up.
Not good.
No one listens to the squirrel.
I don't know what to do anymore, Benny.
- I've tried everything.
- Everything?
- You tried everything?
- What are you saying?
I'm saying you have to tell him the truth.
I don't think I could do that, Benny.
I mean...
What's he gonna think of me when he finds out?
I don't know.
But if you don't tell him you're gonna lose him, Sammy.
The green boxes.
OK, they're all loaded up!
- You don't think I know that?
- Get movin'!
I changed my mind!
I don't wanna go!
Help!
Ryan.
Help me!
Watch out!
Sam!
- Wait for us!
- Dad!
- Ryan!
- Dad!
Don't let them take me!
- No!
- Ryan!
Help!
- No!
- Dad!
Help me!
Ryan!
- Benny, we need that truck followed.
- Check.
Get me... the pigeons.
I am wanting snake eyes!
Come on, baby.
Come on, just throw it.
Thanks.
Hamir!
You are the great loser of all time!
What offerings must I make, I wonder?
Hamir!
Hamir!
Get a grip on yourself!
Benny!
I am needing till Friday before I am paying you back!
No, no.
It's Ryan.
He's in one of those green boxes and they took it away!
We've got to find him!
That is not good!
Not good at all!
I know!
I know!
I am telling him, you crazy pigeon!
The green boxes go to the big water where stiff lady with spikes on her head...
- Hamir?
I can't understand...
- Spikes!
Just tell me where the green boxes go.
Stiff lady, spikies?
Yes, like my wife says, the truck takes them to her!
To her!
Though I hate telling bad news, there is more bad news to tell.
When the sun rises, the green boxes leave on boat-boat and never return!
I am sorry for this.
I really am.
Hello?
No.
Not good.
Not good.
You always say that.
I keep on sayin' it.
No one's listenin'.
Like a broken record here.
OK.
When do we leave, Sammy?
Yeah, when do we leave?
It's not "we." It's me.
Let's make this clear.
This is now a rescue mission and I am the only one going.
We'll come too!
We're not afraid.
Are we, guys?
Afraid?
No.
You know koalas.
More like "scared of things."
Ryan's like a cub to all of us.
Not that I'll ever have one of my own at this rate.
You know, there's that famous...
A koala once said,
"We will fight them... with peaches."
Yeah.
Anyway.
- So we're helping, whatever it takes.
- You want to leave with me?
OK.
If you don't mind being hunted down, shot at stuffed...
- OK!
...or worse, then fine.
I have a recurring nightmare about taxidermy and spot remover.
Well, they have to catch us before they can stuff us and I'm fast.
Nobody's leaving but me.
Got it?
- You're the boss.
- You bet.
- You got the big hair.
- Absolutely.
Yeah, that's good, Sammy.
Hey, way to weed out the weak links.
Now that they're out of the picture, what's the plan?
Don't worry about a thing, big guy.
I got it all taken care of.
I know this city like the back of my paw.
We ditch this truck at Fifth Avenue, couple lefts, couple rights, bada-boom, past Broadway and...
You're there!
What are you doing here?
- What?
- We're going to help you find Ryan!
She said, "We're gonna help you find Ryan."
- Oh, great.
- Hey, guys.
I've got popcorn up my bum.
Do I look trashy in this?
OK, here's my...
Here's my overall plan.
Where are we going?
I only have until sunrise before Ryan is taken away forever!
And now I have to worry about you three?
All right, fine.
When do we get off of this thing, Benny?
Benny's here?
Yeah, he's right there.
Benny?
Benny!
Great.
Now what am I gonna do?
Guys!
Guys!
I think we should duck!
What is she saying?
She said, "Duck down!"
Duck!
I am not in the mood for a game of footsie or hoofsie or pawsie or...
That wasn't my paw.
It was this!
I didn't steal it.
I borrowed it.
It'll light the way to Ryan.
The walls are moving.
Right, right.
The walls...
The walls are moving!
Larry, hold your breath!
Larry, stay straight!
Everybody out!
All right, don't panic.
What we've got to do...
This is definitely not good.
Samson!
- Give me your hoof!
- Help!
Larry!
The garbage!
It lives!
Guys?
OK, anybody?
I'm freakin' out.
- What's the hold up?
- Hello?
We're over here, Nigel.
Right.
I'll be there in a minute.
Think.
What did Benny say?
Couple of lefts, couple of rights.
Bridget, can you see the green lady?
I'm looking, I'm looking, but I can't see over anything for a change.
How far are you away?
You in a different continent?
Is that you, Larry?
Up here, Nige.
You're a very furry snake.
Guys...
We don't want to draw attention to ourselves.
Dogs.
This should be fun for you, Samson.
Nigel!
Grab Bridget!
- What?
- Run!
I'm gonna throw up!
I'm gonna throw up!
Shouldn't you be tearing them to shreds?
All part of the plan.
This maneuver's known as the Serengeti Slip.
Page ten of the Predator's Playbook.
What next?
Page 11?
Go on, you mutts!
Stupid dogs, we could've taken you.
Taken you to a...
To a disco!
Larry, improvise!
- Larry, that's not helping.
- OK.
You dogs think you got bark?
Well, Samson's got roar!
- Show 'em, Sam.
- Dig deep, Samson.
You're a lion.
Be a lion.
Look at that guy!
Sam, they are frothing at the mouth.
OK...
- Larry, coil!
- Check!
- Sam!
- I improvised.
Now jump!
- Down there?
- Yes!
We're leaving, Larry!
Teensy question, Samson.
With those dogs up there, why didn't you just do what you did in the wild?
You know, lionize 'em or lionate them or lionify them?
I don't have time to fight dogs, Bridget.
We have to find Ryan, remember?
What is this stinky place?
It appears to be a human bathing area.
You mean humans don't lick themselves clean?
Disgusting!
They're hopeless.
It is hard to believe they are at the top of the food chain.
I can't imagine beginning the day without licking myself.
No hurry, but is there a plan?
Of course there's a plan.
We follow this water to the big water, and then we find the lady with...
Larry, either your stomach is growling or something in it is growling.
Wasn't me.
What?
- Smooth move, Nigel!
- Oh, boy!
Twins!
OK, Sammy, hurry it up now, 'cause these guys are seeming to have acid reflux or something!
Everybody... stay calm.
- Calm?
- Not good.
Yo.
Boo!
I'm gonna say, it looks like you and your crew here are a little far from your borough.
Far from your borough!
I love it.
We're going to the big water.
Nigel, show them what we're looking for.
- Like this?
- I think it's in her right hand.
- And isn't she blue?
- I can't do blue.
- No idea.
You?
- Doesn't even register.
- You're batting' zero, kid.
- Do the thing with...
Make your bloody mind up.
The big female with the spikes on her melon!
They're tourists.
All right, tourists, listen up.
Ya gotta get to Battery Park.
First take the Broadway culvert.
- Down the Broadway culvert?
- What's wrong with that?
- They get lost at the sewage plant!
- Get outta here!
- What are you talking about?
- How would you send 'em?
You're sendin' 'em the wrong way!
The Wall Street culvert is blocked with construction.
- That is true.
- All right.
Guys, you gonna help or not?
Yeah, sure.
Of course we're gonna help ya's.
We're one big family, right?
Except for that guy there.
He scares the...
You done runnin' your mouth yet, Carmine?
Are ya?
I apologize.
He never got over being flushed down the toilet.
Yeah.
Follow me, 'cause you four won't last ten minutes in this neighborhood.
It's a jungle down here.
- Stan, you know who that is?
- What?
No.
That's one of them talkin' kawana bears!
How ya doing?
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I've seen a lot of those things floating' here in the sewer.
That's good!
You're makin' me laugh over here.
Just wait for me!
Are we in the right place?
Any place without two hilarious alligators seems a move in the right direction.
- Sam, do you see anything up there?
- I sure do.
Well, well, well.
There she is, like Hamir said.
And it's sunrise, which means we're a tad short on time.
Guys, look.
We know the box Ryan's in is green.
It's gotta be around here, so I need you to...
Yeah.
So we should shout out if we see a box that looks like the ones over there.
It hasn't left yet!
We can make it!
- Let's go!
- Hold on, Larry!
- Which way now?
- Yeah, which way?
Run!
No!
No!
Ryan's on that thing!
We've got to stop it!
- We can't, Sam!
- I don't care!
- No, Sammy, you'll drown!
- Sam!
I failed.
Again.
I only count one failure.
It's big, but it's just one.
Goodbye, Ryan.
We're gonna miss ya.
- Samson!
- What on earth is going on?
It's a human and I do not think he works for the zoo.
Perhaps now is a good time to improvise.
What?
Great!
One problem down...
Far out.
Cool.
One disaster to go.
What are you doing?
We're headed for the other boat!
How do we steer?
Who knows how to steer?
None of us.
We're animals.
Great!
- Hold on, Larry.
Do that again.
- Do what?
Whatever you just did, but the opposite!
But I don't know my opposites!
No, Larry, like this!
I think I've got it.
Well, that was easy.
Oh, dear.
Has anyone got any eucalyptus wipes?
This isn't so difficult.
I'm the lion of the sea!
Well done, sir.
Captain of our team and now captain of this vessel.
You're brilliant.
I hate to be Miss Negative, but in this melee, we seem to have lost Ryan's boat.
- What, nothing?
- Nothing.
He's gone.
No.
There!
Nelson!
The green boxes!
- You're sure, eh?
- And there's my buddies!
And my love!
Let's go in!
- We'll head away from the sun.
- No, towards the sun.
To the north.
Starboard...
Leftboard.
Just follow my finger.
Please.
You guys wouldn't know the answer if it fell from the sky and hit you in the head.
Oh, my!
It's a bat!
It's a bat!
Get it off me!
Get it off me!
- Benny!
- Benny?
Geese!
- Are you all right?
- Yes, my princess.
Benny, you made it!
You're my best friend.
Best friends should stick together.
Even not-so-best friends, who knock you off a speeding garbage truck.
Excuse me, but I begged them to go back and get you.
Just so you know.
Benny, could you see Ryan's boat from up there?
Well, it just so happens I saw it heading that way.
And we're in luck!
- How's it goin', eh?
- Canadian geese!
Experts at intercontinental travel.
Hey, birdie, OK, is it true that Canada has lax immigration policies for koalas?
I'll take it from here.
My son's out there.
We really need your help.
Can you lead us to that boat?
No problem, eh?
Just follow us and Bob's your uncle.
Try not to lag too far behind, eh?
Hey, Benny, thanks.
And FYI, Bridget was very concerned when you fell off the truck.
Bet you didn't know I could ride geese, did you?
- Bareback.
- Oh, brother.
Sammy?
We going to the wild now?
I think we are, Larry.
I can't take it anymore.
He's taunting us!
Listen!
Stop laughing at us, you solar twit!
Captain Bligh, sir!
Are the ice cream cones ready?
The crew, they're on the verge of mutiny.
Nigel, please.
If you don't give us ice creams pretty quick, you're gonna walk the plank, sir!
- Nigel.
- I don't care if I drown,
I'm getting off this death cruise right now.
Iceberg!
Permission to go down with the ship, sir.
Hang on!
Stuff that!
Run!
Swim!
Nigel?
Look, I'm a starfish.
Guys, look.
Gosh.
Must feel like a lifetime since you've been here.
Yeah... a lifetime.
What the heck?
Wow!
Look!
They're releasing the green boxes back into the wild.
- Larry.
- Guys, they're putting animals inside the green boxes.
I just can't figure out why.
It's a tunnel to another dimension, can't you see?
- They go in...
- Who is this guy?
It's all right, Nigel.
Think it has anything to do with that?
Hang on a second.
Either I'm starving or Larry is making sense.
You're right.
Those animals are being rescued.
Ryan?
Ryan!
Oh, no!
Ryan!
We've got to move fast!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Where are you, buddy?
Ryan!
- I can't believe it!
- Samson!
I was so close.
He was right there!
- We'll never find him now!
- Come here!
Will you get a hold of yourself?
Use your instincts.
I don't want to run anymore.
Good. 'Cause frankly, you need a good sports bra.
- Ryan?
- Everything's under control.
- Temporary setback.
- I got it.
- I got Ryan's scent!
- He got it?
I mean, he got it!
Let's go!
- Hooray!
- Wait for us!
I'm not designed for this!
I want a car.
Hey, guys, I found him!
Ryan!
Doesn't anyone knock anymore?
Where's my son?
Did he come through here?
Yeah, now that I think about it, he did come through here.
Hello?
Come on out, baby lion!
Your dad's here!
Well, what do you know?
There's a whole pride of lions here!
Funky.
I was under the impression you had Ryan's scent, not this olfactory insult.
I...
I had Ryan's scent, but my predator instincts must've kicked in since, you know, I haven't eaten for a while.
Exactly!
You never know when those instincts are gonna kick in.
Excellent.
Fantastic!
We get to see the legend in action.
I'd love to, but we just don't have time.
We got the time, Sammy.
Just...
And then you do this.
And then this bit.
Rip him apart!
The horror.
I can't bear to watch!
But I have to.
Go on.
Get out of here.
- The legend dropped his dinner.
- Oh, boy.
What's wrong?
I'm not good enough for you to eat?
No.
It's just I'm allergic to nuts.
Now I get it.
You're gonna toy with me?
Beat me up a little, then pounce when I get my hopes up?
How exciting.
Come on, guys.
Ryan can't be far.
Hey!
I'm not finished with you!
I am a delicacy.
My flesh has fruity wood notes!
Watch it, you little hors d'oeuvre.
That's Samson the Wild.
You call this wild?
This is a cat!
A big, fat, tame pussycat!
- OK, that's enough!
- The pussycat hissed at me!
Maybe I should hide behind the koala for protection.
While we're at it, could you slap me in the face?
No.
What are you, a twit?
- Ignore him.
- Don't bother!
I'm leaving.
- You're weird.
- Run for your lives!
It's a lion with moral issues!
And I've had it with you too!
Thanks a lot for wrecking my day!
Teensy question.
Or more like a...
a sort of a query meets a statement.
That hyrax back there?
It was sort of like you couldn't eat him.
Yeah, and what about those dogs?
There was no munching there, either.
If I didn't know any better, I'd say that you're...
- A vegetarian?
- Nope.
- That's not what I was going to say.
- You were going to say...
- It's almost like...
- You're not from...
The wild?
Well, you're right.
I'm not from the wild.
What?
I'm just a phony.
Truth is I can't protect you out here.
Please just go back to the boat.
I've got to find my son.
Tell me we're not in a dangerous jungle with an 8-inch squirrel protecting us.
Actually, I'm nine inches, but other than that, yes.
So that means...
We are going to die!
Hey, guys!
Guys!
Will the three of you calm down?
How could he lie to us?
- We're his best friends.
- Sure.
Maybe he lied 'cause he didn't want to tell us the truth.
OK, yeah, whatever.
Whatever.
Let's just go back to the boat, then.
The fierce, the proud, the wild...
Rubbish!
But wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait!
Where you goin'?
Stop right there!
Stop!
Bridget, if you go, I'm...
I'm breaking up with you.
We were never going out in the first place.
Then we're taking a break.
- Nigel!
- All right!
Hey, listen!
I know you're scared.
But at least we got each other.
Sammy's got nobody.
He's out there all alone.
And... so is Ryan.
OK, OK, focus, Samson.
He's got to be out there somewhere.
You'll find him.
I mean, how big can this place be, anyway?
Ryan!
Hey there, little fella.
You're lost too, huh?
You remind me of my buddy back home.
A bloodthirsty monster!
Where?
Where?
He's a killer!
Get away from my baby!
Calm down, lady!
Won't anyone save my baby?
Bye-bye.
Ryan!
Ryan!
Sammy!
I wasn't meant for the wild.
I was made to nibble and be elegant and to appear in children's books as the letter G.
Come on, this isn't scary, is it?
It's just leaves and vines and...
Oh, that's my foot.
Nigel, keep a lookout back there.
- You too, Larry!
- Okeydokey.
Oh, I see.
All right, OK, yeah.
You're giving me the silent treatment.
Like I care.
Nigel!
I gave you an order.
Would a little "Sir, yes, sir!" kill ya?
Nigel.
That's not funny, Nigel.
- He's gone!
We're doomed.
- Nigel!
First Ryan, then Samson, and now Nigel!
I do believe in zoos.
- Larry, you're tensing up!
- I do, I do, I do.
- Don't panic.
I'm in charge.
- That's why we're panicking!
I say we fan out and circle.
What are we, peacocks?
We don't fan, we run.
Run for your lives, everybody!
Guys, I've got an idea.
Why don't we ask them?
It's OK...
They, you see, they got hooves.
That means they don't hunt.
They graze.
But they're licking their chops.
I'll take the one with the funny knees.
The funny knee...?
Benny, no!
Benny?
Get them.
Just, hey, back off.
I'm sorry,
I'm not that kind of koala bear.
Right.
Excuse me?
Hello?
Terribly sorry to bother you, but do you speak koala?
Sprechen Sie koala?
Right.
Could you possibly not go towards the big smoking thing?
G'day, mate G'day, mate
G'day, mate G'day, mate
G'day, mate G'day, mate
What a strange place for a party.
Very good, very organized.
Can I use your toilet?
I'm having a
Really nice day Really nice day
Really nice day
I'm having a
Really nice day Really nice day
Really nice day
- Why don't you all
- Tickle away, tickle away
They're frighteningly horrible monster beasts but they're not bad dancers.
I'm so cuddly I like you
I'm so cuddly I like you
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
- I'm having a
- Really nice day
Oh, no!
Tickle away Tickle away
I'm so cuddly, I like you Good day
- What is that?
- I am Kazar.
Leader.
Prophet.
Choreographer.
And with your help... carnivore!
No!
Don't kill me!
I've had such a weird life!
This is not fair.
Oh, I get it.
A yoga retreat.
Ryan!
You can do this.
Use your instincts.
Follow your instincts.
Use your instincts.
OK.
Down this way.
This way.
A lion cub.
We must tell Kazar.
- It's my turn to tell him.
- You got to last time.
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!
Thank you very much, but I'm afraid I've got to run.
Koalas are very busy bees.
If I could...
I'll just buzz along to the door...
For centuries, we've watched our brethren perish at the claw of the lion.
Today, we put our hooves down.
No longer will we dwell at the bottom of the food chain.
Well, yes.
I should say so.
There were those who doubted that you'd arrive to lead us.
But I always believed in the Omen.
The Omen!
Right.
Remind me again?
Sent down by the gods years ago...
Oh, no!
Not you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
Oh, Great Him, you must lead us in our transformation from prey to predator.
Hold it.
I am the Great Him?
- The Great Him?
- Him.
So this is all your fault!
That's it!
You...!
- Kazar!
- Kazar!
Don't listen to him!
- Kazar!
Over here!
- Kazar!
Over here!
How dare you interrupt my audience with the Great Him!
But... but we found a lion cub!
- You did?
- Was he with a big lion?
With big hair?
Well, a mullet, really.
Oh, Great Him, you brought two lions with you?
Well, like any Great Him,
I travel with an entourage.
Worry not, Your Himness, I shall have Blag bring the lions here.
And he better not screw this up, like you screwed up my dance number!
I lost count for one verse.
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
Why do we even bother rehearsing?
A good chorus line is so hard to put together.
Take to the skies!
We're taking!
We're taking!
- Find them!
- Yes, sir.
Bring us those lions!
The gods celebrate the fulfillment of the prophecy.
We stamp our hooves in praise of the Great Him!
Holy moly!
Holy moly Holy moly
You are our king!
Looky, looky who's there.
Surprise!
No!
Sorry we're late for dinner!
That's pathetic!
Get off!
- That didn't hurt!
- Stop!
- Ryan!
- No!
I'm coming, son!
Dad?
- Help!
- Let's scram!
- Ryan!
- What are you doing here?
- I can't believe it!
I found you.
- How'd you find me?
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
- Your paw.
- I got trapped in that box.
It's OK, son.
And then I escaped, and I ran into the jungle then those vultures came and tried to kill me.
You wouldn't have been scared.
I was.
- I have to tell you something.
- What?
Listen.
- Get 'em, Dad!
- Run!
Run!
Dad, you should be chasing them!
- Like you used to!
- Those were just stories!
But now's your chance to show me for real!
This way!
- Dad?
What's goin' on?
- Just get up into that tree!
- I think we lost them.
- What's the deal?
They're just a bunch of wimpy donkeys!
You could kick their rumps!
- Ryan, I can't fight them.
- You donkey-chickens!
Get back here!
Ryan!
I can't fight them.
What do you mean?
I was young still just a cub.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Children of all ages.
Samson!
Swallow that fear and stand tall!
Witness the greatest day in our young lion's life!
The day he discovers his roar!
Dad, I can't do it!
Now, go!
Listen as Samson unleashes a roar so mighty, it launches a wildebeest clear off the savannah!
Samson!
Dig deep!
I should have known.
If you'd been born in the wild, you'd know how to roar.
Dad?
Dad!
Dad!
Please!
Dad.
When they shipped me to the zoo, I never wanted anyone to know where I came from.
Especially those closest to me.
I should have told you sooner.
But... all those stories you tell?
I'm so sorry, Ryan.
Everything you told me was a lie?
- Dad!
- Hang on, son.
Help!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Run!
Not so fast, Tigger.
Dad!
Ryan!
Dad!
- Help!
- Ryan.
Help!
Dad!
- Ryan.
- Dad!
Help me!
What?
Wait!
What?
What?
Wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Get off me!
What is goin' on here?
- Stinky does not speak.
- It rolls like a little ball.
Wait.
You guys think I'm a...?
- Achtung, Stinky!
- Less talk, more roll.
- Ja.
- Roll!
Roll!
What the...?
Hey!
Rolling the dung is good for tight buns!
I'll give you something to roll about!
It's a good thing Bridget didn't see that!
Bridget?
Larry!
They're gone.
I gotta find them!
No!
I gotta find Samson first!
No!
First...
Sam.
Sam!
Bridget!
Larry!
Oh, Ryan!
You're alive!
Good to see you guys.
- Where's my hug?
- Larry.
- There it is.
- It's good to see you too.
What are you guys doing here?
We came here with your father to find you.
And he's probably out there right now lookin' for us.
I wish he were.
But some of these wildebeests pushed him off a cliff.
- What?
- What?
I don't think he made it.
I don't see how he could.
Oh, Ryan.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Kazar, I think you'll be very pleased with what I brought you.
What's this?
Where's the other lion?
Right.
Well, I was gonna tell you, there was this cliff and...
Why are you looking at me like that?
That's twice you've been out of step today, Blag!
You klutz.
You know we can't ascend to the top of the food chain until we eat a lion!
Well, at least there'll be enough for my ascension.
What about the rest of us?
Step-kick, pivot-kick!
Ouch!
I twisted a hoof!
You work and you work.
Then they break your heart.
- There goes my career!
- Prepare the sacrifices!
Why did I let him go off by himself?
He couldn't catch a cold, much less his own lunch.
Bet I could catch you.
Please.
My natural predator is fuel inject...
What?
I knew you weren't really gone.
I knew it!
Come on, I knew it!
We're still buddies, right?
I lost Ryan.
There were too many.
They just took him.
Who?
Who took him?
- Wildebeests.
- The freaks with the hooves!
They got Larry and Bridget too.
Couldn't fight, couldn't...
Come on, Sam.
You're a lion.
You come from a long line of kings.
Yeah, maybe you're not from the wild.
But fighting's in your blood!
No.
I'll never be a real lion.
Wrong!
You are a real lion.
Doesn't matter where you're from:
Zoo, jungle, goldfish bowl.
It's what's in here.
That determines who you are!
At least, that's what you always told your son.
Now he's out there, Sammy, and he needs you.
Who else is gonna teach him how to roar?
That's it, Sammy.
That's it.
Let's go find my son...
and my friends.
Yeah!
Nothing's gonna stop us!
Except that we have no idea where we're going!
Follow your instincts.
Follow your instincts.
- What is that?
- My... instincts?
- Benny?
- You're almost there.
That settles it, then.
My mother definitely drank pool water when she was pregnant with me.
Benny, look.
The freaks with hooves!
Ryan's in there.
You can't just barge in.
That's suicide!
- Benny, get out of my way!
- Don't listen to the rat.
- Hey, who are you calling a rat?
- You, of course.
- You'll give away our position.
- I'll have you written up for that!
Fool!
You blew our cover!
Men!
Scatter!
Not so fast!
Look who I got, Sammy.
It's your lion instincts.
Who are you guys?
- Our names aren't important.
- I'm Cloak.
He's Camo.
- We're covert agents.
- Why have you been leading me around?
- That's classified.
- Top-secret.
- The wildebeests have gone mad.
- Cloak.
It's not like I told them our plan is to use them to defeat Kazar's...
Listen, just tell me, did they take my son in there?
- That's need-to-know.
- They did.
- They think the koala's a god.
- You're the worst covert agent!
Oh, yeah?
Then why can I do this?
Men!
Hey!
No!
Stop!
Sammy!
- Idiot!
That maneuver's confidential.
- It's secret.
This one's confidential.
- Cloak!
- And this one's restricted.
Super-secret.
Top-secret.
This is ultra-secret!
Enough!
No more!
Show 'em the super-top-secret "no more?" Gotcha!
No!
I got an idea.
Who is this Great Him, anyway?
I'll take him on.
I'm the Great Her!
I'll show Him a thing or two.
I'm from New York City, for Pete's sake.
Oh, my.
You have got to be kidding me.
Nigel, I don't know what you're trying to pull,
- but I will kick your...
- Silence!
Why, you little...
Silence, again!
You do not speak to me!
Nigel, what's the deal?
Great Him, shall we prepare the feast?
Yes, we shall!
What's on the menu?
Them.
Oh, no.
Eat friends and be god, don't eat friends...
God, friends, god, friends.
God, I...
Well, that was subtle.
Prepare the meat fire!
Wait!
We cannot cook them without onion!
Onions.
Onions.
Onions.
Well, that was fast.
Let the ritual begin.
Move it!
I am so mad at you!
Wait!
We also need... hats!
Do we not have the party hats of death?
I've got mine!
And before the feast, we must all...
What the...?
...levitate and spin uncontrollably!
And feel a bit sick.
How do I stop this thing?
- Guys.
- Benny?
- Look, a squirrel!
- Larry!
We've got a plan.
Follow me.
- We?
- I can fly!
Oh, Great Him, we are humbled by your power.
Be humbled.
Only the Great Him can do this!
- Volcanic gas!
- Our cover's blown!
Major malfunction!
Abandon ship!
- Oh, boy.
- Well, about time you got here.
Great Him, it's another miracle!
You've delivered us a real lion!
Blag, your luck has turned.
Thanks to the Great Him, we shall all ascend tonight.
Nigel, we've got to create a distraction.
Hang on a sec!
I've got miracles comin' out my ears!
Ready?
Stand back as the Great Me attacks the lion over 73 times my size!
Dad?
My dad's alive!
Guys, my dad made it!
- Ryan, no!
- Hurry, I got to see him!
Whack, whack, whack!
- Dad!
- What?
Ryan!
- I planned this.
- Ryan, no!
At long last, the cosmic balance has shifted.
- Stay close.
- Prey has become predator!
And predator has become prey!
And the hoof finally trumps the claw!
Come on, Dad!
Let's show these turkey-jerkies who's at the top of the food chain!
Let's eat the brat first.
Over my dead body!
Yeah.
Dad!
He's gonna kill Samson if we don't do something!
Why don't we use the secret play?
I know.
Shut up, Larry.
That's stupid.
No!
It's brilliant!
They laughed at me when I spoke of the Omen.
But look who's laughing now!
Little to the left.
Yeah.
No!
Little to the right!
Next floor:
Bottom of the food chain!
Ding!
Fire!
We gotta find something bigger!
I know where we can find something bigger.
- Ready, Ryan?
- Dig deep!
You should have stayed at home.
Now our shrine will become your tomb.
Fire!
Ryan!
Ryan!
I don't typically eat dessert before the main course!
Get away from my son!
Ryan.
Ryan, are you still with me?
It's OK, Dad.
I just want you to know
I'm sorry you didn't have a father like the one I have.
Ryan.
How touching.
But then, last words usually are.
Finish them.
What are you doing?
I command you to attack them, like true predators!
We're tired of pretending to be something we're not.
But most of all, we're tired of you.
Blag.
Fine.
I'll kill them myself!
Dad, remember what you always told me in your stories:
Dig deep.
Oh, yeah, baby!
Let's go.
Yeah.
- Come on, let's get out of here!
- Get out of here!
And for the record, I've always hated your choreography.
It's so... '80s.
That's right!
Run!
Run like the cowardly prey that you are!
I will hunt you down!
Everyone!
To the boat!
Top of the food chain, Ma!
Top of the food chain...
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
Hurry!
We're never gonna make it!
Push, you crazy, hairy monsters!
Push!
- Larry, throw it in reverse!
- Reverse throwing!
At least I saw the wild before it disappeared.
I can still see it.
It's right...
Here.
I found my roar.
We both did, son.
You know, Dad, this'll be our first story of Samson and Ryan the Wild.
I don't think anybody's gonna believe it.
Incoming!
I'm so cuddly!
Cuddly!
I'm so cuddly!
I know you're cuddly.
But can you float?
- I'm having a
- Really nice day
Really nice day Really nice day
Step-kick left!
Really nice day
Step-kick right!
- Splendid.
- No!
Smashing.
Hey!
- Stupendous!
- Are you guys sure about this?
Operation Snake-Over is now complete.
Hey, look, everyone!
I'm a secret agent!
Bridget, I get it.
You're more than a tall, lanky goddess.
You're a strong, independent female.
You don't need to be defined by your relationship
- and I, I respect that.
- It's about time.
What was that?
Just your daily dose of vitamin Bridget, baby.
Oh, yeah yeah!
Really nice day Really nice day
Look out!
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
Yes!
Did y'all see that?
Check this!
Go, Blag!
Go, Blag!
Go, Blag!
Hey, Blag.
- No parking' on the dance floor.
- Parkin'?
Dad?
Make some room there, big guy!
Really nice day Really, really nice day
Yeah!
Pretty crazy, right?
Pretty wild!
Well, technically, it...
It's awesome.
Yes, right.
- I was just gonna say that.
- Come on!
Everyone!
This is gonna be a long ride home.
I'm havin' a
Really nice day Really nice day, really nice day
- I'm having a
- I'm so cuddly, I like you
G'day
What are you doing this for?
What, do you think it's funny?
Just get out.
Sorry about that, everybody.
Sorry.
Hello.
Do carry on.
Come on!
All right, everybody exit in an orderly...
All right, single file!
Keep it...
I seem to do a lot of falling and screaming in this adventure.
THE END Subtitles by:
Reklame11
So there I was, face to face with the biggest, meanest leopard on this side of the Serengeti.
And...
You roared so loud, his spots flew clean off.
Dad, I've heard this like a billion times.
Do you know the one where I made the laughing hyenas...
Cry?
Yep.
- The croc attack?
- Dad.
OK.
Think.
Yeah, you do that.
All right, Mr. Smart Guy, here's one I know you haven't heard.
It all started in the little place I like to call the wild.
They were the fastest wildebeests on the savannah.
We're talking fast.
All the other lions had given up the hunt hours ago, except your old man.
Fortunately, I knew a short cut.
I thought I had 'em.
Until the dust cleared.
Classic wildebeest trap.
So, what did you do next?
- What did I do?
- Yeah.
That's when I gave them the roar.
- That's it?
- Hold on a sec.
I only thought it was over.
But they had a secret weapon.
He was the biggest wildebeest I've ever seen.
- He was 14 feet tall!
- Fourteen?
I meant 1,401 feet tall!
Cool.
And he had two...
No, four of the biggest horns I'd ever seen.
- Whoa!
- His breath was red hot!
I mean, green.
And he hated the environment.
To pull this off, I knew I was gonna have to dig deep, deeper than I ever had before.
So I swallowed my fear, sucked in the biggest breath I could.
Dad, I'm ready!
- You got it?
- I got it!
- I got it!
- Well, let him have it!
Roar, son!
Story of my life.
Your roar stops a herd of wildebeests.
Mine makes the babies laugh.
Hey, come on.
That was much better.
I'm serious!
It dropped half an octave.
It dropped half an octave.
And it sure scared me.
- Made my hair stand up on end.
- Yeah, right, Dad.
- OK.
Let's take it from the top.
- I'm done for today.
Come on, come on, one more.
You were so close.
Maybe it's something technical.
Maybe you're not opening your mouth wide enough.
Like this.
Dad, thanks for the technical help, but if you wanted me to roar like you, you'd take me to the wild.
Hold on a second.
We've got everything we could ever want here.
Great lifestyle, three squares a day.
- It's boring.
- Boring?
- I'll never learn how to roar here.
- Ryan.
But don't worry.
I finally figured out
- how we can get to the wild.
- You did?
The pigeons say those green boxes go there.
Those boxes are bad news.
Stay away.
- But, Dad...
- I know you're frustrated,
- but a lion finds his roar...
- Here.
I'm so tired of hearing that, Dad!
It's a rat!
Get that rat off my baby!
A rat?
Hello!
Silly, silly rat.
- Rats do not got bling like this, lady.
- You little...!
Lastly, that is the ugliest baby I've ever seen!
Benny, stealing candy from a baby?
Stealing is such a strong word.
I prefer "liberating."
Hey, kid, heard the roar.
Down another...
- Octave.
- Octave!
You ready to cheer me and your old man as we capture our fifth straight turtle-curling title?
I can't even roar.
How would you even know I'm there?
So, you really think it dropped an octave?
Absolutely.
- What the heck is an octave?
- I heard that.
- Rabbit.
- Cholesterol.
I'll stick with the nuts.
I don't know what his problem is, Benny.
He's 11, but he's still roaring at a nine-year-old level.
Little help here, Sammy?
You know what?
Maybe you're setting the bar too high, with all those stories about Samson the Wild.
Hey, he's always loved those stories!
They inspire him.
OK.
I'm not gonna argue with someone who can use my tail as dental floss.
- You got something right there.
- Where?
- No, no, other side.
- Here?
- Sorry, Benny.
- You got it.
Attention, friends.
Stop by the gift shop and get the most popular plush in America:
Nigel, the "I-Like-You" Koala.
- Look, honey!
The crazy thing talks!
- I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
That's right.
He's so cuddly.
And better yet, he likes you.
Finally.
And the zoo will officially be ours in T-minus three two and showtime!
Here I come!
Who put that bar there?
That tickles!
- Did too!
- Did not!
- Did too!
- Did not!
Out of my way, ya bum!
There's that moth-eaten koala!
I've told you flamingos a hundred times, walk.
- How about an autograph?
!
- Don't...
Birds!
Find the string on his back!
- So you're havin' a really nice day!
- Guys.
Off my co-captain, now.
Sorry, Samson.
That didn't hurt.
I almost forgot to tell you.
I'm gonna ask Bridget out finally.
Slow down, Romeo.
You are a squirrel and she is...
Perfect, right?
Look, I know what you're sayin'.
Believe me, I got my eyes wide open.
Watch where you're goin', you big...!
Bridget.
Don't stare at my spots, Benny.
My eyes are up here.
Of course.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, this is for you, honey.
It goes around your left hoof.
Did you get that out of the trash?
You did!
You trash-picker!
I'm not a trash-picker.
I'm a recycler.
That's a lot more romantic.
Isn't it?
- Romantic?
- Sam, come here.
Romantic?
Don't mention romance to me, Benny.
- I've never had a boyfriend.
- That settles it.
I accept the job...
of boyfriend number one.
Benny, only the female orb-weaver spider will date a male one-twentieth her size.
- So there's hope!
- And then she eats him.
But at least he dies happy.
Let's get Ryan, dude!
Dude!
We said that at the same time!
Dude.
Hey!
Hey, Ryan.
Listen, I'm headin' down to the game.
I'm gonna see you there, right?
Come on, Ryan.
We need you.
You're our biggest fan.
Yo, Samson!
I'm your number one fan, man!
Thanks, man.
Right back at ya!
You were saying, Dad?
Listen.
About this afternoon, I was just trying...
Dad, fine.
I'll go to your game, all right?
OK.
I'll... see you there, then.
Come on, dude.
- Dude.
- Guess who's here?
Eze.
Duke.
Man, he always guesses.
We're gonna stalk the gazelles while everybody's at the game.
- You in?
- Let's go, bro!
The Ryanator.
I'm comin' down.
Fish heads!
Get your ice-cold fish heads!
Now eyeball-free!
We're into the final period of the curling championships and the penguins are up.
Here comes Victor.
What a beauty!
Yeah, sweep!
Heading straight for the bull's-eye!
This could be it, folks!
- Bo-wango!
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah!
- That's gonna be tough to beat.
What? "Tough to beat"?
That's just the way we like it, right, guys?
I can't believe this!
If we lose, I'm gonna rip my head off!
And yours!
We cannot lose to flightless birds!
Whoa, whoa.
No one is losing anything around here.
As long as we stay focused.
- By the way, has anyone seen Ryan?
- Oh!
I know!
Maybe he's sulking 'cause he lives in his father's shadow and he roars like a schoolgirl.
- Thanks, Lar.
- You betcha!
Nigel!
Nigel!
Will you sign my dolly?
- Not again.
- Nigel, ignore them.
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
- You're so cuddly!
We love you!
- That's it!
I am not cuddly!
I'm a vicious jungle animal from the streets of London!
- Fear me!
- Get him!
Get him!
Get him!
- Help me!
- Girls!
Put him down.
I am not a doll!
- Cushy tushy!
- Leave my bum alone!
Nigel!
Get your paws off my girlfriend!
Benny, I am not your girlfriend!
Really nice day!
What is up with Samson's team tonight?
Brutal!
Benny?
Oh, my gosh!
Who knows mouth-to-mouth?
I do!
What was that?
Just your daily dose of vitamin Benny, baby.
- Get off my nose.
- I'm so cuddly, I like you!
- Stop saying that!
- G'day, mate!
Cannonball!
Next year, I should just coach.
Check it.
The Thomson gazelle.
Zero to 50 in four-point-five seconds.
- The ultimate fleeing machine.
- There is no substitute.
Let's get a closer look at these slim jims.
- Shall we?
- I think we shall.
Maybe we should just go to the game.
- I thought you wanted to be wild.
- Your dad chased gazelles.
Yeah, if he were our age, he would so be rockin' out with us.
He'd be in there, runnin' 'em down like they were...
- Gazelles.
- Yeah, gazelles or somethin'.
Ready, man?
We'd better not.
Oh, yeah?
Are you gonna stop us?
- Guys, guys.
- Here we go!
The whole series comes down to this throw!
There's no tomorrow!
It's do or die!
Ya know what I mean.
Guys, I know we're down, but we're gonna pull this out 'cause we're gonna use...
- ...the secret play.
- The secret play!
Hey, everybody, guess what?
We're gonna use the secret play!
Larry, the first part of the secret play is keeping it secret.
- OK.
- Follow my lead.
I'm going to need a double effort from everybody.
Absolutely, captain.
Triple effort if you want, sir.
- Good.
Ready, and...
- Break!
Quiet.
On three, dude.
One, two...
No!
Now you did it, Ryan.
Feelin' mean, Donald?
Bring it on!
Folks, there's pressure on the big guy!
- Ready, Bridget?
- Ready.
- Ready, Benny?
- Ready!
Samson, it's a shame your little brat isn't here to see you lose.
I can't... hold it!
Oh, no!
What are you doin'?
And here comes Samson.
Look at that guy.
Is he a beauty or what?
Larry!
Bridget!
Sweep!
What a recovery!
He's sendin' in Bridget and Larry to do the job!
Sweep faster, Larry!
Sweep, sweep!
- I am!
- Come on, man!
Team Penguin is sending their ace, Victor...
- Watch it, Victor!
- Watch it yourself, see?
Nigel, how are we looking?
- This could be trouble, folks!
- Sweep, sweep, sweep.
This is cheating and you will die for this.
I can't hear you, Nigel.
Move left a bit...
OK.
Move left and hit!
- Larry, no!
- Tallyho!
What a move!
Folks, we are inches away from the greatest upset in turtle-curling history!
- Oh, no!
I can't believe my eyes!
- No!
Looks like Samson might have choked!
- Nice!
- Yes!
Unbelievable!
Samson and his team have clinched the title!
- No, wait!
I've called it too soon!
- What the heck?
The penguins have done it!
They're zoo champs for the first time!
Stampede?
Stampede!
Please!
Stop!
Watch out!
Dude.
Busted.
Catastrophic.
Told you I'd come to the game.
You think this is funny?
You just endangered everyone in the zoo!
- I'm sorry.
- For what?
Chasing the gazelles or costing us the game?
All you do is sit up in your tree and sulk.
- If you just...
- What's the problem?
Is all this because you can't roar?
Ryan, I didn't mean that.
Know what I'm doing when I'm sulking in my tree?
I'm thinking how great it would be if Samson the Wild wasn't my father.
Ryan, I didn't...
'Cause it would make being Ryan the Lame a lot easier.
Ryan, I'm sorry.
Ryan!
Please don't leave.
Bye, Ryan!
Thanks for coming to the game.
And you were worried he wouldn't show up.
Not good.
No one listens to the squirrel.
I don't know what to do anymore, Benny.
- I've tried everything.
- Everything?
- You tried everything?
- What are you saying?
I'm saying you have to tell him the truth.
I don't think I could do that, Benny.
I mean...
What's he gonna think of me when he finds out?
I don't know.
But if you don't tell him you're gonna lose him, Sammy.
The green boxes.
OK, they're all loaded up!
- You don't think I know that?
- Get movin'!
I changed my mind!
I don't wanna go!
Help!
Ryan.
Help me!
Watch out!
Sam!
- Wait for us!
- Dad!
- Ryan!
- Dad!
Don't let them take me!
- No!
- Ryan!
Help!
- No!
- Dad!
Help me!
Ryan!
- Benny, we need that truck followed.
- Check.
Get me... the pigeons.
I am wanting snake eyes!
Come on, baby.
Come on, just throw it.
Thanks.
Hamir!
You are the great loser of all time!
What offerings must I make, I wonder?
Hamir!
Hamir!
Get a grip on yourself!
Benny!
I am needing till Friday before I am paying you back!
No, no.
It's Ryan.
He's in one of those green boxes and they took it away!
We've got to find him!
That is not good!
Not good at all!
I know!
I know!
I am telling him, you crazy pigeon!
The green boxes go to the big water where stiff lady with spikes on her head...
- Hamir?
I can't understand...
- Spikes!
Just tell me where the green boxes go.
Stiff lady, spikies?
Yes, like my wife says, the truck takes them to her!
To her!
Though I hate telling bad news, there is more bad news to tell.
When the sun rises, the green boxes leave on boat-boat and never return!
I am sorry for this.
I really am.
Hello?
No.
Not good.
Not good.
You always say that.
I keep on sayin' it.
No one's listenin'.
Like a broken record here.
OK.
When do we leave, Sammy?
Yeah, when do we leave?
It's not "we".
It's me.
Let's make this clear.
This is now a rescue mission and I am the only one going.
We'll come too!
We're not afraid.
Are we, guys?
Afraid?
No.
You know koalas.
More like "scared of things."
Ryan's like a cub to all of us.
Not that I'll ever have one of my own at this rate.
You know, there's that famous...
A koala once said,
"We will fight them... with peaches."
Yeah.
Anyway.
- So we're helping, whatever it takes.
- You want to leave with me?
OK.
If you don't mind being hunted down, shot at...
- ...stuffed...
- OK!
...or worse, then fine.
I have a recurring nightmare about taxidermy and spot remover.
Well, they have to catch us before they can stuff us and I'm fast.
Nobody's leaving but me.
Got it?
- You're the boss.
- You bet.
- You got the big hair.
- Absolutely.
Yeah, that's good, Sammy.
Hey, way to weed out the weak links.
Now that they're out of the picture, what's the plan?
Don't worry about a thing, big guy.
I got it all taken care of.
I know this city like the back of my paw.
We ditch this truck at Fifth Avenue, couple lefts, couple rights, bada-boom, past Broadway and...
You're there!
What are you doing here?
- What?
- We're going to help you find Ryan!
She said, "We're gonna help you find Ryan."
- Oh, great.
- Hey, guys.
I've got popcorn up my bum.
Do I look trashy in this?
OK, here's my...
Here's my overall plan.
Where are we going?
I only have until sunrise before Ryan is taken away forever!
And now I have to worry about you three?
All right, fine.
When do we get off of this thing, Benny?
Benny's here?
Yeah, he's right there.
Benny?
Benny!
Great.
Now what am I gonna do?
Guys!
Guys!
I think we should duck!
What is she saying?
She said, "Duck down!"
Duck!
I am not in the mood for a game of footsie or hoofsie or pawsie or...
That wasn't my paw.
It was this!
I didn't steal it.
I borrowed it.
It'll light the way to Ryan.
The walls are moving.
Right, right.
The walls...
The walls are moving!
Larry, hold your breath!
Larry, stay straight!
Everybody out!
All right, don't panic.
What we've got to do...
This is definitely not good.
Samson!
- Give me your hoof!
- Help!
Larry!
The garbage!
It lives!
Guys?
OK, anybody?
I'm freakin' out.
- What's the hold up?
- Hello?
We're over here, Nigel.
Right.
I'll be there in a minute.
Think.
What did Benny say?
Couple of lefts, couple of rights.
Bridget, can you see the green lady?
I'm looking, I'm looking, but I can't see over anything for a change.
How far are you away?
You in a different continent?
Is that you, Larry?
Up here, Nige.
You're a very furry snake.
Guys...
We don't want to draw attention to ourselves.
Dogs.
This should be fun for you, Samson.
Nigel!
Grab Bridget!
- What?
- Run!
I'm gonna throw up!
I'm gonna throw up!
Shouldn't you be tearing them to shreds?
All part of the plan.
This maneuver's known as the Serengeti Slip.
Page ten of the Predator's Playbook.
What next?
Page 11?
Go on, you mutts!
Stupid dogs, we could've taken you.
Taken you to a...
To a disco!
Larry, improvise!
- Larry, that's not helping.
- OK.
You dogs think you got bark?
Well, Samson's got roar!
- Show 'em, Sam.
- Dig deep, Samson.
You're a lion.
Be a lion.
Look at that guy!
Sam, they are frothing at the mouth.
OK...
- Larry, coil!
- Check!
- Sam!
- I improvised.
Now jump!
- Down there?
- Yes!
We're leaving, Larry!
Teensy question, Samson.
With those dogs up there, why didn't you just do what you did in the wild?
You know, lionize 'em or lionate them or lionify them?
I don't have time to fight dogs, Bridget.
We have to find Ryan, remember?
What is this stinky place?
It appears to be a human bathing area.
You mean humans don't lick themselves clean?
Disgusting!
They're hopeless.
It is hard to believe they are at the top of the food chain.
I can't imagine beginning the day without licking myself.
No hurry, but is there a plan?
Of course there's a plan.
We follow this water to the big water, and then we find the lady with...
Larry, either your stomach is growling or something in it is growling.
Wasn't me.
What?
- Smooth move, Nigel!
- Oh, boy!
Twins!
OK, Sammy, hurry it up now, 'cause these guys are seeming to have acid reflux or something!
Everybody... stay calm.
- Calm?
- Not good.
Yo.
Boo!
I'm gonna say, it looks like you and your crew here are a little far from your borough.
Far from your borough!
I love it.
We're going to the big water.
Nigel, show them what we're looking for.
- Like this?
- I think it's in her right hand.
- And isn't she blue?
- I can't do blue.
- No idea.
You?
- Doesn't even register.
- You're batting' zero, kid.
- Do the thing with...
Make your bloody mind up.
The big female with the spikes on her melon!
They're tourists.
All right, tourists, listen up.
Ya gotta get to Battery Park.
First take the Broadway culvert.
- Down the Broadway culvert?
- What's wrong with that?
- They get lost at the sewage plant!
- Get outta here!
- What are you talking about?
- How would you send 'em?
You're sendin' 'em the wrong way!
The Wall Street culvert is blocked with construction.
- That is true.
- All right.
Guys, you gonna help or not?
Yeah, sure.
Of course we're gonna help ya's.
We're one big family, right?
Except for that guy there.
He scares the...
You done runnin' your mouth yet, Carmine?
Are ya?
I apologize.
He never got over being flushed down the toilet.
Yeah.
Follow me, 'cause you four won't last ten minutes in this neighborhood.
It's a jungle down here.
- Stan, you know who that is?
- What?
No.
That's one of them talkin' kawana bears!
How ya doing?
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I've seen a lot of those things floating' here in the sewer.
That's good!
You're makin' me laugh over here.
Just wait for me!
Are we in the right place?
Any place without two hilarious alligators seems a move in the right direction.
- Sam, do you see anything up there?
- I sure do.
Well, well, well.
There she is, like Hamir said.
And it's sunrise, which means we're a tad short on time.
Guys, look.
We know the box Ryan's in is green.
It's gotta be around here, so I need you to...
Yeah.
So we should shout out if we see a box that looks like the ones over there.
It hasn't left yet!
We can make it!
- Let's go!
- Hold on, Larry!
- Which way now?
- Yeah, which way?
Run!
No!
No!
Ryan's on that thing!
We've got to stop it!
- We can't, Sam!
- I don't care!
- No, Sammy, you'll drown!
- Sam!
I failed.
Again.
I only count one failure.
It's big, but it's just one.
Goodbye, Ryan.
We're gonna miss ya.
- Samson!
- What on earth is going on?
It's a human and I do not think he works for the zoo.
Perhaps now is a good time to improvise.
What?
Great!
One problem down...
Far out.
Cool.
One disaster to go.
What are you doing?
We're headed for the other boat!
How do we steer?
Who knows how to steer?
None of us.
We're animals.
Great!
- Hold on, Larry.
Do that again.
- Do what?
Whatever you just did, but the opposite!
But I don't know my opposites!
No, Larry, like this!
I think I've got it.
Well, that was easy.
Oh, dear.
Has anyone got any eucalyptus wipes?
This isn't so difficult.
I'm the lion of the sea!
Well done, sir.
Captain of our team and now captain of this vessel.
You're brilliant.
I hate to be Miss Negative, but in this melee, we seem to have lost Ryan's boat.
- What, nothing?
- Nothing.
He's gone.
No.
There!
Nelson!
The green boxes!
- You're sure, eh?
- And there's my buddies!
And my love!
Let's go in!
- We'll head away from the sun.
- No, towards the sun.
To the north.
Starboard...
Leftboard.
Just follow my finger.
Please.
You guys wouldn't know the answer if it fell from the sky and hit you in the head.
Oh, my!
It's a bat!
It's a bat!
Get it off me!
Get it off me!
- Benny!
- Benny?
Geese!
- Are you all right?
- Yes, my princess.
Benny, you made it!
You're my best friend.
Best friends should stick together.
Even not-so-best friends, who knock you off a speeding garbage truck.
Excuse me, but I begged them to go back and get you.
Just so you know.
Benny, could you see Ryan's boat from up there?
Well, it just so happens I saw it heading that way.
And we're in luck!
- How's it goin', eh?
- Canadian geese!
Experts at intercontinental travel.
Hey, birdie, OK, is it true that Canada has lax immigration policies for koalas?
I'll take it from here.
My son's out there.
We really need your help.
Can you lead us to that boat?
No problem, eh?
Just follow us and Bob's your uncle.
Try not to lag too far behind, eh?
Hey, Benny, thanks.
And fyi, Bridget was very concerned when you fell off the truck.
Bet you didn't know I could ride geese, did you?
- Bareback.
- Oh, brother.
Sammy?
We going to the wild now?
I think we are, Larry.
I can't take it anymore.
He's taunting us!
Listen!
Stop laughing at us, you solar twit!
Captain Bligh, sir!
Are the ice cream cones ready?
The crew, they're on the verge of mutiny.
Nigel, please.
If you don't give us ice creams pretty quick, you're gonna walk the plank, sir!
- Nigel.
- I don't care if I drown,
I'm getting off this death cruise right now.
Iceberg!
Permission to go down with the ship, sir.
Hang on!
Stuff that!
Run!
Swim!
Nigel?
Look, I'm a starfish.
Guys, look.
Gosh.
Must feel like a lifetime since you've been here.
Yeah... a lifetime.
What the heck?
Wow!
Look!
They're releasing the green boxes back into the wild.
- Larry.
- Guys, they're putting animals inside the green boxes.
I just can't figure out why.
It's a tunnel to another dimension, can't you see?
- They go in...
- Who is this guy?
It's all right, Nigel.
Think it has anything to do with that?
Hang on a second.
Either I'm starving or Larry is making sense.
You're right.
Those animals are being rescued.
Ryan?
Ryan!
Oh, no!
Ryan!
We've got to move fast!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Where are you, buddy?
Ryan!
- I can't believe it!
- Samson!
I was so close.
He was right there!
- We'll never find him now!
- Come here!
Will you get a hold of yourself?
Use your instincts.
I don't want to run anymore.
Good. 'Cause frankly, you need a good sports bra.
- Ryan?
- Everything's under control.
- Temporary setback.
- I got it.
- I got Ryan's scent!
- He got it?
I mean, he got it!
Let's go!
- Hooray!
- Wait for us!
I'm not designed for this!
I want a car.
Hey, guys, I found him!
Ryan!
Doesn't anyone knock anymore?
Where's my son?
Did he come through here?
Yeah, now that I think about it, he did come through here.
Hello?
Come on out, baby lion!
Your dad's here!
Well, what do you know?
There's a whole pride of lions here!
Funky.
I was under the impression you had Ryan's scent, not this olfactory insult.
I...
I had Ryan's scent, but my predator instincts must've kicked in since, you know, I haven't eaten for a while.
Exactly!
You never know when those instincts are gonna kick in.
Excellent.
Fantastic!
We get to see the legend in action.
I'd love to, but we just don't have time.
We got the time, Sammy.
Just...
And then you do this.
And then this bit.
Rip him apart!
The horror.
I can't bear to watch!
But I have to.
Go on.
Get out of here.
- The legend dropped his dinner.
- Oh, boy.
What's wrong?
I'm not good enough for you to eat?
No.
It's just I'm allergic to nuts.
Now I get it.
You're gonna toy with me?
Beat me up a little, then pounce when I get my hopes up?
How exciting.
Come on, guys.
Ryan can't be far.
Hey!
I'm not finished with you!
I am a delicacy.
My flesh has fruity wood notes!
Watch it, you little hors d'oeuvre.
That's Samson the Wild.
You call this wild?
This is a cat!
A big, fat, tame pussycat!
- OK, that's enough!
- The pussycat hissed at me!
Maybe I should hide behind the koala for protection.
While we're at it, could you slap me in the face?
No.
What are you, a twit?
- Ignore him.
- Don't bother!
I'm leaving.
- You're weird.
- Run for your lives!
It's a lion with moral issues!
And I've had it with you too!
Thanks a lot for wrecking my day!
Teensy question.
Or more like a...
a sort of a query meets a statement.
That hyrax back there?
It was sort of like you couldn't eat him.
Yeah, and what about those dogs?
There was no munching there, either.
If I didn't know any better, I'd say that you're...
- A vegetarian?
- Nope.
- That's not what I was going to say.
- You were going to say...
- It's almost like...
- You're not from...
The wild?
Well, you're right.
I'm not from the wild.
What?
I'm just a phony.
Truth is I can't protect you out here.
Please just go back to the boat.
I've got to find my son.
Tell me we're not in a dangerous jungle with an 8-inch squirrel protecting us.
Actually, I'm nine inches, but other than that, yes.
So that means...
We are going to die!
Hey, guys!
Guys!
Will the three of you calm down?
How could he lie to us?
- We're his best friends.
- Sure.
Maybe he lied 'cause he didn't want to tell us the truth.
OK, yeah, whatever.
Whatever.
Let's just go back to the boat, then.
The fierce, the proud, the wild...
Rubbish!
But wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait!
Where you goin'?
Stop right there!
Stop!
Bridget, if you go, I'm...
I'm breaking up with you.
We were never going out in the first place.
Then we're taking a break.
- Nigel!
- All right!
Hey, listen!
I know you're scared.
But at least we got each other.
Sammy's got nobody.
He's out there all alone.
And... so is Ryan.
OK, OK, focus, Samson.
He's got to be out there somewhere.
You'll find him.
I mean, how big can this place be, anyway?
Ryan!
Hey there, little fella.
You're lost too, huh?
You remind me of my buddy back home.
A bloodthirsty monster!
Where?
Where?
He's a killer!
Get away from my baby!
Calm down, lady!
Won't anyone save my baby?
Bye-bye.
Ryan!
Ryan!
Sammy!
I wasn't meant for the wild.
I was made to nibble and be elegant and to appear in children's books as the letter G.
Come on, this isn't scary, is it?
It's just leaves and vines and...
Oh, that's my foot.
Nigel, keep a lookout back there.
- You too, Larry!
- Okeydokey.
Oh, I see.
All right, OK, yeah.
You're giving me the silent treatment.
Like I care.
Nigel!
I gave you an order.
Would a little "Sir, yes, sir!" kill ya?
Nigel.
That's not funny, Nigel.
- He's gone!
We're doomed.
- Nigel!
First Ryan, then Samson, and now Nigel!
I do believe in zoos.
- Larry, you're tensing up!
- I do, I do, I do.
- Don't panic.
I'm in charge.
- That's why we're panicking!
I say we fan out and circle.
What are we, peacocks?
We don't fan, we run.
Run for your lives, everybody!
Guys, I've got an idea.
Why don't we ask them?
It's OK...
They, you see, they got hooves.
That means they don't hunt.
They graze.
But they're licking their chops.
I'll take the one with the funny knees.
The funny knee...?
Benny, no!
Benny?
Get them.
Just, hey, back off.
I'm sorry,
I'm not that kind of koala bear.
Right.
Excuse me?
Hello?
Terribly sorry to bother you, but do you speak koala?
Sprechen Sie koala?
Right.
Could you possibly not go towards the big smoking thing?
G'day, mate G'day, mate
G'day, mate G'day, mate
G'day, mate G'day, mate
What a strange place for a party.
Very good, very organized.
Can I use your toilet?
I'm having a
Really nice day Really nice day
Really nice day
I'm having a
Really nice day Really nice day
Really nice day
- Why don't you all
- Tickle away, tickle away
They're frighteningly horrible monster beasts but they're not bad dancers.
I'm so cuddly I like you
I'm so cuddly I like you
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
- I'm having a
- Really nice day
Oh, no!
Tickle away Tickle away
I'm so cuddly, I like you Good day
- What is that?
- I am Kazar.
Leader.
Prophet.
Choreographer.
And with your help... carnivore!
No!
Don't kill me!
I've had such a weird life!
This is not fair.
Oh, I get it.
A yoga retreat.
Ryan!
You can do this.
Use your instincts.
Follow your instincts.
Use your instincts.
OK.
Down this way.
This way.
A lion cub.
We must tell Kazar.
- It's my turn to tell him.
- You got to last time.
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!
Thank you very much, but I'm afraid I've got to run.
Koalas are very busy bees.
If I could...
I'll just buzz along to the door...
For centuries, we've watched our brethren perish at the claw of the lion.
Today, we put our hooves down.
No longer will we dwell at the bottom of the food chain.
Well, yes.
I should say so.
There were those who doubted that you'd arrive to lead us.
But I always believed in the Omen.
The Omen!
Right.
Remind me again?
Sent down by the gods years ago...
Oh, no!
Not you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
Oh, Great Him, you must lead us in our transformation from prey to predator.
Hold it.
I am the Great Him?
- The Great Him?
- Him.
So this is all your fault!
That's it!
You...!
- Kazar!
- Kazar!
Don't listen to him!
- Kazar!
Over here!
- Kazar!
Over here!
How dare you interrupt my audience with the Great Him!
But... but we found a lion cub!
- You did?
- Was he with a big lion?
With big hair?
Well, a mullet, really.
Oh, Great Him, you brought two lions with you?
Well, like any Great Him,
I travel with an entourage.
Worry not, Your Himness, I shall have Blag bring the lions here.
And he better not screw this up, like you screwed up my dance number!
I lost count for one verse.
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
Why do we even bother rehearsing?
A good chorus line is so hard to put together.
Take to the skies!
We're taking!
We're taking!
- Find them!
- Yes, sir.
Bring us those lions!
The gods celebrate the fulfillment of the prophecy.
We stamp our hooves in praise of the Great Him!
Holy moly!
Holy moly Holy moly
You are our king!
Looky, looky who's there.
Surprise!
No!
Sorry we're late for dinner!
That's pathetic!
Get off!
- That didn't hurt!
- Stop!
- Ryan!
- No!
I'm coming, son!
Dad?
- Help!
- Let's scram!
- Ryan!
- What are you doing here?
- I can't believe it!
I found you.
- How'd you find me?
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
- Your paw.
- I got trapped in that box.
It's OK, son.
And then I escaped, and I ran into the jungle then those vultures came and tried to kill me.
You wouldn't have been scared.
I was.
- I have to tell you something.
- What?
Listen.
- Get 'em, Dad!
- Run!
Run!
Dad, you should be chasing them!
- Like you used to!
- Those were just stories!
But now's your chance to show me for real!
This way!
- Dad?
What's goin' on?
- Just get up into that tree!
- I think we lost them.
- What's the deal?
They're just a bunch of wimpy donkeys!
You could kick their rumps!
- Ryan, I can't fight them.
- You donkey-chickens!
Get back here!
Ryan!
I can't fight them.
What do you mean?
I was young still just a cub.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Children of all ages.
Samson!
Swallow that fear and stand tall!
Witness the greatest day in our young lion's life!
The day he discovers his roar!
Dad, I can't do it!
Now, go!
Listen as Samson unleashes a roar so mighty, it launches a wildebeest clear off the savannah!
Samson!
Dig deep!
I should have known.
If you'd been born in the wild, you'd know how to roar.
Dad?
Dad!
Dad!
Please!
Dad.
When they shipped me to the zoo, I never wanted anyone to know where I came from.
Especially those closest to me.
I should have told you sooner.
But... all those stories you tell?
I'm so sorry, Ryan.
Everything you told me was a lie?
- Dad!
- Hang on, son.
Help!
Ryan!
Ryan!
Run!
Not so fast, Tigger.
Dad!
Ryan!
Dad!
- Help!
- Ryan.
Help!
Dad!
- Ryan.
- Dad!
Help me!
What?
Wait!
What?
What?
Wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Get off me!
What is goin' on here?
- Stinky does not speak.
- It rolls like a little ball.
Wait.
You guys think I'm a...?
- Achtung, Stinky!
- Less talk, more roll.
- Ja.
- Roll!
Roll!
What the...?
Hey!
Rolling the dung is good for tight buns!
I'll give you something to roll about!
It's a good thing Bridget didn't see that!
Bridget?
Larry!
They're gone.
I gotta find them!
No!
I gotta find Samson first!
No!
First...
Sam.
Sam!
Bridget!
Larry!
Oh, Ryan!
You're alive!
Good to see you guys.
- Where's my hug?
- Larry.
- There it is.
- It's good to see you too.
What are you guys doing here?
We came here with your father to find you.
And he's probably out there right now lookin' for us.
I wish he were.
But some of these wildebeests pushed him off a cliff.
- What?
- What?
I don't think he made it.
I don't see how he could.
Oh, Ryan.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Kazar, I think you'll be very pleased with what I brought you.
What's this?
Where's the other lion?
Right.
Well, I was gonna tell you, there was this cliff and...
Why are you looking at me like that?
That's twice you've been out of step today, Blag!
You klutz.
You know we can't ascend to the top of the food chain until we eat a lion!
Well, at least there'll be enough for my ascension.
What about the rest of us?
Step-kick, pivot-kick!
Ouch!
I twisted a hoof!
You work and you work.
Then they break your heart.
- There goes my career!
- Prepare the sacrifices!
Why did I let him go off by himself?
He couldn't catch a cold, much less his own lunch.
Bet I could catch you.
Please.
My natural predator is fuel inject...
What?
I knew you weren't really gone.
I knew it!
Come on, I knew it!
We're still buddies, right?
I lost Ryan.
There were too many.
They just took him.
Who?
Who took him?
- Wildebeests.
- The freaks with the hooves!
They got Larry and Bridget too.
Couldn't fight, couldn't...
Come on, Sam.
You're a lion.
You come from a long line of kings.
Yeah, maybe you're not from the wild.
But fighting's in your blood!
No.
I'll never be a real lion.
Wrong!
You are a real lion.
Doesn't matter where you're from:
Zoo, jungle, goldfish bowl.
It's what's in here.
That determines who you are!
At least, that's what you always told your son.
Now he's out there, Sammy, and he needs you.
Who else is gonna teach him how to roar?
That's it, Sammy.
That's it.
Let's go find my son...
and my friends.
Yeah!
Nothing's gonna stop us!
Except that we have no idea where we're going!
Follow your instincts.
Follow your instincts.
- What is that?
- My... instincts?
- Benny?
- You're almost there.
That settles it, then.
My mother definitely drank pool water when she was pregnant with me.
Benny, look.
The freaks with hooves!
Ryan's in there.
You can't just barge in.
That's suicide!
- Benny, get out of my way!
- Don't listen to the rat.
- Hey, who are you calling a rat?
- You, of course.
- You'll give away our position.
- I'll have you written up for that!
Fool!
You blew our cover!
Men!
Scatter!
Not so fast!
Look who I got, Sammy.
It's your lion instincts.
Who are you guys?
- Our names aren't important.
- I'm Cloak.
He's Camo.
- We're covert agents.
- Why have you been leading me around?
- That's classified.
- Top-secret.
- The wildebeests have gone mad.
- Cloak.
It's not like I told them our plan is to use them to defeat Kazar's...
Listen, just tell me, did they take my son in there?
- That's need-to-know.
- They did.
- They think the koala's a god.
- You're the worst covert agent!
Oh, yeah?
Then why can I do this?
Men!
Hey!
No!
Stop!
Sammy!
- Idiot!
That maneuver's confidential.
- It's secret.
This one's confidential.
- Cloak!
- And this one's restricted.
Super-secret.
Top-secret.
This is ultra-secret!
Enough!
No more!
Show 'em the super-top-secret "no more?" Gotcha!
No!
I got an idea.
Who is this Great Him, anyway?
I'll take him on.
I'm the Great Her!
I'll show Him a thing or two.
I'm from New York City, for Pete's sake.
Oh, my.
You have got to be kidding me.
Nigel, I don't know what you're trying to pull,
- but I will kick your...
- Silence!
Why, you little...
Silence, again!
You do not speak to me!
Nigel, what's the deal?
Great Him, shall we prepare the feast?
Yes, we shall!
What's on the menu?
Them.
Oh, no.
Eat friends and be god, don't eat friends...
God, friends, god, friends.
God, I...
Well, that was subtle.
Prepare the meat fire!
Wait!
We cannot cook them without onion!
Onions.
Onions.
Onions.
Well, that was fast.
Let the ritual begin.
Move it!
I am so mad at you!
Wait!
We also need... hats!
Do we not have the party hats of death?
I've got mine!
And before the feast, we must all...
What the...?
...levitate and spin uncontrollably!
And feel a bit sick.
How do I stop this thing?
- Guys.
- Benny?
- Look, a squirrel!
- Larry!
We've got a plan.
Follow me.
- We?
- I can fly!
Oh, Great Him, we are humbled by your power.
Be humbled.
Only the Great Him can do this!
- Volcanic gas!
- Our cover's blown!
Major malfunction!
Abandon ship!
- Oh, boy.
- Well, about time you got here.
Great Him, it's another miracle!
You've delivered us a real lion!
Blag, your luck has turned.
Thanks to the Great Him, we shall all ascend tonight.
Nigel, we've got to create a distraction.
Hang on a sec!
I've got miracles comin' out my ears!
Ready?
Stand back as the Great Me attacks the lion over 73 times my size!
Dad?
My dad's alive!
Guys, my dad made it!
- Ryan, no!
- Hurry, I got to see him!
Whack, whack, whack!
- Dad!
- What?
Ryan!
- I planned this.
- Ryan, no!
At long last, the cosmic balance has shifted.
- Stay close.
- Prey has become predator!
And predator has become prey!
And the hoof finally trumps the claw!
Come on, Dad!
Let's show these turkey-jerkies who's at the top of the food chain!
Let's eat the brat first.
Over my dead body!
Yeah.
Dad!
He's gonna kill Samson if we don't do something!
Why don't we use the secret play?
I know.
Shut up, Larry.
That's stupid.
No!
It's brilliant!
They laughed at me when I spoke of the Omen.
But look who's laughing now!
Little to the left.
Yeah.
No!
Little to the right!
Next floor: bottom of the food chain!
Ding!
Fire!
We gotta find something bigger!
I know where we can find something bigger.
- Ready, Ryan?
- Dig deep!
You should have stayed at home.
Now our shrine will become your tomb.
Fire!
Ryan!
Ryan!
I don't typically eat dessert before the main course!
Get away from my son!
Ryan.
Ryan, are you still with me?
It's OK, Dad.
I just want you to know
I'm sorry you didn't have a father like the one I have.
Ryan.
How touching.
But then, last words usually are.
Finish them.
What are you doing?
I command you to attack them, like true predators!
We're tired of pretending to be something we're not.
But most of all, we're tired of you.
Blag.
Fine.
I'll kill them myself!
Dad, remember what you always told me in your stories:
Dig deep.
Oh, yeah, baby!
Let's go.
Yeah.
- Come on, let's get out of here!
- Get out of here!
And for the record, I've always hated your choreography.
It's so... '80s.
That's right!
Run!
Run like the cowardly prey that you are!
I will hunt you down!
Everyone!
To the boat!
Top of the food chain, Ma!
Top of the food chain...
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
I like you!
I'm so cuddly!
Hurry!
We're never gonna make it!
Push, you crazy, hairy monsters!
Push!
- Larry, throw it in reverse!
- Reverse throwing!
At least I saw the wild before it disappeared.
I can still see it.
It's right...
Here.
I found my roar.
We both did, son.
You know, Dad, this'll be our first story of Samson and Ryan the Wild.
I don't think anybody's gonna believe it.
Incoming!
I'm so cuddly!
Cuddly!
I'm so cuddly!
I know you're cuddly.
But can you float?
- I'm having a
- Really nice day
Really nice day Really nice day
Step-kick left!
Really nice day
Step-kick right!
- Splendid.
- No!
Smashing.
Hey!
- Stupendous!
- Are you guys sure about this?
Operation Snake-Over is now complete.
Hey, look, everyone!
I'm a secret agent!
Bridget, I get it.
You're more than a tall, lanky goddess.
You're a strong, independent female.
You don't need to be defined by your relationship
- and I, I respect that.
- It's about time.
What was that?
Just your daily dose of vitamin Bridget, baby.
Oh, yeah yeah!
Really nice day Really nice day
Look out!
Step-kick, pivot-kick, walk, walk, walk.
Yes!
Did y'all see that?
Check this!
Go, Blag!
Go, Blag!
Go, Blag!
Hey, Blag.
- No parking' on the dance floor.
- Parkin'?
Dad?
Make some room there, big guy!
Really nice day Really, really nice day
Yeah!
Pretty crazy, right?
Pretty wild!
Well, technically, it...
It's awesome.
Yes, right.
- I was just gonna say that.
- Come on!
Everyone!
This is gonna be a long ride home.
I'm havin' a
Really nice day Really nice day, really nice day
- I'm having a
- I'm so cuddly, I like you
G'day
What are you doing this for?
What, do you think it's funny?
Just get out.
Sorry about that, everybody.
Sorry.
Hello.
Do carry on.
Come on!
All right, everybody exit in an orderly...
All right, single file!
Keep it...
I seem to do a lot of falling and screaming in this adventure.
I'm telling you, Russ, this is a bad idea.
We shouldn't be here.
Trying to find Szura on our own is crazy.
We should go back home, get some help.
Szura could be gone by then.
Yeah... but our radio's jammed, Russ.
Our cell phones aren't working.
How we gonna call the cavalry if--
Look, he murdered 2 people last night, Dave.
- Did you not see that?
- Of course I did.
I also saw a lot of other people backing him up.
Look, if you wanna go back and call for some help, go.
Take the boat.
I'll find him on my own.
No, man.
What is the matter with you, man?
You got a death wish all of a sudden?
I'm not going back until I've got some answers.
And if you find Szura, what are you gonna do then, huh?
Huh?
You gonna kill him?
What are you gonna do then?
That's up to him.
Hey, what if he's got this whole island booby-trapped?
Well, I guess we'll find out.
I'm telling you, we need to find a working radio... so we can at least contact someone just in case we're-
In case we're dead?
No.
What the hell was that?
It sounded like some kind of signal call.
Oh, great.
"The humans are here."
Aw, man.
It's them.
What the hell happened to her?
- She was pregnant.
- Oh, I know... but what came out?
I'm not saying I won't do it, val.
I'm just saying there might be more interesting stories to cover.
People already know that their lights are on, val.
I don't know if that's necessarily news.
All right.
Yeah, I'm about 10 minutes from the plant right now.
Okay, bye.
Are you okay?
You came out so fast, I didn't see you.
You need a doctor.
You can take a shower now, Jess.
I'm done.
Thanks, Rose.
What are you doing?
I promised Larkin I'd help you get ready for school.
So what do you want to wear?
I said I can handle it, Rose.
I don't mind.
Did dad come home last night?
Nah.
Larkin said he's still working, so Mr. Elmore is going to take us to school today.
So... basically we have no parents now, is that right?
That's, uh... that's the gun Tom gave me.
Have you shot it yet?
No.
Why did daddy Tom give it to you?
Maybe he wants to see if I know how to use it.
She's waiting in your office, sir.
- Did she say what this was about?
- No.
- Tom.
- Sabrina.
- It's good to see you.
- You, too.
I heard about your shooting.
You look remarkable.
Good genes.
But what can we do for you today?
Well, this is kind of awkward.
I'd like to keep this between us.
Always.
We had a psych patient go A.W.O.L. This morning.
He's a young helicopter pilot, just back from a long tour in Iraq.
We're hoping you can help us find him before the media gets ahold of this.
Do you have any idea where he's headed?
No, but we think someone may have picked him up.
A couple of our people reported seeing an old green bronco near the west gate.
An old green bronco?
- Where are we going?
- To the hospital.
No.
- Your leg is in really bad shape.
- Well, it doesn't matter.
Look, why don't you just let me off right here?
No, I won't.
Well, I am not going to a hospital.
You understand?
Okay.
Okay.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Just right over to the table.
Okay.
Here.
I'm just gonna go get the first aid kit, okay?
William?
Are you all right?
May I have a glass of water, please?
Sure.
You think Underlay knows about this- that Szura's got his own little hybrid island here?
Of course he knows.
I'm sure he sent him half the people we saw on the beach last night.
Yeah, but why?
What are they doing?
What's the big plan?
That's what we're gonna find out.
What is that, barracks?
Looks like an old military base.
Well, where there's a satellite dish, there may be a phone.
I guess I missed "Robin Hood and the Cambrian Explosion" on Amazon.
It's the exact same layout across the hall.
It's like Japanese modern meets the Bay of Pigs.
It's bizarre.
Hey, Russ.
Look at this.
No phone.
No internet either.
This is a downlink station, Russ- only receives data.
Russ, come here.
Looks like they're pirating images off a satellite grid.
West africa... brazil... cuba.
You name it.
Look at the water.
They're monitoring temperature.
These are different gradations in the atlantic currents.
Why do they care about water temperature?
Maybe they care about what's in the water.
Let me know if this is too hot, okay?
You're already healing.
You've gone through some changes lately, haven't you?
I was a Lieutenant in the air force 53rd weather recon.
You're a hurricane hunter?
My crew was, uh... stationed out of Biloxi.
We tracked storms, mostly in the Gulf.
We were sent into the eye of hurricane eve.
You were on that plane that went down.
Yes, ma'am.
hold on to your hats, folks!
We're going inside!
All right, let's cut her open!
drop the sonde and get us a reading.
c- level pressure's at 9-3-6 kilowatts.
What is going on down there?
She's changed course.
No...
I'm seeing something else, something bigger-- under the water.
My screen's going nuts.
I got lights- thousands of lights!
Military?
No!
He's- he's... oh, my God.
I have to go.
Why?
What's wrong?
Please, I want to help you.
Did they send you?
Do you hit me on purpose to see what would happen?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't lie to me!
'Cause I'm sick of being lied to.
We won't lie to you, William.
No one is gonna lie to you.
Episode 18 Re-Evolution
He's a psych patient.
He took off this morning.
The Air Force asked me to try to round him up.
They mentioned an old green bronco, so I called your boss at work to see if you'd shown up, but... did they ask you to keep this quiet?
Why?
Because he told me a very different story.
I think you should hear it.
William?
This is Sheriff Underlay.
Would you mind telling him what you told me?
Hi.
You weren't in Iraq, were you, son?
Willie!
What are they doing here?
I called them.
Hey, look, guys, there may have been a mistake.
I'm not sure this is your man.
Oh, he's our man, sir.
Our colonel will be very grateful.
Jesse?
Hey.
How you feeling?
Okay.
Better.
That's good.
Yeah, I never thought I'd say it, but I'm actually kind of psyched to be back at school.
Brace yourself.
What do you mean?
It's just a whole different place.
Nothing is like it was.
Hey, man.
Did you sleep in your car?
You did?
My dad kicked me out last night.
I left a bowl of soup on the table, and he told me to hit it.
- That's insane.
- Yeah.
His dad's got a little...
"hurricane damage."
Yeah, my brother, too.
They both came back after the storm and were like,
"hey... what do we need our family for?"
I'm just afraid they're gonna toss my mom out on the street next.
Better than tossing her in the water.
That's what Kira's dad did to my mother.
Right, Kir?
He didn't do it on purpose.
It just... happened.
Right, it just...
Tom just happened to take my mom to the water in the middle of a category 3 hurricane-
Yeah, just stop it, Jesse.
All right?
Stop it.
See you around, brett.
Sorry.
"survival"- an elemental word, yet it means different things to different people.
To some, it may imply mere existence.
To others, superiority.
To some, peace.
Others, war.
But to us, it just means the future.
We've all been changed for a reason- a reason that will become clear to us in the coming days.
But for now, it is incumbent that we maintain our unified community, that we believe... well, at least now we know where everyone is.
When'd they get an infomercial?
And as Mr. Szura writes in his book, there is nothing more empowering than taking control of your destiny...
A book?
We were able to adapt... you think she's talking about that, um, robin hood cambrian thing?
The cambrian explosion was a time of massive evolutionary change on the planet.
I mean, virtually overnight, all kinds of new life appeared.
what, do you think that's what's going on here?
You don't have to be an alien to wipe out a species, Dave.
Humans are pretty good at it, too.
We are all here because we were able to adapt... so these hybrids are... they're just another invasive species?
Like the rabbits taking over Australia?
Melaleuca trees in the glades?
That would be the best case scenario.
What's the worst case?
That they're actually our next evolutionary upgrade.
Like we're neanderthals... and they're us?
Maybe we should ask the priest.
Sheriff Tom Underlay.
I'm here to see colonel Lopez.
She expecting you, sheriff?
No.
Well, I'm sorry, sir,
- but without the prior clearance
- Get the clearance.
I'll wait.
Right down the middle.
Do it again.
- that was short.
- That was short, though.
- There we go.
- Try again.
And another score.
- All right.
- All right.
Cool.
Okay, the kick is up...
Sweet!
Extra point for the head shot.
Man, I'm sorry, dude.
You know, maybe you guys should play somewhere else.
I'm sorry.
Are we bothering you?
'Cause last time I checked, this was a public place.
But if you've got a problem, maybe you should get out of here.
Why don't you just take it outside?
Damn it, that's my report.
Why don't you clean that up, man?
What did you say?
You knocked over the man's drink.
Why don't you clean it up?
Oh, look at this.
- Do you wanna go?
- Come on, bring it, freak.
That's enough, guys.
You can either all sit down in here, or you can sit with the principal.
It's okay, Miss Currie.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yes.
I'm sure you can all work this out.
Now... who wants to go?
You scream, and I'll cut your throat.
Russell.
- Where's Szura?
- I don't know.
Yes, you do.
Come on, get up.
You're gonna take us to him.
"For as long as we're the minority,"
"people will want to persecute us."
"So we must live apart"
"until our numbers are large enough to make a stand."
What "stand" is your leader talking about, huh?
He's not my leader.
So you're not one of his little merry men?
What's with this whole Robin Hood thing anyway?
Is he planning some kind of big "steal from the rich, give back to the poor" raid or something?
I have no idea.
How did you get here?
- The sheriff sent me.
- why?
Because I shot him.
You shot Underlay?
How about that?
A fallen priest.
- Why did you do it?
- Because he misled me.
I really believed that God saved my life the night of the hurricane.
But now I know differently.
And Tom knew all along.
So what do you think saved you?
Evil.
I don't think he's gonna like your theory much better.
You wanted your man, I got him for you.
But I'm confused about a couple things-
When did he get back from Iraq?
A few months ago.
Why?
Well, you've got such a small hospital here,
I figured, you know, you'd send him to the V.A. In Miami.
Is this what you came here to discuss, sheriff?
Major.
Excuse me?
Well, if you're gonna make this formal,
I retired as a major, colonel.
I did a little research on the way out here.
Lieutenant William Blount was a sonde operator for a c-130 weather plane out of biloxi.
That plane disappeared during the hurricane, and you yourself told me that you sent a search and rescue team to look for them, which was also lost.
3 crewmen died.
Yeah, and a 4th managed to find his way to a ranger station in the glades, half bleeding to death because he was attacked by something in the water.
His name was Paxton, and when I told you that he was at homestead hospital, you asked to help get him back to you, which I did.
- What happened to that man, colonel?
- That's classified.
You also told me that you were worried about bad publicity then, too.
But I don't think you need to worry about the press anymore.
I think you should be far more concerned about me.
How many more crew members from that weather plane do you have locked in this place?
All of them.
If we move a couple of ICU nurses into ER, we should be covered for tonight.
I'll see who's on call.
Hey, Kira.
Why aren't you in school?
It's lunch.
Got a sec?
- What's up?
- I'm worried about Jesse.
I saw him this morning.
Has he said anything to you?
About what?
I told him about how dad took you to the water the night of the hurricane.
He's pretty upset about it.
He thinks that dad did it on purpose... to make you, you know, like him.
When did you tell him this?
Yesterday.
I thought he already knew.
I was actually trying to make him feel better.
I'll talk to him.
Can you do it soon?
'Cause things are really weird at school right now.
Kids I hardly know are coming up to me and asking me which side I'm on.
"Which side"?
Yeah.
I'm just worried that Jesse's in such a bad place right now, that whatever side he chooses is gonna be the wrong one.
That's Szura's tent, but he may not be here.
He comes and goes to the mainland a lot.
There's no guards.
No vehicles either.
There still may be a phone, though.
I don't care about a phone, Dave.
I want Szura, and I want him now.
Just follow me and be quiet.
I don't think he's here.
He's got Underlay's whole life in here.
The guy's a big fan.
Oh, wow.
It's a war room.
He's got maps of every county in florida.
Has Szura told you what he and Underlay ultimately hope to achieve here?
No.
How many people are on the island?
I don't know.
A hundred?
What does he think he's gonna do with a hundred people?
I think evolution might be a little too slow for this guy, Russ.
I think Szura might be planning a little cambrian explosion of his own.
What are you talking about?
Russell believes that what's happened to you, what's happened to all these people,
may be some kind of radical evolution.
I'm sure you have some quibble with that, but...
I...
I never even considered it.
Well, I'm not surprised.
Oh, no, no.
I...
I'm not one of those people who believe that God and evolution are mutually exclusive.
Like everything else in the universe,
I believe that evolution was part of God's plan.
But... could it really be possible?
At this point, I wouldn't rule out anything.
Hey, Russ.
It's a phone.
It's a sat phone.
Look, if we call in the troops, there's no going back.
The world's gonna know about everything that's happening in our town.
Mariel, Underlay... you... we're gonna have news crews as far as china tearing our community apart.
And my kids... they may lose their mother for good.
We don't have a choice, Russ.
He's killed too many people.
Make the call.
Come on.
He could back here any second.
You don't really wanna face off alone with him.
Yes, islamorada station?
Yeah, this is florida parks ranger Russell Varon.
I need immediate coast guard assistance.
Well, thank you, Miss Hundeen.
And again, I'm so sorry about all this.
It's all right.
We've all been under a lot of stress lately.
The transition's been tough on everyone.
But we're gonna move on now.
Right, Jesse?
What about the other kids?
Scott and greg- aren't you gonna talk to them, too?
Of course.
But from what I understand, they didn't initiate this.
That's not true.
So not fair.
Why did this happen?
Because they're hybrid bastards, mom.
And it wasn't our fault.
What were they doing?
Acting... like they were better than us, which, well, I guess is true.
Right, mom?
I mean, isn't that why Tom made you one?
Tom didn't make me anything.
Oh.
Right, I forgot.
You're on the other side now, so... how am I ever gonna get a serious answer from you?
Hey, Jesse!
Come here.
- I am on your side.
- No, you're not.
You're not even my mother.
Your husband killed you.
So do me a favor.
Okay, Mariel?
Do me a favor and... stop pretending that anything's ever gonna be the way it was again.
Because it can't be.
You're not my mother.
You may find what I'm about to show you disturbing.
But I promise, we're all patriots here.
I've seen those boxes before at the site of your downed... chopper.
Would you like to know what's in them?
Sergeant, could you bring one down to the lab for us, please?
Did you know those 2 kids that Szura shot?
Not really.
The young woman was pregnant.
Why would he kill a pregnant woman?
If his goal is to build a majority, wouldn't he want all the people here having babies?
Yeah.
That might not be on his timetable right now.
Or Underlay's.
It's hard to lead an army while you're pushing a baby carriage.
Hey, they're here.
Why are there 2 boats?
Who's that guy in the little one?
Szura.
How long has this operation been running?
Since '96.
That's the same year your plane crashed, isn't it?
So you've been aware of these changes in people since '96?
Well, not at this level.
It's grown over time.
With each new hurricane, we've learned more.
But when we found the crew from this weather plane and discovered that they were all still alive... well, you can imagine how excited we were.
Oh, my God.
What are you doing with them?
Testing them.
And they've been incredible.
They've shown remarkable resiliency.
Like you, after the shooting.
They really are amazing creatures.
They aren't "creatures."
I'm sorry, Tom.
I meant no disrespect.
A lot of our funding has gone into testing, but even more has gone into clean-up.
In order to keep a project of this size under wraps, we've had to cover a lot of ground.
And... as I guess you know, each new being leaves a rather large footprint.
Thank you, sergeant.
It's a lot to comprehend, isn't it?
So you knew about me since '96?
No, we just found out recently.
I've always considered you a loyal partner, Tom.
But you have to understand why certain factions wouldn't want to bring you into this.
What factions?
Just know that everything that is happening here is in the best interest of the American people and your community.
I am my community.
What factions are you talking about?
The ones that would have you in here, if you push this.
- You Mr. Varon?
- Yeah.
We got your call.
What are you doing with him?
We picked Mr. Dennison up on the other side of the island.
"Dennison"?
Murder's a pretty serious charge, sir.
And if one of his people has committed a crime-
He committed the crime.
His name's not Dennison.
It's Szura.
I'm afraid you're wrong about that, sir.
Mr. Dennison runs a relief center here for the victims of the recent storm.
Were you a victim of the recent storm, Lieutenant?
Where are these bodies you called in about?
They were right here.
They were right here!
You know, ranger,
I think the best thing you can do right now is to go home, take care of your family and just let the people who know what's best for the community do their jobs.
What community is that?
What community?
The community that supports the killing of innocent people?
The community that would take a mother away from her own children?
That community?
A community like him?
Are you like him, or are you just on his payroll?
Because either way, you're no better than he is.
Will you be needing an escort, Mr. Varon?
Why don't you let him come with us?
It's all right, Russell.
Whatever happens, it's all right.
So, father... perhaps you'd like to stop by my house for a little confessional.
Mrs. Wade says you're doing very well in spelling.
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
And I got all my words right.
All your words?
The hardest one is "United States,"
because it's actually 2 words.
That's great, Rose.
I bet your dad is gonna be so proud of you.
What was that?
Rosie, I want you to go inside and wait for me, okay?
And I will be right there.
Jesse?
What are you doing?
Shooting.
I'm not too good, but...
Where did you get that gun?
Daddy Tom.
Tom gave you that?
Yeah.
Wasn't he thoughtful?
You've been in a fight.
And you've been drinking.
What are you shooting at?
These are pictures of your family.
Not my family.
Jesse!
No.
You're more my family than they're my family.
And you're not even my family.
You're just my dad's wife.
Give me the gun.
No way.
Now!
I'm sorry.
You can have the beer, but... the gun's mine.
Why, Ari, why?
- I'm in bed, E. Talk dirty to me.
- It's 5:00 in the morning.
- What are you wearing?
- Fuck you.
I love it when you say "fuck." Say it again.
Come on, E. It's game day, buddy.
Wake up.
This is our tradition.
Only this time we're playing for keeps.
No Pixar squirrel is going to stop us.
It's number one or bust, kid.
- You sound confident.
- Not a worry in the world.
So what are we hoping for?
$95 mil is what they're projecting.
- And what's good?
- $95 mil, Eric.
That would be good.
Expectations:
You beat 'em by a dollar...
life is great, under by a dollar...
put a gun in your mouth and make sure I'm standing behind you.
Okay, keep in touch, Ari.
Game day, baby.
No go, no go.
You'll talk dirty to E...
Come on.
- It's been three weeks.
- I know, I know.
Just after we open, baby.
Then we're all good.
And if we don't open?
"If we don't open?" What... no no no.
"If we don't open?" What do you mean by that?
Would you say that to a fighter on the morning of a bout?
"Maybe you'll get knocked out.
"See you after the fight if you're not in a coma"?
Don't jinx this, baby.
Not today.
Three soft-boiled eggs, boiled chicken, wheat toast with jam.
It's not a signature Johnny Drama breakfast but there's nothing there to upset your stomach.
Thanks, Johnny, but I'm not stressed.
You're hiding it, bro.
This is a big one.
You may not know you're stressed but trust me, you are stressed.
Moviefone says there's a 2:30 in Northridge.
The Valley?
What are you, crazy?
It's gonna reach 100° in the city today.
Vince wants to go to an out-of-the-way place.
Vince, you know my policy...
except for work,
I only go to the Valley November through March.
And even then...
only the sushi row.
Come on, Johnny, go for me.
I'd better hydrate.
So what do you think we're gonna open at, Vin?
- Oh, God.
- Come on.
I don't play this game.
Come on, let's just fuck around a little.
Pick a number.
- Stop freaking him out, Turtle.
- I'm not freaking out.
I know we're gonna open.
It's a foregone conclusion.
- I'm not worried about it.
- So pick a number.
Okay.
$50 million.
Huh?
- Would that be good?
- That would be terrible, Vince.
- Really?
- This movie opens at $50 million, we're all working at Del Taco come Monday.
- So what do we need?
- The studio's projecting 95.
95?
Nice.
Fuck 95.
I got a little projection of my own.
$114,844, 117.
- How is that?
- $1 more than "Spiderman" made.
We do any less than that I'll personally consider the movie a flop.
You're an idiot, Turtle. "Spiderman" is the biggest movie opening ever.
Plus Spiderman had a much bigger fan base than Aquaman to begin with.
Can't happen.
We got James Cameron.
And those eyes.
It can happen.
You think we got a shot to topple Spidey, E?
Let's just topple 95, huh, guys?
I'll tell you what:
If we do beat "Spiderman"
y'all are getting something sick.
Know that.
- How sick?
- What do you mean by "sick"?
It's not even 10:00 a.m. And it's burning up out there.
I know.
My widget says it's 96 already.
What the fuck's a widget?
Why are you sitting like that?
Seriously, what, are you wearing a butt plug?
No.
I brought you this for luck on the opening today.
What is this, a little Tae Bo instructor?
That is an authentic 12th century Yong Shi warrior, Ari.
He's the Mongolian symbol of strength.
If you carry him, you cannot be stopped.
This is Hollywood, Lloyd.
The only thing Mongolian is barbeque,
- but thanks.
I'll take what I can get.
- Oh, and...
I got you in with Dr. Marcus at 4:30.
Dr. Marcus?
Um, yeah.
Your wife called and said she needed an emergency session.
Fuck, Lloyd, why didn't you just tell her that I didn't have time?
- Because you do have time.
- Why didn't you lie?
'Cause I'm scared of your wife, Ari.
Yeah, me too.
Maybe if I rub this little guy's balls she'll disappear.
We're going to the Valley, Drama, not the Sahara.
Hey, don't kid yourself, E. North of Ventura Boulevard is Hell's waiting room.
Be prepared.
If you keep drinking we're gonna have to stop every 20' for you to take a leak.
That's what the empties are for.
Don't even think about pulling your dick out in my car, Drama.
- Hey, Ari.
- "Aquaman" is making waves, pal.
The first East Coast numbers are in.
They're projecting $100 mil.
Oh, that is great news.
The movie gods are smiling on us today.
Well, it's still early.
We could do better, right?
I thought I was greedy.
Listen, the over-and-under is 95.
We hit 100...
I got wood.
I'm just saying.
I mean, "Spiderman" did what, 114?
- Is there any way we can beat that?
- "Spiderman"?
Who... who's said anything about "Spiderman"?
Eric... tell me that Vinnie doesn't think that we're gonna beat the biggest opening in movie history.
I'll tell you what:
Manage your client's expectations.
Do your job.
Thank you for ruining my day.
Ari?
We all good?
I thought you're not worried about that stuff.
I'm not.
In fact, I don't wanna know anything till it's official.
- Can't we know?
- Let's roll.
103...
My God.
ALL: 104!
- Unbelievable.
- Shit.
- 105.
- Eat that, Drama.
- This is inhuman.
- I guess it's true what they say... the heat really does affect the elderly.
Yeah, seriously, Drama, 'cause I haven't seen somebody sweat like that since Patrick Ewing retired.
Great Mother of God.
Fuck.
Dude, we got a monster, Vince.
It's one theater.
Don't get crazy.
How are we gonna get seats?
Who are you talking to?
There's four taped off for us in the back as we speak.
And all it cost us... was a signed copy of the new Aquaman game.
Nice job, Turtle.
I'm making a run for cooler pastures.
Oh!
What do you think?
Oh, they're loving it.
Wait till they get a load of the end of this scene.
Jesus Christ, where's this jerkoff going?
Hey, pal... you wanna sit down?
You're about to miss the best part of the whole movie.
I have to use the bathroom.
Sit down.
I dropped my monkey!
No, come back!
Here it comes!
- What the fuck?
- Shit, projector must have gone out.
It's not just the projector.
We lost the central air.
Waiting for this movie two hours!
Ahem, sorry, folks.
It's a blackout.
Um, please calmly file into the lobby and we'll refund your money.
Whoa whoa.
Refund their money?
They already saw half the movie.
Fuck that.
- Shut the fuck up!
- Give them free popcorn or something.
Holy crap!
Aquaman!
Dude, what are you doing here?
Just checking out the movie like you guys.
Oh, but who's guarding the throne of Poseidonis?
It's about to be a madhouse in here.
- I'm gonna go get the car, all right?
- Fire up the AC.
The movie is great, Vince.
We caught the 10:00 a.m. Showing too.
That harpoon fight was badass.
Did you hear that, E?
They thought I was badass.
- I heard.
- Hey, so Vince, let me ask you... was that seahorse you rode animatronic or computer generated?
- E?
- Animatronic.
- Animatronic.
- Yes!
You owe me $20.
That is him!
- Oh my God!
- Can I have your autograph, Vince?
Whoo!
We made it.
Now let's get back to civilization.
Please.
I begged you to take the 101, but you had to take the Canyon.
- It's more scenic.
- Just get me home, please.
All the lights are out, Drama.
What would you like me to do?
You know, it looks like the whole area is blacked out.
I'm gonna call Ari.
Hey, I was just dialing you.
Hey.
That must mean that we're destined to be in love.
Yeah.
You're having a blackout over there too?
I haven't had a blackout since I took four Quaaludes and forgot I fucked Chantal Lautenberg.
Why?
'Cause we're in Northridge.
The whole area is blacked out.
- Is this gonna affect the numbers?
- I didn't even know that Northridge survived the '94 quake, E.
Don't worry about that.
Listen, you with Vinnie?
- Yeah.
- Okay, be very cool.
Do not get him excited, but the first West Coast numbers are in,
- and they're big.
- Go on.
- Eight-legs big, bitch.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The webcrawler is in our sights, Eric, and I want to squash that fucker!
So do I, Ari.
All right, thanks.
What?
Nothing.
Fuck you, "nothing." What is it?
- Nothing until it's official, right?
- Fuck official.
I don't want you to know anything I don't.
- Is it "Spiderman"?
- Spidey, E?
- Say something, dick.
- E, speak now or I'm throwing you out of the car.
"Spiderman" is in our sights.
Yes!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Yes!
- I knew it!
Fuck you, Tobey!
- It's not definite though, Vince.
- Yeah, no, I know.
That's cool.
Let's go buy some toys anyway to celebrate.
- Yes.
- I know a place.
But not in the Valley, right?
They got toys in the city, Vince.
How do you know this area, Turtle?
Best rub-and-tug in California used to be next door.
Yeah, they probably moved to Santa Monica where it's cool.
There she is.
Ducatis.
Sweet.
This is the one for me, Vince, the fastest production bike on the road.
It's yours.
E?
I appreciate it, Vince, but I'm not a motorcycle guy, and I'm not gonna take a gift just to take one.
You neither, Johnny?
You know I hate rice rockets, Vince.
Ducati's Italian, Drama.
Yeah, well, regardless it's still a foreign job.
I'm a Harley man.
Yeah, didn't you have one when you first came out here?
Yeah, I had to hock it to Michael Madsen after a couple of bleak pilot seasons.
God, I loved that bike.
Why don't we go over there tomorrow
- and make him an offer he can't refuse?
- You serious?
God, you're a fucking prince, bro.
You know, he's also got a watch of mine.
Mr. Chase, have you decided yet?
Yes, we have.
We'll take four of these.
Maybe you guys will grow to love 'em.
Not again.
So when is the last time you had sex?
- With each other or?
- If you're not taking this seriously...
I'm taking it seriously.
It's just for the money we're spending here I could get you a pro to service your even most bizarre fetishes.
Okay, you see?
This is what I'm dealing with.
Come on.
Don't.
- It's Vince.
- Ari... don't you feel that a lacking sexual relationship is a big problem in a marriage?
Oh, I do, Doc, but we fuck more than any other married couple you know.
And I know this because whenever we go out with another married couple and the subject comes up they always say, "I can't believe how often you guys fuck."
- It's Vince, baby.
- I don't give a fuck.
Okay... you know, uh, after the year that I've had and on the most important day of my life you'd think that she would ask me what I wanted, you know?
A nice blowjob, perhaps, where I could just sit back for the first time in nine months and do nothing but admire the top of her head and pray that this fucking movie opens so I can stop selling off assets.
Like we're fucking Michael Jackson.
Now I have to answer the fucking Batphone when it rings three fucking times and it's fucking Vince, okay?
So...
- Eric, speak.
- Ari...
There's been another blackout in a different part of the Valley.
You need a fucking night-light or something?
Get back over the hill, okay?
And don't call me back unless...
Fuck me.
- What's going on, Ari?
- I'm gonna call you back.
Can we prorate this session, please?
- He's gonna call us back.
- Anything to worry about?
- Hey, Aquaman.
- Oh, great.
We're being stalked by Devo.
- This isn't a coincidence, is it?
- No, we followed you.
- Replenish.
- We, uh, wanted to know if you guys wanted to come to a party.
It's our big graduation bash.
High school party?
Sorry, kid, we don't go to the parties where the girls ain't legal.
Although we do like 'em barely legal.
Come on, Vince, come with us.
It'll be like "Almost Famous."
- Hey, I like that movie.
- Vince, I'm burning up out here.
Another hour and my kidneys may shut down.
They've got a pool.
- Really?
- Yeah, it'll be great.
And it'll be a lot easier to get in with you there, Vince.
So that's it?
You guys need Vince to get you into the party.
What are you laughing at, Turtle?
You still can't get into Teddy's without Vince.
Do you wanna go?
Fuck it.
It's gonna take hours to get home anyway, right?
So you'll come?
- Yeah, we'll come.
- All right!
Aquaman to the rescue!
- Hey, girl.
- Hey!
Did kids look this young when we went to high school?
- In Drama's eighth year they did, yes.
- Six years, assholes.
And just like I did for these maggots I'm gonna do for you guys.
Someone gives you guys a hard time about being here...
Johnny Drama's got your back.
Thanks.
There are some really tough kids at this school.
Come on, I'm from New York.
Who the fuck let nerds in my house?
- Here we go.
- Jesus...
Drama's gonna get his ass kicked by a 16-year-old.
- Hey, Kessler.
- Who let you losers in?
- These guys are with us.
- Yeah?
Who the fuck are you?
Uh, he's my brother.
Sorry, we were just passing by, we saw the party, we figured we'd drop in.
Whoa whoa, holy shit.
You're Vince Chase.
You're with these two?
Jay and Reggie?
Yeah, they're my cousins.
But hey, it's cool.
We'll find another party.
Oh, no no no no.
No, you stay.
Reggie and Jay, stay.
This old guy, he can stay too.
Uh, you need a beer, Vince?
That'd be good.
Thanks.
Holy shit, Vince Chase.
Hey everyone, fuckin' Aquaman is at my house!
Give me something good, Ari.
There's nothing good at all, E. Nothing good.
- Why?
What's happening?
- There are massive rolling blackouts from the heat.
They're hitting the whole fucking coast from San Francisco down to San Diego.
Shit.
Well, I guess we can kiss "Spiderman" goodbye.
Forget "Spiderman." I just named two of the most populated cities in the whole fucking country.
- So what does that mean, Ari?
- It means that we are fucked.
We took a massive hit on the midday numbers and now they are projecting 85.
Jesus Christ.
What am I gonna tell Vince?
Same thing you've been telling him all day... nothing!
Keep your mouth shut until it's official.
- Yeah, when's that gonna be?
- In a few hours, all right?
I want you to email me your address and I will come and tell him with you, all right?
Lloyd!
What happened to the music?
It's a blackout, baby!
Into the pool!
Yeah, our moms say Reggie looked exactly like I did when I was his age.
You don't see it?
- A little, I guess.
- And you're related to Jay too?
Oh, we're practically like brothers.
You girls should take care of these two.
I'm gonna get a drink.
You want anything?
All good, Vince.
- Good to hear it, Reggie.
- Jay.
Ha-ha!
Life is good, huh?
Any word?
- No, nothing official.
- What does that mean?
How is this possible?
An hour ago we're the biggest opening ever
- and now we're a disaster?
- Yeah, well, fucking blackouts.
Fucking blackouts.
See, this is why I don't like to get caught up in this shit.
You shouldn't let me get caught up in it, E.
- Vince, come on.
- I know, I know.
I asked.
I'm sorry, buddy.
Yeah.
Look at these kids.
This used to be us.
Remember how we used to talk about coming out to Hollywood?
- It wasn't about money.
- No, it wasn't.
Fuck it.
We're not gonna let this town make it about money now.
- Let's get hammered.
- With 17-year-olds?
- We'll make their night.
- All right.
ARl:
Blackouts?
!
Fucking blackouts?
Thank you very much!
The town will understand, Ari.
It's not the movie's fault.
Baby, it wasn't the Cubs' fault when that douche bag grabbed the foul ball either, but they still don't get a World Series ring.
There are no asterisks in this life, only scoreboards, and ours is currently reading "Fucked."
Well, there's nothing you can do about it now, so why don't you sit down and relax?
Baby, I can't relax until I tell Vinnie.
I gotta go to the Valley.
After the call.
And who knows when that will be?
Baby, isn't it a little convenient that the kids are at your mother's?
Ari, I've been patient, but now whatever happens is totally out of your control.
So let's go upstairs.
Fine, but I'm not gonna like it.
Oh really?
All right, I may like it just a little bit.
Oh.
Baby, I don't want you to hear this.
I could cry.
I have to go to the Valley.
I promise you when I get back, no matter what, we're gonna dent that headboard.
No bullshit.
I guarantee you you will not walk right tomorrow.
Tell me something good.
Vince, Vince, Vince, Vince!
- So you work with Vince?
- Yep.
- Is it fun?
- Yep.
You don't talk much, huh?
Not to high school girls, sweetheart.
No offense.
I'm not in high school.
This is my little brother's party.
I'm just chaperoning.
Oh-hh.
Ew.
That was a real creepy turn.
You may have a couple pounds on me but nothing outweighs experience.
You ready?
Are you ready?
Hey, everybody!
Do you know how good your lives are right now?
Yeah!
My boys are here from high school and we wish we could be back living like this!
Yeah!
What the fuck is he doing?
He wanted his "Almost Famous" moment.
ARl:
I told you not to tell him anything until it was official.
Aw, what the fuck is the difference, Ari?
Hey, Vinnie!
Ari is in the Valley?
Holy shit, we really must be fucked, huh?
What are they projecting now?
45, Ari?
- 116, actually.
- What?
- 116, kid!
- How's that possible?
You guys ever hear of a hanging chad?
Where the fuck am I?
Listen, the biggest thing the blackouts affected were the actual reporting of the numbers.
- We beat "Spiderman"?
- Well, it's only Friday, but if there isn't a tornado in the Midwest
I think we've got a good goddamn shot, my friend.
Hey, everybody, you've got the biggest movie star on the planet on your roof right now.
It's all you, baby!
- Number one, baby.
- Yeah!
Do it!
So whose dad is this?
I don't know.
Why don't you throw him in the pool?
Fuck you, "throw me in the pool."
Hey, Kong, go get us some beers.
- Put him in!
Put him in!
- Go go!
Hey, you little fuck, these are $900 shoes!
Okay, you guys are not gonna believe this!
Those two girls you introduced us to?
The most untouchable girls in school.
But guess what...
They like you.
They wanna hang in my basement.
Basement!
Nice!
The only problem is, we can't all fit on the Vespa.
You can't roll chicks in a Vespa, bro.
Well, we were hoping maybe you could give us a lift.
- A lift?
- Yeah, right.
I can't do that.
But what I can do is this:
Turtle, give our new best friends
- the keys to the Mas'.
- There you go.
Oh, that is so cool!
You're lending us your car?
- No no no.
- How do we get it back to you?
You don't.
You return it to the Beverly Hills Maserati dealership.
Your lease ends at the end of August.
- No way.
- Holy shit.
ARl:
That was actually refreshing, but I have to go home to hammer the wife.
Give us a lift.
Anything to keep me away from my house.
Come on, bro.
We out.
Aw.
Yeah, the Valley ain't so bad.
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Why, Ari, why?
- I'm in bed, E. Talk dirty to me.
- It's 5:00 in the morning.
- What are you wearing?
- Fuck you.
I love it when you say "fuck." Say it again.
Come on, E. It's game day, buddy.
Wake up.
This is our tradition.
Only this time we're playing for keeps.
No Pixar squirrel is going to stop us.
It's number one or bust, kid.
- You sound confident.
- Not a worry in the world.
So what are we hoping for?
$95 mil is what they're projecting.
- And what's good?
- $95 mil, Eric.
That would be good.
Expectations:
You beat 'em by a dollar...
life is great, under by a dollar...
put a gun in your mouth and make sure I'm standing behind you.
Okay, keep in touch, Ari.
Game day, baby.
No go, no go.
You'll talk dirty to E...
Come on.
- It's been three weeks.
- I know, I know.
Just after we open, baby.
Then we're all good.
(SIGHS)
And if we don't open?
"If we don't open?" What... no no no.
"If we don't open?" What do you mean by that?
Would you say that to a fighter on the morning of a bout?
"Maybe you'll get knocked out.
"See you after the fight if you're not in a coma"?
Don't jinx this, baby.
Not today.
Three soft-boiled eggs, boiled chicken, wheat toast with jam.
It's not a signature Johnny Drama breakfast but there's nothing there to upset your stomach.
Thanks, Johnny, but I'm not stressed.
(CHUCKLES) You're hiding it, bro.
This is a big one.
You may not know you're stressed but trust me, you are stressed.
Moviefone says there's a 2:30 in Northridge.
The Valley?
What are you, crazy?
It's gonna reach 100° in the city today.
Vince wants to go to an out-of-the-way place.
Vince, you know my policy...
except for work,
I only go to the Valley November through March.
And even then...
only the sushi row.
Come on, Johnny, go for me.
I'd better hydrate.
So what do you think we're gonna open at, Vin?
- Oh, God.
- Come on.
I don't play this game.
Come on, let's just fuck around a little.
Pick a number.
- Stop freaking him out, Turtle.
- I'm not freaking out.
I know we're gonna open.
It's a foregone conclusion.
- I'm not worried about it.
- So pick a number.
Okay.
$50 million.
Huh?
- Would that be good?
- That would be terrible, Vince.
- Really?
- This movie opens at $50 million, we're all working at Del Taco come Monday.
- So what do we need?
- The studio's projecting 95.
95?
Nice.
Fuck 95.
I got a little projection of my own.
$114,844, 117.
- How is that?
- $1 more than "Spiderman" made.
We do any less than that I'll personally consider the movie a flop.
You're an idiot, Turtle. "Spiderman" is the biggest movie opening ever.
Plus Spiderman had a much bigger fan base than Aquaman to begin with.
Can't happen.
We got James Cameron.
And those eyes.
It can happen.
You think we got a shot to topple Spidey, E?
Let's just topple 95, huh, guys?
I'll tell you what:
If we do beat "Spiderman"
y'all are getting something sick.
Know that.
- How sick?
- What do you mean by "sick"?
- (PEOPLE CHATTERING) - (PHONES RINGING)
It's not even 10:00 a.m. And it's burning up out there.
I know.
My widget says it's 96 already.
What the fuck's a widget?
Why are you sitting like that?
Seriously, what, are you wearing a butt plug?
(CHUCKLES) No.
I brought you this for luck on the opening today.
What is this, a little Tae Bo instructor?
That is an authentic 12th century Yong Shi warrior, Ari.
He's the Mongolian symbol of strength.
If you carry him, you cannot be stopped.
This is Hollywood, Lloyd.
The only thing Mongolian is barbeque,
- but thanks.
I'll take what I can get.
- Oh, and...
I got you in with Dr. Marcus at 4:30.
Dr. Marcus?
Um, yeah.
Your wife called and said she needed an emergency session.
Fuck, Lloyd, why didn't you just tell her that I didn't have time?
- Because you do have time.
- Why didn't you lie?
'Cause I'm scared of your wife, Ari.
Yeah, me too.
Maybe if I rub this little guy's balls she'll disappear.
We're going to the Valley, Drama, not the Sahara.
Hey, don't kid yourself, E. North of Ventura Boulevard is Hell's waiting room.
Be prepared.
If you keep drinking we're gonna have to stop every 20' for you to take a leak.
- That's what the empties are for.
- (PHONE RINGING)
Don't even think about pulling your dick out in my car, Drama.
- Hey, Ari.
- "Aquaman" is making waves, pal.
The first East Coast numbers are in.
They're projecting $100 mil.
Oh, that is great news.
The movie gods are smiling on us today.
Well, it's still early.
We could do better, right?
I thought I was greedy.
Listen, the over-and-under is 95.
We hit 100...
I got wood.
I'm just saying.
I mean, "Spiderman" did what, 114?
- Is there any way we can beat that?
- "Spiderman"?
Who... who's said anything about "Spiderman"?
Eric... tell me that Vinnie doesn't think that we're gonna beat the biggest opening in movie history.
I'll tell you what:
Manage your client's expectations.
Do your job.
Thank you for ruining my day.
VINCE:
Ari?
We all good?
I thought you're not worried about that stuff.
I'm not.
In fact, I don't wanna know anything till it's official.
- Can't we know?
- Let's roll.
- (REGGAETON MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO)
- ALL: 103...
DRAMA:
My God.
ALL: 104!
DRAMA:
Unbelievable.
TURTLE:
Shit.
- 105.
- TURTLE:
Eat that, Drama.
- This is inhuman.
- I guess it's true what they say... the heat really does affect the elderly.
Yeah, seriously, Drama, 'cause I haven't seen somebody sweat like that since Patrick Ewing retired.
Great Mother of God.
Fuck.
Dude, we got a monster, Vince.
It's one theater.
Don't get crazy.
DRAMA:
How are we gonna get seats?
Who are you talking to?
There's four taped off for us in the back as we speak.
And all it cost us... was a signed copy of the new Aquaman game.
(CHUCKLES) Nice job, Turtle.
I'm making a run for cooler pastures.
Oh!
(LAUGHS)
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
What do you think?
Oh, they're loving it.
Wait till they get a load of the end of this scene.
TURTLE:
Jesus Christ, where's this jerkoff going?
Hey, pal... you wanna sit down?
You're about to miss the best part of the whole movie.
I have to use the bathroom.
Sit down.
(MUSIC INTENSIFIES)
(ALL SCREAMING)
I dropped my monkey!
MOTHER:
No, come back!
Here it comes!
- (PROJECTOR CLICKS) - (ALL GROANING)
- What the fuck?
- Shit, projector must have gone out.
It's not just the projector.
We lost the central air.
WOMAN:
Waiting for this movie two hours!
Ahem, sorry, folks.
It's a blackout.
Um, please calmly file into the lobby and we'll refund your money.
Whoa whoa.
Refund their money?
They already saw half the movie.
Fuck that.
- MAN:
Shut the fuck up!
- Give them free popcorn or something.
(ALL CHATTERING)
Holy crap!
Aquaman!
Dude, what are you doing here?
Just checking out the movie like you guys.
Oh, but who's guarding the throne of Poseidonis?
- (CROWD CHUCKLES)
- It's about to be a madhouse in here.
- I'm gonna go get the car, all right?
- Fire up the AC.
The movie is great, Vince.
We caught the 10:00 a.m. Showing too.
That harpoon fight was badass.
Did you hear that, E?
They thought I was badass.
- I heard.
- Hey, so Vince, let me ask you... was that seahorse you rode animatronic or computer generated?
- E?
- Animatronic.
- Animatronic.
- Yes!
You owe me $20.
- GIRL:
That is him!
- (GIRLS SCREAMING)
- Oh my God!
- GIRL:
Can I have your autograph, Vince?
(GIRLS SCREAMING)
(SCREAMING CONTINUES)
Whoo!
We made it.
Now let's get back to civilization.
Please.
(CAR HORNS HONKING)
(SIGHS) I begged you to take the 101, but you had to take the Canyon.
- It's more scenic.
- Just get me home, please.
All the lights are out, Drama.
What would you like me to do?
E:
You know, it looks like the whole area is blacked out.
- I'm gonna call Ari.
- (PHONE RINGS)
Hey, I was just dialing you.
Hey.
That must mean that we're destined to be in love.
Yeah.
You're having a blackout over there too?
I haven't had a blackout since I took four Quaaludes and forgot I fucked Chantal Lautenberg.
Why?
'Cause we're in Northridge.
The whole area is blacked out.
- Is this gonna affect the numbers?
- I didn't even know that Northridge survived the '94 quake, E.
Don't worry about that.
Listen, you with Vinnie?
- Yeah.
- Okay, be very cool.
Do not get him excited, but the first West Coast numbers are in,
- and they're big.
- Go on.
- Eight-legs big, bitch.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The webcrawler is in our sights, Eric, and I want to squash that fucker!
(CHUCKLES) So do I, Ari.
All right, thanks.
What?
Nothing.
Fuck you, "nothing." What is it?
- Nothing until it's official, right?
- Fuck official.
I don't want you to know anything I don't.
- Is it "Spiderman"?
- Spidey, E?
- Say something, dick.
- E, speak now or I'm throwing you out of the car.
"Spiderman" is in our sights.
- (ALL LAUGH)
- Yes!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Yes!
- I knew it!
Fuck you, Tobey!
- It's not definite though, Vince.
- Yeah, no, I know.
That's cool.
Let's go buy some toys anyway to celebrate.
- DRAMA:
Yes.
- I know a place.
But not in the Valley, right?
They got toys in the city, Vince.
How do you know this area, Turtle?
Best rub-and-tug in California used to be next door.
Yeah, they probably moved to Santa Monica where it's cool.
There she is.
VINCE:
Ducatis.
Sweet.
This is the one for me, Vince, the fastest production bike on the road.
It's yours.
E?
I appreciate it, Vince, but I'm not a motorcycle guy, and I'm not gonna take a gift just to take one.
VINCE:
You neither, Johnny?
You know I hate rice rockets, Vince.
Ducati's Italian, Drama.
Yeah, well, regardless it's still a foreign job.
I'm a Harley man.
Yeah, didn't you have one when you first came out here?
Yeah, I had to hock it to Michael Madsen after a couple of bleak pilot seasons.
God, I loved that bike.
Why don't we go over there tomorrow
- and make him an offer he can't refuse?
- You serious?
God, you're a fucking prince, bro.
You know, he's also got a watch of mine.
Mr. Chase, have you decided yet?
Yes, we have.
We'll take four of these.
Maybe you guys will grow to love 'em.
ERIC:
Not again.
So when is the last time you had sex?
- With each other or?
- If you're not taking this seriously...
I'm taking it seriously.
It's just for the money we're spending here I could get you a pro to service your even most bizarre fetishes.
Okay, you see?
This is what I'm dealing with.
- Come on.
- (PHONE RINGS)
Don't.
- It's Vince.
- DR. MARCUS:
Ari...
- (PHONE BEEPS) ...don't you feel that a lacking sexual relationship is a big problem in a marriage?
Oh, I do, Doc, but we fuck more than any other married couple you know.
And I know this because whenever we go out with another married couple and the subject comes up they always say, "I can't believe how often you guys fuck."
(PHONE RINGS)
(RINGING CONTINUES)
- It's Vince, baby.
- I don't give a fuck.
- (PHONE BEEPS)
- Okay... you know, uh, after the year that I've had and on the most important day of my life you'd think that she would ask me what I wanted, you know?
A nice blowjob, perhaps, where I could just sit back for the first time in nine months and do nothing but admire the top of her head and pray that this fucking movie opens
- so I can stop selling off assets - (PHONE RINGS)
Like we're fucking Michael Jackson.
Now I have to answer the fucking Batphone when it rings three fucking times and it's fucking Vince, okay?
So...
- Eric, speak.
- DR. MARCUS:
Ari...
There's been another blackout in a different part of the Valley.
You need a fucking night-light or something?
Get back over the hill, okay?
And don't call me back unless...
Fuck me.
- What's going on, Ari?
- I'm gonna call you back.
(GROANS)
Can we prorate this session, please?
- He's gonna call us back.
- Anything to worry about?
- Hey, Aquaman.
- DRAMA:
Oh, great.
We're being stalked by Devo.
- This isn't a coincidence, is it?
- No, we followed you.
- Replenish.
- We, uh, wanted to know if you guys wanted to come to a party.
It's our big graduation bash.
High school party?
Sorry, kid, we don't go to the parties where the girls ain't legal.
Although we do like 'em barely legal.
Come on, Vince, come with us.
It'll be like "Almost Famous."
- Hey, I like that movie.
- Vince, I'm burning up out here.
Another hour and my kidneys may shut down.
They've got a pool.
- Really?
- Yeah, it'll be great.
And it'll be a lot easier to get in with you there, Vince.
So that's it?
You guys need Vince to get you into the party.
What are you laughing at, Turtle?
You still can't get into Teddy's without Vince.
Do you wanna go?
Fuck it.
It's gonna take hours to get home anyway, right?
So you'll come?
- Yeah, we'll come.
- All right!
Aquaman to the rescue!
(ROCK 'N' ROLL PLAYING)
- Hey, girl.
- Hey!
Did kids look this young when we went to high school?
- In Drama's eighth year they did, yes.
- Six years, assholes.
And just like I did for these maggots I'm gonna do for you guys.
Someone gives you guys a hard time about being here...
Johnny Drama's got your back.
Thanks.
There are some really tough kids at this school.
Come on, I'm from New York.
MALE TEEN:
Who the fuck let nerds in my house?
ERIC:
Here we go.
TURTLE:
Jesus...
Drama's gonna get his ass kicked by a 16-year-old.
- Hey, Kessler.
- Who let you losers in?
- These guys are with us.
- Yeah?
Who the fuck are you?
Uh, he's my brother.
Sorry, we were just passing by, we saw the party, we figured we'd drop in.
Whoa whoa, holy shit.
You're Vince Chase.
You're with these two?
Jay and Reggie?
Yeah, they're my cousins.
But hey, it's cool.
We'll find another party.
Oh, no no no no.
No, you stay.
Reggie and Jay, stay.
This old guy, he can stay too.
(CHUCKLES) Uh, you need a beer, Vince?
That'd be good.
Thanks.
Holy shit, Vince Chase.
(SHOUTS) Hey everyone, fuckin' Aquaman is at my house!
- (ALL CHEER) - (PHONE RINGS)
Give me something good, Ari.
There's nothing good at all, E. Nothing good.
- Why?
What's happening?
- There are massive rolling blackouts from the heat.
They're hitting the whole fucking coast from San Francisco down to San Diego.
Shit.
Well, I guess we can kiss "Spiderman" goodbye.
Forget "Spiderman." I just named two of the most populated cities in the whole fucking country.
- So what does that mean, Ari?
- It means that we are fucked.
We took a massive hit on the midday numbers and now they are projecting 85.
Jesus Christ.
What am I gonna tell Vince?
Same thing you've been telling him all day... nothing!
Keep your mouth shut until it's official.
- Yeah, when's that gonna be?
- In a few hours, all right?
I want you to email me your address and I will come and tell him with you, all right?
Lloyd!
- (MUSIC STOPS)
- GIRL:
What happened to the music?
It's a blackout, baby!
Into the pool!
(ALL CHEERING)
Yeah, our moms say Reggie looked exactly like I did when I was his age.
You don't see it?
GIRL:
A little, I guess.
GIRL 2:
And you're related to Jay too?
Oh, we're practically like brothers.
You girls should take care of these two.
I'm gonna get a drink.
You want anything?
All good, Vince.
- Good to hear it, Reggie.
- Jay.
Ha-ha!
Life is good, huh?
Any word?
- No, nothing official.
- What does that mean?
(WHIMPERS)
How is this possible?
An hour ago we're the biggest opening ever
- and now we're a disaster?
- Yeah, well, fucking blackouts.
Fucking blackouts.
See, this is why I don't like to get caught up in this shit.
You shouldn't let me get caught up in it, E.
- Vince, come on.
- I know, I know.
I asked.
- (SIGHS)
- I'm sorry, buddy.
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)
Look at these kids.
This used to be us.
Remember how we used to talk about coming out to Hollywood?
- It wasn't about money.
- No, it wasn't.
Fuck it.
We're not gonna let this town make it about money now.
- Let's get hammered.
- With 17-year-olds?
- We'll make their night.
- All right.
ARl:
Blackouts?
!
Fucking blackouts?
Thank you very much!
The town will understand, Ari.
It's not the movie's fault.
Baby, it wasn't the Cubs' fault when that douche bag grabbed the foul ball either, but they still don't get a World Series ring.
There are no asterisks in this life, only scoreboards, and ours is currently reading "Fucked."
Well, there's nothing you can do about it now, so why don't you sit down and relax?
Baby, I can't relax until I tell Vinnie.
I gotta go to the Valley.
After the call.
And who knows when that will be?
Baby, isn't it a little convenient that the kids are at your mother's?
Ari, I've been patient, but now whatever happens is totally out of your control.
So let's go upstairs.
Fine, but I'm not gonna like it.
Oh really?
All right, I may like it just a little bit.
- Oh.
- (PHONE RINGING)
- (GROANS)
- Baby, I don't want you to hear this.
I could cry.
I have to go to the Valley.
I promise you when I get back, no matter what, we're gonna dent that headboard.
No bullshit.
I guarantee you you will not walk right tomorrow.
(CHUCKLES)
Tell me something good.
Vince, Vince, Vince, Vince!
(CHEERING)
- So you work with Vince?
- Yep.
- Is it fun?
- Yep.
You don't talk much, huh?
Not to high school girls, sweetheart.
No offense.
I'm not in high school.
This is my little brother's party.
I'm just chaperoning.
Oh-hh.
Ew.
That was a real creepy turn.
(ALL CHEERING)
You may have a couple pounds on me but nothing outweighs experience.
You ready?
(EXHALES) Are you ready?
(ALL SHOUTING)
VINCE: (SHOUTING) Hey, everybody!
Do you know how good your lives are right now?
Yeah!
(ALL CHEERING)
My boys are here from high school and we wish we could be back living like this!
Yeah!
What the fuck is he doing?
He wanted his "Almost Famous" moment.
ARl:
I told you not to tell him anything until it was official.
E:
Aw, what the fuck is the difference, Ari?
Hey, Vinnie!
(GUFFAWS) Ari is in the Valley?
Holy shit, we really must be fucked, huh?
What are they projecting now?
45, Ari?
- 116, actually.
- What?
- 116, kid!
- E:
How's that possible?
You guys ever hear of a hanging chad?
Where the fuck am I?
Listen, the biggest thing the blackouts affected were the actual reporting of the numbers.
- We beat "Spiderman"?
- Well, it's only Friday, but if there isn't a tornado in the Midwest
I think we've got a good goddamn shot, my friend.
Hey, everybody, you've got the biggest movie star on the planet on your roof right now.
(CHEERING)
It's all you, baby!
- Number one, baby.
- OTHERS:
Yeah!
Do it!
So whose dad is this?
I don't know.
Why don't you throw him in the pool?
Fuck you, "throw me in the pool."
Hey, Kong, go get us some beers.
(ALL SHOUTING)
- Put him in!
Put him in!
- Go go!
(SCREAMING)
Hey, you little fuck, these are $900 shoes!
Okay, you guys are not gonna believe this!
Those two girls you introduced us to?
The most untouchable girls in school.
But guess what...
They like you.
They wanna hang in my basement.
- (ALL LAUGHING)
- Basement!
Nice!
The only problem is, we can't all fit on the Vespa.
You can't roll chicks in a Vespa, bro.
Well, we were hoping maybe you could give us a lift.
- A lift?
- DRAMA:
Yeah, right.
I can't do that.
But what I can do is this:
Turtle, give our new best friends
- the keys to the Mas'.
- There you go.
Oh, that is so cool!
You're lending us your car?
- No no no.
- How do we get it back to you?
You don't.
You return it to the Beverly Hills Maserati dealership.
Your lease ends at the end of August.
- No way.
- Holy shit.
ARl:
That was actually refreshing, but I have to go home to hammer the wife.
Give us a lift.
Anything to keep me away from my house.
Come on, bro.
We out.
Aw.
Yeah, the Valley ain't so bad.
(ROCK SONG PLAYING)
Why, Ari, why?
- I'm in bed, E. Talk dirty to me.
- It's five in the morning.
- What are you wearing?
- Fuck you.
I love it when you say "fuck".
Say it again.
Come on, E. It's game day, buddy.
Wake up.
This is our tradition.
Only this time, we're playing for keeps.
No Pixar squirrel is going to stop us.
It's number one or bust, kid.
- You sound confident.
- Not a worry in the world.
- So what are we hoping for?
- 95 mil is what they're projecting.
- And what's good?
- 95 mil, Eric.
That would be good.
Expectations.
Beat 'em by a dollar, great.
Under by a dollar, put a gun in your mouth and make sure I'm behind you.
OK, keep in touch, Ari.
Game day, baby.
No go, no go.
- You'll talk dirty to E...
- Come on.
- It's been three weeks.
- I know.
Just after we open, baby.
Then we're all good.
And if we don't open?
If we don't open?
If we don't open?
What do you mean by that?
Would you say that to a fighter? "You may get knocked out.
See you if you're not in a coma"?
Don't jinx this, baby.
Not today.
Three soft-boiled eggs, boiled chicken, wheat toast with jam.
It's not a signature Johnny Drama breakfast, but nothing will upset your stomach.
- Thanks, Johnny, but I'm not stressed.
- You're hiding it, bro.
This is a big one.
You may not know you're stressed but trust me, you are stressed.
Moviefone says there's at 2:30 in Northridge.
The Valley?
What are you, crazy?
It'll reach 100 degrees in the city today.
Vince wants to go to an out-of-the-way place.
Vince, you know my policy.
Except for work, I only go to the Valley November through March.
Even then, only the sushi row.
Come on, Johnny, go for me.
- I'd better hydrate.
- What do you think we'll open at, Vin?
- Oh, God.
- Come on.
I don't play this game.
Let's fuck around a little.
Pick a number.
- Stop freaking him out.
- I'm not freaking out.
I know we'll open.
It's a foregone conclusion.
I'm not worried.
- So pick a number.
- OK.
50 million.
- Would that be good?
- That would be terrible, Vince.
- Really?
- This movie opens at $50 million,
- we're working at Del Taco on Monday.
- What do we need?
- The studio's projecting 95.
- 95?
Nice.
Fuck 95.
I got a little projection of my own.
114,844, 117.
- How is that?
- $1 more than Spider-Man made.
We do any less, I'll consider the movie a flop.
Idiot.
Spider-Man is the biggest movie opening ever.
Plus Spider-Man had a much bigger fan base than Aquaman to begin with.
Can't happen.
We got James Cameron.
And those eyes.
It can happen.
- Think we got a shot to topple Spidey, E?
- Let's just topple 95.
I'll tell you what, if we do beat Spider-Man, y'all are getting something sick, know that.
- How sick?
- What do you mean by sick?
It's all in there.
Listen...
- It's not even ten and it's burning up out there.
- I know.
My widget says it's 96 already.
What's a widget?
Why are you sitting like that?
- Are you wearing a butt plug?
- No!
I brought you this for luck on the opening today.
What is this, a little Tae Bo instructor?
That is an authentic 12th-century Yong Shi warrior, Ari.
A Mongolian symbol of strength.
If you carry him, you cannot be stopped.
This is Hollywood.
The only thing Mongolian is barbecue, but thanks.
And...
I got you in with Dr Marcus at 4:30.
- Dr Marcus?
- Yeah.
Your wife called and said she needed an emergency session.
Why didn't you tell her I didn't have time?
- Because you do have time.
- Why didn't you lie?
Cos I'm scared of your wife, Ari.
Yeah, me too.
Maybe if I rub this little guy's balls, she'll disappear.
We're going to the Valley, Drama, not the Sahara.
Don't kid yourself, E. North of Ventura Boulevard is Hell's waiting room.
Be prepared.
We'll have to stop every 20 feet for you to take a leak.
That's what the empties are for.
Don't even think about pulling your dick out in my car.
Aquaman's making waves, pal.
The first East Coast numbers are in.
They're projecting 100 mil.
That is great news.
The movie gods are smiling on us today.
It's still early.
We can do better, right?
I thought I was greedy.
The over-and-under is 95.
We hit 100, I got wood.
I'm just saying.
I mean, Spider-Man did what, 114?
- Is there any way we can beat that?
- Spider-Man?
Who said anything about Spider-Man?
Eric.
Tell me that Vinnie doesn't think we'll beat the biggest opening in movie history.
I'll tell you what.
Manage your client's expectations.
Do your job.
Thank you for ruining my day.
We all good?
- I thought you're not worried about that stuff.
- I'm not.
I don't wanna know anything till it's official.
- Can't we know?
- Let's roll.
103...
My God.
- 104!
- Unbelievable.
- Shit.
- 105.
- Eat that, Drama.
- Inhuman.
I guess it's true, the heat really does affect the elderly.
Yeah, Drama, I haven't seen somebody sweat like that since Patrick Ewing retired.
Great Mother of God.
- Fuck.
Dude, we got a monster, Vince.
- It's one theatre.
Don't get crazy.
- How will we get seats?
- Who are you talking to?
There's four taped off for us in the back as we speak.
And all it cost us... was a signed copy of the new Aquaman game.
Nice job, Turtle.
I'm making a run for cooler pastures.
What do you think?
They're loving it.
Wait till they get a load of the end of this scene.
Christ, where's this jerkoff going?
Hey, pal.
You wanna sit down?
You're about to miss the best part of the movie.
I have to use the bathroom.
Sit down.
I dropped my monkey!
No, come back!
Here it comes!
- What the fuck?
- Shit, projector must have gone out.
It's not just the projector.
We lost the central air.
...waiting for two hours!
Sorry, folks.
It's a blackout.
Please calmly file into the lobby and we'll refund your money.
Refund their money?
They already saw half the movie.
Fuck that.
- Shut the fuck up!
- Give them free popcorn!
- Holy crap!
Aquaman!
- Dude, what are you doing here?
- Just checking out the movie like you guys.
- Who's guarding the throne of Poseidonis?
It's about to be a madhouse here.
- I'm gonna go get the car.
- Fire up the AC.
The movie's great.
We caught the ten am showing too.
That harpoon fight was badass.
- Hear that?
They thought I was badass.
- I heard.
Vince, was that seahorse you rode animatronic or computer generated?
Animatronic.
Yes!
You owe me 20.
That is him!
- My God!
- Can I have your autograph, Vince?
We made it.
Now, let's get back to civilisation.
Please.
I begged you to take the 101, but you had to take the Canyon.
- It's more scenic.
- Just get me home, please.
All the lights are out, Drama.
What shall I do?
You know, it looks like the whole area is blacked out.
I'm gonna call Ari.
Hey, I was just dialling you.
That must mean we're destined to be in love.
Yeah.
You having a blackout too?
Not since I took four Quaaludes and forgot I fucked Chantal Lautenberg.
Why?
We're in Northridge.
It's blacked out.
Will this affect the numbers?
I didn't even know Northridge survived the '94 quake.
Don't worry about that.
You with Vinnie?
Be very cool.
Do not get him excited, but the first West Coast numbers are in,
- and they're big.
- Go on.
- Eight-legs big, bitch.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The webcrawler is in our sights, Eric, and I want to squash that fucker!
So do I, Ari.
All right, thanks.
What?
Nothing.
- Fuck you, nothing.
What?
- Not until it's official, right?
Fuck official.
I don't want you to know anything I don't.
Is it Spider-Man?
- Spidey, E?
- Say something, dick.
Speak now or I'm throwing you out of the car.
Spider-Man is in our sights.
I knew it!
Fuck you, Tobey!
- It's not definite though, Vince.
- Yeah, I know.
Cool.
Let's buy some toys anyway to celebrate.
I know a place.
But not in the Valley.
They got toys in the city, Vince.
How do you know this area, Turtle?
Best rub-and-tug in California was next door.
They probably moved to Santa Monica where it's cool.
There she is.
- Ducatis.
- Sweet.
This is the one for me, Vince, the fastest production bike on the road.
It's yours.
I appreciate it, but I'm not a motorcycle guy, and I'm not gonna take a gift just to take it.
You neither, Johnny?
- You know I hate rice rockets, Vince.
- Ducati's Italian.
Regardless, it's still a foreign job.
I'm a Harley man.
Didn't you have one when you came here?
Yeah, I had to hock it to Michael Madsen after a couple of bleak pilot seasons.
God, I loved that bike.
Why don't we go and make him an offer he can't refuse?
You serious?
God, you're a fucking prince, bro.
You know, he's also got a watch of mine.
Mr Chase, have you decided yet?
Yes, we have.
We'll take four of these.
Maybe you guys will grow to love 'em.
Not again.
So when is the last time you had sex?
- With each other or...
- If you're not taking this seriously...
I am.
It's just, for the money we're spending,
I could get you a pro to service your most bizarre fetishes.
- See?
This is what I'm dealing with.
- Come on.
Don't.
It's Vince.
Don't you feel that a lacking sexual relationship is a big problem in a marriage?
I do, Doc, but we fuck more than any other married couple you know.
And I know this because, whenever we go out with another married couple and the subject comes up, they always say, "I can't believe how often you guys fuck".
- It's Vince, baby.
- I don't give a fuck.
You know, after the year that I've had and on the most important day of my life, you'd think that she would ask me what I wanted?
A nice blow job, perhaps, where I could just sit back for the first time in nine months and do nothing but admire the top of her head and pray that this fucking movie opens so I can stop selling off assets like we're fucking Michael Jackson.
I have to answer the Batphone when it rings three fucking times and it's fucking Vince, OK?
Eric, speak.
There's been another blackout in the Valley.
You need a fucking night-light?
Get back over the hill.
And don't call me back unless...
- Fuck me.
- What's going on, Ari?
I'm gonna call you back.
Can we prorate this session, please?
- He's gonna call us back.
- Anything to worry about?
Great.
We're being stalked by Devo.
- This isn't a coincidence.
- No, we followed you.
- Replenish.
- We wanted to know if you guys wanted to come to a party.
It's our big graduation bash.
High school party?
Sorry, kid, we don't go to parties where the girls ain't legal.
Although we do like 'em barely legal.
Come on, Vince, come with us.
It'll be like Almost Famous.
- Hey, I like that movie.
- Vince, I'm burning up here.
Another hour and my kidneys may shut down.
They've got a pool.
- Really?
- Yeah, it'll be great.
It'll be a lot easier to get in with you there, Vince.
So that's it?
You guys need Vince to get you into the party.
Turtle, you still can't get into Teddy's without Vince.
- Do you wanna go?
- Fuck it.
It'll take hours to get home anyway.
So you'll come?
- Yeah, we'll come.
- All right!
Aquaman to the rescue!
Did kids look this young when we went to school?
- In Drama's eighth year they did.
- Six years, assholes.
And like I did for these maggots, I'll do for you.
Someone gives you guys a hard time about being here,
Johnny Drama's got your back.
Thanks.
There are some really tough kids at this school.
Come on, I'm from New York.
Who the fuck let nerds in my house?
- Here we go.
- Drama's gonna get his ass kicked.
- Hey, Kessler.
- Who let you losers in?
- These guys are with us.
- Who the fuck are you?
He's my brother.
Sorry, we were just passing by, we saw the party, we figured we'd drop in.
Holy shit.
You're Vince Chase.
You're with these two?
Jay and Reggie?
They're my cousins.
It's cool.
We'll find another party.
Oh, no.
No, you stay.
Reggie and Jay, stay.
This old guy, he can stay too.
- You need a beer, Vince?
- That'd be good.
- Thanks.
- Holy shit, Vince Chase.
Hey, everyone, fuckin' Aquaman is at my house!
Give me something good, Ari.
There's nothing good at all, E. Nothing good.
- Why?
What's happening?
- Massive, rolling blackouts from the heat.
They're hitting the whole fucking coast from San Francisco down to San Diego.
Shit.
Well, I guess we can kiss Spider-Man goodbye.
Forget Spider-Man.
I just named two of the most populated cities in the whole country.
- So what does that mean, Ari?
- That we are fucked.
We took a massive hit on the midday numbers and now they are projecting 85.
Jesus Christ.
What am I gonna tell Vince?
What you've been saying all day.
Nothing!
Keep your mouth shut until it's official.
- When's that gonna be?
- In a few hours, all right?
I want you to email me your address and I will come and tell him with you, all right?
What happened to the music?
It's a blackout, baby!
Into the pool!
Our moms say Reggie looked exactly like I did when I was his age.
You don't see it?
- A little, I guess.
- And you're related to Jay too?
We're practically like brothers.
You girls should take care of these two.
I'm gonna get a drink.
Want anything?
- All good, Vince.
- Good to hear it, Reggie.
Jay.
Life is good!
Any word?
- No, nothing official.
- What does that mean?
An hour ago we're the biggest opening ever, and now we're a disaster?
Yeah, well, fucking blackouts.
Fucking blackouts.
This is why I don't like to get caught up in this shit.
- You shouldn't let me get caught up in it.
- Come on.
I know, I know.
I asked.
I'm sorry, buddy.
Look at these kids.
This used to be us.
We used to talk about coming to Hollywood.
- It wasn't about money.
- No, it wasn't.
Fuck it.
We're not gonna let this town make it about money now.
- Let's get hammered.
- With 17-year-olds?
- We'll make their night.
- All right.
Blackouts?
Fucking blackouts?
Thank you very much!
The town will understand, Ari.
It's not the movie's fault.
Baby, it wasn't the Cubs' fault when that douchebag grabbed the foul ball either, but they still don't get a World Series ring.
There are no asterisks in this life, only scoreboards, and ours is currently reading "Fucked".
There's nothing you can do about it now, so why don't you sit down and relax?
I can't relax until I tell Vinnie.
I gotta go to the Valley.
After the call.
And who knows when that will be?
Isn't it a bit convenient the kids are at your mother's?
Ari, I've been patient, but now, whatever happens is totally out of your control.
So let's go upstairs.
Fine, but I'm not gonna like it.
Oh, really?
All right, I may like it just a little bit.
I don't want you to hear this.
I could cry.
I have to go to the Valley.
I promise, when I get back, no matter what, we'll dent that headboard.
I guarantee you, you will not walk right tomorrow.
Tell me something good.
So you work with Vince?
Is it fun?
You don't talk much.
Not to high school girls.
No offence.
I'm not in high school.
This is my little brother's party.
I'm just chaperoning.
That was a real creepy turn.
You may have a couple pounds on me but nothing outweighs experience.
You ready?
Are you ready?
Hey, everybody!
Do you know how good your lives are right now?
My boys are here from high school and we wish we could be back living like this!
- What the fuck is he doing?
- He wanted his Almost Famous moment.
- I told you not to say anything till it was official.
- What the fuck is the difference?
Ari is in the Valley?
Holy shit, we really must be fucked, huh?
What are they projecting now?
45, Ari?
- 116, actually.
- What?
- 116, kid!
- How's that possible?
You guys ever hear of a hanging chad?
Where the fuck am I?
Listen, the biggest thing the blackouts affected were the actual reporting of the numbers.
- We beat Spider-Man?
- It's only Friday, but if there isn't a tornado in the Midwest, we've got a good shot, my friend.
Hey, everybody, you've got the biggest movie star on the planet on your roof right now.
It's all you, baby!
- Number one, baby.
- Yeah!
Do it!
So, whose dad is this?
I don't know.
Why don't you throw him in the pool?
Fuck you, throw me in the pool.
Hey, Kong, go get us some beers.
- Put him in!
Put him in!
- Go, go!
You little fuck, these are $900 shoes!
You guys are not gonna believe this!
Those two girls?
The most untouchable girls in school.
But guess what?
They like you.
They wanna hang in my basement.
Basement!
Nice!
But we can't all fit on the Vespa.
You can't roll chicks in a Vespa, bro.
We were hoping maybe you could give us a lift.
A lift?
I can't do that.
But what I can do is this.
Turtle, give our new best friends the keys to the Mas'.
There you go.
That is so cool!
You're lending us your car?
- No.
- How do we get it back to you?
You don't.
You return it to the Beverly Hills Maserati dealership.
Your lease ends at the end of August.
- No way.
- Holy shit.
That was actually refreshing, but I have to go home to hammer the wife.
Give us a lift.
Anything to keep me away from my house.
Come on, bro.
We out.
The Valley ain't so bad.
English
Why, Ari, why?
- I'm in bed, E. Talk dirty to me.
- It's five in the morning.
- What are you wearing?
- Fuck you.
I love it when you say "fuck." Say it again.
Come on, E. It's game day, buddy.
Wake up.
This is our tradition.
Only this time, we're playing for keeps.
No Pixar squirrel is going to stop us.
It's number one or bust, kid.
- You sound confident.
- Not a worry in the world.
- So what are we hoping for?
- 95 mil is what they're projecting.
- And what's good?
- 95 mil, Eric.
That would be good.
Expectations.
Beat 'em by a dollar, great.
Under by a dollar, put a gun in your mouth and make sure I'm behind you.
OK, keep in touch, Ari.
Game day, baby.
No go, no go.
- You'll talk dirty to E...
- Come on.
- It's been three weeks.
- I know.
Just after we open, baby.
Then we're all good.
And if we don't open?
If we don't open?
If we don't open?
What do you mean by that?
Would you say that to a fighter? "You may get knocked out.
See you if you're not in a coma"?
Don't jinx this, baby.
Not today.
Three soft-boiled eggs, boiled chicken, wheat toast with jam.
It's not a signature Johnny Drama breakfast, but nothing will upset your stomach.
- Thanks, Johnny, but I'm not stressed.
- You're hiding it, bro.
This is a big one.
You may not know you're stressed but trust me, you are stressed.
Moviefone says there's at 2:30 in Northridge.
The Valley?
What are you, crazy?
Lt'll reach 100 degrees in the city today.
Vince wants to go to an out-of-the-way place.
Vince, you know my policy.
Except for work, I only go to the Valley November through March.
Even then, only the sushi row.
Come on, Johnny, go for me.
- I'd better hydrate.
- What do you think we'll open at, Vin?
- Oh, God.
- Come on.
I don't play this game.
Let's fuck around a little.
Pick a number.
- Stop freaking him out.
- I'm not freaking out.
I know we'll open.
It's a foregone conclusion.
I'm not worried.
- So pick a number.
- OK.
50 million.
- Would that be good?
- That would be terrible, Vince.
- Really?
- This movie opens at $50 million,
- we're working at Del Taco on Monday.
- What do we need?
- The studio's projecting 95.
- 95?
Nice.
Fuck 95.
I got a little projection of my own.
114,844, 117.
- How is that?
- $1 more than Spider-Man made.
We do any less, I'll consider the movie a flop.
Idiot.
Spider-Man is the biggest movie opening ever.
Plus Spider-Man had a much bigger fan base than Aquaman to begin with.
Can't happen.
We got James Cameron.
And those eyes.
It can happen.
- Think we got a shot to topple Spidey, E?
- Let's just topple 95.
I'll tell you what, if we do beat Spider-Man, y'all are getting something sick, know that.
- How sick?
- What do you mean by sick?
It's all in there.
Listen...
- It's not even ten and it's burning up out there.
- I know.
My widget says it's 96 already.
What's a widget?
Why are you sitting like that?
- Are you wearing a butt plug?
- No!
I brought you this for luck on the opening today.
What is this, a little Tae Bo instructor?
That is an authentic 12th-century Yong Shi warrior, Ari.
A Mongolian symbol of strength.
If you carry him, you cannot be stopped.
This is Hollywood.
The only thing Mongolian is barbecue, but thanks.
And...
I got you in with Dr Marcus at 4:30.
- Dr Marcus?
- Yeah.
Your wife called and said she needed an emergency session.
Why didn't you tell her I didn't have time?
- Because you do have time.
- Why didn't you lie?
Cos I'm scared of your wife, Ari.
Yeah, me too.
Maybe if I rub this little guy's balls, she'll disappear.
We're going to the Valley, Drama, not the Sahara.
Don't kid yourself, E. North of Ventura Boulevard is Hell's waiting room.
Be prepared.
We'll have to stop every 20 feet for you to take a leak.
That's what the empties are for.
Don't even think about pulling your dick out in my car.
Aquaman's making waves, pal.
The first East Coast numbers are in.
They're projecting 100 mil.
That is great news.
The movie gods are smiling on us today.
It's still early.
We can do better, right?
I thought I was greedy.
The over-and-under is 95.
We hit 100, I got wood.
I'm just saying.
I mean, Spider-Man did what, 114?
- Is there any way we can beat that?
- Spider-Man?
Who said anything about Spider-Man?
Eric.
Tell me that Vinnie doesn't think we'll beat the biggest opening in movie history.
I'll tell you what.
Manage your client's expectations.
Do your job.
Thank you for ruining my day.
We all good?
- I thought you're not worried about that stuff.
- I'm not.
I don't wanna know anything till it's official.
- Can't we know?
- Let's roll.
103...
My God.
- 104!
- Unbelievable.
- Shit.
- 105.
- Eat that, Drama.
- Inhuman.
I guess it's true, the heat really does affect the elderly.
Yeah, Drama, I haven't seen somebody sweat like that since Patrick Ewing retired.
Great Mother of God.
- Fuck.
Dude, we got a monster, Vince.
- It's one theatre.
Don't get crazy.
- How will we get seats?
- Who are you talking to?
There's four taped off for us in the back as we speak.
And all it cost us... was a signed copy of the new Aquaman game.
Nice job, Turtle.
I'm making a run for cooler pastures.
What do you think?
They're loving it.
Wait till they get a load of the end of this scene.
Christ, where's this jerkoff going?
Hey, pal.
You wanna sit down?
You're about to miss the best part of the movie.
I have to use the bathroom.
Sit down.
I dropped my monkey!
No, come back!
Here it comes!
- What the fuck?
- Shit, projector must have gone out.
It's not just the projector.
We lost the central air.
...waiting for two hours!
Sorry, folks.
It's a blackout.
Please calmly file into the lobby and we'll refund your money.
Refund their money?
They already saw half the movie.
Fuck that.
- Shut the fuck up!
- Give them free popcorn!
- Holy crap!
Aquaman!
- Dude, what are you doing here?
- Just checking out the movie like you guys.
- Who's guarding the throne of Poseidonis?
It's about to be a madhouse here.
- I'm gonna go get the car.

The movie's great.

That harpoon fight was badass.

Animatronic.
Yes!
You owe me 20.
That is him!
- My God!
- Can I have your autograph, Vince?
We made it.
Now, let's get back to civilisation.
Please.
I begged you to take the 101, but you had to take the Canyon.
- It's more scenic.
- Just get me home, please.
All the lights are out, Drama.
What shall I do?
You know, it looks like the whole area is blacked out.
I'm gonna call Ari.
Hey, I was just dialling you.
That must mean we're destined to be in love.
Yeah.
You having a blackout too?
Not since I took four Quaaludes and forgot I fucked Chantal Lautenberg.
Why?
We're in Northridge.
It's blacked out.

Don't worry about that.

A nice blow job, perhaps, where I could just sit back for the first time in nine months and do nothing but admire the top of her head and pray that this fucking movie opens so I can stop selling off assets like we're fucking Michael Jackson.
I have to answer the Batphone when it rings three fucking times and it's fucking Vince, OK?
Eric, speak.
There's been another blackout in the Valley.
You need a fucking night-light?
Get back over the hill.

- Hey, Kessler.
- Who let you losers in?
- These guys are with us.
- Who the fuck are you?
He's my brother.
Sorry, we were just passing by, we saw the party, we figured we'd drop in.
Holy shit.
You're Vince Chase.
You're with these two?
Jay and Reggie?
They're my cousins.
It's cool.
We'll find another party.
Oh, no.
No, you stay.
Reggie and Jay, stay.
This old guy, he can stay too.
- You need a beer, Vince?
- That'd be good.
- Thanks.
- Holy shit, Vince Chase.
Hey, everyone, fuckin' Aquaman is at my house!
Give me something good, Ari.
There's nothing good at all, E. Nothing good.
- Why?
What's happening?
- Massive, rolling blackouts from the heat.
They're hitting the whole fucking coast from San Francisco down to San Diego.
Shit.
Well, I guess we can kiss Spider-Man goodbye.
Forget Spider-Man.
I just named two of the most populated cities in the whole country.
- So what does that mean, Ari?
- That we are fucked.
We took a massive hit on the midday numbers and now they are projecting 85.
Jesus Christ.
What am I gonna tell Vince?
What you've been saying all day.
Nothing!
Keep your mouth shut until it's official.
- When's that gonna be?
- In a few hours, all right?
I want you to email me your address and I will come and tell him with you, all right?
What happened to the music?
It's a blackout, baby!
Into the pool!
Our moms say Reggie looked exactly like I did when I was his age.
You don't see it?
- A little, I guess.
- And you're related to Jay too?
We're practically like brothers.
You girls should take care of these two.
I'm gonna get a drink.
Want anything?
- All good, Vince.
- Good to hear it, Reggie.
Jay.
Life is good!
Any word?
- No, nothing official.
- What does that mean?
An hour ago we're the biggest opening ever, and now we're a disaster?
Yeah, well, fucking blackouts.
Fucking blackouts.
This is why I don't like to get caught up in this shit.
- You shouldn't let me get caught up in it.
- Come on.
I know, I know.
I asked.
I'm sorry, buddy.
Look at these kids.
This used to be us.
We used to talk about coming to Hollywood.
- It wasn't about money.
- No, it wasn't.
Fuck it.
We're not gonna let this town make it about money now.
- Let's get hammered.
- With 17-year-olds?
- We'll make their night.
- All right.
Blackouts?
Fucking blackouts?
Thank you very much!
The town will understand, Ari.
It's not the movie's fault.
Baby, it wasn't the Cubs' fault when that douchebag grabbed the foul ball either, but they still don't get a World Series ring.
There are no asterisks in this life, only scoreboards, and ours is currently reading "Fucked".
There's nothing you can do about it now, so why don't you sit down and relax?
I can't relax until I tell Vinnie.
I gotta go to the Valley.
After the call.
And who knows when that will be?
Isn't it a bit convenient the kids are at your mother's?
Ari, I've been patient, but now, whatever happens is totally out of your control.
So let's go upstairs.
Fine, but I'm not gonna like it.
Oh, really?
All right, I may like it just a little bit.
I don't want you to hear this.
I could cry.
I have to go to the Valley.
I promise, when I get back, no matter what, we'll dent that headboard.
I guarantee you, you will not walk right tomorrow.
Tell me something good.
So you work with Vince?
Is it fun?
You don't talk much.
Not to high school girls.
No offence.
I'm not in high school.
This is my little brother's party.
I'm just chaperoning.
That was a real creepy turn.
You may have a couple pounds on me but nothing outweighs experience.
You ready?
Are you ready?
Hey, everybody!
Do you know how good your lives are right now?
My boys are here from high school and we wish we could be back living like this!
- What the fuck is he doing?
- He wanted his Almost Famous moment.
- I told you not to say anything till it was official.
- What the fuck is the difference?
Ari is in the Valley?
Holy shit, we really must be fucked, huh?
What are they projecting now?
45, Ari?
- 116, actually.
- What?
- 116, kid!
- How's that possible?
You guys ever hear of a hanging chad?
Where the fuck am I?
Listen, the biggest thing the blackouts affected were the actual reporting of the numbers.
- We beat Spider-Man?
- It's only Friday, but if there isn't a tornado in the Midwest, we've got a good shot, my friend.
Hey, everybody, you've got the biggest movie star on the planet on your roof right now.
It's all you, baby!
- Number one, baby.
- Yeah!
Do it!
So, whose dad is this?
I don't know.
Why don't you throw him in the pool?
Fuck you, throw me in the pool.
Hey, Kong, go get us some beers.
- Put him in!
Put him in!
- Go, go!
You little fuck, these are $900 shoes!
You guys are not gonna believe this!
Those two girls?
The most untouchable girls in school.
But guess what?
They like you.
They wanna hang in my basement.
Basement!
Nice!
But we can't all fit on the Vespa.
You can't roll chicks in a Vespa, bro.
We were hoping maybe you could give us a lift.
A lift?
I can't do that.
But what I can do is this.
Turtle, give our new best friends the keys to the Mas'.
There you go.
That is so cool!
You're lending us your car?
- No.
- How do we get it back to you?
You don't.
You return it to the Beverly Hills Maserati dealership.
Your lease ends at the end of August.
- No way.
- Holy shit.
That was actually refreshing, but I have to go home to hammer the wife.
Give us a lift.
Anything to keep me away from my house.
Come on, bro.
We out.
The Valley ain't so bad.
English
ONE DAY IN THE VALLEY
Why, Ari, why?
- I'm in bed, E. Talk dirty to me.
- It's 5:00 in the morning.
- What are you wearing?
- Fuck you.
I love it when you say "fuck." Say it again.
Come on, E. It's game day, buddy.
Wake up.
This is our tradition.
Only this time we're playing for keeps.
No Pixar squirrel is going to stop us.
It's number one or bust, kid.
- You sound confident.
- Not a worry in the world.
So what are we hoping for?
$95 mil is what they're projecting.
- And what's good?
- $95 mil, Eric.
That would be good.
Expectations: you beat 'em by a dollar-- life is great;
Under by a dollar-- put a gun in your mouth and make sure I'm standing behind you.
Okay, keep in touch, Ari.
Game day, baby.
No go, no go.
You'll talk dirty to E...
Come on.
- It's been three weeks.
- I know, I know.
Just after we open, baby.
Then we're all good.
And if we don't open?
"If we don't open?" What-- no, no, no.
"If we don't open?" What do you mean by that?
Would you say that to a fighter on the morning of a bout?
"Maybe you'll get knocked out.
"See you after the fight if you're not in a coma"?
Don't jinx this, baby.
Not today.
Three soft-boiled eggs, boiled chicken, wheat toast with jam.
It's not a signature Johnny Drama breakfast but there's nothing there to upset your stomach.
Thanks, Johnny, but I'm not stressed.
You're hiding it, bro.
This is a big one.
You may not know you're stressed but trust me, you are stressed.
Moviefone says there's at 2:30 in Northridge.
The Valley?
What, are you crazy?
It's gonna reach 100° in the city today.
Vince wants to go to an out-of-the-way place.
Vince, you know my policy-- except for work,
I only go to the Valley November through March.
And even then-- only the sushi row.
Come on, Johnny, go for me.
I'd better hydrate.
So what do you think we're gonna open at, vin?
- Oh, God.
- Come on.
I don't play this game.
Come on, let's just fuck around a little.
Pick a number.
- Stop freaking him out, Turtle.
- I'm not freaking out.
I know we're gonna open.
It's a foregone conclusion.
- I'm not worried about it.
- So pick a number.
Okay.
$50 million.
Huh?
- Would that be good?
- That would be terrible, Vince.
- Really?
- This movie opens at $50 million, we're all working at Del Taco come Monday.
- So what do we need?
- The studio's projecting 95.
95?
Nice.
Fuck 95.
I got a little projection of my own.
$114,844,117.
- How is that?
- $1 more than "Spider-Man" made.
We do any less than that I'll personally consider the movie a flop.
You're an idiot, Turtle. "Spider-Man" is the biggest movie opening ever.
Plus Spider-Man had a much bigger fan base than Aquaman to begin with.
Can't happen.
We got James Cameron.
And those eyes.
It can happen.
You think we got a shot to topple Spidey, E?
Let's just topple 95, huh, guys?
I'll tell you what:
if we do beat "Spider-Man"
y'all are getting something sick.
Know that.
- How sick?
- What do you mean by "sick"?
It's not even 10:00 A.M. and it's burning up out there.
I know.
My widget says it's 96° already.
What the fuck's a widget?
Why are you sitting like that?
Seriously, what, are you wearing a butt plug?
No.
I brought you this for luck on the opening today.
What is this, a little Tae Bo instructor?
That is an authentic 12th century Yong Shi warrior, Ari.
He's the Mongolian symbol of strength.
If you carry him, you cannot be stopped.
This is Hollywood, Lloyd.
The only thing Mongolian is barbeque,
- but thanks.
I'll take what I can get.
- Oh, and...
I got you in with Dr. Marcus at 4:30.
Dr. Marcus?
Um, yeah.
Your wife called and said she needed an emergency session.
Fuck, Lloyd, why didn't you just tell her that I didn't have time?
- Because you do have time.
- Why didn't you lie?
Cause I'm scared of your wife, Ari.
Yeah, me too.
Maybe if I rub this little guy's balls she'll disappear.
We're going to the Valley, Drama, not the Sahara.
Hey, don't kid yourself, E. North of Ventura Boulevard is hell's waiting room.
Be prepared.
If you keep drinking we're gonna have to stop every 20' for you to take a leak.
That's what the empties are for.
Don't even think about pulling your dick out in my car, Drama.
- Hey, Ari.
- "Aquaman" is making waves, pal.
The first east coast numbers are in.
They're projecting $100 mil.
Oh, that is great news.
The movie gods are smiling on us today.
Well, it's still early.
We could do better, right?
I thought I was greedy.
Listen, the over-and-under is 95.
We hit 100-- I got wood.
I'm just saying.
I mean, "Spider-Man" did what, 114?
- Is there any way we can beat that?
- "Spider-Man"?
Who-- who's said anything about "Spider-Man"?
Eric... tell me that Vinnie doesn't think that we're gonna beat the biggest opening in movie history.
I'll tell you what:
manage your client's expectations.
Do your job.
Thank you for ruining my day.
Ari?
We all good?
I thought you're not worried about that stuff.
I'm not.
In fact, I don't wanna know anything till it's official.
- Can't we know?
- Let's roll.
103...
- My God.
- 104!
- Unbelievable.
- Shit.
- 105.
- Eat that, Drama.
- This is inhuman.
- Yeah, I guess it's true what they say.
The heat really does affect the elderly.
Yeah, seriously, Drama, 'cause I haven't seen somebody sweat like that since Patrick Ewing retired.
Great mother of God.
Fuck.
Dude, we got a monster, Vince.
It's one theater.
Don't get crazy.
How are we gonna get seats?
Who are you talking to?
There's four taped off for us in the back as we speak.
And all it cost us... was a signed copy of the new Aquaman game.
Nice job, Turtle.
I'm making a run for cooler pastures.
What do you think?
Oh, they're loving it.
Wait till they get a load of the end of this scene.
Jesus Christ, where's this jerkoff going?
Hey, pal-- you wanna sit down?
You're about to miss the best part of the whole movie.
I have to use the bathroom.
Sit down.
I dropped my monkey!
No, come back!
Here it comes!
What the fuck?
Shit, the projector must have gone out.
It's not just the projector.
We lost the central air.
...waiting for this movie two hours!
Ahem, sorry, folks.
It's a blackout.
Um, please calmly file into the lobby and we'll refund your money.
Whoa, whoa.
Refund their money?
They already saw half the movie.
Fuck that.
Shut the fuck up!
Give them some free popcorn or something.
Holy crap!
Aquaman!
Dude, what are you doing here?
Just checking out the movie like you guys.
Oh, but who's guarding the throne of Poseidonis?
It's about to be a madhouse in here.
- I'm gonna go get the car, all right?
- Fire up the AC.
The movie is great, Vince.
We caught the 10:00 A.M. showing too.
That harpoon fight was badass.
Did you hear that, E?
They thought I was badass.
- I heard.
- Hey, so Vince, let me ask you-- was that seahorse you rode animatronic or computer generated?
- E?
- Animatronic.
- Animatronic.
- Yes!
You owe me $20.
That is him!
- Oh my God!
- Can I have your autograph, Vince?
Whoo!
We made it.
Now let's get back to civilization.
Please.
I begged you to take the 101, but you had to take the canyon.
- It's more scenic.
- Just get me home, please.
All the lights are out, Drama.
What would you like me to do?
You know, it looks like the whole area is blacked out.
I'm gonna call Ari.
Hey, I was just dialing you.
Hey.
That must mean that we're destined to be in love.
Yeah.
You're having a blackout over there too?
I haven't had a blackout since I took four quaaludes
And forgot I fucked Chantal Lautenberg.
Why?
Cause we're in Northridge.
The whole area is blacked out.
- Is this gonna affect the numbers?
- I didn't even know that Northridge survived the '94 quake, E.
Don't worry about that.
Listen, you with Vinnie?
Yeah.
Okay, be very cool.
Do not get him excited, but the first west coast numbers are in,
- and they're big.
- Go on.
- Eight-legs big, bitch.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The webcrawler is in our sights, Eric, and I want to squash that fucker!
So do I, Ari.
All right, thanks.
What?
Nothing.
Fuck you, "nothing." What is it?
Nothing until it's official, right, Vince?
Fuck official.
I don't want you to know anything I don't.
- Is it "Spider-Man"?
- Spidey, E?
- Say something, dick.
- E, speak now or I'm throwing you out of the car.
"Spider-Man" is in our sights.
Yes!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Yes!
- I knew it!
Fuck you, Tobey!
- It's not definite though, Vince.
- Yeah, no, I know.
That's cool.
Let's go buy some toys anyway to celebrate.
- Yes.
- I know a place.
But not in the Valley, right?
They got toys in the city, Vince.
How do you know this area, Turtle?
Best rub-and-tug in California used to be next door.
Yeah, they probably moved to Santa Monica where it's cool.
There she is.
Ducatis.
Sweet.
This is the one for me, Vince, the fastest production bike on the road.
It's yours.
E?
I appreciate it, Vince, but I'm not a motorcycle guy, and I'm not gonna take a gift just to take one.
You neither, Johnny?
You know I hate rice rockets, Vince.
Ducati's Italian, Drama.
Yeah, well, regardless it's still a foreign job.
I'm a Harley man.
Yeah, didn't you have one when you first came out here?
Yeah, I had to hock it to Michael Madsen after a couple of bleak pilot seasons.
God, I loved that bike.
Why don't we go over there tomorrow
- and make him an offer he can't refuse?
- You serious?
God, you're a fucking prince, bro.
You know, he's also got a watch of mine.
Mr. Chase, have you decided yet?
Yes, we have.
We'll take four of these.
Maybe you guys will grow to love 'em.
Not again.
So when is the last time you had sex?
With each other or...?
If you're not gonna take this seriously, Ari--
I'm taking it seriously.
It's just for the money we're spending here I could get you a pro to service your even most bizarre fetishes.
Okay, you see?
This is what I'm dealing with.
- Come on.
- Don't.
- It's Vince.
- Ari don't you feel that a lacking sexual relationship is a big problem in a marriage?
Oh, I do, doc, but we fuck more than any other married couple you know.
And I know this because whenever we go out with another married couple and the subject comes up they always say, "I can't believe how often you guys fuck."
- It's Vince, baby.
- I don't give a fuck.
Okay-- you know, uh, after the year that I've had and on the most important day of my life you'd think that she would ask me what I wanted, you know?
A nice blowjob, perhaps, where I could just sit back for the first time in nine months and do nothing but admire the top of her head and pray that this fucking movie opens so I can stop selling off assets
like we're fucking Michael Jackson.
Now I have to answer the fucking batphone when it rings three fucking times and it's fucking Vince, okay?
So...
- Eric, speak.
- Ari-- there's been another blackout in a different part of the Valley.
You need a fucking night-light or something?
Get back over the hill, okay?
And don't call me back unless--
Fuck me.
- What's going on, Ari?
- I'm gonna call you back.
Can we prorate this session, please?
- He's gonna call us back.
- Anything to worry about?
- Hey, Aquaman.
- Oh, great.
We're being stalked by devo.
- This isn't a coincidence, is it?
- No, we followed you.
- Replenish.
- We, uh, wanted to know if you guys wanted to come to a party.
It's our big graduation bash.
High school party?
Sorry, kid, we don't go to the parties where the girls ain't legal.
Although we do like 'em barely legal.
Come on, Vince, come with us.
It'll be like "Almost Famous."
- Hey, I like that movie.
- Vince, I'm burning up out here.
Another hour and my kidneys may shut down.
They've got a pool.
- Really?
- Yeah, it'll be great.
And it'll be a lot easier to get in with you there, Vince.
So that's it?
You guys need Vince to get you into the party.
What are you laughing at, Turtle?
You still can't get into teddy's without Vince.
Do you wanna go?
Fuck it.
It's gonna take hours to get home anyway, right?
So you'll come?
- Yeah, we'll come.
- All right!
Aquaman to the rescue!
- Hey, girl.
- Hey!
Did kids look this young when we went to high school?
- In Drama's eighth year they did, yes.
- Six years, assholes.
Ad just like I did for these maggots I'm gonna do for you guys.
Someone gives you guys a hard time about being here--
Johnny Drama's got your back.
Thanks.
There are some really tough kids at this school.
Come on, I'm from New York.
Who the fuck let nerds in my house?
- Here we go.
- Jesus...
Drama's gonna get his ass kicked by a 16-year-old.
- Hey, Kessler.
- Who let you losers in?
- These guys are with us.
- Yeah?
Who the fuck are you?
Uh, he's my brother.
Sorry, we were just passing by, we saw the party, we figured we'd drop in.
Whoa, whoa, holy shit.
You're Vince Chase.
You're with these two?
Jay and Reggie?
Yeah, they're my cousins.
But hey, it's cool.
We'll find another party.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, you stay.
Reggie and Jay, stay.
This old guy, he can stay too.
Uh, you need a beer, Vince?
That'd be good.
Thanks.
Holy shit, Vince Chase.
Hey everyone, fuckin' Aquaman is at my house!
Give me something good, Ari.
There's nothing good at all, E. Nothing good.
- Why?
What's happening?
- There are massive rolling blackouts from the heat.
They're hitting the whole fucking coast from San Francisco down to San Diego.
Shit.
Well, I guess we can kiss "Spider-Man" goodbye.
Forget "Spider-Man." I just named two of the most populated cities in the whole fucking country.
- So what does that mean, Ari?
- It means that we are fucked.
We took a massive hit on the midday numbers and now they are projecting 85.
Jesus Christ.
What am I gonna tell Vince?
Same thing you've been telling him all day-- nothing!
Keep your mouth shut until it's official.
Yeah, when's that gonna be?
It's gonna be in a few hours, all right?
I want you to email me your address and I will come and tell him with you, all right?
Lloyd!
What happened to the music?
It's a blackout, baby!
Into the pool!
Yeah, our moms say Reggie looked exactly like I did when I was his age.
You don't see it?
- A little, I guess.
- And you're related to Jay too?
Oh, we're practically like brothers.
You girls should take care of these two.
I'm gonna get a drink.
You want anything?
All good, Vince.
- Good to hear it, Reggie.
- Jay.
Ha-ha!
Life is good, huh?
Any word?
- No, nothing official.
- What does that mean?
How is this possible?
An hour ago we're the biggest opening ever
- and now we're a disaster?
- Yeah, well, fucking blackouts.
Fucking blackouts.
See, this is why I don't like to get caught up in this shit.
You shouldn't let me get caught up in it, E.
- Vince, come on.
- I know, I know.
I asked.
I'm sorry, buddy.
Yeah.
Look at these kids.
This used to be us.
Remember how we used to talk about coming out to Hollywood?
- It wasn't about money.
- No, it wasn't.
Fuck it.
We're not gonna let this town make it about money now.
- Let's get hammered.
- With 17-year-olds?
- We'll make their night.
- All right.
Blackouts?
Fucking blackouts?
Thank you very much!
The town will understand, Ari.
It's not the movie's fault.
Baby, it wasn't the Cubs' fault when that douche bag grabbed the foul ball either, but they still don't get a World Series ring.
There are no asterisks in this life, only scoreboards, and ours is currently reading "fucked."
Well, there's nothing you can do about it now, so why don't you sit down and relax?
Baby, I can't relax until I tell Vinnie.
I gotta go to the Valley.
After the call.
And who knows when that will be?
Baby, isn't it a little convenient that the kids are at your mother's?
Ari, I've been patient, but now whatever happens is totally out of your control.
So let's go upstairs.
Fine, but I'm not gonna like it.
Oh really?
All right, I may like it just a little bit.
Baby, I don't want you to hear this.
I could cry.
I have to go to the Valley.
I promise you when I get back, no matter what, we're gonna dent that headboard.
No bullshit.
I guarantee you you will not walk right tomorrow.
Tell me something good.
Vince, Vince, Vince, Vince!
- So you work with Vince?
- Yep.
- Is it fun?
- Yep.
You don't talk much, huh?
Not to high school girls, sweetheart.
No offense.
I'm not in high school.
This is my little brother's party.
I'm just chaperoning.
Ew.
That was a real creepy turn.
You may have a couple pounds on me but nothing outweighs experience.
You ready?
Are you ready?
Hey, everybody!
Do you know how good your lives are right now?
Yeah!
My boys are here from high school and we wish we could be back living like this!
Yeah!
What the fuck is he doing?
He wanted his "Almost Famous" moment.
I told you not to tell him anything until it was official.
Aw, what the fuck is the difference, Ari?
Hey, Vinnie!
Ari is in the Valley?
Holy shit, we really must be fucked, huh?
What are they projecting now?
45, Ari?
- 116, actually.
- What?
- 116, kid!
- How's that possible?
You guys ever hear of a hanging chad?
Where the fuck am I?
Listen, the biggest thing the blackouts affected were the actual reporting of the numbers.
- We beat "Spider-Man"?
- Well, it's only Friday, but if there isn't a tornado in the Midwest
I think we've got a good goddamn shot, my friend.
Hey, everybody, you've got the biggest movie star on the planet on your roof right now.
It's all you, baby!
- Number one, baby.
- Yeah!
Do it!
So whose dad is this?
I don't know.
Why don't you throw him in the pool?
Fuck you, "throw me in the pool."
Hey, Kong, go get us some beers.
- Put him in!
Put him in!
- Go, go!
Hey, you little fuck, these are $900 shoes!
Okay, you guys are not gonna believe this!
Those two girls you introduced us to?
The most untouchable girls in school.
But guess what--
They like you.
They wanna hang in my basement.
Basement!
Nice!
The only problem is, we can't all fit on the Vespa.
You can't roll chicks in a Vespa, bro.
Well, we were hoping maybe you could give us a lift.
- A lift?
- Yeah, right.
I can't do that.
But what I can do is this:
Turtle, give our new best friends
- the keys to the Mas'.
- There you go.
Oh, that is so cool!
You're lending us your car?
- My car.
- How do we get it back to you?
You don't.
You return it to the Beverly Hills Maserati dealership.
Your lease ends at the end of August.
- No way.
- Holy shit.
That was actually refreshing, but I have to go home to hammer the wife.
Give us a lift.
Anything to keep me away from my house.
Come on, bro.
We out.
Yeah, the Valley ain't so bad.
ONE DAY IN THE VALLEY
Why, Ari, why?
- I'm in bed, E. Talk dirty to me.
- It's 5:00 in the morning.
- What are you wearing?
- Fuck you.
I love it when you say "fuck." Say it again.
Come on, E. It's game day, buddy.
Wake up.
This is our tradition.
Only this time we're playing for keeps.
No Pixar squirrel is going to stop us.
It's number one or bust, kid.
- You sound confident.
- Not a worry in the world.
So what are we hoping for?
$95 mil is what they're projecting.
- And what's good?
- $95 mil, Eric.
That would be good.
Expectations: you beat 'em by a dollar-- life is great;
Under by a dollar-- put a gun in your mouth and make sure I'm standing behind you.
Okay, keep in touch, Ari.
Game day, baby.
No go, no go.
You'll talk dirty to E...
Come on.
- It's been three weeks.
- I know, I know.
Just after we open, baby.
Then we're all good.
And if we don't open?
"If we don't open?" What-- no, no, no.
"If we don't open?" What do you mean by that?
Would you say that to a fighter on the morning of a bout?
"Maybe you'll get knocked out.
"See you after the fight if you're not in a coma"?
Don't jinx this, baby.
Not today.
Three soft-boiled eggs, boiled chicken, wheat toast with jam.
It's not a signature Johnny Drama breakfast but there's nothing there to upset your stomach.
Thanks, Johnny, but I'm not stressed.
You're hiding it, bro.
This is a big one.
You may not know you're stressed but trust me, you are stressed.
Moviefone says there's at 2:30 in Northridge.
The Valley?
What, are you crazy?
It's gonna reach 100° in the city today.
Vince wants to go to an out-of-the-way place.
Vince, you know my policy-- except for work,
I only go to the Valley November through March.
And even then-- only the sushi row.
Come on, Johnny, go for me.
I'd better hydrate.
So what do you think we're gonna open at, vin?
- Oh, God.
- Come on.
I don't play this game.
Come on, let's just fuck around a little.
Pick a number.
- Stop freaking him out, Turtle.
- I'm not freaking out.
I know we're gonna open.
It's a foregone conclusion.
- I'm not worried about it.
- So pick a number.
Okay.
$50 million.
Huh?
- Would that be good?
- That would be terrible, Vince.
- Really?
- This movie opens at $50 million, we're all working at Del Taco come Monday.
- So what do we need?
- The studio's projecting 95.
95?
Nice.
Fuck 95.
I got a little projection of my own.
$114,844,117.
- How is that?
- $1 more than "Spider-Man" made.
We do any less than that I'll personally consider the movie a flop.
You're an idiot, Turtle. "Spider-Man" is the biggest movie opening ever.
Plus Spider-Man had a much bigger fan base than Aquaman to begin with.
Can't happen.
We got James Cameron.
And those eyes.
It can happen.
You think we got a shot to topple Spidey, E?
Let's just topple 95, huh, guys?
I'll tell you what:
if we do beat "Spider-Man"
y'all are getting something sick.
Know that.
- How sick?
- What do you mean by "sick"?
It's not even 10:00 A.M. and it's burning up out there.
I know.
My widget says it's 96° already.
What the fuck's a widget?
Why are you sitting like that?
Seriously, what, are you wearing a butt plug?
No.
I brought you this for luck on the opening today.
What is this, a little Tae Bo instructor?
That is an authentic 12th century Yong Shi warrior, Ari.
He's the Mongolian symbol of strength.
If you carry him, you cannot be stopped.
This is Hollywood, Lloyd.
The only thing Mongolian is barbeque,
- but thanks.
I'll take what I can get.
- Oh, and...
I got you in with Dr. Marcus at 4:30.
Dr. Marcus?
Um, yeah.
Your wife called and said she needed an emergency session.
Fuck, Lloyd, why didn't you just tell her that I didn't have time?
- Because you do have time.
- Why didn't you lie?
Cause I'm scared of your wife, Ari.
Yeah, me too.
Maybe if I rub this little guy's balls she'll disappear.
We're going to the Valley, Drama, not the Sahara.
Hey, don't kid yourself, E. North of Ventura Boulevard is hell's waiting room.
Be prepared.
If you keep drinking we're gonna have to stop every 20' for you to take a leak.
That's what the empties are for.
Don't even think about pulling your dick out in my car, Drama.
- Hey, Ari.
- "Aquaman" is making waves, pal.
The first east coast numbers are in.
They're projecting $100 mil.
Oh, that is great news.
The movie gods are smiling on us today.
Well, it's still early.
We could do better, right?
I thought I was greedy.
Listen, the over-and-under is 95.
We hit 100-- I got wood.
I'm just saying.
I mean, "Spider-Man" did what, 114?
- Is there any way we can beat that?
- "Spider-Man"?
Who-- who's said anything about "Spider-Man"?
Eric... tell me that Vinnie doesn't think that we're gonna beat the biggest opening in movie history.
I'll tell you what:
manage your client's expectations.
Do your job.
Thank you for ruining my day.
Ari?
We all good?
I thought you're not worried about that stuff.
I'm not.
In fact, I don't wanna know anything till it's official.
- Can't we know?
- Let's roll.
103...
- My God.
- 104!
- Unbelievable.
- Shit.
- 105.
- Eat that, Drama.
- This is inhuman.
- Yeah, I guess it's true what they say.
The heat really does affect the elderly.
Yeah, seriously, Drama, 'cause I haven't seen somebody sweat like that since Patrick Ewing retired.
Great mother of God.
Fuck.
Dude, we got a monster, Vince.
It's one theater.
Don't get crazy.
How are we gonna get seats?
Who are you talking to?
There's four taped off for us in the back as we speak.
And all it cost us... was a signed copy of the new Aquaman game.
Nice job, Turtle.
I'm making a run for cooler pastures.
What do you think?
Oh, they're loving it.
Wait till they get a load of the end of this scene.
Jesus Christ, where's this jerkoff going?
Hey, pal-- you wanna sit down?
You're about to miss the best part of the whole movie.
I have to use the bathroom.
Sit down.
I dropped my monkey!
No, come back!
Here it comes!
What the fuck?
Shit, the projector must have gone out.
It's not just the projector.
We lost the central air.
...waiting for this movie two hours!
Ahem, sorry, folks.
It's a blackout.
Um, please calmly file into the lobby and we'll refund your money.
Whoa, whoa.
Refund their money?
They already saw half the movie.
Fuck that.
Shut the fuck up!
Give them some free popcorn or something.
Holy crap!
Aquaman!
Dude, what are you doing here?
Just checking out the movie like you guys.
Oh, but who's guarding the throne of Poseidonis?
It's about to be a madhouse in here.
- I'm gonna go get the car, all right?
- Fire up the AC.
The movie is great, Vince.
We caught the 10:00 A.M. showing too.
That harpoon fight was badass.
Did you hear that, E?
They thought I was badass.
- I heard.
- Hey, so Vince, let me ask you-- was that seahorse you rode animatronic or computer generated?
- E?
- Animatronic.
- Animatronic.
- Yes!
You owe me $20.
That is him!
- Oh my God!
- Can I have your autograph, Vince?
Whoo!
We made it.
Now let's get back to civilization.
Please.
I begged you to take the 101, but you had to take the canyon.
- It's more scenic.
- Just get me home, please.
All the lights are out, Drama.
What would you like me to do?
You know, it looks like the whole area is blacked out.
I'm gonna call Ari.
Hey, I was just dialing you.
Hey.
That must mean that we're destined to be in love.
Yeah.
You're having a blackout over there too?
I haven't had a blackout since I took four quaaludes
And forgot I fucked Chantal Lautenberg.
Why?
Cause we're in Northridge.
The whole area is blacked out.
- Is this gonna affect the numbers?
- I didn't even know that Northridge survived the '94 quake, E.
Don't worry about that.
Listen, you with Vinnie?
Yeah.
Okay, be very cool.
Do not get him excited, but the first west coast numbers are in,
- and they're big.
- Go on.
- Eight-legs big, bitch.
- Get the fuck out of here.
The webcrawler is in our sights, Eric, and I want to squash that fucker!
So do I, Ari.
All right, thanks.
What?
Nothing.
Fuck you, "nothing." What is it?
Nothing until it's official, right, Vince?
Fuck official.
I don't want you to know anything I don't.
- Is it "Spider-Man"?
- Spidey, E?
- Say something, dick.
- E, speak now or I'm throwing you out of the car.
"Spider-Man" is in our sights.
Yes!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Yes!
- I knew it!
Fuck you, Tobey!
- It's not definite though, Vince.
- Yeah, no, I know.
That's cool.
Let's go buy some toys anyway to celebrate.
- Yes.
- I know a place.
But not in the Valley, right?
They got toys in the city, Vince.
How do you know this area, Turtle?
Best rub-and-tug in California used to be next door.
Yeah, they probably moved to Santa Monica where it's cool.
There she is.
Ducatis.
Sweet.
This is the one for me, Vince, the fastest production bike on the road.
It's yours.
E?
I appreciate it, Vince, but I'm not a motorcycle guy, and I'm not gonna take a gift just to take one.
You neither, Johnny?
You know I hate rice rockets, Vince.
Ducati's Italian, Drama.
Yeah, well, regardless it's still a foreign job.
I'm a Harley man.
Yeah, didn't you have one when you first came out here?
Yeah, I had to hock it to Michael Madsen after a couple of bleak pilot seasons.
God, I loved that bike.
Why don't we go over there tomorrow
- and make him an offer he can't refuse?
- You serious?
God, you're a fucking prince, bro.
You know, he's also got a watch of mine.
Mr. Chase, have you decided yet?
Yes, we have.
We'll take four of these.
Maybe you guys will grow to love 'em.
Not again.
So when is the last time you had sex?
With each other or...?
If you're not gonna take this seriously, Ari--
I'm taking it seriously.
It's just for the money we're spending here I could get you a pro to service your even most bizarre fetishes.
Okay, you see?
This is what I'm dealing with.
- Come on.
- Don't.
- It's Vince.
- Ari don't you feel that a lacking sexual relationship is a big problem in a marriage?
Oh, I do, doc, but we fuck more than any other married couple you know.
And I know this because whenever we go out with another married couple and the subject comes up they always say, "I can't believe how often you guys fuck."
- It's Vince, baby.
- I don't give a fuck.
Okay-- you know, uh, after the year that I've had and on the most important day of my life you'd think that she would ask me what I wanted, you know?
A nice blowjob, perhaps, where I could just sit back for the first time in nine months and do nothing but admire the top of her head and pray that this fucking movie opens so I can stop selling off assets
like we're fucking Michael Jackson.
Now I have to answer the fucking batphone when it rings three fucking times and it's fucking Vince, okay?
So...
- Eric, speak.
- Ari-- there's been another blackout in a different part of the Valley.
You need a fucking night-light or something?
Get back over the hill, okay?
And don't call me back unless--
Fuck me.
- What's going on, Ari?
- I'm gonna call you back.
Can we prorate this session, please?
- He's gonna call us back.
- Anything to worry about?
- Hey, Aquaman.
- Oh, great.
We're being stalked by devo.
- This isn't a coincidence, is it?
- No, we followed you.
- Replenish.
- We, uh, wanted to know if you guys wanted to come to a party.
It's our big graduation bash.
High school party?
Sorry, kid, we don't go to the parties where the girls ain't legal.
Although we do like 'em barely legal.
Come on, Vince, come with us.
It'll be like "Almost Famous."
- Hey, I like that movie.
- Vince, I'm burning up out here.
Another hour and my kidneys may shut down.
They've got a pool.
- Really?
- Yeah, it'll be great.
And it'll be a lot easier to get in with you there, Vince.
So that's it?
You guys need Vince to get you into the party.
What are you laughing at, Turtle?
You still can't get into teddy's without Vince.
Do you wanna go?
Fuck it.
It's gonna take hours to get home anyway, right?
So you'll come?
- Yeah, we'll come.
- All right!
Aquaman to the rescue!
- Hey, girl.
- Hey!
Did kids look this young when we went to high school?
- In Drama's eighth year they did, yes.
- Six years, assholes.
Ad just like I did for these maggots I'm gonna do for you guys.
Someone gives you guys a hard time about being here--
Johnny Drama's got your back.
Thanks.
There are some really tough kids at this school.
Come on, I'm from New York.
Who the fuck let nerds in my house?
- Here we go.
- Jesus...
Drama's gonna get his ass kicked by a 16-year-old.
- Hey, Kessler.
- Who let you losers in?
- These guys are with us.
- Yeah?
Who the fuck are you?
Uh, he's my brother.
Sorry, we were just passing by, we saw the party, we figured we'd drop in.
Whoa, whoa, holy shit.
You're Vince Chase.
You're with these two?
Jay and Reggie?
Yeah, they're my cousins.
But hey, it's cool.
We'll find another party.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, you stay.
Reggie and Jay, stay.
This old guy, he can stay too.
Uh, you need a beer, Vince?
That'd be good.
Thanks.
Holy shit, Vince Chase.
Hey everyone, fuckin' Aquaman is at my house!
Give me something good, Ari.
There's nothing good at all, E. Nothing good.
- Why?
What's happening?
- There are massive rolling blackouts from the heat.
They're hitting the whole fucking coast from San Francisco down to San Diego.
Shit.
Well, I guess we can kiss "Spider-Man" goodbye.
Forget "Spider-Man." I just named two of the most populated cities in the whole fucking country.
- So what does that mean, Ari?
- It means that we are fucked.
We took a massive hit on the midday numbers and now they are projecting 85.
Jesus Christ.
What am I gonna tell Vince?
Same thing you've been telling him all day-- nothing!
Keep your mouth shut until it's official.
Yeah, when's that gonna be?
It's gonna be in a few hours, all right?
I want you to email me your address and I will come and tell him with you, all right?
Lloyd!
What happened to the music?
It's a blackout, baby!
Into the pool!
Yeah, our moms say Reggie looked exactly like I did when I was his age.
You don't see it?
- A little, I guess.
- And you're related to Jay too?
Oh, we're practically like brothers.
You girls should take care of these two.
I'm gonna get a drink.
You want anything?
All good, Vince.
- Good to hear it, Reggie.
- Jay.
Ha-ha!
Life is good, huh?
Any word?
- No, nothing official.
- What does that mean?
How is this possible?
An hour ago we're the biggest opening ever
- and now we're a disaster?
- Yeah, well, fucking blackouts.
Fucking blackouts.
See, this is why I don't like to get caught up in this shit.
You shouldn't let me get caught up in it, E.
- Vince, come on.
- I know, I know.
I asked.
I'm sorry, buddy.
Yeah.
Look at these kids.
This used to be us.
Remember how we used to talk about coming out to Hollywood?
- It wasn't about money.
- No, it wasn't.
Fuck it.
We're not gonna let this town make it about money now.
- Let's get hammered.
- With 17-year-olds?
- We'll make their night.
- All right.
Blackouts?
Fucking blackouts?
Thank you very much!
The town will understand, Ari.
It's not the movie's fault.
Baby, it wasn't the Cubs' fault when that douche bag grabbed the foul ball either, but they still don't get a World Series ring.
There are no asterisks in this life, only scoreboards, and ours is currently reading "fucked."
Well, there's nothing you can do about it now, so why don't you sit down and relax?
Baby, I can't relax until I tell Vinnie.
I gotta go to the Valley.
After the call.
And who knows when that will be?
Baby, isn't it a little convenient that the kids are at your mother's?
Ari, I've been patient, but now whatever happens is totally out of your control.
So let's go upstairs.
Fine, but I'm not gonna like it.
Oh really?
All right, I may like it just a little bit.
Baby, I don't want you to hear this.
I could cry.
I have to go to the Valley.
I promise you when I get back, no matter what, we're gonna dent that headboard.
No bullshit.
I guarantee you you will not walk right tomorrow.
Tell me something good.
Vince, Vince, Vince, Vince!
- So you work with Vince?
- Yep.
- Is it fun?
- Yep.
You don't talk much, huh?
Not to high school girls, sweetheart.
No offense.
I'm not in high school.
This is my little brother's party.
I'm just chaperoning.
Ew.
That was a real creepy turn.
You may have a couple pounds on me but nothing outweighs experience.
You ready?
Are you ready?
Hey, everybody!
Do you know how good your lives are right now?
Yeah!
My boys are here from high school and we wish we could be back living like this!
Yeah!
What the fuck is he doing?
He wanted his "Almost Famous" moment.
I told you not to tell him anything until it was official.
Aw, what the fuck is the difference, Ari?
Hey, Vinnie!
Ari is in the Valley?
Holy shit, we really must be fucked, huh?
What are they projecting now?
45, Ari?
- 116, actually.
- What?
- 116, kid!
- How's that possible?
You guys ever hear of a hanging chad?
Where the fuck am I?
Listen, the biggest thing the blackouts affected were the actual reporting of the numbers.
- We beat "Spider-Man"?
- Well, it's only Friday, but if there isn't a tornado in the Midwest
I think we've got a good goddamn shot, my friend.
Hey, everybody, you've got the biggest movie star on the planet on your roof right now.
It's all you, baby!
- Number one, baby.
- Yeah!
Do it!
So whose dad is this?
I don't know.
Why don't you throw him in the pool?
Fuck you, "throw me in the pool."
Hey, Kong, go get us some beers.
- Put him in!
Put him in!
- Go, go!
Hey, you little fuck, these are $900 shoes!
Okay, you guys are not gonna believe this!
Those two girls you introduced us to?
The most untouchable girls in school.
But guess what--
They like you.
They wanna hang in my basement.
Basement!
Nice!
The only problem is, we can't all fit on the Vespa.
You can't roll chicks in a Vespa, bro.
Well, we were hoping maybe you could give us a lift.
- A lift?
- Yeah, right.
I can't do that.
But what I can do is this:
Turtle, give our new best friends
- the keys to the Mas'.
- There you go.
Oh, that is so cool!
You're lending us your car?
- My car.
- How do we get it back to you?
You don't.
You return it to the Beverly Hills Maserati dealership.
Your lease ends at the end of August.
- No way.
- Holy shit.
That was actually refreshing, but I have to go home to hammer the wife.
Give us a lift.
Anything to keep me away from my house.
Come on, bro.
We out.
Yeah, the Valley ain't so bad.
BASED ON REAL EVENTS
Everythinh I loved was over...
And then...
life itself.
Omar?
Please come.
I'm on the highway.
I hit a kid.
He's not moving.
He's not moving!
What's your name?
Catalina, don't even think about moving the car.
- A mechanic should see it first.
- Really?
With all the things I have to do.
By the way, it's almost midnight.
You sister should be here.
What is it?
What's the matter?
Breathe!
Where are you going?
Catalina!
Agata!
No!
My sister!
- Let me go!
- Catalina!
Let me go!
She got hit...
Look at her!
She's arresting.
No...
No, Agata, don't!
Don't, Agata!
Please, don't!
Let go of me!
Emergency room!
You can't go in!
You can't go in!
- Vital signs?
- Breathing in 12.
- Done.
- Pulse in 60.
Impossible, we have to amputate.
Saw.
Are you Miss Hameran's relatives?
I'm her sister, doctor.
Catalina.
I'm Dr. Morales.
- Would you like to sit down?
- No.
- How's my sister?
- She's stable.
Thank God she's out of danger.
Unfortunately we had to amputate both legs to save her.
I'm sorry.
There's something else.
Your sister has gone into a coma.
She's not reacting to anything.
May I see her?
Of course, ma'am.
But... your sister's face is very swollen, and her body...
Well, I just want you to be prepared.
I'm sorry, sir.
Only next of kin.
Sis...
Help me.
Help me.
Ma'am?
Ma'am?
Ma'am?
You have to rest.
And the kid?
What kid?
The one my sister hit with her car.
We didn't get any children tonight.
I suggest you go home.
We'll let you know if anything changes.
Here.
They're sleeping pills.
Never leave me.
Never forhet me.
Always wait for me.
Forgive me, dauhhter.
I didn't know what I was doing.
I never thouhht you could, never.
Don't cry, I'm okay.
I'm here.
How's she doing?
Badly.
Any news?
No.
We just have to wait.
- I want to see her.
- They won't let you.
I'll stay.
I'll call you if anything happens.
I have to see her.
I called the office, told them I won't be in for a few days.
You can stay at my house if you want.
I mean, it's closer.
So you won't have to take the highway.
Thanks.
It'll be all right.
Your sister will come out of it.
I'm gonna stay at Omar's for a few days.
It's closer.
Yes.
I heard that.
Thanks.
See you here.
Omar, I want you to know I'm here for you, okay?
Agata's always been very nice to me and... well, you know.
Thanks, Nuño.
Catalina has been very important to me ever since I got to Mexico.
- Ever since college.
- Yes.
Agata told me.
She's a good friend.
I care for her.
I can see that.
It's obvious you do.
Have you told her that?
That I care for her?
I show her.
I did tell her.
What the fuck are you talking about?
One day I argued with Agata so I went to her house to apologize and I confused them.
What do you want?
They're identical.
Wrong.
They're very different.
I want to take a look at the highway.
Will you get her things?
Okay.
I'll wait for you here.
DRY FIREWOOD FOR SALE
ENTRYWAY TO "EL ENCANTO"
Hello?
Hey, you!
What are you doing there?
You didn't hear me?
I'm talking to you!
Son of a bitch...
Coming!
Lose anything?
No.
My girlfriend had an accident here last night.
I was looking around, seeing if there was anything here.
- You sure?
- About what?
Are you sure you weren't looking for anyone?
How do you know?
Don't look.
It was an accident.
I'm in charge of the investigation.
You're investigating?
You could call it that.
You could call it that?
Don't go looking for trouble.
Don't investigate on your own.
Trouble?
- Trouble, why?
- Do you need a ride?
I just heard someone scurrying over there.
- Just now?
- Yeah.
What's your name?
- Omar.
- Look, Omar.
Better focus on helping your girlfriend.
I heard something, I tell you.
- No.
- Why?
See, let me explain.
- Don't.
- Let me finish.
You know what?
Give me your name and badge number.
Martin Ugalde, 02034.
- Martin who?
- Listen for your own good, don't come back here.
Is that a threat?
Action!
Ahata and Catalina's birthday.
June 2004.
Here's sister number 1.
She's beautiful.
Thanks honey.
Here...
there's sister number 2.
Look...
they're identical.
They're identical.
She's talkinh to her Spaniard friend.
Very funny.
After a few hours we're still at the party and people are drinking as you can see.
The sisters are drinking as well.
And fightinh.
As usual.
They fight.
Mom!
Sister!
Sister!
Help me!
Help me!
You left the door...
Sorry, sorry.
I thought you'd seen me.
Where were you?
What are those?
Pills.
Why?
Youre not feeling well?
No.
- Why?
- What do you want me to say?
Nothing.
Take it easy.
I haven't said anything.
Here.
I brought your things and I got you something to eat.
I'm off.
Nuño thanks.
I know you're trying to help, but I have to figure this out on my own.
Yeah.
I get it.
I understand you, but you're not on your own.
All right?
The doctor said we should speak to you.
That it might do you good.
The truth, I have so many things to tell you.
I dreamed of mother.
She and dad got along better with you.
We're alike, but you're better at everything.
They like you better.
And I hate to acknowledge it, but it made me angry to see you happy.
It made me angry that dad trusted you more.
But I love you.
I love you more than I love myself.
Agata!
Agata!
Agata, can you hear me?
Agata, it's me, Catalina!
Somebody help me, please.
My sister woke up.
Calm down, ma'am.
Nurses, the equipment.
She twitched one finger and opened her eyes.
Sorry I didn't warn you before but these things are normal in comatose patients.
The nervous system sends electrical discharges.
No.
She looked at me.
Please believe me, ma'am.
We haven't registered any readings.
Machines don't lie.
- How're you?
- How is Agata?
The same?
They stopped the bleeding.
She's still in a coma.
We must be patient.
Wait a few days.
Nuño, can you take me to the highway after lunch?
Yeah, sure.
Your house?
No, where the accident happened.
What for?
Agata hit a kid with the car.
Where is he?
There's no such kid, Catalina.
And there's nothing there.
I need to go.
I need to go there.
I can't explain it.
Go eat something.
I'll catch up with you, and we'll go.
Omar aren't you getting confused again?
Why are you telling me this?
You know.
Are you serious?
You all right?
- What is it?
- Nothing.
You know?
It's incredible that after such a long time I know nothing about you.
- What do you mean?
- I know some things, but when I ask you about yourself important things you shut me out.
Like, for instance, about your parents, I don't know what happened.
- I have no family.
- Yes, you always say that.
Why don't you just let it go?
Because I don't like to talk about that, Nuño.
I don't get you.
No matter how hard I try, I don't.
I'm done.
I cant take it anymore.
My dad died in an accident.
An accident...
on hisjob.
In a construction site.
And my mom...
She was sick.
She was a schizophrenic.
She never remembered the pills she had to take and dad always told Agata to remind her.
He always trusted her more.
I don't know why.
I got jealous.
I gave mom the bottle of pills.
It was my fault she took too many pills.
She drowned.
Me and Agata got her out.
We tried to revive her.
We were seven!
Sorry, I didn't know.
I'm all right.
Don't tell Omar.
Omar, wouldn't you rather let Nuño drive?
You haven't slept.
What's the matter with you two?
- Nothing.
- Nothing.
We're close.
I know.
Around Km 30, ease off a bit.
I said I know.
I speak the same language.
It's just a suggestion, Nuño.
Suggestion.
Go to hell.
- Why are you doing that?
- Lighten up, man, okay?
Don't talk to me like that.
Don't start with your bullshit, like back there.
What are you talking about?
What is it with you two?
Sorry, this fog makes me nervous.
Little Spaniard gets nervous.
What?
I said, little Spaniard gets nervous.
I heard you.
Settle down, all right?
Nuño, watch out!
Hello?
Yes, ma'am, it's an emergency.
A dead person in the Desierto de los Leones.
Yes.
Who?
What?
Hello?
Hello?
Yes.
Omar...
Omar Cantu.
Who's there?
Who's there?
- I'm okay.
- What's the matter with you?
I'm talking to you.
What's the matter?
I saw the kid, Omar.
He's there, I swear.
- Nuño.
- Hey.
I'll go.
It's okay.
You'll be free by the morning.
It's not my fault.
Nuño, calm down.
Calm down, you're not under arrest.
I'll be right over.
We'll straighten out this mess downtown.
- Yes, but take your hands off me.
- Calm down, Nuño!
Come with me.
You'll be tested there.
Are you going to tell me what happened?
I heard... a woman on the street.
Last night, too.
I thought she was Agata.
Then she was screaming and crying in a manhole.
Inside the sewer system.
- What are those pills for?
- Why do you want to know?
They're doing something to you.
No, it's the other way around.
- Are they prescription?
- Who cares?
I won't take them anymore if it makes you happy.
I'd be happy if you didn't go back to that house and that highway.
Sorry.
I need to talk to you.
What about?
What's wrong with you?
It's that I can't get it out of my head.
Her voice asking for help.
When she called, I heard it all.
The sound of the horn the screeching tires, the impact...
We argued that night.
It was probably...
It wasn't your fault.
I told her I wasn't sure about loving her.
I felt she was putting pressure on me.
Remember when I started dating her?
I went to your house, apologized to you I begged for ten minutes.
And you... didn't say a word.
You just played along.
I could never tell her the same things I told you.
I could never tell her that I love her.
That I need her, that I do love her.
She knows, Omar.
She knows.
I'm sure because I also know.
And you'll tell her so when she wakes up.
You're identical.
Sometimes...
I'd like to imagine you're her.
Nuño was right.
We can get confused.
Look.
Nuño and I don't get along.
But that guy has a great heart.
And he loves you.
Garcia Castro, Maria Concepcion.
She had ID on her.
Here's the forensic report and I spoke to the doctor.
She's been dead for about 23 hours.
She died almost one day ago.
The guy didn't kill her.
He went by there six or seven hours ago.
He hit a dead woman.
Poor boy.
He was worried sick.
Let the "poor boy" go then.
Did you denounce me?
I knew it.
What are you doing here?
"An accident on Km 31 of the Desierto de los Leones highway. "
Again?
Didn't I tell you to stay away from there?
How's your friend?
Still in a coma.
Oh, man!
- Remember what I told you up there?
- Yeah.
We're looking for that kid.
I've been looking for him for three years.
There have been accidents.
Mostly, with young women.
They call in scared, badly hurt...
Sometimes they're reported dead.
They try to keep it under tabs.
They call us inept... you know.
That's why I keep a low profile on this.
Well, that and because it's hard to believe.
Why are there so many accidents up there?
Do you believe in ghosts?
Ghosts?
That is absurd.
I can only offer you proof.
You draw your own conclusions.
You wanna know or not?
Sign here, please.
I need a... pen.
Here you go.
- Catalina?
- Nuño, how are you?
Better.
They're about to release me.
It appears that I didn't kill her.
She'd been dead for many hours.
But she was on her feet.
We saw her!
Yes, I know.
I can't get it out of my mind either.
I have to find out what's hoing on there.
What do you want to do?
Let's go to that place.
The kid could live over there.
Catalina, I don't think we should go...
Make somethinh up, het Omar to lend you his car but don't tell him where we're hoing.
Catalina, do you remember the sign?
Which one?
Back there.
- The dry firewood one?
- Yeah.
You think "El Encanto" could be a village?
Don't know.
Why?
Because it's that way.
Let's go.
What now?
Do we knock?
Come in, child.
I was expecting you.
Who is it?
Omar.
Omar Cantu.
Hello.
Come in.
How're you, officer?
Martin.
Or Ugalde, have it your way.
Ugalde.
My beloved pets.
You like fish?
You're right.
Let's cut to the chase.
Come in.
You've met my pets.
Now I'll introduce you to my obsession
SUPER CRASH
MORE WOMEN IN CRASHES
PHANTOM GIRL
Coffee?
Why did you say you were waiting for me?
I know who you are.
I know you have many questions.
I also know why you came here.
Your answers are in a tragedy that happened long ago.
It has to do with you and your sister.
My sister?
I already told you:
Your being here is not a coincidence.
Those are the only cases I could salvage prior to 2001.
But when I began investigating twenty-five cases.
But... you spoke of a tragedy.
This happened many, many years ago.
During the colonization, in a village close to Mexico City.
In that village lived a very beautiful young woman.
...a Spaniard soldier deceived her by using her to have the children his wife couldn't give him.
When she realised, she became crazy and threw herself and her baby to the river along with her, to die.
Since then, the souls of the women and the children are condemned to deambulate around rivers.
Mostly, the children encounter young women.
The mother's hrief is heard like a howl crying out for her dead children.
Some live to tell.
Others don't.
If this were true, there'd be...
There'd be ghosts all over the place.
Perhaps not all over the place, but take a look at this.
I heard that woman.
- Where?
- On Rio Mixcoac Ave.
Screaming, grieving just like you said.
Did you see the baby as well?
Do you have anything else on the woman on Mixcoac?
Yes, plenty of cases.
"February 19, 1999, Rio Mixcoac Avenue.
"Agroup of high school kids reported hearing a woman trapped in a manhole. "
Why are you so interested on Rio Mixcoac Ave.?
I live close by.
My sister- in-law said she heard a woman around there.
I didn't know what she was talking about, but...
Now you believe me, right?
I've got a map around here.
Look.
Your sister is burdened with someone else's pain and nobody can help her with that.
Not praying, nor sacrifices.
Nothing.
Although perhaps your sister can help.
- How?
She's trapped between two worlds.
But you have a bond with your sister.
That is why you can see the other world and you can bring it to you and to the people around you.
What worlds?
The world of the living and that of the dead.
Sorry, but that I know of, the existence of ghosts hasn't been proved.
But there are people who claim having seen them.
D'you think they lie?
No.
Not necessarily.
A noble, sensitive spirit can hear and see a grieving soul.
But be careful.
There are spirits who can transform themselves or what you see.
They can help you but they can also deceive you, like any living person.
It's dark and I don't want you running any unecessary risks.
Catalina, you can stay in the room.
Nuño, you can make yourself comfortable by fireplace.
We're not staying, are we?
I trust her.
The bedtime story was fine, but do you actually believe all this?
I heard that woman, Nuño.
- Catalina...
- Nuño, it's true.
Agata is trapped in that place.
I can feel it.
She tells me so.
I dream about it.
Catalina?
Catalina!
Impossible.
Impossible.
Catalina, this is Omar.
Please call me back.
It's urgent.
I've met this person...
you're right.
We have to find that woman in the sewer of Rio Mixcoac.
There's an entrance by my house.
Call me back.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
Catalina!
Nuño!
Hey!
It's dangerous out here.
Here.
I'll get back on my own.
Catalina!
Hail, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.
Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb.
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners...
Mystic rose, pray for them.
Tower of David, pray for them.
Ivory tower, pray for them.
House of gold, pray for them
Ark of the Covenant, pray for them.
Gates of heaven, pray for them.
Nuño.
What?
It's day.
You haven't slept, have you?
I'll sleep later.
Good morning, children.
I'll make coffee.
Thanks, but we'll be on our way.
It's no bother.
I'm always on my own.
- Here, you dropped it.
- Thanks.
I didn't hear you go out.
You were awake all night, weren't yout?
You're right not to want to sleep.
When you sleep, you're sensitive, you're open.
Maybe it'll help you get closer to your sister.
Ask her for advice.
Sleep.
She'll guide us.
You'll probably have to go back and face that woman.
With her spirit.
Look beyond what your eyes can see.
Forgive me, ma'am, but what are you talking about?
I will only ask you to be strong.
Help us, even when you don't understand.
Take care.
Fight.
Defend yourself.
What are you doing?
Seeing some things Omar left.
- Where did he get all this?
- Don't know.
But I think I'm beginning to understand.
Need any help?
Weren't you going to see your sister?
Nuño thanks for everything.
I've been thinking about things and and I thought about all these years and I don't know...
- No.
- Let me tell you.
Catalina.
Not now.
It's not a good moment.
You're under a lot of pressure.
It's not a good moment.
All right.
Look.
Look at this old map.
The old lady said all this happened during the colony.
I compared it to a modern map.
Come here.
The city was very small.
The size of the central square.
Here is the old village of Coyoacan.
Presently, the neighborhood of Coyoacan.
You know that.
There was a river here.
Look at the modern map.
It's right underneath this avenue:
Mixcoac.
Of course!
The Mixcoac River!
The same river that crosses the Desierto de los Leones.
It goes over all the same points.
Maybe the old lady was right when she said that about looking beyond the eyes...
OLD WOMAN ENDS HER LIFE
I don't know.
What is it?
See something?
No, no.
I'll go see my sister.
Shall I go with you?
Catalina!
Omar?
Omar, what happened to you?
What's wrong with you?
You're scaring me!
Answer me, please!
Omar.
What is it?
What's the matter with you?
Answer me!
Where are we going?
Omar.
Omar, damn it, answer me!
Where are we going?
Omar, what are we doing here?
Hello?
I'm calling to report a dead person.
Km 31, on the Desierto de los Leones highway.
No, I won't leave my name.
Message received today.
Catalina, this is Omar.
Please call me back.
It's urgent.
I've met a person who...
You're right...
we have to find that woman.
At the Rio Mixcoac sewer.
There's an entrance by my house.
I'm going to the road to look for you.
Call me back please.
They won't beat me.
You won't beat me, you won't beat me.
I can't!
I can't do it anymore.
I can't.
I can't do it anymore.
I'm not scared.
I'm not scared.
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not in my mind.
Agata is with me.
I'll help her.
She needs me.
We're not different.
We're the same.
We're one.
Horrifyingly identical.
In my mind...
I'm not.
Shit!
Taxi!
To the Desierto de los Leones highway.
Affirmative.
Km 31, Desierto de los Leones highway.
What happened?
He was hit by a car last night.
Last night?
Where did they find him?
There, on the side of the road.
In the bushes.
Wasn't there a woman here?
Awoman?
No.
Please, get back.
Excuse me, officer, what's the name of the deceased?
Omar Cantu.
Excuse me!
You knew Omar?
Yes, I knew him.
Who are you?
I'm...
Well, we were friends.
Yes, we met downtown.
I'm Martin Ugalde.
I saw Omar yesterday, gave him some files.
Files?
Yes, I saw them too.
There's something very weird.
The river still exists.
Like the old lady said...
What are you talking about?
Which old lady?
An old lady that lives close by, in an old house.
- Show me.
- I can't.
I must find my friend.
One thing at a time.
It can't be.
It's here, right?
An old lady used to live here but she commited suicide on the highway.
It happened in the forties.
She told Catalina to look here.
Help me find her, please.
Catalina is sure she can communicate with her sister.
They've done it forever.
The old lady said she's asking for help or somethinh.
Do you know exactly where in Mixcoac?
Yeah, well... more or less.
Omar gave us a map.
It's near his place.
Of course, I made those marks.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Why did you do this to me?
- I'm not crazy...
- Mom's here.
Take it easy.
- Easy.
- Why did you do this?
Honey don't.
Must be around here.
Look!
The car.
There she is.
Don't move.
Ma'am!
Officer!
Catalina!
Hello, child.
We're here.
I came to help, my child.
It's the only way to put an end to this.
To help your sister.
Are you ready to sacrifice yourself for her?
I already tried.
I sacrificed myself for them but it didn't do any good.
Because the children didn't die where the highway is now.
The river dragged them there but they died here.
The sacrifice should've been made here.
Now I know it...
thanks to you.
And your sister.
Who are you?
Let Agata go.
I know where you are, but leave my sister alone.
Don't leave me here, darling.
Don't be afraid.
I've been expecting you.
Forgive me, mother!
There's nothing to forgive.
Come, child.
Come with us.
Calm down.
Don't fear.
Calm down.
My dear it will be over soon.
Catalina!
Catalina!
Catalina!
It's me, Nuño!
I won't leave you.
Never, never.
There, there.
What is it?
Where are we?
In the sewer.
What is it?
What's wrong?
My love, why are you staring at me?
- Who are you?
- It's me, Catalina.
You're not Catalina!
Catalina?
Drop the gun!
Drop it!
Now!
Nuño, what's wrong?
You have to do it.
Nuño!
It's the only way.
You must end this.
Nuño, drop the gun!
I'm Catalina.
Everythinh I loved was over...
And then...
life itself.
What happened?
Hey.
Hey.
Hey!
Where am I?
Take it easy.
You're in the hospital.
What happened?
Where is Catalina?
I'm glad you're here, doctor.
She woke up this morning very upset.
I gave her 15 mg of Diazepam during the night.
- She calmed down?
- Yes.
Where is Catalina?
Catalina is dead.
You killed her.
Don't you remember?
What are you talking about?
It can't be.
What did you see?
Who was it?
I must see her!
What is this?
It's for your own safety until you recover.
You're gonna need help!
I have to see Catalina.
Untie me.
Untie me, I said!
Where is Catalina?
Untie me!
Thank you.
Agata.
Miss Hameran.
Hello, Agata.
Where am I?
In a hospital.
Don't make any effort.
Your memory will return gradually.
Where is he?
Where is my child?
- What child?
- My child.
My child!
You don't have any children.
Where is my child?
Don't get upset, please.
Don't get...
Where is my child?
Where is he?
Nurse!
- Stay calm, please.
- Where is my child?
Where is my child?
BASED ON A TRUE STORY
Everything I loved in life ended.
And then life itself.
-Hello?
-Omar?
Come here, please.
I'm on the highway, I ran over a kid.
He's not dead, he's not dead.
Answer me, where are you?
What's your name?
Catalina, don't take the car.
It needs to be checked.
-Really?
-Yes.
On top of everything else I have to do.
It's almost 12 o'clock, by the way.
Your sister should be here by now.
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
Catalina, breathe!
Where are you going?
Agata!
Agata!
Sister!
No, let me go!
-Catalina!
-Let me go!
No, look at her!
Look at her!
No!
This side.
The heart stopped, help me.
No!
Agata!
No, Agata!
Emergency room.
You can't go through.
You can't go through.
-26 years old.
-25.75.
25.75!
Quickly!
-Vital signs?
-Breathing: 12.
-Ready.
-Pulse: 60.
Impossible.
We have to amputate.
-I got her.
-The saw.
kilometer 31
Relatives of Miss Hameran?
I'm her sister, doctor.
Catalina.
My name is Doctor Morales.
-Sit down, please.
-No.
-How is my sister?
-Stable.
Thankfully she's out of danger.
But regretfully we amputated both her legs to save her.
I'm sorry.
There's something else to attend right now.
Your sister went into a coma.
She's not reacting at all.
Can I see her?
Of course, Miss.
But your sister's face is very inflamed and her body is...
Well, just be prepared.
I'm sorry, young man.
Family members only.
Little sister.
Help me, help me.
Help me.
Miss?
Miss?
... on earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.
Amen.
Miss?
You need to rest, miss.
And the kid?
-What kid?
-The kid my sister ran over.
We haven't treated any kids here.
Go back home.
If anything changes we'll let you know.
Here.
They'll help you sleep.
Never leave me.
Never forget me.
Wait for me forever.
Forgive me, my child, I didn't know what I was doing.
I never thought that of you, never.
Don't cry, I'm okay.
I'm here.
How is she?
Bad.
-Anything else?
-Nothing.
We have to wait.
-I want to see her.
-You can't go in.
I'll be here, if anything happens I'll tell you.
I need to go in and see her.
I told my partner I'm going away for a few days.
You can stay at my house if you want.
It's closer, so you don't have to take the highway.
Thanks.
Relax.
Your sister will wake up.
I will stay at Omar's house a few days.
It's closer.
Okay.
Nuno, come with me to get Catalina's things.
-Yeah, sure.
-Let's go.
Catalina?
Yeah, I heard.
Thanks, I'll wait for you here.
Omar, I'm here if you need anything.
Agata always treated me well, you know.
Thanks, Nuno.
Catalina has been important in my life since I got to Mexico.
Since university.
Yeah.
Agata told me.
She's been a good friend.
I really love her.
I can tell.
I can tell you love her.
You told her?
That I love her?
I show it to her.
I told her.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Once I had a fight with Agata and I went to her house to ask for forgiveness and I mistook her for Catalina.
What do you expect?
They're identical.
Sorry, they're very different.
I want to go to the highway.
-Can you go and get her things?
-Okay, I'll wait inside.
DRY firewood FOR SALE
Hello?
Hey, what are you doing?
Didn't you hear me?
I'm talking to you.
Fucking hell.
I'm coming!
Did you lose something?
No.
My girlfriend had an accident and I checked if there was anything left here.
-Sure?
-Sure about what?
Sure you're not looking for someone?
How do you know?
Don't search, it was an accident.
I'm in charge of the investigation.
You're investigating?
You could say that.
"Could say that".
Don't get involved in problems.
Don't investigate on your own.
Problems?
Why problems?
Do you have a car or shall I take you?
I just heard someone hiding back there.
Just now?
Yes.
What's your name?
-Omar.
-Look, Omar...
Just concentrate on helping your girlfriend.
-I told you I heard something.
-No.
Why?
-Let me explain to you.
-Don't explain to me.
-Let me go.
-I'm talking, friend.
You know what?
Tell me your name and license plate number.
Martiin Ugalde, 02034.
-Martiin what?
-Look.
For your own good, don't come around here again.
Are you threatening me?
We're now filming.
Agata and Catalina's birthday, June 2004.
Here's sister number one, look how beautiful she is.
Thank you, sweetheart.
And here is...
There she is, sister number two.
Take a good look at her, identical.
Identical, identical.
They're talking to Nuno.
Her dear friend.
Chorizo.
Well after a couple of hours, we're still here at the party and as we can see, everyone is drinking.
The two sisters drinking hard.
And fighing, like always.
Mommy!
Don't leave.
I'm sorry.
I love you.
Mommy!
Mommy!
Don't let her go!
.
Mommy!
.
Sister!
.
Sister!
.
Help me!
Help me!
Why did you leave the door opened?
Sorry.
I thought you'd seen me.
Where were you?
What are you taking?
My pills.
What's wrong?
Are you okay?
No.
-Why?
-What do you want me to say?
Okay.
Calm down, I didn't say anything.
Here's the suitcase and I've bought something to eat.
There.
Nuno.
Thanks.
I know you're trying, but at the end, I have to do this on my own.
Yes.
I understand.
I understand you but you're not alone.
The doctor told us to talk.
It could be good for you.
I have so many things to say to you.
I dreamt about Mom.
She and Dad got along better with you.
We're equal, but you're better at everything.
That's why they prefer you.
And I don't like to admit it, but I'd get so angry seeing you happy.
I got angry that Dad trusted you more.
But I love you.
I love you more than I love myself.
Agata!
Agata!
Agata, can you hear me?
Agata, it's me, Catalina!
Somebody help me, please.
-My sister woke up.
-It's okay, miss.
Apparatus, nurses.
She moved a finger and she opened her eyes.
Sorry I didn't warn you before, Miss but this normally happens with comatose patients.
They are electric shocks that circulate in the nervous system.
No.
She saw me.
Please, believe me, Miss.
We haven't registered any measurements and the apparatus don't lie.
How are you?
-How's Agata?
-The same?
They've stopped the hemorrhage.
She's still in a coma.
We have to be patient, wait a few days.
Nuno, can you take me to the highway after we eat?
Yes, of course.
To your house?
No.
To the scene of the accident.
-What for?
-Agata ran over a kid.
-Where's that kid?
-Catalina, there is no kid.
And there's nothing on the highway.
I need to go.
I need to go to the scene.
I can't explain to you.
Get something to eat.
I'll catch you up and we'll go to the highway.
Omar?
Don't get them mixed up again.
-Why do you say that?
-You know why.
Are you serious?
Everything okay?
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.
You know it's incredible that after such a long time there is so little I know about you.
-What are you talking about?
-I know a few things, but when I ask you about yourself, things that are important, I don't know, it's like you shut me out.
For example, I don't know what happened with your parents.
-I don't have a family.
-That's always your answer.
But why don't you just...
-...
let it go?
-I don't like talking about it.
I don't understand you.
No matter how hard I try, I don't understand you.
I can't do it anymore.
My Dad died in an accident.
A work accident.
On a construction site.
And my Mom was sick.
She was schizophrenic.
She couldn't remember which pills to take, and my dad would get Agata to remind her.
He always trusted her more.
I don't know why.
I felt jealous.
I gave that bottle to my mom.
It's my fault she took too many pills and she drowned.
Agata and I got her out of there.
We tried to revive her.
We were seven years old.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
I'm okay.
Don't say anything to Omar.
Omar do you prefer Nuno to drive?
You've hardly slept.
-What's up with you two?
-Nothing.
We're nearly there.
Yes, I know.
When you get to km 30, slow down.
I know.
I do understand your language.
Nuno, it's a suggestion.
A suggestion.
-Fuck that.
-Why did you say that?
Calm down, asshole, calm down.
-Don't speak to me like that.
-You're an idiot, like earlier.
What are you talking about?
What's up with you?
Sorry, this fog is making me nervous.
-Fucking nervous Spaniard.
-What?
I said "Fucking nervous Spaniard".
I heard that, but calm down, okay?
Calm down!
Watch out, Nuno!
Yes, Miss, this is an emergency.
A person's died in the Desierto de los Leones.
Yes, hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Yes?
Omar, Omar Cantu.
Who's there?
Who's there?
-I'm...
-What's the matter?
I talk to you, what's wrong?
Omar, I saw a kid.
It's over there, I swear.
-You feeling better?
-Nuno...
I'll go.
It's okay, your friends can come and pick you up.
I wasn't my fault.
-Calm down.
-Nuno.
Stay calm, you're not under arrest.
I'll come and get you.
You'll make a statement at the station.
-Yes but don't touch me, okay?
-Calm down!
Tomorrow you'll be with your friends.
Nuno!
Leave him, leave him.
Won't you tell me what happened?
I heard a woman in the street.
Last night, too.
I thought it was Agata.
Afterwards, she was shouting and crying in a sewer inside the drain.
Why do you take those pills?
-Why do you ask?
-Because they affect you.
No.
It's the opposite.
-Were you prescribed?
-That doesn't matter.
I'm not going to take them, calm down.
I won't if you go back to the house or that highway.
Sorry.
I need to talk to you.
What about?
What's the matter?
It's just that I can't stop thinking about her voice asking me for help.
When she called me, I heard everything.
The sound of the horn the tires bursting, the bashes.
That night we had a fight.
-Surely...
-I wasn't your fault.
I told her I wasn't sure if I loved her.
I felt pressured.
Do you remember when I started dating her?
I got to your house, I asked for forgiveness.
I begged you for 10 minutes.
And you stayed silent.
You just played along.
I could never tell her the same as I did to you.
I could never tell her I loved her that I need her, that I love her.
She knows, Omar.
She knows.
I'm sure of it because I know it, too.
And you're going to tell her when she wakes up.
You're identical.
Sometimes I'd like to imagine you're her.
Nuno was right.
We can get you mixed up.
Look Nuno and I don't get along well.
But he has a big heart.
And he loves you.
What's up, Nacho?
How are you?
Garciia Castro Mariia Concepcin has identification.
This is the morgue report, I spoke to the doctor.
She has been dead for around 23 hours.
She's been for almost a day.
The guy didn't kill her.
He was there about 6 or 7 hours ago.
-He ran over a dead girl.
-Poor guy.
He was so worried.
Let the poor guy go.
Did you report me?
I knew.
What are you doing here?
"An accident at kilometer 31... ..on the Desierto de los Leones highway".
Again?
Didn't I tell you not to investigate?
How's your friend?
In a coma.
Oh, kid.
Remember what I told you on the highway?
Yes.
We've searched for that kid.
I've personally been searching for him for 3 years.
There have been incidents the majority of which were related to young women.
They came in scared, badly hurt.
Sometimes they were reported dead.
They try to keep people from finding out.
They'd called them incompetent, you know.
That's why I keep all this under wraps.
Well, that and because it's hard to believe.
So why were there so many accidents?
Do you believe in ghosts?
Ghosts?
That's absurd.
I can only offer you proof.
You can make your own conclusions.
Do you want to know or not?
Please sign here.
Do you have a Biro?
A pen, sorry.
Here.
-Catalina?
-Nuno, how are you?
Better, better.
I'm just about to leave.
Apparently I didn't kill her.
She'd already been dead several hours.
Several hours?
But I saw her stood in the middle of the road.
Yes, I know.
I can't forget it either.
Something weird's happening, Nuno.
I can't stay like this.
What do you want to do?
Let's go there while it's daytime.
Maybe it's a kid who lives near there.
Catalina, I really don't think we should go.
Make something up so Omar lends you his car.
But don't tell him where we're going.
Catalina?
Did you see the notice?
-Which one?
-The one back there.
-For dry firewood?
-Yes.
Do you think "El Encanto" could be a town?
I don't know.
Why?
Because it's that way.
Let's go.
What shall we do?
Shall we knock?
Come in, child.
I was expecting you.
Who is it?
Omar.
Omar Cantu.
Afternoon.
Come in.
How are you, officer?
Martiin.
Or Ugalde, whichever you prefer.
Ugalde.
These are my darlings.
Do you like fish?
You're right.
Let's get to the point.
Come through here.
You've met my darlings.
Now let me introduce you to my obsession.
GHOST girl!
Coffee?
Why did you say you expected me?
I know who you are.
I know you have many questions to ask.
I also know why you came here.
Your answer is in a tragedy that occurred many years ago and that now concerns you and your sister.
My sister?
I told you.
It's not a coincidence you're here.
These are the only cases I could find from before 2001.
But when I did the first inquiry 25 cases.
But you were saying about a tragedy.
This happened many years ago in the colonial times, in a town near Mexico City.
In that town there was a young woman of impressive beauty who a Spanish serviceman fell in love with and cheated on using her to inbreed the children his wife couldn't have.
When she found out, the young woman went mad with anger and she threw herself into the river with her child dragging him behind her to their death.
Since then, the souls of the woman and child have been condemned to wander by the rivers.
Mainly young women are found with them.
The mother's pain is heard as she cries out for her dead son.
Some live to tell the tale others don't.
If this was true, there would be there would be ghosts everywhere!
Maybe not everywhere, but take a look at this.
-I heard that woman.
-Where?
In Riio Mixcoac.
Shouting and grumbling like you described.
Did you see the kid, too?
Do you have more information about the woman in Mixcoac?
Yes, actually, several cases.
"February 19th, 1999, Avenida Riio Mixcoac:
High school students reported having heard a woman trapped in the drains".
Why the curiosity about Mixcoac?
I live near there and my sister in-law told me she heard a woman around there.
I didn't understand but now...
But now you believe me, right?
Here I have a map.
Look your sister suffers pain that doesn't correspond to her.
There's nothing that can help her.
Neither prayers, nor sacrifices, nothing.
But maybe your sister could help.
How?
She's trapped between the two worlds but you have the bond with your sister.
So you too can see the other world and bring it to you and to those around you.
What worlds?
The world of the living...
-...and the world of the dead.
-Excuse me, but from what I know, it hasn't been proven that ghosts exist.
But there are people who say they've seen them.
Do you think they're lying?
No.
Not necessarily.
Only a sensitive and noble spirit is capable of hearing and seeing a soul in pain.
But be careful.
There are spirits that can transform what you see and they could help you.
But they could also trick you just like any person can.
But it's dark now and I don't want you to be in any danger.
Catalina, you can stay in the bedroom.
And you, Nuno, you can sleep by the chimney.
We're not staying, are we?
-She looks really trustworthy.
-lt was a good story, but...
-...do you really believe it?
-I heard that woman.
-Catalina...
-It's true, Nuno.
Agata is stuck in that world.
I can feel it.
She's telling me.
I dream about that.
Catalina?
Catalina?
This can't be.
No, this can't be!
Catalina, this is Omar, call me, this is urgent.
I met somebody who...
Well, you're right.
We have to find that woman.
In the drainage in Riio Mixcoac.
There's an opening near my house, call me, please.
Sorry I didn't believe you.
Catalina?
Nuno?
Hey it's dangerous here.
Here.
I'll go back in my car.
Catalina!
...the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God pray for us sinners now and at the hour of death.
Amen.
Hail Mary, Full of Grace.
The Lord is with thee...
Mystic Rose, pray for them.
Tower of David, pray for them.
Ivory Tower, pray for them.
Golden House, pray for them.
Ark of the Covenant, pray for them.
Gates of Heaven, pray for them.
Nuno?
What?
That day...
-You haven't slept, have you?
-I'll sleep later.
Good morning, guys.
-I'll make you some coffee.
-Thanks, but we're going now.
It's no bother.
I'm always alone.
-Here, you dropped it.
-Thanks.
-I didn't hear you go out.
-You stayed awake, right?
You're right in not wanting to sleep.
When you sleep you're more sensitive, more open.
Maybe it'll help to be close to your sister.
Ask her advice.
Sleep, and she will guide us.
Maybe you have to go back and meet that woman or her spirit.
Look further than your eyes let you see.
Sorry, ma'am, but...
-...what are you talking about?
-You have to be strong.
Help us, even if you don't understand.
Take care.
Fight.
Defend yourself.
-What are you doing?
-Looking at things Omar left.
-Where did he get all this from?
-I don't know.
-But I think I understand now.
-Shall I help you?
Didn't you want to see your sister?
Nuno thanks for everything.
I thought about lots of things and and I thought about all these years.
And...
-...
I don't know.
-No.
-Let me tell you...
-Catalina.
Not now.
This isn't the time, you're under a lot of pressure.
It's not a good time.
Okay.
Look.
Look at this old map.
The lady said it happened in the colonial times.
I compared it with an updated map.
Come on.
Look how small it was, the size of the central square.
The old town of Coyoacan was here which is now the current area of Coyoacan you know.
This is where the river is.
Look at the new map.
It goes straight down what is now this avenue, Mixcoac.
Of course.
Riio Mixcoac.
And this river crosses the Desierto de los Leones.
They cross almost the same points.
Maybe the lady was right about what she said about looking further than your eyes let you.
ELDERLY LADY TAKES HER OWN life
What?
Did you see something?
No.
I'm going to see my sister.
Shall I come with you?
Catalina?
Omar?
Omar, what's happened to you?
Omar, what's happened?
Omar, you're scaring me, answer me, please!
Omar!
What happened, Omar?
What happened to you, Omar?
Answer me!
Where are we going?
Omar?
Omar, answer me, goddamnit!
Answer me!
Where are we going, Omar?
What are we doing here?
Yes.
I'm calling to report a dead person.
Kilometer 31, Desierto de los Leones Highway.
No, I don't want to leave my name.
Message received today:
Catalina, this is Omar, call me, this is urgent.
I met somebody who...
Well, you're right.
We have to find that woman.
In the drainage in Rio Mixcoac.
There's an opening near my house.
I come to find you on the highway.
Call me, please.
They won't beat me.
You won't beat me, you won't beat me.
I can't...
I can't do this, I can't do this anymore.
I'm not frightened.
I'm not frightened.
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not in my mind.
Agata's with me.
I'll help her.
She needs me.
We're not different.
We're the same.
We are one.
Frighteningly equal.
I'm not in my mind.
Shit!
Taxi!
To the Desierto de los Leones highway.
Affirmative, it's kilometer 31.
Desierto de los Leones highway.
Affirming 84, highway 76.
20, over.
-What happened?
-He was run over last night.
Last night?
Where did you find him?
Over there, next to the shoulder, in the bushes.
-Did you see a young woman here?
-Woman?
No.
Please go away.
Excuse me, officer.
-What is the name of the victim?
-Omar Cantu.
Excuse me.
-Do you know who Omar is?
-Yes, I knew him.
-Who are you?
-I'm...
We were friends.
Of course, the one from the station.
I'm Martiin Ugalde.
I was with Omar yesterday.
-I showed him some files.
-Files?
I saw them, too.
There's something strange.
The river still exists, just like the lady said.
What are you talking about?
An elderly lady who lives in an old house near here.
-Show me.
-I don't have time now.
-I have to look for a friend.
-You can do that later.
This can't be true.
It's here, isn't it?
An elderly woman lived here.
But she committed suicide on the highway.
That happened in the 1940s.
She told Catalina to look...
Help me find her, please.
Catalina's sure she can communicate with her sister it's something they've always done.
The lady said something about asking for help.
And do you know exactly where in Mixcoac?
Yes.
Well, more or less.
Omar marked it in a map.
It's near her house.
Of course, I marked that map.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Why did you do this to me, child?
I'm not crazy.
Calm down.
Mommy's here.
Calm down.
Why did you do it to me?
No, child.
It must be around here.
There's the car!
There!
Don't move.
Miss!
Officer!
Catalina!
Hello, child.
We're here now.
I came to help, my child.
It's the only way to end this.
And to help your sister.
Are you ready to sacrifice yourself for her?
I tried.
I sacrificed myself for him.
But it didn't work.
It didn't work because the kid didn't die where the highway is now.
The river took him away.
But they died here.
My sacrifice should have been done here.
I now that know thanks to you and to your sister.
Who are you?
My kid.
Leave Agata alone.
Where's my kid?
I know where he is.
But leave my sister in peace.
Don't leave me here, child.
Don't be afraid.
I've been expecting you.
I'm sorry, Mom.
There's nothing to be sorry about.
Come, child...
Don't worry.
Don't be afraid.
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.
My child all this will be over soon.
Catalina!
Catalina!
It's me, Nuno!
It's okay.
I'll never leave you.
Never, never.
It's over, it's over.
Calm down.
-What's wrong?
-Where are we?
In the sewers.
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
Nuno, why are you looking at me like that?
-Who are you?
-It's me.
-Catalina.
-You're not Catalina!
Catalina?
Catalina?
Drop your weapon!
Drop it!
Now!
Nuno.
What's wrong with you?
You have to do it.
Nuno!
It's the only way.
You have to finish it.
Nuno!
Put the weapon down!
Nuno.
Catalina...
Everything I loved in life ended.
And then life itself.
What's happened?
Hey...
Hey...
Hey...
Where am I?
Calm down.
You're in a hospital.
What happened?
Where's Catalina?
It's a good thing you're here.
He woke up in the early hours with changes.
I gave him 15mg of Diazepam during the night.
Has he calmed down?
Where's Catalina?
Catalina is dead.
You killed her.
Don't you remember?
What are you saying?
-lt can't be true.
-What did you see?
Who did you see?
I have to see her!
-What's this?
-It's for your safety.
Until you get better.
You're going to need help.
I have to see Catalina.
Untie me.
I said untie me!
Where's Catalina?
Untie me!
Thank you.
Agata.
Miss Hameran?
Hello, Agata.
Where am I?
In a hospital.
Don't strain yourself your memory will come back slowly.
Where is he?
Where's my child?
-What child?
-My child.
My child.
You don't have any children, Miss.
-Where's my child?
-Don't get upset.
-Don't get upset.
-Where's my child?
Nurse!
-Where's my child?
-Nurse!
Where's my child?
Hey!
Are you still at the meeting?
I have cooked for you.
Call me back when you have time.
Seth, what's happened?
Your cell phone is always off.
Do you have an affair?
Seth, where are you?
Why did you take away all your belongings?
Why?
You can't leave.
Tea?
I get you some tea.
Look at you, is it worth?
I know he wanted to leave.
Don't you think you're a failure?
Why are all men like that?
Find him and ask him.
You have to find out if you've done anything wrong.
Perhaps you can go to his office.
Go public on what he did.
He can't just walk away.
Why should I do that?
(Today...
Seth left quietly.)
(15th February Cloudy day)
I have been looking for him.
I went to his office, the receptionist said...
Excuse me, I'm looking for Seth Lau.
Seth Lau?
He quitted.
I called him again, but it's his voice mail.
Seth, please call me back when you get this message.
Keep calling, it's voice mail again.
And again...
Why didn't you answer my call?
Where are you?
I think I am a complete failure.
How many times?
Three.
To be exact, it's the forth including this time.
Men would do everything for you before get laid.
After that, they change.
Why?
Men and women are fundamentally two different kinds of species.
Women like to be cared by a man.
While men like to care all women.
That's the reason!
Men are like that.
I care so much for them.
Even though they never appreciate, don't make it looks like it's all my fault.
I know I have a bad temper sometimes.
But I have changed.
Why did every of them dump me?
What do they want me to do?
What will you do if you find him?
I heard many tragedies.
All are caused by men.
Women would then learn how to take revenge.
What are you saying?
How can I make him love me forever?
Seth
Why didn't you call me back?
I have been looking for you for so long.
Miss, you find the wrong person.
Excuse me, I'm looking for Seth Lau.
Seth Lau?
There's no one called Seth Lau.
I'm sorry, you look very much like my boyfriend.
Today I saw Seth coming out from his office building.
Did you call out to him?
Yes, but he said he did not know me.
How could he do that?
No, actually I mistook him for Seth.
Are you alright?
You can't mistake Seth.
They look very alike.
He looks the same in my memory.
Then, where has Seth been?
I met him two days ago.
Did you see him?
What did you say?
Are you alright?
No way,
I just mistook him for someone else.
Yes, he's not Seth.
It doesn't matter.
Try to date someone else.
It will help you move on.
How?
Window shopping?
No, you have found one.
You mean...
You forgot something?
What are you looking for?
The car key is in the box.
Where are you going?
Are you...
(He stopped talking to me)
(12th May Sunny day)
Sir
Have you got a minute?
Thanks.
Do I scare you?
A little.
Do I really look like your boyfriend?
What's your name?
Ray.
And you?
Winnie Leung
Winnie...
Sorry.
Hello!
I am at a meeting.
Call you back later.
Bye.
Just broke up?
A few days ago.
Are you still upset?
I'll be fine if you talk to me.
Sure, you can call me anytime if you want.
I will call you.
Yes, please.
Paranoid is actually one of the syndromes of schizophrenia and dementia.
The disease exhibits various behavioral symptoms include agitation and aggression.
Patients of aggression.
just look like a normal person.
But they always have paranoids and delusions.
They hear and see people and things that do not exist.
They persuade themselves to believe in things that are unreal and unrealistic.
Therefore patients are always in a fake and tense condition.
especially for some unsociable and isolated teenagers.
If the morbidity of paranoid deteriorates, it will become schizophrenia.
At that time, it will be dangerous and difficult to cure.
Apart from taking drugs, the care from friends and family members is also very important.
(Things being written down...
will become a dream?
)
(23rd June Rainy day)
(I remember... his scrupulous face.)
(16th July Sunny day)
Hello!
Ray.
I don't want to go out tonight.
Shall we have dinner at my place?
I'll cook for you.
Yes, I am good at cookery.
Do you remember the way to my home?
See you tonight.
Do you like the dishes?
Very much.
Are the puppets made by yourself?
You are very nice, actually.
I mean your dishes.
Seth always complained of my cookery.
In fact, my boyfriend,
half a year ago... died in a car accident.
You mean Seth?
I'm sorry, I can't forget him.
I always have a feeling that
he's still here.
You look very much like him.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't mention him.
Why don't you eat?
Yes.
I understand.
I haven't been this happy for years.
If you are unhappy, you can call me.
Would you become one of them?
You scare me.
When did you arrive?
I have been waiting for you.
Is he the one you mentioned?
What are you doing?
What do you want to say?
How long have you known him?
Haven't you learnt a lesson?
Do you know what you're doing?
He said he wanted to see me.
No.
You encouraged me to meet him.
And now you forget everything.
Hey!
Are you jealous?
Don't yell at me.
You're not stronger than me.
You have never failed.
You've tried to steal someone's boyfriend.
Does he have a family?
Needless to think about this.
He won't be the same.
I know he won't.
I hope so.
(Will he become one of them?
)
(1st August Rainy day)
Get up!
Ray!
No need to work?
No.
Not today.
I want to stay with you.
I'll cook something for you, you can get some more sleep.
Do you know my hobbies?
We have been together for such a long time.
I like making puppets and writing diary.
What's the matter?
Do I bore you?
Why are you so quiet?
I'm just listening to you.
It's hard to find someone who cares about you.
Do you have close friends?
I like making puppets as I always think they can share with me.
When I am unhappy, I write it down in my dairy.
I'll feel better.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Not yet.
(Trust... when does it fade away?
)
(12th August Sunny day)
Off work so early?
You look so pale, what's wrong with you?
There must be jobs outside waiting for you.
Did you get the redundancy pay?
Don't be so upset.
You are so smart, I am sure you can find a better job.
I want to apply to the Police.
Sure, Seth has tried it before but failed.
He failed doesn't mean I'll be failed either.
I don't mean that.
Can you stop mentioning Seth all the time?
I'm Ray, not Seth.
What do you want?
You now start shouting at me.
You vent your anger to me.
I know what you think.
No oil?
(Once... he would do everything for me.)
(20th August Sunny day)
Promise me.
Don't leave me.
(And he once promised...
he never leave me.)
(3rd September Rainy day)
Give me two fish.
Don't cut.
How much?
60
Where's my $400 change?
You gave me a $100 note.
No, I gave you a $500 note.
Of course not.
I gave you a $500 note.
Check your cash box.
Are you nut?
Are there all $500 notes in my cash box belonging to you?
Give me two fish
Hi, how are you?
We just moved in.
Opposite to you.
We are Chan.
If you have time...
Such a weirdo.
Yes, very weird.
Day off today?
Oh!
Yes!
You said you'd apply to the Police.
Can you hear what he said?
What's the matter with you?
Why are you so cool?
Hey!
Cheer up!
Do you hear anything?
Why don't you eat?
This is your favorite, chicken with black bean sauce.
I don't eat black bean.
You said you like it.
What do you want?
You always quarrel with me recently.
Seth liked eating chicken with black bean sauce, not me.
What do you want actually?
You always call me Seth.
Are you crazy?
He's dead
Drop it.
Let's eat.
I'm sorry.
Let me tell you one thing.
The same day, two years ago.
Seth died of cancer.
I feel...
Why do you cheat me?
What have you said?
I cheat you?
How do I cheat you?
You told me that he died of a car accident.
Actually my boyfriend...
half a year ago.
died of car accident.
When did I tell you?
Forget it!
Don't argue.
You, yourself, can't remember it.
I'm right.
You're wrong.
Read it.
I wrote it down in my diary.
Don't accuse me wrongly.
I have written it down.
You even forget I write my dairy everyday.
(4th July / cloudy)
(break up)
(why)
(today)
(I kill him)
We should eat.
Trust me.
You will forget everything after the meal.
We leave together.
Please trust me.
You will forget everything.
We leave together.
Trust me.
Eat!
I ask you to eat!
Can you hear me?
We can leave after we finish the dinner.
Eat!
Eat!
Trust me.
Eat!
I ask you to eat!
Eat!
We can leave after we finish the dinner.
Eat!
I ask you to eat!
Why don't you eat?
Eat!
Day off today?
What's the matter with you?
Why are you so cool?
I like making puppets as I think they can share with me.
Hey!
Are you still at the meeting?
I have cooked for you.
Call me back when you have time.
Seth, where are you?
Why did you take away all your belongings?
Why?
Excuse me, I'm looking for Seth Lau.
Seth Lau?
There's no one called Seth Lau.
Sir.
Have you got a minute?
You look very much like him.
Hello!
Ray.
I don't want to go out tonight.
Shall we have dinner at my place?
I'll cook for you.
Yes, I am good at cookery.
Do you remember the way to my home?
I'm sorry
I can't forget him.
I always have a feeling that he's still here.
I'll cook something for you, you can get some more sleep.
Do you know my hobbies?
You don't.
We have been together for such a long time.
I like making puppets and writing diary.
What's the matter with you?
Why are you so cool?
Why don't you eat?
Enjoy the meal.
Do you hear anything?
Do you have a girlfriend?
No.
I cheat you?
How did I cheat you?
I'm right.
You're wrong.
Read it!
I wrote it down in my diary.
Don't accuse me wrongly.
I have written it down.
You even forget I write my diary everyday.
Today...
Why do you come to my place?
I don't know...
Why do you follow me the way home?
Just want to be friend and say hello.
What do you want?
I'm asking you, why do you follow me home?
What do you want?
Hello,
Ray?
Are you Ray?
Hello,
Ray, don't scare me.
I have been looking for you.
Where are you?
Ray, where are you?
Why are you so quiet?
Say a word!
Are you okay?
Ray, Say a word, please!
Don't scare me.
Why do you look so different recently?
I'm very silly.
Things will change.
I know I failed.
You don't care about me anymore.
Why would this happen?
Who did it?
You should know how to do.
You should remember.
Where does this stinky smell come from?
So smelly!
This sticky smell has last for days.
Here!
Oh!
This smell makes me want to vomit.
There must be something wrong.
Call the Police.
You say Yvonne Ho is the mastermind,
Why did she kill Ray Fan?
You better ask her.
We used to stay together
for a long time.
We have known each other for a long time,
as well as Seth.
Yvonne Ho
Seth Lau
I did not kill anyone.
It's Yvonne Ho who instigated me.
After I knew Ray,
we met Yvonne.
When did they become a couple?
When?
When did they become a couple?
I didn't do anything wrong.
It's Yvonne Ho.
It's Yvonne Ho.
Sir, I found a diary in the crime scene.
It clearly records the murder of the victim on 4th July
This diary also tells that on 4th July of two years ago, there is a man called Seth, possibly being killed already.
But this diary may not be used as a proof.
Why not?
Because this diary has been written up to 11th September, 2007.
Summon a psychiatrist immediately.
Also help me look for a person called Yvonne Ho.
Yes Sir.
Excuse me, is Yvonne Ho here?
This is Yvonne Ho.
What's the matter?
We need your help for an investigation of a murder.
Please come with me to the police station.
Seth.
What's the matter?
Please take a look over here.
Do you know the girl inside the room?
is she the Winnie Leung you know?
Yes.
I see.
Someone reported to the police that Ray Fan is missing.
We believe that he was dead.
The Winnie Leung you know said that a lady called Yvonne Ho instigated her to kill Ray Fan.
I didn't.
We haven't contacted for a long time.
And we haven't met each other for a long time.
I have no reason to instigate her.
What's relationship between Winnie Leung and you?
Just friends.
She is my ex-girlfriend.
Then what is your relationship with her?
We were schoolmates in high school.
She was your schoolmate and she is your ex-girlfriend.
Then what is the relationship between you two?
She is my wife.
It's been such a long time, it's ridiculous.
Let me tell you.
Recently, there is a TV news reporter said he wants to approach me.
He reports news for me everyday.
Do you know that there are hidden messages in his reporting.
He implies that he likes me.
This time, I will not let anyone to take him away.
Why didn't you eat?
I have cooked your favorite chicken with black bean sauce.
We have been together for such a long time.
You don't even know what I like?
I like making puppets and writing diary.
What's the matter?
Do I bore you?
Do you have a girlfriend?
No.
Why are you so close to her?
I have explained many times, this is not because of her.
Not because of her, then because of what?
This is a problem between us.
Then?
Why do you have to make it involve others?
I am not involved with her.
Nuts!
We have been together for ten years, you said I am nuts!
What do you want to do?
I've known her for ten years, you are now dating with her?
Who said I dated with her, please don't blabber.
I think I am very doomed.
How many times?
Three times.
To be exact, it's the forth including this time.
Men would do everything for you before get laid.
After that, they change.
(All things are not yet over.)
Of course, it's taken me years to put together this collection.
And just as long to convince you to give us all a peek, Marlowe.
Well, you know what they say, " If you've got it, flaunt it!"
I wonder what's gotten into John?
He finally steps out of the lab and away from his experiments and suddenly it's:
"Hi.
John Marlowe, alpha-male."
I, for one, think he's much more adorable as the shy geek.
How is it the most attractive ladies always seem to gravitate to you, Bruce?
Oh, no, we were just talking about these little hot dogs.
Now, Clea, I would think the curator of the Gotham Museum of Art would be much more interested in this.
Ah, yes, Emerick's Exponential Angst.
You outbid the museum for this.
It cost a fortune, but it was worth every penny.
And just how many pennies are we talking about?
Who's that?
What's he doing here?
Now, step aside, Marlowe, or I make your face resemble that painting.
John, please don't be foolish.
Should have listened to the lady, Johnny.
We've got him, Batman.
That's a broom closet.
There's no way...out?
You checked the walls?
Floor?
Ceiling?
And the blueprints.
There was no way out of that closet, Robin.
Maybe he was posing as one of the brooms.
Silent alarm at the Gotham Museum of Art.
A second art thief or a second chance?
The Batman.
Here for another glimpse at my disappearing act?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, and then we want to see you saw a lady in half.
There won't be any encore performances tonight.
And what makes you so sure?
Because this time it's two against one.
Piece of cake.
Numbers can be deceiving.
And so can I.
-Two of them?
-So it would seem.
Split up.
Oh, Batman.
My broom theory's sounding better all the time.
I know he took the paintings off the wall but believe me commissioner, I've triple-checked.
Nothing was stolen.
Nothing's even out of place.
Master Bruce, have you been at this all night?
So, any luck?
I recovered a hair sample from the museum's security station where our intruder disabled the cameras.
There was a match.
John Marlowe.
So you're saying--?
No.
I've known John for years.
He's a good man.
And has the perfect alibi.
He was saved from the villain by the Batman himself.
Unless he staged that with someone else to give him the alibi.
You gotta admit that two men would explain all that strangeness at the museum.
Well, some of it anyway.
But if you don't think he's our guy--
No.
I can't rule him out just because we're friends.
I have to hope that any further evidence we uncover will only prove his innocence.
Let's revisit the crime scenes.
There has to be something we've missed.
Bruce, what brings you by?
In all the excitement the other night I never did get a chance to admire your collection.
Come on.
We both know that's not why you're here.
Who can resist a mystery?
You wanna see the closet for yourself.
Guilty as charged.
Be my guest.
Readings are coming in, Master Bruce.
Interesting.
We're picking up traces of low-spectrum radioactivity in that closet.
And Master Dick seems to be finding the same radioactivity at the museum on the mysteriously re-appeared stolen paintings.
Thanks for indulging me, John.
Not a problem.
Closet aside, I do have an ulterior motive for coming here today.
-I'm worried about you.
-Really?
Something's different, John.
The party, the way you tried to take on that masked thief.
Even the way you talk.
It isn't you.
What's the matter, Bruce-y?
Scared of a little social competition?
People change.
I apologize if I no longer fit into some comfortable role you've once defined for me.
I didn't mean to upset you.
I'm sorry.
It's fine.
The truth is, I have been a little all over the place lately.
Oh, my.
Okay, still confused.
Marlowe's company has been conducting experiments in quantum theory for the government.
Which explains why he's radioactive.
But what's the deal with him not stealing stuff?
There's always an explanation.
The readings point to two radiation hot spots in the building.
I'll take this one.
You track the other.
-And be care--
-Please don't say it.
Fine.
Go.
The sign said authorized personnel only, Batman.
So, what happens now, Marlowe?
You teleport away again?
Is that what I've been doing?
No.
There's a much simpler explanation.
And it's right behind you.
Then your quantum technology isn't behind this.
That means all you had was an accomplice in the same costume.
Getting warmer.
Going up?
Ha!
-Enjoying the ride?
-Beats the company.
Penthouse level.
Nefarious plots, brilliant schemes, doomed heroes.
Have a nice evening.
You've been expected.
Welcome, Batman.
We've been waiting for you.
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am the Everywhere Man.
Batman's in custody.
But his partner may already be in the building.
-What's our priority?
-Securing the prisoner.
-We might need more men.
-Then we'll make more.
Okay, so my broom theory was way off.
Time to bust out Batman.
EVERYWHERE MAN:
It was the quantum field research, of course.
It led to the creation of the quantex.
With it, I can charge my body's quantum particles.
And replicate another me.
My energy duplicates can split at will.
But with the quantex, I can also recall them at will.
Even from a distance.
Which is how you escaped from the broom closet.
Sleight of hand, I know.
Yet effective.
Still that's only the tip of the quantex iceberg.
Please, sit down.
I'll stand.
Your device made quantum copies of the art at the museum.
Leaving me free to steal the originals for my collection.
You mean, for John Marlowe's collection.
-The prisoner?
-Secure inside.
They must have Batman in there.
Uh-oh.
Huh?
Hold on, Batman.
Almost there.
Hmm?
You're not Batman.
You're not John Marlowe.
You're just another counterfeit.
You're hot with the same quantum radiation signature we found on the copies at the museum.
And there was nothing in his past to suggest the real John Marlowe would commit these crimes.
Very good, Batman.
I was copy number one.
Sometimes it takes an upgrade to get things right.
Johnny may be a brilliant scientist, but he's also a fool.
He kept me around to be his lab partner.
But keep a duplicate around long enough and you know what you get?
Free will.
Johnny and I both loved our art collection.
But he wasn't willing to do what was necessary to add to it.
I was.
Enough with the art collection!
All this power and we're only stealing paintings?
-Excuse me?
-Who cares about art?
We could use the quantex to conquer the world.
Like a bad photocopy, each duplicate is just a little darker than the last.
-Shut up!
-Don't tell him to shut up.
Shut him up!
Look if you can't handle things, I will.
See?
Free will.
But I know how to deal with it.
And Johnny didn't?
No.
He didn't.
So you got rid of him.
I never get rid of anything.
I'm a collector, Batman.
And you keep your collection close at hand.
John Marlowe's in this building, which is all I wanted to know.
Attention, Everywhere Men.
The Batman is loose in our building.
You know the drill.
Divide and conquer.
Fill the corridors.
Find the bat.
Exterminate it.
When all is said and done, he is but one man.
But we--
We are an army!
Batman 's been spotted by the atrium.
All Everywhere Men to the atrium.
Oh, come now, Batman.
How long do you really think you can last?
It hardly matters how many of me you break.
I'll just make more.
And will they all smell as bad as you?
One more enemy will hardly make a difference against my army.
Yeah?
But what if I'm not just one more?
What are you doing with my prototype?
Check out my army.
How's it going, Batman?
Better now that you're here, partners.
Well, if it isn't old Johnny-boy.
I knew I should have eliminated you.
I always was too sentimental.
True.
You even saved the quantex prototype.
That's going to be your downfall.
There's a reason a prototype's only a prototype.
EVERYWHERE MAN:
Sometimes it takes an upgrade to get things right.
-Whoa, that's not right.
- The unit's overloaded.
Oh, it's worse than that, Johnny.
Your duplicates are unstable.
One solid punch, and poof.
-Ah!
-That's it.
It's dead.
We're on our own.
Suits me.
Never was much good at long division.
-Cool.
-You take the high road.
And you take the low road.
We've just run out of reinforcements.
-Let go of me.
-Quiet, Johnny-boy.
Batman may not know it, but the battle's over.
It's only a matter of time.
Did you hear that?
It's only a matter of time.
Before you're toast.
And before you've outlived your usefulness.
What's copy number one gonna do with so many of you?
Where could he hide a few hundred Marlowes?
And how could he stand the competition?
When the fighting's done, he'll recall each and every one of you.
You'll all cease to exist.
What if the Batman's right?
Don't listen to him.
Keep fighting.
Hey, think about it.
If we win this, we're toast.
Shut up, you traitor.
If one of us survives, we all do.
Then you won't mind if I'm the one surviving.
The quantex!
As long as he has it, none of us are safe.
You're playing right into his hand.
Don't worry.
We'll protect you.
But they all look alike.
How will you know who's with you and who's against you?
Quiet.
You want him to recall all of us.
Now that's a plan.
I'll get it.
Get the quantex.
We can't let him use it.
No!
Stop!
Don't make me do it.
You haven't won yet, Batman.
Two against one.
Piece of cake.
I'll create another army of Everywhere Men.
With the same result.
Then I'll recall it and start over as many times as I have to.
Eventually, you'll fall.
Will you please shut up?
I thought I could help people everywhere, but all I am is Nowhere Man.
John, it's great of you to donate your entire collection to the museum.
It seemed like the right thing to do after everything I've done.
But John, you didn't do anything.
Perhaps.
But part of me always wanted to be more like that other Marlowe.
Confident.
Cool.
Maybe it's a good thing that the only place I've ever been comfortable is inside my shell.
Any room in that shell for one more?
Johnny, you've spent too much time locked away with your art collection and science projects.
Stay out here with....
With you?
[CHATERRING INDISTINCTLY]
Of course, it's taken me years to put together this collection.
And just as long to convince you to give us all a peek, Marlowe.
Well, you know what they say, " If you've got it, flaunt it!"

Now, step aside, Marlowe, or I make your face resemble that painting.
John, please don't be foolish.
[GROANS THEN GRUNTS]
[E-MAN LAUGHS]
Should have listened to the lady, Johnny.
[GRUNTS]
We've got him, Batman.

Better now that you're here, partners.
[EVERYWHERE MEN GRUNTING]
Well, if it isn't old Johnny-boy.
I knew I should have eliminated you.
I always was too sentimental.
True.
You even saved the quantex prototype.
That's going to be your downfall.
There's a reason a prototype's only a prototype.
EVERYWHERE MAN:
Sometimes it takes an upgrade to get things right.
-Whoa, that's not right.
JOHN:
The unit's overloaded.
EVERYWHERE MAN:
Oh, it's worse than that, Johnny.
Your duplicates are unstable.
One solid punch, and poof.
-Ah!
-That's it.
It's dead.
We're on our own.
Suits me.
Never was much good at long division.
[GRUNTING]
-Cool.
-You take the high road.
And you take the low road.
[EVERYWHERE MEN GRUNTING]

[EVERYWHERE MEN GRUNTING]
[BATMAN GRUNTING]
[ROBIN GRUNTING]
We've just run out of reinforcements.
-Let go of me.
-Quiet, Johnny-boy.
Batman may not know it, but the battle's over.
It's only a matter of time.
Did you hear that?
It's only a matter of time.
Before you're toast.
BATMAN:
And before you've outlived your usefulness.
What's copy number one gonna do with so many of you?
Where could he hide a few hundred Marlowes?
And how could he stand the competition?
When the fighting's done, he'll recall each and every one of you.
You'll all cease to exist.
What if the Batman's right?
Don't listen to him.
Keep fighting.
Hey, think about it.
If we win this, we're toast.
Shut up, you traitor.
If one of us survives, we all do.
Then you won't mind if I'm the one surviving.
The quantex!
As long as he has it, none of us are safe.
You're playing right into his hand.
Don't worry.
We'll protect you.
But they all look alike.
How will you know who's with you and who's against you?
[JOHN LAUGHS]
Quiet.
You want him to recall all of us.
Now that's a plan.
EVERYWHERE MAN:
I'll get it.
Get the quantex.
We can't let him use it.
[GRUNTING]
No!
Stop!
Don't make me do it.
[EXPLODES]
You haven't won yet, Batman.
Two against one.
Piece of cake.
I'll create another army of Everywhere Men.
With the same result.
Then I'll recall it and start over as many times as I have to.
Eventually, you'll fall.
Will you please shut up?
[GASPS]
I thought I could help people everywhere, but all I am is Nowhere Man.
BATMAN:
John, it's great of you to donate your entire collection to the museum.
JOHN:
It seemed like the right thing to do after everything I've done.
But John, you didn't do anything.
Perhaps.
But part of me always wanted to be more like that other Marlowe.
Confident.
Cool.
Maybe it's a good thing that the only place I've ever been comfortable is inside my shell.
CLEA:
Any room in that shell for one more?
[LAUGHS]
Johnny, you've spent too much time locked away with your art collection and science projects.
Stay out here with....
With you?

Ten rounds!
He's got him on the ropes.
And he walks into a hook my mother could duck.
Here.

Isn't it past your bedtime?
Keep smiling, pal.
Who do you think you're playing with?
I got friends, pal.

You had him, you lazy P.R. Mari.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2006/04/30
Well, if you're here, he must be a VIDP.
Benton Williams, as in the former school chancellor.
We're on our way to see his wife.
What can we tell her?
He was drunk, and he drowned.
Smells like a Kentucky bourbon keg.
Any idea how long he was in the river?
He went in some time this weekend.
This gash.
There's something with an edge.
Something he hit on his way into the water.
Or something somebody slugged him with.
Hey, look, what's this here?
It's a transdermal patch.
Might be a painkiller, or nicotine patch.
Too bad it wasn't a swimming-lesson patch.
Home of Ben and Pam Williams Riverdale, New York Tuesday, March 13
I can't understand it.
Ben went to San Diego Friday for the Children First symposium.
He didn't check in over the weekend?
No, he's so busy at those things.
Do you have his watch?
A Rolex.
The mayor gave it to him.
Sorry, he wasn't wearing a watch.
What, what did, uh, your husband do for a living?
Since he left the board of education.
He lectures.
He has a column on values and education.
Seems like he was doing very well.
Who handled the finances?
Ben.
He thought I had my hands full making a home.
This looks like the Kentucky Derby.
Ben, he...
gambled on horse racing?
No.
Not even when we went to Las Vegas for a conference.
He didn't understand why people think it's fun.
Stop it.
Leave me alone!
- My kids.
- Mom!
He didn't want her prying.
This computer's locked up tight.
Well, his DVR isn't.
Look what he's got programmed.
We got racing, hoops, hockey, pros, college.
Not a home team in the bunch.
A sports gambler's buffet.
I guess he decided gambling was fun after all.
Two homes, two cars, two kids with college trust funds.
Gotta be a catch, right?
Forensic accountant's looking into it.
In the meantime, Williams called in sick to the San Diego symposium.
Playing hooky from his straight life.
And his even straighter wife.
When heroes fall, they take everyone down with them.
Yeah, along with their life's work.
You know, it's too bad.
Some of what Williams wrote, you know, it's good common sense.
The patch on the back of his neck?
It was scopolamine for seasickness.
Sounds like he was on a boat.
Yeah, a gambling boat.
Casino cruises dock near where his body was found.
Cabin of Ben Williams Casino Cruise Ship Wednesday, March 14
Here's his cabin.
Well, it's been cleaned.
Saturday after the ship returned.
It hasn't been used since.
Someone's been out here.
This curtain's stuck in the door.
Look at the ledge there.
Blood?
Maybe that's how Williams got that nice part in his hair.
You see anybody with Williams?
Two gentlemen left the cabin around 3 A.M. Saturday.
They said they'd put Mr. Williams to bed.
He was very drunk.
You know who these gentlemen were?
Our bartender might.
Yeah, my wife met Benny-boy in a buffet line.
And, uh, five hours later, he was buying champagne.
- He got lucky at the tables?
- Ah, on poker, I think.
Then he tried to get lucky with Jack's wife.
That had to bother you.
Aw, nah, nah.
Everyone's hot for her.
Yeah.
They get her going, it's less work for me, huh?
Less work, that's good.
So how'd you end up putting him to bed?
Benny-boy got into a thing with this kid at the bar.
We took him out for a breather, right?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
He was done for the night.
So we just tucked him in like he was a baby.
This kid?
Oh, some midget watching races on TV.
Starts mouthing off about this lazy PR Jockey.
- Now, my wife is Puerto Rican, right?
- Yeah, and hot.
Shut up.
So Benny-boy stands up and tells the kid off.
He almost tipped over.
The kid, what happened to him after you put Benny-boy to bed?
Don't know.
They had this O'Jays tribute band.
We were dancing till the boat landed.
Upstairs is hawking me for a break.
Those two any help?
They said Williams was celebrating a big score at the poker table.
His behavior, he was flirting with another man's wife, it's like macho posturing.
Binge drinking.
It's more self-destructive than it is celebratory.
Well, maybe he didn't win.
Maybe he lost.
Lost hard and suicided?
Find the dealer.
Get the straight story.
That's really nice of you, Joey.
Now we can get you that microscope.
Microscope?
What do you do with that?
Look at germs.
You going to be here for dinner?
I can take something out of the freezer.
- I got a game.
- Joey, you haven't even been to bed.
Daphne, I got a game.
I need car fare.
What happens outside the three-mile limit stays outside the three-mile limit.
You want to flip for the collar?
You want to arrest me?
For what?
For running a poker game for profit, what do you think?
Outside the three-mile limit.
You took the job inside the limit, with the intent to break a state law.
- Now, that can't be right.
- Try us.
And try getting a job with a criminal record.
Cabin C.
A massacre.
Five players, 100 g's each, winner take all.
Three got cleaned out early, then there was just Williams and this kid, Joey Frost.
- A kid, with a big mouth?
- A foul mouth.
All night he was bitching about losing a bet on a fight.
So what happened between him and Williams?
Williams lost his hundred g's to him in an hour.
He should've walked, even before he...
Kept playing, huh?
Got stuck.
The kid baited him, loaning him chips and winning them back.
He didn't just beat Williams.
He humiliated him.
Williams couldn't stop himself.
By the end, he was out 500 g's.
He told Joey he'd get him half by next week.
Joey went nuts.
We got him out of the cabin.
How did Williams take the loss?
Well, he tried to laugh it off, but a half million?
People kill themselves for less.
- That's what I know.
- Okay, thanks.
So Williams was chasing his luck.
You know, when people like that, when they get to the edge, they don't jump.
That's when they, they feel most alive.
And when they get stiffed half a million bucks, people like Joey Frost.
That's when they go nuts and push other people off boats.
Williams ran Ponzi scheme.
He gutted his kids' college fund to pay taxes on the money he took from his IRA.
Then he went in the hole another half-million with no way to cover it.
- He have life insurance?
- $2 million, paid in full.
And yes, it covers death by suicide.
So that's that.
He left behind just enough money to get his family out of hock.
Well, we're not sure he killed himself.
Friday night, he lost to that guy.
Joey Frost.
What's this, his first communion photo?
He's a very aggressive player.
When Williams told him that he couldn't pay, the kid went ballistic.
Looks like my daughters could take him.
See what he has to say for himself.
Lefrak city, not exactly hip for a 20-year-old.
His mother's place.
I called, no answer.
If Joey's a player, he'll be hitting those private poker clubs soon.
Whoa, bupkes showing.
15 more.
Joey Frost?
We need to speak to you about a casino cruise last Friday.
I'm in the middle of something here.
You guys want to talk, talk.
Well, it's about one of the players in your game.
Ben Williams. / Hey, I've played a lot of games since then.
The faces, they fade away.
You in or out, Wall street?
Are you sure?
Because we heard you were in a bad mood when you lost to him.
Lost?
Me, at cards?
No.
I was in a bad mood because I just watched this flyweight, Alvarez, who had this guy puking in a pail in the third round, flop in the tenth.
And then this whale, Williams...
Hang on.
My aces say 30.
He offers me a no-good marker on 500 g's.
Well, at least you got something for your effort.
His watch.
In or out?
Wall street, come on.
Think.
50.
50?
50?
You're going to raise me?
With what, a ten high and a five of hearts?
All in.
Do you mind?
You feel bad, Wall street?
Here, feel worse.
Eight high.
You had me.
- Here you go.
- Thank you, sir.
I don't know about your manners, but you've got a good memory for cards.
So maybe you can remember what you did after Williams lost to you.
I went to the bar, and I put my money on... hoops, horses, hockey, and Australian football.
And you lost everything.
Just like you're losing now.
Look, cards is easy.
Sports is hard.
FYI, I am the last guy who'd want Williams killed.
Who said anything about murder?
How many clubs did you hit before you found me?
All for a suicide?
No way.
That fat-ass died owing me 500 g's.
That's the real tragedy here.
See you later.
There goes one of nature's mistakes.
Well, seeing into another player's hands?
That's not a mistake, it's a gift.
He's not gifted betting sports.
Well, sports is out of his control.
That's probably the attraction.
Well, he can't seem to hold on to his money.
Say somebody staked him the 100 grand for the game on Friday.
They'd be entitled to half his winnings.
Including what Williams owed him.
If they knew about Williams' insurance, they might try to collect from his widow.
The college money's gone?
How can that be?
My brother's gone through Ben's papers.
Everything's fine.
Phil, they're saying Ben owes money from gambling.
Well, it's, it's a mistake.
I'll handle it, it's okay.
My sister's had enough bad news.
I'm covering his debts.
Family, you know?
What are you gonna do?
My catering business does well.
I'm lucky I can help out.
So you know the people he owes money to, mister...?
Lambier.
Um, no.
No, I don't.
But, uh...
I'm sure I'll hear from them.
Well, we'd be interested if you do.
He lost half a million on a casino cruise last Friday night.
Geez.
- Superior events, that's you?
- Yeah.
Ben's online checking program showed he wrote you a blank check Thursday.
He gave it to you as security on a loan?
You know, Mr. Lambier, I know about this, this gambling disease.
No, he... he took money from his kids' college fund.
I didn't want my sister embarrassed.
How much, 100,000?
That was the stake for the poker game.
God, this is stupid.
This guy on the fishing boat, that's Ben?
Yeah, yeah, he... he worked on a tuna boat every summer in high school.
I, I better check on Pam.
Excuse me.
You'd think a guy who worked on a tuna boat wouldn't need a seasickness patch.
Scopolamine, it makes you drowsy.
Enough of it will knock you out.
The ME found three bare spots on Williams' skin.
Possibly where other patches were stripped off.
They doped a guy they were throwing overboard.
Seems like overkill.
If they threw him overboard while they were at sea.
But if they wanted insurance to pay, they'd have to make sure the body was found.
So maybe they doped him to keep him on ice until they were close to docking.
This last backbreaking loss, maybe it was planned to make it look like Williams took his own life.
Whoever set this up had to be sure Williams would lose big.
So they brought in Joey.
Might be the same people who bankroll him.
Joey Frost, the invisible man.
No social, no bank accounts, credit cards, tax returns.
Cash in, cash out.
It's all about the action.
And somehow, he showed up on that boat with 100 grand in his pocket.
He was watching the fight before the game.
He said that the fighter threw up after the third round.
Would they show that on TV?
- Flyweight division, right?
- Yeah.
Alvarez...
Here, Atlantic city.
It started at 7.
It was an undercard.
It wasn't televised.
He had to have been there.
So the cruise ship left at 8:30.
There's a heliport near the docks.
If someone wanted him here in a hurry, they'd pay.
Look, you're over your limit by 40 g's.
Who you kidding here, sonny?
My limit?
Are you new, or just dumb?
Both.
You don't leave till you make good.
Here, talk.
Tell him what a moron you are.
Hello?
Who am I speaking to?
Sorry to bother you.
Yeah, this is Dom at the Bambino.
I got a Joey Frost here, he's a...
40 g's.
Look, I'll take care of everything, I'm...
I'm sorry for the screw-up, Mr. Frost.
Joey Frost, sole passenger on a chartered helicopter from A.C. at 7:40 Friday night.
Uh... the flight?
Paid for by Superior events.
Phil Lambier.
Williams' brother-in-law.
He's Joey's bank.
He flew Joey in to play poker with Williams after lending Williams 100 grand to get in the game.
And Lambier put his brother-in-law in the ring with a killer.
Talk about tough love.
Some people have race horses.
Phil Lambier has Joey Frost.
And Joey doesn't just play to win.
He destroys his opponent.
Phil knew that Williams was this hopeless gambling addict.
Phil wanted to protect his sister, and knew that Ben was worth more dead than alive.
So he flies Joey in to destroy Williams, to push him to the edge so that his death is ruled a suicide.
If your theory is correct, it still leaves one glaring hole.
Who drugged Williams and threw him overboard?
Well, I don't think anything on that boat, you know, happened by accident.
Maybe including Williams' drinking buddies.
Cops got nothing on me.
Hey, hey, hey.
Wait.
What happened to the watch?
What do you think?
I hocked it.
I told you I wanted it.
You want it back, I'll buy it back.
Just give me five g's.
Phil, I got a sure thing in the fourth. / No, no, no.
No, no.
Joey, you got to lay low.
All right?
No cards, no A.C.
No OTB, all right?
You are grounded, kid.
Benny-boy partied too much.
So we took him back to his room for a time-out, and then me and Jack went straight back to the bar.
You see, Jack was nervous about his wife, Dory.
You know, you leave her alone, she, uh... explores.
Well, I can see how that could be a problem.
Now, Mr. Costello, we have a problem ourselves.
We can't figure out why Benny-boy jumped, since... well, as you said, he was in a good mood.
Well... do you ever really know what goes on inside your fellow human being?
You mean like one minute you're talking to a good Samaritan, the next minute you're charging him with murder?
- Come again?
- You and Jack.
Last two people to see Benny-boy alive.
Only people seen leaving his cabin.
So if you have an idea of what happened to him...
Yeah, I, I have an idea.
I want my lawyer.
The door to the balcony?
I don't, I don't know.
What was my answer the last time?
You should have worked with me.
Now we're done.
Done?
Well, that's good.
No, see, it's not good, not for you.
Your buddy, Gil Costello, gave you up.
Gil gave me up?
No.
No way.
He said he was taking orders from you.
Hey, you know what?
Why don't you call your wife.
Tell her that you're not coming home.
Maybe she could pack up some of your personal stuff.
- My wife?
- Or not.
Maybe you could call Gil.
He could pack up some of your stuff.
He said that your wife has been calling him.
He said what?
Okay.
Uh, okay, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm prepared to, to give a statement.
Gil is the one who told me what to do.
Better you wait for your lawyer.
A murder beef is a serious thing.
Murder?
All, all, all we did was scare the guy.
Gil tells me Benny-boy owes someone, and they want to make him pee his pants.
How would they do that?
Gil had these, uh, patches to knock him out and then these other people, I don't know who.
They were going to work him over.
Just to scare him, that's all.
Well, the thing is, Jack, we found his blood on a ledge.
Uh, uh, I, I don't know anything about that.
When Gil and I left the cabin, he was alive.
Gil said he had strict instructions.
Instructions from who?
This guy?
I don't know who Gil talked to.
And you and Gil were together the whole rest of the trip?
Except when we were coming up the river to the dock.
Gil went to the can.
Like, took him forever.
- Gil get any other instructions?
- Oh, yeah, the kid at the bar?
We were supposed to make sure that Benny-boy didn't lay a finger on him.
Tell me again why they're called wise guys?
You know, the instructions to protect Joey, that could have only come from Phil.
Reel Joey in.
Give him the facts of life.
Apartment of Shari Frost Queens, New York Tuesday, March 21
My son?
If he ain't at the poker clubs, I don't know where he is.
Um, I can fix that TV for you.
It's okay.
He does it for his mom.
Cable bastards, they never come.
- That's better.
- Yeah.
Usually, Joey fixes things, but he hasn't been here.
He still lives here, though?
- Do you mind if I...
- Yeah.
But this is still his home, though.
Always.
I tell Joey, "no one loves you like your mother."
You don't know of anywhere else where we could be looking for Joey, do you, Mrs. Frost?
I can't think of any place.
But don't call me missus.
Makes me think of my husband.
- Call me Shari.
- Okay.
Shari.
Your husband died when Joey was young.
That must have been hard on him.
Harder on me.
He was missing a week.
They found him in a garage with three bullets in him.
I fell to pieces.
Do you know why he was murdered?
He was a bookie.
Ran it out of his bar.
He taught Joey to play cards?
Nah, he didn't want Joey gambling.
He wanted him to be a bookie.
Not a bettor.
You know, I'm gonna get you, uh, a clean glass.
So, the card playing?
Hey, that was me.
I used to play gin with the girls at the club.
Joey would sit on my lap, couldn't stand to see me lose.
I'd reach for a card, he'd pinch me until I played the right one.
How much trouble is he in?
Not him, his friend Phil.
Phil Lambier?
He made a man out of Joey.
Him and his wife practically adopted Joey after Pete died.
He even lived with them.
Phil okay?
He may have a problem.
We think Joey might be able to help him with it.
That's why we're looking for him.
Well, he'll come back.
I'm the only one knows how to take care of him.
Somebody else tried, though.
He has a, a girlfriend?
Gold digger.
Older than him.
With a kid, no less.
I don't know where he is.
He was gone when I got home.
He was supposed to be watching my boy.
Mommy, it's my turn.
Go ahead, honey.
Joey's been trying really hard the past week.
Staying home at night, picking Bono up at school.
Who taught you that?
Uncle Joey.
Did he leave a note or anything, Daphne?
No, he just told Bono he was going to church.
Joey's not even Catholic.
Is there a church nearby?
Saint Ann's, next to Bono's school.
Nine months we've been together.
Never once he lied to me.
N-40.
N-40
N-40.
Give it up, grandma.
You got nothing.
B-6.
B-6
Come on, B-6!
I'm feeling it.
B-6.
Bingo!
Bingo!
That's it, baby.
- Attaboy, Joey.
- Way to play.
Bingo, Joey.
I heard this big whale was going to be on the boat, so I called Phil.
He takes care of me.
He staked you the hundred grand to play, didn't he?
Did he?
You're not sure.
I can tell.
I got a lot of investors.
All right, well, there's one thing we are sure of.
Because Phil told us.
He staked Williams the hundred grand.
He's Williams' brother-in-law.
You didn't know.
I saw your jawline flutter.
Well, Phil flew you in knowing you'd beat Williams.
Now, why do you suppose he did that?
I heard Williams was a loser.
Maybe Phil wanted me to break him so bad he'd never gamble again.
He won't now.
Phil is not taking care of you.
Look where we found you.
You were hustling old ladies for bingo money.
Don't bad-mouth Phil.
I don't know where I'd be if it wasn't for him.
You wouldn't be here, facing a murder charge.
Am not!
You shut your eyes when you said "facing." You're bluffing.
If you don't cooperate, Joey, the next time I say it,
I won't be bluffing.
Williams was set up to look like he suicided.
Phil used you...
- No, he wouldn't do that!
- Or you were in on it.
I was just there for a game.
Come on, didn't you get the least bit suspicious when you saw Williams being carried out of the bar by these two?
- Gil Costello and Jack Rosencrantz?
- Who?
Look, if I knew that Williams was suicidal,
I would've glued myself to him.
He owed me half a mil.
I am the victim here.
Maybe that's what Phil wants.
He put you on the boat with Williams.
He left you with the only motive to kill him.
Phil wouldn't put me in that position.
You threw Williams overboard.
Shut up!
/ That's what Phil wants us to believe.
No, I'm not, I'm not listening.
Wow.
I can't see his style of bluffing going over big in A.C.
Well, he might be lying about everything else, but this tantrum is real.
I would say ten years old is where his emotional growth stopped.
With my kids, they either tell the truth or they go to their room.
A very small room, in Joey's case.
Yeah, but his father was shot to death, his drunk mother fell to pieces.
I mean, I...
that had to be horrible.
He was terrified.
That's when Phil stepped in.
Joey trusted him to survive.
Maybe he'll stop once I charge him as a co-conspirator.
That might push him closer to Phil.
If we release him, he'll skip.
So we keep him as a material witness.
Right here, in his holding cell.
I mean, he's not lawyering up.
So there's an opportunity.
- Hungry?
- Yeah.
Eggplant parmesan.
I don't, I don't like it.
You think I could get a sandwich or something?
How do you know you don't like it if you haven't tasted it?
Go ahead.
Here.
Tuck this in.
Go ahead.
Use these.
I guess you don't get a lot of hot meals.
You know, pizza, hot dogs...
Hand food, huh?
Like at your dad's bar.
So how long do I got to stay in here?
Until you testify.
It's for your own protection.
I got my own protection.
What, are you getting some action there?
It's my mother.
Not everybody gambles, Joey.
Now you sound like my dad.
Yeah, and he was a bookie.
You know, with a memory like yours,
I'm surprised that he didn't teach you his business.
He did.
When I was ten.
He had me memorize everybody's bets and debts.
We used to do it under, like, uh... code names.
So that, you know, I wouldn't rat anybody out if we got busted.
But he didn't see your real talent for the cards.
Yeah.
You know, my mom, she used to take me out to play gin with her friends.
One time, I won 142 games in a row.
So who was it that helped you move from gin to poker, Phil?
Yeah, he saw what I could do.
He would come into my dad's bar, and I place some bets, and then he'd sneak me out the back, go play poker clubs.
He helped you reach your real potential, huh?
And what happened after your father was killed?
Phil took me in.
He looks out for me.
Keeps you out of trouble.
No, I don't get in trouble.
You know why?
I don't cheat.
That's a rule.
Don't cheat.
Pete Frost?
Joey's dad?
While he was missing, his regulars kept calling to make bets.
All except one.
Oh, let me guess, Phil Lambier.
He didn't call because he knew Pete was dead.
They tried to make a case, but Phil had an alibi and no motive.
Pete disappeared the night of the Super bowl?
That should have been a clue.
Phil probably bet big and lost.
All the bets were in Joey's head.
In code.
Even he didn't know who bet what.
Phil's a prince.
Kills Pete, then turns his son into a poker machine.
He's been making money off Joey ever since.
If we could prove that Phil's behind this, it would open Joey's eyes.
The only person the detectives didn't interview was Joey's mother.
She was, uh, "indisposed."
No time like the present.
Shari, please?
How serious?
Thanks.
That was her super.
EMS took Shari to the hospital this morning.
St. James Hospital Queens, New York Sunday, April 2
I wouldn't have tripped if the landlord had fixed the floor, the cheap bastard.
Hey, Joey.
Why are you standing back there?
Joey wanted to make sure that you were okay.
I'm ready to go home now.
Don't, don't, ma.
They're gonna run tests.
Hey, I'm hungry, Joey.
Yeah, okay.
I'll get you something.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come on, you're not ten years old.
You can do better by your mom than that.
Come on, there's a deli across the street.
We're gonna...
He was really worried about you.
Oh, he has a good heart.
He has a good role model, Phil.
Like you said, he made a man out of Joey.
Thank you.
Let him develop his natural gifts.
Phil wanted to sponsor Joey.
Pete wouldn't hear it.
He warned Phil to stay away from Joey.
It's funny how it worked out after Pete died.
What I don't get, Shari, is, seeing as Joey takes such good care of you, how could you let him go live with Phil?
A stand-up guy like Phil, did he make it worth your while?
He did.
He paid me $20,000, plus a cleaning lady every other week.
Why don't you get her one?
It's a shock, isn't it?
What?
Seeing your mother in the hospital.
This the first time?
I bet you never thought you'd see her like that, huh?
Weak, scared.
What about you?
You ever think where you'll be in 20 years?
Yeah, I'll be fine.
You know, I met Daphne.
She seems like a good person.
And her kid.
He calls you "uncle."
Is that how you see yourself?
Having a regular life?
Hey, what's taking so long here?
What's all that?
You could feed an army with what's in here.
I got this for you, too.
11 years old and traded for 20 grand and a housekeeper.
I wanted to smack that woman.
Eames.
Really?
Okay, meet you there.
Costello's ready to talk.
Joey.
You know, you should know that the DA is working on those guys from the boat,
Costello and Rosencrantz.
If you know something, you know, now's the time to make your move.
I told you, I don't know those guys.
I was on that boat because Joey Frost told me he needed muscle for a high-stakes game.
So you're saying that he brought you on the boat. / That's right.
Joey's used me before, ask anyone in A.C.
I collect for him, keep an eye on people until they pay.
Did you keep an eye on Mr. Ben Williams?
Yeah, the guy tried to welsh.
So Joey decides to play hardball.
He told me to knock him out and put him in his room.
Which we did.
Did he tell you what he intended to do to Mr. Williams?
No, whatever he did to the guy after that, we had nothing to do with it.
All right, so...
Phil got to Costello, told him to pin it on Joey.
I hope you're not saying Joey has clean hands.
Either he'll roll on Mr. Lambier, or he'll go down for this on his own.
We're starting to get through to him.
You, you... charge him, and we'll lose him.
You tried to pull him out of his mess, detective.
Instead, he's pulled you into it.
He uses people.
By playing on their sympathy.
No more.
I mean, all right, so Joey played me.
You know, he thinks that I'm another whale.
So I'll just let him think that.
I need your help.
You know, you read people.
You know when someone's bluffing, you read me.
I need to know if a hunch I have is, uh, wrong.
Cool.
And don't bite your nails.
What's Phil doing in here?
Gil Costello fingered you for Williams' murder.
I told you, I don't even know Costello.
I'm being set up.
Let's see if Phil goes along with it.
My hunch is that Phil...
Phil's gonna burn you.
I don't think so.
He's not gonna do that.
Well, prove me wrong.
You've known the guy nine years.
Been watching him.
You know all his moves.
Well, that Friday night, I was dining with friends in A.C.
Have you ever met this man?
Do you know him?
No.
Never met him.
Does Joey know him?
Joey?
I, I don't think so.
Joey knows one thing, cards.
See, that's straight.
He's not setting me up.
He doesn't have to.
He's got nothing to do with any murder.
- You're sure?
- Yeah.
When he's bluffing, he leans in.
Here, he's sitting back, his eyes are blinking slow.
This, this is all straight.
Don't they teach you guys anything?
Friday night, didn't you hire a helicopter to fly Joey up from A.C.?
Fly him in?
No, no.
- Why, why would I?
- Now, that's a lie, see?
He leaned in, his eyes are blinking faster.
That's his tell.
He thinks he's protecting me.
That's why he lied.
You knew your sister was married to a gambling addict.
- Well, I, I wouldn't say addict.
- Right hand to the hair.
That's a classic Phil evasion.
- He's an easy read.
- The worst.
That's why he stopped playing poker himself.
But look, the point is, he's looking out for me.
Like I'm his family.
Let's talk about another case.
He's a good guy.
He's no murderer.
All right.
Okay.
I got to...
I'll bring you back to your cell in a minute.
I gotta fill this form.
What were those tells?
Leaning forward.
Running his hand through his hair.
He must be lying a blue streak now.
Yeah, but he's talking about something else, right?
- Some other thing.
- Let's find out.
It's common knowledge that the mob killed Pete Frost.
Guaranteed.
I had nothing to do with it.
He's, he's talking about my dad.
Why, why is he, why is he talking about him?
Investigators were wondering why you were the only one of Pete's regulars who didn't call him the week he was missing.
Football was over.
Okay?
There was no action.
But there's always action.
How much did you owe Pete on the Super bowl?
Nothing, I...
I didn't bet the Super bowl.
Is, is this on the level?
Why would he lie, Joey?
Think about it.
Maybe you had a better reason for wanting Pete out of the way.
You thought Joey could be a gold mine for you
- if only he was allowed to play poker.
- Where'd you hear that crap, huh?
Did Joey tell you that?
You can't trust what that little punk says.
You must have thought he was a sure thing.
You paid his mother 20 grand to take him off her hands.
So what?
So what?
I, I don't get it.
- Joey, look, look.
- This, this makes no sense.
You have a gift to see right through people.
Come on, what, what did you just now see?
- I don't know!
- All the tells, he hit every one.
Phil.
It's Phil!
What's, what's going on here?
What are you doing here?
- He raised me.
- He raised you?
He's kept you a child all your life.
He's been watching you blow all your winnings.
He's never told you to put some away, save it so you can quit and have a regular life.
He doesn't want you to quit.
He wants you to stay broke.
So you have to spend all your time looking for another game.
I'm like a son to him.
Your dad wanted to protect you from losers like Phil.
He killed his sister's husband!
Killing your dad to get to you would be nothing for him.
- I'll kill him!
- No, no, no!
I'll kill him!
I'm gonna rip his neck off!
- That's not what you do!
- Let me go!
- Get off of me!
- You got to tell us about Williams!
Forget that.
- Come on, you know what Phil did.
- Forget that!
You knew it before it happened.
You knew when you saw Costello and Williams.
And that's when you knew you were part of it.
And now you're afraid to go to jail if you rat on Phil.
Is that, is that what's gonna happen?
You want a regular life?
The one that Phil took away from you?
It's going to take a lot of steps to get back there.
This is the hardest step.
There's no easy way out of this for you.
You're gonna have to tell us what Phil did.
I... he told me to demolish Williams.
Push him to the limit.
And then when I saw Williams with Costello,
I called Phil.
He told me that, "don't worry about the money."
He'd take care of it.
He said, whatever I heard happened to Williams, keep my mouth shut.
He said that the mob was taking care of Williams.
I, I knew he was lying when he said it.
Hey, kid.
Thank you.
That's good.
Get up, Mr. Lambier.
You're under arrest.
It's gonna be all right.
You're gonna be all right.

TACTICS
DECEMBER 20, 11:50 AM
Hey...
Yes?
I'm actually here in Japan on a secret investigation.
If the Japanese police were to...
I understand.
I won't tell anyone that I met you.
Including my father...
Please excuse me...
It's just as I thought.
I also don't want the police to know that I've come into contact with an FBI agent.
If my father ever found out, he'd tell L.
Raye doesn't suspect me at all...
The police will deal with what happened just now as a regular accident.
Welcome back.
Good to be back.
What's the matter?
Why the big sigh?
Raye...
What happened?
I got mixed up in a bus jacking.
A "bus-jacking"?
A man who robbed a bank two days ago tried to hijack a bus.
Japan has become a scary place.
Does that mean you were also riding on that bus?
Yeah.
In the end, the suspect jumped out of the bus and was hit by a car.
Did the suspect die?
Yeah.
Probably...
I didn't have any time to watch what happened.
Raye...
Do you really think that was an accident?
What do you mean?
Well, you were on that bus because you were investigating someone, weren't you?
The criminal probably died...
Doesn't that mean...
Hey, you were indeed once a brilliant FBI agent.
But now you're my fiancée.
You're no longer an agent.
Don't say anything about the Kira case.
Don't get involved or take risks.
That's what we agreed on when I brought you with me here so we could meet your parents.
I understand, Raye.
It's just a force of habit.
Sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.
Once we have a family, you'll be so busy that you'll forget that you were an agent.
You won't have time for that habit to come out.
Instead, help me think of something that will make that father of yours like me more.
Oh...
Are you going to write down the name of the agent now?
No.
I'm going to write his name a week from today.
If he dies right after I meet him, I'll look suspicious.
It would be better to do it once they've investigated more people involved with the police.
For now, I'll use some more inmates to toy with L.
L.
There is another dying message left by a victim.
Please send an image to me.
Gods of Death...
"L, do you know?
Gods of Death. "
Does he want to say that Gods of Death exist?
Watari.
Tell the police to keep watch on the prison.
There may be someone else who will leave a message.
I understand.
DECEMBER 27, 3:00 PM
There sure are a lot of humans...
Are you going to do it here?
I'll show you what I've learned from all of the experiments and research I've done in the past few days...
"Experiments"?
Yes.
I've been testing different killing methods on the criminals in this area...
ACCIDENTAL DEATH DECEMBER 26, 8:30 PM DIES AFTER GETTING HIT BY A CAR.
Then, when I write a name in afterwards, it becomes true.
That's something even I didn't know...
He's here...
Right on time...
Mr. Raye Penber.
I'll kill you if you turn around.
I am Kira.
If you turn around or put your hand in your pocket,
I Will kill you.
I
- It couldn't be...
But this voice...
I've heard it somewhere...
I shall first prove to you that I am Kira.
I'll kill the man with the glasses... working at the coffee shop you are looking at.
T
- That's impossible!
Don't do it!
I had no choice.
I thought that if I didn't kill at least one person, you wouldn't believe me.
That man has been repeatedly accused of sexual assault, but the police have never convicted him due to lack of evidence.
He was a menace and deserved to be punished.
You may already have heard from L, that I cannot kill someone unless I know his face.
I could kill everyone you see here.
If you have any requests, I'll do it.
D
- Don't do it.
I believe that you're Kira...
Of course, you care more about your loved ones more than the people here, don't you?
Consider them hostages.
Y
- You know about her?
!
That's right.
I've been studying you.
I will kill everyone, including your family if you don't do exactly as I say.
You included, of course.
|- | understand.
What do you want me to do?
You have a computer with you, don't you?
Is there a file on the agents who've come to Japan?
My laptop is for work.
I always carry it around with me.
But those files aren't in it.
Then take this envelope.
First, take out the transceiver and put on the earphone.
A transceiver...
It's almost like a toy...
But this won't leave a transmission record anywhere and we can converse at close distances even underground.
He's thought this out.
Please take the Yamanote Line.
It doesn't matter if you take the inner circle or outer circle.
SHIBUYA
- SHINAGAWA
Even while you're on the train, keep your eyes forward focused on one spot.
Don't forget, I can kill at any time.
Once you're on the train, sit in the corner closest to the door.
If it's taken, wait until it's free.
First, I must tell you something.
If your answer differs signiﬁcantly from what I expect,
I will kill your girlfriend.
Of the FBI agents who have come to Japan, how many are there and how are they organized?
Please answer into the transceiver.
I've heard it's f-four teams... a total of twelve people...
Next, take out what's in the envelope.
What... is this?
Of those investigators...
Write the name of the agent who is directly in charge of you all... in the space at the top.
What is the meaning of this?
What is he planning?
But I have to do as he says.
He shouldn't be able to kill with just names alone...
Next, open your laptop.
You should be receiving a ﬁle from your superior soon.
A ﬁle of all the names and faces of the FBI agents who came to Japan.
T
- This is...
What's going on?
Now, like you just did, take a good look at each agent's face as you write their names on the envelope.
I don't understand.
What is Kira trying to do?
What is he doing?
It seems like you're done.
Now put the transceiver and envelope with the names on it back into their original envelope and put them on the rack.
Now put your hands on your lap and continue riding the train without making any movements for about thirty minutes.
When you are sure that nobody has noticed that you have forgotten the envelope...
get off of the train.
Why?
Why can't I remember that voice?
Kira...
Who are you?
Light...
Yagami...
Farewell, Raye Penber.
Raye Penber wrote those names on pages taken from the Death Note.
He unwittingly killed all of his colleagues.
Penber's superior died after sending him the ﬁle on all of the agents.
The rest of the agents all died of heart attacks after the ﬁle was received.
L...
We have a call from the Director of the FBI.
It's me...
I've just got word from Japan that all of our agents have died.
They all died of heart attacks.
I can only think that Kira killed them.
L, I'm very sorry, but...
The FBI will call off our investigation in Japan.
It's from Chief Yagami.
L, I've just spoken with the FBI Director.
According to him, you were investigating everyone here involved with the task force.
Yes.
What is the meaning of this?
Are you saying that you suspect us?
I decided that it was necessary to learn Kira's identity.
I cannot condone this.
I cannot believe that you would spy... on your colleagues...
We can't trust L...
Besides, Kira killed those FBI agents, right?
Even if they're not criminals, he'll kill anyone who stands in his way!
Kira's really just a murderer!
L. Another victim has left a message.
L, do you know?
Gods of Death... love apples...
Damn you, Kira!
Raye's... dead...
No, he was killed by Kira...
What?
A family meeting?
Even if I kept it secret, you'd find out sooner or later.
So I'm going to tell you now.
I am currently in charge of conducting the Kira investigation.
No way!
Dad, you really are amazing.
That isn't what I wanted to say.
Yesterday... twelve FBI agents, sent to Japan to find Kira, died.
Does that mean that they were killed by Kira?
What?
!
It means Kira might kill anyone who tries to apprehend him...
It's a cold and ruthless crime more fearsome than anything we've encountered before.
Many of my officers have quit.
Dad, you should quit too!
I don't want you to die!
She's right.
You should place your life before your job.
No.
I will not remove myself from this case.
I will not yield to evil.
Dad...
Dear...
Dad, that's admirable.
I'm proud of you.
If anything ever happens to you,
I'll see that Kira gets executed.
Kira will probably kill all who oppose him, even if they're not criminals.
We may all be killed by Kira...
Think of your lives, your families, and friends.
If anyone wants to be removed from this investigation, please resign.
If you resign, you will not be demoted.
I promise you.
I want those with the confidence to stay on the case to fight Kira, even if going after him means sacrificing everything.
That is all.
Hey...
What are you going to do?
Yeah...
Yeah, right, that's him.
I remember him because he said, "Get down. "
But I don't really remember the other passengers...
I see.
I understand.
Thank you very much.
If what I'm thinking is correct,
Kira could have been among those passengers...
If that's so, I can ﬁnd Kira along the path this bus takes.
SERIAL MURDER SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS HQ
Only five people, huh?
Six including myself.
No, I should say as many as five of you are willing to risk your lives.
I trust all of you who have a strong sense of justice.
W
- Wait just a moment.
L says he trusts us, but...
We don't trust L.
L, we have decided to risk our lives to catch Kira.
You should know what we mean by that.
But you never show your face and just order us around...
We cannot work with someone like that!
L.
If you want to work with us and want to catch Kira...
Would it be possible for you to come here?
Earlier, I said that I trust you all.
PLEASE KEEP WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN A SECRET BETWEEN THE EIGHT OF US.
I WOULD LIKE TO MEET THE SIX OF YOU, WHOM I TRUST AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
BEFORE THAT, I WANT YOU ALL TO GO OUTSIDE OF THE POLICE BUILDING
AND DECIDE ONCE MORE IF YOU TRUST ME OR NOT.
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY AND NATIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY COMMISSION
Why does he suddenly want to work with just the six of us?
If he's solved numerous difficult cases by himself, he should do the same this time, too.
And judging by the way that L has been conducting the investigation, he'll probably send a double to meet us.
A double, huh?
It's possible... |- | trust L.
I also think we need L's help in this case.
Me too...
L said from the beginning that... he needed the police's help in this case.
Perhaps you could think of it like this.
L was waiting for this to happen.
For what to happen?
There were people in the investigation who distrusted L from the beginning.
Then we had detectives continuously resign... and confidential information was leaked.
You can't run an investigation unless you trust your partners.
