Claire can't have kids!
Say that again.
We tried everything.
She was desperate.
As much IVF as we could afford, but --
Claire can't have kids.
How?
How can I have forgotten that?
Who are you, George?
It's not possible.
This isn't --
George.
George!
George, what's going on?
!
Are you doing this?

What's happening?

Please save me from the monsters!
- No!
No!
- Please save me from the monsters!
Please save me from the monsters!
Please save me from the monsters!
- George!
George!
- Please save me from the monsters!
Please save me from the monsters!
- Ah!
- Please save me from the monsters!
What's happening, Doctor?

Please save me from the monsters!
No!
Aah!
Please save me from the monsters!
Please save me from the monsters!
Aaaaah!
Why aren't there any lights?
I miss lights.
You don't really miss things 'til they're gone, do you?
It's like what my nan used to say --
"You'll never miss the water 'til the well runs dry."
- Rory.
Except, lights, I mean, not water.
Lights are great, aren't they?
I mean, if this place was all lit up, we wouldn't be worried at all.
- Rory.
Hmm?
Panicking, a bit.
Yeah, yeah.
Sorry.
Yeah.
Help me, please!
Keep them away from me.
Keep them away!
Aaaahhh-hahhh!

Panic now.
Ahhh!
Aah!
Don't run away.
We want to play.
George!
George!
Don't do this!
We want to help you!
George!
We went -- we went -- we went into the cupboard.
We went into the cupboard!
How can it be bigger in here?
More common than you'd think, actually.
You okay?
Where are we?
- Obvious, isn't it?
- No!
Doll's house.
We're inside the doll's house.
The doll's house?
!
Yeah, in the cupboard, in your flat!
- The doll's house.
- No, look, slow down, would you?
Look, wooden chicken.
Cups, saucers, plates, knives, forks, fruit, chickens -- wood.
So we're either inside the doll's house or this is a refuge for dirty, posh people who eat wooden food.
Or termites, giant termites trying to get on the property ladder.
No.
That's possible.
Is that possible?
Look, will you stop!
What is he?
What is George?
And how could I forget that Claire can't have kids, how?
Perception filter.
Some kind of hugely powerful perception filter convinced you and Claire -- everyone -- made you change your memories.
Now, what could do that?
Just a mirror.
Lock it!
There isn't a lock.
Ugh!
No-no-no-no-no-no- no-no-no!
Come on!
Argh!
Move, move move move move!
Argh!
Unh.
So Claire hasn't kids and something responded to that, responded to that need.
What could do that?
Well, I thought you were the expert, fighting monsters all day long.
You tell me!
Oi!
Listen, mush, old eyes, remember?
I've been around the block a few times.
More than a few.
They've knocked down the blocks I've been round and rebuilt them with bigger blocks, superblocks!
And I've been round them as well.
- I can't remember everything.
- Doctor.
It's like trying to remember the name of someone you met at a party when you were two.
- Doctor, the lift.
- And I can't just plump for Brian, like I normally do.
- Doctor, listen!
- Shh!
What's that?
It's the lift.
It's the sound that the lift makes.
George is scared stiff of it!
We can't stay in here.
We've got to get out!
Uh, how?
Take control, Rory.
Take control of the only thing we can.
Letting them in.
- Letting them in?
- Surprise them.
We open the door and we push past them, kick them, punch them, anything, okay?
Time to play!
Okay.
Okay.

Five times.
The lights, it's happening five times.
It's like one of George's habits.
We have to switch the lights on and off five times.
Now you're getting it.
What do you mean?
What'd you tell George to do, Alex, with everything that scares him?
Well, put it in the...cupboard.
Exactly.
And George isn't just an ordinary little boy -- we know that now -- so anything scary, he puts in here.
Scary toys, like the doll's house.
Scary noises, like the lift.
Even his little rituals have become part of it.
A psychic repository for all his fears.
But what is he?
Oh, my God.
Ah!
Gun?
!
You've got a gun?
!
It's not a gun!
Wood!
I've got to invent a setting for wood.
It's embarrassing.
Run!
Don't run away!
We just want to play.
Massive psychic field, perfect perception filter, and that need, that need of Claire's to -- to --
stupid Doctor!
Ow!
George is a Tenza.
Of course he is.
He's a what?
!
A cuckoo.
A cuckoo in the nest.
A Tenza.
He's a Tenza.
Aah!
Millions of them hatch in space and then, whoof, off they drift, looking for a nest.
The Tenza young can sense exactly!
What their foster parents want and then they assimilate.
George is an alien?
!
Yep!
But he's our child!
Of course he is.
The child you always wanted.
He sensed that instinctively and sought you out, but something scared him, started this cycle of fear.
It's all completely instinctive, subconscious -- George isn't even aware that he's controlling it.
So we have to make him aware.
George!
George, you're the only one who can stop this, but you have to believe!
You have to believe!
You have to know you're safe!
I can't save you from the monsters -- only you can!
George, listen to me!
George, listen to me-e-e!
Rory!
Doctor!
Where's Amy?
Oh, God.
George!
George, you have to face your fears!
You have to face them now!
You have to open the cupboard.
We'll all be trapped in here forever, in a living death!
George!
George, listen to me!
George!
George, listen to me!
George!
Please!
George, you have to end this!
End this!
End it!
End it now!
George.
George.
You did it.
You did it.
Hey, it's okay.
It's all okay now.
Everything's going to be fine.

George:
Who are you?
I'm the Doctor.
A Doctor?
!
Have you come to take me away?
That's what did it.
That's what the trigger was.
He thought you were rejecting him, he thought he wasn't wanted, that someone was going to take him away.
Well, we -- we talked about it.
Yeah, and he heard you -- Alex, a Tenza's sole function is to fit in, to be wanted, and you were rejecting him.
We just couldn't cope!
We needed help!
Yes, but George didn't know that!
He thought you were rejecting him!
He still thinks it.
But how can we keep him?
How can we?
He's not --
Not what?
Not...
Human.
No.
Dad!
Whatever you are, whatever you do, you're my son.
And I will never, ever, send you away.
Oh, George.
Oh, my little boy.

My little boy.
Dad.
Oh, dear.
Whew!
Must've been them tablets.
Oh!
Oh, jeez.
Was I --
Yeah.
Bernard.
All right, stay still, still as a statue, or I'll come and get you.
I'm coming closer.
Hi!
And closer!
Mwah!
Hello!
You're Claire, I expect.
Claire.
How do you feel about kippers?
Uh, who -- they sent someone, about George -- it's all sorted.
Yeah, we had a great time, didn't we?
- Yeah.
- See?
He's fine.
What, just like that?
Yes.
Trust me.
Doctor, wait!
Sorry, yes, bye!
No, you can't just -- I mean, you --
It's sorted.
You sorted it.
Good man, Alex.
Proud of you.
What, that's it?
Well, apart from making sure he eats his greens and getting him into a good school, yes.
Is he going to, I dunno, sprout another head or three eyes, or something?
One of the Tenza, remember?
He'll end up perfectly now.
Eh!
Be whatever you want him to be.
Might pop back around puberty, mind you.
Always a funny time.
Kippers are getting cold!
Come on, you two!
Things to do, people to see, whole civilizations to save.
Are you feeling okay?
!
Um, I think so.
Well, it's good to be all back together again, in the flesh.
Come on.
Now, did someone mention something about planets and history and stuff?
- Yeah.
- Where do you want to go?
Um...
Mind's gone blank.
Well, I have just been turned into a wooden dolly.
Excuses, excuses.
It's tough, though.
- It's like being given three wishes.
- Mmm.
The whole Universe?
Or Universes.
Ooh, three wishes.
Ali Baba.
How about that?

THE DAY HE ARRIVES
CONSTITUTIONAL COURT INTERSECTION
Youngho's phone is off.
I should've called before coming.
I'll just wait nearby.
I have nowhere to go.
I'm not going to meet anyone besides him.
What should I do for the few days I'm here?
I'll go sightseeing and buy some books.
Eat some good food.
Quietly pass through Seoul.
Nice and quiet.
Then back home in a flash!
Director Yoo!
What are you doing here?
- Hi.
- It's great to see you.
- What are you doing here?
- So nice to see you.
- How have you been?
- Good.
- Getting some coffee?
- Yes, with friends.
I'm meeting some students later.
- Making any films these days?
- I don't live here now.
Oh.
- You don't live in Seoul?
- No, I don't.
I see.
Where are you headed?
Just walking around before meeting someone later.
- How are you?
- I finished a play recently.
- It's called "Opening".
- I see.
Right.
Where were you going?
Just a nice place to smoke.
I think you can smoke here.
- And over there, too.
- I see.
I think I'll walk around some more.
Thanks.
- Great seeing you.
- You, too.
Stop by after looking around.
Thanks, I will.
Stop by later!
- Great seeing you!
- Thanks.
Youngho?
It's Seongjun.
I'm in Seoul.
I'm around your place, so call me.
I'll get something to eat and walk around.
So give me a call.
Youngho didn't call, so I came down to Insadong.
Had an early drink at an old pub.
Excuse me.
If you're alone, why don't you join us?
Really?
- Do you have room?
- Sure, join us.
Don't drink alone.
- Are you a writer?
- No, I'm not.
Come join us if you'd like.
You have a great face.
- I do?
- Yes.
He's cool.
- Cheers!
I can't drink much during the day.
It's twice as hard for me today.
I apologize, sir.
- For not recognizing you.
- No, it's fine.
I haven't seen your films.
- I'm sorry, sir.
- No, it's okay.
Not many people have seen my films.
But it's nice to meet fellow filmmakers.
Likewise, sir.
- I saw your films.
- You did?
Thank you.
You did?
I did too.
I drank a lot with the film students.
- You don't make films anymore?
- I'm taking time off.
Maybe I will, soon.
You wanted to quit?
Or were you forced to?
I'm not sure.
Does it make a difference?
What is it like, not making films?
Maybe I'm living like this because it suits me.
- Are we doing an interview?
- I guess so.
How many films did you make?
Four.
He really is a director.
- You'll probably see them one day.
- Of course, sir.
How do you evaluate your own films so far?
I suppose they'll be reevaluated, after enough time has passed.
- Thanks for the drinks, sir.
- Sure.
Do you want to go somewhere nice?
Where?
I know a great place.
But it's a bit far.
Want to go?
You guys want to?
- Yeah, he says it's nice.
- What is it?
A place you won't regret going.
A place you should check out.
That's what.
- I'm curious.
- Yeah, let's go.
- Let's check it out!
- Let's go!
- Thank you, sir.
- Sure.
Should I buy you some fruit?
Go on in.
Pick some.
Fuck!
- Why are you copying me?
- What do you mean?
- Aren't you ashamed?
- What did we do?
Why do you copy me and follow me around?
Stop copying me!
- What's the matter, sir?
- Don't fucking follow me!
- What the...
- Director Yoo!
Stop following me, you bastards!
What the hell is this?
- Should we follow him?
- Should we?
What for?
We shouldn't?
What's wrong with him?
Why the hell are we here?
- He was fine before.
- He told us to come!
Director Yoo!
- You can't see him now.
- I see him right there!
He's really fast.
What's wrong with him?
Did we do something wrong?
He's gone now.
Getting to her house was so hard for me.
Is she still living here?
It's been almost two years.
Are you here?
Are you still here?
- Who is it?
- It's me.
- Who is it?
- It's me, Seongjun.
What are you doing here?
I'll close the door.
You got a TV.
I wanted a big TV.
It's nice.
Having a TV makes it feel like home.
But I don't read much now.
Let me smoke.
- I'll get you an ashtray.
- Okay.
Thanks.
Did you drink?
Yeah, I drank a lot with some people.
You couldn't come here sober?
I'd never expect you to.
How is your health now?
Are you okay?
Did you know I was here?
- How would I know that?
- What if someone were here?
Who?
I'm sorry.
You came because you're drunk?
No.
I was too drunk...
I shouldn't have come.
I fought it for so long, but now I'm here.
I'm so sorry.
- Raise your head.
- No.
- Let me see your face.
- No, I'm okay.
Why are you crying like a child?
Crying changes nothing!
Face me and cry.
Look at me!
I need a cigarette.
You came here to cry?
You think I waited for you?
- Stop exaggerating!
- I'm not!
- I can't live without you!
- Quiet down!
I'm sorry.
But I can't live without you.
There's no one like you.
That kind of love isn't beautiful.
It had to be you!
Come here, my baby.
Come here, my darling.
You're driving me crazy!
My baby...
I've missed you so much.
- I wanted to hold you.
- I don't know what to do.
I love you, Kyungjin!
I'll never come back.
All right.
Don't worry.
I won't drive myself crazy waiting for you.
I won't call.
That's good for me and best for you.
I'll never call.
I won't do anything to harm you.
But I'll text you sometimes.
Just on your birthday or something.
Don't do that either.
Starting this again will ruin us.
All right.
I won't text you either.
Is it still the same number?
Same as before.
But this was nice.
I was able to forgive you a little.
Thank you.
As long as you feel good.
I love you, Kyungjin.
You should feel good too.
And live your life.
I just want you to be happy.
Professor.
Can I have two cigarettes?
That's too much.
I'll smoke these later.
So...
I'm going.
I love you.
Be strong!
ANDONG CHURCH
Hi!
We meet again.
Hi.
Still looking for a café?
No, I'm going to meet someone.
- How have you been?
- I'm not sure.
Not sure if I'm talented.
Just trying to decide if acting is right for me.
What was that play you did?
It wasn't much help.
I had nothing to do.
- Do I have your number?
- Yes, we talked before.
- It's the same number.
- Right.
If I need to cast someone, I'll call you.
It'd be my pleasure.
Be easy on yourself.
Just take it one day at a time.
I know, but...
Time is running out and I have to decide.
You'll see nothing if you rush it.
I have to go now.
Could I call you?
- I have some questions.
- Sure.
Bye.
- Goodbye.
- Okay.
I'm meeting Youngho at his place.
- There you are.
- How are you?
- Seoul is cold.
- Did you wait long?
- No, I walked around.
- Around here?
I had grilled fish at the pub.
It was good.
Smells like you had drinks.
Just a few.
Is it okay if my friend joins us?
Who?
She teaches film.
You met her once.
Who?
Oh.
- Boram, right?
- You remember.
You're meeting her.
We finished judging films and were about to eat.
- Where did she go?
- I came to get you.
And pick up something.
You're so thoughtful.
Glad you're here.
- Seoul is cold, right?
- It's freezing.
- It's okay if I come?
- Sure, she loves your films.
Really?
Let's go.
We had Korean food and went for drinks, to a bar called 'Novel'.
Youngho is so good to Boram.
He won't show it, but he likes her.
- You must be bored there.
- I'm okay.
I don't think I'd live in Seoul again.
- You're not dating?
- No.
Why not?
I did before.
- When?
- Boram.
- He doesn't talk about it.
- He knows...
- I officially dated once.
- Really?
Officially?
Did you get caught?
Yes, it was a big mess.
You're too scared to date now?
- It was a big mess.
- What happened?
He ran away and it was a big mess.
It was...
For how long?
I can't imagine doing it again.
Why not?
Are you scared?
Yes, I am.
It's not worth disappointing the ones I love.
I'd be so lonely without them.
I see.
I saw my limits.
You see them if you go all the way.
I saw mine and grew to accept it.
Now I feel at ease.
You should, for what it's worth.
It's the same thing as finding yourself.
Knowing your limit isn't bad.
But you could change.
You never know.
Pardon?
I'll wait and see.
Why would you wait and see?
- It's his life to live.
- I just...
I'm really curious to see how he'll live.
- Excuse me.
- You're here.
I'm sorry for stepping out.
- Do you need anything?
- We found everything.
You even got the ice!
I'm so sorry.
- Something to eat?
- We're full.
- A snack would be nice.
- No problem.
- Nice to see you, Boram.
- Hello.
You've heard of Director Yoo.
I'm not familiar with...
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
- Come and join us.
- Yes, I might.
I apologize again.
She's been out for so long.
It's so nice here.
Nice to be in Seoul, drinking with you two.
I'm glad you look better now.
Let's drink.
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
She looks exactly like her!
What should I do?
I'd like to play the piano.
- Go ahead.
- You play the piano?
I'll play something I know.
He shouldn't try to play the piano.
It's embarrassing.
Really?
But he's pretty good.
He seems younger.
He's full of energy.
He's a director?
Yes.
He lives in the country.
He's not making films now.
He's a good director.
I see.
- He plays well.
- You think so?
He learned it by himself.
Practiced for a month on each hand, then both hands.
I'm nervous.
Armpits are sweaty.
- Seoul is so cold, right?
- Yes, it is.
You lost a lot of weight.
'Cause it's a different lifestyle down there.
You look really good.
Don't you think so?
Thank you.
How long are you here?
- Three or four days.
- Have any plans?
Just seeing Youngho.
I don't need to see other people.
You two are so close.
- You think so?
- It's misleading.
How so?
Looks like something's going on between you two.
I see.
Feels like the old days with you here.
The night air smells like those days.
It's great to see you again.
You two are in love.
- You are, aren't you?
- Yes, we are.
Yes, we're lovers.
That's too creepy for me!
- What's so creepy?
- I don't know.
What's so creepy?
JEONGDOK PUBLIC LIBRARY
I saw a girl here and followed her home.
When?
I used to come here in high school.
What happened?
I got to her house and stood there.
Such a poor neighborhood.
Way up the hill near Miari.
- Was she pretty?
- Yes, she was.
I can still picture her walking ahead.
She went into a tiny shanty.
I heard her father's voice inside.
I just came back after a while.
Without saying a thing?
- I got lost in the dark.
- You got lost?
It felt like a maze.
I got scared.
"None but the brave deserve the fair."
True.
- I was like that too.
- You were?
I ran off too.
I see.
Men need to be brave.
I agree.
It's so cold.
Let's go somewhere.
It's freezing.
You'll catch a cold.
- Let's go.
- Okay.
- Can I really stay here?
- Of course.
- If you don't mind.
- I can stay at my brother's.
It's so far.
You'll get around if you're near the city.
Thanks.
What do you cook?
Instant noodles, but I should stop.
I have stomach trouble.
Hang on.
What are you doing?
I want you to be happy.
Don't be troubled by me.
From Kyungjin.
- What should we eat?
- Anything is fine.
- I know a Korean place.
- Sure.
It's pretty good.
You know Jungwon, right?
Han Jungwon?
Yes, he was in my film.
I'm meeting him.
Want to see him?
Really?
Where was he?
I'm not sure.
He won't say.
He's finally back after so long.
- He did business in Vietnam.
- Vietnam?
What did he do there?
He doesn't look good.
He gained weight.
- He gained weight?
- Yeah, a lot.
- Then let's meet him.
- Were you two close?
He was my first leading man.
He's special.
Such a shame.
He's a good guy.
He is.
This time they're being thorough.
Civil defense drills stall everything.
I bet Jungwon got stalled.
This is really great food!
This is worth the money.
- It's good, right?
- Worth every cent.
Good to see you, Han.
- Let's toast.
- Okay.
Hey.
Why do you call me Han, not my first name?
Sorry.
I just got used to it.
Of all things...
- What do you do now?
- I teach.
- Where?
- In Daegu.
That's good.
How much do you make?
- Not a lot.
- How much?
- It's a country school.
- How much?
- Seventy thousand?
- Not even.
Fifty thousand, at least?
Why do you want to know?
Why are you trying to hide it?
Still as petty as ever.
I'm not petty.
You're selfish.
Ask anybody.
How am I selfish?
You only think of yourself.
Come on.
- Let's enjoy dinner.
- That movie you did before.
You ditched me and cast someone else.
It wasn't like that.
Don't start this now.
You cast that other guy because he was more popular.
Didn't you?
I never did that!
Hey.
Because you promised me that role,
I didn't work for a year.
Then your producer gave me the news.
You should've called me, you coward!
This is ridiculous.
I did call you!
Only after you finished the movie!
Really?
- No, he has it all wrong.
- Bullshit.
I never get anything wrong.
- There's no mistake about it.
- Let's just drink.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
DAJEONG KOREAN RESTAURANT
You don't have a girlfriend?
- You're separated.
- I don't
- No woman in your life?
- Can't find one.
- No one you like?
- I have someone...
Someone I care about just as a person.
I feel peaceful this way.
Then why get separated?
Your wife is a good woman.
I forgot you met her.
She is...
I assumed you had someone.
No.
I just...
Couldn't sleep at home.
Hard going home every day.
- How long has it been?
- A while.
- That's understandable.
- But he has someone.
Who?
I thought you liked Boram.
That's nonsense.
You misunderstood.
She's just a friend.
You two aren't involved?
- Who is she?
- His friend from college.
She's a professor.
Very pretty, too.
Really?
- You're not sleeping with her?
- No, she's just a friend.
Don't go around saying that.
It's not good for her.
- I won't.
- You better not.
I care about her.
I insisted that we have whiskey.
We came to a bar called 'Novel'.
I ran into four people on the street today.
A film producer, a director, a music director, and a student of mine.
They're all related to film.
It all happened in twenty minutes.
Then what?
Isn't that so strange?
It's just coincidence.
Nothing happened, but it's still strange.
- That is strange.
- Right?
Nothing happened directly to me, but it's still mysterious nonetheless.
Good point.
It happened to me too.
Ran into someone three times a day.
You did?
I can't understand why it happened.
But it's very strange.
I want to know the reason.
There is no reason.
Random things happen for no reason in our lives.
We choose a few and form a line of thought.
- A line of thought?
- Yes.
Made by all these dots, which we call a reason.
For example...
Say I accidentally pushed this cup off.
Why was my arm here right then?
Why did I move that way?
Countless coincidences operate behind this action.
But we're only concerned with the result.
We make my clumsiness the reason.
I am the reason, but I'm really not.
True.
Too many coincidences are behind it.
- And more are behind those.
- That's right.
We can't help but make up judgements, but many untraceable forces are at work in reality.
That's probably why our actions are fallible, and sometimes lead to disaster.
I'm talking too much.
Not at all.
You put a lot of thought into it.
He's really grown!
Really?
Thanks, Jungwon.
I once thought that too.
I never heard it before.
It's so refreshing.
I really mean it.
You're smart.
- I'm sorry I stepped out.
- You're back.
We found what we needed.
- Something to eat, then?
- A snack would be nice.
- You've been out so long.
- I'm sorry.
This is Director Yoo.
Jungwon is an actor.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
I apologize again.
- You should join us.
- Yes, I might.
We should drink.
Cheers.
I hoped the owner would come out.
Please come out.
How many coincidences brought me out here?
- I can think of a few.
- What are they?
The air.
A man.
A woman?
You're ridiculous.
I'm acting like a fool.
- Give me a cigarette.
- Sure.
It's fifty cents.
Can't I have it for free?
- I'm joking.
- Oh.
It's yours.
Tastes good.
- Good, isn't it?
- Yes.
- Jungwon seems awfully quiet.
- You think so?
He's very articulate.
Talks his way out of anything.
Really?
- Better than you?
- I'm no good.
You're very articulate.
Better yet, you're smart.
You've thought your life through.
He's one of three big chatterboxes I know.
He is?
He's smart, but gets lost in his own words.
- Smart, but unlucky.
- I see.
Believes himself too much, but not other things.
Doesn't get along with others, but he's a good person.
I feel sorry for him.
Yes, well...
I guess you're right.
What kind of person am I?
I don't read people that well.
Tell me what you think.
I'm intrigued.
You seem like a nice person.
I do?
I see.
I think you're a nice person.
Thank you.
The first snow is falling.
I'm so lonely.
Wonder why I can't be with you.
Should I accept it?
From Kyungjin.
It's snowing.
Yes, it is.
I don't know anything about reading people.
But if you point out two opposite extremes, they all believe it.
This is what I tell a woman.
"You look very outgoing and cheerful on the outside,"
"but you carry pain and sadness inside you."
She replies, "How did you know?"
"That's exactly how I am!"
Mentioning both extremes is the key.
We fall for it because of our opposing tendencies.
Then what kind of person am I?
Well...
I'm not good at reading people, but...
You seem very practical and proper on the outside, but you're extremely emotional on the inside.
Does that sound right?
That's how I am.
This is creepy!
That's really how I am.
It's so uncanny!
- Are you really like that?
- That's exactly how I am.
- It's so uncanny.
- I'm sure it is.
Excuse me.
- I'd like to play the piano.
- Go ahead.
That would be lovely.
- But it's out of tune.
- That's all right.
- But don't make fun.
- No one's making fun.
All right.
- Can I watch?
- Sure.
I had no idea you could play the piano.
You're playing with fire!
Don't get drunk!
I'm going to buy dumplings.
Dumplings are great.
- Are you going alone?
- Yes.
It's late.
I'll come with you.
- Will you?
- Yes, I'll come along.
- Thank you.
- Let's go.
Wait.
Something wrong?
- Isn't it cold?
- Yes.
Let's hurry back.
- How long are you in town?
- Three or four days.
- Let's go back inside.
- All right.
We should get back.
Hang on...
What's your name?
- I'm Song Yejeon.
- Yejeon.
I see.
I'm Yoo Seongjun.
- Shall we go in now?
- Of course.
Hey!
I should take Boram home!
Okay!
Bye.
- Director Yoo.
- You again.
- Drinking coffee outside?
- I guess so.
- This is a close friend of mine.
- Hello.
- So you finally met him.
- Hello.
It must be fate.
- We should do one together.
- You're right.
Do what?
I don't know why I keep running into you.
No need to make up reasons for it.
Just take in these marvels of life.
This is marvelous?
It's just strange to me.
I mean like the "marvels of creation", not "marvelous".
- Like "what a marvel"?
- Right.
- What are you doing?
- Scouting locations with students.
- With who?
- They're over...
Where did they go?
We've been looking for locations together.
They're so prepared these days.
Well, we should go.
Let's go.
No, this way.
- Talk to you soon.
- Okay.
- Who was that?
- Just some actress.
- I keep running into her.
- I have someone like that.
- She's quite lovely.
- Is she?
We'll meet her again.
DAJEONG KOREAN RESTAURANT
So you dated someone "officially"?
- You're that curious?
- Yeah.
I'm not.
She was exactly my ideal type of woman.
What's your ideal type?
Someone who seems sharp and clever, but is hopelessly good inside.
She's full of emotions.
She tries to hide it in, but she can't.
So it bursts out sometimes.
Someone you can sympathize for.
This is so strange.
I think I'm like that.
I'm not kidding.
That's how I really am.
I think women are all similar.
Everyone has two extremes.
If you point out both extremes, they usually agree.
You know what I mean.
No, I don't get it.
But I really think I'm like that.
Well, everyone can be similar and different, too.
- What are you saying?
- He means...
It all depends on what you're looking at.
- That's right.
- What are you saying?
Director Yoo.
So you're not going to make films anymore?
I don't have the strength for it these days.
- You can't keep up?
- No.
It gives you will power and helps you think.
Strength is important.
You look strong enough.
I'm the one who's worn-out.
Why?
Are you tired?
- I drank a lot these days.
- Why?
- I'm just hurting a bit.
- What's wrong?
I have some sorrow in my heart.
I see.
She was walking her dog and it got lost.
- She looked everywhere.
- How long did you raise it?
She really loved that dog.
She put up missing posters and offered a big reward, but she couldn't find it.
His name is Rookie.
I'm all that he has.
He must miss home so much.
He must want to come back to his warm house, and miss being held in my arms.
He...
He...
He has no one else but me.
He must be so sad and cold.
Boram.
- Boram?
- Yeah...
Don't start crying again.
Is it that hard for you?
No, I'm okay.
No...
I'll be fine.
- Thank you.
- Silly girl.
Stop crying.
Stop!
Come on.
But he must miss home so much.
I had a dog too, so I understand.
- Oh, you do?
- Yes, a little.
We went to a bar called 'Novel' for Boram.
She's an emotional woman, unlike what she seems.
This bar is so empty.
- Even the owner isn't here.
- She'll be here soon.
Do you know her well?
- She's strange.
- How so?
Why is she out this long?
Isn't she afraid of people stealing things?
That makes sense.
She had a surprisingly hard life.
She's pretty, but...
I don't think she's had a happy life.
She shouldn't be out so long.
- She sleeps here too?
- If it gets late sometimes.
There's a room inside.
- There's a room?
- Yeah.
What's her story?
Bad luck with men.
The usual.
But I can't talk about it.
It's her privacy.
I bet she's met a lot of men.
She did, and she still does.
But I'm not sure.
I think she's seen a few.
Life gets boring alone.
Long nights with nothing to do.
- How many men?
- She dates a few.
The men aren't too serious about it.
Mostly well-mannered, older men.
She's really pretty, isn't she?
Yes, she is.
- More than me?
- No.
She can't compare.
Why not?
You're completely different, because you're special to me.
- What's special about me?
- You?
Well...
You're good.
You're very talented.
You have many things others only dream of, so just thank your parents.
Stop drinking and complaining for no reason.
I look like I have lots to be thankful for?
- You do.
- You're bursting with talent!
Just believe what I tell you!
Don't suspect it!
Stop doing that!
I really mean it!
Why are you yelling at me?
I understood you.
But I'm lonely.
I'm just so sad.
I really am.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I'll do better.
I will.
I'm sorry for stepping out.
You shouldn't be gone for so long!
I'm very sorry...
Would you like something to eat?
Yes, we're a bit hungry.
- All right.
- You know Director Yoo.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I apologize again.
Why does she wander around this late?
Let's drink.
Yes, cheers.
Boram was harsh on her.
She must be upset.
I'm going to the store to buy some food.
You are?
I thought we had some left...
I apologize.
Walk safe.
I must be cursed.
I cut loose all the men for you, and now I'm pure.
Don't push me away.
Can't we save goodbyes for later?
From Kyungjin.
I'm sorry.
I think I was too drunk.
What do you mean?
I shouldn't have done that.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't remember a thing.
You don't?
No.
How long are you in Seoul?
I'm not sure right now.
I'll come back.
Wait for me.
Wait at the bar.
I'll come right back.
Back to the bar?
I have to go home.
Wait for me, okay?
Wait for me.
Okay.
You'll wait for me?
Yes, honey.
I'll wait.
Thanks.
Honey.
You'll come back to me?
I'll be back soon.
I'll send them off and come back.
Okay, honey.
Let's get back.
They're waiting.
All right.
Director Yoo.
I'm going to keep my eye on you.
I'm going to watch how you change.
All right.
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
I hope you accomplish what you mentioned.
I don't think I'm capable.
Then you shouldn't say that.
Let's go.
- Let's go, Boram.
- Okay.
Let's go.
Honey.
Is there a room here?
Yes, over here.
- They all went home?
- Yeah, they did.
Can I go in?
Would you like to?
- But it's messy inside.
- That's all right.
- You look so tired, honey.
- I do?
- Why are you so nice to me?
- You're so good.
- I didn't think we'd hit it off.
- Why not?
You're too manly.
- You're a real man.
- No, I'm not.
You're so pretty.
You were so charismatic when I first saw you.
I want you to be happy.
I mean it.
Thank you.
Am I pretty?
Yes.
I feel like I know you.
You're an angel on the inside.
I don't think you know me.
You don't think so?
You think I'm better than I really am.
There are many different sides of me.
I feel like I know who you are.
You're a good person, silly.
I don't express things well at first.
But with you,
I think that...
I can have the kind of love I've hoped for.
No one...
No one looks at me the way you do.
I mean it.
I don't think anyone ever has.
I love you.
I want you to be happy.
I want to make you happy.
Thank you.
Stay inside.
It's cold.
I'll just see you go.
Keep those three promises.
I will.
Just trust me on this.
Tell me what you promised me.
First, meets lots of nice people.
And you can't ever let them get away.
- What else?
- Second, don't get drunk.
- What else?
- The third thing was...
- The third was...
- You already forgot?
- A diary.
- That's right.
- Writing every day.
- You have to.
- Even just three lines a day.
- I will.
I should go.
Can I have your number?
So I can text you when I miss you.
I know, but...
You know we shouldn't meet again.
I know.
I don't even have your number.
I hope you believe me.
I know saying goodbye is best for us.
I believe you.
I have a nice memory to cherish now.
Thank you.
Have a happy life, honey.
I'm not sure you can stand saying goodbye.
Yeah...
You have to be strong.
Trust me.
And keep those promises.
It'll be good for me.
I promise to meet someone good.
I'll go now.
- Go before the cleaning lady comes.
- All right.
Bye.
- Hello?
- Youngho?
- I'm around your place.
- You are?
But I'm kind of busy right now.
You are?
What are you doing?
Taking care of things before the year ends.
Well, I'll be nearby...
- But you sound tired.
- I do?
I am pretty tired.
All right, then...
- Call me when you're done.
- Okay, I will.
- Call me.
- All right.
Hello.
- Hi.
- Hello.
It's been a while.
- Setting up for a shoot?
- Something like that.
I see.
- Good luck with the shoot.
- Thanks.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
He used to be nice to me.
Look who it is.
- Long time no see.
- Hello.
How have you been?
I'm just taking things slow.
- Times are hard for everyone.
- Right.
So...
- What about you?
- I'm taking it slow too.
No need to rush it.
- You've got talent.
- Thank you.
So you've been well?
Sure.
- Let's work together sometime.
- Yes, sir.
Is it going to snow?
It already is!
Perfect day for a drink.
I hear you.
See you around, then.
Director Yoo!
I thought it was you.
It's me!
Do you remember?
Sure.
- How are you these days?
- I'm just teaching.
Teaching...
- Not making films?
- Well, no...
- I want to see your next film.
- Right.
- What do you do?
- Me?
Just some TV work these days.
- I released a children's album.
- I see.
Compiled some songs that I had done.
Oh.
- Could I get your number?
- Here, let me.
Who is he?
He does music...
Okay, then.
Great seeing you.
Thanks for your number.
- I'll call you.
- Okay.
Yes?
- Hello.
- Hello.
Do I know you?
I'm a fan.
I saw all your films.
- Thank you so much.
- All four of them.
Why aren't you making more?
Well, since I live in the country now.
I see.
- What do you do?
- I take pictures.
- It's a hobby of mine.
- I see.
- It's like my diary.
- That's great.
Would you let me take a picture of you?
I don't like taking pictures.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
- Over here seems nice.
- Okay.
- Here?
- Yes.
- Lean back comfortably.
- Okay.

I was able to forgive you a little.
Thank you
As long as you feel good.
I love you, Kyungjin.

ANDONG CHURCH

Hi.
Still looking for a cafe?
No, I'm going to meet someone.
- How have you been?
- l'm not sure
Not sure if I'm talented
Just tying to decide if acting is right for me.
What was that play you did?
It wasn't much help.
I had nothing to do
- Do I have your number?
- Yes, we talked before
- It's the same number.
- Right.
If I need to cast someone, I'll call you lt'd be my pleasure
Be easy on yourself.
Just take it one day at a time.
I know, but...
Time is running out and I have to decide.
You'll see nothing ifyou rush it.
I have to go now.
Could I call you?
- l have some questions.
- Sure.
Bye.
- Goodbye.
- Okay.
I'm meeting Youngho at his place.
- There you are.
- How are you?
Seoul is so cold.
Did you wait long?
- No, I walked around.
- Around here?
I had grilled fish at the pub.
It was good.
Smells like you had drinks.
Just a few.
is it okay if my friend joins us?
Who?
She teaches film
You met her once
Who?
- Boram, right?
- You remember.
You're meeting her
We finished judging films and were about to eat.
- Where did she go?
- l came to get you.
And pick up something.
You're so thoughtful.
Glad you're here

- It's freezing.
- It's okay if I come?
- Sure she loves your films.
Really?
Let's go
We had Korean food and wentfor drinks, to a bar called 'Novel'
Youngho is so good to Boram.
He won't show it, but he likes her.
- You must be bored there.
- l'm okay.
I don't think I'd live in Seoul again.
- You're not dating?
- No.
Why not?
I did before.
- When?
- Boram
- He doesn't talk about it.
- He knows...
- l officially dated once.
- Really?
Officially?
Did you get caught?
Yes, it was a big mess.
You're too scared to date now?
- It was a big mess.
- What happened?
He ran away and it was a big mess.
It was...
For how long?
I can't imagine doing it again
Why not?
Are you scared?
Yes, I am lt's not worth disappointing the ones I love.
I'd be so lonely without them.
I see.
I saw my limits
You see them ifyou go all the way.
I saw mine and grew to accept it
Now I feel at ease.
You should, for what it's worth.
It's the same thing as finding yourself.
Knowing your limit isn't bad
But you could change.
You never know.
Pardon?
I'll wait and see
Why would you wait and see?
- It's his life to live.
- l just... I'm really curious to see how he'll live.
- Excuse me.
- You're here.
I'm sory for stepping out.
- Do you need anything?
- We found evemhing
You even got the ice!
I'm so sory.
- Something to eat?
- We're full.
A snack would be nice.
No problem.
- Nice to see you, Boram.
- Hello
You've heard of Director Yoo.
I'm not familiar with...
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

Nice to be in Seoul, drinking with you mo.
I'm glad you look better now.
Let's drink

- Cheers!
She looks exactly like her!
What should I do?
I'd like to play the piano.
- Go ahead.
- You play the piano?
I'll play something I know.
He shouldn't ty to play the piano.
It's embarrassing.
Really?
But he's prem good.
He seems younger.
He's full of energy.
He's a director?
Yes.
He lives in the county
He's not making films now
He's a good director I see.
- He plays well.
- You think so?
He learned it by himself
Practiced for a month on each hand, then both hands
I'm nervous.
Armpits are sweaty.
- Seoul is so cold, right?
- Yes, it is
You lost a lot ofweight.
Cause it's a different lifestyle down there.
You look really good
Don't you think so, Youngho?
Thank you
How long are you here?
- Three or four days.
- Have any plans?
Just seeing Youngho I don't need to see other people.
You mo are so close.
- You think so?
- It's misleading.
How so?
Looks like something's going on bemeen you mo l see.
Feels like the old days with you here
The night air smells like those days.
It's great to see you again.
You mo are in love
- You are, aren't you?
- Yes, we are.
Yes, we're lovers
That's too creepy for me!
- What's so creepy?
- l don't know.
What's so creepy?
JEONGDOK PUBLIC LIBRARY
I saw a girl here and followed her home
When?
I used to come here in high school.
What happened?
I got to her house and stood there
Such a poor neighborhood
Way up the hill near Miari.
- Was she prem?
- Yes, she was.
I can still picture her walking ahead.
She went into a tiny shanty I heard her father's voice inside I just came back aRer a while
Without saying a thing?
I got lost in the dark.
You got lost?
It felt like a maze.
I got scared.
"None but the brave deserve the fair."
True
- l was like that too.
- You were?
I ran offtoo I see
Men need to be brave.
I agree lt's so cold.
Let's go somewhere lt's freezing.
You'll catch a cold.
- Let's go.
- Okay.
- Can I really stay here?
- Of course.
Ifyou don't mind I can stay at my brother's lt's so far
You'll get around ifyou're near the city.
Thanks.
What do you cook?
Instant noodles, but I should stop.
I have stomach trouble.
Hang on
What are you doing?
I want you to be happy
Don't be troubled by me From Kyun\code(01f5)jin.
- What should we eat?
- Anything is fine.
- l know a Korean place.
- Sure.
It's prem good
You know Jungwon, right?
Han Jungwon?
He was in my film.
I'm meeting him.
Want to see him?
Really?
Where was he?
I'm not sure.
He won't say.
He's finally back aRer so long.
- He did business in Vietnam.
- Vietnam?
What did he do there?
He doesn't look good.
He gained weight
- He gained weight?
- Yeah, a lot
- Then let's meet him.
- Were you mo close?
He was my first leading man.
He's special.
Such a shame.
He's a good guy
He is.
This time they're being thorough.
Civil defense drills stall evemhing.
I bet Jungwon got stalled
This is really great food!
This is worth the money.
It's good, right?
Worth evey cent
Good to see you, Han.
- Let's toast.
- Okay.
Hey Why do you call me Han, not my first name?
Sory. I just got used to it.
Of all things...
- What do you do now?
- l teach.
- Where?
- In Daegu
That's good.
How much do you make?
- Not a lot.
- How much?
- It's a county school.
- How much?
- Seventy thousand?
- Not even.
Fim thousand, at least?
Why do you want to know?
Why are you tying to hide it?
Still as pem as ever.
I'm not pem.
You're selfish.
Ask anybody
How am I selfish?
You only think ofyourself.
Come on, Let's enjoy dinner.
That movie you did before
You ditched me and cast someone else lt wasn't like that.
Don't start this now.
You cast that other guy because he was more popular.
Didn't you?
I never did that!
Hey, Because you promised me that role I didn't work for a year.
Then your producer gave me the news
You should've called me, you coward!
This is ridiculous I did call you!
Only aRer you finished the movie!
Really?
No, he has it all wrong.
Bullshit.
I never get anything wrong
There's no mistake about it
Let's just drink
- Cheers.
- Cheers
DAJEONG KOREAN RESTAURANT
You don't have a girlfriend?
- You're separated.
- l don't.
- No woman in your life?
- Can't find one
- No one you like?
- l have someone..
Someone I care about just as a person I feel peaceful this way.
Then why get separated?
Your wife is a good woman.
I forgot you met her
She is..
I assumed you had someone.
No.
I just..
Couldn't sleep at home.
Hard going home evey day
- How long has it been?
- A while.
- That's understandable.
- But he has someone
Who?
I thought you liked Boram.
That's nonsense You misunderstood.
She's just a friend
You mo aren't involved?
No
- Who is she?
- His friend from college
She's a professor.
Vey prem, too
Really?
- You're not sleeping with her?
- No, she's just a friend.
Don't go around saying that.
It's not good for her.
- l won't.
- You better not.
I care about her.
I insisted that we haye whiskey.
We came to a bar called 'Novel'
I ran into four people on the street today
A film producer, a director, a music director, and a student of mine.
They're all related to film lt all happened in menty minutes.
Then what?
Isn't that so strange?
It's just coincidence
Nothing happened, but it's still strange
- That is strange.
- Right?
Sure
Nothing happened directly to me but it's still mysterious nonetheless
Good point.
It happened to me too.
Ran into someone three times a day
You did?
I can't understand why it happened.
But it's vey strange I want to know the reason.
There is no reason
Random things happen for no reason in our lives
We choose a few and form a line ofthought.
- A line ofthought?
- Yes.
Made by all these dots, which we call a reason.
For example...
Say I accidentally pushed this cup off.
Why was my arm here right then?
Why did I move that way?
Countless coincidences operate behind this action.
But we're only concerned with the result.
We make my clumsiness the reason.
I am the reason, but I'm really not.
True.
Too many coincidences are behind it.
And more are behind those.
That's right
We can't help but make up judgments but many untraceable forces are at work in reality
That's probably why our actions are fallible and sometimes lead to disaster I'm talking too much.
Not at all.
You put a lot ofthought into it.
He's really grown!
Really?
Thanks, Jungwon I once thought that too.
Really?
I never heard it before It's so refreshing I really mean it.
You're smart I'm sory i stepped out.
You're back
We found what we needed
Something to eat, then?
A snack would be nice
- You've been out so long.
- l'm sory
This is Director Yoo.
Jungwon is an actor
- Nice to meet you.
- You too I apologize again.
- You should join us.
- Yes, I might.
We should drink.
I hoped the owner would come out.
Please come out.
How many coincidences brought me out here?
- l can think of a few.
- What are they?
The air, A man, A woman?
You're ridiculous I'm acting like a fool
Give me a cigarette.
It's fim cents
Can't I have it for free?
I'm joking.
It's yours
Tastes good.
- Good, isn't it?
- Yes.
- Jungwon seems amully quiet.
- You think so?
He's vey articulate Talks his way out of anything
Really?
- Better than you?
- l'm no good
You're vey articulate Better yet, you're smart.
You've thought your life through.
He's one ofthree big chatterboxes I know.
He is?
He's smart, but gets lost in his own words.
Smart, but unlucky.
I see
Believes himselftoo much but not other things.
Doesn't get along with others, but he's a good person I feel sory for him
Yes, well...
I guess you're right
What kind of person am I?
I don't read people that well.
Tell me what you think.
I'm intrigued.
You seem like a nice person I do?
I see
You seem like a nice person
Thank you
The _rst snow is falling I'm so lonely.
Wonder why I can't be with you.
Should I accept iR From Kyun\code(01f5)jin.
It's snowing.
Yes, it is.
I don't know anything about reading people.
But ifyou point out mo opposite extremes, they all believe it.
This is what I tell a woman.
"You look vey outgoing and cheerful on the outside,"
"but you cary pain and sadness inside you."
She replies, "How did you know?
"That's exactly how I am!"
Mentioning both extremes is the key.
We fall for it because of our opposing tendencies.
Then what kind of person am I?
Well...
I'm not good at reading people, but...
You seem vey practical and proper on the outside, but you're extremely emotional on the inside
Does that sound right?
That's how I am.
This is creepy!
That's really how I am.
It's so uncanny!
- Are you really like that?
- That's exactly how I am.
- It's so uncanny.
- l'm sure it is.
- Excuse me I'd like to play the piano
- Go ahead
That would be lovely
- But it's out oftune.
- That's all right
- But don't make fun.
- No one's making fun.
All right
- Can I watch?
- Sure.
I had no idea you could play the piano
You're playing with fire!
Don't get drunk!
I'm going to buy dumplings.
Dumplings are great.
- Are you going alone?
- Yes.
It's late. I'll come with you.
- Will you?
- Yes, I'll come along
- Thank you.
- Let's go.
Wait.
Something wrong?
- Isn't it cold?
- Yes.
Let's hury back
- How long are you in town?
- Three or four days.
- Let's go back inside.
- All right.
We should get back
Hang on What's your name?
- l'm Song Yejeon.
- Yejeon I see.
I'm Yoo Seongjun.
- Shall we go in now?
- Of course.
Hey!
I should take Boram home!
Okay!
Bye.
- Director Yoo.
- You again
- Drinking coffee outside?
- l guess so.
This is a close friend of mine.
Hello.
So you finally met him.
Hello.
We must be fate.
- We should do one together.
- You're right.
Do what?
I don't know why I keep running into you
No need to make up reasons for it
Just take in these marvels of life.
This is marvelous?
It's just strange to me.
I mean like the "marvels of creation"
not "marvelous"
- Like "what a marvel"?
- Right.
What are you doing?
Scouting locations with students.
- With who?
- They're over
Where did they go?
We've been looking for locations together.
They're so prepared these days.
Well, we should go.
Let's go.
No, this way.
- Talk to you soon.
- Okay.
- Who was that?
- Just some actress
- l keep running into her.
- l have someone like that.
- She's quite lovely.
- Is she?
We'll meet her again.
DAJEONG KOREAN RESTAURANT
So you dated someone "officially"?
- You're that curious?
- Yeah.
I'm not
She was exactly my ideal type ofwoman
What's your ideal type?
Someone who seems sharp and clever but is hopelessly good inside
She's full of emotions
She tries to hide it in, but she can't
So it bursts out sometimes
Someone you can sympathize for
This is so strange I think I'm like that.
I'm not kidding.
That's how I really am.
I think women are all similar.
Eveyone has mo extremes.
Ifyou point out both extremes, they usually agree
You know what I mean.
No, I don't get it.
But I really think I'm like that
Well, eveyone can be similar and different, too
- What are you saying?
- He means... lt all depends on what you're looking at.
- That's right.
- What are you saying?
Director Yoo.
So you're not going to make films anymore?
I don't have the strength for it these days
- You can't keep up?
- No.
It gives you will power and helps you think
Strength is important.
You look strong enough I'm the one who's worn-out
Why?
Are you tired?
- l drank a lot these days.
- Why?
- l'm just hurting a bit.
- What's wrong?
I have some sorrow in my heart I see
She was walking her dog and it got lost
She looked eveywhere.
How long did you raise it?
She really loved that dog
She put up missing posters and offered a big reward but she couldn't find it.
His name is Rookie.
I'm all that he has.
He must miss home so much.
He must want to come back to his warm house, and miss being held in my arms
He...
He...
He has no one else but me
He must be so sad and cold
Boram.
- Boram?
- Yeah.
Don't start cying again ls it that hard for you?
No, I'm okay.
No...
I'll be fine
- Thank you.
- Silly girl
Stop cying Stop!
Come on
But he must miss home so much.
I had a dog too so I understand
- Oh, you do?
- Yes, a little.
We went to a bar called 'NoveI' ror _oram
She's an emotional woman unlike what she seems.
This bar is so empty
Even the owner isn't here.
She'll be here soon.
Do you know her well?
- She's strange.
- How so?
Why is she out this long?
Isn't she afraid of people stealing things?
That makes sense.
She's had a surprisingly hard life
She's prem, but..
I don't think she's had a happy life.
She shouldn't be out so long
She sleeps here too?
If it gets late sometimes.
There's a room inside.
- There's a room?
- Yeah.
What's her stoy?
Bad luck with men.
The usual.
But I can't talk about it It's her privacy l bet she's met a lot of men
She did and she still does.
But I'm not sure I think she's seeing a few
Life gets boring alone.
Long nights with nothing to do
How many men?
She dates a few
The men aren't too serious about it.
Mostly well-mannered older men.
She's really prem, isn't she?
Yes, she is.
- More than me?
- No.
She can't compare
Why not?
You're completely different, because you're special to me
- What's special about me?
- You?
Well...
You're good.
You're vey talented.
You have many things others only dream of so just thank your parents
Stop drinking and complaining for no reason I look like I have lots to be thankful for?
You do
You're bursting with talent!
Just believe what I tell you!
Don't suspect it!
Stop doing that!
I really mean it!
Why are you yelling at me?
I understood you
But I'm lonely.
I'm just so sad I really am
I know I'm sory
I'll do better I will.
I'm sory for stepping out
You shouldn't be gone for so long!
I'm vey sory...
Would you like something to eat?
Yes, we're a bit hungy.
- All right.
- You know Director Yoo
Hello.
I apologize again
Why does she wander around this late?
Let's drink
Yes, cheers.
Boram was harsh on her.
She must be upset.
I'm going to the store to buy some food
You are?
I thought we had some leR... I apologize
Walk safe
I must be cursed.
I cut loose all the men for you and now I'm pure.
Don't push me away.
Can't we saye goodbyes for later?
From Kyun\code(01f5)jin.
I'm sory i think I was too drunk.
What do you mean?
I shouldn't have done that I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't remember a thing.
You don't?
No.
How long are you in Seoul?
I'm not sure right now.
I'll come back
Wait for me.
Wait at the bar I'll come right back
Back to the bar?
I have to go home.
Wait for me, okay
Wait for me.
Okay
You'll wait for me?
Yes, hone I'll wait.
Thanks.
Honey.
You'll come back to me?
I'll be back soon.
I'll send them off and come back
Okay, honey.
Let's get back.
They're waiting.
All right.
Director Yoo I'm going to keep my eye on you I'm going to watch how you change.
All right
- Are you okay?
- l'm fine.
I hope you accomplish what you mentioned.
I don't think I'm capable.
Then you shouldn't say that.
Let's go
- Let's go, Boram.
- Okay.
Let's go.
Honey.
is there a room here?
Yes, over here
- They all went home?
- Yeah, they did.
Can I go in?
Would you like to?
- But it's messy inside.
- That's all right.
- You look so tired, honey.
- l do?
- Why are you so nice to me?
- You're so good
- l didn't think we'd hit it off.
- Why not?
You're too manly
- You're a real man.
- No, I'm not.
You're so prem.
You were so charismatic when I first saw you I want you to be happy.
I mean it.
Thank you
Am I prem?
Yes I feel like I know you.
You're an angel on the inside.
I don't think you know me
You don't think so?
You think I'm better than I really am
There are many different sides of me I feel like I know who you are.
You're a good person, silly.
I don't express things well at first
But with you, I think that I can have the kind of love I've hoped for.
No one...
No one looks at me the way you do I mean it.
I don't think anyone ever has.
I love you I want you to be happy.
I want to make you happy.
Thank you
Stay inside.
It's cold I'll just see you go
Keep those three promises I will.
Just trust me on this.
Tell me what you promised me
First, meet lots of nice people
And you can't ever let them get away
What else?
Second, don't get drunk
What else?
The third thing was...
The third was...
You already forgot?
- A diay.
- That's right.
- Writing evey day.
- You have to.
- Even just three lines a day.
- l will.
I should go.
Can I have your number?
So I can text you when I miss youf I know, but...
You know we shouldn't meet again I know I don't even have your number I hope you believe me I know saying goodbye is best for us.
I believe you.
I have a nice memoy to cherish now
Thank you.
Have a happy life, honey.
I'm not sure you can stand saying goodbye
Yeah...
You have to be strong.
Trust me
And keep those promises.
It'll be good for me.
I promise to meet someone good I'll go now
Go before the cleaning lady comes.

Matthew, stop it.
Stop it, Matthe.
Matthew!
What?
The nails, stop biting your nails.
Look at this place.
Who lives here?
Who would want to live here?
It's nowhere.
Look, I know this can't be easy for you.
New school, new town.
New house and a big new daddy.
Hey, that's not fair, Matt.
Jacob is the best thing that's happened to me in forever.
So, I'm sorry that we had to pull you out of private school.
I had a scholarship!
Yes, I know, and it helped.
But we are maxed out.
Look, I need you to pitch in, okay?
That's the way it is and public school is part of it.
Mom, I had a life, I had friends.
Nobody I know has even heard of this school.
You're going to make new friends.
Mom, you have no idea what it's like to be the new kid.
I might as well have a kick me sign on my back.
Oh honey, you're being a little dramatic.
You're smart, you'll adapt.
Very few kids have been through what you've been through.
You're a fighter, huh?
And you're going to do just fine.
No, I'm going to hate this school and I know it.
See, honey?
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Want me to come in with you?
No, mom.
It's okay, I've got this.
Can I have a kiss goodbye?
No!
I'm not a baby anymore, mom!
Thanks for the ride.
Okay, well you have a great day, and you are still my baby.
Mom!
(P.A.):
Good morning students, welcome back to Aldergrove Secondary.
Schedules are now available in the office.
Please collect them and make your way to home room and classes will begin promptly in 10 minutes.
Have a great day, make this the start of a great year.
Because you're in high school now you can expect to do more homework without anyone reminding you and more reading.
Here's the reading list, it's long, and a breakdown of the assignments.
(Class):
Aww!
Alright, calm down.
It isn't going to be that bad.
But you won't be able to float through this course.
Hi.
Hello.
I'm Matthew Miller, I think I'm in this class.
Yeah, and I think you're late, Point Dexter.
Go to the office.
[laughter]
Mr. Worthlin, that is not how we treat new students.
You can work on your manners in detention.
Find a seat, Matthew.
Come on, I was kidding.
This guys my friend, we were just kidding around, right bro?
Yeah, we're friends.
It was a joke.
Yeah, see?
That doesn't make any difference to me.
I expect a certain standard of behaviour in my class.
Our first book of this year will be Metropolis which was made into a movie which remains an icon on film making.
This novel came first however, and it explores the themes of class struggle and genetic manipulation.
I want you to write a paper exploring these issues presented almost 100 years ago and how they've changed or not changed since then.
First day of school, I get detention.
What's up with that?
Hey, thanks for helping me out, man.
Yeah well, I didn't help much.
Yeah, well, still.
You tuned in real quick.
I'm Nick.
I'm Matthew.
So, what's it like to be the new kid?
It sucks.
Yeah, well, just make sure you report to the lunch room at 1:00 pm for the new kid beat down.
Wait, what?
Dude, I'm joking.
Lighten up man.
Real funny.
Oh, and Mateo, lose the suit man, you're just asking for it.
Thanks.
Hey.
Hey, how's it going?
Fine.
Yeah, well I'm really happy to see you getting your room together.
Can I use sticky tac?
Yeah, sure, yeah.
Whatever you want.
It's your room.
Just no open fires.
Here let me help you with that.
No, it's fine, I got it.
Okay.
He's cool, who's that?
My grandfather.
Really?
That's your mom's dad?
Yeah.
Your mom told me he was a car salesman.
He is, but before that he was a fighter and then a referee.
He does live in Florida though, right?
Yeah.
Huh.
I need to do some homework.
Now.
Yeah yeah, sure sure.
Alright, well, if you need any help
I'll be right out there.
Yeah.
[cheers]
Look at those pom poms.
See you at the sock hop.
What's up, Point Dexter?
Nothing.
Are you Matthew?
Hi, I'm Ruby.
You want to eat with us?
I'm okay.
Oh, come on, dude.
Eat with us.
We won't bite.
Well, I might.
Oh, Point Dexter tried to save me from detention in Mrs. Nasher's class yesterda.
How noble of him.
Yeah.
Sit down, dude.
Um, okay.
So, you want to join our crew?
What crew?
The Ghetto Crew.
We're the coolest non-club in school.
What's a non-club?
We're like the anti-club.
We're cooler than clubs.
Oh, so like an exclusive club.
You know it, and our goal is epic world domination.
Yeah, we're taking it back from all those jocks and stuck up losers.
Okay.
I like it, so what do I have to do?
Nothing.
That's the beauty of it.
Absolutely nothing.
Except, you got to go up to that girl Theresa, the tall one with the big smile, and ask her for a date.
What?
Don't do it, Point Dexter.
I'm not very, really...
This is important, he has to do it if he wants to get in the crew.
He can do it if he wants to get his face punched.
Yeah, I...
Are you going to do it or not?
Okay, you know what, sure.
I'll do it.
Perfect, show us your skills.
Yeah, okay.
Hi Theresa.
Did you say my name?
Yeah, hi, I'm Matthew, I'm the new kid here and I'm just kind of wondering if you ever wanted to maybe consider ever hanging out or going out or something sometime.
Whatever.
Okay, it was very nice to meet you Theresa.
This guy bugging you, Theresa?
No.
Were you checking out my girlfriend?
No, I was just -
What are you staring at your big ugly shoes for?
I'm talking to you, look at me!
I was just, I -
- I -
Is this kid stupid or something?
I'm sorry.
Oh I'm sorry.
Sorry didn't do it, you did.
Ahhh!
Hector!
What?
Are you crying?
No, I'm not crying!
Alright, this wimps going to get us in trouble.
Come on, let's eat.
Look, I'm watching you, loser.
[bell ringing]
Hey, you okay?
I'm fine, I'm not crying!
Yeah, sure.
Where's your next class?
It's Math, it's room 129.
That's right next to my room, I'll walk with you.
(Ruby):
Are you okay?
What happened?
[knocking]
How's it going?
It's fine.
You like books, huh?
Some of them.
Here.
I found that at a book store on my lunch break,
I thought you might like it.
Jacob, thank you!
This is, this is Muhammed Ali standing over Sonny Liston, it's what they call a phantom punch.
They say that Ali knocked him out with a punch nobody even saw.
Yeah, yeah.
My Dad told me about that fight.
That must have been something, huh?
Yeah.
[light knock]
Hey guys, I made a cake.
Chocolate.
Fight you for the last piece.
Yeah, yeah.
Come on!
I'll phantom punch you.
Stop right here.
Okay.
You don't need to pick me up after school because I think I'm going to walk home.
Have a good day.
Yup, thanks Mom.
Check out this guy right here, look at him.
Who said that you could use the front door, geek?
I just -
- I just --
I -
- I -
- What are you, Rain Man?
Speak up, punk?
Let me go!
Excuse me.
Is that your trash?
Is that yours?
No, it's this punks right here.
Hey, you wouldn't lie to me, would you?
It's not mine, so.
Really.
But you will clean it up, right?
Yes sir.
Thank you.
You boys can go to class.
What's the janitor going to do?
Mop me up?
Thanks.
Yeah, no need.
It's my job to clean up the trash around here.
So, you like boxing?
Yeah, I love it.
Do you box?
No.
What's so funny?
It's nothing.
They have a boxing club here you know, it's pretty cool.
You can practice, compete, and the whole bit.
Really?
Yeah.
Got to get back to work.
Look into it.
Okay!
[cheers]
Hector, come on!
He isn't worth it!
What do you want?
Nothing, I just think you're so cool.
Look, I don't want any trouble.
Trouble, what's this?
Give that back!
Matthew the Mighty, Matthew the Bull!
Dude, you are a trip.
Look, I want it back so just give it!
Hey, you need to relax.
Okay?
Alright?
Just relax.
Did you just try to bite me?
No!
Why don't you pick on someone else, Hector?
Oh look, this guy has new friends.
Yeah, I should have known you would hang out with this wimp.
Oh yeah, well it's better than hanging out with a meathead.
Watch your mouth!
Bird brain.
Hey, don't touch him!
You want to go?
You want to go?
We're going to get in trouble, stop!
Come on let's go, you and me, right now, right now.
let's do it!
[telephone ringing]
Hey, Nasty Nasher.
Hey Doyle, how was your summer?
Brief.
Okay.
Since nobody wants to tell me what happened you both have detention for a week.
What?
Does that include Hector and Theresa?
I'll be talking to them.
This is not a good way to start the year.
I hope it's the last time I see you in my office, do you understand?
Yes, ma'am.
Okay, you go to class, Matthew I want you to stay.
Nick, shut the door please.
Nicholas.
Mr. Doyle.
Look at me, Matthew.
Matthew.
Actions have consequences, Matthew.
Even though it's hard being the new kid you need to try and steer clear of trouble.
We didn't start anything, that guy Hector did, this detention is not fair!
Not everything is fair.
But in the future if you run into trouble call a teacher, don't try and figure it out on your own.
Now go to class, and think about what I said.
So, Matthew, is there something that you would like to tell us?
Yeah, yeah there is.
I am trying out for the boxing team at school.
They have a boxing club, huh?
You know how I feel about boxing.
It is a brutal and pointless sport that leads nowhere.
So, is there something else?
Okay, you know what, I'm not hungry.
Sit down, Matthew.
Your principal phoned me today and told me that you have detention for one week?
It's not my fault Mom, this guy was trying to bully me.
He started it and I got blamed.
That's all, I swear.
Well then stay away from him.
Did you get hurt?
No Mom, I didn't get hurt.
Look, I just need you to sign this permission form so I can try out for the team.
What has gotten into you?
What has gotten into me?
You moved me away from all my friends out here to nowheresville, that is what has gotten into me.
Hey, don't raise your voice to your mother like that.
Aw, thanks for your input, Dad!
Matthew, go to your room!
With pleasure!
[light knock]
Come in.
Matthew.
What?
I need you to try and make this work, okay?
I know that it is an adjustment but for me, please.
Mom, I am trying to adjust but you can't just expect it to happen like that.
Listen, Jacob and I have been talking.
So just tell me a little bit more about this boxing thing.
There's nothing really to tell,
I just need your permission.
But honey, you've never really boxed before.
Yeah, but I've always wanted to and there are plenty of fighters who started young.
Mike Tyson won the heavyweight title when he was 20.
That's only five years older than me and Wilfred Benitez, well he was world ranked when he was my age.
And Sugar Ray Leonard, he won before he was 20,
Grandpa won the middleweight
Okay, okay, Matthew, I get it.
We know what Grandpa won.
That is not the point.
Would you just sign it?
Boxing is so dangerous.
You know what could happen, you're not always a winner.
Yeah, but you're always telling me that I'm a fighter.
Yeah, I am, and you are.
When you were sick you amazed everybody.
And I want you to be happy, but I cannot stand the thought of you getting sucked into that world.
Mom...
Of you getting hurt!
It's too much for me to handle right now.
Okay?
I just want things to be normal.
It is no kind of life, Matthew.
Mom, you can't blame everything on boxing.
Okay, listen, listen.
Let's just get settled, make some friends, and then do something else.
Do anything else.
Okay.
I'll do my best.
I know you will.
Thank you.
I'm so relieved.
Mom, good night!
Jab, jab, jab!
Good.
Nice work.
Come on now, cover it up, you're giving him a big target.
That's it.
That's it.
Jab, jab.
Come on guys, let's switch it up a little bit.
Come on, come on.
Nice, get him on the ropes, get him on the ropes.
Good, good, good, good, good.
Cover up, cover up.
Jab, jab, jab, get him in the corner.
Get him in the corner, come on, that's it.
That's it, nice.
Jab, jab, jab, alright, time, good work you guys.
Good work.
[whistle]
Okay, boys bring it over here.
Gentlemen, welcome.
The boxing program at the Aldergrove Secondary School is second to none.
Each year we take a few spots at the national championships for the AIBA.
If you're lucky, one, maybe two of you are going to make this team.
Now, most of these spots are already filled but each weight division needs an alternate just in case the champion in that division can't compete.
So today I'm going to choose two contenders for each division.
Now come eight weeks time we're going to have the Aldergrove box-off where those two contenders are going to have a chance to challenge the current champion for that position.
What that means is that it's sink or swim guys, it's gutter time.
Each one of you will be sparring for 30 seconds with one of Aldergrove's top boxers.
Today, some of you will be boxing against Joe Fielder and some of you will be sparring against Hector Torres.
Last year Joe took the light heavy weight title for the 16 and under division and Hector won the State Championship for the middleweight division, all for Aldergrove.
Get in there and get warmed up you guys.
And the rest of you, I want you to line up and put your name and your weight down on this clipboard, let's go.
Hey, where are you going?
I just forgot I had something to do.
I thought you were going to try out.
I, I was but um, that guy Hector really annoys me so I'm just going to go.
Well, that's a good thing because you can use that feeling against him in the ring.
Yeah, well, he makes me really nervous.
So what, you don't think Joe Fraser was nervous when he fought Ali?
You think Fraser wasn't afraid of him?
What about Mustard Douglas?
You don't think he's afraid of Iron Mike?
They were, they were like--
No, no, there's no difference.
They were once a couple of nervous kids like you.
So, go on champ.
Go make them nervous.
Okay.
That's it.
Some guys are cheating here, come on guys, let's play fair out there.
Hey, new guy, get in there and impress me.
Nice, nice, nice.
Jab!
Come on, jab jab jab!
That's it, jab, jab.
Jab, jab, jab, good, good, good.
Get the combo on him, Joe, that's it.
That's it.
That's it.
Nice, nice, nice, new guy!
Well done!
Block him Joe, good good good!
Way to break out of there boy.
Take him to the corner, take him to the corner, come on!
That's it, that's it, put him down, put him down.
Good, good.
Okay, that's enough for you, buddy.
Step out.
Good.
Get him in the corner, Hector, get him in the corner, put him down.
That's it, that's it.
Good good.
Good, good, that's it, that's it, nice, nice.
Way to cover new guy, well done.
Nice.
Good, good, finish him off, finish hard, finish hard, time.
Nice work.
Nice work, good stuff.
Miller, Matthew Miller.
Matthew Miller!
Here!
Time to get in the ring, boy.
let's see what you got.
Okay new guy, 30 seconds to prove yourselves, keep your punches clean and above the belt, alright?
Hey coach, coach, let me tell you this, okay?
Okay you ready?
Hector, you ready?
Alright, let's box.
Alright, come on Hector!
Woah!
Keep it light, Hector.
Time!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
I said time!
Cheap shot me, I'll kill you!
Over there, Hector!
What's your problem, kid?
I call time, you stop punching.
Get out of my gym, go!
Shake it off, Hector.
You okay, champ?
I made a fool of myself.
Yeah, I saw that.
Yeah?
So then you saw me freak out.
Hey, but you were in there though.
It takes more guts than most people have just to get in the ring.
I didn't expect Hector to be so fast, he threw a lot of punches.
Well, he is fast.
But to your credit you took all those punches.
Yeah, to the face!
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Well, Hector and his goons have a lot to laugh about now.
I just wish I could go back to my old school.
You know, from what I saw
I just think you need to keep your form in check and learn to relax.
Yeah, like you know about boxing.
Hey kids, I had dreams of being a heavyweight champion of the world.
Really?
I was climbing up the ranks and everything.
To make a long story short, driving fast and showing off finally caught up with me and put an end to all that, so I know a thing or two about the fighting game.
Well, do you think I could be any good?
It's going to take a lot of practice.
Yeah, well, you're not going to see me in that ring any time soon.
Coach kicked me out.
Thanks anyway.
I'm Matthew.
Dan.
Hey, who's that kid with the glasses?
That's me back in the day.
You must have been really good to win that trophy.
Yeah, I was alright.
I'm sorry about what happened to you.
Don't be, I'm not.
I got married, my wife and I started having kids and I needed to earn a living so it all worked out.
You couldn't make money boxing?
Well, you don't get into boxing to make money.
You get into boxing to be the champ.
You know for every Oscar De La Hoya there are thousands of fighters who never make a dime.
You know, either because they don't have enough talent or they don't have the right management.
And in my case it was just a guy who was living way too fast.
So, aren't you mad?
Nah, not anymore.
You've got to learn to live with it.
Let me tell you something, I still love the sport.
Do you, do you think you could,
I don't know, teach me a boxing move?
Alright, I'll show you a jab, that's the most important punch.
Okay.
You come ready, don't you?
Alright.
If you're going to throw a jab you've got to have a stance first so let me see your stance.
Okay, now widen your feet a little bit.
Okay, a little bend in the knees.
Okay.
There you go.
See if I come in and try and push you
I don't want to be able to move you.
See, that's good balance.
If you're too narrow not good.
Okay the jabs the left hand, let me see that jab.
Okay, not bad just throw it straighter, right down the pipe.
There you go.
See this jab is going to keep the other fighter from getting his rhythm, okay?
Okay.
You can use this jab to find your range, okay.
You always want to keep your hands up high, you don't want to drop them down here.
Yeah, yeah, like Tommy Hearns.
Yeah, yeah, but just remember you're not Tommy Hearns.
Okay.
Throw that jab.
Okay.
There you go, straight down the pipe.
There you go, come on, throw that jab.
[bell ringing]
Alright, lessons over.
Hey, do you think I could maybe come back here after school and you could show me some more stuff then?
Yeah, sure.
Maybe you could even train me.
Well, I don't know about that.
Come on, please Dan, we could just do it in here.
I just want to learn how to box so bad.
Well, let's just put a hold on that for now.
Okay, but I'm going to come right back here after sixth period.
Fine.
Thanks Dan.
Jab.
Jab.
1, 2.
1, 2.
1, 2.
Stop.
Will you do me a favour, take the glasses off, see if you can do it without them.
Okay.
Jab.
Jab.
1, 2.
1, 2.
Right hand.
There you go.
Starting to see some natural abilities in there.
Looking good.
My grandfather was a boxer, Charlie Putnam.
Yeah, I knew Charlie.
He was refereeing last time I saw him, good guy.
Jab.
1, 2.
There you go, 1, 2.
1, 2.
Alright.
Uh huh.
See, now if I start throwing punches at you you're right to cover up but you've got to keep your eyes open and look for openings, okay?
Anticipate.
Jab.
1, 2.
Jab.
1, 2.
Alright, you done any running?
I run away a lot.
[chuckles]
I will start running to and from school.
Alright, that's good, but you need to add in some roadwork.
I guess.
Do we really have to do eight laps?
Well you do.
I'm going to stop here pretty soon.
Maybe I will too.
Hey, if you're going to be a champ you've got to train like a champ.
Oh, and if you can you've got to hold your hands up when you run.
When I used to do my road work
I threw punches when I ran.
That's good practice, it's going to help you build up your endurance before a fight.
Okay, I think we should stop soon.
I'm getting kind of dizzy.
Yeah.
Well, we almost did four laps.
Yeah, I guess a miles good for the first day.
So, did you know I'm a nerd?
Well, the socks kind of gave it away.
Yeah, my Mom has this idea that I'm going to be a lawyer or a doctor or some kind of guy that wears a suit.
Can't blame her for that.
Sounds like every Mom.
Yeah, boxing's not really on her list.
She thinks I'm going to get hurt or become irresponsible.
And I was really sick as a baby so.
Like serious sick?
Like, leukemia.
But it's okay because I'm good now, so it's okay.
I don't know.
Maybe you ought listen to her.
But if Evander Holyfield cae back and beat Mike Tyson after a heart problem and Wayne McCullough has a cyst in his head, he still fights.
Yeah, but kid.
You've got a lot more options than they had.
I guess, I don't know.
You know in boxing there's a lot more going on than the opponent standing in front of you, and there are a lot of elements that go into winning a fight.
Now I think training is important but your mindset, now that's the real key.
It takes a lot of concentration.
Now you've got to block out things inside that ring that don't have anything to do with your opponent.
Yeah, it's like when I'm doing trigonometry.
Well, there's a difference between a Math problem and a fight.
Say you're in a fight, okay, now you're dead tired.
Now your body aches.
Now you've got a cut, you've got blood dripping in your eyes.
But you've got to block all of that out and still win the fight.
So, are you going to train me?
Yes.
But it's our secret.
It's going to be one hour a day, Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
Now on the off days you run this track.
Okay.
Eight laps.
Okay.
And don't neglect your studies.
I won't, this school is so easy.
You're going to train me.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Whooo!
Yes, you're going to train me!
Thank you, Dan!
Yes!
Okay, what about this one?
No.
Mom, you said to get whatever I wanted.
Yeah, but you don't have to go along with the crowd.
Fine.
Okay, this, this is the last one.
Oh.
I like that one, that one is good.
Yeah, yeah, okay.
But no jeans that hang low on the bum okay,
I hate those.
So, these are returns, agreed?
Yeah, fine.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hey look at this, I barely even recognized him,
I thought he was Lennox Lewis.
Look at those boxing gloves.
Yeah dude, the freaking janitor,
Dan the muscle man is training him.
How do you know?
I saw them running the track the other day.
My God, that is too funny.
Hey look, I'm Matthew.
Ow, ow, it hurts, boxing, ow.
What a freaking loser.
Where are your glasses?
I only really need them for distance.
So, I should stay close then?
Yeah, that would be good.
So, you want to go to the mall?
Yeah, I do but I can't, I've got to be somewhere.
Yeah?
Where?
A secret meeting?
Another life?
Not exactly.
I've got to go for a run.
That's cool, but I hate running.
Yeah well, I'm in training right now with a trainer.
That's cool in a Karate Kid kind of way.
Yeah, yeah, it's awesome.
I mean, it's all about self-discipline.
It's not about starting fights, it's about defending yourself.
Too bad Hector doesn't know that,
I mean the guy is such an idiot.
Yeah, you don't have to tell me.
You know, you're not like any girl I've ever met.
Woah, where did that come from?
I don't know.
You're always acting tough and you hang out with guys, not girls.
Yeah well, I'm not really like most girls,
I'm not exactly the Miley Cyrus type.
Yeah, you're always drawing in that book.
Yeah.
Can I see some of your stuff?
Um, these are just scribbles, I mean.
I won't tell anyone.
Okay, well only if you promise not to laugh.
I don't think I could handle that kind of rejection.
I won't, I swear I won't.
Oh wow.
What do you think?
Ruby, these are, these are really good, not like comic book good but I mean like.
Seriously?
Yeah, you remind me a lot like this artist, Klee.
Who's that?
Paul Klee, he started drawing with like chalk on the sidewalk, you know, graffiti kind of stuff.
But he did some crazy caricatures and I mean, like, you'd love him.
You know, I drew a picture of you.
Really?
Sure, I didn't have anything better to do.
Wow.
That, now that is art.
It's nice, it's very perceptive.
You know, it's so weird, you're such a...
What, a nerd?
A softy.
I can't believe you want to box.
Yeah, well, it's, um, it's in my blood.
Hey!
Time!
Nice, that's good enough for today.
Yeah.
You know, for someone who's never boxed before you catch on pretty quick.
Must be genetics.
Dan, no, I'm in the zone, I can tell,
I'm going to be good at this.
That's good kid, setting goals is good, it leads to progress.
Speaking of progress I've got to get to work.
Or I'll never get out of here tonight.
Do you want me to give you a hand?
I feel like I owe you.
No, no, no.
It does me good to put the pads on anyway.
Besides I'm sure you've got better things to do than clean up the girls washroom.
Yeah, maybe.
You know, I'm going to call a friend of mine that has a gym, see if we can get you some real sparring time.
Really?
Yeah.
Hey Dan, do you mind if I maybe take these gloves home?
Because I want to practice but the only ones I have are the ones Grandpa gave me when I was 10 and they're like completely worn out.
Yeah, yeah, sure, you've just got to keep this on the down low.
I mean tell your folks and all but you've got to keep this between you and me.
Okay, I understand.
Hey loser.
Come on, Hector.
Leave him alone!
You're going to get me kicked off the cheerleading squad!
Hey loser, are you deaf or something?
That was a pretty good hit you got me with.
Yeah, it was, but it was also a mistake and it cost me a spot on the team so you should be thrilled.
Thrilled?
No, no, see that's why I wanted to talk to you.
See, I told the coach that he should give you another chance.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, I said you hit really hard so he said to find you and tell you to come to the gym today after school because he's giving you and a couple other guys one more shot.
You see, he's not totally satisfied with the roster.
Really?
Yeah.
Is it just today because there's somewhere
I usually go after school?
Sorry, it's only today, man.
Okay, I guess I'll see you there.
Alright, see you there.
Is there really a special tryout?
Oh yeah, it's very special.
Hey, where's Coach Harwood?
He'll be here in a bit.
Yeah.
He just told us to start sparring first so why don't you put these on.
I was just going to use my gloves.
Oh, these are better.
Okay.
What about headgear?
I don't have any.
I've got some for you.
Here.
Um, who's going to keep time?
I will.
Okay.
Ding ding ding!
Here we go Hector!
So Matthew, why do you hang out with those losers?
They're not losers, they're my friends.
Hey, this guy can really hit.
Maybe he should be on the team.
Hey, ow!
I thought we were just sparring?
Yeah, that's over now, loser.
Ow!
You almost got us in trouble the other day so now you get this.
Ow!
What are you even doing here?
You don't belong at this school, you belong at a school for nerds.
Stop it!
Hey, Hector.
Shut up, this pansy needs to learn his lesson.
You want to box?
Come on.
You want to box?
Come on!
Hey, what are you guys doing?
!
Nothing, we were just sparring.
It looked like more than sparring to me.
What are you going to do about it anyway?
You're just the janitor so why don't you come in here and mop it up.
What are you going to do about it?
You're right punk, I am the janitor.
You're lucky I don't mop the floor up with you.
Are you threatening me?
It's not a threat, it's a fact.
Now get out of here.
What's going on here?
You tell me.
This kids not part of my program and neither are you.
You better talk to your boy Hector.
I will, get over here Hector.
You stay out of this, Dan.
You okay, kid?
No, I need to lie down.
Come on, let's get you up.
I can't.
I can't get up.
Come on, I'll give you a ride home.
Here, look up.
Matthew?
Matthew?
[light knock]
Hey, what happened, baby?
Nothing Mom, everything is fine, just leave me alone right now please.
Is that guy still bothering you?
Mom, stay out of it.
I'm going to call the school.
No, Mom, don't do that.
Look at me, Matthew.
Matthew, look at me.
Oh no, this is unacceptable, I am telling the principal.
Mom, it's just a bruise, if you jump in it's not going to make anything better it's going to make everything worse.
I can try to deal with this on my own.
No, I think you've had enough trying it on your own.
I agree with Matthew, I think maybe you and I should hold off before we get involved.
But, look!
He's not a kid, he's a young man.
A lot of people were there, even a teacher saw it okay.
Now I can do this, so just let me.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll go make some pizza, from scratch.
[loud sanding noise]
Hey Dan!
What do you want?
Mind if I come in?
[loud sanding noise]
Free country.
[loud sanding noise]
Hey Dan, I've got to talk to you.
So talk.
Can you turn that thing off?
Yeah, I'm just finishing up.
You know that kid had no right being in a boxing ring.
Yeah, and your kid had no business doing what he did.
I already spoke to him, he's going to apologize personally and he promises to stay away from your kid.
The kid's name is Matthew.
Swell, he promises to stay away from Matthew.
So, that's it?
Hector beats up a kid for no reason and you just talk to him, he should be suspended.
Quite frankly he should be arrested.
Dan.
You know I'm right, but you're not going to let anything happen to him.
Bottom line is Hector Torres is the best fighter this school, this town, has ever had.
He's fighting the toughest league in the state and no one can compete with him, the kid's going to the amateurs.
Oh then he's going to the pros, maybe the Olympics first.
And if you're lucky you'll be there to carry his spit bucket.
It's a heck of a lot better than cleaning up after him.
I know what you're doing.
I'm doing it too, alright.
We see ourselves in these kids and we push them to be great, the only difference is my kid's got it and your's doesn't.
And if you don't put an end to it he's going to wind up just like you, hurt and defeated.
You know, you may be right about me.
Because when you and I were coming up
I did everything the wrong way.
And I put my ego in front of the sport.
But this kid has something that you and I and Hector don't have.
This kids got heart.
[laughs] Heart.
Come on Dan.
Look at you, you're out with an injury, me, well let's just say I'm better off behind the ropes.
But Hector's got what it takes to go the distance.
Yeah, well I'm willing to bet you wrong about Matthew.
[laugh]
I'll make you a deal.
What kind of deal?
Let Matthew fight in the box-off, just give him a fair shot.
Let him fight Hector inside the ropes with a ref.
Are you crazy?
I'll train him and take full responsibility.
Or I'd be happy to talk to the principal about what happened yesterday.
Maybe he'd like to see Matthew's shiner, maybe he'd like to talk to a few of the witnesses.
You're serious?
Yeah, I'm dead serious.
The kids got no style, he can't compete, he's going to get hurt out there.
I believe in him.
Alright, alright, fine.
But you get the parents to sign off on this.
No problem.
Hey Champ, what's up?
Nothing.
Yeah, I was looking for you.
Are you coming by the shop?
Maybe not today.
Missing a day, huh?
That's no way to train, Matthew.
I know, it's just, I just...
Just what?
Hey kid, you hit the mat.
Every champion hits the mat sooner or later, the question is are you going to get back up?
I just don't know if I have what it takes.
You know who Cus D'Amato was?
Yeah sure, he trained Mike Tyson.
So then you know the story about the hero and the coward.
Sort of.
The hero is the hero because he's not afraid and the coward is the coward because he is.
Something like that, but it's not just about being scared.
It's what you do when you feel that way, how you react to your fear, that's what makes you the hero or the coward.
So, what am I?
You tell me.
I'm not going to lie to you, Matthew.
There's no guarantees.
Every fight is different, but it's you who determines who you are.
A misfit.
We're all misfits.
But the only person who can stop you from doing something is you.
So, are we going to train or not?
You got a fight coming up.
Wait, what?
I do?
Coach Howard agreed to let you back in the box-offs.
Woah, woah, Dan, how does that work?
Every contender fights Hector Torres.
You are a contender.
Dan, he's going to kill me!
Yeah, maybe, but if you win you're on the team.
Yeah, and if I lose?
You did your best and that's good enough now pick up your books.
That's it!
That's it!
Work, work!
Try to buy time.
Good job.
You're definitely getting faster, Matthew.
Yeah, I've been running like you told me to.
Well good, because against Hector you're going to need to throw punches for three minutes of every round, okay?
You show him you're not afraid, that's going to change everything.
I don't know, Dan.
Do you really think that I've got a shot here?
Kid, this is boxing.
Anything can happen.
I talked to my buddy Avery, he said we could use the gym.
So I'll set you up a sparring session.
Yeah?
Yeah, but before that happens you're going to have to get these release forms signed by your parents.
Otherwise you can't compete and I can't take you off campus.
Do you want me to talk to them?
No, no, it's okay.
I've got this.
Okay, good job.
Thanks Dan.
Okay, honey.
We're leaving now.
Okay.
Back around 11.
Yeah sure, have a good night.
See ya.
Bye.
[birds cawing]
Alright, you know what a fighter's greatest asset is?
Power.
No.
What, speed?
No, those two things are important but most of all, and this is what helped Foreman win the title at 40.
45.
45.
What helped him win the title at 45 was just being relaxed in the ring.
The key to being relaxed in the ring is not getting psyched out by what your opponent is trying to do.
Don't worry about him, just fight your fight.
Stick to your game plan.
Okay.
Use that jab and find your range, okay?
Uh huh.
Step in.
Alright, you guys keep it light.
Ready, let's box!
Come on Matthew, punch.
Time!
Kid, who's your favourite defensive fighter?
Marlon Starling was supposedly pretty good.
Well, as good as he was he still threw a punch from time to time.
So, throw more punches?
Please, keep your hands up, just like we talked about at school.
Ready?
Hands up.
Alright, let's box!
Go to the body, Matthew,
Don't look at me!
You gotta do something, Matthew!
You're not going to have any help in there with Hector.
Do something!
Come on Matthew!
Yes!
That a way.
Time!
Yes!
Yes, sir.
Good job.
How do you feel?
I feel good.
You rocked it.
You really rocked it.
Jab!
Jab!
Jab right hand!
Jab right hand!
And the champion of Aldergrove Secondary School is Matthew Miller!
1, 2.
Time.
Looking good, Matthew.
Looking real good.
As good as Hector?
Don't you worry about Hector.
I have to, he's the school champion.
So what?
Sometimes the champion isn't as interesting as the challenger.
I guess.
See that picture there in the middle?
Yeah.
That's me and Coach Howard.
The boxing coach at school?
Yeah.
It's the day we fought the Golden Gloves when we were your age.
Did you win?
Well, I'm not the one holding the trophy but I thought I won.
A lot of people thought I won.
Sometimes the judges seems like they see a different fight.
Yeah, that's like when James Toney fought Dave Taberi.
I'm not sure I remember that one.
Well, supposedly Taberi won the fight but the judges gave Toney the decision.
Now that fight was in 1992 before I was born and Taberi never fought again.
Can't win them all, that's why you've got to love the sport and not the glory.
Yeah.
Need a ride home?
No, I'm just going to bike it home.
[train sounds]
Are we looking for a house?
You know, you guys can just let me out and I can find it myself.
You don't need to waste your time.
No, I want to know where you're going, we'll pick you up.
Okay.
She said it's number 1042.
Are her parents going to be home?
Probably.
There!
That's it!
Kind of an odd neighbourhood.
She lives here?
Well, maybe her parents work from home.
That's not all that uncommon.
Is that Ruby?
Yup, that's great.
Thanks Jacob.
Bye Mom.
I just want to get out.
No, please don't.
Just pick me up at 11, okay.
Thank you.
Matthew!
Hi.
Are those your parents?
Yeah, something like that.
Come on.
This is so cool.
I wonder how they did that, make movies like this back then.
It took forever,
I mean no one had ever seen anything like this.
Do your parents have a lot of movies?
Yeah.
Hundreds.
Thousands.
Wow, that's really cool.
What do your parents do?
Well, I don't really have a Dad and we lived with my Grandfather.
My Mom is a florist, she had her own shop and everything.
Cool.
She is so pretty.
Well, don't you think she's pretty?
Yeah, you are too.
Shut up!
Do you really think so?
Yeah.
Of course.
You're sweet.
Yo, Adrian!
We did it!
Yo!
Stop it, you're embarrassing me.
I'm sorry, just that was awesome.
Sit down.
[laughs]
Never been here with anyone before,
I mean I'm usually with my parents.
Yeah well, it's really cool just watching movies here like this, with you.
In our own private drive in and I think I'm going to kiss you again.
Has anyone ever told you just to be quiet?
Well, do you think I'm weird because I talk so much?
No, I think you're weird because you're weird.
Yes!
I mean, I think we should just kind of hang out.
More of the same.
Hey, loser!
Look, it's the loser and his loser girlfriend, the perfect couple.
Come on, Ruby.
You know what, leave us alone you meathead jock!
meathead jock.
Didn't Matthew tell you, he's a meathead jock now, we're going to be fighting.
And if he wins which is impossible he's going to be on the team.
Oh, he's going to win.
He's going to kick your butt in front of everybody.
Ruby.
You better tell your girl to watch her mouth or she might get you in trouble.
You know what, back off Hector.
What are you going to do if I don't?
Ahhh!
Don't even think about telling coach about this, okay, because you threw the first punch.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I hope you destroy that guy.
Yeah, me too.
[bell ringing]
So, Ruby said that you went over to her place on Saturday?
Actually, we watched that movie from English class at her parents drive in.
You should have called me, I have to watch that movie.
I mean, Mrs. Nasher's making me rewrite my paper because she doesn't think I read it.
Yeah, because you didn't.
I don't know, just go rent it or something.
So, what's going on between you two?
Normal stuff.
What's that mean?
Normal stuff?
Whatever guys and girls do that's normal.
Like kissing?
Yeah, that's normal, right?
Really?
Did you guys like french kiss or--?
Hey guys, what's up?
Hey, we were just talking about kissing you.
Nick!
What?
What did you tell him?
Don't be mad, it was just--
He told me you kissed.
Well, it's none of your pea-brained business!
What else did you say?
Nothing, he asked and I--
Come on, Ruby.
You guys are such losers.
Ruby, wait!
Nick!
Matthew, Matthew, wait, she's just PMSing.
No, she's mad.
No, now is not the time.
Trust me, your life is at risk.
Boring.
But is it Math?
Is it Math?
Looking good.
Looking good.
What is this?
[bell ringing]
Okay kids please, h thank you thank yo, that is wonderfu.
You just made my day.
Matthew, can I have a word with you?
Yeah, sure.
You having trouble with the assignments?
No, not really.
Really?
I only ask because you haven't turned in two so far this semester, you missed another one this week.
I'm so so sorry Mr. Doyle,
I'll make up the assignments I promise.
Okay, good.
Because you know, I'm here to help you.
Homework is important, it's worth half your grade.
I know, I just forgot.
Alright, so when are you going to have the assignments in by?
I don't know, soon I guess.
You guess?
It better be soon or I'm going to have to call your parents,
I only let students miss two assignments per semester, you're over the limit.
If you don't get good grades you can't sign up for any clubs or teams.
Wait, what if I just did them right now?
Right now?
Yeah, I've got a spare.
I can stay and we can do them right here, if you don't mind.
Sure, right now.
You're just going to do three assignments right now, in your spare.
Just right now.
Sure.
I can do it.
Of course, good idea.
Let's just do three assignments right now, there you go.
3, 2, 6, and 7, is 39...
I was laughing my head off.
Anyway, it wasn't until after that I realized
I had ketchup all over my --
I had ketchup all over my face.
It was like the most embarrassing thing ever.
Hey Dan!
Dan?
Mr. Barns?
Hey Mom.
Matthew.
Jacob, what are you doing home?
Why don't you come in the living room and talk with your mother and me.
What's going on?
Sit down.
Am I in trouble?
Yes.
Is this about my homework or my--
Is it true that you have been boxing at school and that the janitor has been coaching you?
His name is Dan and yeah I've been getting a few pointers.
But we agreed that you would not box!
Your mother was pretty clear how she felt about that.
Okay, why are you even here?
You're not my father.
Matthew, please!
Maybe, it's because my name is on the release form your principal brought with her today.
Apparently Coach Howard has agreed to let Matthew participate in the box-off.
Dan, Mr. Barns, was adamant that he had made it clear to Matthew that he needed to have one of you sign the permission form.
He understood that you had turned it into the office.
I'm very sorry about this, with upwards of 700 students we just can't know what they're doing all the time.
We expect our staff to be diligent and we had to let Dan go.
What?
How long has this been going on, Matthew?
This is not Dan's fault, this was my fault, he was just doing me a favour, he was standing up for me.
If he's not there then I quit.
I quit school, I don't care because this is wrong.
Be quiet, Matthew!
No, I will not be quiet!
What has gotten into you?
Mom, I need to do this because I am good at it and I need to be good at something,
I have put so much time and effort--
Yes!
And you lied to us!
Christine!
Hey, Matthew!
Alright, let's all just sit down and listen for a moment.
Mom, nobody thinks that I can make this team but I think I have a shot and Dan thinks I have a shot.
He's given me a chance to do something here, he's like my only friend, he's someone who actually believes in me!
Hey, I am somebody who actually believes in you.
Your mother is somebody who actually believes in you.
No she's not, she always thinks I'm going to fail or I'm going to get hurt or--
Well, we've been talking here and your mother and I have both agreed to let you fight in the box-offs.
With Dan's help!
No, absolutely not.
But he's my trainer!
Lower your voice, Matthew.
He shouldn't have been your trainer, that's the point.
He was fired because that's not his job and he shouldn't be interfering with students or their activities.
He did his job!
He didn't do anything wrong!
He knows more about boxing than that stupid coach at school.
I'm done.
Okay, I am leaving because this is wrong!
This is so wrong!
Matthew!
That'll get you there.
Thank you.
Alright.
[birds cawing]
Mr. Barns!
Hey, Matthew.
Sorry things turned out this way.
I'm sorry that I lied about getting my parents permission.
So am I kid.
I can't go back to that school if you're not there.
Don't get carried away kid, life goes on.
I'm sorry that you lost your job,
I wasn't trying to get you in trouble.
I agreed to be your trainer Matthew but you had to tell your parents.
That was our deal.
You broke the bond between trainer and fighter.
I know.
I know.
Relax kid, if anybody should be crying it oughta be me.
I'm the one that got fired, not you.
So, why aren't you?
You think I wanted to be a janitor the rest of my life?
Kid, I had dreams just like everybody else.
Lately they haven't seemed to go my way.
The question is what are you going to do?
About what?
Well, you've got a fight coming up.
Dan, I can't do it without you!
Well then what the heck are you doing this for, kid?
It hasn't been for me.
But you're not even going to be there!
Listen, kid.
You're alone anyway.
I'm not in the ring with you,
I don't have a pair of gloves on,
I'm just there in the corner to guide you along.
You know for three minutes of every round it's just you and your opponent.
Nothing else matters.
For three minutes of every round you get to show everybody exactly what Matthew Miller is made of.
I'm scared, Dan.
Hector wants you to feel scared, son.
He's expecting you not to fight.
But you show up win or lose as long as you get in that ring and do your best, you fight that fear, you win no matter what.
You think I can beat Hector?
It doesn't matter what I think, it matters what you think.
Now get out of here.
[alarm buzzer]
Morning.
Morning.
Oh, you should have come down quicker, it's probably all mushy by now.
Mom, it's fine.
I don't know if I can do this honey.
I mean I went once when I was a little girl to watch Dad and I,
I threw up, I just threw up when I saw Dad getting hit and all the blood and oh dear.
We don't have to go Christine.
Mom, it's fine.
Whatever you decide, it's okay.
Now, I'm going to go run a couple laps before first period.
Okay, I love you.
Bye, bye Jacob.
Love you.
Okay.
Hey Matthew.
Hey.
It's the big day.
Should we reserve a hospital bed for you?
Shut up, Nick.
Come on, I'm just joking.
You know, ease up the tension.
I hate boxing, I mean I hate sports, but I'm coming to watch you so if you win--
When he wins.
When you win just don't become a dumb jock, okay?
Come on, I won't!
Okay, well see you two.
Hey.
Hey.
How you been?
I've missed you.
I've missed you too okay, I'm sorry that I blabbed.
Hey, I totally overreacted.
I drew you.
You winning the boxing match.
Wow.
Ruby, that's just how I imagined it.
I'm not quite done though.
I think I'm going to add Hector somewhere in there, maybe on the floor, knocked out.
You know, I think I like it the way it is.
Just me.
Well, Mr. Confident.
I should probably be getting to class, but I'll see you later.
Oh yeah.
And, Matthew?
Yeah?
Good luck in the ring.
Look who showed up.
So, who's working your corner, Matthew?
He's so scared.
He can't talk.
Is that true?
Are you so scared you can't even speak?
No Hector.
I'm just too busy thinking about how stupid you sound when you open your mouth.
Oh-ho-ho.
And Joe, you smell like a dumpster, when was the last time you showered?
Now is your chance to laugh it up dork, because once we get in the ring one things for sure.
You're going to die.
Nice comeback, champ.
Dan!
How you doing, kid?
I'm good.
I'm nervous.
You should be nervous.
Five minutes, boys.
I just came to wish you good luck.
Thanks.
I just want you to block everything out and do what you've been taught to do.
I'll do my best.
Just remember, Hectors just as nervous as you are.
See you out there.

Let's box!
[crowd cheering] [ding] [crowd cheering]
Hey, long time no see.

Your husband called me, I appreciate it sir.
Well, I knew he was going to be pleased, this is a huge day for him.
Glad to be here.
[crowd cheering]
Hit him on the inside.
Follow it up!
[ding, ding]
Good job.

And now in our ligt heavyweight class please welcome our State champion in the 1600 divisio,
Joe Fielde.
Come on Joe!
Come over here guys, come on.
I know you both know the rules, alright.
I want a clean fight, you got three rounds to make this team?
Any questions?
Alright, let's touch gloves, have a good fight.
Fight!
[ding] [crowd cheering]
Come on Joe, you've got to hit him one time!
[crowd cheering]
Yes!
Yes!
What?
[crowd cheering] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... (Dan's voice):
Everybody's afraid, Matthew, but how you react to that fear is what makes you the hero or the coward.
...9 [crowd cheering]
Hey, you ready?
You ready?
Yeah, yes!
Let's see what you got.
Okay.
Come on, Matt!
Go Matthew!
Come on, Matthew!
You can do it, come on!
(Dan's voice):
You don't think Joe Fraser was nervous before he fought Ali?
Now, in the middleweight division our final contender and challenger, Matthew Miller!
And defending in this division, our state champion, Hector Torres.
[crowd cheering]
Come over here, Hector.
Come on Hector, just do it!
[crowd cheering]
Hey Miller!
(Dan's voice):
You fight that fear and you'll win, no matter what.
Snap out of it!
Alright, remember, you've got three rounds, three minutes each.
No low blows, no rabbit punches, in case of a knock down
I want you to go to the neutral corner.
Alright.
If that ref says break,
I want you to break clean, any questions?
No one's in your corner, pansy.
Hey, take it easy Hector.
Whatever you say, coach.
Let's have a good fight!
[crowd cheering]
Ready?
Ready?
[ding]
Fight!
(Dan's voice):
Hector wants you to be afraid, Matthew, he wants you to give up.
Hands up, Matthew, hands up!
Good job, Hector!
Oh my God.
I can't!
Okay, step back, come on, fight.
(Dan's voice):
Don't worry about what Hector's doing, just fight your fight.
Nice!
Jab, Matthew, jab!
[ding ding]
Alright, over to the corner.
Keep it clean.
There's no one looking after that boy.
Start playing by the rules buddy, look at me when I'm talking to you!
How am I supposed to back you up if you're not playing by the rules, huh?
Don't blow this for yourself!
Here.
Now, sit sit sit.
Grandpa?
Here's some water, reach out your mouth.
What are you doing here?
Your new father called me, don't worry, it's all good.
Yeah.
Is Mom okay?
Just concentrate on the match.
You don't think about anything else.
That last round was good, but you've got to throw some more punches.
Yeah, I know, I'm counting.
Counting what?
Well, he throws six punches and then he breaks and that's when I've got to hit him.
That's a good observation.
But you've got to keep your hands up but don't lose sight of him, don't hide.
Come out with your hands nice and loose.
The last round you've got him good.
He got me, is there a lot of blood?
Nah, it's not much.
He fights like a baby.
Come on.
[ding] [crowd cheering]
Go Matthew!
Take control!
(Dan's voice):
If you're going to win this fight you have to block everything out.
Over there, over there!
[crowd cheering]
Come on!
Come on, Matthew!
[crowd cheering]
(Dan's voice):
Keep your chin down, Matthew, eyes up.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[ding] [crowd cheering]
Yeah, that's right!
It's all me!
How you doing, son?
You had enough?
No.
He popped you good there, getting through those gloves.
There you go, cool you down.
Kid, how are you?
Dan!
You're doing great, keep working the body though, okay?
You find those ribs and you keep working those ribs, you pound him.
Three minutes to go in this fight.
Okay, you hear me?
The guy behind me he's getting sloppy and he's getting tired.
You see that, he's getting sloppy and tired.
Okay, this is your round, this is your round.
Okay?
Give me everything you got.
I will, I promise!
All in the ring.
I promise!
Oh, he's a baby.
After him.
[ding]
Come on, Matthew!
Come on!
Concentrate, Matthew.
Come on, Matthew!
You can do it, come on!
(Dan's voice):
Stay in the moment, Matthew.
Nothing else matters.
[loud cheers] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...
Yeah buddy, yeah!
Alright, let me see your gloves.
Fight.
Come on, Matthew!
Come on Matthew, come on!
(Dan's voice):
This is your chance, Matthew, show the world exactly what you're made of.
[ding, ding] [loud cheers] [loud cheers]
Whooo!
Go Matthew!
Get over there and do the right thing, son.
Go on.
Hey, that was a good match, you hit pretty hard.
Yeah, you too.
So, after three great rounds of action the judges tally is in.
And the score is 2 rounds to 1, for the current middleweight champion of Aldergrove Secondary School, Hector Torres!
[loud cheers]
I think he did alright.
Yeah.
It's alright, Matt!
Way to go!
What?
I lost.
But you lasted three rounds kid, you showed the heart of a champion.
You're a winner to me all the way, son.
But I lost.
Yeah, that's how you do it!
I'm taking Aldergrove Secondary to the top, we're going to be the best in the whole league!
Yeah!
Let's go!
[loud cheers]
I just want you all to know what a great discovery
I think Matthew Miller is, and I definitely think there's room for him as an alternate in the middleweight division for the Aldergrove Boxing Team, what do you say?
[loud cheers]
After all, Hector graduates this year and we're going to need someone to win some championships for Aldergrove, how about that?
I want to be on the team, I want to be on the team.
Come on up here and say a couple words.
Thank you coach.
Well, I just wanted to thank my parents for always telling me that I'm a fighter.
My best friends Nick and Ruby for never letting me fight alone.
My grandpa for being in my corner and finally my coach, Dan Barns for telling me that I could be a champ.
[cheers]
Alright, thanks again everyone for coming out and supporting the Aldergrove Boxing Team.
Good job, kid.
We couldn't do it without you, looking forward to another successful season, see you all at the first fight.
So, you going to stick around?
No, I'm going to get moving kid.
I've got some dreams I want to chase.
These are yours, so.
No, no, hang on to them, they look good on you, okay?
Okay.
Listen, I'll see you down the road, alright.
It's been a pleasure.
Thanks coach, happy trails.
Hey.
You were amazing!
You totally surprised me.
I surprised myself.
You were transformed.
Not completely.
Mom!
Matthew!
You were so brave!
So ridiculously brave!
Did you actually see me or were you watching through your fingers?
No, I kept my eyes open for the most part,
I'm a big girl now.
Alright, picture time, get in close in, guys.
Alright.
Well, look at that, three generations.
Alright.
Is this Ruby?
Yeah, that's Rub.
Well get in there, dear.
There we go.
Where's Dan the man?
He left.
He's gone?
Like, really gone?
Yeah, like totally gone.
You're okay with that?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Just shows you Matt, a good coach makes all the difference.
There we go.
I'll take it, you get in there.

Matthew, stop it.
Stop it, Matthe.
Matthew!
What?
The nails, stop biting your nails.
Look at this place.
Who lives here?
Who would want to live here?
It's nowhere.
Look, I know this can't be easy for you.
New school, new town.
New house and a big new daddy.
Hey, that's not fair, Matt.
Jacob is the best thing that's happened to me in forever.
So, I'm sorry that we had to pull you out of private school.
I had a scholarship!
Yes, I know, and it helped.
But we are maxed out.
Look, I need you to pitch in, okay?
That's the way it is and public school is part of it.
Mom, I had a life, I had friends.
Nobody I know has even heard of this school.
You're going to make new friends.
Mom, you have no idea what it's like to be the new kid.
I might as well have a kick me sign on my back.
Oh honey, you're being a little dramatic.
You're smart, you'll adapt.
Very few kids have been through what you've been through.
You're a fighter, huh?
And you're going to do just fine.
No, I'm going to hate this school and I know it.
See, honey?
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Want me to come in with you?
No, mom.
It's okay, I've got this.
Can I have a kiss goodbye?
No!
I'm not a baby anymore, mom!
Thanks for the ride.
Okay, well you have a great day, and you are still my baby.
Mom!
:
Good morning students, welcome back to Aldergrove Secondary.
Schedules are now available in the office.
Please collect them and make your way to home room and classes will begin promptly in 10 minutes.
Have a great day, make this the start of a great year.
Because you're in high school now you can expect to do more homework without anyone reminding you and more reading.
Here's the reading list, it's long, and a breakdown of the assignments.
:
Aww!
Alright, calm down.
It isn't going to be that bad.
But you won't be able to float through this course.
Hi.
Hello.
I'm Matthew Miller, I think I'm in this class.
Yeah, and I think you're late, Point Dexter.
Go to the office.
Mr. Worthlin, that is not how we treat new students.
You can work on your manners in detention.
Find a seat, Matthew.
Come on, I was kidding.
This guys my friend, we were just kidding around, right bro?
Yeah, we're friends.
It was a joke.
Yeah, see?
That doesn't make any difference to me.
I expect a certain standard of behaviour in my class.
Our first book of this year will be Metropolis which was made into a movie which remains an icon on film making.
This novel came first however, and it explores the themes of class struggle and genetic manipulation.
I want you to write a paper exploring these issues presented almost 100 years ago and how they've changed or not changed since then.
First day of school, I get detention.
What's up with that?
Hey, thanks for helping me out, man.
Yeah well, I didn't help much.
Yeah, well, still.
You tuned in real quick.
I'm Nick.
I'm Matthew.
So, what's it like to be the new kid?
It sucks.
Yeah, well, just make sure you report to the lunch room at 1:00 p.m. for the new kid beat down.
Wait, what?
Dude, I'm joking.
Lighten up man.
Real funny.
Oh, and Mateo, lose the suit man, you're just asking for it.
Thanks.
Hey.
Hey, how's it going?
Fine.
Yeah, well I'm really happy to see you getting your room together.
Can I use sticky tac?
Yeah, sure, yeah.
Whatever you want.
It's your room.
Just no open fires.
Here let me help you with that.
No, it's fine, I got it.
Okay.
He's cool, who's that?
My grandfather.
Really?
That's your mom's dad?
Yeah.
Your mom told me he was a car salesman.
He is, but before that he was a fighter and then a referee.
He does live in Florida though, right?
Yeah.
Huh.
I need to do some homework.
Now.
Yeah yeah, sure sure.
Alright, well, if you need any help
I'll be right out there.
Yeah.
Look at those pom poms.
See you at the sock hop.
What's up, Point Dexter?
Nothing.
Are you Matthew?
Hi, I'm Ruby.
You want to eat with us?
I'm okay.
Oh, come on, dude.
Eat with us.
We won't bite.
Well, I might.
Oh, Point Dexter tried to save me from detention in Mrs. Nasher's class yesterda.
How noble of him.
Yeah.
Sit down, dude.
Um, okay.
So, you want to join our crew?
What crew?
The Ghetto Crew.
We're the coolest non-club in school.
What's a non-club?
We're like the anti-club.
We're cooler than clubs.
Oh, so like an exclusive club.
You know it, and our goal is epic world domination.
Yeah, we're taking it back from all those jocks and stuck up losers.
Okay.
I like it, so what do I have to do?
Nothing.
That's the beauty of it.
Absolutely nothing.
Except, you got to go up to that girl Theresa, the tall one with the big smile, and ask her for a date.
What?
Don't do it, Point Dexter.
I'm not very, really...
This is important, he has to do it if he wants to get in the crew.
He can do it if he wants to get his face punched.
Yeah, I...
Are you going to do it or not?
Okay, you know what, sure.
I'll do it.
Perfect, show us your skills.
Yeah, okay.
Hi Theresa.
Did you say my name?
Yeah, hi, I'm Matthew, I'm the new kid here and I'm just kind of wondering if you ever wanted to maybe consider ever hanging out or going out or something sometime.
Whatever.
Okay, it was very nice to meet you Theresa.
This guy bugging you, Theresa?
No.
Were you checking out my girlfriend?
No, I was just -
What are you staring at your big ugly shoes for?
I'm talking to you, look at me!
I was just, I -
- I -
Is this kid stupid or something?
I'm sorry.
Oh I'm sorry.
Sorry didn't do it, you did.
Ahhh!
Hector!
What?
Are you crying?
No, I'm not crying!
Alright, this wimps going to get us in trouble.
Come on, let's eat.
Look, I'm watching you, loser.
Hey, you okay?
I'm fine, I'm not crying!
Yeah, sure.
Where's your next class?
It's Math, it's room 129.
That's right next to my room, I'll walk with you.
:
Are you okay?
What happened?
How's it going?
It's fine.
You like books, huh?
Some of them.
Here.
I found that at a book store on my lunch break,
I thought you might like it.
Jacob, thank you!
This is, this is Muhammed Ali standing over Sonny Liston, it's what they call a phantom punch.
They say that Ali knocked him out with a punch nobody even saw.
Yeah, yeah.
My Dad told me about that fight.
That must have been something, huh?
Yeah.
Hey guys, I made a cake.
Chocolate.
Fight you for the last piece.
Yeah, yeah.
Come on!
I'll phantom punch you.
Stop right here.
Okay.
You don't need to pick me up after school because I think I'm going to walk home.
Have a good day.
Yup, thanks Mom.
Check out this guy right here, look at him.
Who said that you could use the front door, geek?
I just -
- I just --
I -
- I -
- What are you, Rain Man?
Speak up, punk?
Let me go!
Excuse me.
Is that your trash?
Is that yours?
No, it's this punks right here.
Hey, you wouldn't lie to me, would you?
It's not mine, so.
Really.
But you will clean it up, right?
Yes sir.
Thank you.
You boys can go to class.
What's the janitor going to do?
Mop me up?
Thanks.
Yeah, no need.
It's my job to clean up the trash around here.
So, you like boxing?
Yeah, I love it.
Do you box?
No.
What's so funny?
It's nothing.
They have a boxing club here you know, it's pretty cool.
You can practice, compete, and the whole bit.
Really?
Yeah.
Got to get back to work.
Look into it.
Okay!
Hector, come on!
He isn't worth it!
What do you want?
Nothing, I just think you're so cool.
Look, I don't want any trouble.
Trouble, what's this?
Give that back!
Matthew the Mighty, Matthew the Bull!
Dude, you are a trip.
Look, I want it back so just give it!
Hey, you need to relax.
Okay?
Alright?
Just relax.
Did you just try to bite me?
No!
Why don't you pick on someone else, Hector?
Oh look, this guy has new friends.
Yeah, I should have known you would hang out with this wimp.
Oh yeah, well it's better than hanging out with a meathead.
Watch your mouth!
Bird brain.
Hey, don't touch him!
You want to go?
You want to go?
We're going to get in trouble, stop!
Come on let's go, you and me, right now, right now.
let's do it!
Hey, Nasty Nasher.
Hey Doyle, how was your summer?
Brief.
Okay.
Since nobody wants to tell me what happened you both have detention for a week.
What?
Does that include Hector and Theresa?
I'll be talking to them.
This is not a good way to start the year.
I hope it's the last time I see you in my office, do you understand?
Yes, ma'am.
Okay, you go to class, Matthew I want you to stay.
Nick, shut the door please.
Nicholas.
Mr. Doyle.
Look at me, Matthew.
Matthew.
Actions have consequences, Matthew.
Even though it's hard being the new kid you need to try and steer clear of trouble.
We didn't start anything, that guy Hector did, this detention is not fair!
Not everything is fair.
But in the future if you run into trouble call a teacher, don't try and figure it out on your own.
Now go to class, and think about what I said.
So, Matthew, is there something that you would like to tell us?
Yeah, yeah there is.
I am trying out for the boxing team at school.
They have a boxing club, huh?
You know how I feel about boxing.
It is a brutal and pointless sport that leads nowhere.
So, is there something else?
Okay, you know what, I'm not hungry.
Sit down, Matthew.
Your principal phoned me today and told me that you have detention for one week?
It's not my fault Mom, this guy was trying to bully me.
He started it and I got blamed.
That's all, I swear.
Well then stay away from him.
Did you get hurt?
No Mom, I didn't get hurt.
Look, I just need you to sign this permission form so I can try out for the team.
What has gotten into you?
What has gotten into me?
You moved me away from all my friends out here to nowheresville, that is what has gotten into me.
Hey, don't raise your voice to your mother like that.
Aw, thanks for your input, Dad!
Matthew, go to your room!
With pleasure!
Come in.
Matthew.
What?
I need you to try and make this work, okay?
I know that it is an adjustment but for me, please.
Mom, I am trying to adjust but you can't just expect it to happen like that.
Listen, Jacob and I have been talking.
So just tell me a little bit more about this boxing thing.
There's nothing really to tell,
I just need your permission.
But honey, you've never really boxed before.
Yeah, but I've always wanted to and there are plenty of fighters who started young.
Mike Tyson won the heavyweight title when he was 20.
That's only five years older than me and Wilfred Benitez, well he was world ranked when he was my age.
And Sugar Ray Leonard, he won before he was 20,
Grandpa won the middleweight
Okay, okay, Matthew, I get it.
We know what Grandpa won.
That is not the point.
Would you just sign it?
Boxing is so dangerous.
You know what could happen, you're not always a winner.
Yeah, but you're always telling me that I'm a fighter.
Yeah, I am, and you are.
When you were sick you amazed everybody.
And I want you to be happy, but I cannot stand the thought of you getting sucked into that world.
Mom...
Of you getting hurt!
It's too much for me to handle right now.
Okay?
I just want things to be normal.
It is no kind of life, Matthew.
Mom, you can't blame everything on boxing.
Okay, listen, listen.
Let's just get settled, make some friends, and then do something else.
Do anything else.
Okay.
I'll do my best.
I know you will.
Thank you.
I'm so relieved.
Mom, good night!
Jab, jab, jab!
Good.
Nice work.
Come on now, cover it up, you're giving him a big target.
That's it.
That's it.
Jab, jab.
Come on guys, let's switch it up a little bit.
Come on, come on.
Nice, get him on the ropes, get him on the ropes.
Good, good, good, good, good.
Cover up, cover up.
Jab, jab, jab, get him in the corner.
Get him in the corner, come on, that's it.
That's it, nice.
Jab, jab, jab, alright, time, good work you guys.
Good work.
Okay, boys bring it over here.
Gentlemen, welcome.
The boxing program at the Aldergrove Secondary School is second to none.
Each year we take a few spots at the national championships for the AIBA.
If you're lucky, one, maybe two of you are going to make this team.
Now, most of these spots are already filled but each weight division needs an alternate just in case the champion in that division can't compete.
So today I'm going to choose two contenders for each division.
Now come eight weeks time we're going to have the Aldergrove box-off where those two contenders are going to have a chance to challenge the current champion for that position.
What that means is that it's sink or swim guys, it's gutter time.
Each one of you will be sparring for 30 seconds with one of Aldergrove's top boxers.
Today, some of you will be boxing against Joe Fielder and some of you will be sparring against Hector Torres.
Last year Joe took the light heavy weight title for the 16 and under division and Hector won the State Championship for the middleweight division, all for Aldergrove.
Get in there and get warmed up you guys.
And the rest of you, I want you to line up and put your name and your weight down on this clipboard, let's go.
Hey, where are you going?
I just forgot I had something to do.
I thought you were going to try out.
I, I was but um, that guy Hector really annoys me so I'm just going to go.
Well, that's a good thing because you can use that feeling against him in the ring.
Yeah, well, he makes me really nervous.
So what, you don't think Joe Fraser was nervous when he fought Ali?
You think Fraser wasn't afraid of him?
What about Mustard Douglas?
You don't think he's afraid of Iron Mike?
They were, they were like--
No, no, there's no difference.
They were once a couple of nervous kids like you.
So, go on champ.
Go make them nervous.
Okay.
That's it.
Some guys are cheating here, come on guys, let's play fair out there.
Hey, new guy, get in there and impress me.
Nice, nice, nice.
Jab!
Come on, jab jab jab!
That's it, jab, jab.
Jab, jab, jab, good, good, good.
Get the combo on him, Joe, that's it.
That's it.
That's it.
Nice, nice, nice, new guy!
Well done!
Block him Joe, good good good!
Way to break out of there boy.
Take him to the corner, take him to the corner, come on!
That's it, that's it, put him down, put him down.
Good, good.
Okay, that's enough for you, buddy.
Step out.
Good.
Get him in the corner, Hector, get him in the corner, put him down.
That's it, that's it.
Good good.
Good, good, that's it, that's it, nice, nice.
Way to cover new guy, well done.
Nice.
Good, good, finish him off, finish hard, finish hard, time.
Nice work.
Nice work, good stuff.
Miller, Matthew Miller.
Matthew Miller!
Here!
Time to get in the ring, boy.
let's see what you got.
Okay new guy, 30 seconds to prove yourselves, keep your punches clean and above the belt, alright?
Hey coach, coach, let me tell you this, okay?
Okay you ready?
Hector, you ready?
Alright, let's box.
Alright, come on Hector!
Woah!
Keep it light, Hector.
Time!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
I said time!
Cheap shot me, I'll kill you!
Over there, Hector!
What's your problem, kid?
I call time, you stop punching.
Get out of my gym, go!
Shake it off, Hector.
You okay, champ?
I made a fool of myself.
Yeah, I saw that.
Yeah?
So then you saw me freak out.
Hey, but you were in there though.
It takes more guts than most people have just to get in the ring.
I didn't expect Hector to be so fast, he threw a lot of punches.
Well, he is fast.
But to your credit you took all those punches.
Yeah, to the face!
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Well, Hector and his goons have a lot to laugh about now.
I just wish I could go back to my old school.
You know, from what I saw
I just think you need to keep your form in check and learn to relax.
Yeah, like you know about boxing.
Hey kids, I had dreams of being a heavyweight champion of the world.
Really?
I was climbing up the ranks and everything.
To make a long story short, driving fast and showing off finally caught up with me and put an end to all that, so I know a thing or two about the fighting game.
Well, do you think I could be any good?
It's going to take a lot of practice.
Yeah, well, you're not going to see me in that ring any time soon.
Coach kicked me out.
Thanks anyway.
I'm Matthew.
Dan.
Hey, who's that kid with the glasses?
That's me back in the day.
You must have been really good to win that trophy.
Yeah, I was alright.
I'm sorry about what happened to you.
Don't be, I'm not.
I got married, my wife and I started having kids and I needed to earn a living so it all worked out.
You couldn't make money boxing?
Well, you don't get into boxing to make money.
You get into boxing to be the champ.
You know for every Oscar De La Hoya there are thousands of fighters who never make a dime.
You know, either because they don't have enough talent or they don't have the right management.
And in my case it was just a guy who was living way too fast.
So, aren't you mad?
Nah, not anymore.
You've got to learn to live with it.
Let me tell you something, I still love the sport.
Do you, do you think you could,
I don't know, teach me a boxing move?
Alright, I'll show you a jab, that's the most important punch.
Okay.
You come ready, don't you?
Alright.
If you're going to throw a jab you've got to have a stance first so let me see your stance.
Okay, now widen your feet a little bit.
Okay, a little bend in the knees.
Okay.
There you go.
See if I come in and try and push you
I don't want to be able to move you.
See, that's good balance.
If you're too narrow not good.
Okay the jabs the left hand, let me see that jab.
Okay, not bad just throw it straighter, right down the pipe.
There you go.
See this jab is going to keep the other fighter from getting his rhythm, okay?
Okay.
You can use this jab to find your range, okay.
You always want to keep your hands up high, you don't want to drop them down here.
Yeah, yeah, like Tommy Hearns.
Yeah, yeah, but just remember you're not Tommy Hearns.
Okay.
Throw that jab.
Okay.
There you go, straight down the pipe.
There you go, come on, throw that jab.
Alright, lessons over.
Hey, do you think I could maybe come back here after school and you could show me some more stuff then?
Yeah, sure.
Maybe you could even train me.
Well, I don't know about that.
Come on, please Dan, we could just do it in here.
I just want to learn how to box so bad.
Well, let's just put a hold on that for now.
Okay, but I'm going to come right back here after sixth period.
Fine.
Thanks Dan.
Jab.
Jab.
1, 2.
1, 2.
1, 2.
Stop.
Will you do me a favour, take the glasses off, see if you can do it without them.
Okay.
Jab.
Jab.
1, 2.
1, 2.
Right hand.
There you go.
Starting to see some natural abilities in there.
Looking good.
My grandfather was a boxer, Charlie Putnam.
Yeah, I knew Charlie.
He was refereeing last time I saw him, good guy.
Jab.
1, 2.
There you go, 1, 2.
1, 2.
Alright.
Uh huh.
See, now if I start throwing punches at you you're right to cover up but you've got to keep your eyes open and look for openings, okay?
Anticipate.
Jab.
1, 2.
Jab.
1, 2.
Alright, you done any running?
I run away a lot.
I will start running to and from school.
Alright, that's good, but you need to add in some roadwork.
I guess.
Do we really have to do eight laps?
Well you do.
I'm going to stop here pretty soon.
Maybe I will too.
Hey, if you're going to be a champ you've got to train like a champ.
Oh, and if you can you've got to hold your hands up when you run.
When I used to do my road work
I threw punches when I ran.
That's good practice, it's going to help you build up your endurance before a fight.
Okay, I think we should stop soon.
I'm getting kind of dizzy.
Yeah.
Well, we almost did four laps.
Yeah, I guess a miles good for the first day.
So, did you know I'm a nerd?
Well, the socks kind of gave it away.
Yeah, my Mom has this idea that I'm going to be a lawyer or a doctor or some kind of guy that wears a suit.
Can't blame her for that.
Sounds like every Mom.
Yeah, boxing's not really on her list.
She thinks I'm going to get hurt or become irresponsible.
And I was really sick as a baby so.
Like serious sick?
Like, leukemia.
But it's okay because I'm good now, so it's okay.
I don't know.
Maybe you ought listen to her.
But if Evander Holyfield cae back and beat Mike Tyson after a heart problem and Wayne McCullough has a cyst in his head, he still fights.
Yeah, but kid.
You've got a lot more options than they had.
I guess, I don't know.
You know in boxing there's a lot more going on than the opponent standing in front of you, and there are a lot of elements that go into winning a fight.
Now I think training is important but your mindset, now that's the real key.
It takes a lot of concentration.
Now you've got to block out things inside that ring that don't have anything to do with your opponent.
Yeah, it's like when I'm doing trigonometry.
Well, there's a difference between a Math problem and a fight.
Say you're in a fight, okay, now you're dead tired.
Now your body aches.
Now you've got a cut, you've got blood dripping in your eyes.
But you've got to block all of that out and still win the fight.
So, are you going to train me?
Yes.
But it's our secret.
It's going to be one hour a day, Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
Now on the off days you run this track.
Okay.
Eight laps.
Okay.
And don't neglect your studies.
I won't, this school is so easy.
You're going to train me.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Whooo!
Yes, you're going to train me!
Thank you, Dan!
Yes!
Okay, what about this one?
No.
Mom, you said to get whatever I wanted.
Yeah, but you don't have to go along with the crowd.
Fine.
Okay, this, this is the last one.
Oh.
I like that one, that one is good.
Yeah, yeah, okay.
But no jeans that hang low on the bum okay,
I hate those.
So, these are returns, agreed?
Yeah, fine.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hey look at this, I barely even recognized him,
I thought he was Lennox Lewis.
Look at those boxing gloves.
Yeah dude, the freaking janitor,
Dan the muscle man is training him.
How do you know?
I saw them running the track the other day.
My God, that is too funny.
Hey look, I'm Matthew.
Ow, ow, it hurts, boxing, ow.
What a freaking loser.
Where are your glasses?
I only really need them for distance.
So, I should stay close then?
Yeah, that would be good.
So, you want to go to the mall?
Yeah, I do but I can't, I've got to be somewhere.
Yeah?
Where?
A secret meeting?
Another life?
Not exactly.
I've got to go for a run.
That's cool, but I hate running.
Yeah well, I'm in training right now with a trainer.
That's cool in a Karate Kid kind of way.
Yeah, yeah, it's awesome.
I mean, it's all about self-discipline.
It's not about starting fights, it's about defending yourself.
Too bad Hector doesn't know that,
I mean the guy is such an idiot.
Yeah, you don't have to tell me.
You know, you're not like any girl I've ever met.
Woah, where did that come from?
I don't know.
You're always acting tough and you hang out with guys, not girls.
Yeah well, I'm not really like most girls,
I'm not exactly the Miley Cyrus type.
Yeah, you're always drawing in that book.
Yeah.
Can I see some of your stuff?
Um, these are just scribbles, I mean.
I won't tell anyone.
Okay, well only if you promise not to laugh.
I don't think I could handle that kind of rejection.
I won't, I swear I won't.
Oh wow.
What do you think?
Ruby, these are, these are really good, not like comic book good but I mean like.
Seriously?
Yeah, you remind me a lot like this artist, Klee.
Who's that?
Paul Klee, he started drawing with like chalk on the sidewalk, you know, graffiti kind of stuff.
But he did some crazy caricatures and I mean, like, you'd love him.
You know, I drew a picture of you.
Really?
Sure, I didn't have anything better to do.
Wow.
That, now that is art.
It's nice, it's very perceptive.
You know, it's so weird, you're such a...
What, a nerd?
A softy.
I can't believe you want to box.
Yeah, well, it's, um, it's in my blood.
Hey!
Time!
Nice, that's good enough for today.
Yeah.
You know, for someone who's never boxed before you catch on pretty quick.
Must be genetics.
Dan, no, I'm in the zone, I can tell,
I'm going to be good at this.
That's good kid, setting goals is good, it leads to progress.
Speaking of progress I've got to get to work.
Or I'll never get out of here tonight.
Do you want me to give you a hand?
I feel like I owe you.
No, no, no.
It does me good to put the pads on anyway.
Besides I'm sure you've got better things to do than clean up the girls washroom.
Yeah, maybe.
You know, I'm going to call a friend of mine that has a gym, see if we can get you some real sparring time.
Really?
Yeah.
Hey Dan, do you mind if I maybe take these gloves home?
Because I want to practice but the only ones I have are the ones Grandpa gave me when I was 10 and they're like completely worn out.
Yeah, yeah, sure, you've just got to keep this on the down low.
I mean tell your folks and all but you've got to keep this between you and me.
Okay, I understand.
Hey loser.
Come on, Hector.
Leave him alone!
You're going to get me kicked off the cheerleading squad!
Hey loser, are you deaf or something?
That was a pretty good hit you got me with.
Yeah, it was, but it was also a mistake and it cost me a spot on the team so you should be thrilled.
Thrilled?
No, no, see that's why I wanted to talk to you.
See, I told the coach that he should give you another chance.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, I said you hit really hard so he said to find you and tell you to come to the gym today after school because he's giving you and a couple other guys one more shot.
You see, he's not totally satisfied with the roster.
Really?
Yeah.
Is it just today because there's somewhere
I usually go after school?
Sorry, it's only today, man.
Okay, I guess I'll see you there.
Alright, see you there.
Is there really a special tryout?
Oh yeah, it's very special.
Hey, where's Coach Harwood?
He'll be here in a bit.
Yeah.
He just told us to start sparring first so why don't you put these on.
I was just going to use my gloves.
Oh, these are better.
Okay.
What about headgear?
I don't have any.
I've got some for you.
Here.
Um, who's going to keep time?
I will.
Okay.
Ding ding ding!
Here we go Hector!
So Matthew, why do you hang out with those losers?
They're not losers, they're my friends.
Hey, this guy can really hit.
Maybe he should be on the team.
Hey, ow!
I thought we were just sparring?
Yeah, that's over now, loser.
Ow!
You almost got us in trouble the other day so now you get this.
Ow!
What are you even doing here?
You don't belong at this school, you belong at a school for nerds.
Stop it!
Hey, Hector.
Shut up, this pansy needs to learn his lesson.
You want to box?
Come on.
You want to box?
Come on!
Hey, what are you guys doing?
!
Nothing, we were just sparring.
It looked like more than sparring to me.
What are you going to do about it anyway?
You're just the janitor so why don't you come in here and mop it up.
What are you going to do about it?
You're right punk, I am the janitor.
You're lucky I don't mop the floor up with you.
Are you threatening me?
It's not a threat, it's a fact.
Now get out of here.
What's going on here?
You tell me.
This kids not part of my program and neither are you.
You better talk to your boy Hector.
I will, get over here Hector.
You stay out of this, Dan.
You okay, kid?
No, I need to lie down.
Come on, let's get you up.
I can't.
I can't get up.
Come on, I'll give you a ride home.
Here, look up.
Matthew?
Matthew?
Hey, what happened, baby?
Nothing Mom, everything is fine, just leave me alone right now please.
Is that guy still bothering you?
Mom, stay out of it.
I'm going to call the school.
No, Mom, don't do that.
Look at me, Matthew.
Matthew, look at me.
Oh no, this is unacceptable, I am telling the principal.
Mom, it's just a bruise, if you jump in it's not going to make anything better it's going to make everything worse.
I can try to deal with this on my own.
No, I think you've had enough trying it on your own.
I agree with Matthew, I think maybe you and I should hold off before we get involved.
But, look!
He's not a kid, he's a young man.
A lot of people were there, even a teacher saw it okay.
Now I can do this, so just let me.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll go make some pizza, from scratch.
Hey Dan!
What do you want?
Mind if I come in?
Free country.
Hey Dan, I've got to talk to you.
So talk.
Can you turn that thing off?
Yeah, I'm just finishing up.
You know that kid had no right being in a boxing ring.
Yeah, and your kid had no business doing what he did.
I already spoke to him, he's going to apologize personally and he promises to stay away from your kid.
The kid's name is Matthew.
Swell, he promises to stay away from Matthew.
So, that's it?
Hector beats up a kid for no reason and you just talk to him, he should be suspended.
Quite frankly he should be arrested.
Dan.
You know I'm right, but you're not going to let anything happen to him.
Bottom line is Hector Torres is the best fighter this school, this town, has ever had.
He's fighting the toughest league in the state and no one can compete with him, the kid's going to the amateurs.
Oh then he's going to the pros, maybe the Olympics first.
And if you're lucky you'll be there to carry his spit bucket.
It's a heck of a lot better than cleaning up after him.
I know what you're doing.
I'm doing it too, alright.
We see ourselves in these kids and we push them to be great, the only difference is my kid's got it and your's doesn't.
And if you don't put an end to it he's going to wind up just like you, hurt and defeated.
You know, you may be right about me.
Because when you and I were coming up
I did everything the wrong way.
And I put my ego in front of the sport.
But this kid has something that you and I and Hector don't have.
This kids got heart.
Heart.
Come on Dan.
Look at you, you're out with an injury, me, well let's just say I'm better off behind the ropes.
But Hector's got what it takes to go the distance.
Yeah, well I'm willing to bet you wrong about Matthew.
I'll make you a deal.
What kind of deal?
Let Matthew fight in the box-off, just give him a fair shot.
Let him fight Hector inside the ropes with a ref.
Are you crazy?
I'll train him and take full responsibility.
Or I'd be happy to talk to the principal about what happened yesterday.
Maybe he'd like to see Matthew's shiner, maybe he'd like to talk to a few of the witnesses.
You're serious?
Yeah, I'm dead serious.
The kids got no style, he can't compete, he's going to get hurt out there.
I believe in him.
Alright, alright, fine.
But you get the parents to sign off on this.
No problem.
Hey Champ, what's up?
Nothing.
Yeah, I was looking for you.
Are you coming by the shop?
Maybe not today.
Missing a day, huh?
That's no way to train, Matthew.
I know, it's just, I just...
Just what?
Hey kid, you hit the mat.
Every champion hits the mat sooner or later, the question is are you going to get back up?
I just don't know if I have what it takes.
You know who Cus D'Amato was?
Yeah sure, he trained Mike Tyson.
So then you know the story about the hero and the coward.
Sort of.
The hero is the hero because he's not afraid and the coward is the coward because he is.
Something like that, but it's not just about being scared.
It's what you do when you feel that way, how you react to your fear, that's what makes you the hero or the coward.
So, what am I?
You tell me.
I'm not going to lie to you, Matthew.
There's no guarantees.
Every fight is different, but it's you who determines who you are.
A misfit.
We're all misfits.
But the only person who can stop you from doing something is you.
So, are we going to train or not?
You got a fight coming up.
Wait, what?
I do?
Coach Howard agreed to let you back in the box-offs.
Woah, woah, Dan, how does that work?
Every contender fights Hector Torres.
You are a contender.
Dan, he's going to kill me!
Yeah, maybe, but if you win you're on the team.
Yeah, and if I lose?
You did your best and that's good enough now pick up your books.
That's it!
That's it!
Work, work!
Try to buy time.
Good job.
You're definitely getting faster, Matthew.
Yeah, I've been running like you told me to.
Well good, because against Hector you're going to need to throw punches for three minutes of every round, okay?
You show him you're not afraid, that's going to change everything.
I don't know, Dan.
Do you really think that I've got a shot here?
Kid, this is boxing.
Anything can happen.
I talked to my buddy Avery, he said we could use the gym.
So I'll set you up a sparring session.
Yeah?
Yeah, but before that happens you're going to have to get these release forms signed by your parents.
Otherwise you can't compete and I can't take you off campus.
Do you want me to talk to them?
No, no, it's okay.
I've got this.
Okay, good job.
Thanks Dan.
Okay, honey.
We're leaving now.
Okay.
Back around 11.
Yeah sure, have a good night.
See ya.
Bye.
Alright, you know what a fighter's greatest asset is?
Power.
No.
What, speed?
No, those two things are important but most of all, and this is what helped Foreman win the title at 40.
45.
45.
What helped him win the title at 45 was just being relaxed in the ring.
The key to being relaxed in the ring is not getting psyched out by what your opponent is trying to do.
Don't worry about him, just fight your fight.
Stick to your game plan.
Okay.
Use that jab and find your range, okay?
Uh huh.
Step in.
Alright, you guys keep it light.
Ready, let's box!
Come on Matthew, punch.
Time!
Kid, who's your favourite defensive fighter?
Marlon Starling was supposedly pretty good.
Well, as good as he was he still threw a punch from time to time.
So, throw more punches?
Please, keep your hands up, just like we talked about at school.
Ready?
Hands up.
Alright, let's box!
Go to the body, Matthew,
Don't look at me!
You gotta do something, Matthew!
You're not going to have any help in there with Hector.
Do something!
Come on Matthew!
Yes!
That a way.
Time!
Yes!
Yes, sir.
Good job.
How do you feel?
I feel good.
You rocked it.
You really rocked it.
Jab!
Jab!
Jab right hand!
Jab right hand!
And the champion of Aldergrove Secondary School is Matthew Miller!
1, 2.
Time.
Looking good, Matthew.
Looking real good.
As good as Hector?
Don't you worry about Hector.
I have to, he's the school champion.
So what?
Sometimes the champion isn't as interesting as the challenger.
I guess.
See that picture there in the middle?
Yeah.
That's me and Coach Howard.
The boxing coach at school?
Yeah.
It's the day we fought the Golden Gloves when we were your age.
Did you win?
Well, I'm not the one holding the trophy but I thought I won.
A lot of people thought I won.
Sometimes the judges seems like they see a different fight.
Yeah, that's like when James Toney fought Dave Taberi.
I'm not sure I remember that one.
Well, supposedly Taberi won the fight but the judges gave Toney the decision.
Now that fight was in 1992 before I was born and Taberi never fought again.
Can't win them all, that's why you've got to love the sport and not the glory.
Yeah.
Need a ride home?
No, I'm just going to bike it home.
Are we looking for a house?
You know, you guys can just let me out and I can find it myself.
You don't need to waste your time.
No, I want to know where you're going, we'll pick you up.
Okay.
She said it's number 1042.
Are her parents going to be home?
Probably.
There!
That's it!
Kind of an odd neighbourhood.
She lives here?
Well, maybe her parents work from home.
That's not all that uncommon.
Is that Ruby?
Yup, that's great.
Thanks Jacob.
Bye Mom.
I just want to get out.
No, please don't.
Just pick me up at 11, okay.
Thank you.
Matthew!
Hi.
Are those your parents?
Yeah, something like that.
Come on.
This is so cool.
I wonder how they did that, make movies like this back then.
It took forever,
I mean no one had ever seen anything like this.
Do your parents have a lot of movies?
Yeah.
Hundreds.
Thousands.
Wow, that's really cool.
What do your parents do?
Well, I don't really have a Dad and we lived with my Grandfather.
My Mom is a florist, she had her own shop and everything.
Cool.
She is so pretty.
Well, don't you think she's pretty?
Yeah, you are too.
Shut up!
Do you really think so?
Yeah.
Of course.
You're sweet.
Yo, Adrian!
We did it!
Yo!
Stop it, you're embarrassing me.
I'm sorry, just that was awesome.
Sit down.
Never been here with anyone before,
I mean I'm usually with my parents.
Yeah well, it's really cool just watching movies here like this, with you.
In our own private drive in and I think I'm going to kiss you again.
Has anyone ever told you just to be quiet?
Well, do you think I'm weird because I talk so much?
No, I think you're weird because you're weird.
Yes!
I mean, I think we should just kind of hang out.
More of the same.
Hey, loser!
Look, it's the loser and his loser girlfriend, the perfect couple.
Come on, Ruby.
You know what, leave us alone you meathead jock!
meathead jock.
Didn't Matthew tell you, he's a meathead jock now, we're going to be fighting.
And if he wins which is impossible he's going to be on the team.
Oh, he's going to win.
He's going to kick your butt in front of everybody.
Ruby.
You better tell your girl to watch her mouth or she might get you in trouble.
You know what, back off Hector.
What are you going to do if I don't?
Ahhh!
Don't even think about telling coach about this, okay, because you threw the first punch.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I hope you destroy that guy.
Yeah, me too.
So, Ruby said that you went over to her place on Saturday?
Actually, we watched that movie from English class at her parents drive in.
You should have called me, I have to watch that movie.
I mean, Mrs. Nasher's making me rewrite my paper because she doesn't think I read it.
Yeah, because you didn't.
I don't know, just go rent it or something.
So, what's going on between you two?
Normal stuff.
What's that mean?
Normal stuff?
Whatever guys and girls do that's normal.
Like kissing?
Yeah, that's normal, right?
Really?
Did you guys like french kiss or--?
Hey guys, what's up?
Hey, we were just talking about kissing you.
Nick!
What?
What did you tell him?
Don't be mad, it was just--
He told me you kissed.
Well, it's none of your pea-brained business!
What else did you say?
Nothing, he asked and I--
Come on, Ruby.
You guys are such losers.
Ruby, wait!
Nick!
Matthew, Matthew, wait, she's just PMSing.
No, she's mad.
No, now is not the time.
Trust me, your life is at risk.
Boring.
But is it Math?
Is it Math?
Looking good.
Looking good.
What is this?
Okay kids please, h thank you thank yo, that is wonderfu.
You just made my day.
Matthew, can I have a word with you?
Yeah, sure.
You having trouble with the assignments?
No, not really.
Really?
I only ask because you haven't turned in two so far this semester, you missed another one this week.
I'm so so sorry Mr. Doyle,
I'll make up the assignments I promise.
Okay, good.
Because you know, I'm here to help you.
Homework is important, it's worth half your grade.
I know, I just forgot.
Alright, so when are you going to have the assignments in by?
I don't know, soon I guess.
You guess?
It better be soon or I'm going to have to call your parents,
I only let students miss two assignments per semester, you're over the limit.
If you don't get good grades you can't sign up for any clubs or teams.
Wait, what if I just did them right now?
Right now?
Yeah, I've got a spare.
I can stay and we can do them right here, if you don't mind.
Sure, right now.
You're just going to do three assignments right now, in your spare.
Just right now.
Sure.
I can do it.
Of course, good idea.
Let's just do three assignments right now, there you go.
3, 2, 6, and 7, is 39...
I was laughing my head off.
Anyway, it wasn't until after that I realized
I had ketchup all over my --
I had ketchup all over my face.
It was like the most embarrassing thing ever.
Hey Dan!
Dan?
Mr. Barns?
Hey Mom.
Matthew.
Jacob, what are you doing home?
Why don't you come in the living room and talk with your mother and me.
What's going on?
Sit down.
Am I in trouble?
Yes.
Is this about my homework or my--
Is it true that you have been boxing at school and that the janitor has been coaching you?
His name is Dan and yeah I've been getting a few pointers.
But we agreed that you would not box!
Your mother was pretty clear how she felt about that.
Okay, why are you even here?
You're not my father.
Matthew, please!
Maybe, it's because my name is on the release form your principal brought with her today.
Apparently Coach Howard has agreed to let Matthew participate in the box-off.
Dan, Mr. Barns, was adamant that he had made it clear to Matthew that he needed to have one of you sign the permission form.
He understood that you had turned it into the office.
I'm very sorry about this, with upwards of 700 students we just can't know what they're doing all the time.
We expect our staff to be diligent and we had to let Dan go.
What?
How long has this been going on, Matthew?
This is not Dan's fault, this was my fault, he was just doing me a favour, he was standing up for me.
If he's not there then I quit.
I quit school, I don't care because this is wrong.
Be quiet, Matthew!
No, I will not be quiet!
What has gotten into you?
Mom, I need to do this because I am good at it and I need to be good at something,
I have put so much time and effort--
Yes!
And you lied to us!
Christine!
Hey, Matthew!
Alright, let's all just sit down and listen for a moment.
Mom, nobody thinks that I can make this team but I think I have a shot and Dan thinks I have a shot.
He's given me a chance to do something here, he's like my only friend, he's someone who actually believes in me!
Hey, I am somebody who actually believes in you.
Your mother is somebody who actually believes in you.
No she's not, she always thinks I'm going to fail or I'm going to get hurt or--
Well, we've been talking here and your mother and I have both agreed to let you fight in the box-offs.
With Dan's help!
No, absolutely not.
But he's my trainer!
Lower your voice, Matthew.
He shouldn't have been your trainer, that's the point.
He was fired because that's not his job and he shouldn't be interfering with students or their activities.
He did his job!
He didn't do anything wrong!
He knows more about boxing than that stupid coach at school.
I'm done.
Okay, I am leaving because this is wrong!
This is so wrong!
Matthew!
That'll get you there.
Thank you.
Alright.
Mr. Barns!
Hey, Matthew.
Sorry things turned out this way.
I'm sorry that I lied about getting my parents permission.
So am I kid.
I can't go back to that school if you're not there.
Don't get carried away kid, life goes on.
I'm sorry that you lost your job,
I wasn't trying to get you in trouble.
I agreed to be your trainer Matthew but you had to tell your parents.
That was our deal.
You broke the bond between trainer and fighter.
I know.
I know.
Relax kid, if anybody should be crying it oughta be me.
I'm the one that got fired, not you.
So, why aren't you?
You think I wanted to be a janitor the rest of my life?
Kid, I had dreams just like everybody else.
Lately they haven't seemed to go my way.
The question is what are you going to do?
About what?
Well, you've got a fight coming up.
Dan, I can't do it without you!
Well then what the heck are you doing this for, kid?
It hasn't been for me.
But you're not even going to be there!
Listen, kid.
You're alone anyway.
I'm not in the ring with you,
I don't have a pair of gloves on,
I'm just there in the corner to guide you along.
You know for three minutes of every round it's just you and your opponent.
Nothing else matters.
For three minutes of every round you get to show everybody exactly what Matthew Miller is made of.
I'm scared, Dan.
Hector wants you to feel scared, son.
He's expecting you not to fight.
But you show up win or lose as long as you get in that ring and do your best, you fight that fear, you win no matter what.
You think I can beat Hector?
It doesn't matter what I think, it matters what you think.
Now get out of here.
Morning.
Morning.
Oh, you should have come down quicker, it's probably all mushy by now.
Mom, it's fine.
I don't know if I can do this honey.
I mean I went once when I was a little girl to watch Dad and I,
I threw up, I just threw up when I saw Dad getting hit and all the blood and oh dear.
We don't have to go Christine.
Mom, it's fine.
Whatever you decide, it's okay.
Now, I'm going to go run a couple laps before first period.
Okay, I love you.
Bye, bye Jacob.
Love you.
Okay.
Hey Matthew.
Hey.
It's the big day.
Should we reserve a hospital bed for you?
Shut up, Nick.
Come on, I'm just joking.
You know, ease up the tension.
I hate boxing, I mean I hate sports, but I'm coming to watch you so if you win--
When he wins.
When you win just don't become a dumb jock, okay?
Come on, I won't!
Okay, well see you two.
Hey.
Hey.
How you been?
I've missed you.
I've missed you too okay, I'm sorry that I blabbed.
Hey, I totally overreacted.
I drew you.
You winning the boxing match.
Wow.
Ruby, that's just how I imagined it.
I'm not quite done though.
I think I'm going to add Hector somewhere in there, maybe on the floor, knocked out.
You know, I think I like it the way it is.
Just me.
Well, Mr. Confident.
I should probably be getting to class, but I'll see you later.
Oh yeah.
And, Matthew?
Yeah?
Good luck in the ring.
Look who showed up.
So, who's working your corner, Matthew?
He's so scared.
He can't talk.
Is that true?
Are you so scared you can't even speak?
No Hector.
I'm just too busy thinking about how stupid you sound when you open your mouth.
Oh-ho-ho.
And Joe, you smell like a dumpster, when was the last time you showered?
Now is your chance to laugh it up dork, because once we get in the ring one things for sure.
You're going to die.
Nice comeback, champ.
Dan!
How you doing, kid?
I'm good.
I'm nervous.
You should be nervous.
Five minutes, boys.
I just came to wish you good luck.
Thanks.
I just want you to block everything out and do what you've been taught to do.
I'll do my best.
Just remember, Hectors just as nervous as you are.
See you out there.
:
Please welcome our own Aldergrove boxing team, and Contenders.
Hey guys, how's it going?

Let's box!
Hey, long time no see.
Dad!
What are you doing here?
Your husband called me, I appreciate it sir.
Well, I knew he was going to be pleased, this is a huge day for him.
Glad to be here.
Hit him on the inside.
Follow it up!
Good job.
Let's hear it for our heavyweight contenders.
And now in our ligt heavyweight class please welcome our State champion in the 1600 divisio,

I want a clean fight, you got three rounds to make this team?
Any questions?
Alright, let's touch gloves, have a good fight.
Fight!
Come on Joe, you've got to hit him one time!
Yes!
Yes!
What?
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... :
Everybody's afraid, Matthew, but how you react to that fear is what makes you the hero or the coward.
...9
Hey, you ready?
You ready?
Yeah, yes!
Let's see what you got.
Okay.
Come on, Matt!
Go Matthew!
Come on, Matthew!
You can do it, come on!
:
You don't think Joe Fraser was nervous before he fought Ali?
Now, in the middleweight division our final contender and challenger, Matthew Miller!
And defending in this division, our state champion, Hector Torres.
Come over here, Hector.
Come on Hector, just do it!
Hey Miller!
:
You fight that fear and you'll win, no matter what.
Snap out of it!
Alright, remember, you've got three rounds, three minutes each.
No low blows, no rabbit punches, in case of a knock down
I want you to go to the neutral corner.
Alright.
If that ref says break,
I want you to break clean, any questions?
No one's in your corner, pansy.
Hey, take it easy Hector.
Whatever you say, coach.
Let's have a good fight!
Ready?
Ready?
Fight!
:
Hector wants you to be afraid, Matthew, he wants you to give up.
Hands up, Matthew, hands up!
Good job, Hector!
Oh my God.
I can't!
Okay, step back, come on, fight.
:
Don't worry about what Hector's doing, just fight your fight.
Nice!
Jab, Matthew, jab!
Alright, over to the corner.
Keep it clean.
There's no one looking after that boy.
Start playing by the rules buddy, look at me when I'm talking to you!
How am I supposed to back you up if you're not playing by the rules, huh?
Don't blow this for yourself!
Here.
Now, sit sit sit.
Grandpa?
Here's some water, reach out your mouth.
What are you doing here?
Your new father called me, don't worry, it's all good.
Yeah.
Is Mom okay?
Just concentrate on the match.
You don't think about anything else.
That last round was good, but you've got to throw some more punches.
Yeah, I know, I'm counting.
Counting what?
Well, he throws six punches and then he breaks and that's when I've got to hit him.
That's a good observation.
But you've got to keep your hands up but don't lose sight of him, don't hide.
Come out with your hands nice and loose.
The last round you've got him good.
He got me, is there a lot of blood?
Nah, it's not much.
He fights like a baby.
Come on.
Go Matthew!
Take control!
:
If you're going to win this fight you have to block everything out.
Over there, over there!
Come on!
Come on, Matthew!
:
Keep your chin down, Matthew, eyes up.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
Yeah, that's right!
It's all me!
How you doing, son?
You had enough?
No.
He popped you good there, getting through those gloves.
There you go, cool you down.
Kid, how are you?
Dan!
You're doing great, keep working the body though, okay?
You find those ribs and you keep working those ribs, you pound him.
Three minutes to go in this fight.
Okay, you hear me?
The guy behind me he's getting sloppy and he's getting tired.
You see that, he's getting sloppy and tired.
Okay, this is your round, this is your round.
Okay?
Give me everything you got.
I will, I promise!
All in the ring.
I promise!
Oh, he's a baby.
After him.
Come on, Matthew!
Come on!
Concentrate, Matthew.
Come on, Matthew!
You can do it, come on!
:
Stay in the moment, Matthew.
Nothing else matters.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...
Yeah buddy, yeah!
Alright, let me see your gloves.
Fight.
Come on, Matthew!
Come on Matthew, come on!
:
This is your chance, Matthew, show the world exactly what you're made of.
Whooo!
Go Matthew!
Get over there and do the right thing, son.
Go on.
Hey, that was a good match, you hit pretty hard.
Yeah, you too.
So, after three great rounds of action the judges tally is in.
And the score is 2 rounds to 1, for the current middleweight champion of Aldergrove Secondary School, Hector Torres!
I think he did alright.
Yeah.
It's alright, Matt!
Way to go!
What?
I lost.
But you lasted three rounds kid, you showed the heart of a champion.
You're a winner to me all the way, son.
But I lost.
Yeah, that's how you do it!
I'm taking Aldergrove Secondary to the top, we're going to be the best in the whole league!
Yeah!
Let's go!
I just want you all to know what a great discovery
I think Matthew Miller is, and I definitely think there's room for him as an alternate in the middleweight division for the Aldergrove Boxing Team, what do you say?
After all, Hector graduates this year and we're going to need someone to win some championships for Aldergrove, how about that?
I want to be on the team, I want to be on the team.
Come on up here and say a couple words.
Thank you coach.
Well, I just wanted to thank my parents for always telling me that I'm a fighter.
My best friends Nick and Ruby for never letting me fight alone.
My grandpa for being in my corner and finally my coach, Dan Barns for telling me that I could be a champ.
Alright, thanks again everyone for coming out and supporting the Aldergrove Boxing Team.
Good job, kid.
We couldn't do it without you, looking forward to another successful season, see you all at the first fight.
So, you going to stick around?
No, I'm going to get moving kid.
I've got some dreams I want to chase.
These are yours, so.
No, no, hang on to them, they look good on you, okay?
Okay.
Listen, I'll see you down the road, alright.
It's been a pleasure.
Thanks coach, happy trails.
Hey.
You were amazing!
You totally surprised me.
I surprised myself.
You were transformed.
Not completely.
Mom!
Matthew!
You were so brave!
So ridiculously brave!
Did you actually see me or were you watching through your fingers?
No, I kept my eyes open for the most part,
I'm a big girl now.
Alright, picture time, get in close in, guys.
Alright.
Well, look at that, three generations.
Alright.
Is this Ruby?
Yeah, that's Rub.
Well get in there, dear.
There we go.
Where's Dan the man?
He left.
He's gone?
Like, really gone?
Yeah, like totally gone.
You're okay with that?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Just shows you Matt, a good coach makes all the difference.
There we go.
I'll take it, you get in there.

Matthew, stop it.
Stop it, Matthew.
Matthew.
What?
The nails, stop biting your nails.
Look at this place.
Who lives here?
Who would want to live here?
It's nowhere.
Look, I know this can't be easy for you.
New school, new town.
New house and a big new daddy.
Hey, that's not fair, Matt.
Jacob is the best thing that's happened to me in forever.
So, I am sorry that we had to pull you out of private school.
I had a scholarship.
Yes, I know, and it helped.
But we are maxed out.
Look, I need you to pitch in, okay?
That's the way it is and public school is part of it.
Mom, I had a life, I had friends.
Nobody I know has even heard of this school.
You're going to make new friends.
Mom, you have no idea what it's like to be the new kid.
I might as well have a kick me sign on my back.
Oh honey, you're being a little dramatic.
You're smart, you will adapt.
Very few kids have been through what you have been through.
You're a fighter, huh?
And you're going to do just fine.
No, I am going to hate this school and I know it.
See, honey?
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Want me to come in with you?
No, mom.
It's okay, I have got this.
Can I have a kiss goodbye?
No.
I am not a baby anymore, mom.
Thanks for the ride.
Okay, well you have a great day, and you are still my baby.
Mom.
Good morning students, welcome back to Aldergrove Secondary.
Schedules are now available in the office.
Please collect them and make your way to home room and classes will begin promptly in 10 minutes.
Have a great day, make this the start of a great year.
Because you're in high school now you can expect to do more homework without anyone reminding you and more reading.
Here's the reading list, it's long, and a breakdown of the assignments.
Aww.
Alright, calm down.
It isn't going to be that bad.
But you won't be able to float through this course.
Hi.
Hello.
I am Matthew Miller, I think I am in this class.
Yeah, and I think you're late, Point Dexter.
Go to the office.
Mr. Worthlin, that is not how we treat new students.
You can work on your manners in detention.
Find a seat, Matthew.
Come on, I was kidding.
This guys my friend, we were just kidding around, right bro?
Yeah, we're friends.
It was a joke.
Yeah, see?
That doesn't make any difference to me.
I expect a certain standard of behaviour in my class.
Our first book of this year will be Metropolis which was made into a movie which remains an icon on film making.
This novel came first however, and it explores the themes of class struggle and genetic manipulation.
I want you to write a paper exploring these issues presented almost 100 years ago and how they have changed or not changed since then.
First day of school, I get detention.
What's up with that?
Hey, thanks for helping me out, man.
Yeah well, I didn't help much.
Yeah, well, still.
You tuned in real quick.
I am Nick.
I am Matthew.
So, what's it like to be the new kid?
It sucks.
Yeah, well, just make sure you report to the lunch room at 1:00 p.m. for the new kid beat down.
Wait, what?
Dude, I am joking.
Lighten up man.
Real funny.
Oh, and Mateo, lose the suit man, you're just asking for it.
Thanks.
Hey.
Hey, how's it going?
Fine.
Yeah, well I am really happy to see you getting your room together.
Can I use sticky tac?
Yeah, sure, yeah.
Whatever you want.
It's your room.
Just no open fires.
Here let me help you with that.
No, it's fine, I got it.
Okay.
He's cool, who's that?
My grandfather.
Really?
That's your mom's dad?
Yeah.
Your mom told me he was a car salesman.
He is, but before that he was a fighter and then a referee.
He does live in Florida though, right?
Yeah.
Huh.
I need to do some homework.
Now.
Yeah yeah, sure sure.
Alright, well, if you need any help
I will be right out there.
Yeah.
Look at those pom poms.
See you at the sock hop.
What's up, Point Dexter?
Nothing.
Are you Matthew?
Hi, I am Ruby.
You want to eat with us?
I am okay.
Oh, come on, dude.
Eat with us.
We won't bite.
Well, I might.
Oh, Point Dexter tried to save me from detention in Mrs. Nasher's class yesterday.
How noble of him.
Yeah.
Sit down, dude.
Um, okay.
So, you want to join our crew?
What crew?
The Ghetto Crew.
We're the coolest non-club in school.
What's a non-club?
We're like the anti-club.
We're cooler than clubs.
Oh, so like an exclusive club.
You know it, and our goal is epic world domination.
Yeah, we're taking it back from all those jocks and stuck up losers.
Okay.
I like it, so what do I have to do?
Nothing.
That's the beauty of it.
Absolutely nothing.
Except, you got to go up to that girl Theresa, the tall one with the big smile, and ask her for a date.
What?
Don't do it, Point Dexter.
I am not very, really...
This is important, he has to do it if he wants to get in the crew.
He can do it if he wants to get his face punched.
Yeah, I...
Are you going to do it or not?
Okay, you know what, sure.
I will do it.
Perfect, show us your skills.
Yeah, okay.
Hi Theresa.
Did you say my name?
Yeah, hi, I am Matthew, I am the new kid here and I am just kind of wondering if you ever wanted to maybe consider ever hanging out or going out or something sometime.
Whatever.
Okay, it was very nice to meet you Theresa.
This guy bugging you, Theresa?
No.
Were you checking out my girlfriend?
No, I was just--
What are you staring at your big ugly shoes for?
I am talking to you, look at me.
I was just, I-
- I--
Is this kid stupid or something?
I am sorry.
Oh I am sorry.
Sorry didn't do it, you did.
Ahhh.
Hector.
What?
Are you crying?
No, I am not crying.
Alright, this wimps going to get us in trouble.
Come on, let's eat.
Look, I am watching you, loser.
Hey, you okay?
I am fine, I am not crying.
Yeah, sure.
Where's your next class?
It's Math, it's room 129.
That's right next to my room, I will walk with you.
Are you okay?
What happened?
How's it going?
It's fine.
You like books, huh?
Some of them.
Here.
I found that at a book store on my lunch break,
I thought you might like it.
Jacob, thank you.
This is, this is Muhammed Ali standing over Sonny Liston, it's what they call a phantom punch.
They say that Ali knocked him out with a punch nobody even saw.
Yeah, yeah.
My Dad told me about that fight.
That must have been something, huh?
Yeah.
Hey guys, I made a cake.
Chocolate.
Fight you for the last piece.
Yeah, yeah.
Come on.
I will phantom punch you.
Stop right here.
Okay.
You don't need to pick me up after school because I think I am going to walk home.
Have a good day.
Yup, thanks Mom.
Check out this guy right here, look at him.
Who said that you could use the front door, geek?
I just-
- I just--
I-
- I-
- What are you, Rain Man?
Speak up, punk?
Let me go.
Excuse me.
Is that your trash?
Is that yours?
No, it's this punks right here.
Hey, you wouldn't lie to me, would you?
It's not mine, so.
Really.
But you will clean it up, right?
Yes sir.
Thank you.
You boys can go to class.
What's the janitor going to do?
Mop me up?
Thanks.
Yeah, no need.
It's my job to clean up the trash around here.
So, you like boxing?
Yeah, I love it.
Do you box?
No.
What's so funny?
It's nothing.
They have a boxing club here you know, it's pretty cool.
You can practice, compete, and the whole bit.
Really?
Yeah.
Got to get back to work.
Look into it.
Okay.
Hector, come on.
He isn't worth it.
What do you want?
Nothing, I just think you're so cool.
Look, I don't want any trouble.
Trouble, what's this?
Give that back.
Matthew the Mighty, Matthew the Bull.
Dude, you are a trip.
Look, I want it back so just give it.
Hey, you need to relax.
Okay?
Alright?
Just relax.
Did you just try to bite me?
No.
Why don't you pick on someone else, Hector?
Oh look, this guy has new friends.
Yeah, I should have known you would hang out with this wimp.
Oh yeah, well it's better than hanging out with a meathead.
Watch your mouth.
Bird brain.
Hey, don't touch him.
You want to go?
You want to go?
We're going to get in trouble, stop.
Come on let's go, you and me, right now, right now.
Let's do it.
Hey, Nasty Nasher.
Hey Doyle, how was your summer?
Brief.
Okay.
Since nobody wants to tell me what happened you both have detention for a week.
What?
Does that include Hector and Theresa?
I will be talking to them.
This is not a good way to start the year.
I hope it's the last time I see you in my office, do you understand?
Yes, ma'am.
Okay, you go to class, Matthew I want you to stay.
Nick, shut the door please.
Nicholas.
Mr. Doyle.
Look at me, Matthew.
Matthew.
Actions have consequences, Matthew.
Even though it's hard being the new kid you need to try and steer clear of trouble.
We didn't start anything, that guy Hector did, this detention is not fair.
Not everything is fair.
But in the future if you run into trouble call a teacher, don't try and figure it out on your own.
Now go to class, and think about what I said.
So, Matthew, is there something that you would like to tell us?
Yeah, yeah there is.
I am trying out for the boxing team at school.
They have a boxing club, huh?
You know how I feel about boxing.
It is a brutal and pointless sport that leads nowhere.
So, is there something else?
Okay, you know what, I am not hungry.
Sit down, Matthew.
Your principal phoned me today and told me that you have detention for one week?
It's not my fault Mom, this guy was trying to bully me.
He started it and I got blamed.
That's all, I swear.
Well then stay away from him.
Did you get hurt?
No Mom, I didn't get hurt.
Look, I just need you to sign this permission form so I can try out for the team.
What has gotten into you?
What has gotten into me?
You moved me away from all my friends out here to nowheresville, that is what has gotten into me.
Hey, don't raise your voice to your mother like that.
Aw, thanks for your input, Dad.
Matthew, go to your room.
With pleasure.
Come in.
Matthew.
What?
I need you to try and make this work, okay?
I know that it is an adjustment but for me, please.
Mom, I am trying to adjust but you can't just expect it to happen like that.
Listen, Jacob and I have been talking.
So just tell me a little bit more about this boxing thing.
There's nothing really to tell,
I just need your permission.
But honey, you have never really boxed before.
Yeah, but I have always wanted to and there are plenty of fighters who started young.
Mike Tyson won the heavyweight title when he was 20.
That's only five years older than me and Wilfred Benitez, well he was world ranked when he was my age.
And Sugar Ray Leonard, he won before he was 20,
Grandpa won the middleweight
Okay, okay, Matthew, I get it.
We know what Grandpa won.
That is not the point.
Would you just sign it?
Boxing is so dangerous.
You know what could happen, you're not always a winner.
Yeah, but you're always telling me that I am a fighter.
Yeah, I am, and you are.
When you were sick you amazed everybody.
And I want you to be happy, but I cannot stand the thought of you getting sucked into that world.
Mom...
Of you getting hurt.
It's too much for me to handle right now.
Okay?
I just want things to be normal.
It is no kind of life, Matthew.
Mom, you can't blame everything on boxing.
Okay, listen, listen.
Let's just get settled, make some friends, and then do something else.
Do anything else.
Okay.
I will do my best.
I know you will.
Thank you.
I am so relieved.
Mom, good night.
Jab, jab, jab.
Good.
Nice work.
Come on now, cover it up, you're giving him a big target.
That's it.
That's it.
Jab, jab.
Come on guys, let's switch it up a little bit.
Come on, come on.
Nice, get him on the ropes, get him on the ropes.
Good, good, good, good, good.
Cover up, cover up.
Jab, jab, jab, get him in the corner.
Get him in the corner, come on, that's it.
That's it, nice.
Jab, jab, jab, alright, time, good work you guys.
Good work.
Okay, boys bring it over here.
Gentlemen, welcome.
The boxing program at the Aldergrove Secondary School is second to none.
Each year we take a few spots at the national championships for the AIBA.
If you're lucky, one, maybe two of you are going to make this team.
Now, most of these spots are already filled but each weight division needs an alternate just in case the champion in that division can't compete.
So today I am going to choose two contenders for each division.
Now come eight weeks time we're going to have the Aldergrove box-off where those two contenders are going to have a chance to challenge the current champion for that position.
What that means is that it's sink or swim guys, it's gutter time.
Each one of you will be sparring for 30 seconds with one of Aldergrove's top boxers.
Today, some of you will be boxing against Joe Fielder and some of you will be sparring against Hector Torres.
Last year Joe took the light heavyweight title for the 16 and under division and Hector won the State Championship for the middleweight division, all for Aldergrove.
Get in there and get warmed up you guys.
And the rest of you, I want you to line up and put your name and your weight down on this clipboard, let's go.
Hey, where are you going?
I just forgot I had something to do.
I thought you were going to try out.
I, I was but um, that guy Hector really annoys me so I am just going to go.
Well, that's a good thing because you can use that feeling against him in the ring.
Yeah, well, he makes me really nervous.
So what, you don't think Joe Fraser was nervous when he fought Ali?
You think Fraser wasn't afraid of him?
What about Mustard Douglas?
You don't think he's afraid of Iron Mike?
They were, they were like--
No, no, there's no difference.
They were once a couple of nervous kids like you.
So, go on champ.
Go make them nervous.
Okay.
That's it.
Some guys are cheating here, come on guys, let's play fair out there.
Hey, new guy, get in there and impress me.
Nice, nice, nice.
Jab.
Come on, jab jab jab.
That's it, jab, jab.
Jab, jab, jab, good, good, good.
Get the combo on him, Joe, that's it.
That's it.
That's it.
Nice, nice, nice, new guy.
Well done.
Block him Joe, good good good.
Way to break out of there boy.
Take him to the corner, take him to the corner, come on.
That's it, that's it, put him down, put him down.
Good, good.
Okay, that's enough for you, buddy.
Step out.
Good.
Get him in the corner, Hector, get him in the corner, put him down.
That's it, that's it.
Good good.
Good, good, that's it, that's it, nice, nice.
Way to cover new guy, well done.
Nice.
Good, good, finish him off, finish hard, finish hard, time.
Nice work.
Nice work, good stuff.
Miller, Matthew Miller.
Matthew Miller.
Here.
Time to get in the ring, boy.
Let's see what you got.
Okay new guy, 30 seconds to prove yourselves, keep your punches clean and above the belt, alright?
Hey coach, coach, let me tell you this, okay?
Okay you ready?
Hector, you ready?
Alright, let's box.
Alright, come on Hector.
Woah.
Keep it light, Hector.
Time.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I said time.
Cheap shot me, I will kill you.
Over there, Hector.
What's your problem, kid?
I call time, you stop punching.
Get out of my gym, go.
Shake it off, Hector.
You okay, champ?
I made a fool of myself.
Yeah, I saw that.
Yeah?
So then you saw me freak out.
Hey, but you were in there though.
It takes more guts than most people have just to get in the ring.
I didn't expect Hector to be so fast, he threw a lot of punches.
Well, he is fast.
But to your credit you took all those punches.
Yeah, to the face.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Well, Hector and his goons have a lot to laugh about now.
I just wish I could go back to my old school.
You know, from what I saw
I just think you need to keep your form in check and learn to relax.
Yeah, like you know about boxing.
Hey kids, I had dreams of being a heavyweight champion of the world.
Really?
I was climbing up the ranks and everything.
To make a long story short, driving fast and showing off finally caught up with me and put an end to all that, so I know a thing or two about the fighting game.
Well, do you think I could be any good?
It's going to take a lot of practice.
Yeah, well, you're not going to see me in that ring any time soon.
Coach kicked me out.
Thanks anyway.
I am Matthew.
Dan.
Hey, who's that kid with the glasses?
That's me back in the day.
You must have been really good to win that trophy.
Yeah, I was alright.
I am sorry about what happened to you.
Don't be, I am not.
I got married, my wife and I started having kids and I needed to earn a living so it all worked out.
You couldn't make money boxing?
Well, you don't get into boxing to make money.
You get into boxing to be the champ.
You know for every Oscar De La Hoya there are thousands of fighters who never make a dime.
You know, either because they don't have enough talent or they don't have the right management.
And in my case it was just a guy who was living way too fast.
So, aren't you mad?
Nah, not anymore.
You have got to learn to live with it.
Let me tell you something, I still love the sport.
Do you, do you think you could,
I don't know, teach me a boxing move?
Alright, I will show you a jab, that's the most important punch.
Okay.
You come ready, don't you?
Alright.
If you're going to throw a jab you have got to have a stance first so let me see your stance.
Okay, now widen your feet a little bit.
Okay, a little bend in the knees.
Okay.
There you go.
See if I come in and try and push you
I don't want to be able to move you.
See, that's good balance.
If you're too narrow not good.
Okay the jabs the left hand, let me see that jab.
Okay, not bad just throw it straighter, right down the pipe.
There you go.
See this jab is going to keep the other fighter from getting his rhythm, okay?
Okay.
You can use this jab to find your range, okay.
You always want to keep your hands up high, you don't want to drop them down here.
Yeah, yeah, like Tommy Hearns.
Yeah, yeah, but just remember you're not Tommy Hearns.
Okay.
Throw that jab.
Okay.
There you go, straight down the pipe.
There you go, come on, throw that jab.
Alright, lessons over.
Hey, do you think I could maybe come back here after school and you could show me some more stuff then?
Yeah, sure.
Maybe you could even train me.
Well, I don't know about that.
Come on, please Dan, we could just do it in here.
I just want to learn how to box so bad.
Well, let's just put a hold on that for now.
Okay, but I am going to come right back here after sixth period.
Fine.
Thanks Dan.
Jab.
Jab.
1, 2.
1, 2.
1, 2.
Stop.
Will you do me a favour, take the glasses off, see if you can do it without them.
Okay.
Jab.
Jab.
1, 2.
1, 2.
Right hand.
There you go.
Starting to see some natural abilities in there.
Looking good.
My grandfather was a boxer, Charlie Putnam.
Yeah, I knew Charlie.
He was refereeing last time I saw him, good guy.
Jab.
1, 2.
There you go, 1, 2.
1, 2.
Alright.
Uh huh.
See, now if I start throwing punches at you you're right to cover up but you have got to keep your eyes open and look for openings, okay?
Anticipate.
Jab.
1, 2.
Jab.
1, 2.
Alright, you done any running?
I run away a lot.
I will start running to and from school.
Alright, that's good, but you need to add in some roadwork.
I guess.
Do we really have to do eight laps?
Well you do.
I am going to stop here pretty soon.
Maybe I will too.
Hey, if you're going to be a champ you have got to train like a champ.
Oh, and if you can you have got to hold your hands up when you run.
When I used to do my roadwork
I threw punches when I ran.
That's good practice, it's going to help you build up your endurance before a fight.
Okay, I think we should stop soon.
I am getting kind of dizzy.
Yeah.
Well, we almost did four laps.
Yeah, I guess a miles good for the first day.
So, did you know I am a nerd?
Well, the socks kind of gave it away.
Yeah, my Mom has this idea that I am going to be a lawyer or a doctor or some kind of guy that wears a suit.
Can't blame her for that.
Sounds like every Mom.
Yeah, boxing's not really on her list.
She thinks I am going to get hurt or become irresponsible.
And I was really sick as a baby so.
Like serious sick?
Like, leukemia.
But it's okay because I am good now, so it's okay.
I don't know.
Maybe you ought to listen to her.
But if Evander Holyfield came back and beat Mike Tyson after a heart problem and Wayne McCullough has a cyst in his head, he still fights.
Yeah, but kid.
You have got a lot more options than they had.
I guess, I don't know.
You know in boxing there's a lot more going on than the opponent standing in front of you, and there are a lot of elements that go into winning a fight.
Now I think training is important but your mindset, now that's the real key.
It takes a lot of concentration.
Now you have got to block out things inside that ring that don't have anything to do with your opponent.
Yeah, it's like when I am doing trigonometry.
Well, there's a difference between a Math problem and a fight.
Say you're in a fight, okay, now you're dead tired.
Now your body aches.
Now you have got a cut, you have got blood dripping in your eyes.
But you have got to block all of that out and still win the fight.
So, are you going to train me?
Yes.
But it's our secret.
It's going to be one hour a day, Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
Now on the off days you run this track.
Okay.
Eight laps.
Okay.
And don't neglect your studies.
I won't, this school is so easy.
You're going to train me.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Whooo.
Yes, you're going to train me.
Thank you, Dan.
Yes.
Okay, what about this one?
No.
Mom, you said to get whatever I wanted.
Yeah, but you don't have to go along with the crowd.
Fine.
Okay, this, this is the last one.
Oh.
I like that one, that one is good.
Yeah, yeah, okay.
But no jeans that hang low on the bum okay,
I hate those.
So, these are returns, agreed?
Yeah, fine.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hey look at this, I barely even recognized him,
I thought he was Lennox Lewis.
Look at those boxing gloves.
Yeah dude, the freaking janitor,
Dan the muscle man is training him.
How do you know?
I saw them running the track the other day.
My God, that is too funny.
Hey look, I am Matthew.
Ow, ow, it hurts, boxing, ow.
What a freaking loser.
Where are your glasses?
I only really need them for distance.
So, I should stay close then?
Yeah, that would be good.
So, you want to go to the mall?
Yeah, I do but I can't, I have got to be somewhere.
Yeah?
Where?
A secret meeting?
Another life?
Not exactly.
I have got to go for a run.
That's cool, but I hate running.
Yeah well, I am in training right now with a trainer.
That's cool in a Karate Kid kind of way.
Yeah, yeah, it's awesome.
I mean, it's all about self-discipline.
It's not about starting fights, it's about defending yourself.
Too bad Hector doesn't know that,
I mean the guy is such an idiot.
Yeah, you don't have to tell me.
You know, you're not like any girl I have ever met.
Woah, where did that come from?
I don't know.
You're always acting tough and you hang out with guys, not girls.
Yeah well, I am not really like most girls,
I am not exactly the Miley Cyrus type.
Yeah, you're always drawing in that book.
Yeah.
Can I see some of your stuff?
Um, these are just scribbles, I mean.
I won't tell anyone.
Okay, well only if you promise not to laugh.
I don't think I could handle that kind of rejection.
I won't, I swear I won't.
Oh wow.
What do you think?
Ruby, these are, these are really good, not like comic book good but I mean like.
Seriously?
Yeah, you remind me a lot like this artist, Klee.
Who's that?
Paul Klee, he started drawing with like chalk on the sidewalk, you know, graffiti kind of stuff.
But he did some crazy caricatures and I mean, like, you'd love him.
You know, I drew a picture of you.
Really?
Sure, I didn't have anything better to do.
Wow.
That, now that is art.
It's nice, it's very perceptive.
You know, it's so weird, you're such a...
What, a nerd?
A softy.
I can't believe you want to box.
Yeah, well, it's, um, it's in my blood.
Hey.
Time.
Nice, that's good enough for today.
Yeah.
You know, for someone who's never boxed before you catch on pretty quick.
Must be genetics.
Dan, no, I am in the zone, I can tell,
I am going to be good at this.
That's good kid, setting goals is good, it leads to progress.
Speaking of progress I have got to get to work.
Or I will never get out of here tonight.
Do you want me to give you a hand?
I feel like I owe you.
No, no, no.
It does me good to put the pads on anyway.
Besides I am sure you have got better things to do than clean up the girls washroom.
Yeah, maybe.
You know, I am going to call a friend of mine that has a gym, see if we can get you some real sparring time.
Really?
Yeah.
Hey Dan, do you mind if I maybe take these gloves home?
Because I want to practice but the only ones I have are the ones Grandpa gave me when I was 10 and they're like completely worn out.
Yeah, yeah, sure, you have just got to keep this on the down low.
I mean tell your folks and all but you have got to keep this between you and me.
Okay, I understand.
Hey loser.
Come on, Hector.
Leave him alone.
You're going to get me kicked off the cheerleading squad.
Hey loser, are you deaf or something?
That was a pretty good hit you got me with.
Yeah, it was, but it was also a mistake and it cost me a spot on the team so you should be thrilled.
Thrilled?
No, no, see that's why I wanted to talk to you.
See, I told the coach that he should give you another chance.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, I said you hit really hard so he said to find you and tell you to come to the gym today after school because he's giving you and a couple other guys one more shot.
You see, he's not totally satisfied with the roster.
Really?
Yeah.
Is it just today because there's somewhere
I usually go after school?
Sorry, it's only today, man.
Okay, I guess I will see you there.
Alright, see you there.
Is there really a special tryout?
Oh yeah, it's very special.
Hey, where's Coach Harwood?
He will be here in a bit.
Yeah.
He just told us to start sparring first so why don't you put these on.
I was just going to use my gloves.
Oh, these are better.
Okay.
What about headgear?
I don't have any.
I have got some for you.
Here.
Um, who's going to keep time?
I will.
Okay.
Ding ding ding.
Here we go Hector.
So Matthew, why do you hang out with those losers?
They're not losers, they're my friends.
Hey, this guy can really hit.
Maybe he should be on the team.
Hey, ow.
I thought we were just sparring?
Yeah, that's over now, loser.
Ow.
You almost got us in trouble the other day so now you get this.
Ow.
What are you even doing here?
You don't belong at this school, you belong at a school for nerds.
Stop it.
Hey, Hector.
Shut up, this pansy needs to learn his lesson.
You want to box?
Come on.
You want to box?
Come on.
Hey, what are you guys doing?
Nothing, we were just sparring.
It looked like more than sparring to me.
What are you going to do about it anyway?
You're just the janitor so why don't you come in here and mop it up.
What are you going to do about it?
You're right punk, I am the janitor.
You're lucky I don't mop the floor up with you.
Are you threatening me?
It's not a threat, it's a fact.
Now get out of here.
What's going on here?
You tell me.
This kids not part of my program and neither are you.
You better talk to your boy Hector.
I will, get over here Hector.
You stay out of this, Dan.
You okay, kid?
No, I need to lie down.
Come on, let's get you up.
I can't.
I can't get up.
Come on, I will give you a ride home.
Here, look up.
Matthew?
Matthew?
Hey, what happened, baby?
Nothing Mom, everything is fine, just leave me alone right now please.
Is that guy still bothering you?
Mom, stay out of it.
I am going to call the school.
No, Mom, don't do that.
Look at me, Matthew.
Matthew, look at me.
Oh no, this is unacceptable, I am telling the principal.
Mom, it's just a bruise, if you jump in it's not going to make anything better it's going to make everything worse.
I can try to deal with this on my own.
No, I think you have had enough trying it on your own.
I agree with Matthew, I think maybe you and I should hold off before we get involved.
But, look.
He's not a kid, he's a young man.
A lot of people were there, even a teacher saw it okay.
Now I can do this, so just let me.
Okay.
Okay.
I will go make some pizza, from scratch.
Hey Dan.
What do you want?
Mind if I come in?
Free country.
Hey Dan, I have got to talk to you.
So talk.
Can you turn that thing off?
Yeah, I am just finishing up.
You know that kid had no right being in a boxing ring.
Yeah, and your kid had no business doing what he did.
I already spoke to him, he's going to apologize personally and he promises to stay away from your kid.
The kid's name is Matthew.
Swell, he promises to stay away from Matthew.
So, that's it?
Hector beats up a kid for no reason and you just talk to him, he should be suspended.
Quite frankly he should be arrested.
Dan.
You know I am right, but you're not going to let anything happen to him.
Bottom line is Hector Torres is the best fighter this school, this town, has ever had.
He's fighting the toughest league in the state and no one can compete with him, the kid's going to the amateurs.
Oh then he's going to the pros, maybe the Olympics first.
And if you're lucky you will be there to carry his spit bucket.
It's a heck of a lot better than cleaning up after him.
I know what you're doing.
I am doing it too, alright.
We see ourselves in these kids and we push them to be great, the only difference is my kid's got it and your's doesn't.
And if you don't put an end to it he's going to wind up just like you, hurt and defeated.
You know, you may be right about me.
Because when you and I were coming up
I did everything the wrong way.
And I put my ego in front of the sport.
But this kid has something that you and I and Hector don't have.
This kids got heart.
Heart.
Come on Dan.
Look at you, you're out with an injury, me, well let's just say I am better off behind the ropes.
But Hector's got what it takes to go the distance.
Yeah, well I am willing to bet you wrong about Matthew.
I will make you a deal.
What kind of deal?
Let Matthew fight in the box-off, just give him a fair shot.
Let him fight Hector inside the ropes with a ref.
Are you crazy?
I will train him and take full responsibility.
Or I'd be happy to talk to the principal about what happened yesterday.
Maybe he'd like to see Matthew's shiner, maybe he'd like to talk to a few of the witnesses.
You're serious?
Yeah, I am dead serious.
The kids got no style, he can't compete, he's going to get hurt out there.
I believe in him.
Alright, alright, fine.
But you get the parents to sign off on this.
No problem.
Hey Champ, what's up?
Nothing.
Yeah, I was looking for you.
Are you coming by the shop?
Maybe not today.
Missing a day, huh?
That's no way to train, Matthew.
I know, it's just, I just...
Just what?
Hey kid, you hit the mat.
Every champion hits the mat sooner or later, the question is are you going to get back up?
I just don't know if I have what it takes.
You know who Cus D'Amato was?
Yeah sure, he trained Mike Tyson.
So then you know the story about the hero and the coward.
Sort of.
The hero is the hero because he's not afraid and the coward is the coward because he is.
Something like that, but it's not just about being scared.
It's what you do when you feel that way, how you react to your fear, that's what makes you the hero or the coward.
So, what am I?
You tell me.
I am not going to lie to you, Matthew.
There's no guarantees.
Every fight is different, but it's you who determines who you are.
A misfit.
We're all misfits.
But the only person who can stop you from doing something is you.
So, are we going to train or not?
You got a fight coming up.
Wait, what?
I do?
Coach Howard agreed to let you back in the box-offs.
Woah, woah, Dan, how does that work?
Every contender fights Hector Torres.
You are a contender.
Dan, he's going to kill me.
Yeah, maybe, but if you win you're on the team.
Yeah, and if I lose?
You did your best and that's good enough now pick up your books.
That's it.
That's it.
Work, work.
Try to buy time.
Good job.
You're definitely getting faster, Matthew.
Yeah, I have been running like you told me to.
Well good, because against Hector you're going to need to throw punches for three minutes of every round, okay?
You show him you're not afraid, that's going to change everything.
I don't know, Dan.
Do you really think that I have got a shot here?
Kid, this is boxing.
Anything can happen.
I talked to my buddy Avery, he said we could use the gym.
So I will set you up a sparring session.
Yeah?
Yeah, but before that happens you're going to have to get these release forms signed by your parents.
Otherwise you can't compete and I can't take you off campus.
Do you want me to talk to them?
No, no, it's okay.
I have got this.
Okay, good job.
Thanks Dan.
Okay, honey.
We're leaving now.
Okay.
Back around 11.
Yeah sure, have a good night.
See you.
Bye.
Alright, you know what a fighter's greatest asset is?
Power.
No.
What, speed?
No, those two things are important but most of all, and this is what helped Foreman win the title at 40.
45.
45.
What helped him win the title at 45 was just being relaxed in the ring.
The key to being relaxed in the ring is not getting psyched out by what your opponent is trying to do.
Don't worry about him, just fight your fight.
Stick to your game plan.
Okay.
Use that jab and find your range, okay?
Uh-huh.
Step in.
Alright, you guys keep it light.
Ready, let's box.
Come on Matthew, punch.
Time.
Kid, who's your favourite defensive fighter?
Marlon Starling was supposedly pretty good.
Well, as good as he was he still threw a punch from time to time.
So, throw more punches?
Please, keep your hands up, just like we talked about at school.
Ready?
Hands up.
Alright, let's box.
Go to the body, Matthew,
Don't look at me.
You got to do something, Matthew.
You're not going to have any help in there with Hector.
Do something.
Come on Matthew.
Yes.
That a way.
Time.
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Good job.
How do you feel?
I feel good.
You rocked it.
You really rocked it.
Jab.
Jab.
Jab right hand.
Jab right hand.
And the champion of Aldergrove Secondary School is Matthew Miller.
1, 2.
Time.
Looking good, Matthew.
Looking real good.
As good as Hector?
Don't you worry about Hector.
I have to, he's the school champion.
So what?
Sometimes the champion isn't as interesting as the challenger.
I guess.
See that picture there in the middle?
Yeah.
That's me and Coach Howard.
The boxing coach at school?
Yeah.
It's the day we fought the Golden Gloves when we were your age.
Did you win?
Well, I am not the one holding the trophy but I thought I won.
A lot of people thought I won.
Sometimes the judges seems like they see a different fight.
Yeah, that's like when James Toney fought Dave Taberi.
I am not sure I remember that one.
Well, supposedly Taberi won the fight but the judges gave Toney the decision.
Now that fight was in 1992 before I was born and Taberi never fought again.
Can't win them all, that's why you have got to love the sport and not the glory.
Yeah.
Need a ride home?
No, I am just going to bike it home.
Are we looking for a house?
You know, you guys can just let me out and I can find it myself.
You don't need to waste your time.
No, I want to know where you're going, we will pick you up.
Okay.
She said it's number 1042.
Are her parents going to be home?
Probably.
There.
That's it.
Kind of an odd neighbourhood.
She lives here?
Well, maybe her parents work from home.
That's not all that uncommon.
Is that Ruby?
Yup, that's great.
Thanks Jacob.
Bye Mom.
I just want to get out.
No, please don't.
Just pick me up at 11, okay.
Thank you.
Matthew.
Hi.
Are those your parents?
Yeah, something like that.
Come on.
This is so cool.
I wonder how they did that, make movies like this back then.
It took forever,
I mean no one had ever seen anything like this.
Do your parents have a lot of movies?
Yeah.
Hundreds.
Thousands.
Wow, that's really cool.
What do your parents do?
Well, I don't really have a Dad and we lived with my Grandfather.
My Mom is a florist, she had her own shop and everything.
Cool.
She is so pretty.
Well, don't you think she's pretty?
Yeah, you are too.
Shut up.
Do you really think so?
Yeah.
Of course.
You're sweet.
Yo, Adrian.
We did it.
Yo.
Stop it, you're embarrassing me.
I am sorry, just that was awesome.
Sit down.
Never been here with anyone before,
I mean I am usually with my parents.
Yeah well, it's really cool just watching movies here like this, with you.
In our own private drive in and I think I am going to kiss you again.
Has anyone ever told you just to be quiet?
Well, do you think I am weird because I talk so much?
No, I think you're weird because you're weird.
Yes.
I mean, I think we should just kind of hang out.
More of the same.
Hey, loser.
Look, it's the loser and his loser girlfriend, the perfect couple.
Come on, Ruby.
You know what, leave us alone you meathead jock.
Meathead jock.
Didn't Matthew tell you, he's a meathead jock now, we're going to be fighting.
And if he wins which is impossible he's going to be on the team.
Oh, he's going to win.
He's going to kick your butt in front of everybody.
Ruby.
You better tell your girl to watch her mouth or she might get you in trouble.
You know what, back off Hector.
What are you going to do if I don't?
Ahhh.
Don't even think about telling coach about this, okay, because you threw the first punch.
You okay?
Yeah, I am fine.
I hope you destroy that guy.
Yeah, me too.
So, Ruby said that you went over to her place on Saturday?
Actually, we watched that movie from English class at her parents drive in.
You should have called me, I have to watch that movie.
I mean, Mrs. Nasher's making me rewrite my paper because she doesn't think I read it.
Yeah, because you didn't.
I don't know, just go rent it or something.
So, what's going on between you two?
Normal stuff.
What's that mean?
Normal stuff?
Whatever guys and girls do that's normal.
Like kissing?
Yeah, that's normal, right?
Really?
Did you guys like french kiss or--?
Hey guys, what's up?
Hey, we were just talking about kissing you.
Nick.
What?
What did you tell him?
Don't be mad, it was just--
He told me you kissed.
Well, it's none of your pea-brained business.
What else did you say?
Nothing, he asked and I--
Come on, Ruby.
You guys are such losers.
Ruby, wait.
Nick.
Matthew, Matthew, wait, she's just PMSing.
No, she's mad.
No, now is not the time.
Trust me, your life is at risk.
Boring.
But is it Math?
Is it Math?
Looking good.
Looking good.
What is this?
Okay kids please.
Oh thank you thank you, that is wonderful.
You just made my day.
Matthew, can I have a word with you?
Yeah, sure.
You having trouble with the assignments?
No, not really.
Really?
I only ask because you haven't turned in two so far this semester, you missed another one this week.
I am so so sorry Mr. Doyle,
I will make up the assignments I promise.
Okay, good.
Because you know, I am here to help you.
Homework is important, it's worth half your grade.
I know, I just forgot.
Alright, so when are you going to have the assignments in by?
I don't know, soon I guess.
You guess?
It better be soon or I am going to have to call your parents,
I only let students miss two assignments per semester, you're over the limit.
If you don't get good grades you can't sign up for any clubs or teams.
Wait, what if I just did them right now?
Right now?
Yeah, I have got a spare.
I can stay and we can do them right here, if you don't mind.
Sure, right now.
You're just going to do three assignments right now, in your spare.
Just right now.
Sure.
I can do it.
Of course, good idea.
Let's just do three assignments right now, there you go.
3, 2, 6, and 7, is 39...
I was laughing my head off.
Anyway, it wasn't until after that I realized
I had ketchup all over my--
I had ketchup all over my face.
It was like the most embarrassing thing ever.
Hey Dan.
Dan?
Mr. Barns?
Hey Mom.
Matthew.
Jacob, what are you doing home?
Why don't you come in the living room and talk with your mother and me.
What's going on?
Sit down.
Am I in trouble?
Yes.
Is this about my homework or my--
Is it true that you have been boxing at school and that the janitor has been coaching you?
His name is Dan and yeah I have been getting a few pointers.
But we agreed that you would not box.
Your mother was pretty clear how she felt about that.
Okay, why are you even here?
You're not my father.
Matthew, please.
Maybe, it's because my name is on the release form your principal brought with her today.
Apparently Coach Howard has agreed to let Matthew participate in the box-off.
Dan, Mr. Barns, was adamant that he had made it clear to Matthew that he needed to have one of you sign the permission form.
He understood that you had turned it into the office.
I am very sorry about this, with upwards of 700 students we just can't know what they're doing all the time.
We expect our staff to be diligent and we had to let Dan go.
What?
How long has this been going on, Matthew?
This is not Dan's fault, this was my fault, he was just doing me a favour, he was standing up for me.
If he's not there then I quit.
I quit school, I don't care because this is wrong.
Be quiet, Matthew.
No, I will not be quiet.
What has gotten into you?
Mom, I need to do this because I am good at it and I need to be good at something,
I have put so much time and effort--
Yes.
And you lied to us.
Christine.
Hey, Matthew.
Alright, let's all just sit down and listen for a moment.
Mom, nobody thinks that I can make this team but I think I have a shot and Dan thinks I have a shot.
He's given me a chance to do something here, he's like my only friend, he's someone who actually believes in me.
Hey, I am somebody who actually believes in you.
Your mother is somebody who actually believes in you.
No she's not, she always thinks I am going to fail or I am going to get hurt or--
Well, we have been talking here and your mother and I have both agreed to let you fight in the box-offs.
With Dan's help.
No, absolutely not.
But he's my trainer.
Lower your voice, Matthew.
He shouldn't have been your trainer, that's the point.
He was fired because that's not his job and he shouldn't be interfering with students or their activities.
He did his job.
He didn't do anything wrong.
He knows more about boxing than that stupid coach at school.
I am done.
Okay, I am leaving because this is wrong.
This is so wrong.
Matthew.
That will get you there.
Thank you.
Alright.
Mr. Barns.
Hey, Matthew.
Sorry things turned out this way.
I am sorry that I lied about getting my parents permission.
So am I kid.
I can't go back to that school if you're not there.
Don't get carried away kid, life goes on.
I am sorry that you lost your job,
I wasn't trying to get you in trouble.
I agreed to be your trainer Matthew but you had to tell your parents.
That was our deal.
You broke the bond between trainer and fighter.
I know.
I know.
Relax kid, if anybody should be crying it ought to be me.
I am the one that got fired, not you.
So, why aren't you?
You think I wanted to be a janitor for the rest of my life?
Kid, I had dreams just like everybody else.
Lately they haven't seemed to go my way.
The question is what are you going to do?
About what?
Well, you have got a fight coming up.
Dan, I can't do it without you.
Well then what the heck are you doing this for, kid?
It hasn't been for me.
But you're not even going to be there.
Listen, kid.
You're alone anyway.
I am not in the ring with you,
I don't have a pair of gloves on,
I am just there in the corner to guide you along.
You know for three minutes of every round it's just you and your opponent.
Nothing else matters.
For three minutes of every round you get to show everybody exactly what Matthew Miller is made of.
I am scared, Dan.
Hector wants you to feel scared, son.
He's expecting you not to fight.
But you show up win or lose as long as you get in that ring and do your best, you fight that fear, you win no matter what.
You think I can beat Hector?
It doesn't matter what I think, it matters what you think.
Now get out of here.
Morning.
Morning.
Oh, you should have come down quicker, it's probably all mushy by now.
Mom, it's fine.
I don't know if I can do this honey.
I mean I went once when I was a little girl to watch Dad and I,
I threw up, I just threw up when I saw Dad getting hit and all the blood and oh dear.
We don't have to go Christine.
Mom, it's fine.
Whatever you decide, it's okay.
Now, I am going to go run a couple laps before first period.
Okay, I love you.
Bye, bye Jacob.
Love you.
Okay.
Hey Matthew.
Hey.
It's the big day.
Should we reserve a hospital bed for you?
Shut up, Nick.
Come on, I am just joking.
You know, ease up the tension.
I hate boxing, I mean I hate sports, but I am coming to watch you so if you win--
When he wins.
When you win just don't become a dumb jock, okay?
Come on, I won't.
Okay, well see you two.
Hey.
Hey.
How you been?
I have missed you.
I have missed you too okay, I am sorry that I blabbed.
Hey, I totally overreacted.
I drew you.
You winning the boxing match.
Wow.
Ruby, that's just how I imagined it.
I am not quite done though.
I think I am going to add Hector somewhere in there, maybe on the floor, knocked out.
You know, I think I like it the way it is.
Just me.
Well, Mr. Confident.
I should probably be getting to class, but I will see you later.
Oh yeah.
And, Matthew?
Yeah?
Good luck in the ring.
Look who showed up.
So, who's working your corner, Matthew?
He's so scared.
He can't talk.
Is that true?
Are you so scared you can't even speak?
No Hector.
I am just too busy thinking about how stupid you sound when you open your mouth.
Oh-ho-ho.
And Joe, you smell like a dumpster, when was the last time you showered?
Now is your chance to laugh it up dork, because once we get in the ring one things for sure.
You're going to die.
Nice comeback, champ.
Dan.
How you doing, kid?
I am good.
I am nervous.
You should be nervous.
Five minutes, boys.
I just came to wish you good luck.
Thanks.
I just want you to block everything out and do what you have been taught to do.
I will do my best.
Just remember, Hectors just as nervous as you are.
See you out there.
:
Please welcome our own Aldergrove boxing team, and Contenders.
Hey guys, how's it going?
You feel good?
Alright, first up, get your gear on.
First up, get your gear on.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to welcome you to the 10th annual
Aldergrove Secondary School Box-off.
Today we will be watching our current and present champions all competing against new challengers who will all be fighting for their positions on the team.
We will be having fights with five of the traditional eight weight categories that boxing has to offer, and each challenger will have three rounds lasting three minutes each to secure their spots.
Let's box.
Hey, long time no see.
Dad.
What are you doing here?
Your husband called me, I appreciate it sir.
Well, I knew he was going to be pleased, this is a huge day for him.
Glad to be here.
Hit him on the inside.
Follow it up.
Good job.
Let's hear it for our heavyweight contenders.
And now in our light heavyweight class please welcome our State champion in the 1600 division,
Joe Fielde.
Come on Joe.
Come over here guys, come on.
I know you both know the rules, alright.
I want a clean fight, you got three rounds to make this team?
Any questions?
Alright, let's touch gloves, have a good fight.
Fight.
Come on Joe, you have got to hit him one time.
Yes.
Yes.
What?
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...
Everybody's afraid, Matthew, but how you react to that fear is what makes you the hero or the coward.
...9
Hey, you ready?
You ready?
Yeah, yes.
Let's see what you got.
Okay.
Come on, Matt.
Go Matthew.
Come on, Matthew.
You can do it, come on.
:
You don't think Joe Fraser was nervous before he fought Ali?
Now, in the middleweight division our final contender and challenger, Matthew Miller.
And defending in this division, our state champion, Hector Torres.
Come over here, Hector.
Come on Hector, just do it.
Hey Miller.
You fight that fear and you will win, no matter what.
Snap out of it.
Alright, remember, you have got three rounds, three minutes each.
No low blows, no rabbit punches, in case of a knock down
I want you to go to the neutral corner.
Alright.
If that ref says break,
I want you to break clean, any questions?
No one's in your corner, pansy.
Hey, take it easy Hector.
Whatever you say, coach.
Let's have a good fight.
Ready?
Ready?
Fight.
Hector wants you to be afraid, Matthew, he wants you to give up.
Hands up, Matthew, hands up.
Good job, Hector.
Oh my God.
I can't.
Okay, step back, come on, fight.
Don't worry about what Hector's doing, just fight your fight.
Nice.
Jab, Matthew, jab.
Alright, over to the corner.
Keep it clean.
There's no one looking after that boy.
Start playing by the rules buddy, look at me when I am talking to you.
How am I supposed to back you up if you're not playing by the rules, huh?
Don't blow this for yourself.
Here.
Now, sit sit sit.
Grandpa?
Here's some water, reach out your mouth.
What are you doing here?
Your new father called me, don't worry, it's all good.
Yeah.
Is Mom okay?
Just concentrate on the match.
You don't think about anything else.
That last round was good, but you have got to throw some more punches.
Yeah, I know, I am counting.
Counting what?
Well, he throws six punches and then he breaks and that's when I have got to hit him.
That's a good observation.
But you have got to keep your hands up but don't lose sight of him, don't hide.
Come out with your hands nice and loose.
The last round you have got him good.
He got me, is there a lot of blood?
Nah, it's not much.
He fights like a baby.
Come on.
Go Matthew.
Take control.
If you're going to win this fight you have to block everything out.
Over there, over there.
Come on.
Come on, Matthew.
Keep your chin down, Matthew, eyes up.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
Yeah, that's right.
It's all me.
How you doing, son?
You had enough?
No.
He popped you good there, getting through those gloves.
There you go, cool you down.
Kid, how are you?
Dan.
You're doing great, keep working the body though, okay?
You find those ribs and you keep working those ribs, you pound him.
Three minutes to go in this fight.
Okay, you hear me?
The guy behind me he's getting sloppy and he's getting tired.
You see that, he's getting sloppy and tired.
Okay, this is your round, this is your round.
Okay?
Give me everything you got.
I will, I promise.
All in the ring.
I promise.
Oh, he's a baby.
After him.
Come on, Matthew.
Come on.
Concentrate, Matthew.
Come on, Matthew.
You can do it, come on.
Stay in the moment, Matthew.
Nothing else matters.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...
Yeah buddy, yeah.
Alright, let me see your gloves.
Fight.
Come on, Matthew.
Come on Matthew, come on.
This is your chance, Matthew, show the world exactly what you're made of.
Whooo.
Go Matthew.
Get over there and do the right thing, son.
Go on.
Hey, that was a good match, you hit pretty hard.
Yeah, you too.
So, after three great rounds of action the judges tally is in.
And the score is 2 rounds to 1, for the current middleweight champion of Aldergrove Secondary School, Hector Torres.
I think he did alright.
Yeah.
It's alright, Matt.
Way to go.
What?
I lost.
But you lasted three rounds kid, you showed the heart of a champion.
You're a winner to me all the way, son.
But I lost.
Yeah, that's how you do it.
I am taking Aldergrove Secondary to the top, we're going to be the best in the whole league.
Yeah.
Let's go.
I just want you all to know what a great discovery
I think Matthew Miller is, and I definitely think there's room for him as an alternate in the middleweight division for the Aldergrove Boxing Team, what do you say?
After all, Hector graduates this year and we're going to need someone to win some championships for Aldergrove, how about that?
I want to be on the team, I want to be on the team.
Come on up here and say a couple words.
Thank you coach.
Well, I just wanted to thank my parents for always telling me that I am a fighter.
My best friends Nick and Ruby for never letting me fight alone.
My grandpa for being in my corner and finally my coach, Dan Barns for telling me that I could be a champ.
Alright, thanks again everyone for coming out and supporting the Aldergrove Boxing Team.
Good job, kid.
We couldn't do it without you, looking forward to another successful season, see you all at the first fight.
So, you going to stick around?
No, I am going to get moving kid.
I have got some dreams I want to chase.
These are yours, so.
No, no, hang on to them, they look good on you, okay?
Okay.
Listen, I will see you down the road, alright.
It's been a pleasure.
Thanks coach, happy trails.
Hey.
You were amazing.
You totally surprised me.
I surprised myself.
You were transformed.
Not completely.
Mom.
Matthew.
You were so brave.
So ridiculously brave.
Did you actually see me or were you watching through your fingers?
No, I kept my eyes open for the most part,
I am a big girl now.
Alright, picture time, get in close in, guys.
Alright.
Well, look at that, three generations.
Alright.
Is this Ruby?
Yeah, that's Ruby.
Well get in there, dear.
There we go.
Where's Dan the man?
He left.
He's gone?
Like, really gone?
Yeah, like totally gone.
You're okay with that?
Yeah, I am okay.
Just shows you Matt, a good coach makes all the difference.
There we go.
I will take it, you get in there.

Matthew, stop it.
Stop it, Matthew.
Matthew.
What?
The nails, stop biting your nails.
Look at this place.
Who lives here?
Who would want to live here?
It's nowhere.
Look, I know this can't be easy for you.
New school, new town.
New house and a big new daddy.
Hey, that's not fair, Matt.
Jacob is the best thing that's happened to me in forever.
So, I am sorry that we had to pull you out of private school.
I had a scholarship.
Yes, I know, and it helped.
But we are maxed out.
Look, I need you to pitch in, okay?
That's the way it is and public school is part of it.
Mom, I had a life, I had friends.
Nobody I know has even heard of this school.
You're going to make new friends.
Mom, you have no idea what it's like to be the new kid.
I might as well have a kick me sign on my back.
Oh honey, you're being a little dramatic.
You're smart, you will adapt.
Very few kids have been through what you have been through.
You're a fighter, huh?
And you're going to do just fine.
No, I am going to hate this school and I know it.
See, honey?
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Want me to come in with you?
No, mom.
It's okay, I have got this.
Can I have a kiss goodbye?
No.
I am not a baby anymore, mom.
Thanks for the ride.
Okay, well you have a great day, and you are still my baby.
Mom.
(P.A.):
Good morning students, welcome back to Aldergrove Secondary.
Schedules are now available in the office.
Please collect them and make your way to home room and classes will begin promptly in 10 minutes.
Have a great day, make this the start of a great year.
Because you're in high school now you can expect to do more homework without anyone reminding you and more reading.
Here's the reading list, it's long, and a breakdown of the assignments.
(Class):
Aww.
Alright, calm down.
It isn't going to be that bad.
But you won't be able to float through this course.
Hi.
Hello.
I am Matthew Miller, I think I am in this class.
Yeah, and I think you're late, Point Dexter.
Go to the office.
[laughter]
Mr. Worthlin, that is not how we treat new students.
You can work on your manners in detention.
Find a seat, Matthew.
Come on, I was kidding.
This guys my friend, we were just kidding around, right bro?
Yeah, we're friends.
It was a joke.
Yeah, see?
That doesn't make any difference to me.
I expect a certain standard of behaviour in my class.
Our first book of this year will be Metropolis which was made into a movie which remains an icon on film making.
This novel came first however, and it explores the themes of class struggle and genetic manipulation.
I want you to write a paper exploring these issues presented almost 100 years ago and how they have changed or not changed since then.
First day of school, I get detention.
What's up with that?
Hey, thanks for helping me out, man.
Yeah well, I didn't help much.
Yeah, well, still.
You tuned in real quick.
I am Nick.
I am Matthew.
So, what's it like to be the new kid?
It sucks.
Yeah, well, just make sure you report to the lunch room at 1:00 p.m. for the new kid beat down.
Wait, what?
Dude, I am joking.
Lighten up man.
Real funny.
Oh, and Mateo, lose the suit man, you're just asking for it.
Thanks.
Hey.
Hey, how's it going?
Fine.
Yeah, well I am really happy to see you getting your room together.
Can I use sticky tac?
Yeah, sure, yeah.
Whatever you want.
It's your room.
Just no open fires.
Here let me help you with that.
No, it's fine, I got it.
Okay.
He's cool, who's that?
My grandfather.
Really?
That's your mom's dad?
Yeah.
Your mom told me he was a car salesman.
He is, but before that he was a fighter and then a referee.
He does live in Florida though, right?
Yeah.
Huh.
I need to do some homework.
Now.
Yeah yeah, sure sure.
Alright, well, if you need any help
I will be right out there.
Yeah.
[cheers]
Look at those pom poms.
See you at the sock hop.
What's up, Point Dexter?
Nothing.
Are you Matthew?
Hi, I am Ruby.
You want to eat with us?
I am okay.
Oh, come on, dude.
Eat with us.
We won't bite.
Well, I might.
Oh, Point Dexter tried to save me from detention in Mrs. Nasher's class yesterday.
How noble of him.
Yeah.
Sit down, dude.
Um, okay.
So, you want to join our crew?
What crew?
The Ghetto Crew.
We're the coolest non-club in school.
What's a non-club?
We're like the anti-club.
We're cooler than clubs.
Oh, so like an exclusive club.
You know it, and our goal is epic world domination.
Yeah, we're taking it back from all those jocks and stuck up losers.
Okay.
I like it, so what do I have to do?
Nothing.
That's the beauty of it.
Absolutely nothing.
Except, you got to go up to that girl Theresa, the tall one with the big smile, and ask her for a date.
What?
Don't do it, Point Dexter.
I am not very, really...
This is important, he has to do it if he wants to get in the crew.
He can do it if he wants to get his face punched.
Yeah, I...
Are you going to do it or not?
Okay, you know what, sure.
I will do it.
Perfect, show us your skills.
Yeah, okay.
Hi Theresa.
Did you say my name?
Yeah, hi, I am Matthew, I am the new kid here and I am just kind of wondering if you ever wanted to maybe consider ever hanging out or going out or something sometime.
Whatever.
Okay, it was very nice to meet you Theresa.
This guy bugging you, Theresa?
No.
Were you checking out my girlfriend?
No, I was just--
What are you staring at your big ugly shoes for?
I am talking to you, look at me.
I was just, I-
- I--
Is this kid stupid or something?
I am sorry.
Oh I am sorry.
Sorry didn't do it, you did.
Ahhh.
Hector.
What?
Are you crying?
No, I am not crying.
Alright, this wimps going to get us in trouble.
Come on, let's eat.
Look, I am watching you, loser.
[bell ringing]
Hey, you okay?
I am fine, I am not crying.
Yeah, sure.
Where's your next class?
It's Math, it's room 129.
That's right next to my room, I will walk with you.
(Ruby):
Are you okay?
What happened?
[knocking]
How's it going?
It's fine.
You like books, huh?
Some of them.
Here.
I found that at a book store on my lunch break,
I thought you might like it.
Jacob, thank you.
This is, this is Muhammed Ali standing over Sonny Liston, it's what they call a phantom punch.
They say that Ali knocked him out with a punch nobody even saw.
Yeah, yeah.
My Dad told me about that fight.
That must have been something, huh?
Yeah.
[light knock]
Hey guys, I made a cake.
Chocolate.
Fight you for the last piece.
Yeah, yeah.
Come on.
I will phantom punch you.
Stop right here.
Okay.
You don't need to pick me up after school because I think I am going to walk home.
Have a good day.
Yup, thanks Mom.
Check out this guy right here, look at him.
Who said that you could use the front door, geek?
I just-
- I just--
I-
- I-
- What are you, Rain Man?
Speak up, punk?
Let me go.
Excuse me.
Is that your trash?
Is that yours?
No, it's this punks right here.
Hey, you wouldn't lie to me, would you?
It's not mine, so.
Really.
But you will clean it up, right?
Yes sir.
Thank you.
You boys can go to class.
What's the janitor going to do?
Mop me up?
Thanks.
Yeah, no need.
It's my job to clean up the trash around here.
So, you like boxing?
Yeah, I love it.
Do you box?
No.
What's so funny?
It's nothing.
They have a boxing club here you know, it's pretty cool.
You can practice, compete, and the whole bit.
Really?
Yeah.
Got to get back to work.
Look into it.
Okay.
[cheers]
Hector, come on.
He isn't worth it.
What do you want?
Nothing, I just think you're so cool.
Look, I don't want any trouble.
Trouble, what's this?
Give that back.
Matthew the Mighty, Matthew the Bull.
Dude, you are a trip.
Look, I want it back so just give it.
Hey, you need to relax.
Okay?
Alright?
Just relax.
Did you just try to bite me?
No.
Why don't you pick on someone else, Hector?
Oh look, this guy has new friends.
Yeah, I should have known you would hang out with this wimp.
Oh yeah, well it's better than hanging out with a meathead.
Watch your mouth.
Bird brain.
Hey, don't touch him.
You want to go?
You want to go?
We're going to get in trouble, stop.
Come on let's go, you and me, right now, right now.
let's do it.
[telephone ringing]
Hey, Nasty Nasher.
Hey Doyle, how was your summer?
Brief.
Okay.
Since nobody wants to tell me what happened you both have detention for a week.
What?
Does that include Hector and Theresa?
I will be talking to them.
This is not a good way to start the year.
I hope it's the last time I see you in my office, do you understand?
Yes, ma'am.
Okay, you go to class, Matthew I want you to stay.
Nick, shut the door please.
Nicholas.
Mr. Doyle.
Look at me, Matthew.
Matthew.
Actions have consequences, Matthew.
Even though it's hard being the new kid you need to try and steer clear of trouble.
We didn't start anything, that guy Hector did, this detention is not fair.
Not everything is fair.
But in the future if you run into trouble call a teacher, don't try and figure it out on your own.
Now go to class, and think about what I said.
So, Matthew, is there something that you would like to tell us?
Yeah, yeah there is.
I am trying out for the boxing team at school.
They have a boxing club, huh?
You know how I feel about boxing.
It is a brutal and pointless sport that leads nowhere.
So, is there something else?
Okay, you know what, I am not hungry.
Sit down, Matthew.
Your principal phoned me today and told me that you have detention for one week?
It's not my fault Mom, this guy was trying to bully me.
He started it and I got blamed.
That's all, I swear.
Well then stay away from him.
Did you get hurt?
No Mom, I didn't get hurt.
Look, I just need you to sign this permission form so I can try out for the team.
What has gotten into you?
What has gotten into me?
You moved me away from all my friends out here to nowheresville, that is what has gotten into me.
Hey, don't raise your voice to your mother like that.
Aw, thanks for your input, Dad.
Matthew, go to your room.
With pleasure.
[light knock]
Come in.
Matthew.
What?
I need you to try and make this work, okay?
I know that it is an adjustment but for me, please.
Mom, I am trying to adjust but you can't just expect it to happen like that.
Listen, Jacob and I have been talking.
So just tell me a little bit more about this boxing thing.
There's nothing really to tell,
I just need your permission.
But honey, you have never really boxed before.
Yeah, but I have always wanted to and there are plenty of fighters who started young.
Mike Tyson won the heavyweight title when he was 20.
That's only five years older than me and Wilfred Benitez, well he was world ranked when he was my age.
And Sugar Ray Leonard, he won before he was 20,
Grandpa won the middleweight
Okay, okay, Matthew, I get it.
We know what Grandpa won.
That is not the point.
Would you just sign it?
Boxing is so dangerous.
You know what could happen, you're not always a winner.
Yeah, but you're always telling me that I am a fighter.
Yeah, I am, and you are.
When you were sick you amazed everybody.
And I want you to be happy, but I cannot stand the thought of you getting sucked into that world.
Mom...
Of you getting hurt.
It's too much for me to handle right now.
Okay?
I just want things to be normal.
It is no kind of life, Matthew.
Mom, you can't blame everything on boxing.
Okay, listen, listen.
Let's just get settled, make some friends, and then do something else.
Do anything else.
Okay.
I will do my best.
I know you will.
Thank you.
I am so relieved.
Mom, good night.
Jab, jab, jab.
Good.
Nice work.
Come on now, cover it up, you're giving him a big target.
That's it.
That's it.
Jab, jab.
Come on guys, let's switch it up a little bit.
Come on, come on.
Nice, get him on the ropes, get him on the ropes.
Good, good, good, good, good.
Cover up, cover up.
Jab, jab, jab, get him in the corner.
Get him in the corner, come on, that's it.
That's it, nice.
Jab, jab, jab, alright, time, good work you guys.
Good work.
[whistle]
Okay, boys bring it over here.
Gentlemen, welcome.
The boxing program at the Aldergrove Secondary School is second to none.
Each year we take a few spots at the national championships for the AIBA.
If you're lucky, one, maybe two of you are going to make this team.
Now, most of these spots are already filled but each weight division needs an alternate just in case the champion in that division can't compete.
So today I am going to choose two contenders for each division.
Now come eight weeks time we're going to have the Aldergrove box-off where those two contenders are going to have a chance to challenge the current champion for that position.
What that means is that it's sink or swim guys, it's gutter time.
Each one of you will be sparring for 30 seconds with one of Aldergrove's top boxers.
Today, some of you will be boxing against Joe Fielder and some of you will be sparring against Hector Torres.
Last year Joe took the light heavyweight title for the 16 and under division and Hector won the State Championship for the middleweight division, all for Aldergrove.
Get in there and get warmed up you guys.
And the rest of you, I want you to line up and put your name and your weight down on this clipboard, let's go.
Hey, where are you going?
I just forgot I had something to do.
I thought you were going to try out.
I, I was but um, that guy Hector really annoys me so I am just going to go.
Well, that's a good thing because you can use that feeling against him in the ring.
Yeah, well, he makes me really nervous.
So what, you don't think Joe Fraser was nervous when he fought Ali?
You think Fraser wasn't afraid of him?
What about Mustard Douglas?
You don't think he's afraid of Iron Mike?
They were, they were like--
No, no, there's no difference.
They were once a couple of nervous kids like you.
So, go on champ.
Go make them nervous.
Okay.
That's it.
Some guys are cheating here, come on guys, let's play fair out there.
Hey, new guy, get in there and impress me.
Nice, nice, nice.
Jab.
Come on, jab jab jab.
That's it, jab, jab.
Jab, jab, jab, good, good, good.
Get the combo on him, Joe, that's it.
That's it.
That's it.
Nice, nice, nice, new guy.
Well done.
Block him Joe, good good good.
Way to break out of there boy.
Take him to the corner, take him to the corner, come on.
That's it, that's it, put him down, put him down.
Good, good.
Okay, that's enough for you, buddy.
Step out.
Good.
Get him in the corner, Hector, get him in the corner, put him down.
That's it, that's it.
Good good.
Good, good, that's it, that's it, nice, nice.
Way to cover new guy, well done.
Nice.
Good, good, finish him off, finish hard, finish hard, time.
Nice work.
Nice work, good stuff.
Miller, Matthew Miller.
Matthew Miller.
Here.
Time to get in the ring, boy.
let's see what you got.
Okay new guy, 30 seconds to prove yourselves, keep your punches clean and above the belt, alright?
Hey coach, coach, let me tell you this, okay?
Okay you ready?
Hector, you ready?
Alright, let's box.
Alright, come on Hector.
Woah.
Keep it light, Hector.
Time.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I said time.
Cheap shot me, I will kill you.
Over there, Hector.
What's your problem, kid?
I call time, you stop punching.
Get out of my gym, go.
Shake it off, Hector.
You okay, champ?
I made a fool of myself.
Yeah, I saw that.
Yeah?
So then you saw me freak out.
Hey, but you were in there though.
It takes more guts than most people have just to get in the ring.
I didn't expect Hector to be so fast, he threw a lot of punches.
Well, he is fast.
But to your credit you took all those punches.
Yeah, to the face.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Well, Hector and his goons have a lot to laugh about now.
I just wish I could go back to my old school.
You know, from what I saw
I just think you need to keep your form in check and learn to relax.
Yeah, like you know about boxing.
Hey kids, I had dreams of being a heavyweight champion of the world.
Really?
I was climbing up the ranks and everything.
To make a long story short, driving fast and showing off finally caught up with me and put an end to all that, so I know a thing or two about the fighting game.
Well, do you think I could be any good?
It's going to take a lot of practice.
Yeah, well, you're not going to see me in that ring any time soon.
Coach kicked me out.
Thanks anyway.
I am Matthew.
Dan.
Hey, who's that kid with the glasses?
That's me back in the day.
You must have been really good to win that trophy.
Yeah, I was alright.
I am sorry about what happened to you.
Don't be, I am not.
I got married, my wife and I started having kids and I needed to earn a living so it all worked out.
You couldn't make money boxing?
Well, you don't get into boxing to make money.
You get into boxing to be the champ.
You know for every Oscar De La Hoya there are thousands of fighters who never make a dime.
You know, either because they don't have enough talent or they don't have the right management.
And in my case it was just a guy who was living way too fast.
So, aren't you mad?
Nah, not anymore.
You have got to learn to live with it.
Let me tell you something, I still love the sport.
Do you, do you think you could,
I don't know, teach me a boxing move?
Alright, I will show you a jab, that's the most important punch.
Okay.
You come ready, don't you?
Alright.
If you're going to throw a jab you have got to have a stance first so let me see your stance.
Okay, now widen your feet a little bit.
Okay, a little bend in the knees.
Okay.
There you go.
See if I come in and try and push you
I don't want to be able to move you.
See, that's good balance.
If you're too narrow not good.
Okay the jabs the left hand, let me see that jab.
Okay, not bad just throw it straighter, right down the pipe.
There you go.
See this jab is going to keep the other fighter from getting his rhythm, okay?
Okay.
You can use this jab to find your range, okay.
You always want to keep your hands up high, you don't want to drop them down here.
Yeah, yeah, like Tommy Hearns.
Yeah, yeah, but just remember you're not Tommy Hearns.
Okay.
Throw that jab.
Okay.
There you go, straight down the pipe.
There you go, come on, throw that jab.
[bell ringing]
Alright, lessons over.
Hey, do you think I could maybe come back here after school and you could show me some more stuff then?
Yeah, sure.
Maybe you could even train me.
Well, I don't know about that.
Come on, please Dan, we could just do it in here.
I just want to learn how to box so bad.
Well, let's just put a hold on that for now.
Okay, but I am going to come right back here after sixth period.
Fine.
Thanks Dan.
Jab.
Jab.
1, 2.
1, 2.
1, 2.
Stop.
Will you do me a favour, take the glasses off, see if you can do it without them.
Okay.
Jab.
Jab.
1, 2.
1, 2.
Right hand.
There you go.
Starting to see some natural abilities in there.
Looking good.
My grandfather was a boxer, Charlie Putnam.
Yeah, I knew Charlie.
He was refereeing last time I saw him, good guy.
Jab.
1, 2.
There you go, 1, 2.
1, 2.
Alright.
Uh huh.
See, now if I start throwing punches at you you're right to cover up but you have got to keep your eyes open and look for openings, okay?
Anticipate.
Jab.
1, 2.
Jab.
1, 2.
Alright, you done any running?
I run away a lot.
[chuckles]
I will start running to and from school.
Alright, that's good, but you need to add in some roadwork.
I guess.
Do we really have to do eight laps?
Well you do.
I am going to stop here pretty soon.
Maybe I will too.
Hey, if you're going to be a champ you have got to train like a champ.
Oh, and if you can you have got to hold your hands up when you run.
When I used to do my roadwork
I threw punches when I ran.
That's good practice, it's going to help you build up your endurance before a fight.
Okay, I think we should stop soon.
I am getting kind of dizzy.
Yeah.
Well, we almost did four laps.
Yeah, I guess a miles good for the first day.
So, did you know I am a nerd?
Well, the socks kind of gave it away.
Yeah, my Mom has this idea that I am going to be a lawyer or a doctor or some kind of guy that wears a suit.
Can't blame her for that.
Sounds like every Mom.
Yeah, boxing's not really on her list.
She thinks I am going to get hurt or become irresponsible.
And I was really sick as a baby so.
Like serious sick?
Like, leukemia.
But it's okay because I am good now, so it's okay.
I don't know.
Maybe you ought to listen to her.
But if Evander Holyfield came back and beat Mike Tyson after a heart problem and Wayne McCullough has a cyst in his head, he still fights.
Yeah, but kid.
You have got a lot more options than they had.
I guess, I don't know.
You know in boxing there's a lot more going on than the opponent standing in front of you, and there are a lot of elements that go into winning a fight.
Now I think training is important but your mindset, now that's the real key.
It takes a lot of concentration.
Now you have got to block out things inside that ring that don't have anything to do with your opponent.
Yeah, it's like when I am doing trigonometry.
Well, there's a difference between a Math problem and a fight.
Say you're in a fight, okay, now you're dead tired.
Now your body aches.
Now you have got a cut, you have got blood dripping in your eyes.
But you have got to block all of that out and still win the fight.
So, are you going to train me?
Yes.
But it's our secret.
It's going to be one hour a day, Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
Now on the off days you run this track.
Okay.
Eight laps.
Okay.
And don't neglect your studies.
I won't, this school is so easy.
You're going to train me.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Whooo.
Yes, you're going to train me.
Thank you, Dan.
Yes.
Okay, what about this one?
No.
Mom, you said to get whatever I wanted.
Yeah, but you don't have to go along with the crowd.
Fine.
Okay, this, this is the last one.
Oh.
I like that one, that one is good.
Yeah, yeah, okay.
But no jeans that hang low on the bum okay,
I hate those.
So, these are returns, agreed?
Yeah, fine.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hey look at this, I barely even recognized him,
I thought he was Lennox Lewis.
Look at those boxing gloves.
Yeah dude, the freaking janitor,
Dan the muscle man is training him.
How do you know?
I saw them running the track the other day.
My God, that is too funny.
Hey look, I am Matthew.
Ow, ow, it hurts, boxing, ow.
What a freaking loser.
Where are your glasses?
I only really need them for distance.
So, I should stay close then?
Yeah, that would be good.
So, you want to go to the mall?
Yeah, I do but I can't, I have got to be somewhere.
Yeah?
Where?
A secret meeting?
Another life?
Not exactly.
I have got to go for a run.
That's cool, but I hate running.
Yeah well, I am in training right now with a trainer.
That's cool in a Karate Kid kind of way.
Yeah, yeah, it's awesome.
I mean, it's all about self-discipline.
It's not about starting fights, it's about defending yourself.
Too bad Hector doesn't know that,
I mean the guy is such an idiot.
Yeah, you don't have to tell me.
You know, you're not like any girl I have ever met.
Woah, where did that come from?
I don't know.
You're always acting tough and you hang out with guys, not girls.
Yeah well, I am not really like most girls,
I am not exactly the Miley Cyrus type.
Yeah, you're always drawing in that book.
Yeah.
Can I see some of your stuff?
Um, these are just scribbles, I mean.
I won't tell anyone.
Okay, well only if you promise not to laugh.
I don't think I could handle that kind of rejection.
I won't, I swear I won't.
Oh wow.
What do you think?
Ruby, these are, these are really good, not like comic book good but I mean like.
Seriously?
Yeah, you remind me a lot like this artist, Klee.
Who's that?
Paul Klee, he started drawing with like chalk on the sidewalk, you know, graffiti kind of stuff.
But he did some crazy caricatures and I mean, like, you'd love him.
You know, I drew a picture of you.
Really?
Sure, I didn't have anything better to do.
Wow.
That, now that is art.
It's nice, it's very perceptive.
You know, it's so weird, you're such a...
What, a nerd?
A softy.
I can't believe you want to box.
Yeah, well, it's, um, it's in my blood.
Hey.
Time.
Nice, that's good enough for today.
Yeah.
You know, for someone who's never boxed before you catch on pretty quick.
Must be genetics.
Dan, no, I am in the zone, I can tell,
I am going to be good at this.
That's good kid, setting goals is good, it leads to progress.
Speaking of progress I have got to get to work.
Or I will never get out of here tonight.
Do you want me to give you a hand?
I feel like I owe you.
No, no, no.
It does me good to put the pads on anyway.
Besides I am sure you have got better things to do than clean up the girls washroom.
Yeah, maybe.
You know, I am going to call a friend of mine that has a gym, see if we can get you some real sparring time.
Really?
Yeah.
Hey Dan, do you mind if I maybe take these gloves home?
Because I want to practice but the only ones I have are the ones Grandpa gave me when I was 10 and they're like completely worn out.
Yeah, yeah, sure, you have just got to keep this on the down low.
I mean tell your folks and all but you have got to keep this between you and me.
Okay, I understand.
Hey loser.
Come on, Hector.
Leave him alone.
You're going to get me kicked off the cheerleading squad.
Hey loser, are you deaf or something?
That was a pretty good hit you got me with.
Yeah, it was, but it was also a mistake and it cost me a spot on the team so you should be thrilled.
Thrilled?
No, no, see that's why I wanted to talk to you.
See, I told the coach that he should give you another chance.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, I said you hit really hard so he said to find you and tell you to come to the gym today after school because he's giving you and a couple other guys one more shot.
You see, he's not totally satisfied with the roster.
Really?
Yeah.
Is it just today because there's somewhere
I usually go after school?
Sorry, it's only today, man.
Okay, I guess I will see you there.
Alright, see you there.
Is there really a special tryout?
Oh yeah, it's very special.
Hey, where's Coach Harwood?
He will be here in a bit.
Yeah.
He just told us to start sparring first so why don't you put these on.
I was just going to use my gloves.
Oh, these are better.
Okay.
What about headgear?
I don't have any.
I have got some for you.
Here.
Um, who's going to keep time?
I will.
Okay.
Ding ding ding.
Here we go Hector.
So Matthew, why do you hang out with those losers?
They're not losers, they're my friends.
Hey, this guy can really hit.
Maybe he should be on the team.
Hey, ow.
I thought we were just sparring?
Yeah, that's over now, loser.
Ow.
You almost got us in trouble the other day so now you get this.
Ow.
What are you even doing here?
You don't belong at this school, you belong at a school for nerds.
Stop it.
Hey, Hector.
Shut up, this pansy needs to learn his lesson.
You want to box?
Come on.
You want to box?
Come on.
Hey, what are you guys doing?
Nothing, we were just sparring.
It looked like more than sparring to me.
What are you going to do about it anyway?
You're just the janitor so why don't you come in here and mop it up.
What are you going to do about it?
You're right punk, I am the janitor.
You're lucky I don't mop the floor up with you.
Are you threatening me?
It's not a threat, it's a fact.
Now get out of here.
What's going on here?
You tell me.
This kids not part of my program and neither are you.
You better talk to your boy Hector.
I will, get over here Hector.
You stay out of this, Dan.
You okay, kid?
No, I need to lie down.
Come on, let's get you up.
I can't.
I can't get up.
Come on, I will give you a ride home.
Here, look up.
Matthew?
Matthew?
[light knock]
Hey, what happened, baby?
Nothing Mom, everything is fine, just leave me alone right now please.
Is that guy still bothering you?
Mom, stay out of it.
I am going to call the school.
No, Mom, don't do that.
Look at me, Matthew.
Matthew, look at me.
Oh no, this is unacceptable, I am telling the principal.
Mom, it's just a bruise, if you jump in it's not going to make anything better it's going to make everything worse.
I can try to deal with this on my own.
No, I think you have had enough trying it on your own.
I agree with Matthew, I think maybe you and I should hold off before we get involved.
But, look.
He's not a kid, he's a young man.
A lot of people were there, even a teacher saw it okay.
Now I can do this, so just let me.
Okay.
Okay.
I will go make some pizza, from scratch.
[loud sanding noise]
Hey Dan.
What do you want?
Mind if I come in?
[loud sanding noise]
Free country.
[loud sanding noise]
Hey Dan, I have got to talk to you.
So talk.
Can you turn that thing off?
Yeah, I am just finishing up.
You know that kid had no right being in a boxing ring.
Yeah, and your kid had no business doing what he did.
I already spoke to him, he's going to apologize personally and he promises to stay away from your kid.
The kid's name is Matthew.
Swell, he promises to stay away from Matthew.
So, that's it?
Hector beats up a kid for no reason and you just talk to him, he should be suspended.
Quite frankly he should be arrested.
Dan.
You know I am right, but you're not going to let anything happen to him.
Bottom line is Hector Torres is the best fighter this school, this town, has ever had.
He's fighting the toughest league in the state and no one can compete with him, the kid's going to the amateurs.
Oh then he's going to the pros, maybe the Olympics first.
And if you're lucky you will be there to carry his spit bucket.
It's a heck of a lot better than cleaning up after him.
I know what you're doing.
I am doing it too, alright.
We see ourselves in these kids and we push them to be great, the only difference is my kid's got it and your's doesn't.
And if you don't put an end to it he's going to wind up just like you, hurt and defeated.
You know, you may be right about me.
Because when you and I were coming up
I did everything the wrong way.
And I put my ego in front of the sport.
But this kid has something that you and I and Hector don't have.
This kids got heart.
[laughs] Heart.
Come on Dan.
Look at you, you're out with an injury, me, well let's just say I am better off behind the ropes.
But Hector's got what it takes to go the distance.
Yeah, well I am willing to bet you wrong about Matthew.
[laugh]
I will make you a deal.
What kind of deal?
Let Matthew fight in the box-off, just give him a fair shot.
Let him fight Hector inside the ropes with a ref.
Are you crazy?
I will train him and take full responsibility.
Or I'd be happy to talk to the principal about what happened yesterday.
Maybe he'd like to see Matthew's shiner, maybe he'd like to talk to a few of the witnesses.
You're serious?
Yeah, I am dead serious.
The kids got no style, he can't compete, he's going to get hurt out there.
I believe in him.
Alright, alright, fine.
But you get the parents to sign off on this.
No problem.
Hey Champ, what's up?
Nothing.
Yeah, I was looking for you.
Are you coming by the shop?
Maybe not today.
Missing a day, huh?
That's no way to train, Matthew.
I know, it's just, I just...
Just what?
Hey kid, you hit the mat.
Every champion hits the mat sooner or later, the question is are you going to get back up?
I just don't know if I have what it takes.
You know who Cus D'Amato was?
Yeah sure, he trained Mike Tyson.
So then you know the story about the hero and the coward.
Sort of.
The hero is the hero because he's not afraid and the coward is the coward because he is.
Something like that, but it's not just about being scared.
It's what you do when you feel that way, how you react to your fear, that's what makes you the hero or the coward.
So, what am I?
You tell me.
I am not going to lie to you, Matthew.
There's no guarantees.
Every fight is different, but it's you who determines who you are.
A misfit.
We're all misfits.
But the only person who can stop you from doing something is you.
So, are we going to train or not?
You got a fight coming up.
Wait, what?
I do?
Coach Howard agreed to let you back in the box-offs.
Woah, woah, Dan, how does that work?
Every contender fights Hector Torres.
You are a contender.
Dan, he's going to kill me.
Yeah, maybe, but if you win you're on the team.
Yeah, and if I lose?
You did your best and that's good enough now pick up your books.
That's it.
That's it.
Work, work.
Try to buy time.
Good job.
You're definitely getting faster, Matthew.
Yeah, I have been running like you told me to.
Well good, because against Hector you're going to need to throw punches for three minutes of every round, okay?
You show him you're not afraid, that's going to change everything.
I don't know, Dan.
Do you really think that I have got a shot here?
Kid, this is boxing.
Anything can happen.
I talked to my buddy Avery, he said we could use the gym.
So I will set you up a sparring session.
Yeah?
Yeah, but before that happens you're going to have to get these release forms signed by your parents.
Otherwise you can't compete and I can't take you off campus.
Do you want me to talk to them?
No, no, it's okay.
I have got this.
Okay, good job.
Thanks Dan.
Okay, honey.
We're leaving now.
Okay.
Back around 11.
Yeah sure, have a good night.
See you.
Bye.
[birds cawing]
Alright, you know what a fighter's greatest asset is?
Power.
No.
What, speed?
No, those two things are important but most of all, and this is what helped Foreman win the title at 40.
45.
45.
What helped him win the title at 45 was just being relaxed in the ring.
The key to being relaxed in the ring is not getting psyched out by what your opponent is trying to do.
Don't worry about him, just fight your fight.
Stick to your game plan.
Okay.
Use that jab and find your range, okay?
Uh-huh.
Step in.
Alright, you guys keep it light.
Ready, let's box.
Come on Matthew, punch.
Time.
Kid, who's your favourite defensive fighter?
Marlon Starling was supposedly pretty good.
Well, as good as he was he still threw a punch from time to time.
So, throw more punches?
Please, keep your hands up, just like we talked about at school.
Ready?
Hands up.
Alright, let's box.
Go to the body, Matthew,
Don't look at me.
You got to do something, Matthew.
You're not going to have any help in there with Hector.
Do something.
Come on Matthew.
Yes.
That a way.
Time.
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Good job.
How do you feel?
I feel good.
You rocked it.
You really rocked it.
Jab.
Jab.
Jab right hand.
Jab right hand.
And the champion of Aldergrove Secondary School is Matthew Miller.
1, 2.
Time.
Looking good, Matthew.
Looking real good.
As good as Hector?
Don't you worry about Hector.
I have to, he's the school champion.
So what?
Sometimes the champion isn't as interesting as the challenger.
I guess.
See that picture there in the middle?
Yeah.
That's me and Coach Howard.
The boxing coach at school?
Yeah.
It's the day we fought the Golden Gloves when we were your age.
Did you win?
Well, I am not the one holding the trophy but I thought I won.
A lot of people thought I won.
Sometimes the judges seems like they see a different fight.
Yeah, that's like when James Toney fought Dave Taberi.
I am not sure I remember that one.
Well, supposedly Taberi won the fight but the judges gave Toney the decision.
Now that fight was in 1992 before I was born and Taberi never fought again.
Can't win them all, that's why you have got to love the sport and not the glory.
Yeah.
Need a ride home?
No, I am just going to bike it home.
[train sounds]
Are we looking for a house?
You know, you guys can just let me out and I can find it myself.
You don't need to waste your time.
No, I want to know where you're going, we will pick you up.
Okay.
She said it's number 1042.
Are her parents going to be home?
Probably.
There.
That's it.
Kind of an odd neighbourhood.
She lives here?
Well, maybe her parents work from home.
That's not all that uncommon.
Is that Ruby?
Yup, that's great.
Thanks Jacob.
Bye Mom.
I just want to get out.
No, please don't.
Just pick me up at 11, okay.
Thank you.
Matthew.
Hi.
Are those your parents?
Yeah, something like that.
Come on.
This is so cool.
I wonder how they did that, make movies like this back then.
It took forever,
I mean no one had ever seen anything like this.
Do your parents have a lot of movies?
Yeah.
Hundreds.
Thousands.
Wow, that's really cool.
What do your parents do?
Well, I don't really have a Dad and we lived with my Grandfather.
My Mom is a florist, she had her own shop and everything.
Cool.
She is so pretty.
Well, don't you think she's pretty?
Yeah, you are too.
Shut up.
Do you really think so?
Yeah.
Of course.
You're sweet.
Yo, Adrian.
We did it.
Yo.
Stop it, you're embarrassing me.
I am sorry, just that was awesome.
Sit down.
[laughs]
Never been here with anyone before,
I mean I am usually with my parents.
Yeah well, it's really cool just watching movies here like this, with you.
In our own private drive in and I think I am going to kiss you again.
Has anyone ever told you just to be quiet?
Well, do you think I am weird because I talk so much?
No, I think you're weird because you're weird.
Yes.
I mean, I think we should just kind of hang out.
More of the same.
Hey, loser.
Look, it's the loser and his loser girlfriend, the perfect couple.
Come on, Ruby.
You know what, leave us alone you meathead jock.
meathead jock.
Didn't Matthew tell you, he's a meathead jock now, we're going to be fighting.
And if he wins which is impossible he's going to be on the team.
Oh, he's going to win.
He's going to kick your butt in front of everybody.
Ruby.
You better tell your girl to watch her mouth or she might get you in trouble.
You know what, back off Hector.
What are you going to do if I don't?
Ahhh.
Don't even think about telling coach about this, okay, because you threw the first punch.
You okay?
Yeah, I am fine.
I hope you destroy that guy.
Yeah, me too.
[bell ringing]
So, Ruby said that you went over to her place on Saturday?
Actually, we watched that movie from English class at her parents drive in.
You should have called me, I have to watch that movie.
I mean, Mrs. Nasher's making me rewrite my paper because she doesn't think I read it.
Yeah, because you didn't.
I don't know, just go rent it or something.
So, what's going on between you two?
Normal stuff.
What's that mean?
Normal stuff?
Whatever guys and girls do that's normal.
Like kissing?
Yeah, that's normal, right?
Really?
Did you guys like french kiss or--?
Hey guys, what's up?
Hey, we were just talking about kissing you.
Nick.
What?
What did you tell him?
Don't be mad, it was just--
He told me you kissed.
Well, it's none of your pea-brained business.
What else did you say?
Nothing, he asked and I--
Come on, Ruby.
You guys are such losers.
Ruby, wait.
Nick.
Matthew, Matthew, wait, she's just PMSing.
No, she's mad.
No, now is not the time.
Trust me, your life is at risk.
Boring.
But is it Math?
Is it Math?
Looking good.
Looking good.
What is this?
[bell ringing]
Okay kids please.
Oh thank you thank you, that is wonderful.
You just made my day.
Matthew, can I have a word with you?
Yeah, sure.
You having trouble with the assignments?
No, not really.
Really?
I only ask because you haven't turned in two so far this semester, you missed another one this week.
I am so so sorry Mr. Doyle,
I will make up the assignments I promise.
Okay, good.
Because you know, I am here to help you.
Homework is important, it's worth half your grade.
I know, I just forgot.
Alright, so when are you going to have the assignments in by?
I don't know, soon I guess.
You guess?
It better be soon or I am going to have to call your parents,
I only let students miss two assignments per semester, you're over the limit.
If you don't get good grades you can't sign up for any clubs or teams.
Wait, what if I just did them right now?
Right now?
Yeah, I have got a spare.
I can stay and we can do them right here, if you don't mind.
Sure, right now.
You're just going to do three assignments right now, in your spare.
Just right now.
Sure.
I can do it.
Of course, good idea.
Let's just do three assignments right now, there you go.
3, 2, 6, and 7, is 39...
I was laughing my head off.
Anyway, it wasn't until after that I realized
I had ketchup all over my--
I had ketchup all over my face.
It was like the most embarrassing thing ever.
Hey Dan.
Dan?
Mr. Barns?
Hey Mom.
Matthew.
Jacob, what are you doing home?
Why don't you come in the living room and talk with your mother and me.
What's going on?
Sit down.
Am I in trouble?
Yes.
Is this about my homework or my--
Is it true that you have been boxing at school and that the janitor has been coaching you?
His name is Dan and yeah I have been getting a few pointers.
But we agreed that you would not box.
Your mother was pretty clear how she felt about that.
Okay, why are you even here?
You're not my father.
Matthew, please.
Maybe, it's because my name is on the release form your principal brought with her today.
Apparently Coach Howard has agreed to let Matthew participate in the box-off.
Dan, Mr. Barns, was adamant that he had made it clear to Matthew that he needed to have one of you sign the permission form.
He understood that you had turned it into the office.
I am very sorry about this, with upwards of 700 students we just can't know what they're doing all the time.
We expect our staff to be diligent and we had to let Dan go.
What?
How long has this been going on, Matthew?
This is not Dan's fault, this was my fault, he was just doing me a favour, he was standing up for me.
If he's not there then I quit.
I quit school, I don't care because this is wrong.
Be quiet, Matthew.
No, I will not be quiet.
What has gotten into you?
Mom, I need to do this because I am good at it and I need to be good at something,
I have put so much time and effort--
Yes.
And you lied to us.
Christine.
Hey, Matthew.
Alright, let's all just sit down and listen for a moment.
Mom, nobody thinks that I can make this team but I think I have a shot and Dan thinks I have a shot.
He's given me a chance to do something here, he's like my only friend, he's someone who actually believes in me.
Hey, I am somebody who actually believes in you.
Your mother is somebody who actually believes in you.
No she's not, she always thinks I am going to fail or I am going to get hurt or--
Well, we have been talking here and your mother and I have both agreed to let you fight in the box-offs.
With Dan's help.
No, absolutely not.
But he's my trainer.
Lower your voice, Matthew.
He shouldn't have been your trainer, that's the point.
He was fired because that's not his job and he shouldn't be interfering with students or their activities.
He did his job.
He didn't do anything wrong.
He knows more about boxing than that stupid coach at school.
I am done.
Okay, I am leaving because this is wrong.
This is so wrong.
Matthew.
That will get you there.
Thank you.
Alright.
[birds cawing]
Mr. Barns.
Hey, Matthew.
Sorry things turned out this way.
I am sorry that I lied about getting my parents permission.
So am I kid.
I can't go back to that school if you're not there.
Don't get carried away kid, life goes on.
I am sorry that you lost your job,
I wasn't trying to get you in trouble.
I agreed to be your trainer Matthew but you had to tell your parents.
That was our deal.
You broke the bond between trainer and fighter.
I know.
I know.
Relax kid, if anybody should be crying it ought to be me.
I am the one that got fired, not you.
So, why aren't you?
You think I wanted to be a janitor for the rest of my life?
Kid, I had dreams just like everybody else.
Lately they haven't seemed to go my way.
The question is what are you going to do?
About what?
Well, you have got a fight coming up.
Dan, I can't do it without you.
Well then what the heck are you doing this for, kid?
It hasn't been for me.
But you're not even going to be there.
Listen, kid.
You're alone anyway.
I am not in the ring with you,
I don't have a pair of gloves on,
I am just there in the corner to guide you along.
You know for three minutes of every round it's just you and your opponent.
Nothing else matters.
For three minutes of every round you get to show everybody exactly what Matthew Miller is made of.
I am scared, Dan.
Hector wants you to feel scared, son.
He's expecting you not to fight.
But you show up win or lose as long as you get in that ring and do your best, you fight that fear, you win no matter what.
You think I can beat Hector?
It doesn't matter what I think, it matters what you think.
Now get out of here.
[alarm buzzer]
Morning.
Morning.
Oh, you should have come down quicker, it's probably all mushy by now.
Mom, it's fine.
I don't know if I can do this honey.
I mean I went once when I was a little girl to watch Dad and I,
I threw up, I just threw up when I saw Dad getting hit and all the blood and oh dear.
We don't have to go Christine.
Mom, it's fine.
Whatever you decide, it's okay.
Now, I am going to go run a couple laps before first period.
Okay, I love you.
Bye, bye Jacob.
Love you.
Okay.
Hey Matthew.
Hey.
It's the big day.
Should we reserve a hospital bed for you?
Shut up, Nick.
Come on, I am just joking.
You know, ease up the tension.
I hate boxing, I mean I hate sports, but I am coming to watch you so if you win--
When he wins.
When you win just don't become a dumb jock, okay?
Come on, I won't.
Okay, well see you two.
Hey.
Hey.
How you been?
I have missed you.
I have missed you too okay, I am sorry that I blabbed.
Hey, I totally overreacted.
I drew you.
You winning the boxing match.
Wow.
Ruby, that's just how I imagined it.
I am not quite done though.
I think I am going to add Hector somewhere in there, maybe on the floor, knocked out.
You know, I think I like it the way it is.
Just me.
Well, Mr. Confident.
I should probably be getting to class, but I will see you later.
Oh yeah.
And, Matthew?
Yeah?
Good luck in the ring.
Look who showed up.
So, who's working your corner, Matthew?
He's so scared.
He can't talk.
Is that true?
Are you so scared you can't even speak?
No Hector.
I am just too busy thinking about how stupid you sound when you open your mouth.
Oh-ho-ho.
And Joe, you smell like a dumpster, when was the last time you showered?
Now is your chance to laugh it up dork, because once we get in the ring one things for sure.
You're going to die.
Nice comeback, champ.
Dan.
How you doing, kid?
I am good.
I am nervous.
You should be nervous.
Five minutes, boys.
I just came to wish you good luck.
Thanks.
I just want you to block everything out and do what you have been taught to do.
I will do my best.
Just remember, Hectors just as nervous as you are.
See you out there.
(Announcer):
Please welcome our own Aldergrove boxing team, and Contenders.
[crowd cheering loudly]
[crowd cheering loudly]
Hey guys, how's it going?
You feel good?

Alright, first up, get your gear on.
First up, get your gear on.
[crowd cheering]
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to welcome you to the 10th annual
Aldergrove Secondary School Box-off.
Today we will be watching our current and present champions all competing against new challengers who will all be fighting for their positions on the team.
We will be having fights with five of the traditional eight weight categories that boxing has to offer, and each challenger will have three rounds lasting three minutes each to secure their spots.
Let's box.
[crowd cheering]
[ding] [crowd cheering]
Hey, long time no see.
Dad.
What are you doing here?
Your husband called me, I appreciate it sir.
Well, I knew he was going to be pleased, this is a huge day for him.
Glad to be here.
[crowd cheering]
Hit him on the inside.
Follow it up.
[ding, ding]
Good job.
Let's hear it for our heavyweight contenders.
[cheering and applause]
And now in our light heavyweight class please welcome our State champion in the 1600 division,
Joe Fielde.
Come on Joe.
Come over here guys, come on.
I know you both know the rules, alright.
I want a clean fight, you got three rounds to make this team?
Any questions?
Alright, let's touch gloves, have a good fight.
Fight.
[ding] [crowd cheering]
Come on Joe, you have got to hit him one time.
[crowd cheering]
Yes.
Yes.
What?
[crowd cheering] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...
(Dan's voice):
Everybody's afraid, Matthew, but how you react to that fear is what makes you the hero or the coward.
...9 [crowd cheering]
Hey, you ready?
You ready?
Yeah, yes.
Let's see what you got.
Okay.
Come on, Matt.
Go Matthew.
Come on, Matthew.
You can do it, come on.
(Dan's voice):
You don't think Joe Fraser was nervous before he fought Ali?
Now, in the middleweight division our final contender and challenger, Matthew Miller.
And defending in this division, our state champion, Hector Torres.
[crowd cheering]
Come over here, Hector.
Come on Hector, just do it.
[crowd cheering]
Hey Miller.
(Dan's voice):
You fight that fear and you will win, no matter what.
Snap out of it.
Alright, remember, you have got three rounds, three minutes each.
No low blows, no rabbit punches, in case of a knock down
I want you to go to the neutral corner.
Alright.
If that ref says break,
I want you to break clean, any questions?
No one's in your corner, pansy.
Hey, take it easy Hector.
Whatever you say, coach.
Let's have a good fight.
[crowd cheering]
Ready?
Ready?
[ding]
Fight.
(Dan's voice):
Hector wants you to be afraid, Matthew, he wants you to give up.
Hands up, Matthew, hands up.
Good job, Hector.
Oh my God.
I can't.
Okay, step back, come on, fight.
(Dan's voice):
Don't worry about what Hector's doing, just fight your fight.
Nice.
Jab, Matthew, jab.
[ding ding]
Alright, over to the corner.
Keep it clean.
There's no one looking after that boy.
Start playing by the rules buddy, look at me when I am talking to you.
How am I supposed to back you up if you're not playing by the rules, huh?
Don't blow this for yourself.
Here.
Now, sit sit sit.
Grandpa?
Here's some water, reach out your mouth.
What are you doing here?
Your new father called me, don't worry, it's all good.
Yeah.
Is Mom okay?
Just concentrate on the match.
You don't think about anything else.
That last round was good, but you have got to throw some more punches.
Yeah, I know, I am counting.
Counting what?
Well, he throws six punches and then he breaks and that's when I have got to hit him.
That's a good observation.
But you have got to keep your hands up but don't lose sight of him, don't hide.
Come out with your hands nice and loose.
The last round you have got him good.
He got me, is there a lot of blood?
Nah, it's not much.
He fights like a baby.
Come on.
[ding] [crowd cheering]
Go Matthew.
Take control.
(Dan's voice):
If you're going to win this fight you have to block everything out.
Over there, over there.
[crowd cheering]
Come on.
Come on, Matthew.
[crowd cheering]
(Dan's voice):
Keep your chin down, Matthew, eyes up.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[ding] [crowd cheering]
Yeah, that's right.
It's all me.
How you doing, son?
You had enough?
No.
He popped you good there, getting through those gloves.
There you go, cool you down.
Kid, how are you?
Dan.
You're doing great, keep working the body though, okay?
You find those ribs and you keep working those ribs, you pound him.
Three minutes to go in this fight.
Okay, you hear me?
The guy behind me he's getting sloppy and he's getting tired.
You see that, he's getting sloppy and tired.
Okay, this is your round, this is your round.
Okay?
Give me everything you got.
I will, I promise.
All in the ring.
I promise.
Oh, he's a baby.
After him.
[ding]
Come on, Matthew.
Come on.
Concentrate, Matthew.
Come on, Matthew.
You can do it, come on.
(Dan's voice):
Stay in the moment, Matthew.
Nothing else matters.
[loud cheers]
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...
Yeah buddy, yeah.
Alright, let me see your gloves.
Fight.
Come on, Matthew.
Come on Matthew, come on.
(Dan's voice):
This is your chance, Matthew, show the world exactly what you're made of.
[ding, ding] [loud cheers]
[loud cheers]
Whooo.
Go Matthew.
Get over there and do the right thing, son.
Go on.
Hey, that was a good match, you hit pretty hard.
Yeah, you too.
So, after three great rounds of action the judges tally is in.
And the score is 2 rounds to 1, for the current middleweight champion of Aldergrove Secondary School, Hector Torres.
[loud cheers]
I think he did alright.
Yeah.
It's alright, Matt.
Way to go.
What?
I lost.
But you lasted three rounds kid, you showed the heart of a champion.
You're a winner to me all the way, son.
But I lost.
Yeah, that's how you do it.
I am taking Aldergrove Secondary to the top, we're going to be the best in the whole league.
Yeah.
Let's go.
[loud cheers]
I just want you all to know what a great discovery
I think Matthew Miller is, and I definitely think there's room for him as an alternate in the middleweight division for the Aldergrove Boxing Team, what do you say?
[loud cheers]
After all, Hector graduates this year and we're going to need someone to win some championships for Aldergrove, how about that?
I want to be on the team, I want to be on the team.
Come on up here and say a couple words.
Thank you coach.
Well, I just wanted to thank my parents for always telling me that I am a fighter.
My best friends Nick and Ruby for never letting me fight alone.
My grandpa for being in my corner and finally my coach, Dan Barns for telling me that I could be a champ.
[cheers]
Alright, thanks again everyone for coming out and supporting the Aldergrove Boxing Team.
Good job, kid.
We couldn't do it without you, looking forward to another successful season, see you all at the first fight.
So, you going to stick around?
No, I am going to get moving kid.
I have got some dreams I want to chase.
These are yours, so.
No, no, hang on to them, they look good on you, okay?
Okay.
Listen, I will see you down the road, alright.
It's been a pleasure.
Thanks coach, happy trails.
Hey.
You were amazing.
You totally surprised me.
I surprised myself.
You were transformed.
Not completely.
Mom.
Matthew.
You were so brave.
So ridiculously brave.
Did you actually see me or were you watching through your fingers?
No, I kept my eyes open for the most part,
I am a big girl now.
Alright, picture time, get in close in, guys.
Alright.
Well, look at that, three generations.
Alright.
Is this Ruby?
Yeah, that's Ruby.
Well get in there, dear.
There we go.
Where's Dan the man?
He left.
He's gone?
Like, really gone?
Yeah, like totally gone.
You're okay with that?
Yeah, I am okay.
Just shows you Matt, a good coach makes all the difference.
There we go.
I will take it, you get in there.

[FESTIVE MUSIC PLAYING INDISTINCTLY ON SPEAKERS]
MAN:
Hey, I'll wait here.
Good morning.
Welcome to The Freemont Inn.
- How can I help you?
- I'd like a room.
Oh, I'm sorry, we're all full for tonight.
Christmas Eve, no room at the inn.
Who would've guessed, right?
Are you sure?
I'll take anything you got.
Please.
Well, forecast is calling for snow.
Maybe we've had some cancellations.
Ah.
Looks like the only thing we have available is our Premiere Suite at the holiday rate.
I'll take it.
Don't you wanna know how much first?
Nope.
Okay.
[FESTIVE MUSIC PLAYING QUIETLY ON TV]
It's me.
I think we're clear.
I'm on my way down to get you.
[ELEVATOR DINGS]
It's Christmas Eve.
- Yes, it is, Tony.
TONY:
And we drew the short straw.
We have to work, why are you smiling?
You did not tell us that Wendy sent you a Christmas card.
- Wendy who?
- Your Wendy.
- Baltimore Wendy.
- Your former fiancée, Wendy.
Oh.
What are you doing reading my Christmas cards?
ZIVA:
It was pinned on the wall behind your desk.
People usually do that so that others can enjoy them.
I thought you and, uh, Wendy haven't talked in...
Nine years.
What's your point?
So it says here that she and her ex-husband divorced last year.
I read that.
Too bad, very sad.
And she invited you to Christmas brunch tomorrow with her and her 7-year-old son, Fred.
Pretty cute.
So you gonna go?
No.
I think I'll relegate that part of my life
- to Christmas past.
- Huh.
Well, I get the impression that Wendy may be looking to try again with you.
- You think so?
PALMER:
No.
No, no, of course not.
I wouldn't dream of blowing him off, Breena.
Okay.
I'll call you later.
TONY:
Tiny Jim, to what do we owe this lovely sweater vest?
Thank you, Tony, for noticing.
It was a gift from Breena.
Heh.
Actually, unfortunately, my gift to her should be arriving at any minute.
I agreed to give her father a tour of NCIS while he's in town for the holidays.
Well, that is nice.
Actually, I thought Director Vance would nix the idea.
You and Breena's dad do not get along?
The last time that Ed and I talked was when I asked for his permission to marry Breena.
He laughed.
And then he cried from laughing so hard.
Then he got really quiet.
So why is he coming here?
Breena wanted us to bond before the wedding.
She thinks his main problem with me is my job.
Autopsy Gremlin.
Yeah, if we could keep that talk to a minimum while he's here.
I say it with the utmost respect.
No, I know that, I know that.
But Ed doesn't.
You guys, he actually thinks that I'm stuck in some government job which pays too little and requires too many hours.
GIBBS:
You are.
Get off my desk.
- Grab your gear.
- Ah!
Yes.
Uh...
Duty calls.
So I had better call Ed and cancel.
GIBBS:
You're not going anywhere, Palmer.
Family first.
Nice sweater.
ZIVA:
Merry Christmas, Palmer.
ZIVA:
Navy Captain Jake Marsden.
Stationed in Charleston, South Carolina.
According to his driver's license, he also lives there.
GIBBS:
Tourist.
Desk clerk said he was in a hurry to get to his room.
For good reason, judging by those wounds.
Blood spatter indicates that he was standing about here when multiple gunshots went through him.
GIBBS:
Looks like different calibers.
Multiple weapons.
Multiple shooters.
Guests did not hear anything that sounded gunshots.
The gunmen must have used silencers.
No fingerprints or evidence were left behind.
Pro job.
Humbug.
Twenty-five bucks for valet parking.
It's highway robbery.
Actually, I wouldn't rule out highway robbery.
Look at that, the passenger window has been blown out.
Bullet holes.
Looks like it's been sideswiped.
McGEE:
Valet said they found it this way.
That's what they always say, isn't it?
Hey, thought our dead guy was Navy.
You know, you, uh, never mentioned why you broke off the engagement with Wendy.
Who said I broke it off?
What, did she leave you at the altar?
Didn't say that either.
Yahoo.
Marine seabag, woman's bra.
Either our dead Navy captain was having an identity crisis or he wasn't traveling alone.
Agent David, would you give me a hand in wrapping up the captain?
I was premature in giving Mr. Palmer the morning off.
[PHONE RINGING]
If that's the hotel manager, tell him we won't take the body through his lobby.
Gibbs.
The call's not coming from inside the hotel.
The area code, that's northern Maryland.
WOMAN [OVER PHONE]:
Jake?
Is that you?
What happened?
Well, I'd like to know the same thing.
- You killed him, didn't you?
- He's dead, but I didn't do it.
- Who is this?
- Who is this?
Are you a cop?
- NCIS.
- Prove it.
How?
If you are who you say, you'll figure it out.
TONY:
Navy Captain Jake Marsden.
Single, no family, well-liked.
But according to his unit, the only thing he made time for was his job.
It's kind of sad, really.
Precisely why you should reconsider lunch with Wendy.
McGee and I searched Marsden's car, nothing that IDs the female travel companion.
- Perhaps she was our mystery caller.
- McGee, hotel phone records.
Prior to the murder, our victim made one outgoing phone call from the hotel room.
To a cell phone registered in his own name.
- You track it?
- It's been turned off.
- Incoming to the room?
McGEE:
I already ran a backtrace.
- The call to the hotel came from...
PALMER:
Hey, team.
Just came to introduce my future father-in-law, Ed Slater.
This a bad time?
Go ahead.
Okay.
Ed, this, uh...
Mr. Slater, this is, uh, our fearless leader,
Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
Over here we have Special Agent Anthony "Tony" DiNozzo.
Stop speaking, James.
I don't need their dossiers.
Only here for a few hours, but what a pleasure.
- Welcome to NCIS, Mr. Slater.
- Ah.
Can't say enough about your future son-in-law and his work ethic here.
Yes, well, that's why I'm here, isn't it?
To make sure that if my daughter marries James, she gets him, not the bureaucratic baggage that comes with a government job.
You know?
- No.
- No?
No.
I'm sorry.
Did you just say "if she marries him"?
Big "if." Let me ask you something, Special Super-Agent Gibbs.
You the only team leader who makes his folks work Christmas Eve?
I guess when Uncle Sam calls, you answer, even when he calls collect.
[CHUCKLING]
Ha...!
I think we've seen all we should in the squad room.
Why don't I show you, uh, any place else?
[WHISPERS] I'm so sorry.
He's a pleasant man.
McGee, phone call to the hotel.
McGEE:
Traced the number.
Call came from a courtesy phone in an outlet mall in Fillmore, Maryland.
That's two hours from here.
If our mystery woman was at the hotel, how did she get out there?
Find her.
Find out.
Pulling mall security footage now.
DUCKY:
A visit to the National Christmas Tree.
Followed by a production of The Nutcracker at the Kennedy Center.
Sadly, captain, your visit to D.C.
Was much too brief to enjoy our city's holiday fare.
He always talk to himself?
Actually, Mr. Slater, I am conversing with our victim.
Well, it's a waste of time.
In my experience, the dead are dead.
And what experience would that be?
- Well...
- Ed owns a funeral home.
Heh.
I guess that is where Breena got her passion for embalming, huh?
- You know, I always used to tell her...
- You're speaking again, James.
Uh.
I'm a professional mortician, Dr. Mallard.
Then you should know that everybody has a unique story to tell if asked the right questions.
Maybe.
But, uh, as much as you talk, this poor guy can hardly get a word in edgewise, huh?
[ED PALMER LAUGHING]
I think it best if you two wait outside.
- Yeah, I'll second that.
- Look...
Motion carried.
A lot of things to see.
This is fun, huh?
Doc, what do you got?
Confirmation of cause of death and this.
When I took off the captain's clothes,
I found it stuffed deep in a pants pocket.
Dried blood.
His?
Well, that's up to Abby.
But apart from the bullet wounds, which are fresh, there's no other exterior signs of trauma anywhere.
Well, it could be from our missing woman.
Well, if it were, it would suggest that in addition to being on the run, she could also be wounded.
[PHONE RINGING]
- Abs?
ABBY:
Can you come to the lab?
GIBBS:
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Abs?
Abby?
ABBY:
Back here.
Oh.
Thank goodness it's just you.
Jimmy and his grinch-in-law have been stalking the halls spreading ill-will and yuletide yuck-ness.
Hey, did he try to pick a fight with you in the squad room?
- No, he was just being...
- Unseasonably, unreasonably rude.
He's being a father-in-law-to-be.
If he knows what's good for him, he's not gonna come "a-wassailing"
within at least 20 feet of my leaves of green.
- What have we got?
- Mall security footage, courtesy of McGee, and the kind people at the Carroll County Outlet Shoppes, the jewel of Carroll County.
I don't think there's a lot to do in Carroll County.
Did you find our female caller?
Granting you your first Christmas wish, Gibbs.
That is her, calling the hotel.
Now, if the blood on the rag that Ducky found is hers, she doesn't appear wounded.
Get an ID?
No.
But I think I know where she is.
Watch when she turns towards the camera.
If you are who you say, you will figure it out.
- Bag?
- Yeah.
It's from a women's clothing store.
She knew that we would watch the security footage.
She wants you to come find her, Gibbs.
Nice work.
Tell DiNozzo to have local P.D. Meet us there.
Welcome to Carroll County.
You must be NCIS.
Snow is really coming down out there, huh?
- So they, uh, sent a mall cop, huh?
BILLY:
No, sir.
I'm a county deputy.
Officer Billy McCormick.
I was the only one on duty when you called.
You got an update, deputy?
Yes, sir.
I canvassed the store but haven't found anyone in distress.
Whoever you're looking for must have left already.
How hard did you look?
I talked to every single solitary person.
What about in the dressing rooms?
Well, no.
This is a women's clothing store, so...
TONY:
Yeah.
Yeah.
We are looking for a woman, though.
Get everybody out of here.
Will do, boss.
Good job, though.
Good job.
MAN:
Can I have your attention, please?
Everyone needs to leave the store immediately.
Exit is this way.
Please.
- Federal agents.
Go on, get out of here.
- Okay.
[THUD]
NCIS.
Yeah, I've seen fake credentials before.
Hand over your weapons.
There's only one way to get a Marine's weapon.
What do you know about it?
You a leatherneck?
Where do you think I got this haircut?
If you aren't the ones that killed Jake, that means they're still out there.
- You think they're after you too?
- I know they are.
Jake wasn't the target.
I am.
GIBBS:
Did my I.T.S. At Camp LeJeune.
You like it there, Lieutenant Reynolds?
Call me Emma.
And yes, I did.
- Wish like hell I was there now.
- Weather is getting pretty bad, boss.
Tractor trailer jackknifed on the highway.
It's bumper-to-bumper.
You out getting coffee, DiNozzo?
No, no, no.
This is hot chocolate for the pregnant lieutenant.
Uh, listen, everyone, I don't want any special treatment.
I'm a Marine first and pregnant second.
- Hoo-rah!
- Hoo-right.
ZIVA:
I will gladly take the special treatment.
I like mine with extra marshmallows.
The little tiny ones, please.
Who do you think I am, your elf?
Actually, I'll take one with marshmallows too.
Heh, thought you said you didn't want any special...
Extra marshmallows, coming up.
So who is after you, lieutenant?
I don't know.
Only ever been a squared-away Marine until eight and a half months ago.
I was stationed outside Kabul.
Our unit was training local Afghan soldiers.
One of them spoke English.
His name was Amir.
Things got romantic.
Heh.
At least what passes for romantic in that hellhole.
Sand can get in some pretty inconvenient places.
- Any disciplinary action?
- I took responsibility.
CO made me forfeit two months' pay and sent me stateside.
- Thought that was it.
- But?
Last week, I noticed I was being followed by a black SUV.
I would shake it, then another one would show up.
- Multiple people were following you?
- Three men, separate SUVs.
I got one of the license numbers.
It was registered to the Department of Defense.
- Call McGee.
Have him follow up.
- Mm-hm.
So you skipped town with Marsden?
Jake's an old friend.
He offered to drive me to my parents' place in Ohio.
But that's when things got crazy.
They followed you.
They tried to run us off the road.
I cut my hand when the window broke.
And we lost them, but I started feeling woozy, so we went to the hotel.
When Jake didn't come down, I knew that I had to get out of there.
Why didn't you call the police?
If these guys were government, they would send local LEOs looking for us too.
I don't know what this is about or how far up this goes.
Well, you can trust us.
Thank you.
Where's the father now?
McGEE:
The baby's father is dead?
Yes.
Amir Mayat died in an IED explosion back in May.
It says here Lieutenant Reynolds went on leave after the incident.
What about the in-laws?
They must have some interest in the child.
Well, according to her statement, she and Amir kept the pregnancy a secret from his family.
You know, Agent McGee, all of this is in her personnel file.
You don't need me to read it to you.
Hang on.
What is it you really wanna know?
Is that file the only record DoD has on Lieutenant Reynolds?
- What do you mean?
- Someone is having her followed.
You think it's us?
We're DoD, not CIA.
- We don't usually do that kind of thing.
- Usually.
Why would we care what Reynolds does on her maternity leave?
We have reason to believe that three gunmen, using vehicles registered to the DoD, murdered a Navy captain and are now after the lieutenant.
What are you suggesting?
You know how many vehicles we have registered in this city?
Thousands.
They get stolen all the time.
I'd be happy to check our database for you.
I understand that, sir, but you're not answering my question.
Is Lieutenant Reynolds on your radar?
Agent McGee, the only thing on my radar right now is Santa Claus.
I understand, sir.
But you will let us know if you find out anything on Lieutenant Reynolds?
Even if I did, I couldn't tell you without authorization.
Feliz Navidad.
GIBBS:
Yeah, Abs?
- Gibbs, what are you still doing there?
The snow is falling faster than my holiday spirit.
There's a pregnant Marine being hunted on Christmas.
- Heaven and nature are not singing.
- I'm waiting on intel and escort from state troopers.
Tell me what you got.
Background on Lieutenant Reynolds' baby daddy.
Amir Mayat.
And he is not a poor farmer.
The Mayat tribe controls a massive and critical land parcel just outside of Kabul.
- The family is wealthy.
- Extremely.
And Amir was the sole male heir.
- Till he was killed.
- Yes.
- And if Emma has a boy, then...
- The kid inherits everything.
Practically royalty.
At least extremely valuable.
That explains why the lieutenant is still alive.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
They don't want her dead.
They want the baby.
Alive.
- It doesn't explain DoD's involvement.
McGEE:
This might, boss.
What, McGee?
I did some digging.
I tunneled under the DoD firewall.
Turns out U.S. Military forces in Afghanistan are trying to build a trade highway through Mayat land.
It's vital for fighting insurgents and stopping weapons shipments.
ABBY:
And the tribal elders aren't cooperating which is costing the DoD millions of dollars.
And if the project goes under, they lose even more.
Well, they need a bargaining chip.
The little baby heir.
By birthright, he'll be head of the Mayat tribe.
They have the kid, they have the land.
- Can we prove it?
McGEE:
I can't find anything concrete connecting the DoD and our three kings.
Keep looking.
[TAPPING ON WINDOW]
How long have they been back there?
Not long enough.
ED:
Door?
I can't hear a word they're saying.
PALMER:
If you hadn't made that remark about her tattoos, we wouldn't be in time out.
Still got six minutes left.
You do know that there are jobs in the private sector where you could make twice as much money and still be home by 6, right?
Hadn't really thought about that.
Well, maybe you should start.
And all I said to her was that girls with tattoos are easy.
Everyone knows that.
Is something wrong?
What did you find out?
I'll tell you on the way out.
The car is out back, boss.
They started closing highways.
Not gonna open till the morning.
We're on our own.
Back roads?
What if someone follows us?
- Can't wait any longer.
- I want a weapon.
You don't need one, you got us.
Don't patronize me.
I was the top shot in my platoon.
You think Deputy Dawg has ever seen actual combat?
- I did three tours.
- Where is Barney Fife, anyway?
I thought he was out back with you.
- I'm sorry.
MAN:
Shut up.
- He came out of nowhere.
- Shut up!
- He's one of the three.
- NCIS.
Let him go.
Give me the woman.
No, it's not gonna happen.
I don't want to hurt him.
I know exactly what you want.
Drop your weapon.
MAN:
You are in no position to make demands.
I'm not, but she is.
Unless you wanna die today, put it down.
Now!
DiNozzo, you and the deputy take him back.
We got the lieutenant.
All right, meet you back at the Navy Yard.
On it, boss.
[MAN GRUNTS]
What's that all about?
Hedge trimmer accident?
Proof.
- Of what?
ZIVA:
Nerve.
Initiation ritual, common in Russian prison gangs.
Any of your other friends missing fingers?
- You will see for yourself.
- What does that mean?
It means we're getting the hell out of here.
Watch your head.
Oh, there you are.
I hear the team is on its way back with a suspect.
Have you heard anything more?
No.
Just been waiting on Ed.
What's the matter, Mr. Palmer?
Just a bit overwhelmed, I guess.
My own father was only ever encouraging to me.
No matter what I did.
But Ed, Ed is like Ebenezer Scrooge at the beginning of the book.
A bit of advice:
Don't let the disparaging remarks of a myopic individual influence your life.
See, that's just it.
He finally said something nice to me.
- Really?
- He offered me a job.
At his funeral home.
He said Breena and I could work together.
Eventually take over the business.
Really?
Is that what you want?
Me?
No.
No, I love NCIS, but I want to make Breena happy.
Doctor, what if this is the only way?
Breena will be happy if you are happy.
Tell that to Mr. Ed.
Russian mercenaries wanna take my unborn child because he's the only heir to land in Afghanistan?
We believe the gunmen may have been hired by someone inside the government.
Why?
Because that land may be key in winning or losing Afghanistan.
I'm starting to understand why Amir distanced himself from his family.
[ENGINE RATTLES]
What happened?
Is it the engine?
Russians.
There is no signal out here.
There's a light up ahead.
God.
[ZIVA GROANS]
Do you think we can fix it?
I don't think we've got a choice.
I saw a garage around back.
I'll help push.
Don't push.
- You guys are still here, huh?
- Heh.
Well, I'm Ed's ride, and technically I'm still on duty, so...
Duty.
Hey.
Any word from Gibbs?
Not yet.
What do you think is taking them so long?
I don't know.
We left separately.
Must have taken a different route.
Could've hit bad weather.
Did you try calling him?
Abby has been calling every five minutes.
Nothing.
And the land lines are down from here to Baltimore due to ice.
We're lucky we have Internet.
Did you find anything to finger our fingerless man?
I ran his remaining prints.
Name is Veli Tupolev.
No record in the States, but Interpol's a different story.
Let me guess.
Trained mercenary who's used to hard Russian winters and even harder Russian prisons?
Pretty much.
How do you wanna break him?
Well...
[CRUNCHING]
What?
I was hungry.
Didn't know I'd be held hostage.
Wait a second.
Are those Hollander's homemade Christmas cookies from HR?
Did she make molasses this year?
She did, and they were good.
Then we need to commandeer these.
Police business.
I think I have a way to break our bad Santa.
With what, cookies?
What are you gonna do, sugar-board him?
Thought you said they were pros.
The injector rail was damaged.
Fuel leaked into the manifold and caught fire.
Yeah.
I'm gonna have to try to redo some wiring.
- I'll see what they've got.
- Uh-huh.
EMMA:
The phones are still out.
But I'll keep checking.
Or if you want any help in there, I know my way around a car.
No.
Sit down, rest.
Drink some fluids.
No.
I already did.
I left a couple of bucks on the register.
It felt weird just to take it.
GIBBS:
Hey.
Don't worry about it.
It's gonna be fine.
This is not exactly the Christmas Eve that I had planned on, Agent Gibbs.
Actually, I hadn't planned on any of this.
Amir, the baby, people trying to steal him.
Him?
Thought you said you didn't know.
I don't, but I can tell.
Heh.
Ugh.
Judging by the way he's punching and kicking me right now,
- Come on.
- Think he's gonna be a Marine too.
- Sit down.
- Whoo.
I just wanted to be a Marine.
I guess someone else had other plans.
Yeah.
Wouldn't be the first time.
Do you have kids, Agent Gibbs?
Had a daughter.
Were you there when she was born?
Deployed.
Well, I guess I kind of have to be there for mine.
Not that I'm complaining, it's just...
I might be...
Scared.
The hell you say?
- It's all right if you are.
- Not according to the Corps.
That's what I like about being a Marine.
The procedures, the code.
I like having a measurable set of expectations.
I could always tell how good I was doing.
But with this, how do I know?
You don't.
But you'll be able to tell.
Mm.
Right now, I think this guy is telling me that it's time to eat.
Well, in that case...
EMMA:
Mm.
- This one's on me.
- Heh.
Thank you.
You know, Wendy used to make the most kick-ass snickerdoodle.
I'm gonna start with a series of true or false statements
- Mm-hm.
McGEE:
To give us a baseline.
What are you talking about?
TONY:
Just think of it as a lie-detector test.
With cookies.
You just have to sit there and eat.
McGEE:
Okay, here we go.
Your hair is purple.
You have all your fingers.
You were following Lieutenant Emma Reynolds with the intention of abducting her baby.
A little hesitation.
- You see that hesitation?
- Yeah, I did.
TONY:
Confirming hesitation.
No.
No, I did not hesitate.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You sure about that?
You've never committed a crime.
Your favorite color is pink.
You were hired by someone at the United States Department of Defense.
[LAUGHING]
So you really are working for the government.
No.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Sure about that?
So then you must be working for the Mayat tribe in Afghanistan.
[COUGHING]
- Take that as a yes.
- No.
I just choke on cookie.
It does not mean anything.
Oh, it speaks volumes.
This is stupid.
You're just trying to mess with my head.
Then why are you getting so upset if it isn't true?
If the family hired you, they must have found out about the baby.
They need an heir to keep their land.
Not the frosted cutouts.
I will stop eating cookies.
Your prepaid cell we found on you.
TONY:
How are you communicating with your other two associates?
McGEE:
The only number stored on your contacts list is six numbers long.
You're always missing a couple of digits, aren't you?
[CHUCKLES]
Or maybe that's not a mistake.
Maybe it's something else.
- Coordinates?
- Code?
Password?
McGEE:
Radio frequency?
Radio frequency.
I'm gonna go with radio frequency.
You will never get it now.
- We wrote it down, genius.
McGEE:
If they're using radio systems, we should be able to pick up chatter.
TONY:
Not out of him.
Okay, try it.
[ENGINE CLICKING]
Eh.
[GRUNTS]
Try it again.
[ENGINE CLICKING]
Given the parts available, this could prove to be a problem.
EMMA:
Uh, that's not our only problem.
My water just broke.
I'm going into labor.
Hoo-rah?
Good to know you no longer think the government is hunting a pregnant woman.
But I'm afraid I can't help you apprehend the Afghan in-laws that are.
It is Christmas Eve, sir.
Well, that gift would have to come from CENTCOM and about 14 other people above my pay grade.
Yeah.
Let me guess.
It would be wrapped in red tape?
Thanks for nothing.
Got something from our gunman's radio frequency.
And given the weak signal, they've gotta be at least 40 miles away.
MAN 1:
Where are you?
MAN 2:
Not too far.
MAN 1:
Meet me.
Petrol station outside Ridgeville, now.
Sounds like Russians to me.
Searching for gas stations near Ridgeville, Maryland.
TONY:
Pretty small town.
All right, I got a hit on a single service station alongside State Route 15.
Only one reason our gunmen would go there.
- Gibbs.
- Gibbs.
- They're in trouble.
- Could be where they're holed up.
- Did you find Agent Gibbs?
- That's what we're gonna find out.
Hey.
TONY:
Put it in gear, McGee.
Good luck.
Yeah, good luck.
Why in the world would you say it like that?
Why...?
The weather, the road closures.
They're never gonna make it.
How the hell would you know?
They're trained agents.
Well...
You might not respect me or what it is we do here, but you have got to respect the fact that these people, my people, are risking their lives.
Well, if you're gonna put it like that...
There's no other way to put it.
Till you can figure that out, we're not going anywhere.
Sit down and shut up.
The last two were less than a minute apart.
It didn't hurt this much when I took shrapnel in Mosul.
- The whole harness must be sautéed.
- Fried.
Ugh.
[EMMA GASPING]
Unh!
Oh, boy, the baby is coming.
Gibbs, we have company.
What do you wanna do?
Defend our position.
You stay with the lieutenant, I'll draw fire.
EMMA:
Don't you leave me, Gibbs.
I need someone to tell me how I'm doing.
You're doing fine.
I'm not so sure.
Are you asking for special treatment, Marine?
Sir, yes, sir.
Just this once.
ZIVA:
Hey, Gibbs.
It's okay.
Got this covered.
Thank you.
You might wanna hold off on that.
[GRUNTS]
[METALLIC CLANKING]
[EMMA YELLING]
Push.
Push!
Push.
[YELLS]
Push.
[CONTINUES YELLING]
[SHOUTS]
[BOTH GRUNTING]
[BABY CRYING]
Is he okay?
Yeah, she's beautiful.
It's a girl?
She's got her mom's eyes.
Well done, Marine.
[BOTH LAUGHING]
Ah.
Merry Christmas, Agent McGee.
Agent DiNozzo.
McGEE:
Hey, Breena.
- Merry Christmas.
Have you seen Jimmy or my dad?
They never came home last night.
[CHUCKLES]
Guess they got caught up in the case, huh?
ED:
What's going on?
- Yeah.
- What day is it?
- It's Christmas, Dad.
You didn't miss it.
Oh, boy.
They're back.
What's happening?
The lieutenant okay?
ED:
What about the baby?
They're at the hospital.
Mother and child are fine.
What?
They're okay?
Oh, look at that.
Cute little bugger.
Reminds me of you, baby.
- She's beautiful.
- She's beautiful.
[LAUGHS]
Ed, if you're still wondering why we put in so many long hours and make so many personal sacrifices...
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
And while I really appreciate the offer,
I'm very happy right here.
If that's what you want, and Breena is still willing to marry you despite...
- Dad.
- Yeah?
Stop.
Never.
Just don't spend too many nights here, son.
I want you two to have one of those someday.
Merry Christmas, you two.
Pretty pink bike, boss.
Nice tassels.
Yeah.
For Mike Franks' granddaughter.
Oh, I forgot.
Amira and Layla live in D.C. Now.
Of course.
So I guess you have somewhere else to be.
Yeah, well, so do you.
Ah.
I went.
Sat in the car for about 20 minutes debating.
I didn't go in.
Decided to swing by Casa de Gibbs instead.
Well, we all make our own choices, DiNozzo.
You think I made a mistake?
I think you made it twice now.
[HORN SQUEAKS THEN TONY CHUCKLES]
Well, when I joined NCIS, I knew what you expected of me.
Everything.
Doesn't exactly leave a lot of room for the Wendys of the world.
Did you come here to blame me, DiNozzo?
No, boss.
Good.
Family and job.
Two different cups.
That's right.
And if I couldn't fill both, that was my problem.
Mm-hm.
- What if I can now?
- Then get out of my basement.
- Man up and move on.
- Heh.
- Like you have?
- Don't be like me.
Learn from it.
Good talk.
[CHUCKLES]
Merry Christmas.
Hey, are you coming or not?
Layla is making lamb.
- You sure it's all right?
- Yeah.
I told her you were coming.
- When?
- I told her last week.
You're not gonna find what you're looking for down here, DiNozzo.

It's Christmas Eve.
Yes, it is, Tony.
And we drew the short straw.
We have to work.
So why are you smiling?
You did not tell us that Wendy sent you a Christmas card.
- Wendy who?
- Your Wendy.
- Baltimore Wendy.
- Your former fiancee Wendy.
Oh, yeah, that.
What are you doing reading my Christmas cards?
It was pinned on the wall behind your desk.
People usually do that so that others can enjoy them.
I thought you and Wendy haven't talked in...
Nine years.
What's your point?
So it says here that she and her ex-husband divorced last year.
I read that.
Too bad.
Very sad.
ZIVA:
And she invited you to Christmas brunch tomorrow with her and her seven-year-old son,
Fred.
Pretty cute.
So you going to go?
No.
I think I'll relegate that part of my life to Christmas past.
Huh.
Well, I get the impression that Wendy may be looking to try again with you.
- You think so?
JIMMY:
No, no, no, of course not.
I wouldn't dream of blowing him off, Breena.
I can't wait to hang out with your dad.
Yeah.
Okay, I-I'll call you later.
TONY:
Tiny Jim, to what do we owe this lovely sweater vest?
Thank you, Tony, for noticing.
It was a gift from Breena.
Actually, unfortunately, my gift to her should be arriving at any minute.
I agreed to give her father a tour of NCIS, while he's in town for the holidays.
Well, that is nice.
Actually, I thought Director Vance would nix the idea.
ZIVA:
You and Breena's dad do not get along?
The last time that Ed and I talked was when I asked for his permission to marry Breena.
He laughed.
And then he cried from laughing so hard.
Then he got really quiet.
So why is he coming here?
Breena wanted us to bond before the wedding.
She thinks that his main problem with me is my job.
Autopsy gremlin.
Yeah, if we could keep that kind of talk to a minimum while he's here?
I say it with the utmost respect.
I know that, I know that, but Ed doesn't.
You guys, he actually thinks that I'm stuck in some government job which pays too little and requires too many hours.
GIBBS:
You are.
Get off my desk.
Grab your gear.
Ah, yes.
Uh, duty calls.
So I'd better call Ed and cancel.
Hold on.
You're not going anywhere, Palmer.
Family first.
Nice sweater.

Merry Christmas, Palmer.

ZIVA:
Navy Captain Jake Marsden.
Stationed in Charleston, South Carolina.
According to his driver's license, he also lives there.
Tourist.
Desk clerk said he was in a hurry to get to his room.
For good reason, judging by those wounds.
Blood spatter indicates that he was standing about here when multiple gunshots went through him.
Looks like different calibers.
Multiple weapons.
Multiple shooters.
Guests did not hear anything that sounded like gunshots.
The gunmen must have used silencers and no fingerprints or evidence were left behind.
Pro job.
Humbug.
25 bucks for valet parking.
Highway robbery.
Actually, I wouldn't rule out a highway robbery.
Look at that-- passenger window's been blown out.
Bullet holes.
Looks like it's been sideswiped.
Valet said they found it this way.
That's what they always say, isn't it?
Hey, thought our dead guy was Navy.
You know, you never mentioned why you broke off the engagement with Wendy.
Who said I broke it off?
What, she leave you at the altar?
I didn't say that either.
Yahoo.
Marine sea bag-- women's bra.
Either our dead Navy captain was having an identity crisis, or he wasn't traveling alone.
Agent David, would you give me a hand in wrapping up the captain?
I was premature in giving Mr. Palmer the morning off.

If that's the hotel manager, tell him we won't take the body through his lobby.
- Gibbs.
The call's not coming from inside the hotel.
The area code-- that's northern Maryland.
WOMAN:
Jake, is that you?
What happened?
Well, I'd like to know the same thing.
You killed him, didn't you?
He's dead, but I didn't do it.
Who is this?
Who is this?
Are you a cop?
NCIS.
- Prove it.
- How?
If you are who you say, you'll figure it out.
Navy Captain Jake Marsden.
Single, no family, well liked.
But according to his unit, the only thing he made time for was his job.
Kind of sad, really.
Precisely why you should reconsider lunch with Wendy.
McGee and I searched
Marsden's car.
Nothing that I.D.'s the female travel companion.
Perhaps she was our mystery caller.
McGee, hotel phone records.
Prior to the murder, our victim made one outgoing phone call from the hotel room.
To a cell phone registered in his own name.
You track it?
- It's been turned off.
- Incoming to the room?
I already ran a back-trace.
- The call to the hotel came from...
JIMMY:
Hiya, team.
Just came to introduce my future father-in-law Ed Slater.
Is this a bad time?
Go ahead.
Okay.
Ed?
This... uh, Mr. Slater, this is our fearless leader,
Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
Over here we have Special Agent Anthony "Tony" DiNozzo.
Stop speaking, James.
I don't need their dossiers.
Only here for a few hours.
But what a pleasure.
Welcome to NCIS, Mr. Slater.
- Ah!
- Can't say enough about your future son-in-law and his work ethic here.
Yes, well, that's why I'm here, isn't it?
To make sure that if my daughter marries James, she gets him, not the bureaucratic baggage that comes with a government job, you know?
No.
- No?
- No.
I'm sorry, did you just say "if she marries him"?
Big if.
Let me ask you something, Special Super Agent Gibbs.
Are you the only team leader who makes his folks work Christmas Eve?
I guess when Uncle Sam calls you answer, even when he calls collect.
(chuckles) (nervous chuckle)
I think we've seen all we should in the squad room.
Why don't I show you...
anyplace else?
(whispers):
I'm so sorry.
He's a pleasant man.
McGee, phone call to the hotel.
Traced the number.
The call came from a courtesy phone at an outlet mall in Fillmore, Maryland.
That's two hours from here.
If our mystery woman was at the hotel, how did she get out there?
- Find her.
Find out.
Pulling mall security footage now.
DUCKY:
A visit to the national Christmas tree followed by a production of The Nutcracker at the Kennedy Center.
Sadly, Captain, your visit to D.C. was, well, much too brief to enjoy our city's holiday fare.
He always talk to himself?
Actually, Mr. Slater, I am conversing with our victim.
Well, it's a waste of time.
In my experience, the dead are dead.
And what experience would that be?
(stammers) Ed owns a funeral home.
I guess that is where Breena got her passion for embalming, huh?
- I always used to tell her...
- You're speaking again, James.
Uh, I'm a professional mortician, Dr. Mallard.
Then you should know that everybody has a unique story to tell if asked the right questions.
Maybe, but, uh, as much as you talk, this poor guy can hardly get a word in edgewise.
Huh?
(Jimmy laughs)
(chuckling)
I think it best if you two wait outside.
Yeah, I'll second that.
- Look, why...
- Motion carries.
Lot of things to see.
This is fun, huh?
Duck, what do you got?
Confirmation of cause of death.
And this-- when I took off the captain's clothes I found it stuffed deep in a pants pocket.
- Dried blood.
His?
That's up to Abby.
But apart from the bullet wounds which are fresh, there's no other exterior signs of trauma anywhere.
Blood could be from our missing woman.
Well, if it were, it would suggest that in addition to being on the run, she could also be wounded.

No, he's just being a...

That is her, calling the hotel.

No, but I think I know where she is.
Watch when she turns towards the camera.
"If you are who you say, you will figure it out."

Listen, everyone, I don't want any special treatment.
I'm a Marine first and pregnant second.
Oo-rah.

Well, I will gladly take the special treatment.

Who do you think I am, your elf?
Actually, I'll take one with marshmallows, too.
Thought you said you didn't want any special...
Extra marshmallows coming up.
So who is after you, Lieutenant?
I don't know.
Only ever been a squared-away Marine until eight and a half months ago.
I was stationed outside Kabul.
Our unit was training local Afghan soldiers.
One of them spoke English.
His name was Amir.
Things got romantic.
At least what passes for romantic in that hellhole.
Sand can get in some pretty inconvenient places.
- Any disciplinary action?
- I took responsibility.
C.O. made me forfeit two months pay and sent me stateside.
Thought that was it.
But?
Last week, I noticed I was being followed by a black SUV.
I would shake it, and then another one would show up.
Multiple people were following you?
Three men-- separate SUV's.
I got one of the license numbers.
It was registered to the Department of Defense.
- Call McGee.
Have him follow up.
- Mm-hmm.
So you skipped town with Marsden?
Jake's an old friend.
He offered to drive me to my parents' place in Ohio.
That's when things got crazy.
They followed you.
They tried to run us off the road.
I cut my hand when the window broke.
And we lost them.
But I started feeling woozy, so we went to the hotel.
When Jake didn't come down, I knew that I had to get out of there.
Why didn't you call the police?
If these guys were government, they would send local LEOs looking for us, too.
I don't know what this is about or how far up this goes.
Well, you can trust us.
Thank you.
Where's the father now?
McGEE:
The baby's father's dead?
Yes.
Amir Mayat died in an IED explosion back in May.
Says here, Lieutenant Reynolds went on leave after the incident.
What about the in-laws?
I mean, they must have some interest in the child.
According to her statement, she and Amir kept the pregnancy a secret from his family.
You know, Agent McGee, all of this is in her personnel file.
You don't need me to read it to you.
Hang on.
What is it you really want to know?
Is that file the only record DOD has on Lieutenant Reynolds?
- What do you mean?
- Someone's having her followed.
You think it's us?
We're DOD, not CIA.
We don't usually do that kind of thing.
Usually.
Why would we care what Reynolds does on her maternity leave?
We have reason to believe that three gunmen using vehicles registered to the DOD murdered a Navy captain and are now after the Lieutenant.
What are you suggesting?
Do you know how many vehicles we have registered in this city?
Thousands.
They get stolen all the time.
I'd be happy to check our database for you.
I understand that, sir, but you're not answering my question.
Is Lieutenant Reynolds on your radar?
Agent McGee, the only thing on my radar right now is Santa Claus.
I understand, sir.
But you will let us know if you find out anything on Lieutenant Reynolds?
Even if I did, I couldn't tell you without authorization.
Feliz Navidad.
Yeah, Abbs.
Gibbs, what are you still doing there?
The snow is falling faster than my holiday spirit.
There's a pregnant Marine being hunted on Christmas.
Heaven and nature are not singing.
Well, I'm waiting on intel and an escort from state troopers.
Just tell me what you got.
Background on Lieutenant Reynolds' baby daddy--
Amir Mayat-- and he is not a poor farmer.
The Mayat tribe controls a massive and critical land parcel just outside of Kabul.
- Family's wealthy.
Extremely.
And Amir was the sole male heir.
Until he was killed.
Yes.
And if Emma has a boy, then...
The kid inherits everything.
Practically royalty.
At least extremely valuable.
Well, that explains why the Lieutenant's still alive.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
They don't want her dead.
They want the baby alive.
It does not explain DOD's involvement.
McGEE:
This might, boss.
- What, McGee?
- I did some digging.
I tunneled under the DOD firewall.
Turns out U.S. military forces in Afghanistan are trying to build a trade highway through Mayat land.
It's vital for fighting insurgents and stopping weapons shipments.
ABBY:
And the tribal elders aren't cooperating.
Which is costing the DOD millions of dollars.
And if the project goes under, they lose even more.
Well, they need a bargaining chip.
The little baby heir.
By birthright, he'll be the head of the Mayat tribe.
They have the kid, they have the land.
Can we prove it?
Well, I still can't find anything concrete connecting the DOD and our three kings.
Keep looking.
(knocking)
How long have they been back there?
Not long enough.
Door.
I can't hear a word they're saying.
Well, if you hadn't made that remark about her tattoos, we wouldn't be in time out.
I still got six minutes left.
You do know that there are jobs in the private sector where you could make twice as much money and still be home by 6:00, right?
Hadn't really thought about that.
Well, maybe you should start.
And all I said to her was that girls with tattoos are easy.
Everyone knows that.
Is something wrong, Agent Gibbs?
- What did you find out?
- I'll tell you on the way out.
Car's out back, boss.
They started closing the highways.
It's not going to open till the morning.
Looks like we're on our own.
Back roads?
What if someone follows us?
Can't wait any longer.
I want a weapon.
You don't need one.
You got us.
Don't patronize me.
I was the top shot in my platoon.
You think Deputy Dog's ever seen actual combat?

A bit of advice.
Don't let the disparaging remarks of a myopic individual influence your life.

He said that Breena and I could work together.
Eventually take over the business.

Oh, and judging by the way he's punching and kicking me right now...
Come on.

I just wanted to be a Marine.
I guess someone else had other plans.
Yeah.
Wouldn't be the first time.
Do you have kids, Agent Gibbs?
Had a daughter.
Were you there when she was born?
Deployed.
Well, I guess I kind of have to be there for mine.
Not that I'm complaining.
It's just...
I might be...
Scared?

It's all right if you are.
Not according to the Corps.
That's what I like about being a Marine.

I could always tell how good I was doing, but with this... how do I know?
You don't.
But you'll be able to tell.
Mm.

Well... in that case...
Mmm!

Confirming hesitation.
No, no, I did not hesitate.
I don't know what you're talking about.

You've never committed a crime.
Your favorite color is pink.
You were hired by someone at the United States Department of Defense.

So you really are working for the government!
No.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Sure about that?
So then you must be working for the Mayat tribe in Afghanistan.

I'll take that as a yes.
No. (coughs) I just choke on cookie.
It does not mean anything.
Oh, it speaks volumes.
This is stupid!
You're just trying to mess with my head!
Then why are you getting so upset if it isn't true?
If the family hired you, then they must have found out about the baby.
They need an heir to keep their land.
Not the frosted cutouts.
I will stop eating cookies.

How are you communicating with your other two associates?
The only number stored on your contacts list is six numbers long.

Maybe it's something else.

MAN 2:
Not too far.
MAN 1:
Meet me.
Petrol station outside Ridgeville.
Now.
Sounds like Russians to me.
Searching for gas stations near Ridgeville, Maryland.
Pretty small town.
All right, I got a hit on a single service station alongside State Route 15.
Only one reason our gunmen would go there.
- Gibbs.
- Gibbs.
They're in trouble.
It could be where they're holed up.
JIMMY:
You find Agent Gibbs?
TONY:
That's what we're gonna find out.
Hey.
TONY:

Good luck.

Wh-Why?

It was pinned on the wall behind your desk.
People usually do that so that others can enjoy them.
I thought you and Wendy haven't talked in...
Nine years.
What's your point?
So it says here that she and her ex-husband divorced last year.

Too bad.
Very sad.

Navy Captain Jake Marsden.
Stationed in Charleston, South Carolina.
According to his driver's license, he also lives there.
Tourist.
Desk clerk said he was in a hurry to get to his room.
For good reason, judging by those wounds.
Blood spatter indicates that he was standing about here when multiple gunshots went through him.
Looks like different calibers.
Multiple weapons.
Multiple shooters.
Guests did not hear anything that sounded like gunshots.
The gunmen must have used silencers and no fingerprints or evidence were left behind.
Pro job.

Kind of sad, really.
Precisely why you should reconsider lunch with Wendy.
McGee and I searched
Marsden's car.
Nothing that I.D.'s the female travel companion.
Perhaps she was our mystery caller.
McGee, hotel phone records.
Prior to the murder, our victim made one outgoing phone call from the hotel room.
To a cell phone registered in his own name.
You track it?
- It's been turned off.
- Incoming to the room?
I already ran a back-trace.
- The call to the hotel came from...
- Hiya, team.
Just came to introduce my future father-in-law Ed Slater.
Is this a bad time?
Go ahead.
Okay.
Ed?
This... uh, Mr. Slater, this is our fearless leader,
Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
Over here we have Special Agent Anthony "Tony" DiNozzo.
Stop speaking, James.
I don't need their dossiers.
Only here for a few hours.
But what a pleasure.
Welcome to NCIS, Mr. Slater.
- Ah!
- Can't say enough about your future son-in-law and his work ethic here.
Yes, well, that's why I'm here, isn't it?
To make sure that if my daughter marries James, she gets him, not the bureaucratic baggage that comes with a government job, you know?
No.
- No?
- No.
I'm sorry, did you just say "if she marries him"?
Big if.
Let me ask you something, Special Super Agent Gibbs.
Are you the only team leader who makes his folks work Christmas Eve?
I guess when Uncle Sam calls you answer, even when he calls collect.
I think we've seen all we should in the squad room.
Why don't I show you...
anyplace else?
I'm so sorry.
He's a pleasant man.
McGee, phone call to the hotel.
Traced the number.
The call came from a courtesy phone at an outlet mall in Fillmore, Maryland.
That's two hours from here.
If our mystery woman was at the hotel, how did she get out there?
- Find her.
Find out.
Pulling mall security footage now.
A visit to the national Christmas tree followed by a production of The Nutcracker at the Kennedy Center.
Sadly, Captain, your visit to D.C. was, well, much too brief to enjoy our city's holiday fare.
He always talk to himself?
Actually, Mr. Slater, I am conversing with our victim.
Well, it's a waste of time.
In my experience, the dead are dead.
And what experience would that be?
Ed owns a funeral home.
I guess that is where Breena got her passion for embalming, huh?
- I always used to tell her...
- You're speaking again, James.
Uh, I'm a professional mortician, Dr. Mallard.
Then you should know that everybody has a unique story to tell if asked the right questions.
Maybe, but, uh, as much as you talk, this poor guy can hardly get a word in edgewise.
Huh?
I think it best if you two wait outside.
Yeah, I'll second that.
- Look, why...
- Motion carries.
Lot of things to see.
This is fun, huh?
Duck, what do you got?
Confirmation of cause of death.
And this-- when I took off the captain's clothes I found it stuffed deep in a pants pocket.
- Dried blood.
His?
That's up to Abby.
But apart from the bullet wounds which are fresh, there's no other exterior signs of trauma anywhere.
Blood could be from our missing woman.
Well, if it were, it would suggest that in addition to being on the run, she could also be wounded.

I don't know.
Only ever been a squared-away Marine until eight and a half months ago.
I was stationed outside Kabul.
Our unit was training local Afghan soldiers.
One of them spoke English.
His name was Amir.
Things got romantic.
At least what passes for romantic in that hellhole.
Sand can get in some pretty inconvenient places.
- Any disciplinary action?
- I took responsibility.
C.O. made me forfeit two months pay and sent me stateside.
Thought that was it.
But?
Last week, I noticed I was being followed by a black SUV.
I would shake it, and then another one would show up.
Multiple people were following you?
Three men-- separate SUV's.
I got one of the license numbers.
It was registered to the Department of Defense.
- Call McGee.
Have him follow up.
- Mm-hmm.
So you skipped town with Marsden?
Jake's an old friend.
He offered to drive me to my parents' place in Ohio.
That's when things got crazy.
They followed you.

Well, you can trust us.
Thank you.
Where's the father now?
The baby's father's dead?
Yes.
Amir Mayat died in an IED explosion back in May.
Says here, Lieutenant Reynolds went on leave after the incident.
What about the in-laws?
I mean, they must have some interest in the child.
According to her statement, she and Amir kept the pregnancy a secret from his family.
You know, Agent McGee, all of this is in her personnel file.
You don't need me to read it to you.
Hang on.
What is it you really want to know?
Is that file the only record DOD has on Lieutenant Reynolds?
- What do you mean?
- Someone's having her followed.
You think it's us?
We're DOD, not CIA.
We don't usually do that kind of thing.
Usually.
Why would we care what Reynolds does on her maternity leave?
We have reason to believe that three gunmen using vehicles registered to the DOD murdered a Navy captain and are now after the Lieutenant.
What are you suggesting?
Do you know how many vehicles we have registered in this city?
Thousands.
They get stolen all the time.
I'd be happy to check our database for you.
I understand that, sir, but you're not answering my question.
Is Lieutenant Reynolds on your radar?
Agent McGee, the only thing on my radar right now is Santa Claus.
I understand, sir.
But you will let us know if you find out anything on Lieutenant Reynolds?
Even if I did, I couldn't tell you without authorization.
Feliz Navidad.
Yeah, Abbs.
Gibbs, what are you still doing there?
The snow is falling faster than my holiday spirit.
There's a pregnant Marine being hunted on Christmas.
Heaven and nature are not singing.
Well, I'm waiting on intel and an escort from state troopers.
Just tell me what you got.
Background on Lieutenant Reynolds' baby daddy--
Amir Mayat-- and he is not a poor farmer.
The Mayat tribe controls a massive and critical land parcel just outside of Kabul.
- Family's wealthy.
Extremely.
And Amir was the sole male heir.
Until he was killed.
Yes.
And if Emma has a boy, then...
The kid inherits everything.
Practically royalty.
At least extremely valuable.
Well, that explains why the Lieutenant's still alive.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
They don't want her dead.
They want the baby alive.
It does not explain DOD's involvement.
This might, boss.
- What, McGee?
- I did some digging.
I tunneled under the DOD firewall.
Turns out U.S. military forces in Afghanistan are trying to build a trade highway through Mayat land.
It's vital for fighting insurgents and stopping weapons shipments.
And the tribal elders aren't cooperating.
Which is costing the DOD millions of dollars.
And if the project goes under, they lose even more.
Well, they need a bargaining chip.
The little baby heir.
By birthright, he'll be the head of the Mayat tribe.
They have the kid, they have the land.
Can we prove it?
Well, I still can't find anything concrete connecting the DOD and our three kings.
Keep looking.
How long have they been back there?
Not long enough.
Door.
I can't hear a word they're saying.
Well, if you hadn't made that remark about her tattoos, we wouldn't be in time out.
I still got six minutes left.
You do know that there are jobs in the private sector where you could make twice as much money and still be home by 6:00, right?
Hadn't really thought about that.
Well, maybe you should start.
And all I said to her was that girls with tattoos are easy.
Everyone knows that.
Is something wrong, Agent Gibbs?
- What did you find out?
- I'll tell you on the way out.
Car's out back, boss.

Eventually take over the business.

But I want to make Breena happy.

Russian mercenaries want to take my unborn child because he's the only heir to land in Afghanistan?

I-I left a couple of bucks on the register.
Felt weird just to take it.
Hey.
Don't worry about it;
it's gonna be fine.
This is not exactly the Christmas Eve that I had planned on, Agent Gibbs.
Actually, I hadn't planned on any of this.
Amir... the baby... people trying to steal him.
Him?
I thought you said you didn't know.
I don't, but I can tell.
Oh, and judging by the way he's punching and kicking me right now...
Come on.
...I think he's gonna be a Marine, too.
- Sit down.
- Whew.
I just wanted to be a Marine.
I guess someone else had other plans.
Yeah.
Wouldn't be the first time.
Do you have kids, Agent Gibbs?
Had a daughter.
Were you there when she was born?
Deployed.
Well, I guess I kind of have to be there for mine.
Not that I'm complaining.
It's just...
I might be...
Scared?
The hell you say?
It's all right if you are.
Not according to the Corps.
That's what I like about being a Marine.
The procedures.
The code.
I like having a measurable set of expectations.
I could always tell how good I was doing, but with this... how do I know?
You don't.
But you'll be able to tell.
Mm.
Right now, I think this guy is telling me that it's time to eat.
Well... in that case...
Mmm!
This one's on me.
Thank you.
You know, Wendy used to make the most kick-ass snickerdoodle.
I'm going to start with a series of true or false statements
Mm-hmm.
to give us a baseline.
What are you talking about?
Just think of it as like a lie detector test with cookies.
You just have to sit there and eat.
Okay, here we go.
Your hair is purple.
You have all your fingers.
You were following Lieutenant Emma Reynolds with the intention of abducting her baby.
Oh, hesitation.
I see the hesitation.
- Yeah, he did.
- Yeah.
Confirming hesitation.
No, no, I did not hesitate.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You sure about that?
You've never committed a crime.
Your favorite color is pink.
You were hired by someone at the United States Department of Defense.
So you really are working for the government!
No.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Sure about that?
So then you must be working for the Mayat tribe in Afghanistan.
I'll take that as a yes.
- No.
- I just choke on cookie.
It does not mean anything.
Oh, it speaks volumes.
This is stupid!
You're just trying to mess with my head!
Then why are you getting so upset if it isn't true?
If the family hired you, then they must have found out about the baby.
They need an heir to keep their land.
Not the frosted cutouts.
I will stop eating cookies.
Your prepaid cell we found on you.
How are you communicating with your other two associates?
The only number stored on your contacts list is six numbers long.
You're always missing a couple of digits, aren't you?
Well, maybe that's not a mistake.
Maybe it's something else.
Coordinates?
Code?
Password?
Radio frequency?
Radio frequency.
I'm gonna go with radio frequency.
You will never get it now.
We wrote it down, genius.
If they're using radio systems, we should be able to pick up some chatter.
Okay, try it.
Hey.
Try it again.
Given the parts available, this could prove to be a problem.
Aah... that's not our only problem.
My water just broke.
I'm going into labor.
Ooh-rah?
It's good to know you no longer think the government's hunting a pregnant woman, Agent DiNozzo, but I'm afraid
I can't help you apprehend the Afghan in-laws that are.
It is Christmas Eve, sir.
Well, that gift would have to come from CENTCOM and about 14 other people above my pay grade.
Yeah.
Let me guess-- it'd be wrapped in red tape?
Thanks for nothing.
Got something from our gunman's radio frequency.
And given the weak signal, they got to be at least 40 miles away.
- Where are you?
- Not too far.
Meet me.
Petrol station outside Ridgeville.
Now.
Sounds like Russians to me.
Searching for gas stations near Ridgeville, Maryland.
Pretty small town.
All right, I got a hit on a single service station alongside State Route 15.
Only one reason our gunmen would go there.
- Gibbs.
- Gibbs.
They're in trouble.
It could be where they're holed up.
You find Agent Gibbs?
That's what we're gonna find out.
Hey.
Put it in gear, McGee.
Good luck.
Yeah.
Good luck.
Why in the world would you say it like that?
Wh-Why?
The weather, the road closures, 'cause they're never gonna make it.
How the hell would you know?
They're trained agents.
Well...
You might not respect me or what it is we do here, but you have got to respect that fact that these people-- my people-- are risking their lives!
Well, if you're gonna put it like that...
There's no other way to put it.
Till you can figure that out, we're not going anywhere.
Sit down and shut up.
The last two were less than a minute apart.
It didn't hurt this much when I took shrapnel in Mosul.
The whole harness must be sautéed.
Fried.
Oh...
Oh, boy, the baby's coming!
Gibbs.
We have company.
What do you want to do?
Defend our position.
You stay with the lieutenant;
I'll draw fire.
Don't you leave me, Gibbs.
I need someone to tell me how I'm doing.
You're doing fine.
I'm not so sure.
Are you asking for special treatment, Marine?
Sir, yes, sir.
Just this once.
Hey, Gibbs?
It's okay.
Got this covered.
Thank you.
You might want to hold off on that.

You did not tell us that Wendy sent you a Christmas card.
- Wendy who?

- Baltimore Wendy.
- Your former fiancee Wendy.
Oh, yeah, that.
What are you doing reading my Christmas cards?
It was pinned on the wall behind your desk.
People usually do that so that others can enjoy them.
I thought you and Wendy haven't talked in...
Nine years.
What's your point?
So it says here that she and her ex-husband divorced last year.
I read that.
Too bad.
Very sad.
And she invited you to Christmas brunch tomorrow with her and her seven-year-old son,

Pretty cute.

Well, that is nice.
Actually, I thought Director Vance would nix the idea.

He laughed.
And then he cried from laughing so hard.
Then he got really quiet.

Breena wanted us to bond before the wedding.
She thinks that his main problem with me is my job.
Autopsy gremlin.
Yeah, if we could keep that kind of talk to a minimum while he's here?

Navy Captain Jake Marsden.
Stationed in Charleston, South Carolina.
According to his driver's license, he also lives there.
Tourist.
Desk clerk said he was in a hurry to get to his room.
For good reason, judging by those wounds.
Blood spatter indicates that he was standing about here when multiple gunshots went through him.
Looks like different calibers.
Multiple weapons.
Multiple shooters.
Guests did not hear anything that sounded like gunshots.
The gunmen must have used silencers and no fingerprints or evidence were left behind.
Pro job.

You know, you never mentioned why you broke off the engagement with Wendy.
Who said I broke it off?

Navy Captain Jake Marsden.
Single, no family, well liked.

Kind of sad, really.
Precisely why you should reconsider lunch with Wendy.
McGee and I searched
Marsden's car.
Nothing that I.D.'s the female travel companion.
Perhaps she was our mystery caller.
McGee, hotel phone records.
Prior to the murder, our victim made one outgoing phone call from the hotel room.
To a cell phone registered in his own name.
You track it?
- It's been turned off.
- Incoming to the room?
I already ran a back-trace.
- The call to the hotel came from...
- Hiya, team.
Just came to introduce my future father-in-law Ed Slater.
Is this a bad time?
Go ahead.
Okay.
Ed?
This... uh, Mr. Slater, this is our fearless leader,
Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
Over here we have Special Agent Anthony "Tony" DiNozzo.
Stop speaking, James.
I don't need their dossiers.
Only here for a few hours.
But what a pleasure.
Welcome to NCIS, Mr. Slater.
- Ah!
- Can't say enough about your future son-in-law and his work ethic here.
Yes, well, that's why I'm here, isn't it?
To make sure that if my daughter marries James, she gets him, not the bureaucratic baggage that comes with a government job, you know?
No.
- No?
- No.
I'm sorry, did you just say "if she marries him"?
Big if.
Let me ask you something, Special Super Agent Gibbs.
Are you the only team leader who makes his folks work Christmas Eve?
I guess when Uncle Sam calls you answer, even when he calls collect.
I think we've seen all we should in the squad room.
Why don't I show you...
anyplace else?
I'm so sorry.
He's a pleasant man.
McGee, phone call to the hotel.
Traced the number.
The call came from a courtesy phone at an outlet mall in Fillmore, Maryland.
That's two hours from here.
If our mystery woman was at the hotel, how did she get out there?
- Find her.
Find out.
Pulling mall security footage now.
A visit to the national Christmas tree followed by a production of The Nutcracker at the Kennedy Center.
Sadly, Captain, your visit to D.C. was, well, much too brief to enjoy our city's holiday fare.
He always talk to himself?
Actually, Mr. Slater, I am conversing with our victim.
Well, it's a waste of time.
In my experience, the dead are dead.
And what experience would that be?
Ed owns a funeral home.
I guess that is where Breena got her passion for embalming, huh?
- I always used to tell her...
- You're speaking again, James.
Uh, I'm a professional mortician, Dr. Mallard.
Then you should know that everybody has a unique story to tell if asked the right questions.
Maybe, but, uh, as much as you talk, this poor guy can hardly get a word in edgewise.
Huh?
I think it best if you two wait outside.
Yeah, I'll second that.
- Look, why...
- Motion carries.
Lot of things to see.
This is fun, huh?
Duck, what do you got?
Confirmation of cause of death.
And this-- when I took off the captain's clothes I found it stuffed deep in a pants pocket.
- Dried blood.
His?
That's up to Abby.
But apart from the bullet wounds which are fresh, there's no other exterior signs of trauma anywhere.
Blood could be from our missing woman.
Well, if it were, it would suggest that in addition to being on the run, she could also be wounded.

So who is after you, Lieutenant?
I don't know.
Only ever been a squared-away Marine until eight and a half months ago.
I was stationed outside Kabul.
Our unit was training local Afghan soldiers.
One of them spoke English.
His name was Amir.
Things got romantic.
At least what passes for romantic in that hellhole.
Sand can get in some pretty inconvenient places.
- Any disciplinary action?
- I took responsibility.
C.O. made me forfeit two months pay and sent me stateside.
Thought that was it.
But?
Last week, I noticed I was being followed by a black SUV.
I would shake it, and then another one would show up.
Multiple people were following you?
Three men-- separate SUV's.
I got one of the license numbers.
It was registered to the Department of Defense.
- Call McGee.
Have him follow up.
- Mm-hmm.
So you skipped town with Marsden?
Jake's an old friend.
He offered to drive me to my parents' place in Ohio.
That's when things got crazy.
They followed you.
They tried to run us off the road.

Well, you can trust us.
Thank you.
Where's the father now?
The baby's father's dead?
Yes.
Amir Mayat died in an IED explosion back in May.
Says here, Lieutenant Reynolds went on leave after the incident.
What about the in-laws?
I mean, they must have some interest in the child.
According to her statement, she and Amir kept the pregnancy a secret from his family.
You know, Agent McGee, all of this is in her personnel file.
You don't need me to read it to you.
Hang on.
What is it you really want to know?
Is that file the only record DOD has on Lieutenant Reynolds?
- What do you mean?
- Someone's having her followed.
You think it's us?
We're DOD, not CIA.
We don't usually do that kind of thing.
Usually.
Why would we care what Reynolds does on her maternity leave?
We have reason to believe that three gunmen using vehicles registered to the DOD murdered a Navy captain and are now after the Lieutenant.
What are you suggesting?
Do you know how many vehicles we have registered in this city?
Thousands.
They get stolen all the time.
I'd be happy to check our database for you.
I understand that, sir, but you're not answering my question.
Is Lieutenant Reynolds on your radar?
Agent McGee, the only thing on my radar right now is Santa Claus.
I understand, sir.
But you will let us know if you find out anything on Lieutenant Reynolds?
Even if I did, I couldn't tell you without authorization.
Feliz Navidad.
Yeah, Abbs.
Gibbs, what are you still doing there?
The snow is falling faster than my holiday spirit.
There's a pregnant Marine being hunted on Christmas.
Heaven and nature are not singing.
Well, I'm waiting on intel and an escort from state troopers.
Just tell me what you got.
Background on Lieutenant Reynolds' baby daddy--
Amir Mayat-- and he is not a poor farmer.
The Mayat tribe controls a massive and critical land parcel just outside of Kabul.
- Family's wealthy.
Extremely.
And Amir was the sole male heir.
Until he was killed.
Yes.
And if Emma has a boy, then...
The kid inherits everything.
Practically royalty.
At least extremely valuable.
Well, that explains why the Lieutenant's still alive.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
They don't want her dead.
They want the baby alive.
It does not explain DOD's involvement.
This might, boss.
- What, McGee?
- I did some digging.
I tunneled under the DOD firewall.
Turns out U.S. military forces in Afghanistan are trying to build a trade highway through Mayat land.
It's vital for fighting insurgents and stopping weapons shipments.
And the tribal elders aren't cooperating.
Which is costing the DOD millions of dollars.
And if the project goes under, they lose even more.
Well, they need a bargaining chip.
The little baby heir.
By birthright, he'll be the head of the Mayat tribe.
They have the kid, they have the land.
Can we prove it?
Well, I still can't find anything concrete connecting the DOD and our three kings.
Keep looking.
How long have they been back there?
Not long enough.
Door.
I can't hear a word they're saying.
Well, if you hadn't made that remark about her tattoos, we wouldn't be in time out.
I still got six minutes left.
You do know that there are jobs in the private sector where you could make twice as much money and still be home by 6:00, right?
Hadn't really thought about that.
Well, maybe you should start.
And all I said to her was that girls with tattoos are easy.
Everyone knows that.
Is something wrong, Agent Gibbs?
- What did you find out?
- I'll tell you on the way out.
Car's out back, boss.
They started closing the highways.
It's not going to open till the morning.
Looks like we're on our own.

But I want to make Breena happy.
Doctor... what if this is the only way?

Russian mercenaries want to take my unborn child because he's the only heir to land in Afghanistan?

You guys are still here, huh?
Huh.
Well, I'm Ed's ride, and technically I'm still on duty, so...
Duty.
Hey.
Any word from Gibbs?
Not yet.
What do you think's taking them so long?
I don't know.
We left separately.
Must have taken a different route.
Could have hit bad weather.
Did you try calling him?
Abby's been calling his cell every five minutes.
Nothing.
And the land lines are down from here to Baltimore due to ice.
Lucky we still have Internet.
Find anything to finger our fingerless man?
I ran his remaining prints.
Name is Veli Tupolev.
No record in the States but Interpol's a different story.
Let me guess-- a trained mercenary who's used to hard Russian winters and even harder Russian prisons?
Pretty much.
How do you want to break him?
Well...
What?
I was hungry.
Didn't know I'd be held hostage.
Wait a second.
Are those Hollander's homemade Christmas cookies from HR?
Did she make molasses this year?
She did, and they were good.
We're gonna need to commandeer these.
Police business.
I think I have a way to break our Bad Santa.
With what, cookies?
What are you gonna do, sugarboard him?
Thought you said they were pros.
Injector rail was damaged.
Fuel leaked into the manifold and caught fire.
Yeah, I'm gonna have to try and redo some wiring.
I'll see what they got.
Mm-hmm.
The phones are still out, but I'll keep checking.
Or if you want any help in there,
I know my way around a car.
Well, sit down.
Rest.
Have some fluids.
No.
I already did.
I-I left a couple of bucks on the register.
Felt weird just to take it.
Hey.
Don't worry about it;
it's gonna be fine.
This is not exactly the Christmas Eve that I had planned on, Agent Gibbs.
Actually, I hadn't planned on any of this.
Amir... the baby... people trying to steal him.
Him?
I thought you said you didn't know.
I don't, but I can tell.
Oh, and judging by the way he's punching and kicking me right now...
Come on.
...I think he's gonna be a Marine, too.
- Sit down.
- Whew.
I just wanted to be a Marine.
I guess someone else had other plans.
Yeah.
Wouldn't be the first time.
Do you have kids, Agent Gibbs?
Had a daughter.
Were you there when she was born?
Deployed.
Well, I guess I kind of have to be there for mine.
Not that I'm complaining.
It's just...
I might be...
Scared?
The hell you say?
It's all right if you are.
Not according to the Corps.
That's what I like about being a Marine.
The procedures.
The code.
I like having a measurable set of expectations.
I could always tell how good I was doing, but with this... how do I know?
You don't.
But you'll be able to tell.
Mm.
Right now, I think this guy is telling me that it's time to eat.
Well... in that case...
Mmm!
This one's on me.
Thank you.
You know, Wendy used to make the most kick-ass snickerdoodle.
I'm going to start with a series of true or false statements
Mm-hmm.
to give us a baseline.
What are you talking about?
Just think of it as like a lie detector test with cookies.
You just have to sit there and eat.
Okay, here we go.
Your hair is purple.
You have all your fingers.
You were following Lieutenant Emma Reynolds with the intention of abducting her baby.
Oh, hesitation.
I see the hesitation.
- Yeah, he did.
- Yeah.
Confirming hesitation.
No, no, I did not hesitate.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You sure about that?
You've never committed a crime.
Your favorite color is pink.
You were hired by someone at the United States Department of Defense.
So you really are working for the government!
No.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Sure about that?
So then you must be working for the Mayat tribe in Afghanistan.
I'll take that as a yes.
- No.
- I just choke on cookie.
It does not mean anything.
Oh, it speaks volumes.
This is stupid!
You're just trying to mess with my head!
Then why are you getting so upset if it isn't true?
If the family hired you, then they must have found out about the baby.
They need an heir to keep their land.
Not the frosted cutouts.
I will stop eating cookies.
Your prepaid cell we found on you.
How are you communicating with your other two associates?
The only number stored on your contacts list is six numbers long.
You're always missing a couple of digits, aren't you?
Well, maybe that's not a mistake.
Maybe it's something else.
Coordinates?
Code?
Password?
Radio frequency?
Radio frequency.
I'm gonna go with radio frequency.
You will never get it now.
We wrote it down, genius.
If they're using radio systems, we should be able to pick up some chatter.
Okay, try it.
Hey.
Try it again.
Given the parts available, this could prove to be a problem.
Aah... that's not our only problem.
My water just broke.
I'm going into labor.
Ooh-rah?
It's good to know you no longer think the government's hunting a pregnant woman, Agent DiNozzo, but I'm afraid
I can't help you apprehend the Afghan in-laws that are.
It is Christmas Eve, sir.
Well, that gift would have to come from CENTCOM and about 14 other people above my pay grade.
Yeah.
Let me guess-- it'd be wrapped in red tape?
Thanks for nothing.
Got something from our gunman's radio frequency.
And given the weak signal, they got to be at least 40 miles away.
- Where are you?
- Not too far.
Meet me.
Petrol station outside Ridgeville.
Now.
Sounds like Russians to me.
Searching for gas stations near Ridgeville, Maryland.
Pretty small town.
All right, I got a hit on a single service station alongside State Route 15.
Only one reason our gunmen would go there.
- Gibbs.
- Gibbs.
They're in trouble.
It could be where they're holed up.
You find Agent Gibbs?
That's what we're gonna find out.
Hey.
Put it in gear, McGee.
Good luck.
Yeah.
Good luck.
Why in the world would you say it like that?
Wh-Why?
The weather, the road closures, 'cause they're never gonna make it.
How the hell would you know?
They're trained agents.
Well...
You might not respect me or what it is we do here, but you have got to respect that fact that these people-- my people-- are risking their lives!
Well, if you're gonna put it like that...
There's no other way to put it.
Till you can figure that out, we're not going anywhere.
Sit down and shut up.
The last two were less than a minute apart.
It didn't hurt this much when I took shrapnel in Mosul.
The whole harness must be sautéed.
Fried.

What do you want to do?
Defend our position.
You stay with the lieutenant;
I'll draw fire.
Don't you leave me, Gibbs.
I need someone to tell me how I'm doing.
You're doing fine.
I'm not so sure.
Are you asking for special treatment, Marine?
Sir, yes, sir.
Just this once.
Hey, Gibbs?
It's okay.
Got this covered.
Thank you.
You might want to hold off on that.

It was pinned on the wall behind your desk.
People usually do that so that others can enjoy them.

Nine years.

So it says here that she and her ex-husband divorced last year.
I read that.
Too bad.
Very sad.

Huh.

Well, that is nice.
Actually, I thought Director Vance would nix the idea.

The last time that Ed and I talked was when I asked for his permission to marry Breena.
He laughed.
And then he cried from laughing so hard.
Then he got really quiet.
So why is he coming here?
Breena wanted us to bond before the wedding.

Stationed in Charleston, South Carolina.
According to his driver's license, he also lives there.
Tourist.
Desk clerk said he was in a hurry to get to his room.
For good reason, judging by those wounds.
Blood spatter indicates that he was standing about here when multiple gunshots went through him.
Looks like different calibers.
Multiple weapons.
Multiple shooters.
Guests did not hear anything that sounded like gunshots.
The gunmen must have used silencers and no fingerprints or evidence were left behind.
Pro job.

To make sure that if my daughter marries James, she gets him, not the bureaucratic baggage that comes with a government job, you know?
No.

Big if.

Are you the only team leader who makes his folks work Christmas Eve?

The call came from a courtesy phone at an outlet mall in Fillmore, Maryland.
That's two hours from here.

Sadly, Captain, your visit to D.C. was, well, much too brief to enjoy our city's holiday fare.

Actually, Mr. Slater, I am conversing with our victim.
Well, it's a waste of time.
In my experience, the dead are dead.
And what experience would that be?

So who is after you, Lieutenant?
I don't know.
Only ever been a squared-away Marine until eight and a half months ago.
I was stationed outside Kabul.
Our unit was training local Afghan soldiers.
One of them spoke English.
His name was Amir.
Things got romantic.
At least what passes for romantic in that hellhole.
Sand can get in some pretty inconvenient places.
- Any disciplinary action?
- I took responsibility.
C.O. made me forfeit two months pay and sent me stateside.
Thought that was it.
But?
Last week, I noticed I was being followed by a black SUV.
I would shake it, and then another one would show up.
Multiple people were following you?
Three men-- separate SUV's.
I got one of the license numbers.
It was registered to the Department of Defense.
- Call McGee.
Have him follow up.
- Mm-hmm.

Amir Mayat died in an IED explosion back in May.
Says here, Lieutenant Reynolds went on leave after the incident.
What about the in-laws?
I mean, they must have some interest in the child.
According to her statement, she and Amir kept the pregnancy a secret from his family.
You know, Agent McGee, all of this is in her personnel file.
You don't need me to read it to you.
Hang on.
What is it you really want to know?
Is that file the only record DOD has on Lieutenant Reynolds?
- What do you mean?
- Someone's having her followed.
You think it's us?
We're DOD, not CIA.
We don't usually do that kind of thing.
Usually.
Why would we care what Reynolds does on her maternity leave?
We have reason to believe that three gunmen using vehicles registered to the DOD murdered a Navy captain and are now after the Lieutenant.
What are you suggesting?
Do you know how many vehicles we have registered in this city?
Thousands.
They get stolen all the time.
I'd be happy to check our database for you.
I understand that, sir, but you're not answering my question.
Is Lieutenant Reynolds on your radar?
Agent McGee, the only thing on my radar right now is Santa Claus.
I understand, sir.
But you will let us know if you find out anything on Lieutenant Reynolds?
Even if I did, I couldn't tell you without authorization.
Feliz Navidad.
Yeah, Abbs.

Heaven and nature are not singing.
Well, I'm waiting on intel and an escort from state troopers.
Just tell me what you got.
Background on Lieutenant Reynolds' baby daddy--
Amir Mayat-- and he is not a poor farmer.
The Mayat tribe controls a massive and critical land parcel just outside of Kabul.
- Family's wealthy.
Extremely.
And Amir was the sole male heir.
Until he was killed.
Yes.
And if Emma has a boy, then...
The kid inherits everything.
Practically royalty.
At least extremely valuable.
Well, that explains why the Lieutenant's still alive.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
They don't want her dead.
They want the baby alive.
It does not explain DOD's involvement.
McGEE:
This might, boss.
- What, McGee?
- I did some digging.
I tunneled under the DOD firewall.
Turns out U.S. military forces in Afghanistan are trying to build a trade highway through Mayat land.
It's vital for fighting insurgents and stopping weapons shipments.
ABBY:
And the tribal elders aren't cooperating.
Which is costing the DOD millions of dollars.
And if the project goes under, they lose even more.
Well, they need a bargaining chip.
The little baby heir.
By birthright, he'll be the head of the Mayat tribe.
They have the kid, they have the land.
Can we prove it?
Well, I still can't find anything concrete connecting the DOD and our three kings.
Keep looking.

How long have they been back there?
Not long enough.
Door.
I can't hear a word they're saying.
Well, if you hadn't made that remark about her tattoos, we wouldn't be in time out.
I still got six minutes left.
You do know that there are jobs in the private sector where you could make twice as much money and still be home by 6:00, right?
Hadn't really thought about that.
Well, maybe you should start.
And all I said to her was that girls with tattoos are easy.
Everyone knows that.
Is something wrong, Agent Gibbs?
- What did you find out?
- I'll tell you on the way out.
Car's out back, boss.
They started closing the highways.
It's not going to open till the morning.

NCIS.
Let him go.
Give me the woman!
No, it's not going to happen.
I don't want to hurt him.
GIBBS:
I know exactly what you want.
Drop your weapon.
MAN:
You are in no position to make demands.
I'm not, but she is.
(gun cocking)
Unless you want to die today, put it down.
Now!
DiNozzo, you and the deputy take him back.
We got the Lieutenant.
TONY:
All right, meet you back at the Navy yard.
On it, boss.
What's that all about?
Hedge trimmer accident?
- Proof.
- Of what?
Nerve.
Initiation ritual common in Russian prison gangs.
Any of your other friends missing fingers?
You will see for yourself.
What does that mean?
Means we're getting the hell out of here.
Watch your head.
(wind whistling)
(phone ringing nearby)
Ah, there you are.
I hear the team is on its way back with a suspect.
Have you heard anything more?
No.
Just been waiting on Ed.
What's the matter, Mr. Palmer?
- Just a bit overwhelmed,
- I guess.
My own father was only ever encouraging to me no matter what I did.
And Ed, Ed is like
Ebenezer Scrooge at the beginning of the book.
A bit of advice.
Don't let the disparaging remarks of a myopic individual influence your life.
See, that's just it.
He finally said something nice to me.
Really?
He offered me a job at his funeral home.
He said that Breena and I could work together.
Eventually take over the business.
Really?
Is that what you want?
Me?
No.
No, I love NCIS.
But I want to make Breena happy.
Doctor... what if this is the only way?
Breena will be happy if you are happy.
Tell that to Mister Ed.
(car engine revving)
Russian mercenaries want to take my unborn child because he's the only heir to land in Afghanistan?
We believe the gunmen may have been hired by someone inside the government.
Why?
Because that land may be key in winning or losing Afghanistan.
(sighing):
I'm starting to understand why Amir distanced himself from his family.
(loud bang)
What happened?
(engine sputtering) Is it the engine?
The Russians.
There is no signal out here.
There's a light up ahead.
(engine sputtering)
(hissing)
Oh, God.
Ugh!
Do you think we can fix it?
I don't think we've got a choice.
I saw a garage around back.
I'll help push.
Don't push.
(computer key clicks)
(crunching and chewing sounds)
(phones ringing nearby)
(papers rustling)
You guys are still here, huh?
Huh.
Well, I'm Ed's ride, and technically I'm still on duty, so...
Duty.
TONY:
Hey.
Any word from Gibbs?
Not yet.
What do you think's taking them so long?
I don't know.
We left separately.
Must have taken a different route.
Could have hit bad weather.
Did you try calling him?
Abby's been calling his cell every five minutes.
Nothing.
And the land lines are down from here to Baltimore due to ice.
Lucky we still have Internet.
Find anything to finger our fingerless man?
I ran his remaining prints.
Name is Veli Tupolev.
No record in the States but Interpol's a different story.
Let me guess-- a trained mercenary who's used to hard Russian winters and even harder Russian prisons?
Pretty much.
How do you want to break him?
Well... (crunching)
What?
I was hungry.
Didn't know I'd be held hostage.
(chuckles)
Wait a second.
Are those Hollander's homemade Christmas cookies from HR?
Did she make molasses this year?
She did, and they were good.
We're gonna need to commandeer these.
Police business.
I think I have a way to break our Bad Santa.
With what, cookies?
What are you gonna do, sugarboard him?
Thought you said they were pros.
(door latch rattles)
(rattling)
(light switch clicks on)
Injector rail was damaged.
Fuel leaked into the manifold and caught fire.
Yeah, I'm gonna have to try and redo some wiring.
I'll see what they got.
Mm-hmm.
(phone clicking)
EMMA:
The phones are still out, but I'll keep checking.
Or if you want any help in there,
I know my way around a car.
Well, sit down.
Rest.
Have some fluids.
No.
I already did.
I-I left a couple of bucks on the register.
Felt weird just to take it.
(wind whistling)
GIBBS:
Hey.
Don't worry about it;
it's gonna be fine.
This is not exactly the Christmas Eve that I had planned on, Agent Gibbs.
Actually, I hadn't planned on any of this.
Amir... the baby... people trying to steal him.
Him?
I thought you said you didn't know.
I don't, but I can tell.
(laughs)
Oh, and judging by the way he's punching and kicking me right now...
Come on.
...I think he's gonna be a Marine, too.
- Sit down.
- Whew.
I just wanted to be a Marine.
I guess someone else had other plans.
Yeah.
Wouldn't be the first time.
Do you have kids, Agent Gibbs?
Had a daughter.
Were you there when she was born?
Deployed.
Well, I guess I kind of have to be there for mine.
Not that I'm complaining.
It's just...
I might be...
Scared?
The hell you say?
It's all right if you are.
Not according to the Corps.
That's what I like about being a Marine.
The procedures.
The code.
I like having a measurable set of expectations.
I could always tell how good I was doing, but with this... how do I know?
You don't.
But you'll be able to tell.
Mm.
Right now, I think this guy is telling me that it's time to eat.
Well... in that case...
Mmm!
This one's on me.
(chuckles)
Thank you.
(crunching)
You know, Wendy used to make the most kick-ass snickerdoodle.
I'm going to start with a series of true or false statements
Mm-hmm.
to give us a baseline.
What are you talking about?
Just think of it as like a lie detector test with cookies.
You just have to sit there and eat.
Okay, here we go.
Your hair is purple.
(crunching)
You have all your fingers.
You were following Lieutenant Emma Reynolds with the intention of abducting her baby.
Oh, hesitation.
I see the hesitation.
- Yeah, he did.
- Yeah.
Confirming hesitation.
No, no, I did not hesitate.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You sure about that?
You've never committed a crime.
Your favorite color is pink.
You were hired by someone at the United States Department of Defense.
(laughing)
So you really are working for the government!
No.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Sure about that?
So then you must be working for the Mayat tribe in Afghanistan.
(choking)
(coughing)
(stifling cough)
I'll take that as a yes.
No. (coughs) I just choke on cookie.
It does not mean anything.
Oh, it speaks volumes.
This is stupid!
You're just trying to mess with my head!
Then why are you getting so upset if it isn't true?
If the family hired you, then they must have found out about the baby.
They need an heir to keep their land.
Not the frosted cutouts.
I will stop eating cookies.
Your prepaid cell we found on you.
How are you communicating with your other two associates?
The only number stored on your contacts list is six numbers long.
You're always missing a couple of digits, aren't you?
(chuckling)
Well, maybe that's not a mistake.
Maybe it's something else.
Coordinates?
Code?
Password?
Radio frequency?
Radio frequency.
(smashing phone)
I'm gonna go with radio frequency.
You will never get it now.
We wrote it down, genius.
If they're using radio systems, we should be able to pick up some chatter.
(Tony mutters)
Okay, try it.
(starter cranking, engine sputtering)
Hey.
(sighs wearily)
(groaning)
Try it again.
(starter cranking, engine sputtering)
Given the parts available, this could prove to be a problem.
EMMA:
Aah... that's not our only problem.
My water just broke.
I'm going into labor.
Ooh-rah?
It's good to know you no longer think the government's hunting a pregnant woman, Agent DiNozzo, but I'm afraid
I can't help you apprehend the Afghan in-laws that are.
It is Christmas Eve, sir.
Well, that gift would have to come from CENTCOM and about 14 other people above my pay grade.
Yeah.
Let me guess-- it'd be wrapped in red tape?
Thanks for nothing.
Got something from our gunman's radio frequency.
And given the weak signal, they got to be at least 40 miles away.
MAN 1:
Where are you?
MAN 2:
Not too far.
MAN 1:
Meet me.
Petrol station outside Ridgeville.
Now.
Sounds like Russians to me.
Searching for gas stations near Ridgeville, Maryland.
Pretty small town.
All right, I got a hit on a single service station alongside State Route 15.
Only one reason our gunmen would go there.
- Gibbs.
- Gibbs.
They're in trouble.
It could be where they're holed up.
JIMMY:
You find Agent Gibbs?
TONY:
That's what we're gonna find out.
Hey.
TONY:
Put it in gear, McGee.
Good luck.
(sarcastically):
Yeah.
Good luck.
Why in the world would you say it like that?
Wh-Why?
The weather, the road closures, 'cause they're never gonna make it.
How the hell would you know?
They're trained agents.
Well...
You might not respect me or what it is we do here, but you have got to respect that fact that these people-- my people-- are risking their lives!
Well, if you're gonna put it like that...
There's no other way to put it.
Till you can figure that out, we're not going anywhere.
Sit down and shut up.
(engine clicking)
The last two were less than a minute apart.
It didn't hurt this much when I took shrapnel in Mosul.
The whole harness must be sautéed.
Fried.
Oh...

What do you want to do?
Defend our position.

You stay with the lieutenant;
I'll draw fire.
EMMA:
Don't you leave me, Gibbs.
I need someone to tell me how I'm doing.
You're doing fine.
I'm not so sure.
(Emma panting)
Are you asking for special treatment, Marine?
Sir, yes, sir.
Just this once.
ZIVA:
Hey, Gibbs?
It's okay.
Got this covered.

Thank you.

You might want to hold off on that.

== sync, corrected by elderman ==
There was once upon a time a town, not far from a big city.
A road ran through, but there were only a few businesses.
A coffee shop, a hardware store, a sheriff's office.
And all kinds of people..
vagrants, runaway teens... religious fanatics, retired seniors who ... well, it was a town of those who want to be left alone... and so they were.
Sheriff, Bobby LaGrange, had been there for years... also made wood novelties.
But the most astonishing thing about the town was ... an old belfry, that had a clock tower with seven faces.
You could see the time from anywhere in the town of Swann Valley.
the faces persistently told different times.
No question, something evil was abiding there.
Perhaps it was because of the terrible murder that happened years before.
Too terrible to talk about.
But which haunted the town.
Or perhaps it was those teenagers who gathered across the lake.
Some people thought they did bad things.
Worshiped Satan.
The way they dressed, the music they played... and their mysterious leader known only as Flamingo.
A seducer of innocent youth... and some said...far worse.
It was at this certain time...
that a third string writer... of popular fiction, Hall Baltimore ... drove into Swann Valley.
On his book signing tour... of another of his series of novels ... about witchcraft.
Excuse me, do you know where the bookstore is?
There's no bookstore around here.
- Great.
Have you ever read a Hall Baltimore thriller?
No, thanks.
Have you ever read Hall Baltimore thriller?
No...
Who is Hall Baltimore?
I am he.
- Oh.
Nice to meet you.
and you are ...
- Stacey.
Oh excuse me, sorry.
- Hi Stacey. bye Stacey.
Hey.
- Hey.
You sell weapons?
Uh, no weapons, just ammunition.
- Pistols?
Ammunition?
- Yes.
Knives?
- Isle 2.
The Hall Baltimore.
I'll take one.
Could you uh...autograph it?
- sure.
To Bobby LaGrange.
To Bobby LaGrange.
Best witches.
Hall Baltimore.
How does it feel to be the bargain basement Stephen King?
Not too wonderful.
Well, you know, I uh, I write horror stories myself.
You don't say?
And you're the sheriff here in the town?
40 years.
You wouldn't uh, or Would you, mind reading some of my stuff?
I'd be much obliged.
You know We had a mass murder.
A while back.
A lot of folks think the town's haunted
Well, I'm, I'm uh, just wrapping it up here in the town... and then I'm gonna be on my way.
You a mystery writer and you're not interested in mass murder?
.
No.
you come with me right now... and take a look at the doozie I got in the morgue
You got a doozie in the morgue?
- Yes sir.
now?
- Yes, sir.
There's a story in it.
I know what this must look like ...
- It is like a wood...
Ow!
Jesus!
.
Let me ask you a question.
How long have you worked here?
- Well
You don't run a gurney with a dead person on over my foot!
Sorry, sheriff.
Is this a common occurrence in Swann Valley?
- Tt's happened before.
serial killing it appears to be leaves a calling card as a wooden stake.
I don't want to see her face.
- I don't blame you.
I mean, it's really a tragedy.
She's just a poor girl.
Arbus?
- Yeah?
Arbus!
Alright, alright.
- You're on the clock.
Do you know who she is?
- This girl?
We get all kind here vagrants, runaways..
worse, those kids out at the lake.
All kinds.
How'd you like to calobrate on a book about this?
You and me?
Are you gonna...
leave that stake in her like that?
Howdy.
I'd Like to fill my thermos full of coffee, please.
- Okay
Edgar Allan Poe slept in this town?
Sure did.
- At the old Chickering Hotel way back when.
Chickering Hotel...
Thanks.
- Have a good day.
With my respect sir.
I want to write something I do.
I want to write something for me.
something personal.
Does that make any sense?
I have to break the spell of this downward spiral.
There's only one way to do it and I'm trying to do it.
I'm not gonna write another witch book.
I told them that...and, and, and that's it, I'm gonna do something for me.
You've done it before
When you weren't drinking.
Before Vicky's accident.
I can't rush these things.
You can do this.
I...
I know what...
I know what you mean about you just have to do it one more time.
Just...
write the damn thing, then you can, then you can take the time and write what you really want to write.
I understand, I get it. you know I do.
Did you call Sam?
Did you tell him we need an advance?
Well I did and it was extremely humiliating.
And I'm not gonna write another witch story.
You're having a holiday?
- No Im...
and I'm stuck here
- Listen to me trying to put people off ... come up wiith magic numbers...
to make it all work out.
Pretend there's nothing wrong and put food on the table.
- Denise will you listen to me?
You can't, you can't speak to me like this... just grow up ...grow up!
People always ask me, "How do you know so much about witches?"... and I tell them, "'Cuz I married one."
Hey.
- Hello.
Where do you come from?
Just down the road.
You past me.
You looking at my teeth?
No I'm not, I just didn't know where you came from.
I am very self conscious about my buck teeth.
Show me.
Your teeth are fine.
It's those braces.
Anyway I hate them.
- No, they're fine.
You'll grow into them.
They call me Vampira, because of these teeth.
but you can call me V..
- V. that's nice.
What's your real name?
- Virginia.
Virginia.
You're about 13?
Yeah, I'm 12.
But I look older because I'm tall.
I know who you are.
You wrote those witch stories.
And you're here to sign books over at the hardware store.
I love your books.
Especially the part where Elizabeth says,
"Forsake me never, for I will entice you from my grave."
That's my favorite part.
Thanks, I like your look.
Oh ...yeah.
It's just the way I dress.
You scared of me yet?
- What?
Yes.
A little.
That clock it chimed midnight three times already.
Keeping track of time around here is pointless.
That's why I missed your book signing.
Well that old hotel is open.
Come on I'll buy you a soda...sweetie
I have a girl your age.
No, I don't think that a particularly good idea.
- Why not?
That's what I had to go to the hardware store and talk about.
My story.
Well tell it to me now.
- No, I can't.
Come on.
We're open.
Come in.
I...went for walk, I guess I got lost.
Hey what happened to that little girl?
- What little girl?
Is the restaurant open?
- Restaurant's always open.
What with that old clock tower and all those faces, you can get breakfast anytime.
Yes.
Well, Mr...
- Baltimore.
Damned clock.
That clock has never told the correct time.
Just you wait.
You're gonna be very surprised.
Bell's the important thing, and it's working beautifully.
Better than before.
- I'll just uh, have a beer.
Melvin is the belfry custodian, assigned to the big clock at church.
It's a hopeless job.
And a real burden.
That old mechanism's on it's last legs .
I go up there about every day, or most.
Those seven faces they look at me like I was the one who invented daylight savings time.
You know who came up with daylight savings time, don't you?
Hitler.
And, you know who supports it now?
Doctors.
And you know why?
Golf.
They want more time to golf.
That's what it's all about.
You can't change time.
Time changes you.
Don't you agree?
What's your position on daylight savings time?
I've never really thought about it.
- What have you been thinking about?
That's the grave.
- Grave?
Oh you can walk on it.
Don't worry.
The whole floor is a grave.
It is?
- There are twelve children buried right down there.
13 children murdered in cold blood.
Well, actually he's right.
It is an even dozen, but one got away and she was damned.
When was that?
- Oh, a long Time ago.
The clock is fixed.
The clock is fixed.
Ha, the clock is fixed.
The clock is fixed.
Got you, devil.
She drew blood.
- Suck it out...suck it out, suck it out.
Goddamn her...
- Hey write it down.
What time did she bite you?
4 o'clock.
- It isn't 4 o'clock.
The clock says four o'clock.
- You've got to be kidding me?
She's the devil.
It's the dead little kids.
You?
Why are you here?
what has she told you?
- Nothing.
What should she tell me?
Go away, old man...you know what you did.
Children...hurry.
The moon is going down...
time for nap.
Come on.
Come along now, come on.

do you know how much it's worth?
- Yeah, I do.
160,000 dollars.
No, it's worth a lot more than that.
It's priceless.
you shouldn't even be touching it.
How did you get into my safe?
Just calm down.
please stop, just, just, whatever you're doing, just stop and put it down.
That's really not a joke..
you think it's.
I don't think it's funny.
It's a nice book though eh?
Yes, Whitman only had... there's only four of those in private hands okay.
Do you understand what that means?
Do you..
He set the type himself.
- Do you think I'm joking?
please.
- you know what...
I think you care more this old book than you do your own family.
You need the gloves for that.
- You Know what?
Get the advance or you can kiss it good bye.
Please.
- Don't make me have to do this.
I don't want to...
I have to.
Hello.

So, you're the sheriff and you make bat houses?
Yes, and that's a bird house.
Totally different. .
The bats and the birds know which is which.
Weell normally I write about witchcraft but ... what are vampires but witches that suck blood.
Entirely different.
We haven't really had one here.
There are no witches here, since as long as I can remember.
I could ask my sister.
She's older than Hades.
Welcome to my office.

- Calm` down.
Tell me what you got.
Shoot.
I call it, The Vampire Executions... and that will sell.
Not bad.
Go on.
The girl, who is she?
is she just a runaway?
Or just some 12 or 13 year old girl ... that looks much older than she really is.
A Vagrant?
Homeless?
Why the wooden stake?
- Yeah, why?
What, did that kill her?
Or was it something that was added later?
As a calling card for the real killer?
You see, one end of it was worn smooth.
No fingerprints.
And then it was pressed into her...slowly.
Not jab, not stab.
Almost as if it was done by some kind of a machine.
A machine?
- Yeah.
That's why I call it The Vampire Executions.
I think she was killed by ...an electric chair ... for vampires.
An execution device, designed especially by and for vampires.
That's different...
I wonder what that would look like.
Well I thought of that.
I made a model.
Ready?
- Ready
How about that?
Watch this.
You love it?
How can I help you, Hall.
- Hey Sam ... remember you said if I come with a bulletproof idea, you'd give me an advance?
Another advance.
- Yeah, another, more.
A bulletproof idea comes with meat on the bone.
Not a lot of fog on the lake kind of crap, you know.
Yeah, well no one can mix metaphors quite like you Sam.
Here's the title, right...just listen The Vampire Executions.
vampires huh?
And the main character get this...
she's a little girl, a murdered girl.
Beautiful.
- Beautiful, yeah, but she's just a kid.
No, no, no, I meant it's beautiful that she gets murdered.
But it's gotta have a lot of story.
Not a lot of style bullshit.
So tell me, how does this execution bit play out?
I, I will find out.
I, I mean there's a great...great twist ending.
With heart.
With tons of heart, and I'll get you a complete outline in the morning.
But you gotta get me a check to Denise right away.
I'm not kidding around, in fact, in fact the bank wire transfer would be better.
It's an emergency
You know, you know, I'm thinking, it's not bulletproof.
But Hall Baltimore, master OF witchcraft doing a vampire story...
It's not bad.
- Not bad at all.
If it's got an ending.
- It's got an ending.
A bulletproof ending.
- Bulletproof
But Sam, you gotta tide my wife over okay?
This is why I'm doing it alright?
25 grand.
Okay, you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna wire Denise 10,000 dollars.
25.
That, that's great.
I really appreciate it.
As I said, I'm gonna wire Denise 10,000 dollars... but I need the outline in the morning or I'm gonna stop payment.
Sam?
- And no fog on the lake.
The night was ... humid.
The night was ... cloudy.
Fog.
A Mist ...a mist descends ... on the, on the lake Mini, Mini, Mini ...
Unwanipanuki.
The fog ... floated out like
Virginia's silent ... dream.
No, that sucks.
The fog on the lake, the fog on the ...
The fog on the lake ... just to torture Sam.
The scent floats out like ... tears.
On a whale's ass?
No.
The fog on the lake...the flake.
The straight edge razor.
The fog on the lake reminds me of my first wife.
It dissipated with time.
I'd lost my mind.
And now I have a lisp.
And now I'm suddenly turning into a black basketball player.
she ... was ...
I/m typing as a gay basketball player from the sixties.
I like short shorts.
They are revealing, but it's confortable.
It helps me jump.
There was no fog on the lake.
Swann Valley, sheriff's department.
Deputy Arbus speaking.
Arbus, the writer fella told me to go do a bunch of errands for him... well, he's not back here at his motel.
If you see him, tell him I'll wait another thirty minutes... and that's it...
I got to go.
- Alright, sheriff.
Why isn't the door locked, Arbus?
Yeah, I left it open for you, PJ.
what happened to your diet?
- I was wondering when you were gonna get here with my hamburgers.
Feel like to playing some cards?
sure, but when are you gonna pay up?
Hey PJ, get the chord there woould you.
- Okay. .
Don't ever walk into a morgue like that unannounced.
My heart can't handle it.
- Sorry, I knocked.
Yeah, well, sheriff's over at your motel ... and he said I'll only be here another thirty minutes.
Okay, thanks.
You owe me eighteen bucks, Arbus.
Snooze, Ropopose, Sleep all ...
Night all ... and you didn't put this on your list.
But I liked it.
I thought it was good.
Sleeping All.
- Just what I needed.
Are we gonna work on this together?
That is, what you said.
These are just goanna put you to sleep.
A chance to dream.
But you didn't read the label's.
- Yes I did.
This is how you write?
I thought that all city writers... just got sauced and then wrote in some kind of trance
- We do...we do but...
There is a bulletproof ending out there and I know just the guy to get me there ...
Hey do you know a doctor in town that can give me prescription for a real..real one?
I can't do that.
I'm a public official.
Twilight Lights.
By Bobby LaGrange.
Her skin was as fresh as cream, floating up from butter ... under the lace negligee she liked to teasee me with.
What keeps bringing you back here?
I'm trying to solve a mystery.
I'm waiting for you, my friend.
Here, by her tomb.
After you.
- Thank you.
And you are...
Edgar Allan Poe, so..if you...
How can I help?
well...
I don't have no ending.
Did you know the deacons once corresponded with me ... concerning the technique ...
of writing the ending first.
And working backwards.
What did you need?
Length?
40 to 50 lines ... per page.
200 page minimum.
Providence?
- Beauty.
The tone?
- They'll tell you.
These points being settled... shall we consider the reframe?
- I like it.
The bell tower is becoming to me.
A reframe must be brief.
In my own work, my most famous... it's lead me at once to a single word is the best...
I'm afraid.
Never more.
The difficulty arose from the presumption that the word ... must be monopolously be spoken by a human being.
then immediately arose the idea of a, a non reasoning creature capable of speech ... and, then very naturally a parrot suggested itself.
But it was superceded forthwith immediately by a raven as equally ... capable of speech, but as a bird of ill omen ... infinitely more in keeping within intent to turn.
Is all this worth the price of that very good bottle of Irish whisky?
Yes, of course, please continue..
So, I asked myself ... of all the melancholy topics ... what according to the universal understanding of mankind is the most tragic?
Death.
And when is this most tragic of melancholy topics... most poetical?
When it most loosely alludes itself ... to beauty.
The death therefore, of a beautiful girl ..
is unquestionly the most poetical topic in the world.
Equally it is beyond there that the lips best suited for the topic are those of the man ...
who loved her.
So ...
I had to combine these two ideas ... of the lover lamented his deceased mistress ... and the raven' continuously using the word "Nevermore"
in a poem of about 100 lines.
And "nevermore" of conclusion of each dancer... in a poem of melancholy tone.
How do you uh, find the ending?
Your story is a tragedy.
It happened here at the old Chikering hotel where I once slept.
There were many children in the town.
Orphans some wares, the lost children.
And before long they were taking in to protection of pastor Alan Floyd.
He was a kindly man, loved his kids.
And everyone agreed that he took very good care of them.
He taught them cataclysm, and love of god and goodness.
And one night it happened.
One of his children was missing.
And that's when it came out.
Who isn't here?
Peter?
Where did... he didn't go across the lake.
Never ever go with the people across of the lake.
This is very important.
They are like, like, like...vermin.
Unclean, those, those fiends across the lake.
They are ... the undead..
They are vampires.
He took care of them and fed them.
Anointed them with the juices of spoilage, and sinkfoil and wolfsbane.
Anointed them against evil.
Turn your head.
- Thank you..
That's right.
There we go.
Make sure that you be nice and safe.
Someday you will wearing ... nylon stockings.
Where the hell is he?
- What are you doing with my mom's Ouija board?
Have you ever seen one of these?
- What would you do with that?
Innovation is what made the detective story and Charlie Chan entertaining.
Bobby LaGrange ...
is an innovative detective.
After you, sir.
That, ouija board.
We are in close proximity... to the deceased.
And the killer is probably still in the area.
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this in a morgue.
Dim the old lights..
Hello.
Do we know you?
- Yes, it is.
You're doing that, I can feel you.
No I'm not
- Shut up!
H..
I..
M.
Him.
It wants you
Okay, do we know you?
I... am ... her.
I am.
Arbus, what was that?
Ask her, let go watch.
Who killed you?
B...
Sheriff, you're doing that.
I can feel it.
- Am not.
Who killed you?
B...
The evil kids at the lake.
They are evil.
And that Flamingo kid, he's the one that infects them.
He's a vampire.
Is he?
'Yes'.
Come on, Arbus.
Keep your gun hidden.
You must be thirsty?
- Exactly
I'm looking for Flamingo.
- He is right back here.
When the sky is low and heavy, weighing as a lid ... on the groaning spirit, falling prey to long boredom...
Educated.. you know BAUDELAIRE.
I know life man.
And I know the dreams of BAUDELAIRE.
and he from the horizon, the entire circle embracing... a dark day for our poor, even sadder than the nights.
I was hoping you could help me find this missing girl.
She is 12 or 13.
There are a lot of girls here.
You know, people are saying what's going on up here is...evil.
Are you worried about that?
Look around you.
Does this look evil to you?
Look at that moon.
It is beautiful.
I have been worried ... it has been 3 days since we've seen her..
She's just a little kid that I take care of, but I'm worried that something has happened to her.
Arbus.
Damn it.
You?
You're out off uniform?
And you're here on unofficial business.
What the hell are you doing here?
he said you were okay with it.
He gave me 20 bucks.
Mr. Collaborator.
I thought we were a team, all the way through this investigation.
Bobby LaGrange does not like to be tricked.
Nor does he like being made a fool out of.
The famous Flamingo ..my..my..my the lady killer.
Arbus, arrest this murderer.
He's like that...either coming or going.
Or he's already gone.
Those are the real keys for the...
- These are them .... these are the official keys.
- Wow, that's amazing.
This is to the clock tower?
- Yes, really?
Hey give me, give me that.
Where are you going with that?
Come on, just to see.
- What?
You don't want to go up there.
That's odd, I was up here yesterday ... and I didn't have a hard time with this lock at all.
- Yesterday?
Uh, maybe it was last week.
It worked?
- Maybe it was the week before last.
Let me try.
Here.
- Thanks.
What the hell was that?
You tell me you ever notice anything like that when you were up here?
You're not going up there.
This place is haunted.
Didn't you know that?
What's that smell?
- The devil.
The devil lives up there.
You're gonna get it all over yourself.
I'm going out.
Goodbye.
come with us daddy...
come with us daddy
Help me, daddy...
Come with us daddy.
Help me...
Help me...daddy
listen,
- What is that?
Are they evil?
No.
No.
tell me who killed her?
...tell me.
You say that you want to know..
but do you?
I want to know the truth.
- There are consequences.
What choice do I have?
Tell me all of the story.
- As you wish, my friend.
There happened events just make you ashamed to remember.
Please.
- Thank you, it's a sharp of knife.
I wanna know what the secret ingredient is.
We're going to have special lemonade for everybody.
That's right...good job.
This stuff stinks.
- Careful.
You cut your finger.
Here you go, Alice.
-Thank you.
You're welcome.
There you go.
- Don't drink the lemonade, he put something in it.
No, stop.
- No I would like `lemonade, Virginia
Virginia, fine.
Enough, ..stand still.
Virginia, is being very...
very sick.
And we're all going to have some lemonade, it's delicious and sweet...taste it.
Stay...stay...stay here.
- What are you doing?
Then he made a fateful decision.
Rather than have his children's souls be damned as vampires he drugged their lemonade, and slit their throats.
Can you make him stop?
Do something..
Death of beauty.
One child tried to save herself.
Virginia?
You're playing our favorite game, huh?
I'll find you.
Got you.
Virginia.
Virginia.
One way to God.
One, one, one way to God.
I got you.
Once the monster caught her he put her in chains in the vault.
No.
You must stop screaming.
I told you...
God wants you to meet mom.
That's right. scream all what you want,
Even God can't hear you now.
One road, one way to God..
All in Jesus name.
During the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty...
I loved her..
not as the living and breathing Virginia ... but as the Virginia of the dream.
You see ... dear friend ... she was my young cousin ... my beloved wife.
her name was Virginia.
but I gave her many names.
Lenor
Bernice.
The lady Gaia.
Madenasha.
Annabelle Lee.
Alianora.
I assume that I am your partner?
...
Open the door, wake up.
Wake up.
Open the door, Hall.
- Alright, alright..hang on.
Wait 'til you see this.
- What?
I subscribed to "Writers Weekly."
and this just in... says that you took a 10,000 dollar advance on a project called "The Vampire Executions."
No, no.. that was money for some old writes.
And that money already went to my wife.
that's a mistake.
But I was thinking, I do like "The Vampire Executions"... by Hall Baltimore and Bobby LaGrange.
give me my $5,000 dollar now.
There's not gonna be any money exchanged until we get to the story right?
We gotta get to the end.
- The end?
The end?
It's a who done it.
Like every other murder mystery.
Just let me wake up.
- It comes to who did it.
Okay.
- What's the matter with you?
You're foregoing your greatest asset.
- Yeah..what's that?
Bobby LaGrange, the detective..
You gotta take Bobby LaGrange and use him much more throughout the entire story ... because he could solve the crime himself..
clearly it's the work of a serial killer.
Someone wants to silence the girls, on the other side of the lake.
because, they fried a sick mind.
And then they sizzle them, because of some psyco hocus pocus condition... that condemns them to being the evil sluts that they are.
And that is what's in a sick mind.
You think so, Bobby?
You think they're uh, they're evil sluts?
whom?
- The young girls.
Shit yes, they're all into dark things... every one of them they worship death...
and sex.
What do you think?
Oh no you don't...
No, not Bobby LaGrange...
them.
Those devil worshiping whores on the other side of the loch.
Shit Yes, they are all in dark thing every one of them.
They worship death and sex.
They were just too saucy for their own good.
You know, they have that white flash with the devil inside them.
That little spice you can't stop, thinking about.
It's not me.
- It's not me.
It's them.
- It's the... flash of the devil.
I saved their souls
You... you don't touch me.
Do not touch me. tearing it out.
Old, old bastard.
- Forgive me... forgive me for seeking pleasure outside of the company ... cast me another way for my spirit.
perhaps, it takes the dirt to be boiled, only here alone?
With all of these things together, thrown ... will burn it ...
- Flame-proof, bullet-proof.
I can't even look at the cliff, without trembling.
This little cliff?
Wait, wait.
Do you dare to go further?
- What are you talking about, tell me the ending.
If you don't stop now, every word ..
that flows from your pen will be your your own tale.
You.
You are the ending you seek.
How can I stop now when it's so close to the end?
Then it's time to face the truth.
To end this story, there is no other way.
I am so ashamed, I should cry That's my little girl.
That's my daughter.
She wanted me to go with her friends.
I thought they were little boats....
I thought they were childrens boats.
I didn't know they were speedboats.
I couldn't guide them.
I was too drunk to wake up that morning.
I was with a woman.
I am so ashamed.
I could have gone, I set the clock, but it was the wrong time So the alarm didn't go off.
I could have been there ...but been there, maybe still...
I'm so ashamed... so ashamed.
Than maybe if I would have been there she would...
I could have been there, I should have been there.
This little girl.
We share this little ghost, my friend.
Our work must be the grave that we prepare for it's lovely tenant.
Oh God ...
Help me...help me, Daddy..
'Bullet Proof'.
You delivered the goods here.
I'm telling you, meat on the bone.
You think so, Sam?
- I do.
Hall Baltimore, master of witchcraft, no more.
Never more.
There was once upon a time a town, not far from a big city.
A road ran through, but there were only a few businesses.
A coffee shop, a hardware store, a sheriff's office.
And all kinds of people..
vagrants, runaway teens... religious fanatics, retired seniors who ... well, it was a town of those who want to be left alone... and so they were.
Sheriff, Bobby LaGrange, had been there for years.
Also made wood novelties.
But the most astonishing thing about the town was ... an old belfry, that had a clock tower with seven faces.
You could see the time from anywhere in the town of Swann Valley.
The faces persistently told different times.
No question, something evil was abiding there.
Perhaps it was because of the terrible murder that happened years before.
Too terrible to talk about.
But which haunted the town.
Or perhaps it was those teenagers who gathered across the lake.
Some people thought they did bad things.
Worshiped Satan.
The way they dressed, the music they played.
And their mysterious leader known only as Flamingo.
A seducer of innocent youth... and some said...far worse.
It was at this certain time...
that a third string writer... of popular fiction, Hall Baltimore ... drove into Swann Valley.
On his book signing tour... of another of his series of novels ... about witchcraft.
Excuse me, do you know where the bookstore is?
There's no bookstore around here.
- Great.
Have you ever read a Hall Baltimore thriller?
No, thanks.
Have you ever read a Hall a Baltimore thriller?
No...
Who is Hall Baltimore?
I am he.
- Oh.
Nice to meet you.
And you are ...
- Stacey.
Oh excuse me, sorry.
- Hi Stacey. bye Stacey.
Hey.
- Hey.
You sell weapons?
Uh, no weapons, just ammunition.
- Pistols?
Ammunition?
- Yes.
Knives?
- Isle 2.
The Hall Baltimore.
I'll take one.
Could you uh...autograph it?
- sure.
To Bobby LaGrange.
To Bobby LaGrange.
Best witches.
Hall Baltimore.
How does it feel to be the bargain basement Stephen King?
Not too wonderful.
Well, you know, I uh, I write horror stories myself.
You don't say?
And you're the sheriff here in the town?
40 years.
You wouldn't uh, or Would you, mind reading some of my stuff?
I'd be much obliged.
You know We had a mass murder.
A while back.
A lot of folks think the town's haunted
Well, I'm, I'm uh, just wrapping it up here in the town... and then I'm gonna be on my way.
You a mystery writer and you're not interested in mass murder?
.
No.
You come with me right now... and take a look at the doozie I got in the morgue
You got a doozie in the morgue?
- Yes sir.
Now?
- Yes, sir.
There's a story in it.
I know what this must look like ...
- It is like a wood...
Ow!
Jesus!
.
Let me ask you a question.
How long have you worked here?
- Well
You don't run a gurney with a dead person on it over my foot!
Sorry, sheriff.
Is this a common occurrence in Swann Valley?
- It's happened before.
Serial killing it appears to be leaves a calling card as a wooden stake.
I don't want to see her face.
- I don't blame you.
I mean, it's really a tragedy.
She's just a poor girl.
Arbus?
- Yeah?
Arbus!
Alright, alright.
- You're on the clock.
Do you know who she is?
- This girl?
We get all kinds here vagrants, runaways..
worse, those kids out at the lake.
All kinds.
How'd you like to calobrate on a book about this?
You and me?
Are you gonna...
leave that stake in her like that?
Howdy.
I'd Like to fill my thermos full of coffee, please.
- Okay
Edgar Allan Poe slept in this town?
Sure did.
- At the old Chickering Hotel, way back when.
Chickering Hotel...
Thanks.
- Have a good day.
With my respect sir.
I want to write something I do.
I want to write something for me.
something personal.
Does that make any sense?
I have to break the spell of this downward spiral.
There's only one way to do it and I'm trying to do it.
I'm not gonna write another witch book.
I told them that...and, and, and that's it, I'm gonna do something for me.
You've done it before
When you weren't drinking.
Before Vicky's accident.
I can't rush these things.
You can do this.
I...
I know what...
I know what you mean about you just have to do it one more time.
Just...
write the damn thing, then you can, then you can take the time and write what you really want to write.
I understand, I get it. you know I do.
Did you call Sam?
Did you tell him we need an advance?
Well I did and it was extremely humiliating.
And I'm not gonna write another witch story.
You're having a holiday?
- No Im...
I and I'm stuck here
- Listen to me trying to put people off.
I'm going...
Come up with magic numbers...
to make it all work out.
Pretend there's nothing wrong and put food on the table.
- Denise will you listen to me?
You can't, you can't speak to me like this... just grow up ...grow up!
People always ask me, "How do you know so much about witches?"... and I tell them, "'Cuz I married one."
Hey.
- Hello.
Where do you come from?
Just down the road.
You past me.
You looking at my teeth?
No I'm not, I just didn't know where you came from.
I am very self conscious about my buck teeth.
Show me.
Your teeth are fine.
It's those braces.
Anyway I hate them.
- No, they're fine.
You'll grow into them.
They call me Vampira, because of these teeth.
But you can call me V..
- V. That's nice.
What's your real name?
- Virginia.
Virginia.
You're about 13?
Yeah, I'm 12.
But I look older because I'm tall.
I know who you are.
You wrote those witch stories.
And you're here to sign books over at the hardware store.
I love your books.
Especially the part where Elizabeth says,
"Forsake me never, for I will entice you from my grave."
That's my favorite part.
Thanks, I like your look.
Oh...yeah.
It's just the way I dress.
You scared of me yet?
- What?
Yes.
A little.
That clock it chimed midnight three times already.
Keeping track of time around here is pointless.
That's why I missed your book signing.
Well that old hotel is open.
Come on I'll buy you a soda...sweetie
I have a girl your age.
No, I don't think that's a particularly good idea.
- Why not?
That's what I had to go to the hardware store and talk to you about.
My story.
Well tell it to me now.
- No, I can't.
Come on.
We're open.
Come in.
I...went for walk, I guess I got lost.
Hey what happened to that little girl?
- What little girl?
Is the restaurant open?
- Restaurant's always open.
What with that old clock tower and all those faces, you can get breakfast anytime.
Yes.
Well, Mr...
- Baltimore.
Damned clock.
That clock has never told the correct time.
Just you wait.
You're gonna be very surprised.
Bell's the important thing, and it's working beautifully.
Better than before.
- I'll just uh, have a beer.
Melvin is the belfry custodian, assigned to the big clock at church.
It's a hopeless job.
And a real burden.
That old mechanism's on it's last legs .
I go up there about every day, or most.
Those seven faces they look at me like I was the one who invented daylight savings time.
You know who came up with daylight savings time, don't you?
Hitler.
And, you know who supports it now?
Doctors.
And you know why?
Golf.
They want more time to golf.
That's what it's all about.
You can't change time.
Time changes you.
Don't you agree?
What's your position on daylight savings time?
I've never really thought about it.
- What have you been thinking about?
That's the grave.
- Grave?
Oh you can walk on it.
Don't worry.
The whole floor is a grave.
It is?
- There are twelve children buried right down there.
13 children murdered in cold blood.
Well, actually he's right.
It is an even dozen, but one got away and she was damned.
When was that?
- Oh, a long Time ago.
The clock is fixed.
The clock is fixed.
Ha, the clock is fixed.
The clock is fixed.
Got you, devil.
She drew blood.
- Suck it out...suck it out, suck it out.
Goddamn her...
- Hey Write it down.
What time did she bite you?
4 o'clock.
- It isn't 4 o'clock.
The clock says four o'clock.
- You've got to be kidding me?
She's the devil.
It's the dead little kids.
You?
Why are you here?
what has she told you?
- Nothing.
What should she tell me?
Go away, old man...you know what you did.
Children...hurry.
The moon is going down...
time for nap.
Come on.
Come along now, come on.
my God, I'm lost.
Maybe this is what I need, ...this story.
Where are you going?
Help me.
You?
My God...
Edgar Poe.
Show me the way.
Hall, wake up.
Are you, I know you're there.
Are you awake?
- What?
It wasn't me.
It's me.
This is your wife.
Hello?
Hall, wake up.
Are you, I know you're there.
What's the matter?
- Are you awake?
It's me.
What's the matter?
Everything okay?
This is your wife.
Yeah, I know who you are.
I didn't, well...
I need a second.
What's, oh my God.
What have you done?
Yeah?
That?
Do you know how much it's worth?
- Yeah, I do.
160,000 dollars.
No, it's worth a lot more than that.
It's priceless.
You shouldn't even be touching it.
How did you get into my safe?
Just calm down.
Please stop, just, just, whatever you're doing, just stop and put it down.
That's really not a joke.
you think it's.
I don't think it's funny.
It's a nice book though eh?
Yes, Whitman only had... there's only four of those in private hands okay.
Do you understand what that means?
Do you?
He set the type himself.
- Do you think I'm joking?
Please.
- You know what...
I think you care more this old book than you do your own family.
You need the gloves for that.
- You Know what?
Get the advance or you can kiss it good bye.
Please.
- Don't make me have to do this.
I don't want to...
I have to.
Hello.
I'm looking for ...
- Mrs. LaGrange is sleeping.
Quiet.
Oh, sorry.
I'd like to know if you have any information on the old Chickering Hotel?
I'll check the files.
Thank you.
Swann Valley, Sheriff's office please.
One moment.
Your number is 393 229 39 23 .
do you wish to be connected?
Yes.
Sheriff's office, we're closed.
Yes, hi, it's me, You remember me, the writer.
I'm here at the window.
I'm gonna go to the front door.
Alright.
We're closed.
- Can I talk to you?
Look sheriff says nothing happens as long as that thing is in here.
Oh, where's the sheriff?
- It's Sunday.
He's at the church.
It's a mystery, he's not very religious.
Listen, listen, uh...what time did you say the country coroner was coming to take the stake out?
I didn't say nothing about nothing.
Um, uh, somebody said it was this week...somebody said.
- But it wasn't me.
Can I, can I come in?
Okay but look you can't touch anything.
It's all evidence.
Don't touch anything, you got it?
It's my responsibility, and I don't want that guy yelling at me, I'm sick of it.
Hello.
- Yeah, can I talk to the sheriff?
Just a minute.
Bobby.
Telephone.
Yeah.
- Hey Sheriff, I got that writer fella from out of town here at the office.
He doesn't know it's Sunday?
Let me talk to him.
Hey Bobby, it's Hall Baltimore.
Yeah I couldn't get your story and the image of that poor dead girl out of my mind.
Really?
- Yes, I dreamt about it all night.
I'd like to write that book with you.
So, you're the sheriff and you make bat houses?
Yes, and that's a bird house.
Totally different.
The bats and the birds know which is which.
Well normally I write about witchcraft but... what are vampires but witches that suck blood?
Entirely different.
We haven't really had one here.
There are no witches here, since as long as I can remember.
I could ask my sister.
She's older than Hades.
Welcome to my office.
Come on have a seat.
Imagine this.
Written by...
Hall Baltimore and Bobby LaGrange.
Sweet.
Or, Hall Baltimore with an idea by Bobby LaGrange.
What do you mean an idea by?
I got a hell of a lot more than an idea by.
I got a great character.
- Yeah, who?
Bobby LaGrange.
- Calm` down.
Tell me what you got.
Shoot.
I call it, The Vampire Executions... and that will sell.
Not bad.
Go on.
The girl, who is she?
Is she just a runaway?
Or just some 12 or 13 year old girl ... that looks much older than she really is.
A Vagrant?
Homeless?
Why the wooden stake?
- Yeah, why?
What, did that kill her?
Or was it something that was added later?
As a calling card for the real killer?
You see, one end of it was worn smooth.
No fingerprints.
And then it was pressed into her...slowly.
Not jab, not stab.
Almost as if it was done by some kind of a machine.
A machine?
- Yeah.
That's why I call it The Vampire Executions.
I think she was killed by ...an electric chair ... for vampires.
An execution device, designed especially by and for vampires.
That's different...
I wonder what that would look like.
Well I thought of that.
I made a model.
Ready?
- Ready
How about that?
Watch this.
You love it?
How can I help you, Hall.
- Hey Sam ...
Remember you said if I come with a bulletproof idea, you'd give me an advance?
Another advance.
- Yeah, another, more.
A bulletproof idea comes with meat on the bone.
Not a lot of fog on the lake kind of crap, you know.
Yeah, well no one can mix metaphors quite like you Sam.
Here's the title, right...just listen, The Vampire Executions.
vampires huh?
And the main character get this...
she's a little girl, a murdered girl.
Beautiful.
- Beautiful, yeah, but she's just a kid.
No, no, no, I meant it's beautiful that she gets murdered.
But it's gotta have a lot of story.
Not a lot of style bullshit.
So tell me, how does this execution bit play out?
I, I will find out.
I, I mean there's a great...great twist ending.
With heart.
With tons of heart, and I'll get you a complete outline in the morning.
But you gotta get me a check to Denise right away.
I'm not kidding around, in fact, in fact the bank wire transfer would be better.
It's an emergency
You know, you know, I'm thinking, it's not bulletproof.
But Hall Baltimore, master OF witchcraft doing a vampire story...
It's not bad.
- Not bad at all.
If it's got an ending.
- It's got an ending.
A bulletproof ending.
- Bulletproof
But Sam, you gotta tide my wife over okay?
This is why I'm doing it alright?
25 grand.
Okay, you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna wire Denise 10,000 dollars.
25.
That, that's great.
I really appreciate it.
As I said, I'm gonna wire Denise 10,000 dollars... but I need the outline in the morning or I'm gonna stop payment.
Sam?
- And no fog on the lake.
The night was ... humid.
The night was ... cloudy.
Fog.
A Mist ...a mist descends ... on the, on the lake Mini, Mini, Mini ...
Unwanipanuki.
The fog ... floated out like
Virginia's silent ... dream.
No, that sucks.
The fog on the lake, the fog on the ...
The fog on the lake ... just to torture Sam.
The scent floats out like ... tears.
On a whale's ass?
No.
The fog on the lake...the flake.
The straight edge razor.
The fog on the lake reminds me of my first wife.
It dissipated with time.
I'd lost my mind.
And now I have a lisp.
And now I'm suddenly turning into a black basketball player.
she ... was ...
I'm typing as a gay basketball player from the sixties.
I like short shorts.
They are revealing, but it's confortable.
It helps me jump.
There was no fog on the lake.
Swann Valley, sheriff's department.
Deputy Arbus speaking.
Arbus, the writer fella told me to go do a bunch of errands for him.
Well, he's not back here at his motel.
If you see him, tell him I'll wait another thirty minutes... and that's it...
I got to go.
- Alright, sheriff.
Why isn't the door locked, Arbus?
RESYNCED BY BSpidey87
Yeah, I left it open for you, PJ.
What happened to your diet?
- I was wondering when you were gonna get here with my hamburgers.
Feel like to playing some cards?
sure, but when are you gonna pay up?
Hey PJ, get the chord there woould you.
- Okay. .
Don't ever walk into a morgue like that unannounced.
My heart can't handle it.
- Sorry, I knocked.
Yeah, well, sheriff's over at your motel.
And he said I'll only be here another thirty minutes.
Okay, thanks.
You owe me eighteen bucks, Arbus.
Snooze, Ropopose, Sleep all ...
Night all ... and you didn't put this on your list.
But I liked it.
I thought it was good.
Sleeping All.
- Just what I needed.
Are we gonna work on this together?
That is, what you said.
These are just goanna put you to sleep.
A chance to dream.
But you didn't read the labels.
- Yes I did.
This is how you write?
I thought that all city writers... just got saused and then wrote in some kind of trance.
- We do...we do but...
There is a bulletproof ending out there and I know just the guy to get me there.
Hey do you know a doctor in town that can give me prescription for a real..real one?
I can't do that.
I'm a public official.
Twilight Lights.
By Bobby LaGrange.
Her skin was as fresh as cream, floating up from butter ... under the lace negligee she liked to teasee me with.
What keeps bringing you back here?
I'm trying to solve a mystery.
I'm waiting for you, my friend.
Here, by her tomb.
After you.
- Thank you.
And you are...
Edgar Allan Poe, so..if you...
How can I help?
Well...
I don't have an ending.
Did you know the deacons once corresponded with me ... concerning the technique ...
of writing the ending first.
And working backwards.
What did you need?
Length?
40 to 50 lines, um...per page.
Um...200 page minimum.
Providence?
- Beauty.
The tone?
- They'll tell you.
These points being settled... shall we consider a reframe?
- I like it.
The bell tower is becoming to me.
A reframe must be brief.
In my own work, my most famous... it's lead me at once to a single word is the best...
I'm afraid.
Never more.
The difficulty arose from the presumption that the word ... must be monopolously be spoken by a human being.
then immediately arose the idea of a, a non reasoning creature capable of speech ... and, then very naturally a parrot suggested itself.
But it was superceded forthwith immediately by a raven as equally ... capable of speech, but as a bird of ill omen ... infinitely more in keeping within intent to turn.
Is all this worth the price of that very good bottle of Irish whisky?
Yes, of course, please continue..
So, I asked myself ... of all the melancholy topics ... what according to the universal understanding of mankind is the most tragic?
Death.
And when is this most tragic of melancholy topics... most poetical?
When it most loosely alludes itself...to beauty.
The death therefore, of a beautiful girl ..
is unquestionly the most poetical topic in the world.
Equally it is beyond there that the lips best suited for the topic, are those of the man...
who loved her.
So...
I had to combine these two ideas... of the lover lamented his deceased mistress ... and the raven' continuously using the word "Nevermore"
in a poem of about 100 lines.
And "nevermore" of conclusion of each dancer... in a poem of melancholy tone.
How do you uh, find the ending?
Your story is a tragedy.
It happened here at the old Chikering Hotel where I once slept.
There were many children in the town.
Orphans some wares, the lost children.
And before long they were taken in to protection of pastor Alan Floyd.
He was a kindly man, loved his kids.
And everyone agreed that he took very good care of them.
He taught them cataclysm, and love of God and goodness.
And one night it happened.
One of his children was missing.
And that's when it came out.
Who isn't here?
Peter?
Where did... he didn't go across the lake?
Never ever go with the people across of the lake.
This is very important.
They are like, like, like...vermin.
Unclean, those, those fiends across the lake.
They are...the undead..
They are vampires.
He took care of them and fed them.
Anointed them with the juices of spoilage, and sinkfoil and wolfsbane.
Anointed them against evil.
Turn your head.
- Thank you..
That's right.
There we go.
Make sure that you be nice and safe.
Someday you will wearing ... nylon stockings.
Where the hell is he?
- What are you doing with my mom's Ouija board?
Have you ever seen one of these?
- What would you do with that?
Innovation is what made the detective story and Charlie Chan entertaining.
Bobby LaGrange ...
is an innovative detective.
After you, sir.
That, ouija board.
We are in close proximity... to the deceased.
And the killer is probably still in the area.
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this in a morgue.
Dim the old lights..
Hello.
Do we know you?
- Yes, it is.
You're doing that, I can feel you.
No I'm not
- Shut up!
H..
I..
M.
Him.
It wants you
Okay, do we know you?
I... am ...her.
I am.
Arbus, what was that?
Ask her, let go watch.
Who killed you?
B...
Sheriff, you're doing that.
I can feel it.
- Am not.
Who killed you?
B...
The evil kids at the lake.
They are evil.
And that Flamingo kid, he's the one that infects them.
He's a vampire.
Is he?
'Yes'.
Come on, Arbus.
Keep your gun hidden.
You must be thirsty?
- Exactly
I'm looking for Flamingo.
- He is right back here.
When the sky is low and heavy, weighing as a lid ... on the groaning spirit, falling prey to long boredom...
Educated.. you know BAUDELAIRE.
I know life man.
And I know the dreams of BAUDELAIRE.
And he from the horizon, the entire circle embracing... a dark day for our poor, even sadder than the nights.
I was hoping you could help me find this missing girl.
She is 12 or 13.
There are a lot of girls here.
You know, people are saying what's going on up here is...evil.
Are you worried about that?
Look around you.
Does this look evil to you?
Look at that moon.
It is beautiful.
I have been worried ... it has been 3 days since we've seen her..
She's just a little kid that I take care of, but I'm worried that something has happened to her.
Arbus.
Damn it.
You?
You're out of uniform?
And you're here on unofficial business.
What the hell are you doing here?
he said you were okay with it.
He gave me 20 bucks.
Mr. Collaborator.
I thought we were a team, all the way through this investigation.
Bobby LaGrange does not like to be tricked.
Nor does he like being made a fool out of.
The famous Flamingo ..my..my..my.
The lady killer.
Arbus, arrest this murderer.
He's like that...either coming or going.
Or he's already gone.
Those are the real keys for the...
- These are them.
These are the official keys.
- Wow, that's amazing.
This is to the clock tower?
- Yes, really?
Hey give me, give me that.
Where are you going with that?
Come on, just to see.
- What?
You don't want to go up there.
That's odd, I was up here yesterday ... and I didn't have a hard time with this lock at all.
- Yesterday?
Uh, maybe it was last week.
It worked?
- Maybe it was the week before last.
Let me try.
Here.
- Thanks.
What the hell was that?
You tell me you ever notice anything like that when you were up here?
You're not going up there.
This place is haunted.
Didn't you know that?
What's that smell?
- The devil.
The devil lives up there.
You're gonna get it all over yourself.
I'm going out.
Goodbye.
Come with us daddy.
Come with us daddy.
Help me, daddy.
Come with us daddy.
Help me.
Help me...daddy
Listen,
- What is that?
Are they evil?
No.
No.
Tell me who killed her?
...Tell me.
You say you want to know...
but do you?
I want to know the truth.
- There are consequences.
What choice do I have?
Tell me all of the story.
- As you wish, my friend.
There happened events just make you ashamed to remember.
Please.
- Thank you, it's a sharp knife.
I wanna know what the secret ingredient is.
We're going to have special lemonade for everybody.
That's right...good job.
This stuff stinks.
- Careful.
You cut your finger.
Here you go, Alice.
-Thank you.
You're welcome.
There you go.
- Don't drink the lemonade, he put something in it.
No, stop.
- No I want lemonade.
Virginia!
Virginia, fine.
Enough, ..stand still.
Virginia, is being very...
very sick.
And we're all going to have some lemonade, it's delicious and sweet...taste it.
Stay...stay...stay here.
- What are you doing?
Then he made a fateful decision.
Rather than have his children's souls be damned as vampires, he drugged their lemonade, and slit their throats.
Can you make him stop?
Do something.
Death of beauty.
One child tried to save herself.
Virginia?
You're playing our favorite game, huh?
I'll find you.
Got you.
Virginia.
Virginia.
One way to God.
One, one, one way to God.
I got you.
But the monster caught her, and put her in chains in the vault.
No.
You must stop screaming.
I told you...
God wants you to meet mom.
That's right, scream all what you want,
Even God can't hear you now.
One road, one way to God..
All in Jesus name.
During the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty...
I loved her.
Not as the living and breathing Virginia.
But as the Virginia of the dream.
You see... dear friend... she was my young cousin... my beloved wife.
Her name was Virginia.
But I gave her many names.
Lenor.
Bernice.
The lady Gaia.
Madenasha.
Annabelle Lee.
Alianora.
I assume that I am your partner?
...
Open the door, wake up.
Wake up.
Open the door, Hall.
- Alright, alright..hang on.
Wait 'til you see this.
- What?
I subscribed to "Writers Weekly."
And this just in.
Says that you took a 10,000 dollar advance on a project called "The Vampire Executions."
No, no...that was money for some old writes.
And that money already went to my wife.
That's a mistake.
But I was thinking, I do like "The Vampire Executions"... by Hall Baltimore and Bobby LaGrange.
Give me my $5,000 dollars now.
There's not gonna be any money exchanged until we get to the story right?
We gotta get to the end.
- The end?
The end?
It's a who done it.
Like every other murder mystery.
Just let me wake up.
- It comes to who did it.
Okay.
- What's the matter with you?
You're foregoing your greatest asset.
- Yeah..what's that?
Bobby LaGrange, the detective..
You gotta take Bobby LaGrange and use him much more throughout the entire story, because he could solve the crime himself.
Clearly it's the work of a serial killer.
Someone wants to silence the girls, on the other side of the lake.
Because, they fry a sick mind.
And then they sizzle them, because of some psyco hocus pocus condition.
That condemns them to being the evil sluts that they are.
And that is what's in a sick mind.
You think so, Bobby?
You think they're uh, they're evil sluts?
who?
- The young girls.
Shit yes, they're all into dark things.
Every one of them they worship death...
and sex.
What do you think?
Oh no you don't.
No, not Bobby LaGrange...
them.
Those devil worshiping whores on the other side of the loch.
Shit Yes, they are all into dark things, every one of them.
They worship death and sex.
They were just too saucy for their own good.
You know, they have that white flash with the devil inside them.
That little spice you can't stop, thinking about.
It's not me.
- It's not me.
It's them.
- It's the... flash of the devil.
I saved their souls.
You.
You don't touch me.
Do not touch me. tearing it out.
Old, old bastard.
- Forgive me... forgive me for seeking pleasure outside of the company... cast me another way for my spirit.
Perhaps, it takes the dirt to be boiled, only here alone?
With all of these things together, thrown.
Will burn it.
- Flameproof, bulletproof.
I can't even look at the cliff, without trembling.
This little cliff?
Wait, wait.
Do you dare to go further?
- What are you talking about, tell me the ending.
If you don't stop now, every word... that flows from your pen will be your your own tale.
You.
You are the ending you seek.
How can I stop now when it's so close to the end?
Then it's time to face the truth.
To end this story, there is no other way.
I am so ashamed, I should cry That's my little girl.
That's my daughter.
She wanted me to go with her friends.
I thought they were little boats.
I thought they were childrens boats.
I didn't know they were speedboats.
I couldn't guide them.
I was too drunk to wake up that morning.
I was with a woman.
I am so ashamed.
I could have gone, I set the clock, but it was the wrong time So the alarm didn't go off.
I could have been there ...but been there, maybe still.
I'm so ashamed... so ashamed.
Than maybe if I would have been there she would...
I could have been there, I should have been there.
This little girl.
We share this little ghost, my friend.
Our work must be the grave that we prepare for it's lovely tenant.
Oh God ...
Help me...help me, daddy..
Bulletproof.
You delivered the goods here.
I'm telling you, meat on the bone.
You think so, Sam?
- I do.
Hall Baltimore, master of witchcraft, no more.
Nevermore.
There was once upon a time a town, not far from a big city.
A road ran through, but there were only a few businesses.
A coffee shop, a hardware store, a sheriff's office.
And all kinds of people..
vagrants, runaway teens... religious fanatics, retired seniors who ... well, it was a town of those who want to be left alone... and so they were.
Sheriff, Bobby LaGrange, had been there for years... also made wood novelties.
But the most astonishing thing about the town was ... an old belfry, that had a clock tower with seven faces.
You could see the time from anywhere in the town of Swann Valley.
the faces persistently told different times.
No question, something evil was abiding there.
Perhaps it was because of the terrible murder that happened years before.
Too terrible to talk about.
But which haunted the town.
Or perhaps it was those teenagers who gathered across the lake.
Some people thought they did bad things.
Worshiped Satan.
The way they dressed, the music they played... and their mysterious leader known only as Flamingo.
A seducer of innocent youth... and some said...far worse.
It was at this certain time...
that a third string writer... of popular fiction, Hall Baltimore ... drove into Swann Valley.
On his book signing tour... of another of his series of novels ... about witchcraft.
Excuse me, do you know where the bookstore is?
There's no bookstore around here.
- Great.
Have you ever read a Hall Baltimore thriller?
No, thanks.
Have you ever read Hall Baltimore thriller?
No...
Who is Hall Baltimore?
I am he.
- Oh.
Nice to meet you.
and you are ...
- Stacey.
Oh excuse me, sorry.
- Hi Stacey. bye Stacey.
Hey.
- Hey.
You sell weapons?
Uh, no weapons, just ammunition.
- Pistols?
Ammunition?
- Yes.
Knives?

I'll take one.
Could you uh...autograph it?
- sure.
To Bobby LaGrange.
To Bobby LaGrange.
Best witches.
Hall Baltimore.
How does it feel to be the bargain basement Stephen King?
Not too wonderful.
Well, you know, I uh, I write horror stories myself.
You don't say?
And you're the sheriff here in the town?
40 years.
You wouldn't uh, or Would you, mind reading some of my stuff?
I'd be much obliged.
You know We had a mass murder.
A while back.
A lot of folks think the town's haunted
Well, I'm, I'm uh, just wrapping it up here in the town... and then I'm gonna be on my way.
You a mystery writer and you're not interested in mass murder?
.
No.
you come with me right now... and take a look at the doozie I got in the morgue
You got a doozie in the morgue?
- Yes sir.
now?
- Yes, sir.
There's a story in it.
I know what this must look like ...
- It is like a wood...
Ow!
Jesus!
.
Let me ask you a question.
How long have you worked here?
- Well
You don't run a gurney with a dead person on over my foot!
Sorry, sheriff.
Is this a common occurrence in Swann Valley?
- Tt's happened before.
serial killing it appears to be leaves a calling card as a wooden stake.
I don't want to see her face.
- I don't blame you.
I mean, it's really a tragedy.
She's just a poor girl.
Arbus?
- Yeah?
Arbus!
Alright, alright.
- You're on the clock.
Do you know who she is?
- This girl?
We get all kind here vagrants, runaways..
worse, those kids out at the lake.
All kinds.
How'd you like to calobrate on a book about this?
You and me?
Are you gonna...
leave that stake in her like that?
Howdy.
I'd Like to fill my thermos full of coffee, please.
- Okay
Edgar Allan Poe slept in this town?
Sure did.
- At the old Chickering Hotel way back when.
Chickering Hotel...
Thanks.
- Have a good day.
With my respect sir.
I want to write something I do.
I want to write something for me.
something personal.
Does that make any sense?
I have to break the spell of this downward spiral.
There's only one way to do it and I'm trying to do it.
I'm not gonna write another witch book.
I told them that...and, and, and that's it, I'm gonna do something for me.
You've done it before
When you weren't drinking.
Before Vicky's accident.
I can't rush these things.
You can do this.
I...
I know what...
I know what you mean about you just have to do it one more time.
Just...
write the damn thing, then you can, then you can take the time and write what you really want to write.
I understand, I get it. you know I do.
Did you call Sam?
Did you tell him we need an advance?
Well I did and it was extremely humiliating.
And I'm not gonna write another witch story.
You're having a holiday?
- No Im...
and I'm stuck here
- Listen to me trying to put people off ... come up wiith magic numbers...
to make it all work out.
Pretend there's nothing wrong and put food on the table.
- Denise will you listen to me?
You can't, you can't speak to me like this... just grow up ...grow up!
People always ask me, "How do you know so much about witches?"... and I tell them, "'Cuz I married one."
Hey.
- Hello.
Where do you come from?
Just down the road.
You past me.
You looking at my teeth?
No I'm not, I just didn't know where you came from.
I am very self conscious about my buck teeth.
Show me.
Your teeth are fine.
It's those braces.
Anyway I hate them.
- No, they're fine.
You'll grow into them.
They call me Vampira, because of these teeth.
but you can call me V..
- V. that's nice.
What's your real name?
- Virginia.
Virginia.
You're about 13?
Yeah, I'm 12.
But I look older because I'm tall.
I know who you are.
You wrote those witch stories.
And you're here to sign books over at the hardware store.
I love your books.
Especially the part where Elizabeth says,
"Forsake me never, for I will entice you from my grave."
That's my favorite part.
Thanks, I like your look.
Oh ...yeah.
It's just the way I dress.
You scared of me yet?
- What?
Yes.
A little.
That clock it chimed midnight three times already.
Keeping track of time around here is pointless.
That's why I missed your book signing.
Well that old hotel is open.
Come on I'll buy you a soda...sweetie
I have a girl your age.
No, I don't think that a particularly good idea.
- Why not?
That's what I had to go to the hardware store and talk about.
My story.
Well tell it to me now.
- No, I can't.
Come on.
We're open.
Come in.
I...went for walk, I guess I got lost.
Hey what happened to that little girl?
- What little girl?
Is the restaurant open?
- Restaurant's always open.
What with that old clock tower and all those faces, you can get breakfast anytime.
Yes.
Well, Mr...
- Baltimore.
Damned clock.
That clock has never told the correct time.
Just you wait.
You're gonna be very surprised.
Bell's the important thing, and it's working beautifully.
Better than before.
- I'll just uh, have a beer.
Melvin is the belfry custodian, assigned to the big clock at church.
It's a hopeless job.
And a real burden.
That old mechanism's on it's last legs .
I go up there about every day, or most.
Those seven faces they look at me like I was the one who invented daylight savings time.
You know who came up with daylight savings time, don't you?
Hitler.
And, you know who supports it now?
Doctors.
And you know why?
Golf.
They want more time to golf.
That's what it's all about.
You can't change time.
Time changes you.
Don't you agree?
What's your position on daylight savings time?
I've never really thought about it.
- What have you been thinking about?
That's the grave.
- Grave?
Oh you can walk on it.
Don't worry.
The whole floor is a grave.
It is?
- There are twelve children buried right down there.
13 children murdered in cold blood.
Well, actually he's right.
It is an even dozen, but one got away and she was damned.
When was that?
- Oh, a long Time ago.
The clock is fixed.
The clock is fixed.
Ha, the clock is fixed.
The clock is fixed.
Got you, devil.
She drew blood.
- Suck it out...suck it out, suck it out.
Goddamn her...
- Hey write it down.
What time did she bite you?
4 o'clock.
- It isn't 4 o'clock.
The clock says four o'clock.
- You've got to be kidding me?
She's the devil.
It's the dead little kids.
You?
Why are you here?
what has she told you?
- Nothing.
What should she tell me?
Go away, old man...you know what you did.
Children...hurry.
The moon is going down...
time for nap.
Come on.
Come along now, come on.
my God, I'm lost.
Maybe this is what I need, ...this story.
Where are you going?
Help me.
You?
My god...
Edgar Poe.
show me the way.
Hall, wake up.
Are you, I know you're there.
Are you awake?
- What?
It wasn't me.
It's me.
This is your wife.
Hello?
Hall, wake up.
Are you, I know you're there.
What's the matter?
- Are you awake?
It's me.
What's the matter?
Everything okay?
This is your wife.
Yeah, I know who you are.
I didn't, well...
I need a second.
What's, oh my god.
What have you done?
Yeah?
That?
do you know how much it's worth?
- Yeah, I do.
160,000 dollars.
No, it's worth a lot more than that.
It's priceless.
you shouldn't even be touching it.
How did you get into my safe?
Just calm down.
please stop, just, just, whatever you're doing, just stop and put it down.
That's really not a joke..
you think it's.
I don't think it's funny.
It's a nice book though eh?
Yes, Whitman only had... there's only four of those in private hands okay.
Do you understand what that means?
Do you..
He set the type himself.
- Do you think I'm joking?
please.
- you know what...
I think you care more this old book than you do your own family.
You need the gloves for that.
- You Know what?
Get the advance or you can kiss it good bye.
Please.
- Don't make me have to do this.
I don't want to...
I have to.
Hello.
I'm looking for ...
- Mrs. LaGrange is sleeping.
Quiet.
Oh, sorry.
I'd like to know if you have any information on the old Chickering Hotel?
I'll check the files.
Thank you
Swann Valley, sheriff's office please.
one moment.
Your number is 393 229 39 23 .
do you wish to be connected?
Yes.
Sheriff's office, we're closed.
Yes, hi, it's me, You remember me, the writer.
I'm here at the window.
I'm gonna go to the front door.
Alright.
We're closed.
- Can I talk to you?
Look sheriff says nothing happens as long as that thing is in here.
Oh, where's the sheriff?
- It's Sunday.
He's at the church.
It's a mystery, he's not very religious
Listen, listen, uh...what time did you say the country coroner was coming to take the stake out?
I didn't say nothing about nothing
Um, uh, somebody said it was this week...somebody said.
- But it wasn't me.
Can I, can I come in?
Okay but look you can't touch anything.
It's all evidence.
Don't touch anything, you got it?
It's my responsibility, and I don't want that guy yelling at me, I'm sick of it.
Hello.
- Yeah, can I talk to the sheriff?
Just a minute.
Bobby.
Telephone.
Yeah.
- Hey Sheriff, I got that writer fella from out of town here at the office.
He doesn't know it's Sunday?
Let me talk to him.
Hey Bobby, it's Hall Baltimore.
Yeah I couldn't get your story and the image of that poor dead girl out of my mind.
Really?
- Yes, I dreamt about it all night.
I'd like to write that book with you.
So, you're the sheriff and you make bat houses?
Yes, and that's a bird house.
Totally different. .
The bats and the birds know which is which.
Weell normally I write about witchcraft but ... what are vampires but witches that suck blood.
Entirely different.
We haven't really had one here.
There are no witches here, since as long as I can remember.
I could ask my sister.
She's older than Hades.
Welcome to my office.
Come on have a seat.
Imagine this.
Written by...
Hall Baltimore and Bobby LaGrange.
Sweet.
Or, Hall Baltimore with an idea by Bobby LaGrange.
What do you mean an idea by?
I got a hell of a lot more than an idea by.
I got a great character.
- Yeah, who?
Bobby LaGrange.
- Calm` down.
Tell me what you got.
Shoot.
I call it, The Vampire Executions... and that will sell.
Not bad.
Go on.
The girl, who is she?
is she just a runaway?
Or just some 12 or 13 year old girl ... that looks much older than she really is.
A Vagrant?
Homeless?
Why the wooden stake?
- Yeah, why?
What, did that kill her?
Or was it something that was added later?
As a calling card for the real killer?
You see, one end of it was worn smooth.
No fingerprints.
And then it was pressed into her...slowly.
Not jab, not stab.
Almost as if it was done by some kind of a machine.
A machine?
- Yeah.
That's why I call it The Vampire Executions.
I think she was killed by ...an electric chair ... for vampires.
An execution device, designed especially by and for vampires.
That's different...
I wonder what that would look like.
Well I thought of that.
I made a model.
Ready?
- Ready
How about that?
Watch this.
You love it?
How can I help you, Hall.
- Hey Sam ... remember you said if I come with a bulletproof idea, you'd give me an advance?
Another advance.
- Yeah, another, more.
A bulletproof idea comes with meat on the bone.
Not a lot of fog on the lake kind of crap, you know.
Yeah, well no one can mix metaphors quite like you Sam.
Here's the title, right...just listen The Vampire Executions.
vampires huh?
And the main character get this...
she's a little girl, a murdered girl.
Beautiful.
- Beautiful, yeah, but she's just a kid.
No, no, no, I meant it's beautiful that she gets murdered.
But it's gotta have a lot of story.
Not a lot of style bullshit.
So tell me, how does this execution bit play out?
I, I will find out.
I, I mean there's a great...great twist ending.
With heart.
With tons of heart, and I'll get you a complete outline in the morning.
But you gotta get me a check to Denise right away.
I'm not kidding around, in fact, in fact the bank wire transfer would be better.
It's an emergency
You know, you know, I'm thinking, it's not bulletproof.
But Hall Baltimore, master OF witchcraft doing a vampire story...
It's not bad.
- Not bad at all.
If it's got an ending.
- It's got an ending.
A bulletproof ending.
- Bulletproof
But Sam, you gotta tide my wife over okay?
This is why I'm doing it alright?
25 grand.
Okay, you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna wire Denise 10,000 dollars.
25.
That, that's great.
I really appreciate it.
As I said, I'm gonna wire Denise 10,000 dollars... but I need the outline in the morning or I'm gonna stop payment.
Sam?
- And no fog on the lake.
The night was ... humid.
The night was ... cloudy.
Fog.
A Mist ...a mist descends ... on the, on the lake Mini, Mini, Mini ...
Unwanipanuki.
The fog ... floated out like
Virginia's silent ... dream.
No, that sucks.
The fog on the lake, the fog on the ...
The fog on the lake ... just to torture Sam.
The scent floats out like ... tears.
On a whale's ass?
No.
The fog on the lake...the flake.
The straight edge razor.
The fog on the lake reminds me of my first wife.
It dissipated with time.
I'd lost my mind.
And now I have a lisp.
And now I'm suddenly turning into a black basketball player.
she ... was ...
I/m typing as a gay basketball player from the sixties.
I like short shorts.
They are revealing, but it's confortable.
It helps me jump.
There was no fog on the lake.
Swann Valley, sheriff's department.
Deputy Arbus speaking.
Arbus, the writer fella told me to go do a bunch of errands for him... well, he's not back here at his motel.
If you see him, tell him I'll wait another thirty minutes... and that's it...
I got to go.
- Alright, sheriff.
Why isn't the door locked, Arbus?
Yeah, I left it open for you, PJ.
what happened to your diet?
- I was wondering when you were gonna get here with my hamburgers.
Feel like to playing some cards?
sure, but when are you gonna pay up?
Hey PJ, get the chord there woould you.
- Okay. .
Don't ever walk into a morgue like that unannounced.
My heart can't handle it.
- Sorry, I knocked.
Yeah, well, sheriff's over at your motel ... and he said I'll only be here another thirty minutes.
Okay, thanks.
You owe me eighteen bucks, Arbus.
Snooze, Ropopose, Sleep all ...
Night all ... and you didn't put this on your list.
But I liked it.
I thought it was good.
Sleeping All.
- Just what I needed.
Are we gonna work on this together?
That is, what you said.
These are just goanna put you to sleep.
A chance to dream.
But you didn't read the label's.
- Yes I did.
This is how you write?
I thought that all city writers... just got sauced and then wrote in some kind of trance
- We do...we do but...
There is a bulletproof ending out there and I know just the guy to get me there ...
Hey do you know a doctor in town that can give me prescription for a real..real one?
I can't do that.
I'm a public official.
Twilight Lights.
By Bobby LaGrange.
Her skin was as fresh as cream, floating up from butter ... under the lace negligee she liked to teasee me with.
What keeps bringing you back here?
I'm trying to solve a mystery.
I'm waiting for you, my friend.
Here, by her tomb.
After you.
- Thank you.
And you are...
Edgar Allan Poe, so..if you...
How can I help?
well...
I don't have no ending.
Did you know the deacons once corresponded with me ... concerning the technique ...
of writing the ending first.
And working backwards.
What did you need?
Length?
40 to 50 lines ... per page.
200 page minimum.
Providence?
- Beauty.
The tone?
- They'll tell you.
These points being settled... shall we consider the reframe?
- I like it.
The bell tower is becoming to me.
A reframe must be brief.
In my own work, my most famous... it's lead me at once to a single word is the best...
I'm afraid.
Never more.
The difficulty arose from the presumption that the word ... must be monopolously be spoken by a human being.
then immediately arose the idea of a, a non reasoning creature capable of speech ... and, then very naturally a parrot suggested itself.
But it was superceded forthwith immediately by a raven as equally ... capable of speech, but as a bird of ill omen ... infinitely more in keeping within intent to turn.
Is all this worth the price of that very good bottle of Irish whisky?
Yes, of course, please continue..
So, I asked myself ... of all the melancholy topics ... what according to the universal understanding of mankind is the most tragic?
Death.
And when is this most tragic of melancholy topics... most poetical?
When it most loosely alludes itself ... to beauty.
The death therefore, of a beautiful girl ..
is unquestionly the most poetical topic in the world.
Equally it is beyond there that the lips best suited for the topic are those of the man ...
who loved her.
So ...
I had to combine these two ideas ... of the lover lamented his deceased mistress ... and the raven' continuously using the word "Nevermore"
in a poem of about 100 lines.
And "nevermore" of conclusion of each dancer... in a poem of melancholy tone.
How do you uh, find the ending?
Your story is a tragedy.
It happened here at the old Chikering hotel where I once slept.
There were many children in the town.
Orphans some wares, the lost children.
And before long they were taking in to protection of pastor Alan Floyd.
He was a kindly man, loved his kids.
And everyone agreed that he took very good care of them.
He taught them cataclysm, and love of god and goodness.
And one night it happened.
One of his children was missing.
And that's when it came out.
Who isn't here?
Peter?
Where did... he didn't go across the lake.
Never ever go with the people across of the lake.
This is very important.
They are like, like, like...vermin.
Unclean, those, those fiends across the lake.
They are ... the undead..
They are vampires.
He took care of them and fed them.
Anointed them with the juices of spoilage, and sinkfoil and wolfsbane.
Anointed them against evil.
Turn your head.
- Thank you..
That's right.
There we go.
Make sure that you be nice and safe.
Someday you will wearing ... nylon stockings.
Where the hell is he?
- What are you doing with my mom's Ouija board?
Have you ever seen one of these?
- What would you do with that?
Innovation is what made the detective story and Charlie Chan entertaining.
Bobby LaGrange ...
is an innovative detective.
After you, sir.
That, ouija board.
We are in close proximity... to the deceased.
And the killer is probably still in the area.
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this in a morgue.
Dim the old lights..
Hello.
Do we know you?
- Yes, it is.
You're doing that, I can feel you.
No I'm not
- Shut up!
H..
I..
M.
Him.
It wants you
Okay, do we know you?
I... am ... her.
I am.
Arbus, what was that?
Ask her, let go watch.
Who killed you?
B...
Sheriff, you're doing that.
I can feel it.
- Am not.
Who killed you?
B...
The evil kids at the lake.
They are evil.
And that Flamingo kid, he's the one that infects them.
He's a vampire.
Is he?
'Yes'.
Come on, Arbus.
Keep your gun hidden.
You must be thirsty?
- Exactly
I'm looking for Flamingo.
- He is right back here.
When the sky is low and heavy, weighing as a lid ... on the groaning spirit, falling prey to long boredom...
Educated.. you know BAUDELAIRE.
I know life man.
And I know the dreams of BAUDELAIRE.
and he from the horizon, the entire circle embracing... a dark day for our poor, even sadder than the nights.
I was hoping you could help me find this missing girl.
She is 12 or 13.
There are a lot of girls here.
You know, people are saying what's going on up here is...evil.
Are you worried about that?
Look around you.
Does this look evil to you?
Look at that moon.
It is beautiful.
I have been worried ... it has been 3 days since we've seen her..
She's just a little kid that I take care of, but I'm worried that something has happened to her.
Arbus.
Damn it.
You?
You're out off uniform?
And you're here on unofficial business.
What the hell are you doing here?
he said you were okay with it.
He gave me 20 bucks.
Mr. Collaborator.
I thought we were a team, all the way through this investigation.
Bobby LaGrange does not like to be tricked.
Nor does he like being made a fool out of.
The famous Flamingo ..my..my..my the lady killer.
Arbus, arrest this murderer.
He's like that...either coming or going.
Or he's already gone.
Those are the real keys for the...
- These are them .... these are the official keys.
- Wow, that's amazing.
This is to the clock tower?
- Yes, really?
Hey give me, give me that.
Where are you going with that?
Come on, just to see.
- What?
You don't want to go up there.
That's odd, I was up here yesterday ... and I didn't have a hard time with this lock at all.
- Yesterday?
Uh, maybe it was last week.
It worked?
- Maybe it was the week before last.
Let me try.
Here.
- Thanks.
What the hell was that?
You tell me you ever notice anything like that when you were up here?
You're not going up there.
This place is haunted.
Didn't you know that?
What's that smell?
- The devil.
The devil lives up there.
You're gonna get it all over yourself.
I'm going out.
Goodbye.
come with us daddy...
come with us daddy
Help me, daddy...
Come with us daddy.
Help me...
Help me...daddy
listen,
- What is that?
Are they evil?
No.
No.
tell me who killed her?
...tell me.
You say that you want to know..
but do you?
I want to know the truth.
- There are consequences.
What choice do I have?
Tell me all of the story.
- As you wish, my friend.
There happened events just make you ashamed to remember.
Please.
- Thank you, it's a sharp of knife.
I wanna know what the secret ingredient is.
We're going to have special lemonade for everybody.
That's right...good job.
This stuff stinks.
- Careful.
You cut your finger.
Here you go, Alice.
-Thank you.
You're welcome.
There you go.
- Don't drink the lemonade, he put something in it.
No, stop.
- No I would like `lemonade, Virginia
Virginia, fine.
Enough, ..stand still.
Virginia, is being very...
very sick.
And we're all going to have some lemonade, it's delicious and sweet...taste it.
Stay...stay...stay here.
- What are you doing?
Then he made a fateful decision.
Rather than have his children's souls be damned as vampires he drugged their lemonade, and slit their throats.
Can you make him stop?
Do something..
Death of beauty.
One child tried to save herself.
Virginia?
You're playing our favorite game, huh?
I'll find you.
Got you.
Virginia.
Virginia.
One way to God.
One, one, one way to God.
I got you.
Once the monster caught her he put her in chains in the vault.
No.
You must stop screaming.
I told you...
God wants you to meet mom.
That's right. scream all what you want,
Even God can't hear you now.
One road, one way to God..
All in Jesus name.
During the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty...
I loved her..
not as the living and breathing Virginia ... but as the Virginia of the dream.
You see ... dear friend ... she was my young cousin ... my beloved wife.
her name was Virginia.
but I gave her many names.
Lenor
Bernice.
The lady Gaia.
Madenasha.
Annabelle Lee.
Alianora.
I assume that I am your partner?
...
Open the door, wake up.
Wake up.
Open the door, Hall.
- Alright, alright..hang on.
Wait 'til you see this.
- What?
I subscribed to "Writers Weekly."
and this just in... says that you took a 10,000 dollar advance on a project called "The Vampire Executions."
No, no.. that was money for some old writes.
And that money already went to my wife.
that's a mistake.
But I was thinking, I do like "The Vampire Executions"... by Hall Baltimore and Bobby LaGrange.
give me my $5,000 dollar now.
There's not gonna be any money exchanged until we get to the story right?
We gotta get to the end.
- The end?
The end?
It's a who done it.
Like every other murder mystery.
Just let me wake up.
- It comes to who did it.
Okay.
- What's the matter with you?
You're foregoing your greatest asset.
- Yeah..what's that?
Bobby LaGrange, the detective..
You gotta take Bobby LaGrange and use him much more throughout the entire story ... because he could solve the crime himself..
clearly it's the work of a serial killer.
Someone wants to silence the girls, on the other side of the lake.
because, they fried a sick mind.
And then they sizzle them, because of some psyco hocus pocus condition... that condemns them to being the evil sluts that they are.
And that is what's in a sick mind.
You think so, Bobby?
You think they're uh, they're evil sluts?
whom?
- The young girls.
Shit yes, they're all into dark things... every one of them they worship death...
and sex.
What do you think?
Oh no you don't...
No, not Bobby LaGrange...
them.
Those devil worshiping whores on the other side of the loch.
Shit Yes, they are all in dark thing every one of them.
They worship death and sex.
They were just too saucy for their own good.
You know, they have that white flash with the devil inside them.
That little spice you can't stop, thinking about.
It's not me.
- It's not me.
It's them.
- It's the... flash of the devil.
I saved their souls
You... you don't touch me.
Do not touch me. tearing it out.
Old, old bastard.
- Forgive me... forgive me for seeking pleasure outside of the company ... cast me another way for my spirit.
perhaps, it takes the dirt to be boiled, only here alone?
With all of these things together, thrown ... will burn it ...
- Flame-proof, bullet-proof.
I can't even look at the cliff, without trembling.
This little cliff?
Wait, wait.
Do you dare to go further?
- What are you talking about, tell me the ending.
If you don't stop now, every word ..
that flows from your pen will be your your own tale.
You.
You are the ending you seek.
How can I stop now when it's so close to the end?
Then it's time to face the truth.
To end this story, there is no other way.
I am so ashamed, I should cry That's my little girl.
That's my daughter.
She wanted me to go with her friends.
I thought they were little boats....
I thought they were childrens boats.
I didn't know they were speedboats.
I couldn't guide them.
I was too drunk to wake up that morning.
I was with a woman.
I am so ashamed.
I could have gone, I set the clock, but it was the wrong time So the alarm didn't go off.
I could have been there ...but been there, maybe still...
I'm so ashamed... so ashamed.
Than maybe if I would have been there she would...
I could have been there, I should have been there.
This little girl.
We share this little ghost, my friend.
Our work must be the grave that we prepare for it's lovely tenant.
Oh God ...
Help me...help me, Daddy..
'Bullet Proof'.
You delivered the goods here.
I'm telling you, meat on the bone.
You think so, Sam?
- I do.
Hall Baltimore, master of witchcraft, no more.
Never more.
There was once upon a time a town, not far from a big city.
A road ran through, but there were only a few businesses.
A coffee shop, a hardware store, a sheriff's office.
And all kinds of people..
Vagrants, runaway teens...
Religious fanatics, retired seniors who...
Well, it was a town of those who want to be left alone...
And so they were.
Sheriff, Bobby LaGrange, had been there for years...
Also made wood novelties.
But the most astonishing thing about the town was...
An old belfry, that had a clock tower with seven faces.
You could see the time from anywhere in the town of Swann valley.
The faces persistently told different times.
No question, something evil was abiding there.
Perhaps it was because of the terrible murder that happened years before.
Too terrible to talk about.
But which haunted the town.
Or perhaps it was those teenagers who gathered across the lake.
Some people thought they did bad things.
Worshiped Satan.
The way they dressed, the music they played...
And their mysterious leader known only as flamingo.
A seducer of innocent youth...
And some said... far worse.
It was at this certain time...
That a third string writer...
Of popular fiction, hall Baltimore...
Drove into Swann valley.
On his book signing tour...
Of another of his series of novels...
About witchcraft.
Excuse me, do you know where the bookstore is?
- There's no bookstore around here.
- Great.
Have you ever read a hall Baltimore thriller?
No, thanks.
Have you ever read hall Baltimore thriller?
No... who is hall Baltimore?
- I am he.
- Oh.
Nice to meet you.
- And you are...
- Stacey.
- Oh excuse me, sorry.
- Hi Stacey.
Bye Stacey.

- Uh, no weapons, just ammunition.

- Ammunition?
- Yes.
- Knives?
- Isle 2.
The hall Baltimore.
I'll take one.
- Could you uh... autograph it?
- Sure.
To Bobby LaGrange.
To Bobby LaGrange.
Best witches.
Hall Baltimore.
How does it feel to be the bargain basement Stephen king?
Not too wonderful.
Well, you know, I uh, I write horror stories myself.
You don't say?
And you're the sheriff here in the town?
40 years.
You wouldn't uh, or would you, mind reading some of my stuff?
I'd be much obliged.
You know we had a mass murder.
A while back.
A lot of folks think the town's haunted well, I'm, I'm uh, just wrapping it up here in the town...
And then I'm gonna be on my way.
You a mystery writer and you're not interested in mass murder?
No.
You come with me right now...
And take a look at the doozie I got in the morgue.
- You got a doozie in the morgue?
- Yes sir.
- Now?
- Yes, sir.
There's a story in it.
- I know what this must look like...
- It is like a wood...
- Ow!
Jesus!
Let me ask you a question.
How long have you worked here?
- Well you don't run a gurney with a dead person on over my foot!
Sorry, sheriff.
- Is this a common occurrence in Swann valley?
- It's happened before.
Serial killing it appears to be leaves a calling card as a wooden stake.
- I don't want to see her face.
- I don't blame you.
I mean, it's really a tragedy.
She's just a poor girl.
- Arbus?
- Yeah?
- Arbus!
- Alright, alright.
- You're on the clock.
- Do you know who she is?
- This girl?
We get all kind here vagrants, runaways..
Worse, those kids out at the lake.
All kinds.
How'd you like to collaborate on a book about this?
You and me?
Are you gonna...
leave that stake in her like that?
- Howdy.
I'd like to fill my thermos full of coffee, please.
- Okay
Edgar Allan poe slept in this town?
- Sure did.
- At the old chickering hotel way back when.
- Chickering hotel... thanks.
- Have a good day.
With my respect sir.
I want to write something I do.
I want to write something for me.
Something personal.
Does that make any sense?
I have to break the spell of this downward spiral.
There's only one way to do it and I'm trying to do it.
I'm not gonna write another witch book.
I told them that... and, and, and that's it, I'm gonna do something for me.
You've done it before when you weren't drinking.
Before Vicky's accident.
I can't rush these things.
You can do this.
I...
I know what...
I know what you mean about you just have to do it one more time.
Just... write the damn thing, then you can, then you can take the time and write what you really want to write.
I understand, I get it.
You know I do.
Did you call Sam?
Did you tell him we need an advance?
Well I did and it was extremely humiliating.
And I'm not gonna write another witch story.
- You're having a holiday?
- No I'm...
And I'm stuck here.
- Listen to me... can you?
- Trying to put people off...
Come up with magic numbers...
To make it all work out.
Pretend there's nothing wrong and put food on the table.
Denise will you listen to me?
You can't, you can't speak to me like this... just grow up...
Grow up!
People always ask me, "how do you know so much about witches?"
And I tell them, "'cause I married one."
- Hey.
- Hello.
Where do you come from?
Just down the road.
You past me.
You looking at my teeth?
No I'm not, I just didn't know where you came from.
I am very self conscious about my buck teeth.
Show me.
Your teeth are fine.
It's those braces.
- Anyway I hate them.
- No, they're fine.
You'll grow into them.
They call me vampira, because of these teeth.
- But you can call me V.
- V. That's nice.
- What's your real name?
- Virginia.
Virginia.
You're about 13?
Yeah, I'm 12.
But I look older because I'm tall.
I know who you are.
You wrote those witch stories.
And you're here to sign books over at the hardware store.
I love your books.
Especially the part where Elizabeth says,
"forsake me never, for I will entice you from my grave."
That's my favorite part.
Thanks, I like your look.
Oh... yeah.
It's just the way I dress.
- You scared of me yet?
- What?
Yes.
A little.
That clock it chimed midnight three times already.
Keeping track of time around here is pointless.
That's why I missed your book signing.
Well that old hotel is open.
Come on I'll buy you a soda... sweetie
I have a girl your age.
- No, I don't think that a particularly good idea.
- Why not?
That's what I had to go to the hardware store and talk about.
My story.
- Well tell it to me now.
- No, I can't.
Come on.
We're open.
Come in.
I... went for walk, I guess I got lost.
- Hey what happened to that little girl?
- What little girl?
- Is the restaurant open?
- Restaurant's always open.
What with that old clock tower and all those faces, you can get breakfast anytime.
Yes.
- Well, Mr...
- Baltimore.
Damned clock.
That clock has never told the correct time.
Just you wait.
You're gonna be very surprised.
Bell's the important thing, and it's working beautifully.
- Better than before.
- I'll just uh, have a beer.
Melvin is the belfry custodian, assigned to the big clock at church.
It's a hopeless job.
And a real burden.
That old mechanism's on it's last legs.
I go up there about every day, or most.
Those seven faces they look at me like I was the one who invented daylight savings time.
You know who came up with daylight savings time, don't you?
Hitler.
And, you know who supports it now?
Doctors.
And you know why?
Golf.
They want more time to golf.
That's what it's all about.
You can't change time.
Time changes you.
Don't you agree?
What's your position on daylight savings time?
- I've never really thought about it.
- What have you been thinking about?
- That's the grave.
- Grave?
Oh you can walk on it.
Don't worry.
The whole floor is a grave.
- It is?
- There are twelve children buried right down there.
13 children murdered in cold blood.
Well, actually he's right.
It is an even dozen, but one got away and she was damned.
- When was that?
- Oh, a long time ago.
The clock is fixed.
The clock is fixed.
Ha, the clock is fixed.
The clock is fixed.
Got you, devil.
- She drew blood.
- Suck it out... suck it out, suck it out.
- Goddamn her...
- Hey - write it down.
- What time did she bite you?
4 o'clock.
- It isn't 4 o'clock.
- The clock says four o'clock.
- You've got to be kidding me?
She's the devil.
It's the dead little kids.
You?
Why are you here?
- What has she told you?
- Nothing.
What should she tell me?
Go away, old man... you know what you did.
Children... hurry.
The moon is going down...
Time for nap.
Come on.
Come along now, come on.
My God, I'm lost.
Maybe this is what I need, this story.
Where are you going?
Help me.
You?
My God...
Edgar poe.
Show me the way.
Hall, wake up.
- Are you, I know you're there.
Are you awake?
- What?
It wasn't me.
It's me.
This is your wife.
Hello?
Hall, wake up.
Are you, i know you're there.
- What's the matter?
- Are you awake?
It's me.
What's the matter?
Everything okay?
This is your wife.
Yeah, i know who you are.
I didn't, well...
I need a second.
What's, oh my God.
What have you done?
Yeah?
That?
- Do you know how much it's worth?
- Yeah, I do.
160,000 dollars.
No, it's worth a lot more than that.
It's priceless.
You shouldn't even be touching it.
How did you get into my safe?
Just calm down.
Please stop, just, just, whatever you're doing, just stop and put it down.
That's really not a joke..
You think it's.
I don't think it's funny.
It's a nice book though eh?
Yes, Whitman only had...
There's only four of those in private hands okay.
Do you understand what that means?
- Do you...
He set the type himself.
- Do you think I'm joking?
- Please.
- You know what...
I think you care more this old book than you do your own family.
- You need the gloves for that.
- You know what?
Get the advance or you can kiss it good bye.
- Please.
- Don't make me have to do this.
I don't want to...
I have to.
- Hello.
I'm looking for...
- Mrs. LaGrange is sleeping.
Quiet.
Oh, sorry.
I'd like to know if you have any information on the old chickering hotel?
I'll check the files.
Thank you
Swann valley, sheriff's office please.
One moment.
Your number is 393 229 39 23.
Do you wish to be connected?
Yes.
Sheriff's office, we're closed.
Yes, hi, it's me, you remember me, the writer.
I'm here at the window.
I'm gonna go to the front door.
Alright.
- We're closed.
- Can I talk to you?
Look sheriff says nothing happens as long as that thing is in here.
- Oh, where's the sheriff?
- It's Sunday.
He's at the church.
It's a mystery, he's not very religious listen, listen, uh... what time did you say the country coroner was coming to take the stake out?
I didn't say nothing about nothing.
- Um, uh, somebody said it was this week... somebody said.
- But it wasn't me.
Can I, can I come in?
Okay but look you can't touch anything.
It's all evidence.
Don't touch anything, you got it?
It's my responsibility, and I don't want that guy yelling at me, I'm sick of it.
- Hello.
- Yeah, can I talk to the sheriff?
Just a minute.
Bobby.
Telephone.
- Yeah.
- Hey sheriff, I got that writer fella from out of town here at the office.
He doesn't know it's Sunday?
Let me talk to him.
Hey Bobby, it's hall Baltimore.
Yeah I couldn't get your story and the image of that poor dead girl out of my mind.
- Really?
- Yes, I dreamt about it all night.
I'd like to write that book with you.
So, you're the sheriff and you make bat houses?
Yes, and that's a bird house.
Totally different..
The bats and the birds know which is which.
Well normally I write about witchcraft but...
What are vampires but witches that suck blood.
Entirely different.
We haven't really had one here.
There are no witches here, since as long as I can remember.
I could ask my sister.
She's older than Hades.
Welcome to my office.
Come on have a seat.
Imagine this.
Written by...
Hall Baltimore and Bobby LaGrange.
Sweet.
Or, hall Baltimore with an idea by Bobby LaGrange.
What do you mean an idea by?
I got a hell of a lot more than an idea by.
- I got a great character.
- Yeah, who?
- Bobby LaGrange.
- Calm` down.
Tell me what you got.
Shoot.
I call it, the vampire executions...
And that will sell.
Not bad.
Go on.
The girl, who is she?
Is she just a runaway?
Or just some 12 or 13 year old girl...
That looks much older than she really is.
A vagrant?
Homeless?
- Why the wooden stake?
- Yeah, why?
What, did that kill her?
Or was it something that was added later?
As a calling card for the real killer?
You see, one end of it was worn smooth.
No fingerprints.
And then it was pressed into her... slowly.
Not jab, not stab.
Almost as if it was done by some kind of a machine.
- A machine?
- Yeah.
That's why I call it the vampire executions.
I think she was killed by.
..An electric chair...
For vampires.
An execution device, designed especially by and for vampires.
That's different...
I wonder what that would look like.
Well I thought of that.
I made a model.
- Ready?
- Ready how about that?
Watch this.
You love it?
- How can I help you, Hall.
- Hey Sam...
Remember you said if I come with a bulletproof idea, you'd give me an advance?
- Another advance.
- Yeah, another, more.
A bulletproof idea comes with meat on the bone.
Not a lot of fog on the lake kind of crap, you know.
Yeah, well no one can mix metaphors quite like you Sam.
Here's the title, right... just listen the vampire executions.
Vampires huh?
And the main character get this...
She's a little girl, a murdered girl.
- Beautiful.
- Beautiful, yeah, but she's just a kid.
No, no, no, I meant it's beautiful that she gets murdered.
But it's gotta have a lot of story.
Not a lot of style bullshit.
So tell me, how does this execution bit play out?
I, I will find out.
I, I mean there's a great... great twist ending.
With heart.
With tons of heart, and I'll get you a complete outline in the morning.
But you gotta get me a check to Denise right away.
I'm not kidding around, in fact, in fact the bank wire transfer would be better.
It's an emergency you know, you know, I'm thinking, it's not bulletproof.
But hall Baltimore, master of witchcraft doing a vampire story...
- It's not bad.
- Not bad at all.
- If it's got an ending.
- It's got an ending.
- A bulletproof ending.
- Bulletproof but Sam, you gotta tide my wife over okay?
This is why I'm doing it alright?
25 grand.
Okay, you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna wire Denise 10,000 dollars.
25.
That, that's great.
I really appreciate it.
As I said, I'm gonna wire Denise 10,000 dollars...
But I need the outline in the morning or I'm gonna stop payment.
- Sam?
- And no fog on the lake.
The night was... humid.
The night was... cloudy.
Fog.
A mist...
A mist descends...
On the, on the lake mini, mini, mini...
Unwanipanuki Lake.
The fog... floated out like
Virginia's silent...
Dream.
No, that sucks.
The fog on the lake, the fog on the...
The fog on the lake...
Just to torture Sam.
The scent floats out like...
Tears.
On a whale's ass?
No.
The fog on the lake... the flake.
The straight edge razor.
The fog on the lake reminds me of my first wife.
It dissipated with time.
I'd lost my mind.
And now I have a lisp.
And now I'm suddenly turning into a black basketball player.
She... was...
I'm typing as a gay basketball player from the sixties.
I like short shorts.
They are revealing, but it's comfortable.
It helps me jump.
There was no fog on the lake.
Swann valley, sheriff's department.
Deputy arbus speaking.
Arbus, the writer fella told me to go do a bunch of errands for him...
Well, he's not back here at his motel.
If you see him, tell him I'll wait another thirty minutes...
- And that's it...
I got to go.
- Alright, sheriff.
Why isn't the door locked, arbus?
Yeah, I left it open for you, pj.
- What happened to your diet?
- I was wondering when you were gonna get here with my hamburgers.
Feel like to playing some cards?
Sure, but when are you gonna pay up?
- Hey PJ, get the chord there would you.
- Okay...
Don't ever walk into a morgue like that unannounced.
- My heart can't handle it.
- Sorry, I knocked.
Yeah, well, sheriff's over at your motel...
And he said I'll only be here another thirty minutes.
Okay, thanks.
You owe me eighteen bucks, arbus.
Snooze, ropopose, sleep all...
Night all... and you didn't put this on your list.
But I liked it.
I thought it was good.
- Sleeping all.
- Just what I needed.
Are we gonna work on this together?
That is, what you said.
These are just gonna put you to sleep.
A chance to dream.
- But you didn't read the label's.
- Yes I did.
This is how you write?
I thought that all city writers...
- Just got sauced and then wrote in some kind of trance
- We do... we do but...
There is a bulletproof ending out there and I know just the guy to get me there...
Hey do you know a doctor in town that can give me prescription for a real..
Real one?
I can't do that.
I'm a public official.
Twilight lights.
By Bobby LaGrange.
Her skin was as fresh as cream, floating up from butter...
Under the lace negligee she liked to tease me with.
What keeps bringing you back here?
I'm trying to solve a mystery.
I'm waiting for you, my friend.
Here, by her tomb.
- After you.
- Thank you.
And you are...
Edgar Allan poe, so..
If you...
How can I help?
Well...
I don't have no ending.
Did you know the deacons once corresponded with me...
Concerning the technique... of writing the ending first.
And working backwards.
What did you need?
Length?
40 to 50 lines... per page.
200 page minimum.
- Providence?
- Beauty.
- The tone?
- They'll tell you.
These points being settled...
- Shall we consider a reframe?
- I like it.
The bell tower is becoming to me.
A reframe must be brief.
In my own work, my most famous...
It's lead me at once to a single word is the best...
I'm afraid.
Never more.
The difficulty arose from the presumption that the word...
Must be monopolously be spoken by a human being.
Then immediately arose the idea of a, a non reasoning creature capable of speech...
And, then very naturally a parrot suggested itself.
But it was superceded forthwith immediately by a raven as equally...
Capable of speech, but as a bird of ill omen...
Infinitely more in keeping within intent to turn.
Is all this worth the price of that very good bottle of Irish whisky?
Yes, of course, please continue..
So, I asked myself...
Of all the melancholy topics...
What according to the universal understanding of mankind is the most tragic?
Death.
And when is this most tragic of melancholy topics...
Most poetical?
When it most loosely alludes itself... to beauty.
The death therefore, of a beautiful girl...
Is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world.
Equally it is beyond there that the lips best suited for the topic are those of the man...
Who loved her.
So...
I had to combine these two ideas...
Of the lover lamented his deceased mistress...
And the raven' continuously using the word "nevermore"
in a poem of about 100 lines.
And "nevermore" of conclusion of each dancer...
In a poem of melancholy tone.
How do you uh, find the ending?
Your story is a tragedy.
It happened here at the old chikering hotel where I once slept.
There were many children in the town.
Orphans some wares, the lost children.
And before long they were taking in to protection of pastor Alan Floyd.
He was a kindly man, loved his kids.
And everyone agreed that he took very good care of them.
He taught them cataclysm, and love of God and goodness.
And one night it happened.
One of his children was missing.
And that's when it came out.
Who isn't here?
Peter?
Where did...
He didn't go across the lake.
Never ever go with the people across of the lake.
This is very important.
They are like, like, like... vermin.
Unclean, those, those fiends across the lake.
They are... the undead..
They are vampires.
He took care of them and fed them.
Anointed them with the juices of spoilage, and sinkfoil and wolfsbane.
Anointed them against evil.
- Turn your head.
- Thank you...
That's right.
There we go.
Make sure that you be nice and safe.
Someday you will wearing...
Nylon stockings.
- Where the hell is he?
- What are you doing with my mom's ouija board?
- Have you ever seen one of these?
- What would you do with that?
Innovation is what made the detective story and Charlie Chan entertaining.
Bobby LaGrange...
is an innovative detective.
After you, sir.
That, ouija board.
We are in close proximity...
To the deceased.
And the killer is probably still in the area.
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this in a morgue.
Dim the old lights..
Hello.
- Do we know you?
- Yes, it is.
You're doing that, I can feel you.
- No I'm not.
- Shut up!
H..
I..
M.
Him.
It wants you
okay, do we know you?
I...
Am... her.
I am.
Arbus, what was that?
Ask her, let go watch.
Who killed you?
B...
- Sheriff, you're doing that.
I can feel it.
- Am not.
Who killed you?
B...
The evil kids at the lake.
They are evil.
And that flamingo kid, he's the one that infects them.
He's a vampire.
Is he?
'Yes'.
Come on, arbus.
Keep your gun hidden.
- You must be thirsty?
- Exactly.
- I'm looking for Flamingo.
- He is right back here.
When the sky is low and heavy, weighing as a lid...
On the groaning spirit, falling prey to long boredom...
Educated..
You know baudelaire.
I know life man.
And I know the dreams of baudelaire.
And he from the horizon, the entire circle embracing...
A dark day for our poor, even sadder than the nights.
I was hoping you could help me find this missing girl.
She is 12 or 13.
There are a lot of girls here.
You know, people are saying what's going on up here is... evil.
Are you worried about that?
Look around you.
Does this look evil to you?
Look at that moon.
It is beautiful.
I have been worried...
It has been 3 days since we've seen her..
She's just a little kid that I take care of, but
I'm worried that something has happened to her.
Arbus.
Damn it.
You?
You're out off uniform?
And you're here on unofficial business.
What the hell are you doing here?
He said you were okay with it.
He gave me 20 bucks.
Mr. collaborator.
I thought we were a team, all the way through this investigation.
Bobby LaGrange does not like to be tricked.
Nor does he like being made a fool out of.
The famous flamingo ..My..
My..
My the lady killer.
Arbus, arrest this murderer.
He's like that... either coming or going.
Or he's already gone.
- Those are the real keys for the...
- These are them...
- These are the official keys.
- Wow, that's amazing.
- This is to the clock tower?
- Yes, really?
Hey give me, give me that.
Where are you going with that?
- Come on, just to see.
- What?
You don't want to go up there.
That's odd, I was up here yesterday...
- And I didn't have a hard time with this lock at all.
- Yesterday?
Uh, maybe it was last week.
- It worked?
- Maybe it was the week before last.
Let me try.
- Here.
- Thanks.
What the hell was that?
You tell me you ever notice anything like that when you were up here?
You're not going up there.
This place is haunted.
Didn't you know that?
- What's that smell?
- The devil.
The devil lives up there.
You're gonna get it all over yourself.
I'm going out.
Goodbye.
Come with us daddy...
Come with us daddy help me, daddy...
Come with us daddy.
Help me...
Help me... daddy
- Listen,
- What is that?
Are they evil?
No.
No.
Tell me who killed her?
Tell me.
You say that you want to know..
But do you?
- I want to know the truth.
- There are consequences.
What choice do I have?
- Tell me all of the story.
- As you wish, my friend.
There happened events just make you ashamed to remember.
- Please.
- Thank you, it's a sharp of knife.
I wanna know what the secret ingredient is.
We're going to have special lemonade for everybody.
That's right... good job.
- This stuff stinks.
- Careful.
You cut your finger.
- Here you go, Alice.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
There you go.
Wait.
Don't drink the lemonade, he put something in it.
- No, stop.
- No I would like lemonade, Virginia
Virginia, fine.
Enough, ..Stand still.
Virginia, is being very...
Very sick.
And we're all going to have some lemonade, it's delicious and sweet... taste it.
- Stay... stay... stay here.
- What are you doing?
Then he made a fateful decision.
Rather than have his children's souls be damned as vampires he drugged their lemonade, and slit their throats.
Can you make him stop?
Do something..
Death of beauty.
One child tried to save herself.
Virginia?
You're playing our favorite game, huh?
I'll find you.
Got you.
Virginia.
Virginia.
One way to God.
One, one, one way to God.
I got you.
Once the monster caught her he put her in chains in the vault.
No.
You must stop screaming.
I told you...
God wants you to meet mom.
That's right.
Scream all what you want, even God can't hear you now.
One road, one way to God..
All in Jesus name.
During the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty...
I loved her..
Not as the living and breathing Virginia...
But as the Virginia of the dream.
You see...
Dear friend...
She was my young cousin...
My beloved wife.
Her name was Virginia.
But I gave her many names.
Lenor bernice.
The lady gaia.
Madenasha.
Annabelle Lee.
Alianora.
I assume that I am your partner?
...
Open the door, wake up.
Wake up.
- Open the door, hall.
- Alright, alright...
Hang on.
- Wait 'til you see this.
- What?
I subscribed to "writers weekly."
And this just in...
Says that you took a 10,000 dollar advance on a project called "the vampire executions."
No, no..
That was money for some old writes.
And that money already went to my wife.
That's a mistake.
But I was thinking, I do like "the vampire executions"...
By hall Baltimore and Bobby LaGrange.
Give me my $5,000 dollar now.
There's not gonna be any money exchanged until we get to the story right?
- We gotta get to the end.
- The end?
The end?
It's a who done it.
Like every other murder mystery.
- Just let me wake up.
- It comes to who did it.
- Okay.
- What's the matter with you?
- You're foregoing your greatest asset.
- Yeah...
What's that?
Bobby LaGrange, the detective..
You gotta take Bobby LaGrange and use him much more throughout the entire story...
Because he could solve the crime himself..
Clearly it's the work of a serial killer.
Someone wants to silence the girls, on the other side of the lake.
Because, they fried a sick mind.
And then they sizzle them, because of some psycho hocus pocus condition...
That condemns them to being the evil sluts that they are.
And that is what's in a sick mind.
You think so, Bobby?
You think they're uh, they're evil sluts?
- Whom?
- The young girls.
Shit yes, they're all into dark things...
Every one of them they worship death...
And sex.
What do you think?
Oh no you don't...
No, not Bobby LaGrange...
Them.
Those devil worshiping whores on the other side of the loch.
Shit yes, they are all in dark thing every one of them.
They worship death and sex.
They were just too saucy for their own good.
You know, they have that white flash with the devil inside them.
That little spice you can't stop, thinking about.
- It's not me.
- It's not me.
- It's them.
- It's them...
Flash of the devil.
I saved their souls.
You...
You don't touch me.
Do not touch me.
Tearing it out.
- Old bastard.
- Forgive me...
Forgive me for seeking pleasure outside of the company...
Cast me another way for my spirit.
Perhaps, it takes the dirt to be boiled, only here alone?
With all of these things together, thrown...
- Burn it... she shall...
- Flame-proof, bullet-proof.
I can't even look at the cliff, without trembling.
This little cliff?
Wait, wait.
- Do you dare to go further?
- What are you talking about, tell me the ending.
If you don't stop now, every word that flows from your pen will be your your own tale.
You.
You are the ending you seek.
How can I stop now when it's so close to the end?
Then it's time to face the truth.
To end this story, there is no other way.
I am so ashamed, I should cry that's my little girl.
That's my daughter.
She wanted me to go with her friends.
I thought they were little boats...
I thought they were childrens boats.
I didn't know they were speedboats.
I couldn't guide them.
I was too drunk to wake up that morning.
I was with a woman.
I am so ashamed.
I could have gone, i set the clock, but it was the wrong time so the alarm didn't go off.
I could have been there... but been there, maybe still...
I'm so ashamed...
So ashamed.
Than maybe if I would have been there she would...
I could have been there, i should have been there.
This little girl.
We share this little ghost, my friend.
Our work must be the grave that we prepare for it's lovely tenant.
Oh God...
Help me... help me, daddy..
'Bullet proof'.
You delivered the goods here.
I'm telling you, meat on the bone.
- You think so, Sam?
- I do.
Hall Baltimore, master of witchcraft, no more.
Never more.
There was once upon a time a town, not far from a big city.
A road ran through, but there were only a few businesses.
A coffee shop, a hardware store, a sheriff's office.
And all kinds of people..
vagrants, runaway teens... religious fanatics, retired seniors who... well, it was a town of those who want to be left alone... and so they were.
Sheriff, Bobby LaGrange, had been there for years... also made wood novelties.
But the most astonishing thing about the town was... an old belfry, that had a clock tower with seven faces.
You could see the time from anywhere in the town of Swann Valley.
the faces persistently told different times.
No question, something evil was abiding there.
Perhaps it was because of the terrible murder that happened years before.
Too terrible to talk about.
But which haunted the town.
Or perhaps it was those teenagers who gathered across the lake.
Some people thought they did bad things.
Worshiped Satan.
The way they dressed, the music they played... and their mysterious leader known only as Flamingo.
A seducer of innocent youth... and some said... far worse.
It was at this certain time...
that a third string writer... of popular fiction, Hall Baltimore... drove into Swann Valley.
On his book signing tour... of another of his series of novels... about witchcraft.
Excuse me, do you know where the bookstore is?
- There's no bookstore around here.
- Great.
Have you ever read a Hall Baltimore thriller?
No, thanks.
Have you ever read Hall Baltimore thriller?
No...
Who is Hall Baltimore?
- I am he.
- Oh.
Nice to meet you.
- and you are...
- Stacey.
- Oh excuse me, sorry.
- Hi Stacey. bye Stacey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You sell weapons?
- Uh, no weapons, just ammunition.
- Pistols?
- Ammunition?
- Yes.
- Knives?
- Isle 2.
The Hall Baltimore.
I'll take one.
- Could you uh... autograph it?
- sure.
"To Bobby LaGrange."
"To Bobby LaGrange.
Best witches.
Hall Baltimore."
How does it feel to be the bargain basement Stephen King?
Not too wonderful.
Well, you know, I uh...
I write horror stories myself.
You don't say?
And you're the sheriff here in the town?
40 years.
You wouldn't uh, or Would you, mind reading some of my stuff?
I'd be much obliged.
You know We had a mass murder.
A while back.
A lot of folks think the town's haunted
Well, I'm, I'm uh...
just wrapping it up here in the town... and then I'm gonna be on my way.
You a mystery writer and you're not interested in mass murder?
.
No.
you come with me right now... and take a look at the doozie I got in the morgue.
- You got a doozie in the morgue?
- Yes sir.
- now?
- Yes, sir.
There's a story in it.
- I know what this must look like...
- It is like a wood...
Ow!
Jesus!
.
Let me ask you a question.
- How long have you worked here?
- Well
You don't run a gurney with a dead person on over my foot!
Sorry, sheriff.
Is this a common occurrence in Swann Valley?
It's happened before.
serial killing it appears to be leaves a calling card as a wooden stake.
- I don't want to see her face.
- I don't blame you.
I mean, it's really a tragedy.
She's just a poor girl.
- Arbus?
Arbus!
- Yeah?
- Alright, alright.
- You're on the clock.
- Do you know who she is?
- This girl?
We get all kind here vagrants, runaways..
worse, those kids out at the lake.
All kinds.
How'd you like to collaborate on a book about this?
You and me?
Are you gonna...
leave that stake in her like that?
Howdy.
I'd Like to fill my thermos full of coffee, please.
Okay.
Edgar Allan Poe slept in this town?
- Sure did.
- At the old Chickering Hotel way back when.
- Chickering Hotel...
Thanks.
- Have a good day.
With my respect sir.
I want to write something I do.
I want to write something for me.
something personal.
Does that make any sense?
I have to break the spell of this downward spiral.
There's only one way to do it and I'm trying to do it.
I'm not gonna write another witch book.
I told them that... and, and, and that's it, I'm gonna do something for me.
You've done it before
When you weren't drinking.
Before Vicky's accident.
I can't rush these things.
You can do this.
I...
I know what...
I know what you mean about you just have to do it one more time.
Just... write the damn thing, then you can...
then you can take the time and write what you really want to write.
I understand, I get it. you know I do.
Did you call Sam?
Did you tell him we need an advance?
Well I did and it was extremely humiliating.
And I'm not gonna write another witch story.
- You're having a holiday?
- No I'm...
I...
- and I'm stuck here...
- Listen to me,
-... trying to put people off.
- can't you?
come up with magic numbers...
to make it all work out.
- Pretend there's nothing wrong...
- It's not good...
-... and put food on the table.
- Denise will you listen to me?
You can't, you can't speak to me like this... just grow up... grow up!
People always ask me, "How do you know so much about witches?"... and I tell them, "'Cuz I married one."
- Hey.
- Hello.
Where do you come from?
Just down the road.
You past me.
You looking at my teeth?
No I'm not, I just didn't know where you came from.
I am very self conscious about my buck teeth.
Show me.
Your teeth are fine.
It's those braces.
- Anyway I hate them.
- No, they're fine.
You'll grow into them.
They call me Vampira, because of these teeth.
- but you can call me V.
- V. that's nice.
- What's your real name?
- Virginia.
Virginia.
You're about 13?
Yeah, I'm 12.
But I look older because I'm tall.
I know who you are.
You wrote those witch stories.
And you're here to sign books over at the hardware store.
I love your books.
Especially the part where Elizabeth says,
"Forsake me never, for I will entice you from my grave."
That's my favorite part.
Thanks, I like your look.
Oh... yeah.
It's just the way I dress.
- You scared of me yet?
- What?
Yes.
A little.
That clock it chimed midnight three times already.
Keeping track of time around here is pointless.
That's why I missed your book signing.
Well that old hotel is open.
Come on I'll buy you a soda... sweetie
I have a girl your age.
No, I don't think that a particularly good idea.
Why not?
That's what I had to go to the hardware store and talk to you about.
My story.
- Well tell it to me now.
- No, I can't.
Come on.
We're open.
Come in.
I... went for walk, I guess I got lost.
- Hey what happened to that little girl?
- What little girl?
- Is the restaurant open?
- Restaurant's always open.
What with that old clock tower and all those faces, you can get breakfast anytime.
Yes.
- Well, Mr...
- Baltimore.
Damned clock.
That clock has never told the correct time.
Just you wait.
You're gonna be very surprised.
Bell's the important thing, and it's working beautifully.
- Better than before.
- I'll just uh, have a beer.
Melvin is the belfry custodian, assigned to the big clock at church.
It's a hopeless job.
And a real burden.
That old mechanism's on it's last legs .
I go up there about every day, or most.
Those seven faces they look at me like I was the one who invented daylight savings time.
You know who came up with daylight savings time, don't you?
Hitler.
And, you know who supports it now?
Doctors.
And you know why?
Golf.
They want more time to golf.
That's what it's all about.
You can't change time.
Time changes you.
Don't you agree?
What's your position on daylight savings time?
- I've never really thought about it.
- What have you been thinking about?
- That's the grave.
- Grave?
Oh you can walk on it.
Don't worry.
The whole floor is a grave.
It is?
There are twelve children buried right down there.
13 children murdered in cold blood.
Well, actually he's right.
It is an even dozen, but one got away and she was damned.
- When was that?
- Oh, a long Time ago.
The clock is fixed.
The clock is fixed.
Ha, the clock is fixed.
The clock is fixed.
Got you, devil.
- She drew blood.
- Suck it out... suck it out, suck it out.
- Goddamn her...
- Hey write it down.
- What time did she bite you?
4 o'clock.
- It isn't 4 o'clock.
- The clock says four o'clock.
- You've got to be kidding me?
She's the devil.
It's the dead little kids.
You?
Why are you here?
- what has she told you?
- Nothing.
What should she tell me?
Go away, old man...
you know what you did.
Children... hurry.
The moon is going down...
time for nap.
Come on.
Come along now, come on.
my God, I'm lost.
Maybe this is what I need, ...this story.
Where are you going?
Help me.
You?
My god...
Edgar Poe.
show me the way.
Hall, wake up.
- Are you, I know you're there.
- What?
- Are you awake?
- It wasn't me.
It's me.
This is your wife.
Hello?
Hall, wake up.
Are you, I know you're there.
- What's the matter?
- Are you awake?
It's me.
What's the matter?
Everything okay?
This is your wife.
Yeah, I know who you are.
I didn't, well...
I need a second.
What's, oh my god.
What have you done?
Yeah?
That?
- do you know how much it's worth?
- Yeah, I do.
160,000 dollars.
No, it's worth a lot more than that.
It's priceless.
You shouldn't even be touching it.
How did you get into my safe?
Just calm down.
Please stop, just... just...
whatever you're doing, just stop and put it down.
That's really not a joke.
You think it's.
I don't think it's funny.
It's a nice book though eh?
Yes, Whitman only had... there's only four of those in private hands okay.
Do you understand what that means?
- Do you..
He set the type himself.
- Do you think I'm joking?
- please.
- you know what...
I think you care more this old book than you do your own family.
- You need the gloves for that.
- You Know what?
Get the advance or you can kiss it good bye.
- Please.
- Don't make me have to do this.
I don't want to...
I have to.
- Hello.
I'm looking for...
- Mrs. LaGrange is sleeping.
Quiet.
Oh, sorry.
I'd like to know if you have any information on the old Chickering Hotel?
I'll check the files.
Thank you
Swann Valley, sheriff's office please.
one moment.
Your number is 393 229 39 23 .
do you wish to be connected?
Yes.
Sheriff's office, we're closed.
Yes, hi, it's me, You remember me, the writer.
I'm here at the window.
I'm gonna go to the front door.
Alright.
- We're closed.
- Can I talk to you?
Look sheriff says nothing happens as long as that thing is in here.
- Oh, where's the sheriff?
- It's Sunday.
He's at the church.
It's a mystery, he's not very religious.
Listen, listen, uh... what time did you say the country coroner was coming to take the stake out?
I didn't say nothing about nothing
Um, uh, somebody said it was this week... somebody said.
But it wasn't me.
Can I, can I come in?
Okay but look you can't touch anything.
It's all evidence.
Don't touch anything, you got it?
It's my responsibility, and I don't want that guy yelling at me, I'm sick of it.
- Hello.
- Yeah, can I talk to the sheriff?
Just a minute.
Bobby.
Telephone.
Yeah.
Hey Sheriff, I got that writer fella from out of town here at the office.
He doesn't know it's Sunday?
Let me talk to him.
Hey Bobby, it's Hall Baltimore.
Yeah I couldn't get your story and the image of that poor dead girl out of my mind.
- Really?
- Yes, I dreamt about it all night.
I'd like to write that book with you.
So, you're the sheriff and you make bat houses?
Yes, and that's a bird house.
Totally different.
The bats and the birds know which is which.
Well normally I write about witchcraft but... what are vampires but witches that suck blood.
Entirely different.
We haven't really had one here.
There are no witches here, since as long as I can remember.
I could ask my sister.
She's older than Hades.
Welcome to my office.
Come on have a seat.
Imagine this.
Written by...
Hall Baltimore and Bobby LaGrange.
Sweet.
Or, Hall Baltimore with an idea by Bobby LaGrange.
What do you mean an idea by?
I got a hell of a lot more than an idea by.
- I got a great character.
- Yeah, who?
- Bobby LaGrange.
- Calm` down.
Tell me what you got.
Shoot.
I call it, The Vampire Executions... and that will sell.
Not bad.
Go on.
The girl, who is she?
is she just a runaway?
Or just some 12 or 13 year old girl... that looks much older than she really is.
A Vagrant?
Homeless?
- Why the wooden stake?
- Yeah, why?
What, did that kill her?
Or was it something that was added later?
As a calling card for the real killer?
You see, one end of it was worn smooth.
No fingerprints.
And then it was pressed into her... slowly.
Not jab, not stab.
Almost as if it was done by some kind of a machine.
- A machine?
- Yeah.
That's why I call it The Vampire Executions.
I think she was killed by...
an electric chair... for vampires.
An execution device, designed especially by and for vampires.
That's different...
I wonder what that would look like.
Well I thought of that.
I made a model.
- Ready?
- Ready
How about that?
Watch this.
You love it?
- How can I help you, Hall.
- Hey Sam... remember you said if I come with a bulletproof idea, you'd give me an advance?
- Another advance.
- Yeah, another, more.
A bulletproof idea comes with meat on the bone.
Not a lot of fog on the lake kind of crap, you know.
Yeah, well no one can mix metaphors quite like you Sam.
Here's the title, right... just listen The Vampire Executions.
vampires huh?
And the main character get this...
she's a little girl, a murdered girl.
- Beautiful.
- Beautiful, yeah, but she's just a kid.
No, no, no, I meant it's beautiful that she gets murdered.
But it's gotta have a lot of story.
Not a lot of style bullshit.
So tell me, how does this execution bit play out?
I, I will find out.
I, I mean there's a great... great twist ending.
With heart.
With tons of heart, and I'll get you a complete outline in the morning.
But you gotta get me a check to Denise right away.
It's...
I'm not kidding around, in fact... in fact the bank wire transfer would be better.
- It's an emergency.
- You know, you know, I'm thinking... it's not bulletproof.
But Hall Baltimore, master of witchcraft doing a vampire story...
- It's not bad.
- Not bad at all.
- If it's got an ending.
- It's got an ending.
- A bulletproof ending.
- Bulletproof
But Sam, you gotta tide my wife over okay?
This is why I'm doing it alright?
25 grand.
Okay, you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna wire Denise 10,000 dollars.
25.
That, that's great.
I really appreciate it.
As I said, I'm gonna wire Denise 10,000 dollars... but I need the outline in the morning or I'm gonna stop payment.
- Sam?
- And no fog on the lake.
The night was... humid.
The night was... cloudy.
Fog.
A Mist... a mist descends... on the, on the lake Mini, Mini, Mini...
Unwanipanuki.
The fog... floated out like
Virginia's silent... dream.
No, that sucks.
The fog on the lake, the fog on the...
The fog on the lake... just to torture Sam.
The scent floats out like... tears.
On a whale's ass?
No.
The fog on the lake... the flake.
The straight edge razor.
The fog on the lake reminds me of my first wife.
It dissipated with time.
I'd lost my mind.
And now I have a lisp.
And now I'm suddenly turning into a black basketball player.
she... was...
I/m typing as a gay basketball player from the sixties.
I like short shorts.
They are revealing, but it's comfortable.
It helps me jump.
There was no fog on the lake.
Swann Valley, sheriff's department.
Deputy Arbus speaking.
Arbus, the writer fella told me to go do a bunch of errands for him... well, he's not back here at his motel.
If you see him, tell him I'll wait another thirty minutes...
- and that's it...
I got to go.
- Alright, sheriff.
Why isn't the door locked, Arbus?
Yeah, I left it open for you, PJ.
What happened to your diet?
I was wondering when you were gonna get here with my hamburgers.
Feel like to playing some cards?
sure, but when are you gonna pay up?
- Hey PJ, get the chord there would you.
- Okay.
Don't ever walk into a morgue like that unannounced.
- My heart can't handle it.
- Sorry, I knocked.
Yeah, well, sheriff's over at your motel... and he said I'll only be here another thirty minutes.
Okay, thanks.
You owe me eighteen bucks, Arbus.
And Snooze, Ropopose, Sleep all...
Night all... and you didn't put this on your list.
But I liked it.
I thought it was good.
- Sleeping All.
- Just what I needed.
Are we gonna work on this together?
That is, what you said.
These are just goanna put you to sleep.
A chance to dream.
- But you didn't read the label's.
- Yes I did.
This is how you write?
I thought that all city writers... just got sauced and then wrote in some kind of trance.
We do... we do but...
There is a bulletproof ending out there and I know just the guy to get me there...
Hey do you know a doctor in town that can give me prescription for a real... real one?
I can't do that.
I'm a public official.
Twilight Lights.
By Bobby LaGrange.
Her skin was as fresh as cream, floating up from butter... under the lace negligee she liked to tease me with.
What keeps bringing you back here?
I'm trying to solve a mystery.
I'm waiting for you, my friend.
Here, by her tomb.
- After you.
- Thank you.
And you are...
Edgar Allan Poe, so... if you...
How can I help?
well...
I don't have no ending.
Did you know the deacons once corresponded with me... concerning the technique of writing the ending first, and working backwards.
What did you need?
Length?
40 to 50 lines... per page.
200 page minimum.
- Providence?
- Beauty.
- The tone?
- They'll tell you.
These points being settled...
- shall we consider the reframe?
- I like it.
The bell tower is becoming to me.
A reframe must be brief.
In my own work, my most famous... it's lead me at once to a single word is the best, I'm afraid.
Never more.
The difficulty arose from the presumption that the word... must be monopolously be spoken by a human being.
then immediately arose the idea of a, a non reasoning creature capable of speech... and, then very naturally a parrot suggested itself.
But it was superseded forthwith immediately by a raven as equally... capable of speech, but as a bird of ill omen... infinitely more in keeping within intent to turn.
Is all this worth the price of that very good bottle of Irish whisky?
Yes, of course, please continue...
So, I asked myself... of all the melancholy topics... what according to the universal understanding of mankind is the most tragic?
Death.
And when is this most tragic of melancholy topics... most poetical?
When it most loosely alludes itself... to beauty.
The death therefore, of a beautiful girl ... is unquestionly the most poetical topic in the world.
Equally it is beyond there that the lips best suited for the topic are those of the man...
who loved her.
So...
I had to combine these two ideas... of the lover lamented his deceased mistress... and the raven' continuously using the word "Nevermore"
in a poem of about 100 lines.
And "nevermore" of conclusion of each dancer... in a poem of melancholy tone.
How do you uh, find the ending?
Your story is a tragedy.
It happened here at the old Chikering hotel where I once slept.
There were many children in the town.
Orphans some wares, the lost children.
And before long they were taking in to protection of pastor Alan Floyd.
He was a kindly man, loved his kids.
And everyone agreed that he took very good care of them.
He taught them cataclysm, and love of god and goodness.
And one night it happened.
One of his children was missing.
And that's when it came out.
Who isn't here?
Peter?
Where did... he didn't go across the lake.
Never ever go with the people across of the lake.
This is very important.
They are like, like, like... vermin.
Unclean, those, those fiends across the lake.
They are... the undead...
They are vampires.
He took care of them and fed them.
Anointed them with the juices of spoilage, and sinkfoil and wolfsbane.
Anointed them against evil.
- Turn your head.
- Thank you...
That's right.
There we go.
Make sure that you be nice and safe.
Someday you will wear...
nylon stockings.
Where the hell is he?
What are you doing with my mom's Ouija board?
- Have you ever seen one of these?
- What would you do with that?
Innovation is what made the detective story and Charlie Chan entertaining.
Bobby LaGrange...
is an innovative detective.
After you, sir.
That, ouija board.
We are in close proximity... to the deceased.
And the killer is probably still in the area.
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this in a morgue.
Dim the old lights...
Hello.
- Do we know you?
- Yes, it is.
You're doing that, I can feel you.
- No I'm not
- Shut up!
H...
I...
M.
Him.
It wants you
Okay, do we know you?
I... am... her.
I am.
Arbus, what was that?
Ask her, let go watch.
Who killed you?
B...
- Sheriff, you're doing that.
I can feel it.
- Am not.
Who killed you?
B...
The evil kids at the lake.
They are evil.
And that Flamingo kid, he's the one that infects them.
He's a vampire.
Is he?
'Yes'.
Come on, Arbus.
Keep your gun hidden.
- You must be thirsty?
- Exactly
- I'm looking for Flamingo.
- He is right back here.
When the sky is low and heavy, weighing as a lid... on the groaning spirit, falling prey to long boredom...
Educated... you know BAUDELAIRE.
I know life man.
And I know the dreams of BAUDELAIRE.
and he from the horizon, the entire circle embracing... a dark day for our poor, even sadder than the nights.
I was hoping you could help me find this missing girl.
She is 12 or 13.
There are a lot of girls here.
You know, people are saying what's going on up here is... evil.
Are you worried about that?
Look around you.
Does this look evil to you?
Look at that moon.
It is beautiful.
I have been worried... it has been 3 days since we've seen her...
She's just a little kid that I take care of, but I'm worried that something has happened to her.
Arbus.
Damn it.
You?
You're out off uniform?
And you're here on unofficial business.
What the hell are you doing here?
he said you were okay with it.
He gave me 20 bucks.
Mr. Collaborator.
I thought we were a team, all the way through this investigation.
Bobby LaGrange does not like to be tricked.
Nor does he like being made a fool out of.
The famous Flamingo ... my... my... my the lady killer.
Arbus, arrest this murderer.
He's like that... either coming or going.
Or he's already gone.
- Those are the real keys for the...
- These are them... .
- these are the official keys.
- Wow, that's amazing.
- This is to the clock tower?
- Yes, really?
Hey give me, give me that.
Where are you going with that?
- Come on, just to see.
- What?
You don't want to go up there.
That's odd, I was up here yesterday... and I didn't have a hard time with this lock at all.
Yesterday?
Uh, maybe it was last week.
- It worked?
- Maybe it was the week before last.
Let me try.
- Here.
- Thanks.
What the hell was that?
You tell me you ever notice anything like that when you were up here?
You're not going up there.
This place is haunted.
Didn't you know that?
- What's that smell?
- The devil.
The devil lives up there.
You're gonna get it all over yourself.
I'm going out.
Goodbye.
come with us daddy...
come with us daddy
Help me, daddy...
Come with us daddy.
Help me...
Help me... daddy
- listen,
- What is that?
Are they evil?
No.
No.
tell me who killed her?
... tell me.
You say that you want to know...
but do you?
- I want to know the truth.
- There are consequences.
What choice do I have?
- Tell me all of the story.
- As you wish, my friend.
There happened events just make you ashamed to remember.
- Please.
- Thank you, it's a sharp of knife.
I wanna know what the secret ingredient is.
We're going to have special lemonade for everybody.
That's right... good job.
- This stuff stinks.
- Careful.
You cut your finger.
- Here you go, Alice.
-Thank you.
You're welcome.
There you go.
Don't drink the lemonade, he put something in it.
- No, stop.
- No I would like `lemonade, Virginia
Virginia, fine.
Enough, ... stand still.
Virginia, is being very...
very sick.
And we're all going to have some lemonade, it's delicious and sweet... taste it.
- Stay... stay... stay here.
- What are you doing?
Then he made a fateful decision.
Rather than have his children's souls be damned as vampires he drugged their lemonade, and slit their throats.
Can you make him stop?
Do something...
Death of beauty.
One child tried to save herself.
Virginia?
You're playing our favorite game, huh?
I'll find you.
Got you.
Virginia.
Virginia.
One way to God.
One, one, one way to God.
I got you.
Once the monster caught her he put her in chains in the vault.
No.
You must stop screaming.
I told you...
God wants you to meet mom.
That's right. scream all what you want,
Even God can't hear you now.
One road, one way to God...
One road, one way to God...
All in Jesus name.
During the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty...
I loved her... not as the living and breathing Virginia... but as the Virginia of the dream.
You see... dear friend... she was my young cousin... my beloved wife.
her name was Virginia.
but I gave her many names.
Lenor...
Bernice.
The lady Gaia.
Madenasha.
Annabelle Lee.
Alianora.
I assume that I am your partner?
...
Open the door, wake up.
Wake up.
- Open the door, Hall.
- Alright, alright... hang on.
- Wait 'til you see this.
- What?
I subscribed to "Writers Weekly."
and this just in... says that you took a 10,000 dollar advance on a project called "The Vampire Executions."
No, no... that was money for some old writes.
And that money already went to my wife.
that's a mistake.
But I was thinking, I do like "The Vampire Executions"... by Hall Baltimore and Bobby LaGrange.
give me my $5,000 dollar now.
There's not gonna be any money exchanged until we get to the story right?
- We gotta get to the end.
- The end?
The end?
It's a who done it.
Like every other murder mystery.
- Just let me wake up.
- It comes to who did it.
- Okay.
- What's the matter with you?
- You're foregoing your greatest asset.
- Yeah... what's that?
Bobby LaGrange, the detective...
You gotta take Bobby LaGrange and use him much more throughout the entire story... because he could solve the crime himself... clearly it's the work of a serial killer.
Someone wants to silence the girls, on the other side of the lake.
because, they fried a sick mind.
And then they sizzle them, because of some psyco hocus pocus condition... that condemns them to being the evil sluts that they are.
And that is what's in a sick mind.
You think so, Bobby?
You think they're uh, they're evil sluts?
- whom?
- The young girls.
Shit yes, they're all into dark things... every one of them they worship death...
and sex.
What do you think?
Oh no you don't...
No, not Bobby LaGrange...
them.
Those devil worshiping whores on the other side of the loch.
Shit Yes, they are all in dark thing, every one of them.
They worship death and sex.
They were just too saucy for their own good.
You know, they have that white flash with the devil inside them.
That little spice you can't stop, thinking about.
- It's not me.
- It's not me.
- It's them.
- It's the... flash of the devil.
I saved their souls
You... you don't touch me.
Do not touch me. tearing it out.
- Old, old bastard.
- Forgive me... forgive me for seeking pleasure outside of the company... cast me another way for my spirit.
perhaps, it takes the dirt to be boiled, only here alone?
With all of these things together, thrown...
- will burn it...
- Flame-proof, bullet-proof.
I can't even look at the cliff, without trembling.
This little cliff?
Wait, wait.
Do you dare to go further?
What are you talking about, tell me the ending.
If you don't stop now, every word ... that flows from your pen will be your your own tale.
You.
You are the ending you seek.
How can I stop now when it's so close to the end?
Then it's time to face the truth.
To end this story, there is no other way.
I am so ashamed, I should cry That's my little girl.
That's my daughter.
She wanted me to go with her friends.
I thought they were little boats... .
I thought they were children's boats.
I didn't know they were speedboats.
I couldn't guide them.
I was too drunk to wake up that morning.
I was with a woman.
I am so ashamed.
I could have gone, I set the clock, but it was the wrong time So the alarm didn't go off.
I could have been there... but been there, maybe still...
I'm so ashamed... so ashamed.
Than maybe if I would have been there she would...
I could have been there, I should have been there.
This little girl.
We share this little ghost, my friend.
Our work must be the grave that we prepare for it's lovely tenant.
Oh God...
Help me... help me, Daddy...
'Bullet Proof'.
You delivered the goods here.
I'm telling you, meat on the bone.
- You think so, Sam?
- I do.
Hall Baltimore, master of witchcraft, no more.
Never more.
There was once upon a time a town, not far from a big city.
A road ran through, but there were only a few businesses.
A coffee shop, a hardware store, a sheriff's office.
And all kinds of people..
vagrants, runaway teens... religious fanatics, retired seniors who... well, it was a town of those who want to be left alone... and so they were.
Sheriff, Bobby LaGrange, had been there for years... also made wood novelties.
But the most astonishing thing about the town was... an old belfry, that had a clock tower with seven faces.
You could see the time from anywhere in the town of Swann Valley.
the faces persistently told different times.
No question, something evil was abiding there.
Perhaps it was because of the terrible murder that happened years before.
Too terrible to talk about.
But which haunted the town.
Or perhaps it was those teenagers who gathered across the lake.
Some people thought they did bad things.
Worshiped Satan.
The way they dressed, the music they played... and their mysterious leader known only as Flamingo.
A seducer of innocent youth... and some said... far worse.
It was at this certain time...
that a third string writer... of popular fiction, Hall Baltimore... drove into Swann Valley.
On his book signing tour... of another of his series of novels... about witchcraft.
Excuse me, do you know where the bookstore is?
- There's no bookstore around here.
- Great.
Have you ever read a Hall Baltimore thriller?
No, thanks.
Have you ever read Hall Baltimore thriller?
No...
Who is Hall Baltimore?
- I am he.
- Oh.
Nice to meet you.
- and you are...
- Stacey.
- Oh excuse me, sorry.
- Hi Stacey. bye Stacey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You sell weapons?
- Uh, no weapons, just ammunition.
- Pistols?
- Ammunition?
- Yes.
- Knives?
- Isle 2.
The Hall Baltimore.
I'll take one.
- Could you uh... autograph it?
- sure.
"To Bobby LaGrange."
"To Bobby LaGrange.
Best witches.
Hall Baltimore."
How does it feel to be the bargain basement Stephen King?
Not too wonderful.
Well, you know, I uh...
I write horror stories myself.
You don't say?
And you're the sheriff here in the town?
40 years.
You wouldn't uh, or Would you, mind reading some of my stuff?
I'd be much obliged.
You know We had a mass murder.
A while back.
A lot of folks think the town's haunted
Well, I'm, I'm uh...
just wrapping it up here in the town... and then I'm gonna be on my way.
You a mystery writer and you're not interested in mass murder?
.
No.
you come with me right now... and take a look at the doozie I got in the morgue.
- You got a doozie in the morgue?
- Yes sir.
- now?
- Yes, sir.
There's a story in it.
- I know what this must look like...
- It is like a wood...
Ow!
Jesus!
.
Let me ask you a question.
- How long have you worked here?
- Well
You don't run a gurney with a dead person on over my foot!
Sorry, sheriff.
Is this a common occurrence in Swann Valley?
It's happened before.
serial killing it appears to be leaves a calling card as a wooden stake.
- I don't want to see her face.
- I don't blame you.
I mean, it's really a tragedy.
She's just a poor girl.
- Arbus?
Arbus!
- Yeah?
- Alright, alright.
- You're on the clock.
- Do you know who she is?
- This girl?
We get all kind here vagrants, runaways..
worse, those kids out at the lake.
All kinds.
How'd you like to collaborate on a book about this?
You and me?
Are you gonna...
leave that stake in her like that?
Howdy.
I'd Like to fill my thermos full of coffee, please.
Okay.
Edgar Allan Poe slept in this town?
- Sure did.
- At the old Chickering Hotel way back when.
- Chickering Hotel...
Thanks.
- Have a good day.
With my respect sir.
I want to write something I do.
I want to write something for me.
something personal.
Does that make any sense?
I have to break the spell of this downward spiral.
There's only one way to do it and I'm trying to do it.
I'm not gonna write another witch book.
I told them that... and, and, and that's it, I'm gonna do something for me.
You've done it before
When you weren't drinking.
Before Vicky's accident.
I can't rush these things.
You can do this.
I...
I know what...
I know what you mean about you just have to do it one more time.
Just... write the damn thing, then you can...
then you can take the time and write what you really want to write.
I understand, I get it. you know I do.
Did you call Sam?
Did you tell him we need an advance?
Well I did and it was extremely humiliating.
And I'm not gonna write another witch story.
- You're having a holiday?
- No I'm...
I...
- and I'm stuck here...
- Listen to me,
-... trying to put people off.
- can't you?
come up with magic numbers...
to make it all work out.
- Pretend there's nothing wrong...
- It's not good...
-... and put food on the table.
- Denise will you listen to me?
You can't, you can't speak to me like this... just grow up... grow up!
People always ask me, "How do you know so much about witches?"... and I tell them, "'Cuz I married one."
- Hey.
- Hello.
Where do you come from?
Just down the road.
You past me.
You looking at my teeth?
No I'm not, I just didn't know where you came from.
I am very self conscious about my buck teeth.
Show me.
Your teeth are fine.
It's those braces.
- Anyway I hate them.
- No, they're fine.
You'll grow into them.
They call me Vampira, because of these teeth.
- but you can call me V.
- V. that's nice.
- What's your real name?
- Virginia.
Virginia.
You're about 13?
Yeah, I'm 12.
But I look older because I'm tall.
I know who you are.
You wrote those witch stories.
And you're here to sign books over at the hardware store.
I love your books.
Especially the part where Elizabeth says,
"Forsake me never, for I will entice you from my grave."
That's my favorite part.
Thanks, I like your look.
Oh... yeah.
It's just the way I dress.
- You scared of me yet?
- What?
Yes.
A little.
That clock it chimed midnight three times already.
Keeping track of time around here is pointless.
That's why I missed your book signing.
Well that old hotel is open.
Come on I'll buy you a soda... sweetie
I have a girl your age.
No, I don't think that a particularly good idea.
Why not?
That's what I had to go to the hardware store and talk to you about.
My story.
- Well tell it to me now.
- No, I can't.
Come on.
We're open.
Come in.
I... went for walk, I guess I got lost.
- Hey what happened to that little girl?
- What little girl?
- Is the restaurant open?
- Restaurant's always open.
What with that old clock tower and all those faces, you can get breakfast anytime.
Yes.
- Well, Mr...
- Baltimore.
Damned clock.
That clock has never told the correct time.
Just you wait.
You're gonna be very surprised.
Bell's the important thing, and it's working beautifully.
- Better than before.
- I'll just uh, have a beer.
Melvin is the belfry custodian, assigned to the big clock at church.
It's a hopeless job.
And a real burden.
That old mechanism's on it's last legs .
I go up there about every day, or most.
Those seven faces they look at me like I was the one who invented daylight savings time.
You know who came up with daylight savings time, don't you?
Hitler.
And, you know who supports it now?
Doctors.
And you know why?
Golf.
They want more time to golf.
That's what it's all about.
You can't change time.
Time changes you.
Don't you agree?
What's your position on daylight savings time?
- I've never really thought about it.
- What have you been thinking about?
- That's the grave.
- Grave?
Oh you can walk on it.
Don't worry.
The whole floor is a grave.
It is?
There are twelve children buried right down there.
13 children murdered in cold blood.
Well, actually he's right.
It is an even dozen, but one got away and she was damned.
- When was that?
- Oh, a long Time ago.
The clock is fixed.
The clock is fixed.
Ha, the clock is fixed.
The clock is fixed.
Got you, devil.
- She drew blood.
- Suck it out... suck it out, suck it out.
- Goddamn her...
- Hey write it down.
- What time did she bite you?
4 o'clock.
- It isn't 4 o'clock.
- The clock says four o'clock.
- You've got to be kidding me?
She's the devil.
It's the dead little kids.
You?
Why are you here?
- what has she told you?
- Nothing.
What should she tell me?
Go away, old man...
you know what you did.
Children... hurry.
The moon is going down...
time for nap.
Come on.
Come along now, come on.
my God, I'm lost.
Maybe this is what I need, ...this story.
Where are you going?
Help me.
You?
My god...
Edgar Poe.
show me the way.
Hall, wake up.
- Are you, I know you're there.
- What?
- Are you awake?
- It wasn't me.
It's me.
This is your wife.
Hello?
Hall, wake up.
Are you, I know you're there.
- What's the matter?
- Are you awake?
It's me.
What's the matter?
Everything okay?
This is your wife.
Yeah, I know who you are.
I didn't, well...
I need a second.
What's, oh my god.
What have you done?
Yeah?
That?
- do you know how much it's worth?
- Yeah, I do.
160,000 dollars.
No, it's worth a lot more than that.
It's priceless.
You shouldn't even be touching it.
How did you get into my safe?
Just calm down.
Please stop, just... just...
whatever you're doing, just stop and put it down.
That's really not a joke.
You think it's.
I don't think it's funny.
It's a nice book though eh?
Yes, Whitman only had... there's only four of those in private hands okay.
Do you understand what that means?
- Do you..
He set the type himself.
- Do you think I'm joking?
- please.
- you know what...
I think you care more this old book than you do your own family.
- You need the gloves for that.
- You Know what?
Get the advance or you can kiss it good bye.
- Please.
- Don't make me have to do this.
I don't want to...
I have to.
- Hello.
I'm looking for...
- Mrs. LaGrange is sleeping.
Quiet.
Oh, sorry.
I'd like to know if you have any information on the old Chickering Hotel?
I'll check the files.
Thank you
Swann Valley, sheriff's office please.
one moment.
Your number is 393 229 39 23 .
do you wish to be connected?
Yes.
Sheriff's office, we're closed.
Yes, hi, it's me, You remember me, the writer.
I'm here at the window.
I'm gonna go to the front door.
Alright.
- We're closed.
- Can I talk to you?
Look sheriff says nothing happens as long as that thing is in here.
- Oh, where's the sheriff?
- It's Sunday.
He's at the church.
It's a mystery, he's not very religious.
Listen, listen, uh... what time did you say the country coroner was coming to take the stake out?
I didn't say nothing about nothing
Um, uh, somebody said it was this week... somebody said.
But it wasn't me.
Can I, can I come in?
Okay but look you can't touch anything.
It's all evidence.
Don't touch anything, you got it?
It's my responsibility, and I don't want that guy yelling at me, I'm sick of it.
- Hello.
- Yeah, can I talk to the sheriff?
Just a minute.
Bobby.
Telephone.
Yeah.
Hey Sheriff, I got that writer fella from out of town here at the office.
He doesn't know it's Sunday?
Let me talk to him.
Hey Bobby, it's Hall Baltimore.
Yeah I couldn't get your story and the image of that poor dead girl out of my mind.
- Really?
- Yes, I dreamt about it all night.
I'd like to write that book with you.
So, you're the sheriff and you make bat houses?
Yes, and that's a bird house.
Totally different.
The bats and the birds know which is which.
Well normally I write about witchcraft but... what are vampires but witches that suck blood.
Entirely different.
We haven't really had one here.
There are no witches here, since as long as I can remember.
I could ask my sister.
She's older than Hades.
Welcome to my office.
Come on have a seat.
Imagine this.
Written by...
Hall Baltimore and Bobby LaGrange.
Sweet.
Or, Hall Baltimore with an idea by Bobby LaGrange.
What do you mean an idea by?
I got a hell of a lot more than an idea by.
- I got a great character.
- Yeah, who?
- Bobby LaGrange.
- Calm` down.
Tell me what you got.
Shoot.
I call it, The Vampire Executions... and that will sell.
Not bad.
Go on.
The girl, who is she?
is she just a runaway?
Or just some 12 or 13 year old girl... that looks much older than she really is.
A Vagrant?
Homeless?
- Why the wooden stake?
- Yeah, why?
What, did that kill her?
Or was it something that was added later?
As a calling card for the real killer?
You see, one end of it was worn smooth.
No fingerprints.
And then it was pressed into her... slowly.
Not jab, not stab.
Almost as if it was done by some kind of a machine.
- A machine?
- Yeah.
That's why I call it The Vampire Executions.
I think she was killed by...
an electric chair... for vampires.
An execution device, designed especially by and for vampires.
That's different...
I wonder what that would look like.
Well I thought of that.
I made a model.
- Ready?
- Ready
How about that?
Watch this.
You love it?
- How can I help you, Hall.
- Hey Sam... remember you said if I come with a bulletproof idea, you'd give me an advance?
- Another advance.
- Yeah, another, more.
A bulletproof idea comes with meat on the bone.
Not a lot of fog on the lake kind of crap, you know.
Yeah, well no one can mix metaphors quite like you Sam.
Here's the title, right... just listen The Vampire Executions.
vampires huh?
And the main character get this...
she's a little girl, a murdered girl.
- Beautiful.
- Beautiful, yeah, but she's just a kid.
No, no, no, I meant it's beautiful that she gets murdered.
But it's gotta have a lot of story.
Not a lot of style bullshit.
So tell me, how does this execution bit play out?
I, I will find out.
I, I mean there's a great... great twist ending.
With heart.
With tons of heart, and I'll get you a complete outline in the morning.
But you gotta get me a check to Denise right away.
It's...
I'm not kidding around, in fact... in fact the bank wire transfer would be better.
- It's an emergency.
- You know, you know, I'm thinking... it's not bulletproof.
But Hall Baltimore, master of witchcraft doing a vampire story...
- It's not bad.
- Not bad at all.
- If it's got an ending.
- It's got an ending.
- A bulletproof ending.
- Bulletproof
But Sam, you gotta tide my wife over okay?
This is why I'm doing it alright?
25 grand.
Okay, you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna wire Denise 10,000 dollars.
25.
That, that's great.
I really appreciate it.
As I said, I'm gonna wire Denise 10,000 dollars... but I need the outline in the morning or I'm gonna stop payment.
- Sam?
- And no fog on the lake.
The night was... humid.
The night was... cloudy.
Fog.
A Mist... a mist descends... on the, on the lake Mini, Mini, Mini...
Unwanipanuki.
The fog... floated out like
Virginia's silent... dream.
No, that sucks.
The fog on the lake, the fog on the...
The fog on the lake... just to torture Sam.
The scent floats out like... tears.
On a whale's ass?
No.
The fog on the lake... the flake.
The straight edge razor.
The fog on the lake reminds me of my first wife.
It dissipated with time.
I'd lost my mind.
And now I have a lisp.
And now I'm suddenly turning into a black basketball player.
she... was...
I/m typing as a gay basketball player from the sixties.
I like short shorts.
They are revealing, but it's comfortable.
It helps me jump.
There was no fog on the lake.
Swann Valley, sheriff's department.
Deputy Arbus speaking.
Arbus, the writer fella told me to go do a bunch of errands for him... well, he's not back here at his motel.
If you see him, tell him I'll wait another thirty minutes...
- and that's it...
I got to go.
- Alright, sheriff.
Why isn't the door locked, Arbus?
Yeah, I left it open for you, PJ.
What happened to your diet?
I was wondering when you were gonna get here with my hamburgers.
Feel like to playing some cards?
sure, but when are you gonna pay up?
- Hey PJ, get the chord there would you.
- Okay.
Don't ever walk into a morgue like that unannounced.
- My heart can't handle it.
- Sorry, I knocked.
Yeah, well, sheriff's over at your motel... and he said I'll only be here another thirty minutes.
Okay, thanks.
You owe me eighteen bucks, Arbus.
And Snooze, Ropopose, Sleep all...
Night all... and you didn't put this on your list.
But I liked it.
I thought it was good.
- Sleeping All.
- Just what I needed.
Are we gonna work on this together?
That is, what you said.
These are just goanna put you to sleep.
A chance to dream.
- But you didn't read the label's.
- Yes I did.
This is how you write?
I thought that all city writers... just got sauced and then wrote in some kind of trance.
We do... we do but...
There is a bulletproof ending out there and I know just the guy to get me there...
Hey do you know a doctor in town that can give me prescription for a real... real one?
I can't do that.
I'm a public official.
Twilight Lights.
By Bobby LaGrange.
Her skin was as fresh as cream, floating up from butter... under the lace negligee she liked to tease me with.
What keeps bringing you back here?
I'm trying to solve a mystery.
I'm waiting for you, my friend.
Here, by her tomb.
- After you.
- Thank you.
And you are...
Edgar Allan Poe, so... if you...
How can I help?
well...
I don't have no ending.
Did you know the deacons once corresponded with me... concerning the technique of writing the ending first, and working backwards.
What did you need?
Length?
40 to 50 lines... per page.
200 page minimum.
- Providence?
- Beauty.
- The tone?
- They'll tell you.
These points being settled...
- shall we consider the reframe?
- I like it.
The bell tower is becoming to me.
A reframe must be brief.
In my own work, my most famous... it's lead me at once to a single word is the best, I'm afraid.
Never more.
The difficulty arose from the presumption that the word... must be monopolously be spoken by a human being.
then immediately arose the idea of a, a non reasoning creature capable of speech... and, then very naturally a parrot suggested itself.
But it was superseded forthwith immediately by a raven as equally... capable of speech, but as a bird of ill omen... infinitely more in keeping within intent to turn.
Is all this worth the price of that very good bottle of Irish whisky?
Yes, of course, please continue...
So, I asked myself... of all the melancholy topics... what according to the universal understanding of mankind is the most tragic?
Death.
And when is this most tragic of melancholy topics... most poetical?
When it most loosely alludes itself... to beauty.
The death therefore, of a beautiful girl ... is unquestionly the most poetical topic in the world.
Equally it is beyond there that the lips best suited for the topic are those of the man...
who loved her.
So...
I had to combine these two ideas... of the lover lamented his deceased mistress... and the raven' continuously using the word "Nevermore"
in a poem of about 100 lines.
And "nevermore" of conclusion of each dancer... in a poem of melancholy tone.
How do you uh, find the ending?
Your story is a tragedy.
It happened here at the old Chikering hotel where I once slept.
There were many children in the town.
Orphans some wares, the lost children.
And before long they were taking in to protection of pastor Alan Floyd.
He was a kindly man, loved his kids.
And everyone agreed that he took very good care of them.
He taught them cataclysm, and love of god and goodness.
And one night it happened.
One of his children was missing.
And that's when it came out.
Who isn't here?
Peter?
Where did... he didn't go across the lake.
Never ever go with the people across of the lake.
This is very important.
They are like, like, like... vermin.
Unclean, those, those fiends across the lake.
They are... the undead...
They are vampires.
He took care of them and fed them.
Anointed them with the juices of spoilage, and sinkfoil and wolfsbane.
Anointed them against evil.
- Turn your head.
- Thank you...
That's right.
There we go.
Make sure that you be nice and safe.
Someday you will wear...
nylon stockings.
Where the hell is he?
What are you doing with my mom's Ouija board?
- Have you ever seen one of these?
- What would you do with that?
Innovation is what made the detective story and Charlie Chan entertaining.
Bobby LaGrange...
is an innovative detective.
After you, sir.
That, ouija board.
We are in close proximity... to the deceased.
And the killer is probably still in the area.
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this in a morgue.
Dim the old lights...
Hello.
- Do we know you?
- Yes, it is.
You're doing that, I can feel you.
- No I'm not
- Shut up!
H...
I...
M.
Him.
It wants you
Okay, do we know you?
I... am... her.
I am.
Arbus, what was that?
Ask her, let go watch.
Who killed you?
B...
- Sheriff, you're doing that.
I can feel it.
- Am not.
Who killed you?
B...
The evil kids at the lake.
They are evil.
And that Flamingo kid, he's the one that infects them.
He's a vampire.
Is he?
'Yes'.
Come on, Arbus.
Keep your gun hidden.
- You must be thirsty?
- Exactly
- I'm looking for Flamingo.
- He is right back here.
When the sky is low and heavy, weighing as a lid... on the groaning spirit, falling prey to long boredom...
Educated... you know BAUDELAIRE.
I know life man.
And I know the dreams of BAUDELAIRE.
and he from the horizon, the entire circle embracing... a dark day for our poor, even sadder than the nights.
I was hoping you could help me find this missing girl.
She is 12 or 13.
There are a lot of girls here.
You know, people are saying what's going on up here is... evil.
Are you worried about that?
Look around you.
Does this look evil to you?
Look at that moon.
It is beautiful.
I have been worried... it has been 3 days since we've seen her...
She's just a little kid that I take care of, but I'm worried that something has happened to her.
Arbus.
Damn it.
You?
You're out off uniform?
And you're here on unofficial business.
What the hell are you doing here?
he said you were okay with it.
He gave me 20 bucks.
Mr. Collaborator.
I thought we were a team, all the way through this investigation.
Bobby LaGrange does not like to be tricked.
Nor does he like being made a fool out of.
The famous Flamingo ... my... my... my the lady killer.
Arbus, arrest this murderer.
He's like that... either coming or going.
Or he's already gone.
- Those are the real keys for the...
- These are them... .
- these are the official keys.
- Wow, that's amazing.
- This is to the clock tower?
- Yes, really?
Hey give me, give me that.
Where are you going with that?
- Come on, just to see.
- What?
You don't want to go up there.
That's odd, I was up here yesterday... and I didn't have a hard time with this lock at all.
Yesterday?
Uh, maybe it was last week.
- It worked?
- Maybe it was the week before last.
Let me try.
- Here.
- Thanks.
What the hell was that?
You tell me you ever notice anything like that when you were up here?
You're not going up there.
This place is haunted.
Didn't you know that?
- What's that smell?
- The devil.
The devil lives up there.
You're gonna get it all over yourself.
I'm going out.
Goodbye.
come with us daddy...
come with us daddy
Help me, daddy...
Come with us daddy.
Help me...
Help me... daddy
- listen,
- What is that?
Are they evil?
No.
No.
tell me who killed her?
... tell me.
You say that you want to know...
but do you?
- I want to know the truth.
- There are consequences.
What choice do I have?
- Tell me all of the story.
- As you wish, my friend.
There happened events just make you ashamed to remember.
- Please.
- Thank you, it's a sharp of knife.
I wanna know what the secret ingredient is.
We're going to have special lemonade for everybody.
That's right... good job.
- This stuff stinks.
- Careful.
You cut your finger.
- Here you go, Alice.
-Thank you.
You're welcome.
There you go.
Don't drink the lemonade, he put something in it.
- No, stop.
- No I would like `lemonade, Virginia
Virginia, fine.
Enough, ... stand still.
Virginia, is being very...
very sick.
And we're all going to have some lemonade, it's delicious and sweet... taste it.
- Stay... stay... stay here.
- What are you doing?
Then he made a fateful decision.
Rather than have his children's souls be damned as vampires he drugged their lemonade, and slit their throats.
Can you make him stop?
Do something...
Death of beauty.
One child tried to save herself.
Virginia?
You're playing our favorite game, huh?
I'll find you.
Got you.
Virginia.
Virginia.
One way to God.
One, one, one way to God.
I got you.
Once the monster caught her he put her in chains in the vault.
No.
You must stop screaming.
I told you...
God wants you to meet mom.
That's right. scream all what you want,
Even God can't hear you now.
One road, one way to God...
One road, one way to God...
All in Jesus name.
During the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty...
I loved her... not as the living and breathing Virginia... but as the Virginia of the dream.
You see... dear friend... she was my young cousin... my beloved wife.
her name was Virginia.
but I gave her many names.
Lenor...
Bernice.
The lady Gaia.
Madenasha.
Annabelle Lee.
Alianora.
I assume that I am your partner?
...
Open the door, wake up.
Wake up.
- Open the door, Hall.
- Alright, alright... hang on.
- Wait 'til you see this.
- What?
I subscribed to "Writers Weekly."
and this just in... says that you took a 10,000 dollar advance on a project called "The Vampire Executions."
No, no... that was money for some old writes.
And that money already went to my wife.
that's a mistake.
But I was thinking, I do like "The Vampire Executions"... by Hall Baltimore and Bobby LaGrange.
give me my $5,000 dollar now.
There's not gonna be any money exchanged until we get to the story right?
- We gotta get to the end.
- The end?
The end?
It's a who done it.
Like every other murder mystery.
- Just let me wake up.
- It comes to who did it.
- Okay.
- What's the matter with you?
- You're foregoing your greatest asset.
- Yeah... what's that?
Bobby LaGrange, the detective...
You gotta take Bobby LaGrange and use him much more throughout the entire story... because he could solve the crime himself... clearly it's the work of a serial killer.
Someone wants to silence the girls, on the other side of the lake.
because, they fried a sick mind.
And then they sizzle them, because of some psyco hocus pocus condition... that condemns them to being the evil sluts that they are.
And that is what's in a sick mind.
You think so, Bobby?
You think they're uh, they're evil sluts?
- whom?
- The young girls.
Shit yes, they're all into dark things... every one of them they worship death...
and sex.
What do you think?
Oh no you don't...
No, not Bobby LaGrange...
them.
Those devil worshiping whores on the other side of the loch.
Shit Yes, they are all in dark thing, every one of them.
They worship death and sex.
They were just too saucy for their own good.
You know, they have that white flash with the devil inside them.
That little spice you can't stop, thinking about.
- It's not me.
- It's not me.
- It's them.
- It's the... flash of the devil.
I saved their souls
You... you don't touch me.
Do not touch me. tearing it out.
- Old, old bastard.
- Forgive me... forgive me for seeking pleasure outside of the company... cast me another way for my spirit.
perhaps, it takes the dirt to be boiled, only here alone?
With all of these things together, thrown...
- will burn it...
- Flame-proof, bullet-proof.
I can't even look at the cliff, without trembling.
This little cliff?
Wait, wait.
Do you dare to go further?
What are you talking about, tell me the ending.
If you don't stop now, every word ... that flows from your pen will be your your own tale.
You.
You are the ending you seek.
How can I stop now when it's so close to the end?
Then it's time to face the truth.
To end this story, there is no other way.
I am so ashamed, I should cry That's my little girl.
That's my daughter.
She wanted me to go with her friends.
I thought they were little boats... .
I thought they were children's boats.
I didn't know they were speedboats.
I couldn't guide them.
I was too drunk to wake up that morning.
I was with a woman.
I am so ashamed.
I could have gone, I set the clock, but it was the wrong time So the alarm didn't go off.
I could have been there... but been there, maybe still...
I'm so ashamed... so ashamed.
Than maybe if I would have been there she would...
I could have been there, I should have been there.
This little girl.
We share this little ghost, my friend.
Our work must be the grave that we prepare for it's lovely tenant.
Oh God...
Help me... help me, Daddy...
'Bullet Proof'.
You delivered the goods here.
I'm telling you, meat on the bone.
- You think so, Sam?
- I do.
Hall Baltimore, master of witchcraft, no more.
Never more.
There was once upon a time a town, not far from a big city.
A road ran through, but there were only a few businesses.
A coffee shop, a hardware store, a sheriff's office.
And all kinds of people..
vagrants, runaway teens... religious fanatics, retired seniors who ... well, it was a town of those who want to be left alone... and so they were.
Sheriff, Bobby LaGrange, had been there for years... also made wood novelties.
But the most astonishing thing about the town was ... an old belfry, that had a clock tower with seven faces.
You could see the time from anywhere in the town of Swann Valley.
the faces persistently told different times.
No question, something evil was abiding there.
Perhaps it was because of the terrible murder that happened years before.
Too terrible to talk about.
But which haunted the town.
Or perhaps it was those teenagers who gathered across the lake.
Some people thought they did bad things.
Worshiped Satan.
The way they dressed, the music they played... and their mysterious leader known only as Flamingo.
A seducer of innocent youth... and some said...far worse.
It was at this certain time...
that a third string writer... of popular fiction, Hall Baltimore ... drove into Swann Valley.
On his book signing tour... of another of his series of novels ... about witchcraft.
Excuse me, do you know where the bookstore is?
There's no bookstore around here.
- Great.
Have you ever read a Hall Baltimore thriller?
No, thanks.
Have you ever read Hall Baltimore thriller?
No...
Who is Hall Baltimore?
I am he.
- Oh.
Nice to meet you.
and you are ...
- Stacey.
Oh excuse me, sorry.
- Hi Stacey. bye Stacey.
Hey.
- Hey.
You sell weapons?
Uh, no weapons, just ammunition.
- Pistols?
Ammunition?
- Yes.

Best witches.
Hall Baltimore.
How does it feel to be the bargain basement Stephen King?
Not too wonderful.
Well, you know, I uh, I write horror stories myself.
You don't say?
And you're the sheriff here in the town?
40 years.
You wouldn't uh, or Would you, mind reading some of my stuff?
I'd be much obliged.
You know We had a mass murder.
A while back.
A lot of folks think the town's haunted
Well, I'm, I'm uh, just wrapping it up here in the town... and then I'm gonna be on my way.
You a mystery writer and you're not interested in mass murder?
.
No.
you come with me right now... and take a look at the doozie I got in the morgue
You got a doozie in the morgue?
- Yes sir.
now?
- Yes, sir.
There's a story in it.
I know what this must look like ...
- It is like a wood...
Ow!
Jesus!
.
Let me ask you a question.
How long have you worked here?
- Well
You don't run a gurney with a dead person on over my foot!
Sorry, sheriff.
Is this a common occurrence in Swann Valley?
- Tt's happened before.
serial killing it appears to be leaves a calling card as a wooden stake.
I don't want to see her face.
- I don't blame you.
I mean, it's really a tragedy.
She's just a poor girl.
Arbus?
- Yeah?
Arbus!
Alright, alright.
- You're on the clock.
Do you know who she is?
- This girl?
We get all kind here vagrants, runaways..
worse, those kids out at the lake.
All kinds.
How'd you like to calobrate on a book about this?
You and me?
Are you gonna...
leave that stake in her like that?
Howdy.
I'd Like to fill my thermos full of coffee, please.
- Okay
Edgar Allan Poe slept in this town?
Sure did.
- At the old Chickering Hotel way back when.
Chickering Hotel...
Thanks.
- Have a good day.
With my respect sir.
I want to write something I do.
I want to write something for me.
something personal.
Does that make any sense?
I have to break the spell of this downward spiral.
There's only one way to do it and I'm trying to do it.
I'm not gonna write another witch book.
I told them that...and, and, and that's it, I'm gonna do something for me.
You've done it before
When you weren't drinking.
Before Vicky's accident.
I can't rush these things.
You can do this.
I...
I know what...
I know what you mean about you just have to do it one more time.
Just...
write the damn thing, then you can, then you can take the time and write what you really want to write.
I understand, I get it. you know I do.
Did you call Sam?
Did you tell him we need an advance?
Well I did and it was extremely humiliating.
And I'm not gonna write another witch story.
You're having a holiday?
- No Im...
and I'm stuck here
- Listen to me trying to put people off ... come up wiith magic numbers...
to make it all work out.
Pretend there's nothing wrong and put food on the table.
- Denise will you listen to me?
You can't, you can't speak to me like this... just grow up ...grow up!
People always ask me, "How do you know so much about witches?"... and I tell them, "'Cuz I married one."
Hey.
- Hello.
Where do you come from?
Just down the road.
You past me.
You looking at my teeth?
No I'm not, I just didn't know where you came from.
I am very self conscious about my buck teeth.
Show me.
Your teeth are fine.
It's those braces.
Anyway I hate them.
- No, they're fine.
You'll grow into them.
They call me Vampira, because of these teeth.
but you can call me V..
- V. that's nice.
What's your real name?
- Virginia.
Virginia.
You're about 13?
Yeah, I'm 12.
But I look older because I'm tall.
I know who you are.
You wrote those witch stories.
And you're here to sign books over at the hardware store.
I love your books.
Especially the part where Elizabeth says,
"Forsake me never, for I will entice you from my grave."
That's my favorite part.
Thanks, I like your look.
Oh ...yeah.
It's just the way I dress.
You scared of me yet?
- What?
Yes.
A little.
That clock it chimed midnight three times already.
Keeping track of time around here is pointless.
That's why I missed your book signing.
Well that old hotel is open.
Come on I'll buy you a soda...sweetie
I have a girl your age.
No, I don't think that a particularly good idea.
- Why not?
That's what I had to go to the hardware store and talk about.
My story.
Well tell it to me now.
- No, I can't.
Come on.
We're open.
Come in.
I...went for walk, I guess I got lost.
Hey what happened to that little girl?
- What little girl?
Is the restaurant open?
- Restaurant's always open.
What with that old clock tower and all those faces, you can get breakfast anytime.
Yes.
Well, Mr...
- Baltimore.
Damned clock.
That clock has never told the correct time.
Just you wait.
You're gonna be very surprised.
Bell's the important thing, and it's working beautifully.
Better than before.
- I'll just uh, have a beer.
Melvin is the belfry custodian, assigned to the big clock at church.
It's a hopeless job.
And a real burden.
That old mechanism's on it's last legs .
I go up there about every day, or most.
Those seven faces they look at me like I was the one who invented daylight savings time.
You know who came up with daylight savings time, don't you?
Hitler.
And, you know who supports it now?
Doctors.
And you know why?
Golf.
They want more time to golf.
That's what it's all about.
You can't change time.
Time changes you.
Don't you agree?
What's your position on daylight savings time?
I've never really thought about it.
- What have you been thinking about?
That's the grave.
- Grave?
Oh you can walk on it.
Don't worry.
The whole floor is a grave.
It is?
- There are twelve children buried right down there.
13 children murdered in cold blood.
Well, actually he's right.
It is an even dozen, but one got away and she was damned.
When was that?
- Oh, a long Time ago.
The clock is fixed.
The clock is fixed.
Ha, the clock is fixed.
The clock is fixed.
Got you, devil.
She drew blood.
- Suck it out...suck it out, suck it out.
Goddamn her...
- Hey write it down.
What time did she bite you?
4 o'clock.
- It isn't 4 oclock.
The clock says four o'clock.
- You've got to be kidding me?
She's the devil.
It's the dead little kids.
You?
Why are you here?
what has she told you?
- Nothing.
What should she tell me?
Go away, old man...you know what you did.
Children...hurry.
The moon is going down...
time for nap.
Come on.
Come along now, come on.
my God, I'm lost.
Maybe this is what I need, ...this story.
Where are you going?
Help me.
You?
My god...
Edgar Poe.
show me the way.
Hall, wake up.
Are you, I know you're there.
Are you awake?
- What?
It wasn't me.
It's me.
This is your wife.
Hello?
Hall, wake up.
Are you, I know you're there.
What's the matter?
- Are you awake?
It's me.
What's the matter?
Everything okay?
This is your wife.
Yeah, I know who you are.
I didn't, well...
I need a second.
What's, oh my god.
What have you done?
Yeah?
That?
do you know how much it's worth?
- Yeah, I do.
160,000 dollars.
No, it's worth a lot more than that.
It's priceless.
you shouldn't even be touching it.
How did you get into my safe?
Just calm down.
please stop, just, just, whatever you're doing, just stop and put it down.
That's really not a joke..
you think it's.
I don't think it's funny.
It's a nice book though eh?
Yes, Whitman only had... there's only four of those in private hands okay.
Do you understand what that means?
Do you..
He set the type himself.
- Do you think I'm joking?
please.
- you know what...
I think you care more this old book than you do your own family.
You need the gloves for that.
- You Know what?
Get the advance or you can kiss it good bye.
Please.
- Don't make me have to do this.
I don't want to...
I have to.
Hello.
I'm looking for ...
- Mrs. LaGrange is sleeping.
Quiet.
Oh, sorry.
I'd like to know if you have any information on the old Chickering Hotel?
I'll check the files.
Thank you
Swann Valley, sheriff's office please.
one moment.
Your number is 393 229 39 23 .
do you wish to be connected?
Yes.
Sheriff's office, we're closed.
Yes, hi, it's me, You remember me, the writer.
I'm here at the window.
I'm gonna go to the front door.
Alright.
We're closed.
- Can I talk to you?
Look sheriff says nothing happens as long as that thing is in here.
Oh, where's the sheriff?
- It's Sunday.
He's at the church.
It's a mystery, he's not very religious
Listen, listen, uh...what time did you say the country coroner was coming to take the stake out?
I didn't say nothing about nothing
Um, uh, somebody said it was this week...somebody said.
- But it wasn't me.
Can I, can I come in?
Okay but look you can't touch anything.
It's all evidence.
Don't touch anything, you got it?
It's my responsibility, and I don't want that guy yelling at me, I'm sick of it.
Hello.
- Yeah, can I talk to the sheriff?
Just a minute.
Bobby.
Telephone.
Yeah.
- Hey Sheriff, I got that writer fella from out of town here at the office.
He doesn't know it's Sunday?
Let me talk to him.
Hey Bobby, it's Hall Baltimore.
Yeah I couldn't get your story and the image of that poor dead girl out of my mind.
Really?
- Yes, I dreamt about it all night.
I'd like to write that book with you.
So, you're the sheriff and you make bat houses?
Yes, and that's a bird house.
Totally different. .
The bats and the birds know which is which.
Weell normally I write about witchcraft but ... what are vampires but witches that suck blood.
Entirely different.
We haven't really had one here.
There are no witches here, since as long as I can remember.
I could ask my sister.
She's older than Hades.
Welcome to my office.
Come on have a seat.
Imagine this.
Written by...
Hall Baltimore and Bobby LaGrange.
Sweet.
Or, Hall Baltimore with an idea by Bobby LaGrange.
What do you mean an idea by?
I got a hell of a lot more than an idea by.
I got a great character.
- Yeah, who?
Bobby LaGrange.
- Calm` down.
Tell me what you got.
Shoot.
I call it, The Vampire Executions... and that will sell.
Not bad.
Go on.
The girl, who is she?
is she just a runaway?
Or just some 12 or 13 year old girl ... that looks much older than she really is.
A Vagrant?
Homeless?
Why the wooden stake?
- Yeah, why?
What, did that kill her?
Or was it something that was added later?
As a calling card for the real killer?
You see, one end of it was worn smooth.
No fingerprints.
And then it was pressed into her...slowly.
Not jab, not stab.
Almost as if it was done by some kind of a machine.
A machine?
- Yeah.
That's why I call it The Vampire Executions.
I think she was killed by ...an electric chair ... for vampires.
An execution device, designed especially by and for vampires.
That's different...
I wonder what that would look like.
Well I thought of that.
I made a model.
Ready?
- Ready
How about that?
Watch this.
You love it?
How can I help you, Hall.
- Hey Sam ... remember you said if I come with a bulletproof idea, you'd give me an advance?
Another advance.
- Yeah, another, more.
A bulletproof idea comes with meat on the bone.
Not a lot of fog on the lake kind of crap, you know.
Yeah, well no one can mix metaphors quite like you Sam.
Here's the title, right...just listen The Vampire Executions.
vampires huh?
And the main character get this...
she's a little girl, a murdered girl.
Beautiful.
- Beautiful, yeah, but she's just a kid.
No, no, no, I meant it's beautiful that she gets murdered.
But it's gotta have a lot of story.
Not a lot of style bullshit.
So tell me, how does this execution bit play out?
I, I will find out.
I, I mean there's a great...great twist ending.
With heart.
With tons of heart, and I'll get you a complete outline in the morning.
But you gotta get me a check to Denise right away.
I'm not kidding around, in fact, in fact the bank wire transfer would be better.
Its an emergency
You know, you know, I'm thinking, it's not bulletproof.
But Hall Baltimore, master OF witchcraft doing a vampire story...
It's not bad.
- Not bad at all.
If it's got an ending.
- It's got an ending.
A bulletproof ending.
- Bulletproof
But Sam, you gotta tide my wife over okay?
This is why I'm doing it alright?
25 grand.
Okay, you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna wire Denise 10,000 dollars.
25.
That, that's great.
I really appreciate it.
As I said, I'm gonna wire Denise 10,000 dollars... but I need the outline in the morning or I'm gonna stop payment.
Sam?
- And no fog on the lake.
The night was ... humid.
The night was ... cloudy.
Fog.
A Mist ...a mist descends ... on the, on the lake Mini, Mini, Mini ...
Unwanipanuki.
The fog ... floated out like
Virginia's silent ... dream.
No, that sucks.
The fog on the lake, the fog on the ...
The fog on the lake ... just to torture Sam.
The scent floats out like ... tears.
On a whale's ass?
No.
The fog on the lake...the flake.
The straight edge razor.
The fog on the lake reminds me of my first wife.
It dissipated with time.
I'd lost my mind.
And now I have a lisp.
And now I'm suddenly turning into a black basketball player.
she ... was ...
I/m typing as a gay basketball player from the sixties.
I like short shorts.
They are revealing, but it's confortable.
It helps me jump.
There was no fog on the lake.
Swann Valley, sheriff's department.
Deputy Arbus speaking.
Arbus, the writer fella told me to go do a bunch of errands for him... well, he's not back here at his motel.
If you see him, tell him I'll wait another thirty minutes... and that's it...
I got to go.
- Alright, sheriff.
Why isn't the door locked, Arbus?
Yeah, I left it open for you, PJ.
what happened to your diet?
- I was wondering when you were gonna get here with my hamburgers.
Feel like to playing some cards?
sure, but when are you gonna pay up?
Hey PJ, get the chord there woould you.
- Okay. .
Don't ever walk into a morgue like that unannounced.
My heart can't handle it.
- Sorry, I knocked.
Yeah, well, sheriff's over at your motel ... and he said I'll only be here another thirty minutes.
Okay, thanks.
You owe me eighteen bucks, Arbus.
Snooze, Ropopose, Sleep all ...
Night all ... and you didn't put this on your list.
But I liked it.
I thought it was good.
Sleeping All.
- Just what I needed.
Are we gonna work on this together?
That is, what you said.
These are just goanna put you to sleep.
A chance to dream.
But you didn't read the labels.
- Yes I did.
This is how you write?
I thought that all city writers... just got sauced and then wrote in some kind of trance
- We do...we do but...
There is a bulletproof ending out there and I know just the guy to get me there ...
Hey do you know a doctor in town that can give me prescription for a real..real one?
I can't do that.
I'm a public official.

Her skin was as fresh as cream, floating up from butter ... under the lace negligee she liked to teasee me with.
What keeps bringing you back here?
I'm trying to solve a mystery.
I'm waiting for you, my friend.
Here, by her tomb.
After you.
- Thank you.
And you are...
Edgar Allan Poe, so..if you...
How can I help?
well...
I don't have no ending.
Did you know the deacons once corresponded with me ... concerning the technique ...
of writing the ending first.
And working backwards.
What did you need?
Length?
40 to 50 lines ... per page.
200 page minimum.
Providence?
- Beauty.
The tone?
- They'll tell you.
These points being settled... shall we consider the reframe?
- I like it.
The bell tower is becoming to me.
A reframe must be brief.
In my own work, my most famous... it's lead me at once to a single word is the best...
I'm afraid.
Never more.
The difficulty arose from the presumption that the word ... must be monopolously be spoken by a human being.
then immediately arose the idea of a, a non reasoning creature capable of speech ... and, then very naturally a parrot suggested itself.
But it was superceded forthwith immediately by a raven as equally ... capable of speech, but as a bird of ill omen ... infinitely more in keeping within intent to turn.
Is all this worth the price of that very good bottle of Irish whisky?
Yes, of course, please continue..
So, I asked myself ... of all the melancholy topics ... what according to the universal understanding of mankind is the most tragic?
Death.
And when is this most tragic of melancholy topics... most poetical?
When it most loosely alludes itself ... to beauty.
The death therefore, of a beautiful girl ..
is unquestionly the most poetical topic in the world.
Equally it is beyond there that the lips best suited for the topic are those of the man ...
who loved her.
So ...
I had to combine these two ideas ... of the lover lamented his deceased mistress ... and the raven' continuously using the word "Nevermore"
in a poem of about 100 lines.
And "nevermore" of conclusion of each dancer... in a poem of melancholy tone.
How do you uh, find the ending?
Your story is a tragedy.
It happened here at the old Chikering hotel where I once slept.
There were many children in the town.
Orphans some wares, the lost children.
And before long they were taking in to protection of pastor Alan Floyd.
He was a kindly man, loved his kids.
And everyone agreed that he took very good care of them.
He taught them cataclysm, and love of god and goodness.
And one night it happened.
One of his children was missing.
And that's when it came out.
Who isn't here?
Peter?
Where did... he didn't go across the lake.
Never ever go with the people across of the lake.
This is very important.
They are like, like, like...vermin.
Unclean, those, those fiends across the lake.
They are ... the undead..
They are vampires.
He took care of them and fed them.
Anointed them with the juices of spoilage, and sinkfoil and wolfsbane.
Anointed them against evil.
Turn your head.
- Thank you..
That's right.
There we go.
Make sure that you be nice and safe.
Someday you will wearing ... nylon stockings.
Where the hell is he?
- What are you doing with my mom's Ouija board?
Have you ever seen one of these?
- What would you do with that?
Innovation is what made the detective story and Charlie Chan entertaining.
Bobby LaGrange ...
is an innovative detective.
After you, sir.
That, ouija board.
We are in close proximity... to the deceased.
And the killer is probably still in the area.
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this in a morgue.
Dim the old lights..
Hello.
Do we know you?
- Yes, it is.
You're doing that, I can feel you.
No I'm not
- Shut up!
H..
I..
M.
Him.
It wants you
Okay, do we know you?
I... am ... her.
I am.
Arbus, what was that?
Ask her, let go watch.
Who killed you?
B...
Sheriff, you're doing that.
I can feel it.
- Am not.
Who killed you?
B...
The evil kids at the lake.
They are evil.
And that Flamingo kid, he's the one that infects them.
He's a vampire.
Is he?
'Yes'.
Come on, Arbus.
Keep your gun hidden.
You must be thirsty?
- Exactly
I'm looking for Flamingo.
- He is right back here.
When the sky is low and heavy, weighing as a lid ... on the groaning spirit, falling prey to long boredom...
Educated.. you know BAUDELAIRE.
I know life man.
And I know the dreams of BAUDELAIRE.
and he from the horizon, the entire circle embracing... a dark day for our poor, even sadder than the nights.
I was hoping you could help me find this missing girl.
She is 12 or 13.
There are a lot of girls here.
You know, people are saying what's going on up here is...evil.
Are you worried about that?
Look around you.
Does this look evil to you?
Look at that moon.
It is beautiful.
I have been worried ... it has been 3 days since we've seen her..
She's just a little kid that I take care of, but I'm worried that something has happened to her.
Arbus.
Damn it.
You?
You're out off uniform?
And you're here on unofficial business.
What the hell are you doing here?
he said you were okay with it.
He gave me 20 bucks.
Mr. Collaborator.
I thought we were a team, all the way through this investigation.
Bobby LaGrange does not like to be tricked.
Nor does he like being made a fool out of.
The famous Flamingo ..my..my..my the lady killer.
Arbus, arrest this murderer.
He's like that...either coming or going.
Or he's already gone.
Those are the real keys for the...
- These are them .... these are the official keys.
- Wow, that's amazing.
This is to the clock tower?
- Yes, really?
Hey give me, give me that.
Where are you going with that?
Come on, just to see.
- What?
You don't want to go up there.
That's odd, I was up here yesterday ... and I didn't have a hard time with this lock at all.
- Yesterday?
Uh, maybe it was last week.
It worked?
- Maybe it was the week before last.
Let me try.
Here.
- Thanks.
What the hell was that?
You tell me you ever notice anything like that when you were up here?
You're not going up there.
This place is haunted.
Didn't you know that?
What's that smell?
- The devil.
The devil lives up there.
You're gonna get it all over yourself.
I'm going out.
Goodbye.
come with us daddy...
come with us daddy
Help me, daddy...
Come with us daddy.
Help me...
Help me...daddy
listen,
- What is that?
Are they evil?
No.
No.
tell me who killed her?
...tell me.
You say that you want to know..
but do you?
I want to know the truth.
- There are consequences.
What choice do I have?
Tell me all of the story.
- As you wish, my friend.
There happened events just make you ashamed to remember.
Please.
- Thank you, it's a sharp of knife.
I wanna know what the secret ingredient is.
We're going to have special lemonade for everybody.
That's right...good job.
This stuff stinks.
- Careful.
You cut your finger.
Here you go, Alice.
-Thank you.
You're welcome.
There you go.
- Don't drink the lemonade, he put something in it.
No, stop.
- No I would like `lemonade, Virginia
Virginia, fine.
Enough, ..stand still.
Virginia, is being very...
very sick.
And we're all going to have some lemonade, it's delicious and sweet...taste it.
Stay...stay...stay here.
- What are you doing?
Then he made a fateful decision.
Rather than have his children's souls be damned as vampires he drugged their lemonade, and slit their throats.
Can you make him stop?
Do something..
Death of beauty.
One child tried to save herself.
Virginia?
You're playing our favorite game, huh?
I'll find you.
Got you.
Virginia.
Virginia.
One way to God.
One, one, one way to God.
I got you.
Once the monster caught her he put her in chains in the vault.
No.
You must stop screaming.
I told you...
God wants you to meet mom.
That's right. scream all what you want,
Even God can't hear you now.
One road, one way to God..
All in Jesus name.
During the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty...
I loved her..
not as the living and breathing Virginia ... but as the Virginia of the dream.
You see ... dear friend ... she was my young cousin ... my beloved wife.
her name was Virginia.
but I gave her many names.
Lenor
Bernice.
The lady Gaia.
Madenasha.
Annabelle Lee.
Alianora.
I assume that I am your partner?
...
Open the door, wake up.
Wake up.
Open the door, Hall.
- Alright, alright..hang on.
Wait 'til you see this.
- What?
I subscribed to "Writers Weekly."
and this just in... says that you took a 10,000 dollar advance on a project called "The Vampire Executions."
No, no.. that was money for some old writes.
And that money already went to my wife.
that's a mistake.
But I was thinking, I do like "The Vampire Executions"... by Hall Baltimore and Bobby LaGrange.
give me my $5,000 dollar now.
There's not gonna be any money exchanged until we get to the story right?
We gotta get to the end.
- The end?
The end?
It's a who done it.
Like every other murder mystery.
Just let me wake up.
- It comes to who did it.
Okay.
- What's the matter with you?
You're foregoing your greatest asset.
- Yeah..what's that?
Bobby LaGrange, the detective..
You gotta take Bobby LaGrange and use him much more throughout the entire story ... because he could solve the crime himself..
clearly it's the work of a serial killer.
Someone wants to silence the girls, on the other side of the lake.
because, they fried a sick mind.
And then they sizzle them, because of some psyco hocus pocus condition... that condemns them to being the evil sluts that they are.
And that is what's in a sick mind.
You think so, Bobby?
You think they're uh, they're evil sluts?
whom?
- The young girls.
Shit yes, they're all into dark things... every one of them they worship death...
and sex.
What do you think?
Oh no you don't...
No, not Bobby LaGrange...
them.
Those devil worshiping whores on the other side of the loch.
Shit Yes, they are all in dark thing every one of them.
They worship death and sex.
They were just too saucy for their own good.
You know, they have that white flash with the devil inside them.
That little spice you can't stop, thinking about.
It's not me.
- It's not me.
It's them.
- It's the... flash of the devil.
I saved their souls
You... you don't touch me.
Do not touch me. tearing it out.
Old, old bastard.
- Forgive me... forgive me for seeking pleasure outside of the company ... cast me another way for my spirit.
perhaps, it takes the dirt to be boiled, only here alone?
With all of these things together, thrown ... will burn it ...
- Flame-proof, bullet-proof.
I can't even look at the cliff, without trembling.
This little cliff?
Wait, wait.
Do you dare to go further?
- What are you talking about, tell me the ending.
If you don't stop now, every word ..
that flows from your pen will be your your own tale.
You.
You are the ending you seek.
How can I stop now when it's so close to the end?
Then it's time to face the truth.
To end this story, there is no other way.
I am so ashamed, I should cry That's my little girl.
That's my daughter.
She wanted me to go with her friends.
I thought they were little boats....
I thought they were childrens boats.
I didn't know they were speedboats.
I couldn't guide them.
I was too drunk to wake up that morning.
I was with a woman.
I am so ashamed.
I could have gone, I set the clock, but it was the wrong time So the alarm didn't go off.
I could have been there ...but been there, maybe still...
I'm so ashamed... so ashamed.
Than maybe if I would have been there she would...
I could have been there, I should have been there.
This little girl.
We share this little ghost, my friend.
Our work must be the grave that we prepare for it's lovely tenant.
Oh God ...
Help me...help me, Daddy..
'Bullet Proof'.
You delivered the goods here.
I'm telling you, meat on the bone.
You think so, Sam?
- I do.
Hall Baltimore, master of witchcraft, no more.
Never more.
The last one's going on.
King crab 2010.
Man:
I thought this day would never come.
[ Cheering ]
It was a long, hard season.
Man:
We're glad it's over.
Got a lot of quota left to catch.
Keith:
It's the final drive to the finish line.
Watch out!
Watch out!
Watch out!

Narrator:
After eight grueling weeks, the end of the 2010 king crab season draws near.
Neese:
A lot of eyes on me right now.
Hell and high water, we got to catch these crabs.
Narrator:
Plagued by the worst fishing in decades...
Keith:
I have never had a run of bad luck like this ever.
Narrator:
...and marked by epic battles.
Keith:
Everybody on this boat, who's the [Bleep] Captain?
!
Jake A.:
Go home!
We all hate you!
Narrator:
Every man is ready to stack out and head home.
Sig:
I mean, every season, he says he ain't coming back.
And the guy's always back.
Edgar:
Why am I here?
Narrator:
But, for the final push...
The Bering sea will deliver one last vicious test.
Johnathan:
We got a huge storm coming.
Nothing's come easy for us.
Big weather?
Narrator:
A 1,200-mile-wide arctic hurricane is plowing into the Bering sea.
By nightfall, the storm's leading edge will tear into the northern blue crab grounds, and in just 19 hours, it will cover the red crab grounds.
The first boat to feel the brunt of the storm...
The 108-foot Ramblin' Rose.
Neese:
It's our last string of the season.
We need 35,000 pounds.
We've got 33,000 on the boat right now.
We need 2,000 more pounds.
Narrator:
Greenhorn skipper Elliott Neese races to haul the final 40 blue crab pots before the weather shuts fishing down.
If not, it's, you know, 10 grand we don't get paid on.
Narrator:
After coming up 15,000 pounds short on his last offload...
Neese:
The tank's quite a bit smaller than I thought.
You know, pretty disappointing.
Narrator:
...the rookie skipper is not about to make the same mistake twice.
Neese:
Every skipper's on the chopping block.
If you don't go out there and perform, you're...
You know, there's 10 other guys in line to take your job.
Narrator:
In the fore peak...
The crew takes stock of the season on their first break in almost 20 hours.
I gave up a lot of stuff to come out here.
Right.
A lot of stuff, man...
Quit a job.
Neese:
There will be no sleep, and this boat's pointing South.
Ramblin' Rose versus the Bering sea.
Let's see who comes out on top.
Narrator:
The first pot is barely in the block when the weather picks up.
But the skipper drives on.
We've been going about 32 hours now.
We haven't eaten in 20 of those hours.
We don't know what his deal is up there, but he's real not cool.
I got to be sure that I have that 35,000 pounds.
That is a must.
21!
Narrator:
To secure his spot in the wheelhouse,
Elliott has been grinding the guys since they first left port.
Boat's rollin'.
Pots are flyin'.
Waves are coming over the rail.
This is what you call nautical.
Narrator:
On this final string, the beaten hands are still caught in the crossfire of their skipper's ambitions.
Think I'm on the verge of losing it.
I really might have to check into a looney bin when I get home.
Watch out!
Watch out!
Watch out!
Phew!
All right, guys.
Back to work.
Davis:
When the weather's acting up, it's harder to stand up.
You waste more energy just trying to walk around.
Narrator:
For the next five hours, the crew muscles through their final 36 pots.
Last pot of the season.
That's it.
Last pot.
Ramblin' Rose did a great job up here, and everybody's proud of what we did.
Narrator:
In the end, the rookie skipper got his 2,000 pounds and hauled his quota.
Neese:
I think this trip here has kind of...
I've proven myself to the owners.
It just shows them that, you know, hey, they made a good choice hiring me to run their boat.
Narrator:
But the cost of his success could be steep.
Man:
Let me ask you this...
Who's staying, who's not?
Hopefully, he'll find a better crew that he can grind, that can put up with this [Bleep]
'Cause this crew here, they're done.
Nobody [Bleep] put up with this [Bleep]
So wish him luck next year.
And the last time he's gonna see me on the fishing boat.
Narrator: 470 miles to the South, on the red crab grounds...
[ Seal gulls calling ]
Sig:
They say, a red sky in the morning, sailors take warning.
Narrator:
...is the Northwestern.
Got my whole day just to focus on when the bad weather's gonna come.
Mavar Jr.:
This is an omen, I think.
Mark my words, it's coming.
It's coming.
So, the weather's starting to pick up more and more here.
I need to leave tonight.
Narrator:
With the storm marching South and an offload in just 36 hours...
Sig:
I need some big numbers to get what we need and get in.
Narrator:
The men of the Northwestern have 60 more pots to haul, and then they're going home.
That'll get you home.
That'll get you home.
43!
Jake A.:
There's crab on the table, and we're all having a good time, 'cause we're making money.
And we're on our way home.
Narrator:
As the crew works to plug the tanks...
[ Telephone rings ]
Sig gets unexpected call.
Sig:
Hey, Matt.
What's up?
Narrator:
One that's long overdue.
Eight weeks ago, deckhand Matt Bradley had a drug relapse and missed crew call for the king season.
We can't take you back if it's gonna be like that, you know?
It's just the bottom line.
I can't... can't do it again.
That's just the way it is.
You want Edgar for a little bit while I got you on the line?
- Hey, send Edgar up real quick.
- Roger!
Narrator:
Edgar and Matt have been friends since they were 12 years old.
Sig:
All right, well, you know the deal.
That's non-negotiable.
Bradley:
I know, bro.
I know.
Narrator:
They share a struggle with addiction.
Hello?
Hey.
What's up, buddy?
I know how it goes...
Believe me.
All right, buddy.
All right.
Bye.
Bye.
[ Groans ]
Sounds like a typical addict who's coming off a relapse.
[ Chuckles ] That's pretty straightforward...
Guilt, shame, no dignity, remorse, lost.
That's what he sounds like...
lost.
Never gets better.
We're just getting worse.
Narrator: 150 miles northeast of Dutch Harbor, the Time Bandit is skirting the Southern edge of the storm.
Fourtner:
15-foot seas and building.
Starting to blow harder, and the waves are getting bigger.
So by tomorrow afternoon, it's gonna be probably 25-foot seas.
It's gonna be ugly.
Johnathan:
We're stacking out today, even though all's we needed was like a seven or eight average.
We're pulling 25's and stuff.
Narrator: 10 days ago, John landed on a mile-wide crab biomass.
Yeah!
[ Laughs ] We're on the mother lode.
Yeah, brother!
We worked our asses off to get where we're at right now, and now we're just reaping the benefits that are all along here.
No matter what it's blowing, I'm going home.
Narrator:
The challenge now?
Haul 25 final pots before the storm hits.
Beautiful!
[ Laughs ]
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, baby.
Yeah, baby!
Oh, yeah!
35 in that pot.
That's probably about 500 pounds of king crab.
[ Laughs ]
Yeah, this is a real good pot.
Looks like the crabs are a little bigger.
Crab forecast is looking good.
Back to the weather, though, we're in the Bering sea.
It can change in five minutes, too.
It could bright, sunny, and calm.
Tennison:
Ready for a break.
I'm gonna have a little vacation, regroup, come back for opies...
Hopefully.
I haven't asked Andy if I got a job yet.
Narrator:
On the Time Bandit, the boat owners have a unique way of inviting hands back.
We're gonna initiate him, so he's gonna be one of us.
Narrator:
As the newest guy on deck,
Justin Tennison, will find out the hard way.
[ Laughs ]
Narrator:
14 hours ago...
This could have been done to you while you're asleep.
Narrator:
While Justin was racked out, the boys prepped the last pot of the season with flour bombs.
Yeah, he deserves it.
Step up to the block, J.T.
Ready?
I'm ready.
All right.
It's all yours.
Yeah, let's piss off the big guy!
Narrator:
On most boats, throwing the final hook is an honor.
Johnathan:
This is gonna be a massacre.
Narrator:
But here, it's a liability.
[Bleep]
[ Laughs ]
"What the hell's that?
!" [ Laughs ]
[ Laughter ]
6'3".
Scott:
He's the biggest, strongest guy on the boat, but he sure is dumb as [Bleep] dumb as hell.
Tsh!
Tsh!
Tsh!
So it either means one of two things.
One...
I'm part of the team.
Or two...
They don't like me very much.
[ Laughs ]
We love you.
You graduated.
You're going opie fishing.
You're part of the team.
Narrator: 50 miles to the southeast, on the Northwestern...
Yeah!
King crab!
Sig:
Oh, yeah, baby!
Narrator:
The crew has one final string to haul before chaining the stack and steaming to Dutch.
These guys are following Matt.
Not very well.
That's what this crab does to you, though.
How many fishermen you know that are up here that...
Peterson:
Everyone.
[ Chuckling ] Yeah, pretty much.
Everyone.
A lot of fishermen have drug issues.
A lot of guys do it to cover pain.
That's part of the lie, too.
That's part of the addiction.
That was the way it was for me, too, in a lot of ways, you know?
You're suffering up here.
That's [Bleep]
Burned-out sailor fishermen, you know?
Narrator:
As the sun sets, the crew grinds through the final 39 pots of the season.
And for Edgar, these could be the last of a storied career.
Edgar:
My sights are set on being able to go home at night, and then that requires me, basically, to quit.
Am I gonna worry about these guys when I'm gone?
Yeah, of course I will.
You know, this is my home, and these guys are my family.
I hope he realizes that.
Ooh!
Boom!
Boom!
Boom!
Another pot!
Whoo!
Yeah!
Whoo!
Whoo!
I think we got to.
Whoo!
Whoo!
[ Laughs ] Why is it always the last day?
!
Every time!
Every single time!
That's our going-home ticket right there!
Last pot, coming up.
Spray me.
It's quite the sendoff.
[ Bang!
]
Holy...
That's an awesome last pot!
Whoo!
Yeah!
Narrator:
225 miles from Dutch Harbor and South of the storm...
Is the Wizard.
Keith:
The weather is coming.
I don't think it's gonna be too long.
At any moment, it's just gonna go boom, you know?
The wind's gonna pick up.
The seas are gonna become more violent.
First half of the season was nothing but misery.
The second half of this season has been nothing short of spectacular.
The number's been solid.
Narrator:
Earlier this season...
Full pots.
Narrator:
Captain Keith Colburn pulled out all the stops to turn his luck around.
Bug:
Works every time.
Narrator:
But with only 13 pots to go, his luck...
Keith:
No sign up there?
Narrator:
...has run out.
The current is starting to pull my bags down, and I'm in a real hurry to get the hell out of this area, and the last 13 pots are all down.
Narrator:
Strong currents can suck the buoys attached to the crab pots under water.
The rise in pressure can cause the bags to implode, leaving the pots and its bounty lost on the ocean floor forever.
Keith:
I have white bags for my trailer bag.
That's the only thing that's barely bobbing, and this is what I have to look for...
A white object in a lot of white birds.
Like looking for a needle in a hay stack now, which, you know...
You give up an hour of fishing, that could be $20,000 worth of crab you don't catch.
No, I saw the same thing.
I think that is it.
That is it, yep.
It's up there at 1:00.
The current's running right now.
It's screaming.
The trick is to throw in front of the bag.
If you throw behind the bag, you're not gonna get it.
Because it's not leading straight down.
It's leading just at a slight angle forward.
Oh, just right off the back side of it.
Ain't gonna get it.
Man:
Ooh, that's a nice shot.
Ooh.
[ Cheering ]
Oh, yeah.
Yeah!
Whoo!
Yeah!
We got a "crabalanche."
This is a great pot.
53!
Unh!
Narrator:
Off the bow, the next pot is falling prey to the currents.
All right, come on.
Here it goes.
Here it goes.
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.
That's going under.
The hook tore the bag open?
That means we're not gonna be getting this one.
$2,500 worth of crab.
Thing is, the pot's worth 1,000 bucks.
That's about $3,500 sitting on the bottom.
That may not be the only pot left here, because this next one's down, as well.
Well, last two pots were completely down.
That's it.
Now we've got three pots on the bottom.
Now I got $10,000 in gear and crab sitting on the bottom right here.
[ Sighs ] I think this next one's down, too.
Four down.
Four pots under water.
Doggone it.
It's official.
That's pot number five that's sitting down there, partying with Davy Jones right now.
That's like $15,000 worth of hardware and crabs sitting on the bottom right now.
That really sucks.
Narrator:
And with that, the Wizard's season from hell comes to an end.
Over eight grueling weeks, the boat hauled 249,000 pounds of king crab.
Even with the $15,000 hit, that's a $1.8 million bounty.
Each hand is going home with $44,000.
Narrator:
455 miles from Dutch Harbor in the heart of the storm...
Haist: 27 hours...
I've been up for 27.
Narrator:
...the Seabrooke is grinding through their final 40 blue crab pots.
I can't control my fate.
I work until he says.
Time to take a nap.
Narrator:
Their new greenhorn, Josh "Stroker" Graves, is feeling the pain.
In the wheelhouse...
Something ain't right.
Captain Scott Campbell, Jr.
Tends to the boats' other greenhorn.
And then all of a sudden, when I look right above the penis here, off to a little bit, just [Bleep] grabbing.
Junior's brother whip might not make it through this final push.
Like a pulled muscle?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I don't know.
But it's starting to hurt.
My urination's starting to burn.
It's just right in there.
Dude, maybe you got a kidney stone.
[Bleep] I don't want one of them.
[Bleep] hurts.
Junior has already burned through two greenhorns this season.
Down with two.
One to go. [ Chuckles ]
Take some ibuprofen.
See what happens.
Give it a little time.
Narrator:
At this rate, 'll burn through two more.
Campbell:
That got me a little concerned that, if I lose him for a little bit, then we're in tough shape.
It's a matter of him, you know, toughing through it.
If you want to be somebody in this industry, you got to stick and stay and make it pay.
Last string!
Last!
[ Groans ]
Yep.
Greenhorn curse.
[ Chuckles ]
They just don't seem to make it.
Very few.
I lose him, then I would have three guys and a horn...
And a horn that doesn't know anything and can't keep up.
I don't have any balance, nothing to hang onto.
So, I'm trying to...
It's hard to do.
If you make one mistake, you'll probably be dead.
Eight in that last one.
He's not gonna make it.
Narrator:
Only three pots into their final string...
And things are not getting any easier for the struggling greenhorns.
[ Vomiting ]
Hell hath no fury tonight.
Misery has a name, and it's called the Bering sea.
We're just not smart enough to go into town.
I think it's getting worse now.
That was the worst roll yet.
Pretty much driving full throttle.
I got to use all 1,300 horsepower just to keep this thing, you know, somewhat under control.
Oh, baby.
Oh, baby.
Oh, baby.
Oh, baby.
[Bleep]
Whoa, that was a big wave!
Narrator:
After enduring eight weeks of pain...
Last pot coming up.
That's it, boys.
We're out of here.
The last pot of the season.
Man:
I thought this day would never come.
Aaah!
And we're still making money!
Bouray:
It was a long, hard season.
Man:
We're glad it's over.
Narrator:
The most successful season of junior's career comes to an end.
I want to shut down myself...
Get undressed, cook a meal.
Campbell:
I didn't think we were gonna make it.
And, basically, it was the crew being able to, you know, sit there and take the abuse that I had to put them through to get the pounds aboard, because the fishing was not that good.
We were short-handed, and we had to, you know, just push through it.
Pretty proud of them.
Narrator:
But in the fore peak...
Welch:
Something ain't right.
Narrator: 130 miles northeast of Dutch Harbor, out of harm's way of the storm...
Okay.
Turn it up.
The Time Bandit boys conduct an experiment.
Come on, baby.
Oh, come on now.
Up, up and away.
[ Laughs ]
Sig, you won't know what hit you.
He'll think there's 30 aliens.
Man, that thing's moving fast.
With the test complete, it's time to execute the plan.
And I'm gonna disappear off the A.I.S. right now.
Narrator:
Step one... unplug the automatic identification system.
I just disappeared.
Yep, we're back to pirate stuff here.
We have no global positioning system.
We have to steer by the stars.
Narrator:
Step two...
Turn off the lights.
We are so in the dark.
Narrator:
And finally...
We're only three miles away, guys.
Narrator:
Deploy 40 Chinese lanterns upwind of the Northwestern.
Man:
It's like opening Christmas presents.
Johnathan:
All four corners of this pad have to be on fire, and then that's when it gets full maximum lift.
And let it go, 'cause we're gonna be going with the wind.
[ Indistinct talking over loudspeaker ]
Hey, watch out.
Here it goes.
Whoa!
That was freaking bad ass.
Okay, here's another one.
Yeah.
- Are they launching?
- Yeah.
Fourtner:
We have some unidentified flying objects in the Bering sea tonight.
Neal:
I would definitely wonder what the heck that is.
If I looked up, I saw that, I'd be like,
"is that a fire in the sky?"
What is that?
Looks like two flares, man.
Narrator:
One mile downwind...
Sig:
It's been a tough season.
I mean, it's been up and down, for sure.
The last little leg was a heck of a grind.
Narrator:
The Northwestern is steaming back to shore.
Sig:
We've got quite a load...
Around 280,000 pounds for over $2 million of crab.
What the hell are those lights there?
What the [Bleep] hell?
What is that?
What the [Bleep] is that?
Is that a boat coming here?
What is that?
Hey, was there a boat behind us?
What is that?
What the hell is that?
Is it a chopper?
Looks like a UFO.
Bunch of damn lights up in the sky.
Johnathan:
Did you see their UFO's?
Is that Johnathan?
Johnathan:
Yeah!
Andy:
Look at those monsters.
Yeah!
You just scared the crap out of me.
[ Laughter ]
Sig:
At first I thought it was something in the sky.
I thought it was a chopper that went right over us.
[ Laughter ]
I can't make heads or tails.
Then I don't see any lights.
And I'm like, "what the hell?"
I was pissed.
It was scary over here, too.
And I was looking at those lights, going,
"if I'd seen all those lights in the sky,
I wouldn't what to think."
I wouldn't even tell nobody.
'Cause they wouldn't believe me.
[ Laughs ]
[ Men cheering ]
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
That was good.
I mean, you got me.
You got me.
You got me good.
Okay, man.
We'll see you in town, buddy.
[ Laughs ]
Oh, man, I love Sig.
Narrator:
At the season's end, the Seabrooke earns bragging rights with the biggest haul.
Narrator:
In the heart of the Alaskan red crab grounds...
The storm hits and unleashes its fury.
In the safe haven of Dutch Harbor, the battered warriors of the crab fleets lick their wounds...
I'll deal with my aches and pains first of all.
I got some ointment to rub on my shoulders.
Narrator:
...and collect their bounty.
Pop the hatch, gonna get rid of these crab,
Park the boat, and fly home in two days.
It's a good feeling.
Narrator:
On the Kodiak...
I enjoyed fishing with you.
I really have.
This could be deckhand Eric Anderson's last paycheck pulled from the Bering sea.
I know that foot thing is very painful, and you did everything you could with that.
Eight days ago...
Anderson:
I can't do my [Bleep] job, all right?
Narrator:
A foot injury cut Eric's season short.
Wichrowski:
There's 20-plus years of hard crabbing going down the dock right there.
Narrator:
In a place where careers are built on pain and suffering...
Man.
Every man has a limited shelf life.
Eric's sacrifice for the men of the Kodiak helped land 279,000 pounds of reds worth $2.1 million.
Each hand is walking away with $30,000.
Narrator:
On the Ramblin' Rose, rookie skipper Elliott Neese comes in with his head held high.
Neese:
My first season running the boat, we caught a lot of crab.
We did what a lot of people didn't think could be done.
Narrator:
Elliott and his young crew hauled in 182,000 pounds of elusive blue king crab.
That's over $900,000 of Bering sea blue gold.
The deck share... 30 grand each.
Elliott's next challenge...
keeping his crew.
Neese:
Now it's time to start thinking about opies, and I kind of need to know who's coming back and who's not.
Find out.
Are you going, Cat?
Yeah, I'm going.
I'll be here.
James?
See how it goes.
Kato?
How about you, Faresa?
So, pretty much, I can count on all four of you coming back?
Narrator:
With cash in hand, perspectives can change.
On the Seabrooke...
Campbell:
I didn't think we were gonna make it.
It's been a battle...
I mean, an absolute battle.
A lot of greenhorn problems.
Narrator:
Junior struck out with two greenhorns before finally finding his man.
The big guy made it.
He finally made it.
Thank God.
The only guy to last a whole season.
I'm just tired and sore and ready to get off the boat.
But for the young skipper's brother...
So, what's the plan for me now?
Get you out of here.
Still feel the same?
Yeah.
Whipper leaves the boat with a possible hernia.
Campbell:
If he has to have surgery, there's no way he's gonna make it for opilio.
Narrator:
But his pain won't go unrewarded.
Over eight weeks, the boat hauled in 291,000 pounds of crab worth almost $2 million.
Each crew member will fly home with 45 grand.
On the Time Bandit...
Man:
43 right now.
The crew is getting $250...
Andy:
How long does it take to get hypothermia at 43 degrees?
Oh, about a minute.
Here we go.
[ Laughs ]
Narrator:
A bonus for anyone willing to dive for crab.
He's got one.
Yeah!
[ Laughter ]
The Hillstrand brothers scored 168,000 pounds of crab worth almost $1.2 million.
[ Laughter ]
Each deckhand is going home with $54,250.
It was worth the money.
That was awesome!
That was good.
The Cornelia Marie landed only 21,000 pounds of blue crab worth about 100 grand.
After paying for fuel and expenses, the deckhands... and the owners... got nothing.
Sig:
Call it the end of king crab season.
We'll get the last tank off here, get the pots on the beach.
Misery... pure and simple.
Narrator:
The Northwestern finishes with 282,000 pounds of crab worth $2.1 million.
Each man in the weary crew will walk with $56,000.
Edgar:
Now I'm getting nervous.
I still haven't, you know, talked to Sig about quitting.
I don't love this anymore.
There's several factors involved that have brought me to a decision.
This season, you know, working on deck...
Has shown me that I can't do it.
Well, we had this conversation before.
We did...
last year.
But it's a reality, so I'm telling you now,
I'm not gonna be here in January.
Most of it's family.
They need me at home.
So then you pull out the home card.
You know, I'm sorry, but after getting sober,
I kind of enjoy my life at home.
There's the other card you're gonna play.
All the years that we were doing this, and when you were screwed up...
Right?
We were screwed up.
So, I mean, I put my effort into it.
I've put mine...
I put 22 years into this on deck.
How many guy that you know of have been on deck for 22 years, honestly, working for a guy like you?
A guy like me?
What's that supposed to mean?
Nobody plans on fishing forever.
Nobody can fish forever.
Only Sig Hanson can.
You're gonna die in that chair one day.
I don't think I've ever run up without Edgar.
If is used to never come back it would be very difficult.
That'll be a difficult pill to swallow.
I guess I'll find out in January, won't I?
Oh, man.
You guys missed a great party last week.
- Say hello to your new foster family.
- You're one of five wives?
- Married to a dude named Clyde?
- Who's 65?
Would it be all right if my son Jonah came to visit?
Keep laughing.
I will slit your throat while you sleep.
- Shoplifting is out of hand.
- You have to stand up to him.
Tried that once with his father.
No, hold it like you wanna do something with it.
- Again?
- What was I supposed to do?
Shoot?
No touching the forbidden fruit until I'm knocked up.
Slept with someone.
Not Kash.
- This was like a booty call.
- Whatever.
Steve got a text from Candace.
Is he dating someone else?
Who the fuck is Candace?
We work together.
That's all.
- I'm home.
- Little brother!
Hey, you.
Mm.
Okay, but you gotta promise.
Okay, I promise.
I won't tell Fiona.
Now, whose house is this?
I'm not sure.
What the hell are we doing here?
Trying to find out if Steve's cheating.
What?
Tell me that's not a woman's car parked out front.
Fiona is a big girl.
Fiona takes care of everyone, but no one takes care of Fiona.
Is this about Candace?
Because Fiona knows about Candace.
She won't do anything.
Too proud.
So we have to.
You're a sweet kid, Debs.
Hey, bounce, come on
Bounce, come on Bounce, come on, bounce
Everybody, just bounce, come on
Bounce, come on Bounce, come on
Bounce, bounce
I've just got this feeling About to lose control
Did you purposefully order a Sex on the Beach so I'd say it to the gay bartender?
Maybe.
Maybe I was hoping you'd actually take me away so we could have sex on a beach.
I could barely get you overnight in a local hotel.
Well, that was then.
This is now.
I just feel like I haven't seen a lot of you lately.
You mean that you'd like to see more of me?
Yes.
I guess that's what I'm saying.
Usually by this time in a relationship guy starts just showing up for booty calls, or wants me to meet his mother.
Either way, I start looking for reasons to walk.
Well, my mom is in Michigan, so you don't have to worry.
I think that's the first time you've ever mentioned your family.
Really?
Not much to say.
I mean they live in Michigan.
The whole state?
No.
Near Detroit.
Uh, Dad used to work for GM, so I try to send back what I can to help.
Family business.
He builds them.
You steal them.
Come on, let's dance.
Come on.
Liam is officially asleep.
That was fast.
Yeah, well, three pages from Deb's Eat Pray Love and he's out.
If James Franco wasn't in the movie, I would've nodded off too.
You got any cash you can float me?
Florence and the Machine are playing the Chicago Theatre.
I wanna take Karen for her birthday.
Pricey gift.
Things getting serious?
Fuck off.
She's my best friend.
Okay?
You know I never spend that kind of cash on a girl anyway.
All right.
Well, I got a Hamilton.
It's yours.
Thanks, man.
One, two, three.
God bless Jonah, my sweet baby boy.
And God bless my husband, Clyde.
May those caring for him remind him to take his blood-pressure supplement and his glucosamine chondroitin supplement so that he can bend down to pick up our child.
God bless the other wives who are on their knees now asking you to bless me.
- Separated from her kid.
Gotta suck.
Hopefully, the visit with him tomorrow will cheer her up.
I'm kind of excited about it.
Having a full house.
Two kids.
Don't get too excited.
It's only temporary.
Temporary, Kevin.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Mm-hm.
Are you gonna put those in my ass?
I'm not even gonna feel it.
They're earplugs, babe.
And they're for her.
That would have sucked, trying to fish those out.
Hey.
Wakey, wakey, Jackie Chan.
Who the fuck are you?
I'm Frank.
Oh, my God.
Did we?
Oh, now, now.
Chins up.
Fuck off.
How'd you know it was me?
I was talking to my Promise Makers group and I want you to know that I understand that so much of your bad behavior is my responsibility.
If you leave a dog in the house alone for more than eight hours you can't get mad at him for peeing the rug, right?
I found this in an album in the basement.
I don't know.
Maybe we can try to capture more moments like these together.
Why is it that I feel like you can't get away from me fast enough?
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Because you're paranoid.
What happened to that computer class you were gonna take?
They canceled it.
Not enough people, I guess.
Liam's gonna be up.
I gotta get him fed and dressed and to the clinic for some shots.
Don't tell Jenny McCarthy.
Hey, Debs.
Steve.
Liam up yet?
Squawking a little.
So everything cool with, uh, you and Steve?
What?
Why?
No reason.
I'm just checking in.
Hi, baby bottoms.
Did you have sweet dreams?
I thought I was baby bottoms.
No, I said you have a baby bottom.
I swore I would never date a guy whose ass was smaller than mine.
But I seem to be breaking a lot of my own rules lately, don't I?
Don't I?
He's assuming that was rhetorical.
Hey, you wanna come by tonight after Liam's down?
V gave me a copy of Queen of Outer Space.
Zsa Zsa Gabor at her finest.
We could watch it.
And not watch it.
- I gotta go to work.
- Okay.
Mm.
Ahh.
Hey, Steve.
Debs, breakfast?
I'm good.
- Breakfast!
- Hey, can I get a ride to the library?
Motorcycle.
No can do.
- When did you get a motorcycle?
- Always had one.
I guess there's a lot I don't know about you.
Truth?
I'm in the CIA and this is all just a cover.
Any calls, Kate?
Yeah, actually, some A-hole was looking for you.
Left this number.
Hand me the phone, will you?
Your tab is bigger than my ass and you smell like kimchi and vomit.
Now, stop that.
Your ass looks great.
Like you in the sack, make it quick.
I wasn't quick.
I was just busy that day.
Hello.
Yes.
I have Frank Gallagher calling.
Hey, Frankie.
Got great news.
Who the fuck is this?
Your settlement is in.
Yeah.
Which one?
Yeah.
Come see me.
I'll give you the 411.
Hey, everybody, next round's on me.
Kev.
Veronica.
Didn't you just clean that yesterday?
Child Protective Services is bringing my baby, Jonah, for a visit.
Everything has to be just so.
You're so lucky you have a baby.
How old are you?
Ten and a quarter.
Two more years and you'll be old enough to start trying.
Does it hurt?
Sexual relations or childbirth?
Both.
Yes.
He's such a douche bag.
He's on this whole father-daughter purity-ball kick.
Fuck!
He wants me to take a vow of celibacy so we can rekindle our father-daughter relationship.
Maybe we could not talk about your father right now.
Not what you had in mind for dirty talk?
Not exactly, no.
Unh!
Fuck!
Oh, shit!
Shh!
Carl's right outside.
Shh!
- Oh, fuck!
Fuck!
- Fuck.
Oh, shit!
Oh!
- Shh!
Shit!
- Keep going!
Yes.
Shatterproof, my ass.
Wanna go to the planetarium tonight and get high?
I can't.
I'm busy.
- Doing what?
Danielle?
- Less you know, the better.
Are we still on for Friday night?
Yeah.
Can you give me a hint?
Yeah, but not gonna.
Aha.
Crucial Confrontations.
Haven't seen you here in a while.
Been kind of busy, Simon.
I got a signed first edition of Harry Potter.
Overrated.
Made a better movie than a book.
And now with all those kid actors grown up they're scarier looking than the villains.
Hey, can you help me on the computers?
What do you wanna do?
Dig up some dirt.
Name?
Steve.
Wilson?
Wilton?
You need to know what the name is before you can look it up.
Try "Wilton." In Lake Forest.
There are zero in Illinois, but there are 15 of them nationwide.
- Can you do it backwards?
- "Notliw"?
No, I mean, if I give you an address, can you work from there?
Hey, um, maybe sometime we could just casually hang out.
Fine.
Fine, yes.
We can casually hang out.
1055 North Ave.
Says the property owners are Lloyd and Candace Lishman.
Hello, Ms. D-Lish.
- Cool.
Then we can hang out sometime?
- We just did.
She opened an ING Direct savings account.
Hasn't kept any large bills in there for months.
Believe me, I've looked.
- You know where she is?
- No idea.
How much you need?
- Gotta buy concert tickets.
- Yikes.
Wish I had it.
Maybe you should take Mrs. Niedereiter up on her offer.
Well, that should do it, Mrs. Niedereiter.
There are a lot of dark corners around my house that could use some attention, Phillip.
- Thanks for the idea.
- You're not seriously gonna do it?
- Mommy.
- No.
But I could smash her birdhouse again.
Hey what do you think of Steve?
Ass is kind of small.
Not really my type.
You about to retreat and count your wounded?
No, just...
I just wanna know if I should trust him.
That's like asking if you should believe in God.
Just be yourself.
Okay.
Okay.
Here we go.
Hi.
Come in.
Jonah, baby!
Mama missed you so much.
Hi, baby.
Hi.
Good afternoon.
- I'm Kev.
Mm-hm.
This is my wife, Veronica.
Hello.
Good afternoon.
How you doing?
I'm Andréa Johnson from DCFS and I'm here to observe the home visit today.
So if everything go good, then baby Jonah may stay overnight.
Is your voice dressed up for Halloween?
Excuse me?
Think we don't know how to, ha-ha-ha, raise a child?
Come tell me I don't know how to be a mother?
Uh, you got it wrong, sister girl.
I'm here to see how Ethel mothers, not you.
What do you mean?
Oh, please.
Have a seat.
That girl is only 13 years old, but she's still got her parental rights.
I need to make sure the child can handle the child.
You feel me?
Mm-hm.
- Yeah.
I feel you.
Oh, baby Jonah.
Look at you.
You're hung like a little bear, aren't you?
Hey, Andrea?
- Andréa.
- Andréa.
You think we could apply to get baby Jonah as a foster kid too?
That's gonna be a crap load of paperwork but we do encourage keeping family members together.
Yay!
All right, then.
Uh, Eddie's just down in the basement.
He'll be right up.
And, of course, you will all get your shoes back when you go, so don't worry.
It'd be great if mine came back shined.
That would be great.
But at last came a knock
And I thought of the door With no lock to lock.
Robert Frost.
I was a poetry major in college.
- If you'll open your Bibles to Psalms...
- Oh, sweetie.
- 127 verses three to five.
- Okay.
Um...
"Children are a heritage of the Lord..."
You guys?
Okay.
Oh, sweetie.
Oh!
Oh, you are ripe.
Nothing a little Puerto Rican bath can't fix.
Honey.
Where were you last night?
I had to spend the night with the kids.
- They needed a little Frankie time.
- Oh.
You're such a good dad.
Ha-ha-ha.
Oh!
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
Sorry, folks, I had a little plumbing issue.
The house is not mine.
- Lou?
- Frankie boy.
How's it hanging?
Still from the left.
Where the hell are you?
Jesus, it's hard to take a piss with this thing on.
That's a lie.
It was the wiping that was tough.
This from the escalator thing at the mall?
No, no, no.
This is the train doors closing on your ankle.
- Right.
I haven't been the same since.
- Yeah.
All I need is your signature and Monica's, and the money is all yours.
With the exception of a third of it.
It goes to me.
Plus expenses.
Sounds fair.
Me.
And Monica.
Yay.
That was a hell of a warm-up.
Unfortunately, those aren't the originals.
You two will have to go down to the city legal offices and do it in person.
What?
I'm supposed to take off work to go do this?
Of course not, because, as you know this injury's prevented you from working, remember?
Oh, shit.
Hey, look at that.
Client just went into labor.
Is that gonna be a problem?
Getting Monica to sign?
No.
Why would it be a problem?
Well, if memory serves, she was a summa cum laude cunt.
Yeah, well, she was a lot of things.
You even know where she is?
- I have a phone number.
I'll make it happen.
- Uh-huh.
I hope so.
She's a joint claimant on this thing.
No Monica, no money.
Do me a favor.
Feed the dogs before you go?
Bag of dog food in my desk drawer.
Thanks, buddy.
Yeah.
Mm!
All right.
Come on.
Get off of her.
Hey, man.
It's Lip.
I'm calling you from a phone booth.
Just hit me back at whatever number comes up on your cell.
It's important.
Thanks for taking long enough to let me enjoy the scent of urine.
I didn't know phone booths existed anymore.
What's up?
Sounded urgent.
Yeah.
I was just wondering.
You, uh...?
- You think you can loan me a couple bills?
- I can pay you for a job.
- You got a driver's license?
- Few of them, yeah.
All right.
Meet me by the EL at 11.
Are you screwing my sister's boyfriend?
If you're selling cookies, that's a hell of an opening line.
Do come in.
Can I get you something?
Milk?
Soda?
A joint?
It's medicinal.
No, thank you, Mrs. Lishman.
How do you know Steve?
Who is Steve?
He's my sister's boyfriend.
How nice.
So he's not pushing it into you?
Hey, Mom, me and Chip are gonna swing by the hospital to see Dad so you can relax tonight.
- Oh!
- Okay?
- Thank you, Jimmy.
You take such good care of your Mama Bear.
Mwah!
- Oh!
Uh, this is, oh...
- Debbie.
Debbie Gallagher.
Nice to meet you.
Jimmy.
Jimmy is my youngest.
Top of his class at Michigan in med school.
He is going to be a cardiothoracic surgeon like his big brother and his daddy.
He has been taking such good care of me since his father went into the hospital.
A fender bender.
Broke his knee cap.
And you know, doctors make the worst patients.
Would you like to stay for dinner, sweetheart?
Oh, shit.
I liked her.
Hello?
Hello?
Shit!
Shit!
Shit, shit, shit!
Frank?
Frank, I certainly hope you're not pooping in there.
It's a closet.
Frank?
You didn't poop in there, did you?
- I was waiting to surprise you.
- Oh.
- Surprise!
- Aah!
You got me!
Oh, Frankie.
Hey, do me a favor.
Call this number and ask if Monica is there.
And if she is, tell her congratulations, she's won.
Who's Monica?
- Doesn't matter.
- What'd she win?
Uh, I don't know, whatever.
A lottery.
Something.
- Lottery?
- A prize.
A teddy bear.
What for?
Jesus, with the questions already.
Just call.
Say it's a teddy bear.
And a hundred bucks.
And she has to pick it up.
Just say that.
Well I hope this Monica whoever she is worked really hard for this prize.
- Sheils.
- I didn't get a teddy bear.
Sheil.
Shit.
Hey.
Come on.
She didn't really win a teddy bear.
But you wanna know what?
If I was giving away teddy bears you would be absolutely top of the list.
If you will do this for me I will dress up any way you want.
No safety word.
Is this Monica?
Well, hello.
This is Sheila from Market Promotions.
Can I ask you where you do all of your grocery shopping?
Well, yes.
That's right.
You've won.
First prize.
Congratulations.
It's $100.
- And a teddy bear.
- Yes.
- And...
What?
- Teddy bear.
- Teddy bear.
- And a teddy bear!
And a great big teddy bear.
Hello?
- What?
- Yeah.
- She's crying.
- Oh, fuck.
Yeah.
No, I've never won anything either.
No one cares.
- It's so great.
Yeah.
I'm thrilled.
- Zip it.
I'm thrilled for you.
Get to the fucking point.
Anyway, prizes will be given out at 3:00.
At the store.
Yes.
WGN's own Tom Skilling will be presenting.
What?
What?
She doesn't know Tom Skilling.
- I don't know Tom Skilling.
- He does the weather.
Tom Skilling does the weather on WGN.
Anyway, 3:00 on the dot.
- Jim Ramsey might be there too.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- He does weekend weather.
Okay.
- Hang up.
Congratulations.
See you there, Monica.
What did she say?
Is she coming?
How can you not know who two of Chicago's weathermen are?
What kind of person is this Monica?
Is she coming to get the fucking prize or not?
Yeah.
She...
Oh, she's going.
She's excited about that teddy bear.
You know, not sure I can prove it, but I think it's colder on the North Side.
Let me take you home, Debs.
I'm not supposed to take rides from strangers and it's clear that you are a stranger.
Oh, man.
Are you gonna tell Fiona?
Exactly what am I supposed to tell her?
That your name isn't Steve?
That you have a family in Chicago she's never met?
Or that your mom kisses you on the lips?
Which is really gross.
Life gets really complicated when you're an adult.
I mean, you can't possibly understand these things right now.
I understand that you lied to my sister.
Why?
Because I was raised by a pack of wolves.
Just like you were.
Only my wolves went to Harvard.
They have red wolves at Lincoln Park Zoo.
Maybe we could go check them out sometime.
Trying to distract me by asking me out on a date?
I do not wanna be a doctor.
I do not wanna be like the rest of my family.
What I want is Fiona.
I love her.
Love is fleeting, Jimmy.
What are your intentions?
You're distracting her, and I need her in the game for at least a few more years.
I can't have you breaking her heart or running off with her.
So if you're not serious about sticking around, back off now.
I bought her a house.
Is that serious enough?
You what?
Come on.
I'll show you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Yes!
Yes!
This was Mr. Harris' house.
They said he died of lung cancer, but we're pretty sure it was full-blown AIDS.
Oh, my God!
- Has Fiona seen it?
- No, she doesn't know about it yet.
I was gonna fix it up a bit and surprise her when the time is right.
Think we could build an aboveground walkway that connects the two houses?
What, like a Habitrail tube?
That would be awesome.
Are you gonna tell Fiona?
Don't know yet, Jimmy.
Saw a really cool pink vest at the mall.
Really?
And I could use a new rolling pin and flour sifter.
Sheila's teaching me how to bake.
Anything else?
Not for the moment.
So which room would be mine when I sleep over?
Not going out with that Gallagher degenerate tonight?
Good.
You deserve better.
I've been reading more about this purity-ball thing.
It says here you can rededicate yourself as a virgin.
Start over.
Isn't that nice?
I mean, you show up, you confess your transgressions and pledge yourself to be pure again in the eyes of the Lord.
I'll give you the damn car.
Really?
Fiona would be pissed if she knew you were into this shit with me.
Well, what she doesn't know won't hurt her, right?
All right.
Task at hand, you'll be driving the follow car.
Golden rule:
Always use a follow car.
- Hey, silver Mercedes.
- And a security camera at the intersection.
Why don't we head up to some asshole town like Lake Forest?
- Plenty of douche-mobiles.
- No.
- I was thinking...
- Listen.
No.
Two hundred bucks to follow me after I lift the car.
You get your concert tickets, I get my work done.
That's it.
Okay?
All right, man.
Shit.
Rule number two:
Always remember where you parked the follow car.
Fuck.
Monica.
Monica?
Deb.
Jimmy.
Fiona's next door with Liam.
That my shut-up gift?
Well, I like to think of it as a peace offering.
A peace offering implies a one-time thing.
This could take a while.
How long?
Until I'm sure that you're not still lying.
Okay.
I gotta get back up to Lake Forest.
They're releasing my dad.
I'm gonna take him home.
You know everything there is to know.
No more secrets.
I promise.
Sifter sifts and rolling pin rolls.
Nice when things do what they say they will.
- Jimmy.
- Steve.
- Is this your idea of a joke?
- No, ma'am.
Because you're scared of women with an opinion.
- No.
- Yeah?
Yeah?
Watch this, crinkle-dick.
Oh, yeah, I'll show you what's funny when I rip your fucking face off your fucking head!
- Bob.
Bob.
No.
No.
No.
- Out of the way, Monica.
- Get out of my way!
Out of the way, now.
Put the shovel down.
Let's just leave.
- Just go.
- I'm sorry.
Who lies about a teddy bear?
Wasting my fucking time!
Are you sure this is the right store?
- Yes!
- Did they specifically say this store?
Yes!
I told you.
Yes.
I wrote it down.
I wrote everything down.
Stop talking to me like I'm stupid.
Frank?
- Frank!
- What?
Frank!
Start the car!
What?
- Go, go, go!
- What the fuck, Frank?
- She saw me.
- What's going on?
Come on!
We gotta get out of here!
Go!
I'm gonna rip it off when I catch you!
- Can't this piece of shit go any faster?
- No!
Monica's batting for the other team.
- What?
- My wife's a lesbian.
Shit!
- No.
No.
No.
- Shut up, Frank.
No.
No.
Fuck off, lesbos!
Okay.
My advice to you would be to let Fiona live in her own relationship.
You can't do it for her.
There's things she should know.
Well, sometimes, sweetie, when people are in love they don't tell someone everything for a reason.
That's like lying.
No, sweetie, it's just...
It's a little editing.
Now, by sifting, see, we separate and aerate those flour particles to make them absorb liquids better.
Someone should sift my dad.
Ha, ha.
You Gallaghers.
You're all so funny.
- Frank!
This is bullshit!
- Lock the door!
Lock the door!
What is happening?
!
- It's okay.
- I thought we lost them.
Did you even have a plan back there?
I was going to charm her into signing once she was there.
How was I supposed to know she would show up with ghetto Godzilla in a Peterbilt?
I am seriously this close to punching you in the dick.
Get...
They're just girls.
Stop.
You talk to them.
I need the key to the back door.
That is not a sexual euphemism.
I need the fucking key.
What did you do with it?
I don't know.
I can't think when you yell!
I'm not!
What did you do with the key?
- You're still yelling.
- I need the key, Sheila!
Okay.
It's by the...
It's by the...
It's by the washing machine.
- It's not by the washing machine.
- It is.
- I put it by the washing machine.
- It's not by...
Mom.
It's Mom.
Debbie.
My sweet pea.
What the fuck are you looking at?
- I got nothing to do with it.
- Sit.
- I'm just the driver.
- Sit your ass down.
That was a nasty trick.
Even for you, Frank.
I had my heart set on that teddy bear.
Poor Monica.
Well, what about your kids?
Remember?
The six kids?
Youngest was only 2 months old before you ran off ended up with fucking Shrek here.
- You want me to step in?
- No.
I didn't leave you, Frank.
Yes, you did.
I didn't choose to leave my family.
You almost destroyed me.
When I turned up at Roberta's that night...
- ...
I was an emotional cripple.
- Emotional cripple.
- With not one ounce of self-respect.
- Bullshit.
- I'm gonna start crying.
- You drove me into the ground, Frank.
You robbed me of any sense of dignity I ever had and...
Where's the rest of the kids?
- They're out playing.
- They live down at Fiona's.
You mind putting some bags on?
Can you put some bags on your feet, please?
- Bags on my feet?
- Yeah, I need you to put bags on.
- Don't, don't, don't.
- Hell hath no fury like popcorn burned.
All right.
- Steve coming?
- Hope so.
Are you guys gonna make a baby while we watch Cosmos?
Because that's gonna make me throw up.
- Billions and billions of sperm.
- Ew!
- Can you please turn it on already?
- Yeah, hurry up, I gotta get back to work.
Cool.
Shaped our evolution...
Hey.
- And what our fate may be.
- Missed you, stranger.
- You too.
Get a room.
- Get your tickets?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
Glad I could help.
Glad you're glad.
Steve.
Boy.
This popcorn's burnt.
Our microwave sucks.
It doesn't mean I want you to buy us a new one.
Universes smaller than atoms.
- But it's also a story of our own planet...
- Debs?
...and the plants and animals...
- Honey, what happened?
- Dad have one too many again?
You just gotta ignore him when he's like that, Debs.
Why do you always blame Dad first?
Who else is there?
She's over at Sheila's.
- Who?
- Monica.
Exquisite interrelationships of the awesome machinery of nature.
- Who the hell is Monica?
- Our mother.
Shore of the cosmic ocean.
On this shore...
- Debs, did you s...?
- What do you care?
You'll be living with Steve in that house he bought next door.
Surprise.
Because the cosmos is also within us.
We're made of stars.
We are...
- I'm going to work.
- Ian, come on.
Wait.
Mommy.
Mommy.
I know.
Mommy.
What the fuck?
- I need to see you.
- Not a good time.
Who keeps hanging their fucking laundry on my pull-up bar?
I don't know where else to go.
I thought you were working today.
Linda's gonna have my ass.
I'm supposed to be there now.
I'll meet you there in 20.
- Aw, bullshit!
- Yes!
- You physically abused me.
- What?
When?
- That 4th of July.
- Oh, come on!
You hit me in the face with a tray of apple pandowdy.
And you hit me back.
Yeah, after you broke my nose and scratched my cornea.
Oh, yeah?
What about this?
Oh, come on!
You started that one!
And I'll finish it if you lay a finger on her.
- Roberta.
- "Bob." Only Moni calls me Roberta.
All right.
Well, Bob, perhaps we're just in the way here.
And we should make our exit and leave Monica for her apologies.
Apologies?
For walking out on this piece of shit?
No.
For walking out on them.
Oh, my God.
It's all right.
I'm not one of yours.
Just came to rubberneck.
Ian!
I did it!
Linda's pregnant!
Ian!
Finally knocked her up!
Where are you?
I did it!
It's over!
What the fuck?
You're all so big.
Thank you.
I missed you so much.
Why didn't you take us with you?
Because I knew you'd be fine with Fiona.
Fucking right, you keep your mouth shut.
You better keep it shut.
You hear me?
Put the candy back, Mickey.
Mm.
That's sweet.
I like them sweet.
But then, uh, so do you, huh?
Ha, ha.
Put it back.
Now.
Fuck.
- Kash, what are you doing?
- It's a fucking Snickers bar.
- Fuck!
- Holy shit!
- Jesus Chr...
- Okay.
- You okay?
- Fuck.
- Hey.
Hey.
Listen to me.
Look at me.
- You fucking suck!
I thought you were at work.
There was a shooting.
Mickey and Kash.
Holy shit.
Mickey shot Kash?
- Kash shot Mickey.
- What?
In the leg.
He's fine.
Just wanted to get out of there before the cops got there.
Huh.
What'd I miss with Mom?
Well, you know how Dad's a total fucking asshole?
Yeah.
Turns out he's the good one.
I can't believe you sucked me back in here for money.
I did no such thing!
But since you're in town, why don't you sign up for this little thing...
- ...and I'll cut you in.
- Fuck you, Frank!
Wait.
You brought her back here?
Oh, Ian.
Wait.
You knew where she was the whole time?
This little reunion was bound to happen sooner or later, anyway.
We were thinking about coming around to talk to you.
- No, no.
Not now.
- Yes, now!
Yes, now!
Moni and I wanna take Liam to live with us.
- What?
- Over my dead body!
How about Moni sign whatever the hell it is you need, we get Liam?
- Done.
- No fucking way!
You can't have Liam.
Why the hell not?
He's not even Frank's.
Fact is Liam is black.
All you white folks scooping up black babies like fashion accessories have a rude awakening coming.
No.
There will be a backlash if people don't stop underestimating the cultural importance of a black parent raising a black baby.
Liam needs me and he's coming with us.
No.
Out of the fucking question, Roberta.
Roberta and I wanna start a family of our own.
How about you finish this one first?
- Taking Liam?
- Yes!
- No.
Nobody's taking anyone anywhere.
- You don't get to abandon your kids and then show up one day to take your pick of the litter.
Oh, now, that's not fair.
Your mother's made mistakes, but she's here now.
- That's got to count for something.
- Shut up, Frank!
This isn't about you.
This is about you.
This is about what you didn't do.
It's about what I did.
And you know what?
I did a fucking great job.
Debbie is class president.
She's on the debate team going to nationals.
And Lip, he's top of his class.
He set the curve.
Ian was promoted in ROTC and he tested out of English.
And Carl made something blow up for his science fair.
And you know what?
They did it all, no thanks to you, because you weren't here.
And I appreciate that, Fiona, but I'm here now and Liam belongs with me.
- He doesn't even know who you are.
- I'm his mother!
You were my mother too!
I don't!
I don't know!
Maybe I'll never be able to make things right with you but there's still time with Liam.
And, Debbie and Carl I am so sorry if I hurt you.
Please.
I love you so much.
Please let me be your mommy again.
Please.
Oh!
You know what?
You're right.
You are their mother.
And you're here now, so I'm done.
I'm done with the school and the bills and the clinics.
I'm done.
They're all yours now, Mom.
Good luck.
It's okay.
Come here.
Show me the house?
Yeah.
Oh, man, you guys missed a great party last week.
Say hello to your new foster family, Ethel.
You're one of five wives?
Married to a dude named Clyde?
Who's 65 years old?
Would it be all right if my son Jonah came to visit?
Keep laughing, and I will slit your throat while you sleep.
Shoplifting is out of hand.
Did Mickey pay for that?
You have to stand up to him.
Tried that once with his father.
Now hold it like you want to do something with it.
Mickey?
Again?
What was I supposed to do, shoot him over a cup of soup?
No touching the forbidden fruit until I'm knocked up.
Slept with someone.
Not cash.
Guess this was like a booty call, huh?
Yes.
Steve got a text from Candace.
Is he dating someone else?
Who the fuck is Candace?
We work together.
That's all.
I'm home.
Little brother!
Hey, you.
Mmm.
d Think of all the luck you got d d Know that it's not for naught d d You were beaming once before d d But it's not like that anymore d d What is this downside d d That you speak of?
d d What is this feeling d d You're so sure of?
d d d
d Round up the friends you got d d Know that they're not for naught d d You were willing once before d d But it's not like that anymore d d What is this downside d d That you speak of?
d d What is this feeling d d You're so... d d Sure of?
d
Okay, but you got to promise.
Okay, I promise...
I won't tell Fiona.
Now, whose house is this?
I'm not sure.
What the hell are we doing here?
Trying to find out if Steve's cheating.
What?
Tell me that's not a woman's car parked out front.
Fiona's a big girl.
Fiona takes care of everyone, but no one takes care of Fiona.
Is this about Candace?
Because Fiona knows about Candace.
She wouldn't do anything;
too proud.
So we have to.
You're a sweet kid, Debs.
Did you purposefully order a "Sex on the Beach"
just so I'd say it to the gay bartender?
Maybe.
Maybe I was hoping you'd actually take me away someplace so we could have sex on a beach.
I could barely get you overnight in a local hotel.
Well, that was then;
this is now.
I just feel like I haven't seen a lot of you lately.
You-you mean that you'd like to see more of me?
Yes, I guess that's what I'm saying.
Usually by this time in a relationship, the guy starts just showing up for late-night booty calls or wants me to meet his mother.
Either way, I start looking for reasons to walk.
Well, my mom is in Michigan, so you don't have to worry.
I think that's the first time you've ever mentioned your family.
Really?
Not much to say.
I mean... they live in Michigan.
The whole state?
No, near Detroit.
Dad used to work for GM, so I try to send back what I can to help.
Family business...
he builds 'em, you steal 'em.
Come on, let's dance.
Come on.
Liam is officially asleep.
That was fast.
Yeah, well, three pages from Deb's Eat, Pray, Love and he's out.
And if James Franco wasn't in the movie,
I would've nodded off, too.
Have you got any cash you can float me?
Florence the Machine are playing down at the Chicago Theater.
I really want to take Karen for her birthday.
Pricey gift.
You think it's getting serious?
Fuck off.
She's my best friend.
Okay?
You know I'd never spend that kind of cash on a girl, anyway.
All right, well,
I got a Hamilton, and it's yours.
Thanks, man.
One, two, three.
God bless Jonah, my sweet baby boy.
And God bless my husband Clyde.
May those who are caring for him remind him to take his blood pressure supplement and his Glucosamine/Chondroitin supplement... so that he can bend down to pick up our child.
And God bless the other wives, who are probably on their knees right now asking you to bless me...
Separated from her kid?
That's got to suck.
Hopefully, the visit with him tomorrow will cheer her up.
I'm kind of excited about it.
Having a full house... two kids.
Don't get too excited.
It's only temporary.
Temporary, Kevin.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Are you gonna put those in my ass?
'Cause I'm not even gonna feel it.
They're earplugs, babe.
And they're for her.
Oh, good, 'cause that would've sucked, trying to fish those out.
Hey... hey...
Wakey, wakey, Jackie Chan.
Who the fuck are you?
I'm Frank.
Did we...?
Aw, now... now...
Chins up.
Fuck off.
How'd you know it was me?
I was talking to my Promisemakers group, and...
I want you to know that I understand that so much of your bad behavior is my responsibility.
If you leave a dog in the house alone for more than eight hours, you can't get mad at him for peeing the rug, right?
I found this...
in an album in the basement.
I don't know... maybe we can try to... capture more moments like these together.
Why is it that I feel like you can't get away from me fast enough?
Because you're paranoid!
Hey, whatever happened to that computer class you were gonna take?
They cancelled it.
Not enough people, I guess.
Liam's gonna be up in a second.
I got to get him fed and dressed and to the clinic for some shots.
Don't tell Jenny McCarthy.
Hey, Debs.
Steve.
Liam up yet?
Squawkin' a little.
So, everything cool with, uh, with you and Steve?
What?
Why?
No reason...
I'm just checking in.
Hi, baby bottoms!
Did you have sweet dreams?
I thought I was baby bottoms.
No.
I said you have a baby bottom.
Mm, I swore I would never date a guy whose ass was smaller than mine, but I seem to be breaking a lot of my own rules lately, don't I?
Don't I?
He's assuming that was rhetorical.
Hey, you want to come by tonight after Liam's down?
V gave me a copy of Queen of Outer Space.
Zsa Zsa Gabor at her finest.
We could watch it...
and not watch it.
I don't think
I can swing it.
I gotta go to work.
Okay.
Mm... ah.
Hey, Steve!
Debs, breakfast?
I'm good.
Breakfast!
Hey, Steve, can I get a ride to the library?
Motorcycle;
no can do.
When did you get motorcycle?
Always had one.
I guess there's a lot I don't know about you.
Truth?
I'm in the CIA, and this is all just a cover.
Any calls, Kate?
Yeah, actually, some A-hole was looking for you.
Left this number.
Hand me the phone, will ya?
Your tab is bigger than my ass, and you smell like kimchi and vomit.
Now, stop that.
Your ass looks great.
Like you in the sack, make it quick.
I wasn't quick, I was just busy that day.
Hello.
Yes.
I have Frank Gallagher calling.
Hey, Frankie.
Got great news.
Who-who... who the fuck is this?
Your settlement is in.
Yeah!
Which one?
Come see me, I'll give you the 411.
Hey, everybody!
Next round's on me!
Kev?
Veronica?
Didn't you just clean that yesterday?
Child Protective Services is bring my baby Jonah for a visit.
Everything has to be just so.
You're so lucky you have a baby.
How old are you?
Ten and a quarter.
Two more years, and you'll be old enough to start trying.
Does it hurt?
Sexual relations or childbirth?
Both.
Yes.
Oh, fuck!
He's such a douche bag.
He's on this whole father- daughter Purity Ball kick.
He wants me to take a vow of celibacy so we can rekindle our father-daughter relationship.
Maybe we could not...
talk about your father right now.
Not what you had in mind for dirty talk.
Oh!
Not exactly.
Oh, fuck!
Oh, shit!
- Oh, shh, Carl's right outside.
Shh.
- Oh, fuck!
Oh, fuck!
Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!
- Keep going!
Oh...!
Yes?
Shatterproof, my ass!
Want to go to the planetarium tonight and get high?
I can't.
I'm busy.
Doing what?
Danielle?
The less you know, the better.
Are we still on for Friday night?
Yeah.
Can you give me a hint?
Yeah, but...
I'm not gonna.
Aha.
Crucial Confrontations.
Haven't seen you here in a while.
Been kind of busy, Simon.
I got a signed first edition of Harry Potter.
Overrated.
Made a better movie than a book.
And now with all those kid actors grown up, they're scarier looking than the villains.
Hey, can you help me on the computers?
What do you want to do?
Dig up some dirt.
Name.
Steve...
W-W-Wilson?
Wilton?
You kind of need to know what the name is before you can look it up.
Try Wilton, in Lake Forest.
There are zero in Illinois, but there are 15 of them nationwide.
Can you do it backwards?
Notliw?
No.
I mean, if I give you an address, can you work from there?
Hey, um, maybe sometime we could just casually hang out.
Fine.
Fine, yes, we can casually hang out.
1055 North Ave.
It says the property owners are Lloyd and Candace Lishman.
Hello, Ms. D-lish.
Cool, then we can, uh, hang out sometime?
We just did.
She opened an ING Direct Savings account.
I haven't kept any large bills in there for months.
Believe me, I've looked.
Do you know where she is?
No idea.
How much you need?
I've got to buy concert tickets.
Yikes.
Wish I had it.
Maybe you should take Mrs. Niedereiter up on her offer.
Well, that should do it, Mrs. Niedereiter.
There are a lot of dark corners around my house that could use some attention, Phillip.
Thanks for the idea.
You're not seriously gonna do it?
Well, no, but...
I could smash her birdhouse again.
Hey... what do you think of Steve?
Ass is kind of small;
not really my type.
You about to retreat and count your wounded?
No.
Just... just want to know if I should trust him.
That's like asking if you should believe in God.
Just be yourself.
Okay.
Okay.
Here we go.
Hi.
Come in.
Jonah, baby!
Mama missed you so much!
Hi, baby.
Hi.
Good afternoon.
I'm Kev.
Mm-hmm.
This is my wife, Veronica.
Hello.
Good afternoon.
How you doing?
I'm Andrea Johnson from DCFS, and I'm here to observe the home visit today.
So if everything go good, then Baby Jonah may stay overnight.
Is your voice dressed up for Halloween?
Excuse me?
Think we don't know how to...
raise a child?
Come to tell me I don't know how to be a mother.
Uh, you got it wrong, sister girl.
I'm here to see how Ethel mothers, not you.
What do you mean?
Oh, please, have a seat.
That girl's only 13 years old, but she's still got her parental rights.
I need to make sure the child can handle a child, you feel me?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I feel you.
Mm.
Oh!
Baby Jonah!
Look at you!
You're hung like a little bear, aren't you?
Hey, Andrea?
An-dray-ah.
An-dray-ah.
You think we could apply to get Baby Jonah as a foster kid, too?
That's gonna be a crap-load of paperwork for me, but we do encourage keeping family members together.
Yay!
All right, then, uh, Eddie's just down in the basement.
He'll be right up.
And, of course, you will all get your shoes back when you go, so don't worry.
It'd be great if mine came back shined.
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho...!
That would be great!
Ah, but at last came a knock, and I thought of the door with no lock to lock.
Robert Frost...
I was a poetry major in college.
Oh, sweetie.
Okay, open your Bibles to Psalms 127,
Okay, uh...
verses three to five.
Okay.
You guys are all... okay.
Oh, sweetie...
Oh!
Oh, you are ripe!
Oh, nothing a little Puerto Rican bath can't fix.
Oh... honey.
Where were you last night?
I had to spend the night with the kids.
They needed a little Frankie time.
Oh.
You're such a good dad.
- Oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
- Sorry, folks.
Had a little plumbing issue.
The house's, not mine.
d I wish I were a Beatle d d I wish I were a Rolling Stone d
d I wish I'd always turn up, I wish I had nowhere to run d
d I wish I was somebody, I wish I was a great big star. d
Lou?
Frankie boy, how's it hanging?
Still from the left.
Where the hell are you?
Jesus, it's hard to take a piss with this thing on.
That's a lie.
It was the wiping that was tough.
This from the escalator thing at the mall?
No, no, no, this is the train doors closing on your ankle.
Right.
I haven't been the same since.
Yeah.
All I need is your signature and Monica's, and the money is all yours... with the exception of a third of it, that goes to me.
Plus expenses.
Sounds fair.
Me... and Monica.
Yay.
That was a hell of warm-up.
Unfortunately, those aren't the originals.
You two will have to go down to the city legal offices and do it in person.
What?
I'm supposed to take off work to go do this?
Of course not, because as you know, those injury's prevented you from working, remember?
Oh, shit.
Hey, look at that.
Client just went into labor.
Is that gonna be a problem, getting Monica to sign?
No.
Why-why would it be a problem?
If memory serves, she was a summa cum laude cunt.
Yeah, well, she was a lot of things.
You even know where she is?
I have a phone number.
I'll make it happen.
Uh-huh.
I hope so.
She's a joint claimant on this thing.
No Monica, no money.
Hey, do me a favor.
Will you feed the dogs before you go?
Bag of dog food in my desk drawer.
Thanks, buddy.
Uh...
Mmm!
All right, come on!
Get off of her!
Hey, man, it's, uh, it's Lip.
I'm calling you from a phone booth.
Just hit me back at whatever number comes up on your cell, all right?
It's important.
Hey, thanks for taking long enough to let me enjoy the scent of urine.
Yeah, I didn't even know that phone booths exist anymore.
What's up?
Sounded urgent.
Yeah, um, I was just wondering, do you think you can loan me a couple bills?
I can pay for a job.
You got a driver's license, right?
A few of 'em, yeah.
All right, meet me by the L at 11:00.
Are you screwing my sister's boyfriend?
If you're selling cookies, that's a hell of an opening line.
Do come in.
Can I get you something?
Milk?
Soda?
A joint?
It's medicinal.
No, thank you, Mrs. Lishman.
How do you know Steve?
Who is Steve?
He's my sister's boyfriend.
How nice.
So, he's not pushing it into you?
Hey, Mom, me and Chip are gonna swing by the hospital to see Dad, so you can relax now, okay?
Oh!
Thank you, Jimmy.
You take such good care of your mama bear.
Mmm!
Mmm!
Oh!
This is, uh...
Debbie.
Debbie Gallagher.
Nice to meet you...
Jimmy.
Jimmy is my youngest.
Top of his class at Michigan in med school.
He is going to be a cardio-thoracic surgeon like his big brother and his daddy.
And he has been taking such good care of me since his father went into the hospital.
A fender bender;
broke his kneecap.
And you know, doctors make the worst patients.
Oh, would you like to stay for dinner, sweetheart?
Oh shit!
I liked her.
Hello?
Hello?
Shit.
Shit.
Shit, shit, shit!
Frank?
Frank, I...
I certainly hope you're not pooping in there.
It's a closet.
Frank?
You didn't poop in there, did you?
I was waiting to surprise you.
Oh.
Surprise!
You got me!
Oh, Frankie.
Hey, do me a favor?
Call this number, and, and ask if Monica is there.
And if she is, tell her...
Congratulations!
She's won!
Who's Monica?
Doesn't matter.
What'd she win?
Uh...
I don't know.
Whatever.
Uh... a lottery, something.
A lottery?
A prize.
A teddy bear.
What for?
Jesus, with the questions already!
Just call, say..
It's a teddy bear.
And a hundred bucks.
And she has to pick it up.
Just say that.
Well...
I hope this Monica, whoever she is, worked really hard for that prize.
Sheils...
I didn't get a teddy bear!
Sheils...
Shit.
Hey.
Come on.
She didn't really win a teddy bear.
But you want to know what?
If I was giving away teddy bears, you would be absolutely top of the list.
If you will do this for me,
I will dress up any way you want, no safety word.
Is this Monica?
Well, hello.
This is Sheila, from Market Promotions.
Can I ask you where you do all of yr grocery shopping?
Well, yes, that's right!
You've won!
First prize!
Congratulations!
It's $100.
Yes.
And, um...
What?
Teddy bear.
Teddy bear.
And, and a teddy bear.
And a great big teddy bear.
Hello?
Yeah...
She's crying.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, yeah, no, I've never won anything either.
Aw...
It's so great.
Yeah.
I'm thrilled.
I'm thrilled for you.
Get to the fucking point.
Anyway, prizes will be given out at 3:00.
At the store.
Yes.
WGN's own Tom Skilling will be presenting.
She doesn't know who Tom Skilling is.
I don't know who fucking Tom...
He does the weather.
Tom Skilling, he does the weather on WGN.
Anyway, 3:00 on the dot.
Jim Ramsey might be there, too.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
He does weekend weather.
Okay... okay...
Congratulations!
See you there, Monica!
What did she say?
Is she, is she, is she coming?
How can you not know who two of Chicago's weathermen are?
What kind of person is this Monica?
Is she coming to get the fucking prize or not?
Yeah.
She...
oh, she's going.
She's... she's excited about that teddy bear.
You know, not sure I can prove it, but...
I think it's colder on the North Side.
Let me take you home, Debs.
I'm not supposed to take rides from strangers.
And it's clear that you are a stranger.
Oh, man.
Are you gonna tell Fiona?
Exactly what am I supposed to tell her?
That your name isn't Steve?
That you have a family in Chicago she's never met?
Or that your mom kisses you on the lips?
Which is really gross, by the way.
Life gets really complicated when you're an adult.
I mean, you can't possibly understand these things right now.
I understand that you lied to my sister.
Why?
Because I was raised by a pack of wolves.
Just like you were.
Only my wolves went to Harvard.
You know they have Red Wolves at Lincoln Park Zoo.
Maybe we could go check them out sometime.
Trying to distract me by asking me out on a date?
I do not want to be a doctor.
I do not want to be like the rest of my family.
What I want is Fiona.
I love her!
Love is fleeting, Jimmy.
What are your intentions?
You're distracting her, and I need her in the game for at least a few more years.
I can't have you breaking her heart, or running off with her.
So if you're not serious about sticking around, back off now.
I bought her a house.
Is that serious enough?
You what?
Come on.
I'll show you.
Really?
Yeah.
Yes!
Yes!
This was Mr. Harris's house.
They said he died of lung cancer, but we're all pretty sure it was full-blown AIDS.
Oh.
My.
God.
Has Fiona seen it?
No, she doesn't know about it yet.
I was going to, you know, fix it up a bit, and surprise her when the time is right.
Think we could build an above-ground walkway that connects the two houses?
What, like a Habitrail tube?
That would be awesome.
Are you going to tell Fiona?
Don't know yet, Jimmy.
Saw a really cool pink vest at the mall.
Really?
And I could use a new rolling pin and flour sifter.
Sheila's teaching me how to bake.
Anything else?
Not for the moment.
So... which room will be mine when I sleep over?
Not going out with that Gallagher degenerate tonight?
Good.
You deserve better.
I've been reading more about this Purity Ball thing.
It says here you can
"re-dedicate yourself as a virgin."
Start over.
Isn't that nice?
I mean, you show up, confess your transgressions, and pledge yourself to be pure again, in the eyes of the Lord.
I'll give you the damn car.
Really?
Fiona would be pissed if she knew you were into this shit with me.
Well, what she doesn't know won't hurt her, right?
All right.
Task at hand.
You'll be driving the follow car.
The golden rule:
always use a follow car.
Nice silver Mercedes.
Nice security camera at the intersection.
Wait, why don't we head up to some asshole town, like Lake Forest?
Plenty of douche-mobiles up there.
No.
No, I was just thinking that, you know...
Listen, no.
200 bucks to follow me after I lift the car, you get your concert tickets, I get my work done.
That's it.
Okay?
All right, man.
Shit.
Rule number two:
always remember where you park the follow car.
Fuck.
Monica.
Monica?
Deb.
Jimmy.
Fiona's next door with Liam.
That my "shut-up gift"?
Well, I like to think of it as a peace offering.
Peace offering implies a one-time thing.
This could take a while.
How long?
Till I'm sure that you're not still lying.
Okay.
I gotta get back up to Lake Forest.
They're releasing my dad from the hospital.
I'm gonna pick him up, I'm gonna take him home.
You know everything there is to know.
No more secrets.
I promise.
Sifter sifts, and rolling pin rolls.
Nice when things do what the say they will.
Jimmy.
Steve.
Is this your idea of a joke, huh?
'Cause you're scared of women with an opinion, yeah?
Yeah, watch this crinkle-dick.
I'll show you what's funny when I rip your fucking face off your fuckin' head!
Out of the way, Monica!
- Get out of the way now!
- Put the shovel down.
Please!
I'm sorry.
Who lies about a teddy bear?
Wasting my fucking time.
Are you sure this is even the right store?
Yes.
They specifically said this store?
Yes, I told you yes.
I wrote it down.
I wrote everything down.
Stop talking to me like I'm stupid.
Frank?
Frank!
What?
!
Frank!
Start the car!
What?
Go, go, go!
What the fuck, Frank?
She saw me.
What's going on?
Come on, we gotta get outta here!
Go!
I'm gonna rip it off when I catch you!
Can't this piece of shit go any faster?
!
No.
Monica's batting for the other team.
What?
!
My wife's a fucking lesbian!
Shit!
Hmph!
d You're gonna look over, you never know what you'll find... d
Go!
Go!
Shut up, Frank!
Go!
Go!
d But we'll stop, but we'll stop d d But we'll stop!
d
Fuck off, lesbos!
I would say my advice to you would be to let Fiona live in her own relationship.
You can't do it for her.
There's things you should know.
Well, sometimes, sweetie, when people are in love, they don't tell someone everything for a reason.
That's like lying.
No, sweetie, it's just...
it's a little editing.
Now the sifting.
See?
We separate and aerate those flour particles to make them absorb liquids better.
Someone should sift my dad.
Oh, you Gallaghers.
You're all so funny.
Frank!
This is bullshit, Frank!
Bar the door!
Lock the door!
What is happening?
!
It's okay, Sheila.
It's just my dad.
I thought we lost 'em.
Did you even have a plan back there?
I was going to charm her into signing once she was there.
How the hell was I supposed to know she would show up with ghetto Godzilla in a Peterbilt.
I am seriously this close to punching you in the dick.
Get...
They're just girls.
Stop.
You talk to them.
I need the key to the back door.
That is not a sexual euphemism.
I need the fucking key.
What did you do with it?
I-I-I don't know.
I can't think when you yell, Frank.
I'm not yelling.
What'd you do with the key?
You're still yelling.
I need the key, Sheila.
Okay, okay, it's by the...
it's by the... it's by the washing machine.
It's not by the washing machine.
Yes, it is.
I put it by the washing machine.
It's not by the...
Mom.
It-it's Mom.
Debbie.
Oh, my sweet pea.
What the fuck are you looking at?
!
Hey, look, I got nothing to do with it, all right?
I'm just the driver.
Sit.
Sit your ass down.
Oh...
That was a nasty trick.
Even for you, Frank.
I had my heart set on that teddy bear.
Oh, poor Monica.
Well, what about your kids?
!
Remember?
The six kids?
Youngest was only two months old before you ran off.
Ended up with...
fucking Shrek here.
You want me to step in here, Monica?
No, I didn't leave you, Frank.
Yes, you did.
I didn't choose to leave my family.
You almost destroyed me.
When I turned up at Roberta's that night,
- I was an...
- Emotional cripple!
Oh, bullshit.
With not one ounce of self-respect.
You almost destroyed me.
I'm gonna start crying.
You drove me into the ground, Frank.
You-you robbed me of any sense of dignity
I ever had, and...
Where's the rest of the kids?
They're out playing.
They live down at Fiona's.
You mind putting some bags on?
Can you... can you put some bags on your feet?
Bags on my feet?
- Take your shoes off.
- I need you to put bags on.
Don't, don't don't.
Hell hath no fury like popcorn burned.
Is Steve coming?
Hope so.
Are you guys going to make a baby while we watch Cosmos?
'Cause that's going to make me throw up.
Billions and billions of sperm.
Ew!
Steve, please turn it on already.
Yeah, hurry up.
I gotta get back to work.
Ooh!
Cool.
Hey.
And what our faith may be.
Missed you, stranger.
You, too.
Get a room.
- Get your tickets?
- Oh, yeah.
Thanks.
Glad I could help.
Glad you're glad.
Steve.
And birds...
Oh, this popcorn's burnt.
Our microwave sucks.
That doesn't mean I want you to buy us a new one.
The universe is smaller than atoms.
But it's also the story of our own planet.
Debs?
Honey, what happened?
What, Dad have one too many again?
You just got to ignore him when he's like that, Debs.
Why do you always blame Dad first?
Who else is there?
She's over at Sheila's.
Who?
Monica.
Relationships of the awesome machinery of nature.
Who the hell is Monica?
Her mother.
On this shore, we've learned...
Debs.
What do you care?
!
You'll be living with Steve in that house he bought next door!
Some part of our being knows...
Surprise.
Because the cosmos is also within us.
We're made of star stuff.
I'm going to work.
Ian, come on, wait.
Mommy!
Mommy!
I know.
Mommy!
Mommy!
Worlds of ice and stars of diamonds.
Atoms and masses...
What the fuck?
I need to see you.
- Not a good time.
- Who keeps hanging their fucking laundry on my pull-up bar?
!
I-I-I don't know where else to go.
I thought you were working today.
Uh, Linda's gonna have my ass.
I'm supposed to be there now.
I'll meet you there in 20.
Oh, bullshit!
You physically abused me.
What?
!
When?
!
The Fourth of July.
Oh, come on, you hit me in the face with a tray of apple pan dowdy.
And you hit me back.
Yeah, after you broke my nose and scratched my cornea.
Oh, yeah?
What about this?
Oh, come on, you started that one.
And I'll finish it if you lay a finger on her.
Roberta...
Bob.
Only Moni called me Roberta.
All right, well Bob, we're just in the way here and we should make our exit and leave Monica for her apologies.
Apologies?
For walking out on this piece of shit?
No, for walking out on them.
Oh, my God.
It's all right.
I'm not one of yours.
Just came to rubberneck.
Alhamdu lillah!
Ian, I did it.
Linda's pregnant.
Ian.
Finally knocked her up.
Where are you?
I did it.
It's over.
What the fuck?
!
Sign the name!
Sign the name!
You're all so big.
I missed you so much.
Well, why didn't you take us with you?
Because...
I knew you'd be fine with Fiona.
Fucking right you keep your mouth shut.
You better keep it shut.
You hear me?
Put the candy back, Mickey.
Mm.
That's sweet.
I like 'em sweet.
But then, uh... so do you, huh?
Huh?
Put it back.
Now.
Fuck!
Kash, what are you doing?
It's a fucking Snickers bar!
Fuck!
Holy shit!
Jesus Chr...!
You okay?
Fuck!
Hey, hey, listen to me.
You fuckin' suck!
Thought you were at work.
There was a shooting.
Mickey and Kash.
Holy shit, Mickey shot Kash?
Kash shot Mickey.
What?
In the leg.
He's fine.
I just wanted to get out of there before the cops got there.
What'd I miss with Mom?
Well, you know how Dad's a total fucking asshole?
Yeah.
Turns out he's the good one.
Oh, I can't believe you sucked me back in here for money!
I did no such thing.
But since you're in town, why don't you sign up for this little thing and I will cut you in...
Oh, fuck you, Frank!
Wait, you brought her back here?
Oh, Ian.
Wait, you knew where she was the whole time?
Okay, look, this little reunion was bound to happen sooner or later anyway.
We were thinking about coming around to talk to you about something else.
No, no...
Yes, now.
Yes, now.
Moni and I want to take Liam to live with us.
What?
!
Over my dead body.
How about Moni sign whatever the hell it is you need... we get Liam.
Done.
No fucking way!
You can't have Liam.
Why the hell not?
He's not even Frank's.
Fact is,
Liam is black.
All you white folks scooping up black babies like fashion accessories have a rude awakening coming.
There will be a backlash if people don't stop underestimating the cultural importance of a black parent raising a black baby.
Liam needs me and he's coming with us.
Out of the fucking question, Roberta.
Roberta and I want to start a family of our own.
Well, how about you finish this one first.
They're taking Liam?
No!
Yes!
No, nobody's taking anyone anywhere.
You don't get to abandon your kids and then show up one day to take your pick of the litter.
Oh, now that's not fair.
Your mother's made mistakes, but she's here now.
- That's got to count for something.
- Shut up, Frank!
This isn't about you.
This is about you.
This is about what you didn't do.
It's about what I did.
And you know what?
I did a fucking great job.
Debbie is class president.
She's on the debate team, going to nationals.
And Lip, he's top of his class.
He set the curve.
Ian was promoted in ROTC and he tested out of English.
And Carl made something blow up for his science fair.
And you know what, they did it all, no thanks to you!
Because you weren't here!
And I appreciate that, Fiona.
But I'm here now.
And Liam belongs with me.
He doesn't even know who you are.
I'm his mother!
You were my mother, too!
I don't!
I don't know!
Maybe I'll never be able to make things right with you... but there's still time with Liam.
And Debbie and Carl,
I am so sorry if I hurt you.
See, I love you so much.
Please let me be your mommy again.
Please?
You know what?
You're right.
You are their mother.
And you're here now.
So I'm done.
I'm done with the school and the bills and the clinics.
I'm done.
They're all yours now, Mom.
Good luck.
d Baby blue... d d This is not the sky... d
d That you know... d
Come here.
d You want to fly... d
Show me the house?
Yeah.
Oh, man, you guys missed a great party last week.
Say hello to your new foster family, Ethel.
You're one of five wives?
Married to a dude named Clyde?
Who's 65 years old?
Would it be all right if my son Jonah came to visit?
Keep laughing, and I will slit your throat while you sleep.
Shoplifting is out of hand.
Did Mickey pay for that?
You have to stand up to him.
Tried that once with his father.
Now hold it like you want to do something with it.
Mickey?
Again?
What was I supposed to do, shoot him over a cup of soup?
No touching the forbidden fruit until I'm knocked up.
Slept with someone.
Not cash.
Guess this was like a booty call, huh?
Yes.
Steve got a text from Candace.
Is he dating someone else?
Who the fuck is Candace?
We work together.
That's all.
I'm home.
Little brother!
Hey, you.
Mmm.

Okay, but you got to promise.
Okay, I promise...
I won't tell Fiona.
Now, whose house is this?
I'm not sure.
What the hell are we doing here?
Trying to find out if Steve's cheating.
What?
Tell me that's not a woman's car parked out front.
Fiona's a big girl.
Fiona takes care of everyone, but no one takes care of Fiona.
Is this about Candace?
Because Fiona knows about Candace.
She wouldn't do anything;
too proud.
So we have to.
You're a sweet kid, Debs.
Did you purposefully order a "Sex on the Beach"
just so I'd say it to the gay bartender?
Maybe.
Maybe I was hoping you'd actually take me away someplace so we could have sex on a beach.
I could barely get you overnight in a local hotel.
Well, that was then;
this is now.
I just feel like I haven't seen a lot of you lately.
You-you mean that you'd like to see more of me?
Yes, I guess that's what I'm saying.
Usually by this time in a relationship, the guy starts just showing up for late-night booty calls or wants me to meet his mother.
Either way, I start looking for reasons to walk.
Well, my mom is in Michigan, so you don't have to worry.
I think that's the first time you've ever mentioned your family.
Really?
Not much to say.
I mean... they live in Michigan.
The whole state?
No, near Detroit.
Dad used to work for GM, so I try to send back what I can to help.
Family business...
he builds 'em, you steal 'em.
Come on, let's dance.
Come on.
Liam is officially asleep.
That was fast.
Yeah, well, three pages from Deb's Eat, Pray, Love and he's out.
And if James Franco wasn't in the movie,
I would've nodded off, too.
Have you got any cash you can float me?
Florence the Machine are playing down at the Chicago Theater.
I really want to take Karen for her birthday.
Pricey gift.
You think it's getting serious?
Fuck off.
She's my best friend.
Okay?
You know I'd never spend that kind of cash on a girl, anyway.
All right, well,
I got a Hamilton, and it's yours.
Thanks, man.
One, two, three.
God bless Jonah, my sweet baby boy.
And God bless my husband Clyde.
May those who are caring for him remind him to take his blood pressure supplement and his Glucosamine/Chondroitin supplement... so that he can bend down to pick up our child.
And God bless the other wives, who are probably on their knees right now asking you to bless me...
Separated from her kid?
That's got to suck.
Hopefully, the visit with him tomorrow will cheer her up.
I'm kind of excited about it.
Having a full house... two kids.
Don't get too excited.
It's only temporary.
Temporary, Kevin.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Are you gonna put those in my ass?
'Cause I'm not even gonna feel it.
They're earplugs, babe.
And they're for her.
Oh, good, 'cause that would've sucked, trying to fish those out.
Hey... hey...
Wakey, wakey, Jackie Chan.
Who the fuck are you?
I'm Frank.
Did we...?
Aw, now... now...
Chins up.
Fuck off.
How'd you know it was me?
I was talking to my Promisemakers group, and...
I want you to know that I understand that so much of your bad behavior is my responsibility.
If you leave a dog in the house alone for more than eight hours, you can't get mad at him for peeing the rug, right?
I found this...
in an album in the basement.
I don't know... maybe we can try to... capture more moments like these together.
Why is it that I feel like you can't get away from me fast enough?
Because you're paranoid!
Hey, whatever happened to that computer class you were gonna take?
They cancelled it.
Not enough people, I guess.
Liam's gonna be up in a second.
I got to get him fed and dressed and to the clinic for some shots.
Don't tell Jenny McCarthy.
Hey, Debs.
Steve.
Liam up yet?
Squawkin' a little.
So, everything cool with, uh, with you and Steve?
What?
Why?
No reason...
I'm just checking in.
Hi, baby bottoms!
Did you have sweet dreams?
I thought I was baby bottoms.
No.
I said you have a baby bottom.
Mm, I swore I would never date a guy whose ass was smaller than mine, but I seem to be breaking a lot of my own rules lately, don't I?
Don't I?
He's assuming that was rhetorical.
Hey, you want to come by tonight after Liam's down?
V gave me a copy of Queen of Outer Space.
Zsa Zsa Gabor at her finest.
We could watch it...
and not watch it.
I don't think
I can swing it.
I gotta go to work.
Okay.
Mm... ah.
Hey, Steve!
Debs, breakfast?
I'm good.
Breakfast!
Hey, Steve, can I get a ride to the library?
Motorcycle;
no can do.
When did you get motorcycle?
Always had one.
I guess there's a lot I don't know about you.
Truth?
I'm in the CIA, and this is all just a cover.
Any calls, Kate?
Yeah, actually, some A-hole was looking for you.
Left this number.
Hand me the phone, will ya?
Your tab is bigger than my ass, and you smell like kimchi and vomit.
Now, stop that.
Your ass looks great.
Like you in the sack, make it quick.
I wasn't quick, I was just busy that day.
Hello.
Yes.
I have Frank Gallagher calling.
Hey, Frankie.
Got great news.
Who-who... who the fuck is this?
Your settlement is in.
Yeah!
Which one?
Come see me, I'll give you the 411.
Hey, everybody!
Next round's on me!
Kev?
Veronica?
Didn't you just clean that yesterday?
Child Protective Services is bring my baby Jonah for a visit.
Everything has to be just so.
You're so lucky you have a baby.
How old are you?
Ten and a quarter.
Two more years, and you'll be old enough to start trying.
Does it hurt?
Sexual relations or childbirth?
Both.
Yes.
Oh, fuck!
He's such a douche bag.
He's on this whole father- daughter Purity Ball kick.
He wants me to take a vow of celibacy so we can rekindle our father-daughter relationship.
Maybe we could not...
talk about your father right now.
Not what you had in mind for dirty talk.
Oh!
Not exactly.
Oh, fuck!
Oh, shit!
- Oh, shh, Carl's right outside.
Shh.
- Oh, fuck!
Oh, fuck!
Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!
- Keep going!
Oh...!
Yes?
Shatterproof, my ass!
Want to go to the planetarium tonight and get high?
I can't.
I'm busy.
Doing what?
Danielle?
The less you know, the better.
Are we still on for Friday night?
Yeah.
Can you give me a hint?
Yeah, but...
I'm not gonna.
Aha.
Crucial Confrontations.
Haven't seen you here in a while.
Been kind of busy, Simon.
I got a signed first edition of Harry Potter.
Overrated.
Made a better movie than a book.
And now with all those kid actors grown up, they're scarier looking than the villains.
Hey, can you help me on the computers?
What do you want to do?
Dig up some dirt.
Name.
Steve...
W-W-Wilson?
Wilton?
You kind of need to know what the name is before you can look it up.
Try Wilton, in Lake Forest.
There are zero in Illinois, but there are 15 of them nationwide.
Can you do it backwards?
Notliw?
No.
I mean, if I give you an address, can you work from there?
Hey, um, maybe sometime we could just casually hang out.
Fine.
Fine, yes, we can casually hang out.
1055 North Ave.
It says the property owners are Lloyd and Candace Lishman.
Hello, Ms. D-lish.
Cool, then we can, uh, hang out sometime?
We just did.
She opened an ING Direct Savings account.
I haven't kept any large bills in there for months.
Believe me, I've looked.
Do you know where she is?
No idea.
How much you need?
I've got to buy concert tickets.
Yikes.
Wish I had it.
Maybe you should take Mrs. Niedereiter up on her offer.
Well, that should do it, Mrs. Niedereiter.
There are a lot of dark corners around my house that could use some attention, Phillip.
Thanks for the idea.
You're not seriously gonna do it?
Well, no, but...
I could smash her birdhouse again.
Hey... what do you think of Steve?
Ass is kind of small;
not really my type.
You about to retreat and count your wounded?
No.
Just... just want to know if I should trust him.
That's like asking if you should believe in God.
Just be yourself.
Okay.
Okay.
Here we go.
Hi.
Come in.
Jonah, baby!
Mama missed you so much!
Hi, baby.
Hi.
Good afternoon.
I'm Kev.
Mm-hmm.
This is my wife, Veronica.
Hello.
Good afternoon.
How you doing?
I'm Andrea Johnson from DCFS, and I'm here to observe the home visit today.
So if everything go good, then Baby Jonah may stay overnight.
Is your voice dressed up for Halloween?
Excuse me?
Think we don't know how to...
raise a child?
Come to tell me I don't know how to be a mother.
Uh, you got it wrong, sister girl.
I'm here to see how Ethel mothers, not you.
What do you mean?
Oh, please, have a seat.
That girl's only 13 years old, but she's still got her parental rights.
I need to make sure the child can handle a child, you feel me?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I feel you.
Mm.
Oh!
Baby Jonah!
Look at you!
You're hung like a little bear, aren't you?
Hey, Andrea?
An-dray-ah.
An-dray-ah.
You think we could apply to get Baby Jonah as a foster kid, too?
That's gonna be a crap-load of paperwork for me, but we do encourage keeping family members together.
Yay!
All right, then, uh, Eddie's just down in the basement.
He'll be right up.
And, of course, you will all get your shoes back when you go, so don't worry.
It'd be great if mine came back shined.
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho...!
That would be great!
Ah, but at last came a knock, and I thought of the door with no lock to lock.
Robert Frost...
I was a poetry major in college.
Oh, sweetie.
Okay, open your Bibles to Psalms 127,
Okay, uh...
verses three to five.
Okay.
You guys are all... okay.
Oh, sweetie...
Oh!
Oh, you are ripe!
Oh, nothing a little Puerto Rican bath can't fix.
Oh... honey.
Where were you last night?
I had to spend the night with the kids.
They needed a little Frankie time.
Oh.
You're such a good dad.
- Oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
- Sorry, folks.
Had a little plumbing issue.
The house's, not mine.
♪ I wish I were a Beatle ♪
♪ I wish I were a Rolling Stone ♪
♪ I wish I'd always turn up, I wish I had nowhere to run ♪
♪ I wish I was somebody, I wish I was a great big star. ♪
Lou?
Frankie boy, how's it hanging?
Still from the left.
Where the hell are you?
Jesus, it's hard to take a piss with this thing on.
That's a lie.
It was the wiping that was tough.
This from the escalator thing at the mall?
No, no, no, this is the train doors closing on your ankle.
Right.
I haven't been the same since.
Yeah.
All I need is your signature and Monica's, and the money is all yours... with the exception of a third of it, that goes to me.
Plus expenses.
Sounds fair.
Me... and Monica.
Yay.
That was a hell of warm-up.
Unfortunately, those aren't the originals.
You two will have to go down to the city legal offices and do it in person.
What?
I'm supposed to take off work to go do this?
Of course not, because as you know, those injury's prevented you from working, remember?
Oh, shit.
Hey, look at that.
Client just went into labor.
Is that gonna be a problem, getting Monica to sign?
No.
Why-why would it be a problem?
If memory serves, she was a summa cum laude cunt.
Yeah, well, she was a lot of things.
You even know where she is?
I have a phone number.
I'll make it happen.
Uh-huh.
I hope so.
She's a joint claimant on this thing.
No Monica, no money.
Hey, do me a favor.
Will you feed the dogs before you go?
Bag of dog food in my desk drawer.
Thanks, buddy.
Uh...
Mmm!
All right, come on!
Get off of her!
Hey, man, it's, uh, it's Lip.
I'm calling you from a phone booth.
Just hit me back at whatever number comes up on your cell, all right?
It's important.
Hey, thanks for taking long enough to let me enjoy the scent of urine.
Yeah, I didn't even know that phone booths exist anymore.
What's up?
Sounded urgent.
Yeah, um, I was just wondering, do you think you can loan me a couple bills?
I can pay for a job.
You got a driver's license, right?
A few of 'em, yeah.
All right, meet me by the L at 11:00.
Are you screwing my sister's boyfriend?
If you're selling cookies, that's a hell of an opening line.
Do come in.
Can I get you something?
Milk?
Soda?
A joint?
It's medicinal.
No, thank you, Mrs. Lishman.
How do you know Steve?
Who is Steve?
He's my sister's boyfriend.
How nice.
So, he's not pushing it into you?
Hey, Mom, me and Chip are gonna swing by the hospital to see Dad, so you can relax now, okay?
Oh!
Thank you, Jimmy.
You take such good care of your mama bear.
Mmm!
Mmm!
Oh!
This is, uh...
Debbie.
Debbie Gallagher.
Nice to meet you...
Jimmy.
Jimmy is my youngest.
Top of his class at Michigan in med school.
He is going to be a cardio-thoracic surgeon like his big brother and his daddy.
And he has been taking such good care of me since his father went into the hospital.
A fender bender;
broke his kneecap.
And you know, doctors make the worst patients.
Oh, would you like to stay for dinner, sweetheart?
Oh shit!
I liked her.
Hello?
Hello?
Shit.
Shit.
Shit, shit, shit!
Frank?
Frank, I...
I certainly hope you're not pooping in there.
It's a closet.
Frank?
You didn't poop in there, did you?
I was waiting to surprise you.
Oh.
Surprise!
You got me!
Oh, Frankie.
Hey, do me a favor?
Call this number, and, and ask if Monica is there.
And if she is, tell her...
Congratulations!
She's won!
Who's Monica?
Doesn't matter.
What'd she win?
Uh...
I don't know.
Whatever.
Uh... a lottery, something.
A lottery?
A prize.
A teddy bear.
What for?
Jesus, with the questions already!
Just call, say..
It's a teddy bear.
And a hundred bucks.
And she has to pick it up.
Just say that.
Well...
I hope this Monica, whoever she is, worked really hard for that prize.
Sheils...
I didn't get a teddy bear!
Sheils...
Shit.
Hey.
Come on.
She didn't really win a teddy bear.
But you want to know what?
If I was giving away teddy bears, you would be absolutely top of the list.
If you will do this for me,
I will dress up any way you want, no safety word.
Is this Monica?
Well, hello.
This is Sheila, from Market Promotions.
Can I ask you where you do all of yr grocery shopping?
Well, yes, that's right!
You've won!
First prize!
Congratulations!
It's $100.
Yes.
And, um...
What?
Teddy bear.
Teddy bear.
And, and a teddy bear.
And a great big teddy bear.
Hello?
Yeah...
She's crying.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, yeah, no, I've never won anything either.
Aw...
It's so great.
Yeah.
I'm thrilled.
I'm thrilled for you.
Get to the fucking point.
Anyway, prizes will be given out at 3:00.
At the store.
Yes.
WGN's own Tom Skilling will be presenting.
She doesn't know who Tom Skilling is.
I don't know who fucking Tom...
He does the weather.
Tom Skilling, he does the weather on WGN.
Anyway, 3:00 on the dot.
Jim Ramsey might be there, too.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
He does weekend weather.
Okay... okay...
Congratulations!
See you there, Monica!
What did she say?
Is she, is she, is she coming?
How can you not know who two of Chicago's weathermen are?
What kind of person is this Monica?
Is she coming to get the fucking prize or not?
Yeah.
She...
oh, she's going.
She's... she's excited about that teddy bear.
You know, not sure I can prove it, but...
I think it's colder on the North Side.
Let me take you home, Debs.
I'm not supposed to take rides from strangers.
And it's clear that you are a stranger.
Oh, man.
Are you gonna tell Fiona?
Exactly what am I supposed to tell her?
That your name isn't Steve?
That you have a family in Chicago she's never met?
Or that your mom kisses you on the lips?
Which is really gross, by the way.
Life gets really complicated when you're an adult.
I mean, you can't possibly understand these things right now.
I understand that you lied to my sister.
Why?
Because I was raised by a pack of wolves.
Just like you were.
Only my wolves went to Harvard.
You know they have Red Wolves at Lincoln Park Zoo.
Maybe we could go check them out sometime.
Trying to distract me by asking me out on a date?
I do not want to be a doctor.
I do not want to be like the rest of my family.
What I want is Fiona.
I love her!
Love is fleeting, Jimmy.
What are your intentions?
You're distracting her, and I need her in the game for at least a few more years.
I can't have you breaking her heart, or running off with her.
So if you're not serious about sticking around, back off now.
I bought her a house.
Is that serious enough?
You what?
Come on.
I'll show you.
Really?
Yeah.
Yes!
Yes!
This was Mr. Harris's house.
They said he died of lung cancer, but we're all pretty sure it was full-blown AIDS.
Oh.
My.
God.
Has Fiona seen it?
No, she doesn't know about it yet.
I was going to, you know, fix it up a bit, and surprise her when the time is right.
Think we could build an above-ground walkway that connects the two houses?
What, like a Habitrail tube?
That would be awesome.
Are you going to tell Fiona?
Don't know yet, Jimmy.
Saw a really cool pink vest at the mall.
Really?
And I could use a new rolling pin and flour sifter.
Sheila's teaching me how to bake.
Anything else?
Not for the moment.
So... which room will be mine when I sleep over?
Not going out with that Gallagher degenerate tonight?
Good.
You deserve better.
I've been reading more about this Purity Ball thing.
It says here you can
"re-dedicate yourself as a virgin."
Start over.
Isn't that nice?
I mean, you show up, confess your transgressions, and pledge yourself to be pure again, in the eyes of the Lord.
I'll give you the damn car.
Really?
Fiona would be pissed if she knew you were into this shit with me.
Well, what she doesn't know won't hurt her, right?
All right.
Task at hand.
You'll be driving the follow car.
The golden rule:
always use a follow car.
Nice silver Mercedes.
Nice security camera at the intersection.
Wait, why don't we head up to some asshole town, like Lake Forest?
Plenty of douche-mobiles up there.
No.
No, I was just thinking that, you know...
Listen, no.
200 bucks to follow me after I lift the car, you get your concert tickets, I get my work done.
That's it.
Okay?
All right, man.
Shit.
Rule number two:
always remember where you park the follow car.
Fuck.
Monica.
Monica?
Deb.
Jimmy.
Fiona's next door with Liam.
That my "shut-up gift"?
Well, I like to think of it as a peace offering.
Peace offering implies a one-time thing.
This could take a while.
How long?
Till I'm sure that you're not still lying.
Okay.
I gotta get back up to Lake Forest.
They're releasing my dad from the hospital.
I'm gonna pick him up, I'm gonna take him home.
You know everything there is to know.
No more secrets.
I promise.
Sifter sifts, and rolling pin rolls.
Nice when things do what the say they will.
Jimmy.
Steve.
Is this your idea of a joke, huh?
'Cause you're scared of women with an opinion, yeah?
Yeah, watch this crinkle-dick.
I'll show you what's funny when I rip your fucking face off your fuckin' head!
Out of the way, Monica!
- Get out of the way now!
- Put the shovel down.
Please!
I'm sorry.
Who lies about a teddy bear?
Wasting my fucking time.
Are you sure this is even the right store?
Yes.
They specifically said this store?
Yes, I told you yes.
I wrote it down.
I wrote everything down.
Stop talking to me like I'm stupid.
Frank?
Frank!
What?
!
Frank!
Start the car!
What?
Go, go, go!
What the fuck, Frank?
She saw me.
What's going on?
Come on, we gotta get outta here!
Go!
I'm gonna rip it off when I catch you!
Can't this piece of shit go any faster?
!
No.
Monica's batting for the other team.
What?
!
My wife's a fucking lesbian!
Shit!
Hmph!
♪ You're gonna look over, you never know what you'll find... ♪
Go!
Go!
Shut up, Frank!
Go!
Go!
♪ But we'll stop, but we'll stop ♪
♪ But we'll stop!
♪
Fuck off, lesbos!
I would say my advice to you would be to let Fiona live in her own relationship.
You can't do it for her.
There's things you should know.
Well, sometimes, sweetie, when people are in love, they don't tell someone everything for a reason.
That's like lying.
No, sweetie, it's just...
it's a little editing.
Now the sifting.
See?
We separate and aerate those flour particles to make them absorb liquids better.
Someone should sift my dad.
Oh, you Gallaghers.
You're all so funny.
Frank!
This is bullshit, Frank!
Bar the door!
Lock the door!
What is happening?
!
It's okay, Sheila.
It's just my dad.
I thought we lost 'em.
Did you even have a plan back there?
I was going to charm her into signing once she was there.
How the hell was I supposed to know she would show up with ghetto Godzilla in a Peterbilt.
I am seriously this close to punching you in the dick.
Get...
They're just girls.
Stop.
You talk to them.
I need the key to the back door.
That is not a sexual euphemism.
I need the fucking key.
What did you do with it?
I-I-I don't know.
I can't think when you yell, Frank.
I'm not yelling.
What'd you do with the key?
You're still yelling.
I need the key, Sheila.
Okay, okay, it's by the...
it's by the... it's by the washing machine.
It's not by the washing machine.
Yes, it is.
I put it by the washing machine.
It's not by the...
Mom.
It-it's Mom.
Debbie.
Oh, my sweet pea.
What the fuck are you looking at?
!
Hey, look, I got nothing to do with it, all right?
I'm just the driver.
Sit.
Sit your ass down.
Oh...
That was a nasty trick.
Even for you, Frank.
I had my heart set on that teddy bear.
Oh, poor Monica.
Well, what about your kids?
!
Remember?
The six kids?
Youngest was only two months old before you ran off.
Ended up with...
fucking Shrek here.
You want me to step in here, Monica?
No, I didn't leave you, Frank.
Yes, you did.
I didn't choose to leave my family.
You almost destroyed me.
When I turned up at Roberta's that night,
- I was an...
- Emotional cripple!
Oh, bullshit.
With not one ounce of self-respect.
You almost destroyed me.
I'm gonna start crying.
You drove me into the ground, Frank.
You-you robbed me of any sense of dignity
I ever had, and...
Where's the rest of the kids?
They're out playing.
They live down at Fiona's.
You mind putting some bags on?
Can you... can you put some bags on your feet?
Bags on my feet?
- Take your shoes off.
- I need you to put bags on.
Don't, don't don't.
Hell hath no fury like popcorn burned.
Is Steve coming?
Hope so.
Are you guys going to make a baby while we watch Cosmos?
'Cause that's going to make me throw up.
Billions and billions of sperm.
Ew!
Steve, please turn it on already.
Yeah, hurry up.
I gotta get back to work.
Ooh!
Cool.
Hey.
And what our faith may be.
Missed you, stranger.
You, too.
Get a room.
- Get your tickets?
- Oh, yeah.
Thanks.
Glad I could help.
Glad you're glad.
Steve.
And birds...
Oh, this popcorn's burnt.
Our microwave sucks.
That doesn't mean I want you to buy us a new one.
The universe is smaller than atoms.
But it's also the story of our own planet.
Debs?
Honey, what happened?
What, Dad have one too many again?
You just got to ignore him when he's like that, Debs.
Why do you always blame Dad first?
Who else is there?
She's over at Sheila's.
Who?
Monica.
Relationships of the awesome machinery of nature.
Who the hell is Monica?
Her mother.
On this shore, we've learned...
Debs.
What do you care?
!
You'll be living with Steve in that house he bought next door!
Some part of our being knows...
Surprise.
Because the cosmos is also within us.
We're made of star stuff.
I'm going to work.
Ian, come on, wait.
Mommy!
Mommy!
I know.
Mommy!
Mommy!
Worlds of ice and stars of diamonds.
Atoms and masses...
What the fuck?
I need to see you.
- Not a good time.
- Who keeps hanging their fucking laundry on my pull-up bar?
!
I-I-I don't know where else to go.
I thought you were working today.
Uh, Linda's gonna have my ass.
I'm supposed to be there now.
I'll meet you there in 20.
Oh, bullshit!
You physically abused me.
What?
!
When?
!
The Fourth of July.
Oh, come on, you hit me in the face with a tray of apple pan dowdy.
And you hit me back.
Yeah, after you broke my nose and scratched my cornea.
Oh, yeah?
What about this?
Oh, come on, you started that one.
And I'll finish it if you lay a finger on her.
Roberta...
Bob.
Only Moni called me Roberta.
All right, well Bob, we're just in the way here and we should make our exit and leave Monica for her apologies.
Apologies?
For walking out on this piece of shit?
No, for walking out on them.
Oh, my God.
It's all right.
I'm not one of yours.
Just came to rubberneck.
Alhamdu lillah!
Ian, I did it.
Linda's pregnant.
Ian.
Finally knocked her up.
Where are you?
I did it.
It's over.
What the fuck?
!
Sign the name!
Sign the name!
You're all so big.
I missed you so much.
Well, why didn't you take us with you?
Because...
I knew you'd be fine with Fiona.
Fucking right you keep your mouth shut.
You better keep it shut.
You hear me?
Put the candy back, Mickey.
Mm.
That's sweet.
I like 'em sweet.
But then, uh... so do you, huh?
Huh?
Put it back.
Now.
Fuck!
Kash, what are you doing?
It's a fucking Snickers bar!
Fuck!
Holy shit!
Jesus Chr...!
You okay?
Fuck!
Hey, hey, listen to me.
You fuckin' suck!
Thought you were at work.
There was a shooting.
Mickey and Kash.
Holy shit, Mickey shot Kash?
Kash shot Mickey.
What?
In the leg.
He's fine.
I just wanted to get out of there before the cops got there.
What'd I miss with Mom?
Well, you know how Dad's a total fucking asshole?
Yeah.
Turns out he's the good one.
Oh, I can't believe you sucked me back in here for money!
I did no such thing.
But since you're in town, why don't you sign up for this little thing and I will cut you in...
Oh, fuck you, Frank!
Wait, you brought her back here?
Oh, Ian.
Wait, you knew where she was the whole time?
Okay, look, this little reunion was bound to happen sooner or later anyway.
We were thinking about coming around to talk to you about something else.
No, no...
Yes, now.
Yes, now.
Moni and I want to take Liam to live with us.
What?
!
Over my dead body.
How about Moni sign whatever the hell it is you need... we get Liam.
Done.
No fucking way!
You can't have Liam.
Why the hell not?
He's not even Frank's.
Fact is,
Liam is black.
All you white folks scooping up black babies like fashion accessories have a rude awakening coming.
There will be a backlash if people don't stop underestimating the cultural importance of a black parent raising a black baby.
Liam needs me and he's coming with us.
Out of the fucking question, Roberta.
Roberta and I want to start a family of our own.
Well, how about you finish this one first.
They're taking Liam?
No!
Yes!
No, nobody's taking anyone anywhere.
You don't get to abandon your kids and then show up one day to take your pick of the litter.
Oh, now that's not fair.
Your mother's made mistakes, but she's here now.
- That's got to count for something.
- Shut up, Frank!
This isn't about you.
This is about you.
This is about what you didn't do.
It's about what I did.
And you know what?
I did a fucking great job.
Debbie is class president.
She's on the debate team, going to nationals.
And Lip, he's top of his class.
He set the curve.
Ian was promoted in ROTC and he tested out of English.
And Carl made something blow up for his science fair.
And you know what, they did it all, no thanks to you!
Because you weren't here!
And I appreciate that, Fiona.
But I'm here now.
And Liam belongs with me.
He doesn't even know who you are.
I'm his mother!
You were my mother, too!
I don't!
I don't know!
Maybe I'll never be able to make things right with you... but there's still time with Liam.
And Debbie and Carl,
I am so sorry if I hurt you.
See, I love you so much.
Please let me be your mommy again.
Please?
You know what?
You're right.
You are their mother.
And you're here now.
So I'm done.
I'm done with the school and the bills and the clinics.
I'm done.
They're all yours now, Mom.
Good luck.

Show me the house?
Yeah.
Oh, man, you guys missed a great party last week.
Say hello to your new foster family, Ethel.
You're one of five wives?
Married to a dude named Clyde?
Who's 65 years old?
Would it be all right if my son Jonah came to visit?
Keep laughing, and I will slit your throat while you sleep.
Shoplifting is out of hand.
Did Mickey pay for that?
You have to stand up to him.
Tried that once with his father.
Now hold it like you want to do something with it.
Mickey?
Again?
What was I supposed to do, shoot him over a cup of soup?
No touching the forbidden fruit until I'm knocked up.
Slept with someone.
Not cash.
Guess this was like a booty call, huh?
Yes.
Steve got a text from Candace.
Is he dating someone else?
Who the fuck is Candace?
We work together.
That's all.
I'm home.
Little brother!
Hey, you.
Mmm.

Okay, but you got to promise.
Okay, I promise...
I won't tell Fiona.
Now, whose house is this?
I'm not sure.
What the hell are we doing here?
Trying to find out if Steve's cheating.
What?
Tell me that's not a woman's car parked out front.
Fiona's a big girl.
Fiona takes care of everyone, but no one takes care of Fiona.
Is this about Candace?
Because Fiona knows about Candace.
She wouldn't do anything;
too proud.
So we have to.
You're a sweet kid, Debs.
Did you purposefully order a "Sex on the Beach"
just so I'd say it to the gay bartender?
Maybe.
Maybe I was hoping you'd actually take me away someplace so we could have sex on a beach.
I could barely get you overnight in a local hotel.
Well, that was then;
this is now.
I just feel like I haven't seen a lot of you lately.
You-you mean that you'd like to see more of me?
Yes, I guess that's what I'm saying.
Usually by this time in a relationship, the guy starts just showing up for late-night booty calls or wants me to meet his mother.
Either way, I start looking for reasons to walk.
Well, my mom is in Michigan, so you don't have to worry.
I think that's the first time you've ever mentioned your family.
Really?
Not much to say.
I mean... they live in Michigan.
The whole state?
No, near Detroit.
Dad used to work for GM, so I try to send back what I can to help.
Family business...
he builds 'em, you steal 'em.
Come on, let's dance.
Come on.
Liam is officially asleep.
That was fast.
Yeah, well, three pages from Deb's Eat, Pray, Love and he's out.
And if James Franco wasn't in the movie,
I would've nodded off, too.
Have you got any cash you can float me?
Florence the Machine are playing down at the Chicago Theater.
I really want to take Karen for her birthday.
Pricey gift.
You think it's getting serious?
Fuck off.
She's my best friend.
Okay?
You know I'd never spend that kind of cash on a girl, anyway.
All right, well,
I got a Hamilton, and it's yours.
Thanks, man.
One, two, three.
God bless Jonah, my sweet baby boy.
And God bless my husband Clyde.
May those who are caring for him remind him to take his blood pressure supplement and his Glucosamine/Chondroitin supplement... so that he can bend down to pick up our child.
And God bless the other wives, who are probably on their knees right now asking you to bless me...
Separated from her kid?
That's got to suck.
Hopefully, the visit with him tomorrow will cheer her up.
I'm kind of excited about it.
Having a full house... two kids.
Don't get too excited.
It's only temporary.
Temporary, Kevin.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Are you gonna put those in my ass?
'Cause I'm not even gonna feel it.
They're earplugs, babe.
And they're for her.
Oh, good, 'cause that would've sucked, trying to fish those out.
Hey... hey...
Wakey, wakey, Jackie Chan.
Who the fuck are you?
I'm Frank.
Did we...?
Aw, now... now...
Chins up.
Fuck off.
How'd you know it was me?
I was talking to my Promisemakers group, and...
I want you to know that I understand that so much of your bad behavior is my responsibility.
If you leave a dog in the house alone for more than eight hours, you can't get mad at him for peeing the rug, right?
I found this...
in an album in the basement.
I don't know... maybe we can try to... capture more moments like these together.
Why is it that I feel like you can't get away from me fast enough?
Because you're paranoid!
Hey, whatever happened to that computer class you were gonna take?
They cancelled it.
Not enough people, I guess.
Liam's gonna be up in a second.
I got to get him fed and dressed and to the clinic for some shots.
Don't tell Jenny McCarthy.
Hey, Debs.
Steve.
Liam up yet?
Squawkin' a little.
So, everything cool with, uh, with you and Steve?
What?
Why?
No reason...
I'm just checking in.
Hi, baby bottoms!
Did you have sweet dreams?
I thought I was baby bottoms.
No.
I said you have a baby bottom.
Mm, I swore I would never date a guy whose ass was smaller than mine, but I seem to be breaking a lot of my own rules lately, don't I?
Don't I?
He's assuming that was rhetorical.
Hey, you want to come by tonight after Liam's down?
V gave me a copy of Queen of Outer Space.
Zsa Zsa Gabor at her finest.
We could watch it...
and not watch it.
I don't think
I can swing it.
I gotta go to work.
Okay.
Mm... ah.
Hey, Steve!
Debs, breakfast?
I'm good.
Breakfast!
Hey, Steve, can I get a ride to the library?
Motorcycle;
no can do.
When did you get motorcycle?
Always had one.
I guess there's a lot I don't know about you.
Truth?
I'm in the CIA, and this is all just a cover.
Any calls, Kate?
Yeah, actually, some A-hole was looking for you.
Left this number.
Hand me the phone, will ya?
Your tab is bigger than my ass, and you smell like kimchi and vomit.
Now, stop that.
Your ass looks great.
Like you in the sack, make it quick.
I wasn't quick, I was just busy that day.
Hello.
Yes.
I have Frank Gallagher calling.
Hey, Frankie.
Got great news.
Who-who... who the fuck is this?
Your settlement is in.
Yeah!
Which one?
Come see me, I'll give you the 411.
Hey, everybody!
Next round's on me!
Kev?
Veronica?
Didn't you just clean that yesterday?
Child Protective Services is bring my baby Jonah for a visit.
Everything has to be just so.
You're so lucky you have a baby.
How old are you?
Ten and a quarter.
Two more years, and you'll be old enough to start trying.
Does it hurt?
Sexual relations or childbirth?
Both.
Yes.
Oh, fuck!
He's such a douche bag.
He's on this whole father- daughter Purity Ball kick.
He wants me to take a vow of celibacy so we can rekindle our father-daughter relationship.
Maybe we could not...
talk about your father right now.
Not what you had in mind for dirty talk.
Oh!
Not exactly.
Oh, fuck!
Oh, shit!
- Oh, shh, Carl's right outside.
Shh.
- Oh, fuck!
Oh, fuck!
Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!
- Keep going!
Oh...!
Yes?
Shatterproof, my ass!
Want to go to the planetarium tonight and get high?
I can't.
I'm busy.
Doing what?
Danielle?
The less you know, the better.
Are we still on for Friday night?
Yeah.
Can you give me a hint?
Yeah, but...
I'm not gonna.
Aha.
Crucial Confrontations.
Haven't seen you here in a while.
Been kind of busy, Simon.
I got a signed first edition of Harry Potter.
Overrated.
Made a better movie than a book.
And now with all those kid actors grown up, they're scarier looking than the villains.
Hey, can you help me on the computers?
What do you want to do?
Dig up some dirt.
Name.
Steve...
W-W-Wilson?
Wilton?
You kind of need to know what the name is before you can look it up.
Try Wilton, in Lake Forest.
There are zero in Illinois, but there are 15 of them nationwide.
Can you do it backwards?
Notliw?
No.
I mean, if I give you an address, can you work from there?
Hey, um, maybe sometime we could just casually hang out.
Fine.
Fine, yes, we can casually hang out.
1055 North Ave.
It says the property owners are Lloyd and Candace Lishman.
Hello, Ms. D-lish.
Cool, then we can, uh, hang out sometime?
We just did.
She opened an ING Direct Savings account.
I haven't kept any large bills in there for months.
Believe me, I've looked.
Do you know where she is?
No idea.
How much you need?
I've got to buy concert tickets.
Yikes.
Wish I had it.
Maybe you should take Mrs. Niedereiter up on her offer.
Well, that should do it, Mrs. Niedereiter.
There are a lot of dark corners around my house that could use some attention, Phillip.
Thanks for the idea.
You're not seriously gonna do it?
Well, no, but...
I could smash her birdhouse again.
Hey... what do you think of Steve?
Ass is kind of small;
not really my type.
You about to retreat and count your wounded?
No.
Just... just want to know if I should trust him.
That's like asking if you should believe in God.
Just be yourself.
Okay.
Okay.
Here we go.
Hi.
Come in.
Jonah, baby!
Mama missed you so much!
Hi, baby.
Hi.
Good afternoon.
I'm Kev.
Mm-hmm.
This is my wife, Veronica.
Hello.
Good afternoon.
How you doing?
I'm Andrea Johnson from DCFS, and I'm here to observe the home visit today.
So if everything go good, then Baby Jonah may stay overnight.
Is your voice dressed up for Halloween?
Excuse me?
Think we don't know how to...
raise a child?
Come to tell me I don't know how to be a mother.
Uh, you got it wrong, sister girl.
I'm here to see how Ethel mothers, not you.
What do you mean?
Oh, please, have a seat.
That girl's only 13 years old, but she's still got her parental rights.
I need to make sure the child can handle a child, you feel me?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I feel you.
Mm.
Oh!
Baby Jonah!
Look at you!
You're hung like a little bear, aren't you?
Hey, Andrea?
An-dray-ah.
An-dray-ah.
You think we could apply to get Baby Jonah as a foster kid, too?
That's gonna be a crap-load of paperwork for me, but we do encourage keeping family members together.
Yay!
All right, then, uh, Eddie's just down in the basement.
He'll be right up.
And, of course, you will all get your shoes back when you go, so don't worry.
It'd be great if mine came back shined.
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho...!
That would be great!
Ah, but at last came a knock, and I thought of the door with no lock to lock.
Robert Frost...
I was a poetry major in college.
Oh, sweetie.
Okay, open your Bibles to Psalms 127,
Okay, uh...
verses three to five.
Okay.
You guys are all... okay.
Oh, sweetie...
Oh!
Oh, you are ripe!
Oh, nothing a little Puerto Rican bath can't fix.
Oh... honey.
Where were you last night?
I had to spend the night with the kids.
They needed a little Frankie time.
Oh.
You're such a good dad.
- Oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
- Sorry, folks.
Had a little plumbing issue.
The house's, not mine.
♪ I wish I were a Beatle ♪
♪ I wish I were a Rolling Stone ♪
♪ I wish I'd always turn up, I wish I had nowhere to run ♪
♪ I wish I was somebody, I wish I was a great big star. ♪
Lou?
Frankie boy, how's it hanging?
Still from the left.
Where the hell are you?
Jesus, it's hard to take a piss with this thing on.
That's a lie.
It was the wiping that was tough.
This from the escalator thing at the mall?
No, no, no, this is the train doors closing on your ankle.
Right.
I haven't been the same since.
Yeah.
All I need is your signature and Monica's, and the money is all yours... with the exception of a third of it, that goes to me.
Plus expenses.
Sounds fair.
Me... and Monica.
Yay.
That was a hell of warm-up.
Unfortunately, those aren't the originals.
You two will have to go down to the city legal offices and do it in person.
What?
I'm supposed to take off work to go do this?
Of course not, because as you know, those injury's prevented you from working, remember?
Oh, shit.
Hey, look at that.
Client just went into labor.
Is that gonna be a problem, getting Monica to sign?
No.
Why-why would it be a problem?
If memory serves, she was a summa cum laude cunt.
Yeah, well, she was a lot of things.
You even know where she is?
I have a phone number.
I'll make it happen.
Uh-huh.
I hope so.
She's a joint claimant on this thing.
No Monica, no money.
Hey, do me a favor.
Will you feed the dogs before you go?
Bag of dog food in my desk drawer.
Thanks, buddy.
Uh...
Mmm!
All right, come on!
Get off of her!
Hey, man, it's, uh, it's Lip.
I'm calling you from a phone booth.
Just hit me back at whatever number comes up on your cell, all right?
It's important.
Hey, thanks for taking long enough to let me enjoy the scent of urine.
Yeah, I didn't even know that phone booths exist anymore.
What's up?
Sounded urgent.
Yeah, um, I was just wondering, do you think you can loan me a couple bills?
I can pay for a job.
You got a driver's license, right?
A few of 'em, yeah.
All right, meet me by the L at 11:00.
Are you screwing my sister's boyfriend?
If you're selling cookies, that's a hell of an opening line.
Do come in.
Can I get you something?
Milk?
Soda?
A joint?
It's medicinal.
No, thank you, Mrs. Lishman.
How do you know Steve?
Who is Steve?
He's my sister's boyfriend.
How nice.
So, he's not pushing it into you?
Hey, Mom, me and Chip are gonna swing by the hospital to see Dad, so you can relax now, okay?
Oh!
Thank you, Jimmy.
You take such good care of your mama bear.
Mmm!
Mmm!
Oh!
This is, uh...
Debbie.
Debbie Gallagher.
Nice to meet you...
Jimmy.
Jimmy is my youngest.
Top of his class at Michigan in med school.
He is going to be a cardio-thoracic surgeon like his big brother and his daddy.
And he has been taking such good care of me since his father went into the hospital.
A fender bender;
broke his kneecap.
And you know, doctors make the worst patients.
Oh, would you like to stay for dinner, sweetheart?
Oh shit!
I liked her.
Hello?
Hello?
Shit.
Shit.
Shit, shit, shit!
Frank?
Frank, I...
I certainly hope you're not pooping in there.
It's a closet.
Frank?
You didn't poop in there, did you?
I was waiting to surprise you.
Oh.
Surprise!
You got me!
Oh, Frankie.
Hey, do me a favor?
Call this number, and, and ask if Monica is there.
And if she is, tell her...
Congratulations!
She's won!
Who's Monica?
Doesn't matter.
What'd she win?
Uh...
I don't know.
Whatever.
Uh... a lottery, something.
A lottery?
A prize.
A teddy bear.
What for?
Jesus, with the questions already!
Just call, say..
It's a teddy bear.
And a hundred bucks.
And she has to pick it up.
Just say that.
Well...
I hope this Monica, whoever she is, worked really hard for that prize.
Sheils...
I didn't get a teddy bear!
Sheils...
Shit.
Hey.
Come on.
She didn't really win a teddy bear.
But you want to know what?
If I was giving away teddy bears, you would be absolutely top of the list.
If you will do this for me,
I will dress up any way you want, no safety word.
Is this Monica?
Well, hello.
This is Sheila, from Market Promotions.
Can I ask you where you do all of yr grocery shopping?
Well, yes, that's right!
You've won!
First prize!
Congratulations!
It's $100.
Yes.
And, um...
What?
Teddy bear.
Teddy bear.
And, and a teddy bear.
And a great big teddy bear.
Hello?
Yeah...
She's crying.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, yeah, no, I've never won anything either.
Aw...
It's so great.
Yeah.
I'm thrilled.
I'm thrilled for you.
Get to the fucking point.
Anyway, prizes will be given out at 3:00.
At the store.
Yes.
WGN's own Tom Skilling will be presenting.
She doesn't know who Tom Skilling is.
I don't know who fucking Tom...
He does the weather.
Tom Skilling, he does the weather on WGN.
Anyway, 3:00 on the dot.
Jim Ramsey might be there, too.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
He does weekend weather.
Okay... okay...
Congratulations!
See you there, Monica!
What did she say?
Is she, is she, is she coming?
How can you not know who two of Chicago's weathermen are?
What kind of person is this Monica?
Is she coming to get the fucking prize or not?
Yeah.
She...
oh, she's going.
She's... she's excited about that teddy bear.
You know, not sure I can prove it, but...
I think it's colder on the North Side.
Let me take you home, Debs.
I'm not supposed to take rides from strangers.
And it's clear that you are a stranger.
Oh, man.
Are you gonna tell Fiona?
Exactly what am I supposed to tell her?
That your name isn't Steve?
That you have a family in Chicago she's never met?
Or that your mom kisses you on the lips?
Which is really gross, by the way.
Life gets really complicated when you're an adult.
I mean, you can't possibly understand these things right now.
I understand that you lied to my sister.
Why?
Because I was raised by a pack of wolves.
Just like you were.
Only my wolves went to Harvard.
You know they have Red Wolves at Lincoln Park Zoo.
Maybe we could go check them out sometime.
Trying to distract me by asking me out on a date?
I do not want to be a doctor.
I do not want to be like the rest of my family.
What I want is Fiona.
I love her!
Love is fleeting, Jimmy.
What are your intentions?
You're distracting her, and I need her in the game for at least a few more years.
I can't have you breaking her heart, or running off with her.
So if you're not serious about sticking around, back off now.
I bought her a house.
Is that serious enough?
You what?
Come on.
I'll show you.
Really?
Yeah.
Yes!
Yes!
This was Mr. Harris's house.
They said he died of lung cancer, but we're all pretty sure it was full-blown AIDS.
Oh.
My.
God.
Has Fiona seen it?
No, she doesn't know about it yet.
I was going to, you know, fix it up a bit, and surprise her when the time is right.
Think we could build an above-ground walkway that connects the two houses?
What, like a Habitrail tube?
That would be awesome.
Are you going to tell Fiona?
Don't know yet, Jimmy.
Saw a really cool pink vest at the mall.
Really?
And I could use a new rolling pin and flour sifter.
Sheila's teaching me how to bake.
Anything else?
Not for the moment.
So... which room will be mine when I sleep over?
Not going out with that Gallagher degenerate tonight?
Good.
You deserve better.
I've been reading more about this Purity Ball thing.
It says here you can
"re-dedicate yourself as a virgin."
Start over.
Isn't that nice?
I mean, you show up, confess your transgressions, and pledge yourself to be pure again, in the eyes of the Lord.
I'll give you the damn car.
Really?
Fiona would be pissed if she knew you were into this shit with me.
Well, what she doesn't know won't hurt her, right?
All right.
Task at hand.
You'll be driving the follow car.
The golden rule:
always use a follow car.
Nice silver Mercedes.
Nice security camera at the intersection.
Wait, why don't we head up to some asshole town, like Lake Forest?
Plenty of douche-mobiles up there.
No.
No, I was just thinking that, you know...
Listen, no.
200 bucks to follow me after I lift the car, you get your concert tickets, I get my work done.
That's it.
Okay?
All right, man.
Shit.
Rule number two:
always remember where you park the follow car.
Fuck.
Monica.
Monica?
Deb.
Jimmy.
Fiona's next door with Liam.
That my "shut-up gift"?
Well, I like to think of it as a peace offering.
Peace offering implies a one-time thing.
This could take a while.
How long?
Till I'm sure that you're not still lying.
Okay.
I gotta get back up to Lake Forest.
They're releasing my dad from the hospital.
I'm gonna pick him up, I'm gonna take him home.
You know everything there is to know.
No more secrets.
I promise.
Sifter sifts, and rolling pin rolls.
Nice when things do what the say they will.
Jimmy.
Steve.
Is this your idea of a joke, huh?
'Cause you're scared of women with an opinion, yeah?
Yeah, watch this crinkle-dick.
I'll show you what's funny when I rip your fucking face off your fuckin' head!
Out of the way, Monica!
- Get out of the way now!
- Put the shovel down.
Please!
I'm sorry.
Who lies about a teddy bear?
Wasting my fucking time.
Are you sure this is even the right store?
Yes.
They specifically said this store?
Yes, I told you yes.
I wrote it down.
I wrote everything down.
Stop talking to me like I'm stupid.
Frank?
Frank!
What?
!
Frank!
Start the car!
What?
Go, go, go!
What the fuck, Frank?
She saw me.
What's going on?
Come on, we gotta get outta here!
Go!
I'm gonna rip it off when I catch you!
Can't this piece of shit go any faster?
!
No.
Monica's batting for the other team.
What?
!
My wife's a fucking lesbian!
Shit!
Hmph!
♪ You're gonna look over, you never know what you'll find... ♪
Go!
Go!
Shut up, Frank!
Go!
Go!
♪ But we'll stop, but we'll stop ♪
♪ But we'll stop!
♪
Fuck off, lesbos!
I would say my advice to you would be to let Fiona live in her own relationship.
You can't do it for her.
There's things you should know.
Well, sometimes, sweetie, when people are in love, they don't tell someone everything for a reason.
That's like lying.
No, sweetie, it's just...
it's a little editing.
Now the sifting.
See?
We separate and aerate those flour particles to make them absorb liquids better.
Someone should sift my dad.
Oh, you Gallaghers.
You're all so funny.
Frank!
This is bullshit, Frank!
Bar the door!
Lock the door!
What is happening?
!
It's okay, Sheila.
It's just my dad.
I thought we lost 'em.
Did you even have a plan back there?
I was going to charm her into signing once she was there.
How the hell was I supposed to know she would show up with ghetto Godzilla in a Peterbilt.
I am seriously this close to punching you in the dick.
Get...
They're just girls.
Stop.
You talk to them.
I need the key to the back door.
That is not a sexual euphemism.
I need the fucking key.
What did you do with it?
I-I-I don't know.
I can't think when you yell, Frank.
I'm not yelling.
What'd you do with the key?
You're still yelling.
I need the key, Sheila.
Okay, okay, it's by the...
it's by the... it's by the washing machine.
It's not by the washing machine.
Yes, it is.
I put it by the washing machine.
It's not by the...
Mom.
It-it's Mom.
Debbie.
Oh, my sweet pea.
What the fuck are you looking at?
!
Hey, look, I got nothing to do with it, all right?
I'm just the driver.
Sit.
Sit your ass down.
Oh...
That was a nasty trick.
Even for you, Frank.
I had my heart set on that teddy bear.
Oh, poor Monica.
Well, what about your kids?
!
Remember?
The six kids?
Youngest was only two months old before you ran off.
Ended up with...
fucking Shrek here.
You want me to step in here, Monica?
No, I didn't leave you, Frank.
Yes, you did.
I didn't choose to leave my family.
You almost destroyed me.
When I turned up at Roberta's that night,
- I was an...
- Emotional cripple!
Oh, bullshit.
With not one ounce of self-respect.
You almost destroyed me.
I'm gonna start crying.
You drove me into the ground, Frank.
You-you robbed me of any sense of dignity
I ever had, and...
Where's the rest of the kids?
They're out playing.
They live down at Fiona's.
You mind putting some bags on?
Can you... can you put some bags on your feet?
Bags on my feet?
- Take your shoes off.
- I need you to put bags on.
Don't, don't don't.
Hell hath no fury like popcorn burned.
Is Steve coming?
Hope so.
Are you guys going to make a baby while we watch Cosmos?
'Cause that's going to make me throw up.
Billions and billions of sperm.
Ew!
Steve, please turn it on already.
Yeah, hurry up.
I gotta get back to work.
Ooh!
Cool.
Hey.
And what our faith may be.
Missed you, stranger.
You, too.
Get a room.
- Get your tickets?
- Oh, yeah.
Thanks.
Glad I could help.
Glad you're glad.
Steve.
And birds...
Oh, this popcorn's burnt.
Our microwave sucks.
That doesn't mean I want you to buy us a new one.
The universe is smaller than atoms.
But it's also the story of our own planet.
Debs?
Honey, what happened?
What, Dad have one too many again?
You just got to ignore him when he's like that, Debs.
Why do you always blame Dad first?
Who else is there?
She's over at Sheila's.
Who?
Monica.
Relationships of the awesome machinery of nature.
Who the hell is Monica?
Her mother.
On this shore, we've learned...
Debs.
What do you care?
!
You'll be living with Steve in that house he bought next door!
Some part of our being knows...
Surprise.
Because the cosmos is also within us.
We're made of star stuff.
I'm going to work.
Ian, come on, wait.
Mommy!
Mommy!
I know.
Mommy!
Mommy!
Worlds of ice and stars of diamonds.
Atoms and masses...
What the fuck?
I need to see you.
- Not a good time.
- Who keeps hanging their fucking laundry on my pull-up bar?
!
I-I-I don't know where else to go.
I thought you were working today.
Uh, Linda's gonna have my ass.
I'm supposed to be there now.
I'll meet you there in 20.
Oh, bullshit!
You physically abused me.
What?
!
When?
!
The Fourth of July.
Oh, come on, you hit me in the face with a tray of apple pan dowdy.
And you hit me back.
Yeah, after you broke my nose and scratched my cornea.
Oh, yeah?
What about this?
Oh, come on, you started that one.
And I'll finish it if you lay a finger on her.
Roberta...
Bob.
Only Moni called me Roberta.
All right, well Bob, we're just in the way here and we should make our exit and leave Monica for her apologies.
Apologies?
For walking out on this piece of shit?
No, for walking out on them.
Oh, my God.
It's all right.
I'm not one of yours.
Just came to rubberneck.
Alhamdu lillah!
Ian, I did it.
Linda's pregnant.
Ian.
Finally knocked her up.
Where are you?
I did it.
It's over.
What the fuck?
!
Sign the name!
Sign the name!
You're all so big.
I missed you so much.
Well, why didn't you take us with you?
Because...
I knew you'd be fine with Fiona.
Fucking right you keep your mouth shut.
You better keep it shut.
You hear me?
Put the candy back, Mickey.
Mm.
That's sweet.
I like 'em sweet.
But then, uh... so do you, huh?
Huh?
Put it back.
Now.
Fuck!
Kash, what are you doing?
It's a fucking Snickers bar!
Fuck!
Holy shit!
Jesus Chr...!
You okay?
Fuck!
Hey, hey, listen to me.
You fuckin' suck!
Thought you were at work.
There was a shooting.
Mickey and Kash.
Holy shit, Mickey shot Kash?
Kash shot Mickey.
What?
In the leg.
He's fine.
I just wanted to get out of there before the cops got there.
What'd I miss with Mom?
Well, you know how Dad's a total fucking asshole?
Yeah.
Turns out he's the good one.
Oh, I can't believe you sucked me back in here for money!
I did no such thing.
But since you're in town, why don't you sign up for this little thing and I will cut you in...
Oh, fuck you, Frank!
Wait, you brought her back here?
Oh, Ian.
Wait, you knew where she was the whole time?
Okay, look, this little reunion was bound to happen sooner or later anyway.
We were thinking about coming around to talk to you about something else.
No, no...
Yes, now.
Yes, now.
Moni and I want to take Liam to live with us.
What?
!
Over my dead body.
How about Moni sign whatever the hell it is you need... we get Liam.
Done.
No fucking way!
You can't have Liam.
Why the hell not?
He's not even Frank's.
Fact is,
Liam is black.
All you white folks scooping up black babies like fashion accessories have a rude awakening coming.
There will be a backlash if people don't stop underestimating the cultural importance of a black parent raising a black baby.
Liam needs me and he's coming with us.
Out of the fucking question, Roberta.
Roberta and I want to start a family of our own.
Well, how about you finish this one first.
They're taking Liam?
No!
Yes!
No, nobody's taking anyone anywhere.
You don't get to abandon your kids and then show up one day to take your pick of the litter.
Oh, now that's not fair.
Your mother's made mistakes, but she's here now.
- That's got to count for something.
- Shut up, Frank!
This isn't about you.
This is about you.
This is about what you didn't do.
It's about what I did.
And you know what?
I did a fucking great job.
Debbie is class president.
She's on the debate team, going to nationals.
And Lip, he's top of his class.
He set the curve.
Ian was promoted in ROTC and he tested out of English.
And Carl made something blow up for his science fair.
And you know what, they did it all, no thanks to you!
Because you weren't here!
And I appreciate that, Fiona.
But I'm here now.
And Liam belongs with me.
He doesn't even know who you are.
I'm his mother!
You were my mother, too!
I don't!
I don't know!
Maybe I'll never be able to make things right with you... but there's still time with Liam.
And Debbie and Carl,
I am so sorry if I hurt you.
See, I love you so much.
Please let me be your mommy again.
Please?
You know what?
You're right.
You are their mother.
And you're here now.
So I'm done.
I'm done with the school and the bills and the clinics.
I'm done.
They're all yours now, Mom.
Good luck.

Oh, man, you guys missed a great party last week.
(coughs) Say hello to your new foster family, Ethel.
You're one of five wives?
Married to a dude named Clyde?
Who's 65 years old?
Would it be all right if my son Jonah came to visit?
Keep laughing, and I will slit your throat while you sleep.
LINDA:
Shoplifting is out of hand.
Did Mickey pay for that?
You have to stand up to him.
KASH:
Tried that once with his father.
Now hold it like you want to do something with it.
Mickey?
Again?
What was I supposed to do, shoot him over a cup of soup?
No touching the forbidden fruit until I'm knocked up.
IAN:
Slept with someone.
Not cash.
Guess this was like a booty call, huh?
Yes.
DEBBIE:
Steve got a text from Candace.
Is he dating someone else?
(yells) Who the fuck is Candace?
We work together.
That's all.
I'm home.
Little brother!
Hey, you.

DEBBIE:
Okay, but you got to promise.
Okay, I promise...
I won't tell Fiona.
Now, whose house is this?
I'm not sure.
VERONICA:
What the hell are we doing here?
Trying to find out if Steve's cheating.
What?
Tell me that's not a woman's car parked out front.
Fiona's a big girl.
Fiona takes care of everyone, but no one takes care of Fiona.
Is this about Candace?
Because Fiona knows about Candace.
She wouldn't do anything;
too proud.
So we have to.
You're a sweet kid, Debs.
(dance music throbbing)
Did you purposefully order a "Sex on the Beach"
just so I'd say it to the gay bartender?
Maybe.
Maybe I was hoping you'd actually take me away someplace so we could have sex on a beach.
I could barely get you overnight in a local hotel.
Well, that was then;
this is now.
I just feel like I haven't seen a lot of you lately.
You-you mean that you'd like to see more of me?
Yes, I guess that's what I'm saying.
Usually by this time in a relationship, the guy starts just showing up for late-night booty calls or wants me to meet his mother.
Either way, I start looking for reasons to walk.
Well, my mom is in Michigan, so you don't have to worry.
I think that's the first time you've ever mentioned your family.
Really?
Not much to say.
I mean... they live in Michigan.
The whole state?
No, near Detroit.
Dad used to work for GM, so I try to send back what I can to help.
Family business...
he builds 'em, you steal 'em.
Come on, let's dance.
Come on.
(door opens)
Liam is officially asleep.
That was fast.
Yeah, well, three pages from Deb's Eat, Pray, Love and he's out.
(laughs)
And if James Franco wasn't in the movie,
I would've nodded off, too.
(chuckles)
Have you got any cash you can float me?
Florence the Machine are playing down at the Chicago Theater.
I really want to take Karen for her birthday.
Pricey gift.
You think it's getting serious?
Fuck off.
She's my best friend.
(laughs)
Okay?
You know I'd never spend that kind of cash on a girl, anyway.
All right, well,
I got a Hamilton, and it's yours.
Thanks, man.
(Liam crying)
BOTH:
One, two, three.
(clicks tongue)
ETHEL:
God bless Jonah, my sweet baby boy.
And God bless my husband Clyde.
May those who are caring for him remind him to take his blood pressure supplement and his Glucosamine/Chondroitin supplement... so that he can bend down to pick up our child.
And God bless the other wives, who are probably on their knees right now asking you to bless me...
Separated from her kid?
That's got to suck.
Hopefully, the visit with him tomorrow will cheer her up.
I'm kind of excited about it.
Having a full house... two kids.
Don't get too excited.
It's only temporary.
Temporary, Kevin.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Are you gonna put those in my ass?
'Cause I'm not even gonna feel it.
They're earplugs, babe.
And they're for her.
Oh, good, 'cause that would've sucked, trying to fish those out.
(laughs)
(both groan)
Hey... hey...
Wakey, wakey, Jackie Chan.
(groans)
Who the fuck are you?
I'm Frank.
(groans)
Did we...?
(chuckles)
Aw, now... now...
(crying)
Chins up.
(gasps, groans)
KAREN:
Fuck off.
How'd you know it was me?
I was talking to my Promisemakers group, and...
I want you to know that I understand that so much of your bad behavior is my responsibility.
If you leave a dog in the house alone for more than eight hours, you can't get mad at him for peeing the rug, right?
I found this...
in an album in the basement.
I don't know... maybe we can try to... capture more moments like these together.
(blow dryer whirring)
Why is it that I feel like you can't get away from me fast enough?
(gasps, laughs)
Because you're paranoid!
Hey, whatever happened to that computer class you were gonna take?
They cancelled it.
Not enough people, I guess.
Liam's gonna be up in a second.
I got to get him fed and dressed and to the clinic for some shots.
Don't tell Jenny McCarthy.
Hey, Debs.
Steve.
Liam up yet?
Squawkin' a little.
So, everything cool with, uh, with you and Steve?
What?
Why?
No reason...
I'm just checking in.
(sighs)
Hi, baby bottoms!
Did you have sweet dreams?
I thought I was baby bottoms.
No.
I said you have a baby bottom.
Mm, I swore I would never date a guy whose ass was smaller than mine, but I seem to be breaking a lot of my own rules lately, don't I?
Don't I?
He's assuming that was rhetorical.
Hey, you want to come by tonight after Liam's down?
V gave me a copy of Queen of Outer Space.
Zsa Zsa Gabor at her finest.
We could watch it...
and not watch it.
I don't think
I can swing it.
I gotta go to work.
Okay.
Mm... ah.
Hey, Steve!
Debs, breakfast?
I'm good.
Breakfast!
Hey, Steve, can I get a ride to the library?
Motorcycle;
no can do.
When did you get motorcycle?
Always had one.
I guess there's a lot I don't know about you.
Truth?
I'm in the CIA, and this is all just a cover.
Any calls, Kate?
Yeah, actually, some A-hole was looking for you.
Left this number.
Hand me the phone, will ya?
Your tab is bigger than my ass, and you smell like kimchi and vomit.
Now, stop that.
Your ass looks great.
Like you in the sack, make it quick.
I wasn't quick, I was just busy that day. (scoffs)
WOMAN:
Hello.
(womanly):
Yes.
I have Frank Gallagher calling.
WOMAN:
Hey, Frankie.
Got great news.
Who-who... who the fuck is this?
Your settlement is in.
Yeah!
Which one?
Come see me, I'll give you the 411.
(laughing)
Hey, everybody!
Next round's on me!
(laughs)
DEBBIE:
Kev?
Veronica?
Didn't you just clean that yesterday?
Child Protective Services is bring my baby Jonah for a visit.
Everything has to be just so.
You're so lucky you have a baby.
How old are you?
Ten and a quarter.
Two more years, and you'll be old enough to start trying.
Does it hurt?
Sexual relations or childbirth?
Both.
Yes.
LIP (gasping):
Oh, fuck!
KAREN:
He's such a douche bag.
He's on this whole father- daughter Purity Ball kick.
(both moaning, gasping)
KAREN:
He wants me to take a vow of celibacy so we can rekindle our father-daughter relationship.
LIP:
Maybe we could not...
talk about your father right now.
KAREN:
Not what you had in mind for dirty talk.
LIP:
Oh!
Not exactly.
(moaning)
KAREN (laughs):
Oh, fuck!
Oh, shit!
LIP:
Oh, shh, Carl's right outside.
Shh.
KAREN:
Oh, fuck!
Oh, fuck!
KAREN:
Oh, shit!
(Lip and Karen moaning, gasping loudly)
LIP:
Oh, shit!
KAREN:
Keep going!
Oh...!
(both yell)
Yes?
Shatterproof, my ass!
(both sigh with satisfaction)
(kiss)
(Karen moans, Lip exhales)
(Lip sighing)
Want to go to the planetarium tonight and get high?
(panting)
I can't.
I'm busy.
Doing what?
Danielle?
The less you know, the better.
Are we still on for Friday night?
Yeah.
Can you give me a hint?
Yeah, but...
I'm not gonna.
(Lip sighs)
Aha.
Crucial Confrontations.
Haven't seen you here in a while.
Been kind of busy, Simon.
I got a signed first edition of Harry Potter.
Overrated.
Made a better movie than a book.
And now with all those kid actors grown up, they're scarier looking than the villains.
Hey, can you help me on the computers?
What do you want to do?
Dig up some dirt.
Name.
Steve...
W-W-Wilson?
Wilton?
You kind of need to know what the name is before you can look it up.
Try Wilton, in Lake Forest.
There are zero in Illinois, but there are 15 of them nationwide.
Can you do it backwards?
Notliw?
No.
I mean, if I give you an address, can you work from there?
Hey, um, maybe sometime we could just casually hang out.
Fine.
Fine, yes, we can casually hang out.
1055 North Ave.
It says the property owners are Lloyd and Candace Lishman.
Hello, Ms. D-lish.
Cool, then we can, uh, hang out sometime?
We just did.
(coins rattling)
She opened an ING Direct Savings account.
I haven't kept any large bills in there for months.
Believe me, I've looked.
Do you know where she is?
No idea.
How much you need?
I've got to buy concert tickets.
Yikes.
Wish I had it.
Maybe you should take Mrs. Niedereiter up on her offer.
Well, that should do it, Mrs. Niedereiter.
There are a lot of dark corners around my house that could use some attention, Phillip.
Thanks for the idea.
You're not seriously gonna do it?
Well, no, but...
I could smash her birdhouse again.
Hey... what do you think of Steve?
Ass is kind of small;
not really my type.
You about to retreat and count your wounded?
No.
Just... just want to know if I should trust him.
That's like asking if you should believe in God.
(knocking on door) Just be yourself.
Okay.
(knocking continues) Okay.
Here we go.
Hi.
Come in.
ETHEL:
Jonah, baby!
Mama missed you so much!
(quietly, gently):
Hi, baby.
Hi.
Good afternoon.
I'm Kev.
Mm-hmm.
This is my wife, Veronica.
Hello.
Good afternoon.
How you doing?
I'm Andrea Johnson from DCFS, and I'm here to observe the home visit today.
So if everything go good, then Baby Jonah may stay overnight.
Is your voice dressed up for Halloween?
Excuse me?
Think we don't know how to...
raise a child?
Come to tell me I don't know how to be a mother.
Uh, you got it wrong, sister girl.
I'm here to see how Ethel mothers, not you.
What do you mean?
Oh, please, have a seat.
That girl's only 13 years old, but she's still got her parental rights.
I need to make sure the child can handle a child, you feel me?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I feel you.
Mm.
(sighs)
Oh!
Baby Jonah!
Look at you!
You're hung like a little bear, aren't you?
Hey, Andrea?
An-dray-ah.
An-dray-ah.
You think we could apply to get Baby Jonah as a foster kid, too?
That's gonna be a crap-load of paperwork for me, but we do encourage keeping family members together.
(quietly):
Yay!
(footsteps approaching)
All right, then, uh, Eddie's just down in the basement.
He'll be right up.
And, of course, you will all get your shoes back when you go, so don't worry.
It'd be great if mine came back shined.
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho...!
(laughter)
That would be great!
(knocking on door)
Ah, but at last came a knock, and I thought of the door with no lock to lock.
Robert Frost...
I was a poetry major in college.
SHEILA:
Oh, sweetie.
Okay, open your Bibles to Psalms 127,
SHEILA:
Okay, uh...
verses three to five.
Okay.
You guys are all... okay.
(laughs) Oh, sweetie... (chuckles)
Oh!
Oh, you are ripe!
Oh, nothing a little Puerto Rican bath can't fix.
(laughing):
Oh... honey.
Where were you last night?
I had to spend the night with the kids.
They needed a little Frankie time.
Oh.
You're such a good dad.
(laughs)
Oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
EDDIE:
Sorry, folks.
Had a little plumbing issue.
The house's, not mine.

That's a lie.
It was the wiping that was tough.
This from the escalator thing at the mall?
No, no, no, this is the train doors closing on your ankle.
Right.
I haven't been the same since.
Yeah.
All I need is your signature and Monica's, and the money is all yours... with the exception of a third of it, that goes to me.
Plus expenses.
Sounds fair.
Me... and Monica.
Yay.
That was a hell of warm-up.
Unfortunately, those aren't the originals.
You two will have to go down to the city legal offices and do it in person.
What?
I'm supposed to take off work to go do this?
Of course not, because as you know, those injury's prevented you from working, remember?
Oh, shit.
(pager beeps)
Hey, look at that.
Client just went into labor.
Is that gonna be a problem, getting Monica to sign?
No.
Why-why would it be a problem?

Yeah, well, she was a lot of things.
You even know where she is?
I have a phone number.
I'll make it happen.
Uh-huh.
I hope so.
She's a joint claimant on this thing.
No Monica, no money.
Hey, do me a favor.
Will you feed the dogs before you go?
Bag of dog food in my desk drawer.
Thanks, buddy.
Uh...
(crunching)
Mmm!
All right, come on!
(dogs barking)
Get off of her!
Hey, man, it's, uh, it's Lip.
I'm calling you from a phone booth.
Just hit me back at whatever number comes up on your cell, all right?
It's important.
(phone rings)
Hey, thanks for taking long enough to let me enjoy the scent of urine.
Yeah, I didn't even know that phone booths exist anymore.
What's up?
Sounded urgent.
Yeah, um, I was just wondering, do you think you can loan me a couple bills?
I can pay for a job.
You got a driver's license, right?
A few of 'em, yeah.
All right, meet me by the L at 11:00.
Are you screwing my sister's boyfriend?
If you're selling cookies, that's a hell of an opening line.
Do come in.
Can I get you something?
Milk?
Soda?
A joint?
It's medicinal.
No, thank you, Mrs. Lishman.
How do you know Steve?
Who is Steve?
He's my sister's boyfriend.
How nice.
So, he's not pushing it into you?
(coughs)
Hey, Mom, me and Chip are gonna swing by the hospital to see Dad, so you can relax now, okay?
Oh!
Thank you, Jimmy.
You take such good care of your mama bear.
BOTH:
Mmm!
Mmm!
Oh!
This is, uh...
Debbie.
Debbie Gallagher.
Nice to meet you...
Jimmy.
Jimmy is my youngest.
Top of his class at Michigan in med school.
He is going to be a cardio-thoracic surgeon like his big brother and his daddy.
And he has been taking such good care of me since his father went into the hospital. (coughs)
A fender bender;
broke his kneecap.
And you know, doctors make the worst patients.
Oh, would you like to stay for dinner, sweetheart?
Oh shit!
I liked her.
(phone line ringing)
MUFFLED VOICE:
Hello?
Hello?
Shit.
Shit.
Shit, shit, shit!
Frank?
Frank, I...
I certainly hope you're not pooping in there.
It's a closet.
Frank?
You didn't poop in there, did you?
I was waiting to surprise you.
Oh.
Surprise!
(screams)
(laughing)
You got me!
Oh, Frankie.
Hey, do me a favor?
Call this number, and, and ask if Monica is there.
And if she is, tell her...
Congratulations!
She's won!
Who's Monica?
Doesn't matter.
What'd she win?
Uh...
I don't know.
Whatever.
Uh... a lottery, something.
A lottery?
A prize.
A teddy bear.
What for?
Jesus, with the questions already!
Just call, say..
It's a teddy bear.
And a hundred bucks.
And she has to pick it up.
Just say that.
Well...
I hope this Monica, whoever she is, worked really hard for that prize.
Sheils...
I didn't get a teddy bear!
Sheils...
Shit.
(gentle knocking)
Hey.
Come on.
She didn't really win a teddy bear.
But you want to know what?
(Sheila sniffs)
If I was giving away teddy bears, you would be absolutely top of the list.
(Sheila sniffs, blows nose)
(sniffling continues)
(Frank humming)
If you will do this for me,
I will dress up any way you want, no safety word.
Is this Monica?
Well, hello.
This is Sheila, from Market Promotions.
Can I ask you where you do all of yr grocery shopping?
Well, yes, that's right!
You've won!
First prize!
Congratulations!
It's $100.
Yes.
And, um... (very quietly):
What?
Teddy bear.
(whispering):
Teddy bear.
And, and a teddy bear.
And a great big teddy bear.
Hello?
Yeah...
She's crying.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, yeah, no, I've never won anything either.
Aw...
It's so great.
Yeah.
I'm thrilled.
I'm thrilled for you.
Get to the fucking point.
Anyway, prizes will be given out at 3:00.
At the store.
Yes.
WGN's own Tom Skilling will be presenting.
(whispering):
She doesn't know who Tom Skilling is.
I don't know who fucking Tom...
He does the weather.
Tom Skilling, he does the weather on WGN.
(mutters angrily) Anyway, 3:00 on the dot.
Jim Ramsey might be there, too.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
He does weekend weather.
Okay... okay...
Congratulations!
See you there, Monica!
What did she say?
Is she, is she, is she coming?
How can you not know who two of Chicago's weathermen are?
What kind of person is this Monica?
Is she coming to get the fucking prize or not?
Yeah.
She...
oh, she's going.
She's... she's excited about that teddy bear.
You know, not sure I can prove it, but...
I think it's colder on the North Side.
Let me take you home, Debs.
I'm not supposed to take rides from strangers.
And it's clear that you are a stranger.
Oh, man.
Are you gonna tell Fiona?
Exactly what am I supposed to tell her?
That your name isn't Steve?
That you have a family in Chicago she's never met?
Or that your mom kisses you on the lips?
Which is really gross, by the way.
Life gets really complicated when you're an adult.
I mean, you can't possibly understand these things right now.
I understand that you lied to my sister.
Why?
Because I was raised by a pack of wolves.
Just like you were.
Only my wolves went to Harvard.
You know they have Red Wolves at Lincoln Park Zoo.
Maybe we could go check them out sometime.
Trying to distract me by asking me out on a date?
I do not want to be a doctor.
I do not want to be like the rest of my family.
What I want is Fiona.
I love her!
Love is fleeting, Jimmy.
What are your intentions?
You're distracting her, and I need her in the game for at least a few more years.
I can't have you breaking her heart, or running off with her.
So if you're not serious about sticking around, back off now.
I bought her a house.
Is that serious enough?
You what?
Come on.
I'll show you.
Really?
Yeah.
Yes!
Yes!
DEBBIE:
This was Mr. Harris's house.
They said he died of lung cancer, but we're all pretty sure it was full-blown AIDS.
(laughing):
Oh.
My.
God.
Has Fiona seen it?
No, she doesn't know about it yet.
I was going to, you know, fix it up a bit, and surprise her when the time is right.
Think we could build an above-ground walkway that connects the two houses?
What, like a Habitrail tube?
(gasps) That would be awesome.
Are you going to tell Fiona?
Don't know yet, Jimmy.
Saw a really cool pink vest at the mall.
Really?
And I could use a new rolling pin and flour sifter.
Sheila's teaching me how to bake.
Anything else?
Not for the moment.
So... which room will be mine when I sleep over?
(phone rings)
(ring stops)
Not going out with that Gallagher degenerate tonight?
Good.
You deserve better.
I've been reading more about this Purity Ball thing.
It says here you can
"re-dedicate yourself as a virgin."
Start over.
Isn't that nice?
I mean, you show up, confess your transgressions, and pledge yourself to be pure again, in the eyes of the Lord.
I'll give you the damn car.
Really?
Fiona would be pissed if she knew you were into this shit with me.
LIP:
Well, what she doesn't know won't hurt her, right?
All right.
Task at hand.
You'll be driving the follow car.
The golden rule:
always use a follow car.
Nice silver Mercedes.
Nice security camera at the intersection.
Wait, why don't we head up to some asshole town, like Lake Forest?
Plenty of douche-mobiles up there.
No.
No, I was just thinking that, you know...
Listen, no.
200 bucks to follow me after I lift the car, you get your concert tickets, I get my work done.
That's it.
Okay?
All right, man.
Shit.
Rule number two:
always remember where you park the follow car.
Fuck.
Monica.
Monica?
Deb.
Jimmy.
Fiona's next door with Liam.
That my "shut-up gift"?
Well, I like to think of it as a peace offering.
Peace offering implies a one-time thing.
This could take a while.
How long?
Till I'm sure that you're not still lying.
Okay.
I gotta get back up to Lake Forest.
They're releasing my dad from the hospital.
I'm gonna pick him up, I'm gonna take him home.
You know everything there is to know.
No more secrets.
I promise.
Sifter sifts, and rolling pin rolls.
Nice when things do what the say they will.
Jimmy.
Steve.
Is this your idea of a joke, huh?
'Cause you're scared of women with an opinion, yeah?
Yeah, watch this crinkle-dick.
I'll show you what's funny when I rip your fucking face off your fuckin' head!
Out of the way, Monica!
Get out of the way now!
MONICA:
Put the shovel down.
Please!
I'm sorry.
Who lies about a teddy bear?
Wasting my fucking time.
Are you sure this is even the right store?
Yes.
They specifically said this store?
Yes, I told you yes.
I wrote it down.
I wrote everything down.
Stop talking to me like I'm stupid.
(sighs)
(sniffles)
Frank?
Frank!
What?
!
Frank!
(engine starting)
Start the car!
What?
(engine starting) Go, go, go!
What the fuck, Frank?
She saw me.
What's going on?
Come on, we gotta get outta here!
Go!
I'm gonna rip it off when I catch you!
Can't this piece of shit go any faster?
!
No.
Monica's batting for the other team.
What?
!
My wife's a fucking lesbian!
KEVIN:
Shit!
(truck horn blares)
Hmph!
♪ You're gonna look over, you never know what you'll find... ♪
Go!
Go!
Shut up, Frank!
Go!
Go!
♪ But we'll stop, but we'll stop ♪
♪ But we'll stop!
♪
FRANK:
Fuck off, lesbos!
(laughing)
I would say my advice to you would be to let Fiona live in her own relationship.
You can't do it for her.
There's things you should know.
Well, sometimes, sweetie, when people are in love, they don't tell someone everything for a reason.
That's like lying.
No, sweetie, it's just...
it's a little editing.
Now the sifting.
See?
We separate and aerate those flour particles to make them absorb liquids better.
Someone should sift my dad.
(chuckles)
Oh, you Gallaghers.
You're all so funny.
KEVIN:
Frank!
This is bullshit, Frank!
FRANK:
Bar the door!
Lock the door!
What is happening?
!
It's okay, Sheila.
It's just my dad.
I thought we lost 'em.
Did you even have a plan back there?
I was going to charm her into signing once she was there.
How the hell was I supposed to know she would show up with ghetto Godzilla in a Peterbilt.
I am seriously this close to punching you in the dick.
(truck approaching)
Get...
They're just girls.
Stop.
You talk to them.
I need the key to the back door.
That is not a sexual euphemism.
I need the fucking key.
What did you do with it?
I-I-I don't know.
I can't think when you yell, Frank.
I'm not yelling.
What'd you do with the key?
You're still yelling.
I need the key, Sheila.
Okay, okay, it's by the...
it's by the... it's by the washing machine.
It's not by the washing machine.
Yes, it is.
I put it by the washing machine.
It's not by the...
Mom.
It-it's Mom.
Debbie.
Oh, my sweet pea.
What the fuck are you looking at?
!
Hey, look, I got nothing to do with it, all right?
I'm just the driver.
Sit.
Sit your ass down.
Oh...
That was a nasty trick.
Even for you, Frank.
I had my heart set on that teddy bear.
Oh, poor Monica.
Well, what about your kids?
!
Remember?
The six kids?
Youngest was only two months old before you ran off.
Ended up with...
fucking Shrek here.
You want me to step in here, Monica?
No, I didn't leave you, Frank.
Yes, you did.
I didn't choose to leave my family.
You almost destroyed me.
When I turned up at Roberta's that night,
I was an...
BOTH:
Emotional cripple!
Oh, bullshit.
With not one ounce of self-respect.
You almost destroyed me.
I'm gonna start crying.
You drove me into the ground, Frank.
You-you robbed me of any sense of dignity
I ever had, and...
Where's the rest of the kids?
They're out playing.
They live down at Fiona's.
You mind putting some bags on?
Can you... can you put some bags on your feet?
Bags on my feet?
Take your shoes off.
SHEILA:
I need you to put bags on.
Don't, don't don't.
Hell hath no fury like popcorn burned.
Is Steve coming?
Hope so.
Are you guys going to make a baby while we watch Cosmos?
'Cause that's going to make me throw up.
Billions and billions of sperm.
Ew!
Steve, please turn it on already.
Yeah, hurry up.
I gotta get back to work.
Ooh!
Cool.
Hey.
And what our faith may be.
Missed you, stranger.
You, too.
Get a room.
Get your tickets?
LIPS:
Oh, yeah.
Thanks.
Glad I could help.
Glad you're glad.
Steve.
And birds...
Oh, this popcorn's burnt.
Our microwave sucks.
That doesn't mean I want you to buy us a new one.
The universe is smaller than atoms.
But it's also the story of our own planet.
Debs?
Honey, what happened?
LIP:
What, Dad have one too many again?
You just got to ignore him when he's like that, Debs.
Why do you always blame Dad first?
Who else is there?
She's over at Sheila's.
Who?
Monica.
Relationships of the awesome machinery of nature.
Who the hell is Monica?
Her mother.
On this shore, we've learned...
FIONA:
Debs.
What do you care?
!
You'll be living with Steve in that house he bought next door!
Some part of our being knows...
Surprise.
Because the cosmos is also within us.
We're made of star stuff.
I'm going to work.
Ian, come on, wait.
Mommy!
Mommy!
I know.
Mommy!
Mommy!
Worlds of ice and stars of diamonds.
Atoms and masses...
What the fuck?
I need to see you.
Not a good time.
MAN:
Who keeps hanging their fucking laundry on my pull-up bar?
!
I-I-I don't know where else to go.
I thought you were working today.
Uh, Linda's gonna have my ass.
I'm supposed to be there now.
I'll meet you there in 20.
Oh, bullshit!
You physically abused me.
What?
!
When?
!
The Fourth of July.
Oh, come on, you hit me in the face with a tray of apple pan dowdy.
And you hit me back.
Yeah, after you broke my nose and scratched my cornea.
Oh, yeah?
What about this?
Oh, come on, you started that one.
And I'll finish it if you lay a finger on her.
SHEILA:
Roberta...
Bob.
Only Moni called me Roberta.
All right, well Bob, we're just in the way here and we should make our exit and leave Monica for her apologies.
Apologies?
For walking out on this piece of shit?
No, for walking out on them.
Oh, my God.
It's all right.
I'm not one of yours.
Just came to rubberneck.
Alhamdu lillah!
Ian, I did it.
Linda's pregnant.
Ian.
Finally knocked her up.
Where are you?
I did it.
It's over.
What the fuck?
!
Sign the name!
Sign the name!
MONICA:
You're all so big.
I missed you so much.
Well, why didn't you take us with you?
MONICA:
Because...
I knew you'd be fine with Fiona.
Fucking right you keep your mouth shut.
You better keep it shut.
You hear me?
Put the candy back, Mickey.
Mm.
That's sweet.
I like 'em sweet.
But then, uh... so do you, huh?
(laughing):
Huh?
Put it back.
Now.
Fuck!
Kash, what are you doing?
It's a fucking Snickers bar!
Fuck!
IAN:
Holy shit!
MICKEY:
Jesus Chr...!
You okay?
Fuck!
Hey, hey, listen to me.
You fuckin' suck!
Thought you were at work.
There was a shooting.
Mickey and Kash.
Holy shit, Mickey shot Kash?
Kash shot Mickey.
What?
In the leg.
He's fine.
I just wanted to get out of there before the cops got there.
What'd I miss with Mom?
Well, you know how Dad's a total fucking asshole?
Yeah.
Turns out he's the good one.
Oh, I can't believe you sucked me back in here for money!
I did no such thing.
But since you're in town, why don't you sign up for this little thing and I will cut you in...
Oh, fuck you, Frank!
Wait, you brought her back here?
Oh, Ian.
Wait, you knew where she was the whole time?
Okay, look, this little reunion was bound to happen sooner or later anyway.
We were thinking about coming around to talk to you about something else.
No, no...
Yes, now.
Yes, now.
Moni and I want to take Liam to live with us.
What?
!
Over my dead body.
How about Moni sign whatever the hell it is you need... we get Liam.
Done.
No fucking way!
You can't have Liam.
Why the hell not?
He's not even Frank's.
Fact is,
Liam is black.
All you white folks scooping up black babies like fashion accessories have a rude awakening coming.
There will be a backlash if people don't stop underestimating the cultural importance of a black parent raising a black baby.
Liam needs me and he's coming with us.
Out of the fucking question, Roberta.
Roberta and I want to start a family of our own.
Well, how about you finish this one first.
(sobbing):
They're taking Liam?
No!
Yes!
No, nobody's taking anyone anywhere.
You don't get to abandon your kids and then show up one day to take your pick of the litter.
Oh, now that's not fair.
Your mother's made mistakes, but she's here now.
That's got to count for something.
FIONA:
Shut up, Frank!
This isn't about you.
This is about you.
This is about what you didn't do.
It's about what I did.
And you know what?
I did a fucking great job.
Debbie is class president.
She's on the debate team, going to nationals.
And Lip, he's top of his class.
He set the curve.
Ian was promoted in ROTC and he tested out of English.
And Carl made something blow up for his science fair.
And you know what, they did it all, no thanks to you!
Because you weren't here!
And I appreciate that, Fiona.
But I'm here now.
And Liam belongs with me.
He doesn't even know who you are.
I'm his mother!
You were my mother, too!
LIAM:
I don't!
I don't know!
MONICA:
Maybe I'll never be able to make things right with you... but there's still time with Liam.
And Debbie and Carl,
I am so sorry if I hurt you.
See, I love you so much.
Please let me be your mommy again.
Please?
(gasps)
You know what?
You're right.
You are their mother.
And you're here now.
(sniffs) So I'm done.
I'm done with the school and the bills and the clinics.
I'm done.
They're all yours now, Mom.
Good luck.
(speaking quietly)

You have to be quick, is all.
I took a busload of pills.
Time to leave!
Hi, Betty.
Can I buy you a drink?
Michelle know you're here?
What would Michelle care?
Stanley, what do you think of my tits?
What?
Stanley?
Yeah?
How long are we gonna keep pretending we're having sex?
Tell me more about this "good place" you're in.
The good?
On the phone you said you were in a good place.
Right... right... oh, yes.
Um, I've got some new stuff going on, you know...
New interests.
I got some new friends.
That's nice to hear.
I think I might be happy.
Happy?
Happier.
This only works if you're honest with me, right?
Right.
Right.
Because it seems to me that you're exhibiting symptoms of depression, low self-worth, anxiety...
Those are all different things, right?
Can I have one of those bananas?
Let me tell you something, Cadie, woman to woman.
You're 17.
You're beautiful.
This is the best time of your life.
My vagina has the look and feel of Turkey jerky.
I would do anything to be 17 again.
You would?
Please, you don't need a doctor to tell you to go and have fun.
What would your mother say?
She'd say I need more drugs.
Hey, Cadie.
Assessment?
Looks great, dad.
Very dynamic.
You think so?
Yeah, it's really suffering, you know?
Awesome.
I don't think it looks scared enough.
I saw Dr. Moore today.
Oh yeah?
Good?
Yeah, it was good.
He fix you?
He's a she.
She fix you?
Yeah, she fixed me good.
Cool.
Do you like my birds?
Took 'em a while to dry out...
Check out the entry wounds...
I can't see any.
Really?
Huh.
Yup.
On television again...
I'm back!
"Pageant rematch" they're calling it...
Hell, I was pageant perfection back in the day, and damn it, I am still perfect.
My nipples still point at the wall.
Yes, you can tell.
Yeah, well, the whole family's gotta...
Well, Cadie's going to behave...
Look, she's a little bit kooky, and little bit flat-chested but...
They are going to think she's beautiful.
Yes... they made that show, "lesbian dorm."
And what was the other one called?
"DNA disaster" with the midgets.
I love that!
Oh, Cadie...
It's beginning to look like a madhouse in here.
So, how was the doctor?
It was good.
But she said I should spend more time with my friends...
I'm so happy to hear that.
Listen, Cadie,
I'm meeting with a couple of tv producers tomorrow.
Oh.
It's a reunion show.
"Pageant rematch."
"Are they still stacked?" Cute huh?
It's catchy.
Obviously there's a lot of interest in me, since I actually won every pageant I entered.
But, all the gals will be there.
Except for the girl from Bluewater.
Shame about that speedboat.
Anyway, the executives are coming, and I'd like you to meet them.
Okay.
Good.
And Cadie, please, remember your medication.
Maybe take a little extra.
I just want you as good and happy and stable as possible, okay?
Sure, mom.
But I wanted to tell you about...
Hello?
Hi!
Yes... yes, yes!
Of course I still have my oboe!
I was just practicing.
Inching towards me, and I wonder if he's dead.
Because the last thing you need is to come face to face with a cornered, angry beaver.
And I reach down, and it looks dead, right?
So, I go to prod it with my gun...
Sorry.
Hi Stanley...
Hey, Cadie.
How's it going?
Good, I guess.
Wow.
Okay.
So, hey, um, Michelle's mom just got this new hot tub.
I was wondering if you wanted to go to a party over there.
With you?
Uh, sure.
I'll be there, and if you go, you'll be there, so sure, we'll be there together.
Is this our date?
Huh?
You said we should have a date.
Was it I that...?
Hell, why not?
It's a date.
My day is great now.
It got promoted.
Stop flirting!
Get to the point!
Uh... that's cool...
Ask her, man!
Ask her!
Ask her now, man!
Do you think you could bring some of your pills?
Pills?
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
- Shut up!
- Come on!
Stan!
Yeah, we always have such fun... with the pills.
What kind do you want?
There's a choice?
Blue!
Whatever you can get, I mean,
- anything really...
- Um... blue?
Blue pills.
I can do that.
Sounds great.
Um, all right, I'll see you later.
So, in order to defeat obsessive-compulsive disorder we constantly have to confront our fears head on.
Every minute of every day.
You can't lock and unlock your door six times before you leave the house.
Just leave.
You can't wash your hands over and over again.
Just leave 'em dirty.
And if you think you're gonna pee your pants unless you say the word "zombie" five times, just do it.
It's that simple and that hard.
Cadie, are you listening to me?
Okay.
Let's do this.
The birds.
Why don't you take me through your feelings?
Pigeons.
They travel in flocks and you never know what they're going to do.
And they're filthy and full of disease.
And they're not scared of me.
They look at me.
Well, that's all true.
But Cadie that's why we took you to that park where all those elderly people...
They were...
Feeding the pigeons.
Yes.
I remember.
Thousands of them, fluttering and flapping.
Peck, peck, peck...
Peck, peck.
Yes, that's right.
Now, confront that thought.
Defeat it.
Yes.
They're not looking at me...
Yes!
Yes.
They're looking at the bread crumbs and the old people.
Yes!
And I can leave at any time.
And they can't hurt me.
It's not working, davina.
I'm having obsessive thoughts.
Come on, tell me, Cadie.
What are they?
Tell me.
Tell me now!
I wanna stab you.
I think I'm gonna write you another prescription.
And maybe some of the blue pills.
Pretty big order...
I'm going traveling...
Hey, kid.
Hey, kid!
I got something for you to try.
Okay...
Think you might really like it.
One's not going to hurt you.
I said okay.
Charlotte!
Last time.
Quit dealing drugs in the pharmacy!
Later, Marty.
You are so getting sugar pills next time, dope tits!
Placebo!
Hey, you know those meds that mellow out night terrors but sometimes can make you try to drive your car in your sleep?
Yeah, I think I have some of those.
Want to trade?
I got real heavy epilepsy meds.
It's like taking a bullet to the brain.
Cool.
How'd you get them?
Oh, you know...
That's pretty good.
Whoa, they're purple.
Last time I took those,
I thought I was popping study pills.
Woke up two days later in the showroom of a mattress discounter.
You riding home?
No.
I'm flying home.
Later.
Hi dad.
Ahh!
Cadie!
You, uh... startled me.
Where's that thing...
The doctor said I should spend more time with you.
Really?
Which doctor?
They're all properly qualified medical practitioners, dad.
Right...
Okay...
Well, I gotta get going now.
Well, maybe I could go hunting with you today?
Look Cadie, when I'm out there, it's my time.
I get my time...
Well, they said I'm in need of guidance.
Great need.
Dad?
Dad!
What?
!
Mom says we're going to be on television.
Yeah.
Dad?
Stop talking!
You're scaring everything away!
Dad?
So your father's dead.
Yes.
Do you mind telling me how that happened?
I guess I can.
It's kind of a crazy story.
That's okay.
Well, my parents met at the circus.
My dad was one of those trainers who taught bears to ride unicycles, and my mom was the second fattest woman in the world.
One day, they were, you know, fooling around by the trapeze, and I guess my mom was crushing my dad, and he fell, and an elephant ended up, you know, stepping...
Right on his head.
Smashed his skull like a melon.
My mom says that was the day I was conceived.
Cadie...
I'm not so sure that's true.
But she's slimmed down now.
She's probably like the 4th or 5th fattest woman in the world.
Cadie.
So she looks better, but I still can't really get my arms around her.
Of course.
And what about friends?
- I have some.
- And a boyfriend.
Does he make you happy?
Yes.
You take a lot of drugs, don't you, Cadie?
Yes, but I don't think they're working.
I think I might need some more.
Stronger ones.
Can I ask you something?
Yeah?
Have you ever tried not taking drugs.
What?
The drugs.
Have you tried not taking them?
Get outta here.
Everyone is going to disappoint you, Cadie.
They won't mean to, but they will.
Drugs won't change that.
Cadie!
Still fits!
Now you should probably cover up tomorrow, but I'm thinking it'll really wow those pageant rematch producers if I show them a little skin.
Mom, that's great.
You look amazing.
Cadie.
You spoke to me.
That is so nice.
Mom.
How do you know if something is real?
You can feel it.
What like, inside?
Cadie, don't be batty.
Emotions aren't real.
Look, I'll show you.
Put your hand on my side there.
You feel that?
Those are ribs.
That's real.
I'm 41 and there's not an ounce of fat on me.
Here.
You never wear the stuff I buy you.
And I know pretty.
Put this on tomorrow for the television people.
It'll help with the breasts.
And smile, remember?
Smile like you're pretty.
Look up if you like me...
Hey!
How's it going?
It's okay.
Oh yeah, that's right!
Drink up, you losers!
Michelle's mom keeps giving us margaritas.
She's friendly.
Oh, yeah.
Gettin' friendlier by the minute.
Did you bring the, um...
Oh, right!
Hey, Cadie!
Hey, I brought you all this...
Like you said, Stan...
No, no, no, no, no!
Not now!
Oh.
Sorry...
That's a lot of drugs there, Cadie.
You got everything?
Kinda.
You have any mood enhancers?
What kind of mood you looking for?
Bedroom mood...
Stan here says you're a real hellcat in the sack, and I think 'Chelle could really use a boost, chemically.
Don't be such a dick.
Michelle!
- Hi, mom.
- Takin' it easy, right?
I am taking it easy!
Don't we throw good parties?
Who's this?
Mom, this is Cadie.
Cadie, this is mom and that's Jimmy, her...
- Just Jimmy.
- Hi.
- Hello!
Hi!
Jimmy look!
- Cadie...
Do you guys need drinks?
Actually no, Jillian.
Thanks, but we're supplied.
Well, that's totally hunky dory!
But thank you, though.
No problem at all.
Come on, 'Chelle.
Aren't you lovely?
Look at her, Jimmy.
Isn't she just a beautiful young lady?
Yeah, she's lovely.
Gorgeous.
Mm-hmm.
Let's do it!
Blues!
I'm in heaven.
I'll take those.
Here you go, nips.
There any footballs?
You are the coolest, Cadie.
Yeah, Cadie, you are!
You guys are idiotic.
Yeah.
We're gonna be much better than that any minute now.
You know guys?
Hello!
Where are all the party people?
Shit, guys, move it!
Move it.
Let's go!
Hurry up.
Hurry.
Hurry.
Come on.
Come on.
Your mom's gonna kill me.
Hurry up.
I love my life!
Hey Tony.
Tony.
Oh, hey.
Did you see Stanley?
We're supposed to be on a date.
I don't know.
I guess he...
I don't know.
Hey, Cadie, those blue pills, what do they do?
Intensify emotion.
Yeah.
I guess that's right.
Intensify.
Yo, 'Bbud.
Did you just fart in there?
- Eww!
- Eww!
No, man!
And dude, this is a hot tub.
With the jets, it's actually impossible to tell who, if anyone, has actually farted.
That's the beauty of the thing.
- You so farted, man!
- No!
I can't swim!
'Chelly.
Don't love him.
Love me.
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!
Ah, geez, Michelle.
Well, hello, sir.
'Bbud, Jamie.
Oh, hey.
Abbud.
Sorry.
I'm, like, orbiting.
Don't bother.
Jamie doesn't interface with men.
Really?
Not even gay dudes?
I mean, I'm not gay.
I just really like to know about people.
I'm gay curious.
Tell him that's even worse.
She says that's even worse.
Huh.
That's really interesting, and we could talk about that because I totally, totally, totally "get" lesbians.
I'm "Tenderfist 69."
This party is so hetero-normative.
And your friends are just, like, totally gender-coercive.
See you around.
Thanks, 'Bbud.
Hetero-normative?
You got to be kidding me.
You've got to be kidding!
Ah!
Now you're getting, like, totally gender-coercive, tea.
I love it.
Oh, wow.
Listen to that.
I love this song!
Mom, go back inside.
Mom, mom, mom!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Show some skin!
No, no, no, no, no!
So embarrassing!
I want to dance!
Mom, stop it!
Mom!
Want some?
Okay.
You're Tony's sister, right?
You don't speak, do you?
That's okay.
I did that for four months.
It's cool.
But you do know they're going to put you in a clinic, right?
Are you crazy, too?
I've decided not to be crazy.
I stopped taking drugs for my boyfriend.
Woo!
Hey, Cadie-shack.
Hey, totally weird Tony sister.
You having fun?
Not really.
Stan is...
It's not going too well.
It'd probably help if you got out of that dress.
What?
Look, he obviously likes the goods since he keeps coming back for more.
Huh?
You know, all the...
You're having.
Oh, right, that, yeah.
Sex.
Yeah.
Just take your top off.
Thanks for the drugs, girl.
It's all going down.
This looks like fun.
You don't mind if an old guy gets in here, do you?
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah, yeah.
Oh, that's better.
Coming over!
Oh, check it out.
I got inflated.
I think I should go.
Whoa, hey, look, look, hey.
Where you going, beautiful?
Let's just talk.
There's something you should know, Cadie.
Boys your age, they don't know what the hell they're doing.
A girl like you, you're kind of like that caterpillar up there, waiting to blossom.
That's not a cocoon.
It's...
Oh!
Come on.
You're so serious.
Hey, hey!
Stan, look, I like you.
I'm asleep.
Yeah, yeah.
You're nice to talk to, you know, to a point.
But I don't appreciate you beating off on my Teddy, okay?
Stan, don't you have your own girlfriend to worry about?
Girlfriend?
Oh, you mean Cadie.
Yes, Cadie.
Who you bone every night, according to Tony.
Oh, geez.
'Chelly, can you sit down?
No, Stan.
You jizzed in my bed.
Look, just sit down.
I have something to tell you.
It's a secret, okay?
I need to tell you about Cadie.
Forget about Michelle.
She's not part of this.
I don't even know why you followed me in here.
You felt something.
Don't tell me you didn't.
I felt something, okay?
But that doesn't...
Tea, listen to me.
You want this too.
I know you do.
Just go away.
I mean it, Ton'.
Go away.
I'm not walking away, 'cause this is different.
No.
It's real.
And you know it too.
Why don't you just give something a chance for once in your life?
Go away.
Okay, be lonely.
Hey, Cades.
How are you?
Where's Stan?
Tony, were you doing something bad?
It's just, every time I see you, you're doing something bad.
Relax, Cades.
It's a party.
You can't keep doing just whatever you want, you know.
Things can't always work out for you.
Listen, Cadie, you let me worry about me, all right?
You focus on your own problems.
You've got enough.
Maybe start with that boyfriend of yours.
Did you hear all that?
It's none of my business, tea.
Right, yeah.
I haven't been good in lots of ways.
I'm really sorry.
What for?
That Stan invited you here for your drugs.
It was really shitty.
Stanley should treat you better than that.
We should all be better.
Oh, wow.
Look who's here?
Are you...
I wanted to be by myself.
Oh, okay, sure.
Look, I'm glad you're still here.
I hope I didn't do anything to offend you before, nothing that we need to tell Jillian about, certainly, just some old-fashioned chaperone-to-chaperone-y banter, huh?
Want to get high?
Yeah.
You girls are just so much fun.
We can be, if you treat us right.
Okay.
I just take it?
Oh, God.
You're just so care-free, no responsibilities.
You're just so...
Perky.
I love that, love it.
Hey 'Chelly, where's your mom?
I have no clue.
Crashed somewhere as usual, I expect.
Stan, where are you going?
Shit!
Cadie.
What the (Bleep) are you doing?
Having some fun.
Well, it's been great seeing you kids.
I hope we can keep quiet about the drugs you've all been doing.
Jesus.
Not everything is about you, Stan.
So, now you think getting groped by some perv is fun?
Yeah!
I'm fun!
I'm a whole lot of fun!
But what do you care?
I don't know!
This...
This isn't fun.
This is crazy.
This is all just completely insane!
You just lose it.
How can anyone respect that?
Leave me alone.
You always just lose it.
You don't know.
And I care when you lose it!
You don't know anything.
I care.
Go away!
Go away!
Cadie!
Cadie!
They're here.
The television executives came early.
What the...
What are you...
This is completely insane.
There are people downstairs waiting to meet you.
Myself and your father are ready, organized, happy.
And look at you!
You look terrible.
This is the one thing I ask of you.
What did I tell you about staying on your meds?
Don't you want to be happy?
Mom, there's too many birds out there.
I can't stand it.
For God's sakes, Cadie, take your medication.
Now!
And don't even think about coming down there unless you are stable!
See?
I'm happy.
You wanna do it now?
You have to be quick, is all.
I took a busload of pills.
Time to leave!
Hi, Betty.
Can I buy you a drink?
Michelle know you're here?
What would Michelle care?
Stanley, what do you think of my tits?
What?
Stanley?
Yeah?
How long are we gonna keep pretending we're having sex?
Tell me more about this "good place" you're in.
The good?
On the phone you said you were in a good place.
Right... right... oh, yes.
Um, I've got some new stuff going on, you know...
New interests.
I got some new friends.
That's nice to hear.
I think I might be happy.
Happy?
Happier.
This only works if you're honest with me, right?
Right.
Right.
Because it seems to me that you're exhibiting symptoms of depression, low self-worth, anxiety...
Those are all different things, right?
Can I have one of those bananas?
Let me tell you something, Cadie, woman to woman.
You're 17.
You're beautiful.
This is the best time of your life.
My vagina has the look and feel of Turkey jerky.
I would do anything to be 17 again.
You would?
Please, you don't need a doctor to tell you to go and have fun.
What would your mother say?
She'd say I need more drugs.
Hey, Cadie.
Assessment?
Looks great, dad.
Very dynamic.
You think so?
Yeah, it's really suffering, you know?
Awesome.
I don't think it looks scared enough.
I saw Dr. Moore today.
Oh yeah?
Good?
Yeah, it was good.
He fix you?
He's a she.
She fix you?
Yeah, she fixed me good.
Cool.
Do you like my birds?
Took 'em a while to dry out...
Check out the entry wounds...
I can't see any.
Really?
Huh.
Yup.
On television again...
I'm back!
"Pageant rematch" they're calling it...
Hell, I was pageant perfection back in the day, and damn it, I am still perfect.
My nipples still point at the wall.
Yes, you can tell.
Yeah, well, the whole family's gotta...
Well, Cadie's going to behave...
Look, she's a little bit kooky, and little bit flat-chested but...
They are going to think she's beautiful.
Yes... they made that show, "lesbian dorm."
And what was the other one called?
"DNA disaster" with the midgets.
I love that!
Oh, Cadie...
It's beginning to look like a madhouse in here.
So, how was the doctor?
It was good.
But she said I should spend more time with my friends...
I'm so happy to hear that.
Listen, Cadie,
I'm meeting with a couple of tv producers tomorrow.
Oh.
It's a reunion show.
"Pageant rematch."
"Are they still stacked?" Cute huh?
It's catchy.
Obviously there's a lot of interest in me, since I actually won every pageant I entered.
But, all the gals will be there.
Except for the girl from Bluewater.
Shame about that speedboat.
Anyway, the executives are coming, and I'd like you to meet them.
Okay.
Good.
And Cadie, please, remember your medication.
Maybe take a little extra.
I just want you as good and happy and stable as possible, okay?
Sure, mom.
But I wanted to tell you about...
Hello?
Hi!
Yes... yes, yes!
Of course I still have my oboe!
I was just practicing.
Inching towards me, and I wonder if he's dead.
Because the last thing you need is to come face to face with a cornered, angry beaver.
And I reach down, and it looks dead, right?
So, I go to prod it with my gun...
Sorry.
Hi Stanley...
Hey, Cadie.
How's it going?
Good, I guess.
Wow.
Okay.
So, hey, um, Michelle's mom just got this new hot tub.
I was wondering if you wanted to go to a party over there.
With you?
Uh, sure.
I'll be there, and if you go, you'll be there, so sure, we'll be there together.
Is this our date?
Huh?
You said we should have a date.
Was it I that...?
Hell, why not?
It's a date.
My day is great now.
It got promoted.
Stop flirting!
Get to the point!
Uh... that's cool...
Ask her, man!
Ask her!
Ask her now, man!
Do you think you could bring some of your pills?
Pills?
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
- Shut up!
- Come on!
Stan!
Yeah, we always have such fun... with the pills.
What kind do you want?
There's a choice?
Blue!
Whatever you can get, I mean,
- anything really...
- Um... blue?
Blue pills.
I can do that.
Sounds great.
Um, all right, I'll see you later.
So, in order to defeat obsessive-compulsive disorder we constantly have to confront our fears head on.
Every minute of every day.
You can't lock and unlock your door six times before you leave the house.
Just leave.
You can't wash your hands over and over again.
Just leave 'em dirty.
And if you think you're gonna pee your pants unless you say the word "zombie" five times, just do it.
It's that simple and that hard.
Cadie, are you listening to me?
Okay.
Let's do this.
The birds.
Why don't you take me through your feelings?
Pigeons.
They travel in flocks and you never know what they're going to do.
And they're filthy and full of disease.
And they're not scared of me.
They look at me.
Well, that's all true.
But Cadie that's why we took you to that park where all those elderly people...
They were...
Feeding the pigeons.
Yes.
I remember.
Thousands of them, fluttering and flapping.
Peck, peck, peck...
Peck, peck.
Yes, that's right.
Now, confront that thought.
Defeat it.
Yes.
They're not looking at me...
Yes!
Yes.
They're looking at the bread crumbs and the old people.
Yes!
And I can leave at any time.
And they can't hurt me.
It's not working, davina.
I'm having obsessive thoughts.
Come on, tell me, Cadie.
What are they?
Tell me.
Tell me now!
I wanna stab you.
I think I'm gonna write you another prescription.
And maybe some of the blue pills.
Pretty big order...
I'm going traveling...
Hey, kid.
Hey, kid!
I got something for you to try.
Okay...
Think you might really like it.
One's not going to hurt you.
I said okay.
Charlotte!
Last time.
Quit dealing drugs in the pharmacy!
Later, Marty.
You are so getting sugar pills next time, dope tits!
Placebo!
Hey, you know those meds that mellow out night terrors but sometimes can make you try to drive your car in your sleep?
Yeah, I think I have some of those.
Want to trade?
I got real heavy epilepsy meds.
It's like taking a bullet to the brain.
Cool.
How'd you get them?
Oh, you know...
That's pretty good.
Whoa, they're purple.
Last time I took those,
I thought I was popping study pills.
Woke up two days later in the showroom of a mattress discounter.
You riding home?
No.
I'm flying home.
Later.
Hi dad.
Ahh!
Cadie!
You, uh... startled me.
Where's that thing...
The doctor said I should spend more time with you.
Really?
Which doctor?
They're all properly qualified medical practitioners, dad.
Right...
Okay...
Well, I gotta get going now.
Well, maybe I could go hunting with you today?
Look Cadie, when I'm out there, it's my time.
I get my time...
Well, they said I'm in need of guidance.
Great need.
Dad?
Dad!
What?
!
Mom says we're going to be on television.
Yeah.
Dad?
Stop talking!
You're scaring everything away!
Dad?
So your father's dead.
Yes.
Do you mind telling me how that happened?
I guess I can.
It's kind of a crazy story.
That's okay.
Well, my parents met at the circus.
My dad was one of those trainers who taught bears to ride unicycles, and my mom was the second fattest woman in the world.
One day, they were, you know, fooling around by the trapeze, and I guess my mom was crushing my dad, and he fell, and an elephant ended up, you know, stepping...
Right on his head.
Smashed his skull like a melon.
My mom says that was the day I was conceived.
Cadie...
I'm not so sure that's true.
But she's slimmed down now.
She's probably like the 4th or 5th fattest woman in the world.
Cadie.
So she looks better, but I still can't really get my arms around her.
Of course.
And what about friends?
- I have some.
- And a boyfriend.
Does he make you happy?
Yes.
You take a lot of drugs, don't you, Cadie?
Yes, but I don't think they're working.
I think I might need some more.
Stronger ones.
Can I ask you something?
Yeah?
Have you ever tried not taking drugs.
What?
The drugs.
Have you tried not taking them?
Get outta here.
Everyone is going to disappoint you, Cadie.
They won't mean to, but they will.
Drugs won't change that.
Cadie!
Still fits!
Now you should probably cover up tomorrow, but I'm thinking it'll really wow those pageant rematch producers if I show them a little skin.
Mom, that's great.
You look amazing.
Cadie.
You spoke to me.
That is so nice.
Mom.
How do you know if something is real?
You can feel it.
What like, inside?
Cadie, don't be batty.
Emotions aren't real.
Look, I'll show you.
Put your hand on my side there.
You feel that?
Those are ribs.
That's real.
I'm 41 and there's not an ounce of fat on me.
Here.
You never wear the stuff I buy you.
And I know pretty.
Put this on tomorrow for the television people.
It'll help with the breasts.
And smile, remember?
Smile like you're pretty.
Look up if you like me...
Hey!
How's it going?
It's okay.
Oh yeah, that's right!
Drink up, you losers!
Michelle's mom keeps giving us margaritas.
She's friendly.
Oh, yeah.
Gettin' friendlier by the minute.
Did you bring the, um...
Oh, right!
Hey, Cadie!
Hey, I brought you all this...
Like you said, Stan...
No, no, no, no, no!
Not now!
Oh.
Sorry...
That's a lot of drugs there, Cadie.
You got everything?
Kinda.
You have any mood enhancers?
What kind of mood you looking for?
Bedroom mood...
Stan here says you're a real hellcat in the sack, and I think 'Chelle could really use a boost, chemically.
Don't be such a dick.
Michelle!
- Hi, mom.
- Takin' it easy, right?
I am taking it easy!
Don't we throw good parties?
Who's this?
Mom, this is Cadie.
Cadie, this is mom and that's Jimmy, her...
- Just Jimmy.
- Hi.
- Hello!
Hi!
Jimmy look!
- Cadie...
Do you guys need drinks?
Actually no, Jillian.
Thanks, but we're supplied.
Well, that's totally hunky dory!
But thank you, though.
No problem at all.
Come on, 'Chelle.
Aren't you lovely?
Look at her, Jimmy.
Isn't she just a beautiful young lady?
Yeah, she's lovely.
Gorgeous.
Mm-hmm.
Let's do it!
Blues!
I'm in heaven.
I'll take those.
Here you go, nips.
There any footballs?
You are the coolest, Cadie.
Yeah, Cadie, you are!
You guys are idiotic.
Yeah.
We're gonna be much better than that any minute now.
You know guys?
Hello!
Where are all the party people?
Shit, guys, move it!
Move it.
Let's go!
Hurry up.
Hurry.
Hurry.
Come on.
Come on.
Your mom's gonna kill me.
Hurry up.
I love my life!
Hey Tony.
Tony.
Oh, hey.
Did you see Stanley?
We're supposed to be on a date.
I don't know.
I guess he...
I don't know.
Hey, Cadie, those blue pills, what do they do?
Intensify emotion.
Yeah.
I guess that's right.
Intensify.
Yo, 'Bbud.
Did you just fart in there?
- Eww!
- Eww!
No, man!
And dude, this is a hot tub.
With the jets, it's actually impossible to tell who, if anyone, has actually farted.
That's the beauty of the thing.
- You so farted, man!
- No!
I can't swim!
'Chelly.
Don't love him.
Love me.
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!
Ah, geez, Michelle.
Well, hello, sir.
'Bbud, Jamie.
Oh, hey.
Abbud.
Sorry.
I'm, like, orbiting.
Don't bother.
Jamie doesn't interface with men.
Really?
Not even gay dudes?
I mean, I'm not gay.
I just really like to know about people.
I'm gay curious.
Tell him that's even worse.

Hetero-normative?
You got to be kidding me.
You've got to be kidding!
Ah!
Now you're getting, like, totally gender-coercive, tea.
I love it.
Oh, wow.
Listen to that.
I love this song!
Mom, go back inside.
Mom, mom, mom!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Show some skin!

So embarrassing!

And don't even think about coming down there unless you are stable!
See?
I'm happy.
This programme contains very strong language, drug use and scenes of a sexual nature.
You're beautiful.
No, I'm not.
I'm a no good shit magnet.
Get fucked, burn it to the ground, dance on the embers then get on your coach.
Are we still friends?
I was hoping more than that.
Liv, whatever he's told you, don't believe him, he's a psycho.
Stay away from her.
Stay away from her.
Why do you care?
They're brothers.
I hope you die puking on your kidneys.
Bitch.
I need to come back.
Please talk to Dad for me.
Epic move, boys.
Rider, that switch, genius.
You too, skip.
That's what it's about... movement, commitment - we'll kill these bastards with that shit.
Nice work, boys.
Nice work.
Nick, spot-on, ja.
Now, get cleaned up.
Last one in the showers is a homo!
I'm a man who fought for my beliefs, ja?
Fought for my people.
Fought for the brotherhood of a nation,the rainbow nation.
And through togetherness and respect for each other, we defeated the greatest injustice in the world - apartheid.
Er, what is apartheid?
The fact is success in life is only as important as the people you share it with, hm?
This is your family, this team.
And if you can stand up for each other out on that pitch, you can do anything.
Nick...
This Friday, there are gonna be 30 men on that pitch.
15 of them are gonna be winners.
15 of them are gonna be bitches.
Which d'you want to be?
Winners!
Damn right.
Cos this is a team of winners.
We're not gonna allow ourselves to fail, cos failure's a giant bitch with sharp claws.
We're gonna gang-rape failure.
We're gonna hold it down and we're gonna...
Nick, I think you've taken that metaphor far enough, ja.
Aye aye, coach.
But you get the point.
We're gonna smash it - right, boys?
Fuck, yes!
Fuck, yes, indeed.
You're crying, Warren.
She left you because you're a crying man.
Nobody loves a crying man.
Feel that pain in your chest, Warren.
It's not stress.
It's not cholesterol either.
It's breasts...
budding where your pecs should be.
Instead of man-armour, you're growing tits, Warren.
Tits!
It's no wonder she's fucking around.
Now, put down the pills, grow a pair and stand up for yourself.
Suicide is for quitters, Warren.
Listen to your life coach.
Peace out.
What's this?
It's a set of rules.
A contract.
It's...
I'm not taking any chances this time.
"No girls in the bedroom.
"I shall not use my father's sporting equipment"...?
Yeah, that last one especially.
Not having you go batshit on us again.
Right, Nick?
Right.
"I will complete my education."
I was thinking of getting a job, actually - something that lets me do my music.
Drug music.
Where's the money in that?
There isn't.
That's why I need a job.
You'll finish your education, that's what you'll do.
Don't I get a choice?
Oh, yes, Matthew, you've got a choice.
You can stay here, obey my rules and behave.
Or you can fuck off!
How does that sound?
It sounds good to me!
The Levan boys, back together!
Cheers, guys.
See that, Matty?
That's "can do" attitude.
Yeah?
Now, you follow those rules, do as I say, you could be just like Nick.
Well, we all need a role model, right?
Was that sarcasm?
Dad, chillax.
Look at his face - it's super sincere.
It better be.
Sign it.
Nick, witness.
Good.
Right, I've got to go.
Warren's threatening to overdose again, and I need to take him for a game of golf, try out my new driver.
Callaway.
Big Bertha.
Hollow head.
Tasty.
Thwack!
In the hole!
I've got a meeting with your principal this morning.
Don't be late.
Nick, a word.
Listen, if he starts any of his mind games...
Yeah, phase that shit right out.
...just remember you're better than him.
Laters.
Yeah.
Got a minute?
Course.
Man, I'm so psyched for this game on Friday.
It's gonna be epic.
You coming?
Yeah.
Course.
Will Dad be there?
Yeah.
I mean, I hope so, but he's really busy, so... yeah.
Listen, mate,
I just wanted you to know something.
You're my big brother.
We've had beefs, yeah, but... fuck that shit.
You said sorry.That was all I needed.
We move on.
Agreed?
Cool.
You know it.
Gonna be smooth as.
What about Liv?
What about her?
Well, don't we have to talk about...?
We don't have to do anything.
Me and her, it was... a thing, a bit of fun.
Nothing else.
Yeah, she was into me, but I was just dealing with shit.
Really?
Totally.
Seriously, you have nothing to worry about.
I wasn't worrying about me.
Good.
Are you into her?
Dunno.
Might be.
So you're fine with it, then?
Super fine!
Me and Mini are better than ever.
Deep shit.
Cool.
That'll be her now.
Matty, the rules!
Yeah, I know, but I didn't know them when she called.
Yeah, but still...
Listen, Nick you trust me, right?
Fine.
I get it.
Compromise.
Give.
Take.
You're a star.
Mini, it's me.
I need to see you.
Hi.
Your mum let me in.
Prepare to be spoiled.
Flowers, chocolates, oils.
They're beautiful.
Of course, I can't eat the chocolates, but Mum...
Oils?
Massage oils.
You're in for some Nick nuzzling.
How's that?
Good, yeah?
Great.
You know it.
That's...
That's really...
God, Nick!
Nick!
What?
What?
You're... you're jabbing into me with... it.
Yeah, he's feeling left out.
Argh, not... not there!
Argh, not... not there!
Shit.
Sorry.
Do you want to go on top?
Quickly.
I'm trying.
It won't...
And if we get to the final, there'll be scouts and shit, and that means one thing.
Really?
What sort of scouts?
Pros.
The big time, baby!
I could be your WAG.
There's Matty.
Come on.
What happened to you?
Went to meet my favourite girl...
Mini.
Hi, Liv.
Isn't this great?
Two brothers, two best mates.
The awesome foursome in the perfect storm.
Didn't everyone die in The Perfect Storm?
Didn't everyone die in The Perfect Storm?
Details, mate.
The point is, we're wet... and... dangerous.
There's my boys.
Check this out.
Go on, mate.
Spank that ball, baby.
Spank that ball.
Jizz ball, you big gay!
Later, homos.
Love those guys.
Here comes the old man.
Boys.
Laters, girls.
Don't.
What?
Whatever it is.
Just don't.
Well, it's a most irregular situation.
We're well into term.
Matthew's record is hardly unblemished.
In fact, it is positively flecked with failure, disobedience and misdemeanour.
He was misunderstood, sir.
A history of drug abuse and violence.
We dropped those charges.
That Matty's in the past.
He's moved on, sir.
Right.
Mr Blood.
When I first agreed to send Nick here, despite offers from several other, and frankly better, alternatives, you promised certain privileges.
Of course, some of those offers are still... on the table.
I see.
And what of Mrs Levan?
Is she as committed to this new direction?
Mrs Levan isn't committed to anything.
Her family in particular, as well you know.
Professor Blood, you brought me here to win games.
I'm winning games.
As I said he would.
Straight up.
He won't step out of line, out of respect for me.
Right, Matthew?
100%.
Very well.
He may re-enrol.
On probation.
Thank you, sir.
That is absolutely wicked.
What a bell-end.
Who does he think he is?
Giving it the big I am.
He's just a jumped up babysitter with an office.
Prick!
Right.
I've got to go.
Places to be.
Clients to save.
Just you remember, every move you make, every step you take I'll be watching you.
Isn't that The Police?
Isn't that The Police?
It will be, my boy, if you fuck up.
OK.
It will be.
Right-o.
High five, Mattattack, you're in!
Fuck me, dude.
I don't know how you put up with this shit.
What do you mean, "put up"?
I've got it all right here.
It's all right here in the Nickosaur's mighty palm of destiny.
If you say so.
If you say so.
Of course I do.
Come on.
Hop in, we'll go meet the gang.
The rugby guys?
No!
My guys.
The gang!
You'll love them, come on!
Shithead.
Bollocks!
Officer on deck.
How's the wriggle team?
Oh, thank God.
My hero boyfriend is here to save the day.
Listen, guys.This is Matty.
I know you met him before, but that was all, well, drama-rama, so...
It's you.
Hi.
You two know each other?
We met once.
So you were homeless?
More on the move.
It must have been really hard.
Nah.
After the first few blowjobs, you get used to the taste, then it's pretty lucrative, really.
That's not true.
Isn't this wicked?
The Bloods and the Cripples together at last.
You get me?
What's he talking about?
Nick's suggesting that we're a bunch of cripples and that he and Mini are similar to a black, violent, LA street gang.
Anyway, I've gotta run, so...
Are you coming to this thing later?
What thing?
I didn't know about a thing.
Meet properly.
Nah, big game tomorrow, so...
Best run.
Officer on deck!
Everyone brought their A game?
A game's the only one I've got.
Glad to hear it, champ!
What's with Liv, man?
What's with Liv, man?
What about her?
That fucking scrawny little turd-corn she was with.
I thought she was into real men.
She was never into you, Rides.
He was like a sort of weird little miniature gay.
Surprised the little pecker hasn't drowned in my sloppy seconds.
Surprised the little pecker hasn't drowned in my sloppy seconds.
Rider, shut the fuck up, yeah?
Hey, what?
You into her or something?
He's my brother.
Your brother?
Him?
He's your brother?
What did they do?
Raise the afterbirth and give it a name?
Rider, that's enough, mate.
All right, skip.
Calm down.
Fuck it.
He can have the manky bitch.
Reckon I wore her out last time.
Once old Ride's had his way, they're ruined.
Rider, one more word and I'll smack you!
What the fuck, man?
She's not your bird.
What the fuck are you all doing?
We're supposed to be training, yeah?
So, a low contact run.
No big hits, ja?
Work though your moves and give it up if you're caught, right?
Right?
Play!
Benny's ball!
Jesus Christ, Levan.
What the fuck was that?
Got carried away.
Too fucking right you did!
So... you gonna tell me what the matter is, then, eh?
I'm just nervous about the game, coach.
Don't tug me, boy.
You can say what you like, but muscles never lie.
Argh!
I can read a body like a book, boy, and this is a depressing book about an anxious young man.
Argh!
Fuck!
Just as I thought.
An anxious young man who's worrying about a girl.
You know what I think about those types of books?
No, sir.
They're no good to me before a big game.
You know...
I've got a brother.
Back in Jo'burg.
I didn't speak to him for ten years.
OK...
OK...
Just shut up and listen, ja?
He was a bastard, right?
Angry, bigoted young man.
I hated his guts, but I...
I don't have a problem with Matty, coach.
Yes, you do.
I can feel it.
Argh!
Shit!
Nothing.
I'm not doing anything.
OK.
Why are you hanging around outside?
I was about to call you, to see where you are, if you were coming.
But you're here now, so... ace.
Grace called me.
Nice one.
Come on, then.
Feel the love, guys.
Hey, man.
Hey, man.
Hi.
What's the chat?
We're planning how to find Alo a girlfriend.
Wicked.
What's the brief?
The brief?
Yeah.
What are you after?
Short-term lover, desperate fuck, the love of your life?
You've got to set your aim on your prey, know their weaknesses, then... dah, hunt them down.
He's not picky.
I am!
A bit.
Well, not really.
Why not?
here, so why not hook up?
Needs must, right?
Then we'd all be couples.
We could swing and shit.
Then we'd all be couples.
We could swing and shit.
Ew!
I'm going to go to the bar.
I'll give her a hand.
You've got a full pint.
Not any more.
So you and Matty, hey?
How's it going?
Nick, let's not do this.
Do what?
You know what.
I'm just, you know, checking everything's all right.
That he's, you know...
What?
He smashed up our entire house.
He goes crazy and I don't want that to happen again.
Not to you.
Oh, yeah.
Good one.
I see, you're worried I might get hurt.
That's it.
No...
No...
Nick, what is this?
Have you got a problem
I don't have a problem.
I just...
I just wonder what it means for us?
Us?
Nick, there is no us.
There never was.
Come on, we had good times.
We fucked... twice.
And I wasn't even fucking you.
I was fucking Mini.
I don't know what that means.
No, of course you don't.
Nick, she knows about us and she's still with you.
Don't you think that's fucked up?
We're fine.
Better than ever.
If that's what you think, then you two deserve each other.
12 sambucas, please, chap.
What the fuck are you doing?
What am I doing?
This is me, is it, my fault?
This isn't cool.
I'm having a good time.
I'm having a good time.
You're out of order.
Why?
Cos I danced with your best mate?
Bruv, leave it.
Bruv, leave it.
Matty, stay out of this.
before she gets horny again and fucks a passer...
I think you broke my nose!
Mini!
Don't suddenly act like you care.
I do.
If you cared, why did you fuck my best friend?
!
Mins...
Mins...
Fuck you!
Fuck you, Nick.
Nick...
Shit!
Shit.
Won't your friends be missing you?
Everything's so fucking easy for you, isn't it?
!
I've worked my arse off, done everything I'm supposed to, like nothing happened and fuck up my life again!
I'm not the one fucking you up, Nick.
Where the fuck have you been?
Out.
Dad, it's 2am.
Where are you going?
Warren's killed himself.
I gave that bastard more time, care and attention than any fucker in his life, and they want to question me?
Give me shit?
All I try and do is help and I get blamed when things go wrong.
Blame culture.
That's what's wrong with this country.
Dad, I need to talk to you...
The state of you.
What the fuck are you playing at?
I've had a bad night.
You had a bad night because you chose to have one!
Or is that my fault too?
Dad, I need...
Fuck's sake, Nick!
Grow up.
Aaaaargh!
Aaaargh!
Nick!
Go.
Go!
Liv!
Liv!
Aaargh!
Nick!
What the fuck?
!
I need to speak to you.
No, you need to go.
No!
Please, Liv.
You're the only one that understands me.
I need you, Liv.
No, you don't, Nick.
I don't know what you need, but it's not me.
Go home, Nick.
Are you all right?
You look... fucked.
Fucked, I mean.
Not all right.
What's your name?
It's Matty.
Who are those children?
They're my kids.
How old are you, Matty?
Old enough.
Can we have some more?
Not now.
I want to feel something, Matty.
What are you doing here?
I live round the corner.
No, I'm good.
You look like shit, you know.
Yeah.
I think I managed to fuck just about everything up.
You know that I'm that people think I'm... a dick?
Sometimes I do things I know I shouldn't and I do 'em anyway, cos...
Fuck.Why do I do them?
You're not a complete dick.
Thanks.
So, what are you gonna do now, then?
Well, I'll leave you to it.
You're late, Levan.
I'm not playing.
I can see that.
Ever.
I'm done, that's it.
I need to sort some shit out, cos if I don't, I'll go crazy and I'll end up fucked up and alone, and I can't be like that.
And... and rugby... rugby... isn't helping, and actually, I hate it.
and Rider.
I fucking hate Rider.
And I hate...
I hate too much at the moment, coach, and I need to...
I need to stop.
But I don't hate you, coach, so I wanted to you know...
Well, if that's the way you feel.
So... what are you going to do about it?
I'm leaving.
I'm gonna find my brother, and we're gonna leave.
I can't...
We can't be with my dad any more, coach.
You're gonna run away.
That it?
I'm not running away.
Yes, you are!
It's all very well seeing an injustice, Nick.
That's the easy part.
What you do next is the hard part.
It defines a man.
I can't be happy in that house, coach!
You want to be happy?
That it, ja?
You know who this is?
Yeah, course, but...
He's a happy man, ja?
Respected.
Everybody loves Madiba.
He's fair and peaceful and friendly.
But when he was your age, he was a right angry fucker.
Furious, ja.
He blew things up.
Fought and fought and fought against the shit he came up against.
He never ran away.
They had to lock the bastard away to try to stop him, and even then he fought.
I don't know what you're saying.
I'm saying I thought you were stronger than someone who runs, Nick.
Stand up for yourself.
I am.
No, you're not.
Just saying...
You're a coward, ja.
Fuck you, coach.
Fucking bottler.
Luck, boys.See you around.
Where are you going?
Put your bag down.
You were supposed to be keeping an eye on him.
You were supposed to be keeping an eye on him.
Shut up.
What?
I did it.
Don't believe you.
I don't care what you believe.
I see.
You're standing up for yourself.
Is that it?
He's got to you.
I know you, Nick, and you wouldn't have done shit if it wasn't for him.No!
I wouldn't have done shit if it wasn't for you.
None of this would have happened if you'd just...
Fuck!
Stop being a cunt.
So, what, you... you're ganging up on me now, are you?
Yeah.
Yes, we are.
Contract.
...Ooooh!
We've decided you're leaving college.
This is just victimisation.
Reason for leaving?
I'll just put simpleton.
You've gotta stickit to the man, bruv.
Mum...!
Mum...!
Come on then, Dad, let's have it, shall we?
Let's get naked, go out there and show those old fuckers who's boss!
Excuse me?
Have we met?
Never.
Are you sure?
I'm, uh, really good with faces.
Me, too.
Sorry.
Wow.
You were totally timing yourself.
Yeah.
So, choosing this moment to come over here and ask you out...
Epic fail, right?
Maybe...
Maybe not.
I'm Tom.
- Wow, really?
- Carrie Wells.
What's the location?
I'm on my way.
So, Carrie Wells...
Two questions.
Are you single?
And, uh...
can I have your number?
Yes.
And why don't I take yours?
Uh... yeah.
Sure.
Borrow a pen?
Don't need a pen.
I'll remember it.
What've we got?
We got a fresh one, up on the fourth.
- Where's Al?
- He's coming in from the city.
He and Elaine were looking at apartments uptown.
Oh.
Al hit the lotto with that one.
How do I land a girl with a trust fund?
Try brushing your teeth.
All right, so the vic is in apartment 4B.
Says the place is rented to a Peter Forrest.
Hey, guys.
Sorry, tunnel was a mess.
What'd I miss?
Neighbors heard shots.
Factory condo conversion, about 40 units.
Shooting victim's up on the fourth floor, we're heading in now.
What are they doing here?
Mike, get with the building super.
Get a list of residents, security footage.
All right.
I'm on it.
Nina, Roe... catch up out here.
Carrie, with me.
Whoa!
You're going the wrong way, people!
NYPD.
I got a body up there.
Doesn't matter.
There's a gas leak.
Getting everybody out.
Did you have a chance to examine the scene?
No, they didn't.
They're on their way out, and so are you.
We have a crime scene in there.
Sorry, you can examine your crime scene after we turn off the gas.
Hey, Joey, Kevin, help this woman out.
Come on, guys.
Let's go.
Clear out, everybody!
Get outta here.
We can't shut off the gas!
Carrie!
Clear out.
Everybody!
Clear out.
Carrie, Carrie, come on, it's gonna blow!
No joke.
They can't shut off the gas.
We gotta go.
- I'm, I...
- Now!
Come on, Carrie, come on!
It's gonna blow.
Hey, what part of "evacuate" don't you unders...?
You guys all right?
Yeah, we're fine.
Looks like we got a corrupted crime scene.
No, it's okay.
I got it.
♪ Unforgettable 1x04 ♪ Up in Flames Original Air Date on October 11, 2011
There were powder burns on his shirt.
No, he fell the other way.
That way.
Yea, that's it, there.
The victim was lying about ten feet from the door.
He was shot twice in the chest at close range.
There are no signs of struggle.
And no forced entry.
- I think we got something.
- Hit me.
The 116th's been working a string of robbery-homicides.
Similar pattern.
Upscale buildings, no doormen, vics are robbed at their own front door.
Anyone shot?
This wasn't a robbery.
Well, he-he he still had his watch on.
Patek Philippe.
Maybe the perp panicked.
Never made it inside.
You were in there for like what, 30 seconds?
Just under.
Look, all we're saying is, this could line up with the other pop and grabs.
See if it does.
Talk to 116th.
And get with the Arson Squad.
This gas leak is pretty convenient.
Peter Forrest, age 42.
Good-lookin' guy.
DMV lists a home address on Fifth Avenue.
So what's our murder scene, second apartment?
We could ask the wife, Allison Forrest.
Same Fifth Avenue address.
Lease has him as vice president with Sims Bennett Brokerage.
That explains the second apartment.
All those Wall Street guys, total players.
Hey, maybe the guy just needed a quiet place to, you know, meditate.
Oh, that what you call it now?
Did you say, "Sims Bennett"?
Someone was shredding Sims Bennett files.
There's an account label.
Um...
Can you see what it was?
My view's kind of blocked.
It...
It looks like the initials HH.
If he's shredding when he gets them, maybe this HH account's the reason why.
Nina, Roe, find me the wife already.
Carrie, Mike, let's get over to Forrest's office.
Thank you.
That would be very helpful.
Who's he talking to?
Oh, my guess?
The district attorney.
High-profile victim, gas explosion.
We have all the resources we need.
Sure thing, Counselor.
We'll keep you in the loop.
Thank you.
- Gilroy?
- Who else?
The guy grabs any case might make the evening news.
Forrest sure lived the high life.
Isn't that Pebble Beach?
Greens fee's what, 500 a head?
Is that a Formula One fantasy camp?
Bailout dollars at work.
Detectives, I'm Sydney Burrell.
I worked closely with Peter.
This is Gary Wright, General Counsel.
You work closely with Peter, too?
Our policy is to have counsel present for any legal inquiry regarding an employee.
Yeah, our policy is to find out who killed him.
And to that end... only HH account we could find is Howard Hinkel.
It was one of Peter's oldest accounts.
Any reason it might have something to do with him being killed?
I can't think of any.
Do you know where we can find Mr. Hinkel?
Woodlawn Cemetery.
He died in 1878.
We've repped the Howard Hinkel Endowment for decades.
Pretty cutthroat environment around here, no?
Forrest have any rivals for this corner office?
Nobody here resented Peter's success.
He earned it.
What about outside the firm?
Clients?
People in his personal life?
Uh, we can't give out confidential information about our clients without a court order.
You understand.
Sure.
We understand.
So, could you just supply us with a list of personnel?
Of course.
Mr. Burrell?
I, uh... noticed from the photo you and Peter go way back.
We're gonna do our best on this one.
Look, there was an... an incident with a client about a month ago.
He was heavily overexposed in the housing market.
Ignored Peter's advice, really chased returns.
When the bubble burst, he got hurt, pretty badly.
And he blamed Peter.
He threatened to kill Peter.
Sydney, you wanna walk these guys
- down to personnel?
- Sure.
You got a name for me?
Brezner.
Isaac Brezner.
Thank you.
Isaac, we need you over here.
Drape it like this.
Ugh!
Five minutes.
Yes, I threatened to kill Peter Forrest.
The guy lost me millions.
I also threatened to kill my assistant when he wore Tommy Hilfiger to my niece's bat mitzvah.
So?
Where were you yesterday afternoon?
Front row at Stella McCartney.
So you'll be in the pictures.
I already am.
Check online.
You guys should be looking for a jealous boyfriend.
The number of girls Peter was chasing?
He was a fixture at my show.
Brought his colleagues backstage to meet the models.
You know how many times I got those guys laid?
No.
How many times?
You are aware that the victim was married.
It's okay, honey.
So was I.
Yeah, his alibi checks out.
He was front row at the show.
Is that a fur suit?
Yeah, I could imagine offing Forrest.
If I was his wife.
Ah, this operation's a trifle loaded for you, huh, Detective?
Okay.
All right, wife just surfaced.
Al and Carrie are headed over to her now.
Forrest sure liked his views.
He's not the only one.
I hear you and Elaine are looking in the city.
Thinking about it.
I always knew there was an uptown guy underneath those trucker hats and bowling shirts.
What bowling shirts?
"Talent to Spare," "Shut Up and Bowl."
Whatever happened to that one?
You gave it to a kid who scored a six-bagger on his 14th birthday.
- Did I?
- Yep.
July 17, 1999.
Old Galaxy Lanes on Erie Boulevard.
It was a Saturday night.
I'm impressed.
Wild guess.
It's okay.
Not a bad thing.
Hey, guys.
What have you got?
Why do you have a glass rabbit on your bookshelf?
Why?
Where should it be?
- And it's a hare.
- It has hair?
No, it's...
Look, until you agree to move in with me, you have no right to question my decor.
Now I'm in trouble.
I'm serious.
What do you think?
I think the hare looks really great where it is.
So Brezner's not our guy.
Nah, doesn't look like it.
Let's, uh...
let's not say any more than we have to at this point.
So that was the last time you saw your husband?
On Sunday?
I left for my conference the next morning.
Where was the conference?
Hartford.
In the Hilton.
- So you were separated?
- Yes.
He was living at the apartment in Queens.
But we were patching things up.
We were even talking about him moving back in.
Why'd you two split up?
Neither of us came from money.
I worked to pay the bills while he got his degree, and then he did the same for me.
Then he got the job at Sims Bennett.
It was the height of the Internet thing.
All the jet-setting, crazy hours, sleeping around.
All of it.
But you guys were, uh, working things out?
About three months ago, Peter came to me and said he was really turning his life around.
He'd started to take on charities.
He even went to therapy.
He begged me to give him another chance.
So, as far as you know, there was no one else?
Why are you asking me this?
So sorry, Mrs. Forrest.
We just have to consider the possibility that someone didn't want to see you reconciled.
Yes.
Okay.
There was one.
She'd call here in the middle of the night sometimes.
I heard Peter yell at her to leave us alone.
He told me that he would take care of it.
Do you think that this woman...
We don't know.
All right, wife's in the clear.
According to the conference director,
Allison Forrest was moderating panels the whole morning of the murder.
Maybe they were on the mend.
If Peter Forrest reformed himself, I want more evidence.
I got some.
Turns out Allison was telling the truth about those calls they were getting.
They trace back to the Sims Bennett office extension of one Claire Hewson.
She was an assistant in Forrest's department.
Was?
They let her go three weeks ago.
That's around the time
- the calls started.
- Guy's a saint.
Goes back to the wife, fires the girlfriend.
And gives her two very good reasons to want revenge.
It gets better.
Hewson was picked up on a DWI two days ago.
Arresting found her passed out in her car.
Check out the address.
Hunter's Point.
She was in front of Forrest's building.
Where he was killed less than 24 hours later.
How long was she in custody?
Only a few hours.
She posted bail and was released the next morning.
So she got out in time to kill Forrest.
Police.
We have a search warrant.
Ms. Hewson?
Check the bedroom.
I got a body.
Clear!
She's dead.
Two through the chest.
Same shooter?
Maybe.
We got a dead husband, dead girlfriend.
And a wife whose alibi checks out.
Wife's rich.
Maybe someone does it for her.
Her hygienist.
They're all evil.
Not when you brush.
Maybe this is what put her over the edge.
"Dearest Claire, forgive me.
Be mine forever.
P."
I don't get it.
Now he's proposing to her?
I don't want to say anything, but...
Restores your faith in the unfaithful?
Well, Claire wasn't wearing the ring, so maybe she's not sold on the idea.
Follow up with the jeweler...
let's make sure
Forrest really bought this ring.
Mr. District Attorney.
- How are you?
- Good.
Good to see you.
I'm glad you came by.
Who's that...
Gilroy?
Boy Wonder himself.
Al's pretty good with him.
Yeah, I can see that.
So we're thinking from the note and the ring,
Forrest was still at it with the Hewson girl.
We're just following up with the jeweler now.
We looked into the wrong account at Sims Bennett.
Can you hold on a sec?
It's okay.
What do you have, Detective?
It wasn't "HH"
on the file box in Forrest's apartment.
It was "HYH." Come here.
I want you to look at this.
When I was in Forrest's apartment, I couldn't see that box of files he was shredding clearly.
Right?
So I missed that there was a letter between the two H's.
I'm confused.
I thought our crime scene blew up.
No...
Detective Wells was able to examine the scene briefly.
I see.
Right.
So, like I was saying,
I think we looked into the wrong account.
Can you give us a moment?
Can I talk to you?
- Why are we over here?
- Because I'd rather keep the scope of our investigation at this point to ourselves until...
- Until what?
- Until we're ready to present it coherently to our ADA.
Was I not being coherent?
Because I can speak slower.
Carrie, what you can do and how it can help, in terms of actually building a case,
- from their perspective...
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
You didn't tell them, did you?
They know you're a great detective.
They saw your numbers in Syracuse.
Why did you bring me in here and not tell them what I do?
Because it's hard at first for people to accept.
Come on, you race up, you haven't even met Gilroy yet, you're throwing out stuff from left field.
That could help solve this case, Al.
If I was the prosecutor, I would want to know that information.
All Adam Gilroy wants to know is that he can stand in front of a microphone and assure a bunch of nervous real estate developers that Hunter's Point is going to be the next Sutton Place.
I got it.
You have to hustle the front office.
That's your job.
But don't stop me from doing mine.
I thought you guys never got into Forrest's place.
Yeah, well, uh, I guess Wells had a look around.
A look around?
And she's picking out file names?
What can I say?
She's observant.
We want to stop our kids from making the same mistakes we did.
And we can make a difference one life at a time.
What do you got?
Help Your Homies.
HYH.
It's a charity that helps gang members get back on their feet after they get out of prison.
Peter Forrest set up their nonprofit status and managed their money.
Oh, one of his life crisis projects.
And Claire Hewson assisted Forrest on the account.
Strange thing about your Homies account is that Forrest closed it three days ago.
Where'd the money go?
That's a good question.
Maybe he had his hand in the till.
Could've been looking to set up a new life with Claire.
Yeah, stealing from ex-gangbangers... that's a good way to end your old life.
I think it's time we talk to the Head Homie.
That's the fun part.
The guy who runs the charity is doing 25 to life upstate.
- Come again.
- Pablo Hortua.
He's in prison.
Got brothers coming to me all the time saying, "Pablo, I want to change," you know?
They don't have the means to do anything about it.
So they're out there slinging again, and bam, their asses wind up right back in here.
So me and Ramon, we say to ourselves,
"Hey, look, man, we got to break this cycle."
Maybe it's too late for us, but for those other eses, it's not too late for them.
- It's impressive.
- It's working.
Brothers are turning their lives around.
And our boy, Peter Forrest... he was taking our operation to a whole nother level.
How'd you... how'd you guys hook up with Peter?
Well, we reached out to him after I read about him and some cancer charity...
you know, how he was using their money to make more money.
You know, to get respect money, real money.
Money to make a change, money to lobby politicians.
You know, I figured he could do the same for us.
And yet your relationship with Forrest ended recently.
How come?
Our boy couldn't come up with the time he thought we needed.
So he recommended we hire somebody who'd give us their full attention.
So you moved your funds elsewhere?
Peter got us a new bank, yeah.
You confirm Forrest did this?
That the money's there?
Man, what do you think?
Yes, I know what the agreement says.
Have Mike follow the money.
Make sure this bank transfer happened the way they say.
I'll bring her to you Sunday.
You know, if this was a dead end, I'm sorry.
If it's a dead end, you're fired.
Come on, she's perfectly safe with me.
So it checks out.
The Homies' funds are accounted for.
Peter Forrest just moved them to another bank.
He didn't steal a cent.
So we're back to the wife.
See if there's another angle.
For all we know, there's an overprotective cousin out there.
Not sure we need that.
I went to the jeweler.
Get this.
Forrest isn't the one who bought Claire that ring.
That's Marine Sergeant Patrick Woodson.
He was Hewson's ex-boyfriend.
A salesgirl says he was talking her ear off about how he just got back from Afghanistan, was going to surprise Claire with the ring.
So Sergeant Woodson comes home and pops the question, then finds out that his girlfriend has been doing Peter Forrest the whole time he's been flying solo in Kandahar.
So he loses it, kills her, drives across town and pops Forrest.
Yeah.
Nice little detail:
Woodson was dishonorably discharged three weeks ago.
Pulled a gun on a superior officer.
So you went straight from the airport to the jewelry store, huh?
- I made up my mind.
- So then what, Patrick?
You proposed?
The next day, I took her to the park.
There's a spot by the pond.
It's where we had our first date.
I was going to do it there before I deployed, but, God forbid something happened to me, I...
I didn't want her to have to live with that.
Sure.
So what'd she say?
She said she needed more time.
Time for what?
Stand-up guy like you.
What did she need time for?
No, it...
it was okay.
I didn't want to rush her into anything.
So Claire needed time.
Yeah.
But then you knew something wasn't right.
So, what, you started looking into it, watching after her a little?
No.
I wasn't watching her.
Right, 'cause you were out in Jersey all week playing video games at your squad-mate's apartment.
Yeah.
So then how'd you find out that Claire had been seeing this other guy?
What other guy?
You were out in Jersey for those two days?
- What other guy?
- Anybody else see you there?
Was your squad-mate at home?
You think I shot Claire?
No, we're just talking here, Patrick.
Not anymore.
I want a lawyer.
So I talked to
Woodson's squad-mate, the one he's bunking with... kid works nights in Hoboken at the CH Ice Cream factory.
I love their sweet cream.
Yeah, well, sweeter still, that means Woodson's alibi sleeps all day.
Lousy alibi doesn't put him at our murder scene.
Not that it matters, but we got Forrest's watch.
In case you were wondering, a Patek Philippe.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Also got this from the Arson Squad.
They're saying the leak started in the hallway, two floors above
Peter Forrest's apartment.
Two floors above the murder scene?
Why whack someone then head upstairs to start a gas leak?
Doesn't make any sense.
Yeah, it does.
The 911 call came in at 2:13 p.m.
At 2:19, the uniforms were on the scene.
They were close.
You think the fast response time trapped our killer in the building?
There's only one stairwell, right?
He goes up, got no way out.
So he starts a gas leak, uses the crowd to get out.
Smart.
You and I were going into that building while people were leaving.
I know.
I don't see Woodson.
Are you absolutely sure?
Come on everybody.
Oh, my God.
That doesn't make any sense.
Ramon Garza was there.
The guy from the charity?
Al, he walked right by us.
That's impossible;
he's in prison.
I know he's in prison, but I-I know what I saw.
He was there.
Could you be mixing two memories?
No.
I saw him there.
I did.
He's behind bars, Carrie.
I know that, but I saw him.
I'm tell...
I hear you're liking the Marine.
How close are we?
Woodson's fading a little, Adam.
Lousy alibi, but nothing puts him at either scene.
Thought we had prints from the girl's place.
Yeah, but they were together, and he admits being over there.
We have an alternative theory.
- Another suspect?
- We're considering several...
Yes, we have another suspect.
Who would that be?
Ramon Garza.
And is this the same Ramon Garza you interviewed concerning the Homies charity?
Yes.
The Ramon Garza who is an inmate at the maximum security facility at Ossining?
Yes.
He was exiting Forrest's building the day of the murder.
And you know this how?
Because I saw him there.
What is this, Burns?
Detective Wells remembers passing Ramon Garza as he left the crime scene.
I would say, at the moment, that makes him our primary suspect.
I'm supposed to tell my boss that the guy we're looking at for these murders is currently serving 25 to life?
That's what I'm telling you.
What you tell your boss is up to you.
How about this.
How about I don't tell Mr. Fleming anything right now, and before we go to trial, you come up with a real suspect.
That way, we both keep our jobs.
Keep up the good work.
Well...
Have a good night, Halsey.
See you tomorrow.
Officer Halsey.
Hey.
Uh, Carr...
Detective Wells.
We met the other day.
Oh, yeah.
How's it going?
Good.
You got a sec?
Uh, now's a little tough.
I got somewhere to be.
Please, just...
it'll only take a minute.
I just, I don't want to have to drive all the way up here again.
So, you know Ramon Garza, right?
Sure, everyone does.
Regular Mother Theresa in there.
Right.
And you're C.O. number 046?
Yeah.
Your corrections sergeant...
he told me you're the one who's generally responsible for doing the daily inmate checks.
A real privilege.
Yeah.
And that day before yesterday, you were the one who accounted for Ramon Garza's cell check.
If that's what the file says.
Right.
No, it's just...
do you actually remember seeing him here that day?
I count hundreds of inmates.
Oh, I'm sure.
No, I get it.
I was just, I was wondering if maybe there's a way...
I don't know...
the inmates can game the system.
You know, have one guy call out "here" for another guy when his name comes up, something like that.
It's not kindergarten.
We put eyes on every inmate, verify it's them.
So Ramon Garza...
he was definitely here that day?
Where the hell else would he be?
Beats me.
I was just...
Yeah, you're right.
Okay.
Uh, well, thank you for your time.
I appreciate it.
No problem.

Okay, so we go at this Halsey.

Yeah, not from Gilroy.
Gilroy's not running this investigation.

So, could you just supply us with a list of personnel?
Of course.
Mr. Burrell?
I, uh... noticed from the photo you and Peter go way back.
We're gonna do our best on this one.
Look, there was an... an incident with a client about a month ago.
He was heavily overexposed in the housing market.
Ignored Peter's advice, really chased returns.
When the bubble burst, he got hurt, pretty badly.
And he blamed Peter.
He threatened to kill Peter.
Sydney, you wanna walk these guys
- down to personnel?
- Sure.
You got a name for me?
Brezner.
Isaac Brezner.
Thank you.
WOMAN:
Isaac, we need you over here.
Drape it like this.
Ugh!
Five minutes.
Yes, I threatened to kill Peter Forrest.
The guy lost me millions.
I also threatened to kill my assistant when he wore Tommy Hilfiger to my niece's bat mitzvah.
So?
Where were you yesterday afternoon?
Front row at Stella McCartney.
So you'll be in the pictures.
I already am.
Check online.
You guys should be looking for a jealous boyfriend.
The number of girls Peter was chasing?
He was a fixture at my show.
Brought his colleagues backstage to meet the models.
You know how many times I got those guys laid?
No.
How many times?
You are aware that the victim was married.
It's okay, honey.
So was I.
Yeah, his alibi checks out.
He was front row at the show.
Is that a fur suit?
Yeah, I could imagine offing Forrest.
If I was his wife.
Ah, this operation's a trifle loaded for you, huh, Detective?
Okay.
All right, wife just surfaced.
Al and Carrie are headed over to her now.
Forrest sure liked his views.
He's not the only one.
I hear you and Elaine are looking in the city.
Thinking about it.
I always knew there was an uptown guy underneath those trucker hats and bowling shirts.
What bowling shirts?
"Talent to Spare," "Shut Up and Bowl."
Whatever happened to that one?
You gave it to a kid who scored a six-bagger on his 14th birthday.
- Did I?
- Yep.
July 17, 1999.
Old Galaxy Lanes on Erie Boulevard.
It was a Saturday night.
I'm impressed.
Wild guess.
It's okay.
Not a bad thing.
NINA:
Hey, guys.
AL:
What have you got?
(Carrie and Al laughing)
CARRIE:
Why do you have a glass rabbit on your bookshelf?
Why?
Where should it be?
- And it's a hare.
- It has hair?
No, it's... (laughing)
Look, until you agree to move in with me, you have no right to question my decor.
Now I'm in trouble.
I'm serious.
What do you think?
I think the hare looks really great where it is.
AL:
So Brezner's not our guy.
Nah, doesn't look like it.
AL:
Let's, uh...
let's not say any more than we have to at this point.
So that was the last time you saw your husband?
On Sunday?
I left for my conference the next morning.
Where was the conference?
Hartford.
In the Hilton.
- So you were separated?
- Yes.
He was living at the apartment in Queens.
But we were patching things up.
We were even talking about him moving back in.
Why'd you two split up?
Neither of us came from money.
I worked to pay the bills while he got his degree, and then he did the same for me.
Then he got the job at Sims Bennett.
It was the height of the Internet thing.
All the jet-setting, crazy hours, sleeping around.
All of it.
But you guys were, uh, working things out?
About three months ago, Peter came to me and said he was really turning his life around.
He'd started to take on charities.
He even went to therapy.
He begged me to give him another chance.
NINA:
So, as far as you know, there was no one else?
Why are you asking me this?
CARRIE:
So sorry, Mrs. Forrest.
We just have to consider the possibility that someone didn't want to see you reconciled.
Yes.
Okay.
There was one.
She'd call here in the middle of the night sometimes.
I heard Peter yell at her to leave us alone.
He told me that he would take care of it.
Do you think that this woman...
We don't know.
All right, wife's in the clear.
According to the conference director,
Allison Forrest was moderating panels the whole morning of the murder.
Maybe they were on the mend.
If Peter Forrest reformed himself, I want more evidence.
I got some.
Turns out Allison was telling the truth about those calls they were getting.
They trace back to the Sims Bennett office extension of one Claire Hewson.
She was an assistant in Forrest's department.
Was?
They let her go three weeks ago.
MIKE:
That's around the time
- the calls started.
NINA:
- Guy's a saint.
Goes back to the wife, fires the girlfriend.
MIKE:
And gives her two very good reasons to want revenge.
ROE:
It gets better.
Hewson was picked up on a DWI two days ago.
Arresting found her passed out in her car.
Check out the address.
Hunter's Point.
She was in front of Forrest's building.
Where he was killed less than 24 hours later.
How long was she in custody?
Only a few hours.
She posted bail and was released the next morning.
So she got out in time to kill Forrest.
(horn honking)
(knocking on door)
Police.
We have a search warrant.
Ms. Hewson?
Check the bedroom.
I got a body.
MIKE:
Clear!
She's dead.
Two through the chest.
Same shooter?
Maybe.
AL:
We got a dead husband, dead girlfriend.
MIKE:
And a wife whose alibi checks out.
Wife's rich.
Maybe someone does it for her.
Her hygienist.
They're all evil.
Not when you brush.
NINA:
Maybe this is what put her over the edge.
"Dearest Claire, forgive me.
Be mine forever.
P."
I don't get it.
Now he's proposing to her?
I don't want to say anything, but...
Restores your faith in the unfaithful?
MIKE:
Well, Claire wasn't wearing the ring, so maybe she's not sold on the idea.
Follow up with the jeweler...
let's make sure
Forrest really bought this ring.
AL:
Mr. District Attorney.
- How are you?
- Good.
Good to see you.
I'm glad you came by.
Who's that...
Gilroy?
Boy Wonder himself.
Al's pretty good with him.
Yeah, I can see that.
AL:
So we're thinking from the note and the ring,
Forrest was still at it with the Hewson girl.
We're just following up with the jeweler now.
We looked into the wrong account at Sims Bennett.
Can you hold on a sec?
It's okay.
What do you have, Detective?
It wasn't "HH"
on the file box in Forrest's apartment.
It was "HYH." Come here.
I want you to look at this.
When I was in Forrest's apartment, I couldn't see that box of files he was shredding clearly.
Right?
So I missed that there was a letter between the two H's.
I'm confused.
I thought our crime scene blew up.
No...
Detective Wells was able to examine the scene briefly.
GILROY:
I see.
Right.
So, like I was saying,
I think we looked into the wrong account.
Can you give us a moment?
Can I talk to you?
- Why are we over here?
- Because I'd rather keep the scope of our investigation at this point to ourselves until...
- Until what?
- Until we're ready to present it coherently to our ADA.
Was I not being coherent?
Because I can speak slower.
Carrie, what you can do and how it can help, in terms of actually building a case,
- from their perspective...
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
You didn't tell them, did you?
They know you're a great detective.
They saw your numbers in Syracuse.
Why did you bring me in here and not tell them what I do?
Because it's hard at first for people to accept.
Come on, you race up, you haven't even met Gilroy yet, you're throwing out stuff from left field.
That could help solve this case, Al.
If I was the prosecutor, I would want to know that information.
All Adam Gilroy wants to know is that he can stand in front of a microphone and assure a bunch of nervous real estate developers that Hunter's Point is going to be the next Sutton Place.
I got it.
You have to hustle the front office.
That's your job.
But don't stop me from doing mine.
I thought you guys never got into Forrest's place.
Yeah, well, uh, I guess Wells had a look around.
A look around?
And she's picking out file names?
What can I say?
She's observant.
We want to stop our kids from making the same mistakes we did.
And we can make a difference one life at a time.
What do you got?
Help Your Homies.
HYH.
It's a charity that helps gang members get back on their feet after they get out of prison.
Peter Forrest set up their nonprofit status and managed their money.
Oh, one of his life crisis projects.
And Claire Hewson assisted Forrest on the account.
MIKE:
Strange thing about your Homies account is that Forrest closed it three days ago.
Where'd the money go?
That's a good question.
Maybe he had his hand in the till.
Could've been looking to set up a new life with Claire.
MIKE:
Yeah, stealing from ex-gangbangers... that's a good way to end your old life.
I think it's time we talk to the Head Homie.
CARRIE:
That's the fun part.
The guy who runs the charity is doing 25 to life upstate.
- Come again.
- Pablo Hortua.
He's in prison.
(buzzer sounds, door clanks open)
MAN:
Got brothers coming to me all the time saying, "Pablo, I want to change," you know?
They don't have the means to do anything about it.
So they're out there slinging again, and bam, their asses wind up right back in here.
So me and Ramon, we say to ourselves,
"Hey, look, man, we got to break this cycle."
Maybe it's too late for us, but for those other eses, it's not too late for them.
- It's impressive.
RAMON:
- It's working.
Brothers are turning their lives around.
And our boy, Peter Forrest... he was taking our operation to a whole nother level.
How'd you... how'd you guys hook up with Peter?
Well, we reached out to him after I read about him and some cancer charity...
you know, how he was using their money to make more money.
You know, to get respect money, real money.
Money to make a change, money to lobby politicians.
You know, I figured he could do the same for us.
And yet your relationship with Forrest ended recently.
How come?
Our boy couldn't come up with the time he thought we needed.
So he recommended we hire somebody who'd give us their full attention.
So you moved your funds elsewhere?
Peter got us a new bank, yeah.
You confirm Forrest did this?
That the money's there?
Man, what do you think?
MAN:
Yes, I know what the agreement says.
Have Mike follow the money.
Make sure this bank transfer happened the way they say.
I'll bring her to you Sunday.
You know, if this was a dead end, I'm sorry.
If it's a dead end, you're fired.
GUARD:
Come on, she's perfectly safe with me.
MIKE:
So it checks out.
The Homies' funds are accounted for.
Peter Forrest just moved them to another bank.
He didn't steal a cent.
So we're back to the wife.
See if there's another angle.
For all we know, there's an overprotective cousin out there.
Not sure we need that.
I went to the jeweler.
Get this.
Forrest isn't the one who bought Claire that ring.
That's Marine Sergeant Patrick Woodson.
He was Hewson's ex-boyfriend.
A salesgirl says he was talking her ear off about how he just got back from Afghanistan, was going to surprise Claire with the ring.
MIKE:
So Sergeant Woodson comes home and pops the question, then finds out that his girlfriend has been doing Peter Forrest the whole time he's been flying solo in Kandahar.
So he loses it, kills her, drives across town and pops Forrest.
Yeah.
Nice little detail:
Woodson was dishonorably discharged three weeks ago.
Pulled a gun on a superior officer.
NINA:
So you went straight from the airport to the jewelry store, huh?
- I made up my mind.
MIKE:
- So then what, Patrick?
You proposed?
The next day, I took her to the park.
There's a spot by the pond.
It's where we had our first date.
I was going to do it there before I deployed, but, God forbid something happened to me, I... (sighs)
I didn't want her to have to live with that.
Sure.
So what'd she say?
She said she needed more time.
Time for what?
Stand-up guy like you.
What did she need time for?
No, it...
it was okay.
(sighs)
I didn't want to rush her into anything.
So Claire needed time.
Yeah.
But then you knew something wasn't right.
So, what, you started looking into it, watching after her a little?
No.
I wasn't watching her.
Right, 'cause you were out in Jersey all week playing video games at your squad-mate's apartment.
Yeah.
So then how'd you find out that Claire had been seeing this other guy?
What other guy?
You were out in Jersey for those two days?
- What other guy?
- Anybody else see you there?
Was your squad-mate at home?
You think I shot Claire?
No, we're just talking here, Patrick.
Not anymore.
I want a lawyer.
MIKE:
So I talked to
Woodson's squad-mate, the one he's bunking with... kid works nights in Hoboken at the CH Ice Cream factory.
NINA:
I love their sweet cream.
Yeah, well, sweeter still, that means Woodson's alibi sleeps all day.
Lousy alibi doesn't put him at our murder scene.
ROE:
Not that it matters, but we got Forrest's watch.
In case you were wondering, a Patek Philippe.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Also got this from the Arson Squad.
They're saying the leak started in the hallway, two floors above
Peter Forrest's apartment.
Two floors above the murder scene?
Why whack someone then head upstairs to start a gas leak?
Doesn't make any sense.
Yeah, it does.
The 911 call came in at 2:13 p.m.
At 2:19, the uniforms were on the scene.
They were close.
You think the fast response time trapped our killer in the building?
There's only one stairwell, right?
He goes up, got no way out.
ROE:
So he starts a gas leak, uses the crowd to get out.
Smart.
You and I were going into that building while people were leaving.
I know.
(sighs)
I don't see Woodson.
Are you absolutely sure?
Come on everybody.
Oh, my God.
That doesn't make any sense.
Ramon Garza was there.
The guy from the charity?
Al, he walked right by us.
That's impossible;
he's in prison.
I know he's in prison, but I-I know what I saw.
He was there.
AL:
Could you be mixing two memories?
No.
I saw him there.
I did.
He's behind bars, Carrie.
I know that, but I saw him.
I'm tell...
I hear you're liking the Marine.
How close are we?
Woodson's fading a little, Adam.
Lousy alibi, but nothing puts him at either scene.
Thought we had prints from the girl's place.
Yeah, but they were together, and he admits being over there.
We have an alternative theory.
- Another suspect?
- We're considering several...
Yes, we have another suspect.
Who would that be?
Ramon Garza.
And is this the same Ramon Garza you interviewed concerning the Homies charity?
Yes.
The Ramon Garza who is an inmate at the maximum security facility at Ossining?
Yes.
He was exiting Forrest's building the day of the murder.
And you know this how?
Because I saw him there.
(chuckles)
What is this, Burns?
Detective Wells remembers passing Ramon Garza as he left the crime scene.
I would say, at the moment, that makes him our primary suspect.
I'm supposed to tell my boss that the guy we're looking at for these murders is currently serving 25 to life?
That's what I'm telling you.
What you tell your boss is up to you.
How about this.
How about I don't tell Mr. Fleming anything right now, and before we go to trial, you come up with a real suspect.
That way, we both keep our jobs.
Keep up the good work.
Well...
MAN:
Have a good night, Halsey.
See you tomorrow.
Officer Halsey.
Hey.
Uh, Carr...
Detective Wells.
We met the other day.
Oh, yeah.

Good.
You got a sec?
Uh, now's a little tough.
I got somewhere to be.
Please, just...
it'll only take a minute.
I just, I don't want to have to drive all the way up here again.
So, you know Ramon Garza, right?
Sure, everyone does.
Regular Mother Theresa in there.
Right.
And you're C.O. number 046?
Yeah.
Your corrections sergeant...
he told me you're the one who's generally responsible for doing the daily inmate checks.
A real privilege.
Yeah.
And that day before yesterday, you were the one who accounted for Ramon Garza's cell check.
If that's what the file says.
Right.
No, it's just...
do you actually remember seeing him here that day?
I count hundreds of inmates.
Oh, I'm sure.
No, I get it.
I was just, I was wondering if maybe there's a way...
I don't know...
the inmates can game the system.
You know, have one guy call out "here" for another guy when his name comes up, something like that.
It's not kindergarten.
We put eyes on every inmate, verify it's them.
So Ramon Garza...
he was definitely here that day?
Where the hell else would he be?
(laughs)
Beats me.
I was just...
Yeah, you're right.
Okay.
Uh, well, thank you for your time.
I appreciate it.
No problem.

We're talking restaurants in the city, weekends in the Hamptons, cruises to Saint something-or-other.
I mean, she fell hard.
Like, "planning home for the holidays" hard.
So, when she goes by his place one day for lunch to get his shirt sized for a Christmas surprise, she gets her own surprise.

That way.
Yea, that's it, there.
The victim was lying about ten feet from the door.
He was shot twice in the chest at close range.
There are no signs of struggle.
And no forced entry.
- I think we got something.
- Hit me.
The 116th's been working a string of robbery-homicides.
Similar pattern.
Upscale buildings, no doormen, vics are robbed at their own front door.
Anyone shot?
This wasn't a robbery.
Well, he-he he still had his watch on.
Patek Philippe.
Maybe the perp panicked.
Never made it inside.
You were in there for like what, 30 seconds?
Just under.
Look, all we're saying is, this could line up with the other pop and grabs.
See if it does.
Talk to 116th.
And get with the Arson Squad.
This gas leak is pretty convenient.
Peter Forrest, age 42.
Good-lookin' guy.
DMV lists a home address on Fifth Avenue.
So what's our murder scene, second apartment?
We could ask the wife, Allison Forrest.
Same Fifth Avenue address.
Lease has him as vice president with Sims Bennett Brokerage.
That explains the second apartment.
All those Wall Street guys, total players.
Hey, maybe the guy just needed a quiet place to, you know, meditate.
Oh, that what you call it now?
Did you say, "Sims Bennett"?
Someone was shredding Sims Bennett files.
There's an account label.
Um...
Can you see what it was?
My view's kind of blocked.
It...
It looks like the initials HH.
If he's shredding when he gets them, maybe this HH account's the reason why.
Nina, Roe, find me the wife already.
Carrie, Mike, let's get over to Forrest's office.
Thank you.
That would be very helpful.
Who's he talking to?
Oh, my guess?
The district attorney.
High-profile victim, gas explosion.
We have all the resources we need.
Sure thing, Counselor.
We'll keep you in the loop.
Thank you.
- Gilroy?
- Who else?
The guy grabs any case might make the evening news.
Forrest sure lived the high life.
Isn't that Pebble Beach?
Greens fee's what, 500 a head?
Is that a Formula One fantasy camp?
Bailout dollars at work.
Detectives, I'm Sydney Burrell.
I worked closely with Peter.
This is Gary Wright, General Counsel.
You work closely with Peter, too?
Our policy is to have counsel present for any legal inquiry regarding an employee.
Yeah, our policy is to find out who killed him.
And to that end... only HH account we could find is Howard Hinkel.
It was one of Peter's oldest accounts.
Any reason it might have something to do with him being killed?
I can't think of any.
Do you know where we can find Mr. Hinkel?
Woodlawn Cemetery.
He died in 1878.
We've repped the Howard Hinkel Endowment for decades.
Pretty cutthroat environment around here, no?
Forrest have any rivals for this corner office?
Nobody here resented Peter's success.
He earned it.
What about outside the firm?
Clients?
People in his personal life?
Uh, we can't give out confidential information about our clients without a court order.
You understand.
Sure.
We understand.
So, could you just supply us with a list of personnel?
Of course.
Mr. Burrell?
I, uh... noticed from the photo you and Peter go way back.
We're gonna do our best on this one.
Look, there was an... an incident with a client about a month ago.
He was heavily overexposed in the housing market.
Ignored Peter's advice, really chased returns.
When the bubble burst, he got hurt, pretty badly.
And he blamed Peter.
He threatened to kill Peter.
Sydney, you wanna walk these guys
- down to personnel?
- Sure.
You got a name for me?
Brezner.
Isaac Brezner.
Thank you.
Isaac, we need you over here.
Drape it like this.
Ugh!
Five minutes.
Yes, I threatened to kill Peter Forrest.
The guy lost me millions.
I also threatened to kill my assistant when he wore Tommy Hilfiger to my niece's bat mitzvah.
So?
Where were you yesterday afternoon?
Front row at Stella McCartney.
So you'll be in the pictures.
I already am.
Check online.
You guys should be looking for a jealous boyfriend.
The number of girls Peter was chasing?
He was a fixture at my show.
Brought his colleagues backstage to meet the models.
You know how many times I got those guys laid?
No.
How many times?
You are aware that the victim was married.
It's okay, honey.
So was I.
Yeah, his alibi checks out.
He was front row at the show.
Is that a fur suit?
Yeah, I could imagine offing Forrest.
If I was his wife.
Ah, this operation's a trifle loaded for you, huh, Detective?
Okay.
All right, wife just surfaced.
Al and Carrie are headed over to her now.
Forrest sure liked his views.
He's not the only one.
I hear you and Elaine are looking in the city.
Thinking about it.
I always knew there was an uptown guy underneath those trucker hats and bowling shirts.
What bowling shirts?
"Talent to Spare," "Shut Up and Bowl."
Whatever happened to that one?
You gave it to a kid who scored a six-bagger on his 14th birthday.
- Did I?
- Yep.
July 17, 1999.
Old Galaxy Lanes on Erie Boulevard.
It was a Saturday night.
I'm impressed.
Wild guess.
It's okay.
Not a bad thing.
Hey, guys.
What have you got?
Why do you have a glass rabbit on your bookshelf?
Why?
Where should it be?
- And it's a hare.
- It has hair?
No, it's...
Look, until you agree to move in with me, you have no right to question my decor.
Now I'm in trouble.
I'm serious.
What do you think?
I think the hare looks really great where it is.
So Brezner's not our guy.
Nah, doesn't look like it.
Let's, uh...
let's not say any more than we have to at this point.
So that was the last time you saw your husband?
On Sunday?
I left for my conference the next morning.
Where was the conference?
Hartford.
In the Hilton.
- So you were separated?
- Yes.
He was living at the apartment in Queens.
But we were patching things up.
We were even talking about him moving back in.
Why'd you two split up?
Neither of us came from money.
I worked to pay the bills while he got his degree, and then he did the same for me.
Then he got the job at Sims Bennett.
It was the height of the Internet thing.
All the jet-setting, crazy hours, sleeping around.
All of it.
But you guys were, uh, working things out?
About three months ago, Peter came to me and said he was really turning his life around.
He'd started to take on charities.
He even went to therapy.
He begged me to give him another chance.
So, as far as you know, there was no one else?
Why are you asking me this?
So sorry, Mrs. Forrest.
We just have to consider the possibility that someone didn't want to see you reconciled.
Yes.
Okay.
There was one.
She'd call here in the middle of the night sometimes.
I heard Peter yell at her to leave us alone.
He told me that he would take care of it.
Do you think that this woman...
We don't know.
All right, wife's in the clear.
According to the conference director,
Allison Forrest was moderating panels the whole morning of the murder.
Maybe they were on the mend.
If Peter Forrest reformed himself, I want more evidence.
I got some.
Turns out Allison was telling the truth about those calls they were getting.
They trace back to the Sims Bennett office extension of one Claire Hewson.
She was an assistant in Forrest's department.
Was?
They let her go three weeks ago.
That's around the time
- the calls started.
- Guy's a saint.
Goes back to the wife, fires the girlfriend.
And gives her two very good reasons to want revenge.
It gets better.
Hewson was picked up on a DWI two days ago.
Arresting found her passed out in her car.
Check out the address.
Hunter's Point.
She was in front of Forrest's building.
Where he was killed less than 24 hours later.
How long was she in custody?
Only a few hours.
She posted bail and was released the next morning.
Sohe got out in time to kill Forrest.
Police.
We have a search warrant.
Ms. Hewson?
Check the bedroom.
I got a body.
Clear!
She's dead.
Two through the chest.
Same shooter?
Maybe.
We got a dead husband, dead girlfriend.
And a wife whose alibi checks out.
Wife's rich.
Maybe someone does it for her.
Her hygienist.
They're all evil.
Not when you brush.
Maybe this is what put her over the edge.
"Dearest Claire, forgive me.
Be mine forever.
P."
I don't get it.
Now he's proposing to her?
I don't want to say anything, but...
Restores your faith in the unfaithful?
Well, Claire wasn't wearing the ring, so maybe she's not sold on the idea.
Follow up with the jeler...
let's make sure
Forrest really bought this ring.
Mr. District Attorney.
- How are you?
- Good.
Good to see you.
I'm glad you came by.
Who's that...
Gilroy?
Boy Wonder himself.
Al's pretty good with him.
Yeah, I can see that.
So we're thinking from the note and the ring,
Forrest was still at it with the Hewson girl.
We're just following up with the jeweler now.
We looked into the wrong account at Sims Bennett.
Can you hold on a sec?
It's okay.
What do you have, Detective?
It wasn't "HH"
on the file box in Forrest's apartment.
It was "HYH." Come here.
I want you to look at this.
When I was in Forrest's apartment, I couldn't see that box of files he was shredding clearly.
Right?
So I missed that there was a letter between the two H's.
I'm confused.
I thought our crime scene blew up.
No...
Detective Wells was able to examine the scene briefly.
I see.
Right.
So, like I was saying,
I think we looked into the wrong account.
Can you give us a moment?
Can I talk to you?
- Why are we over here?
- Because I'd rather keep the scope of our investigation at this point to ourselves until...
- Until what?
- Until we're ready to present it coherently to our ADA.
Was I not being coherent?
Because I can speak slower.
Carrie, what you can do and how it can help, in terms of actually building a case,
- from their perspective...
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
You didn't tell them, did you?
They know you're a great detective.
They saw your numbers in Syracuse.
Why did you bring me in here and not tell them what I do?
Because it's hard at first for people to accept.
Come on, you race up, you haven't even met Gilroy yet, you're throwing out stuff from left field.
That could help solve this case, Al.
If I was the prosecutor, I would want to know that information.
All Adam Gilroy wants to know is that he can stand in front of a microphone and assure a bunch of nervous real estate developers that Hunter's Point is going to be the next Sutton Place.
I got it.
You have to hustle the front office.
That's your job.
But don't stop me from doing mine.
I thought you guys never got into Forrest's place.
Yeah, well, uh, I guess Wells had a look around.
A look around?
And she's picking out file names?
What can I say?
She's observant.
We want to stop our kids from making the same mistakes we did.
And we can make a difference one life at a time.
What do you got?
Help Your Homies.
HYH.
It's a charity that helps gang members get back on their feet after they get out of prison.
Peter Forrest set up their nonprofit status and managed their money.
Oh, one of his life crisis projects.
And Claire Hewson assisted Forrest on the account.
Strange thing about your Homies account is that Forrest closed it three days ago.
Where'd the money go?
That's a good question.
Maybe he had his hand in the till.
Could've been looking to set up a new life with Claire.
Yeah, stealing from ex-gangbangers... that's a good way to end your old life.
I think it's time we talk to the Head Homie.
That's the fun part.
The guy who runs the charity is doing 25 to life upstate.
- Come again.
- Pablo Hortua.
He's in prison.
Got brothers coming to me all the time saying, "Pablo, I want to change," you know?
They don't have the means to do anything about it.
So they're out there slinging again, and bam, their asses wind up right back in here.
So me and Ramon, we say to ourselves,
"Hey, look, man, we got to break this cycle."
Maybe it's too late for us, but for those other eses, it's not too late for them.
- It's impressive.
- It's working.
Brothers are turning their lives around.
And our boy, Peter Forrest... he was taking our operation to a whole nother level.
How'd you... how'd you guys hook up with Peter?
Well, we reached out to him after I read about him and some cancer charity...
you know, how he was using their money to make more money.
You know, to get respect money, real money.
Money to make a change, money to lobby politicians.
You know, I figured he could do the same for us.
And yet your relationship with Forrest ended recently.
How come?
Our boy couldn't come up with the time he thought we needed.
So he recommended we hire somebody who'd give us their full attention.
So you moved your funds elsewhere?
Peter got us a new bank, yeah.
You confirm Forrest did this?
That the money's there?
Man, what do you think?
Yes, I know what the agreement says.
Have Mike follow the money.
Make sure this bank transfer happened the way they say.
I'll bring her to you Sunday.
You know, if this was a dead end, I'm sorry.
If it's a dead end, you're fired.
Come on, she's perfectly safe with me.
So it checks out.
The Homies' funds are accounted for.
Peter Forrest just moved them to another bank.
He didn't steal a cent.
So we're back to the wife.
See if there's another angle.
For all we know, there's an overprotective cousin out there.
Not sure we need that.
I went to the jeweler.
Get this.
Forrest isn't the one who bought Claire that ring.
That's Marine Sergeant Patrick Woodson.
He was Hewson's ex-boyfriend.
A salesgirl says he was talking her ear off about how he just got back from Afghanistan, was going to surprise Claire with the ring.
So Sergeant Woodson comes home and pops the question, then finds out that his girlfriend has been doing Peter Forrest the whole time he's been flying solo in Kandahar.
So he loses it, kills her, drives across town and pops Forrest.
Yeah.
Nice little detail:
Woodson was dishonorably discharged three weeks ago.
Pulled a gun on a superior officer.
So you went straight from the airport to the jewelry store, huh?
- I made up my mind.
- So then what, Patrick?
You proposed?
The next day, I took her to the park.
There's a spot by the pond.
It's where we had our first date.
I was going to do it there before I deployed, but, God forbid something happened to me, I...
I didn't want her to have to live with that.
Sure.
So what'd she say?
She said she needed more time.
Time for what?
Stand-up guy like you.
What did she need time for?
No, it...
it was okay.
I didn't want to rush her into anything.
So Claire needed time.
Yeah.
But then you knew something wasn't right.
So, what, you started looking into it, watching after her a little?
No.
I wasn't watching her.
Right, 'cause you were out in Jersey all week playing video games at your squad-mate's apartment.
Yeah.
So then how'd you find out that Claire had been seeing this other guy?
What other guy?
You were out in Jersey for those two days?
- What other guy?
- Anybody else see you there?
Was your squad-mate at home?
You think I shot Claire?
No, we're just talking here, Patrick.
Not anymore.
I want a lawyer.
So I talked to
Woodson's squad-mate, the one he's bunking with... kid works nights in Hoboken at the CH Ice Cream factory.
I love their sweet cream.
Yeah, well, sweeter still, that means Woodson's alibi sleeps all day.
Lousy alibi doesn't put him at our murder scene.
Not that it matters, but we got Forrest's watch.
In case you were wondering, a Patek Philippe.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Also got this from the Arson Squad.
They're saying the leak started in the hallway, two floors above
Peter Forrest's apartment.
Two floors above the murder scene?
Why whack someone then head upstairs to start a gas leak?
Doesn't make any sense.
Yeah, it does.
The 911 call came in at 2:13 p.m.
At 2:19, the uniformsre on the scene.
They were close.
You think the fast response time trapped our killer in the building?
There's only one stairwell, right?
He goes up, got no way out.
So he starts a gas leak, uses the crowd to get out.
Smart.
You and I were going into that building while people were leaving.
I know.
I don't see Woodson.
Are you absolutely sure?
Come on everybody.
Oh, my God.
That doesn't make any sense.
Ramon Garza was there.
The guy from the charity?
Al, he walked right by us.
That's impossible;
he's in prison.
I know he's in prison, but I-I know what I saw.
He was there.
Could you be mixing two memories?
No.
I saw him there.
I did.
He's behind bars, Carrie.
I know that, but I saw him.
I'm tell...
I hear you're liking the Marine.
How close are we?
Woodson's fading a little, Adam.
Lousy alibi, but nothing puts him at either scene.
Thought we had prints from the girl's place.
Yeah, but they were together, and he admits being over there.
We have an alternative theory.
- Another suspect?
- We're considering several...
Yes, we have another suspect.
Who would that be?
Ramon Garza.
And is this the same Ramon Garza you interviewed concerning the Homies charity?
Yes.
The Ramon Garza who is an inmate at the maximum security facility at Ossining?
Yes.
He was exiting Forrest's building the day of the murder.
And you know this how?
Because I saw him there.
What is this, Burns?
Detective Wells remembers passing Ramon Garza as he left the crime scene.
I would say, at the moment, that makes him our primary suspect.
I'm supposed to tell my boss that the guy we're looking at for these murders is currently serving 25 to life?
That's what I'm telling you.
What you tell your boss is up to you.
How about this.
How about I don't tell Mr. Fleming anything right now, and before we go to trial, you come up with a real suspect.
That way, we both keep our jobs.
Keep up the good work.
Well...
Have a good night, Halsey.
See you tomorrow.
Officer Halsey.
Hey.
Uh, Carr...
Detective Wells.
We met the other day.
Oh, yeah.
How's it going?
Good.
You got a sec?
Uh, now's a little tough.
I got somewhere to be.
Please, just...
it'll only take a minute.
I just, I don't want to have to drive all the way up here again.
So, you know Ramon Garza, right?
Sure, everyone does.
Regular Mother Theresa in there.
Right.
And you're C.O. number 046?
Yeah.
Your corrections sergeant...
he told me you're the one who's generally responsible for doing the daily inmate checks.
A real privilege.
Yeah.
And that day before yesterday, you were the one who accounted for Ramon Garza's cell check.
If that's what the file says.
Right.
No, it's just...
do you actually remember seeing him here that day?
I count hundreds of inmates.
Oh, I'm sure.
No, I get it.
I was just, I was wondering if maybe there's a way...
I don't know...
the inmates can game the system.
You know, have one guy call out "here" for another guy when his name comes up, something like that.
It's not kindergarten.
We put eyes on every inmate, verify it's them.
So Ramon Garza...
he was definitely here that day?
Where the hell else would he be?
Beats me.
I was just...
Yeah, you're right.
Okay.
Uh, well, thank you for your time.
I appreciate it.
No problem.
Yeah.
Halsey got Ramon Garza out of prison, drove him to shoot Peter Forrest and Claire Hewson, then drove him back to prison.
Okay, if Garza got out of prison, why would he go back?
I mean, guy's doing life for murder.
All I know is he was back inside by the time you and I got there, Al.
Hey, springing an inmate full-time ain't easy, even for a guard.
So we're back to the Homies?
I don't know...
the... the victim didn't steal their money.
No, but he did see their financials.
Which might not have been so healthy.
I just got off with the DEA.
This Homies charity was on the up and up until Pablo took over a couple years ago.
Now they're looking at them for money laundering.
Cartel out of Mexico.
So Forrest decides to do something good with his life.
Right?
Manage a charity account.
Only it turns out he's hooked into a criminal enterprise.
Yeah, and when he tries to get out, blammo.
Dirty charities, corrupt prison guards... how do we make any of that stick?
We could go after the inmates, right?
We don't need, uh, warrants to toss their cells.
If we go to the prison, we'd be tipping off any other guards who might be involved.
Okay, so we go at this Halsey.
As you've told me many times before, Al, my memory's not going to get us a warrant.
Yeah, not from Gilroy.
Gilroy's not running this investigation.
I am.
Let's bring in Halsey.
- So it looks like our Mr.
- Forrest was trying to clean up his act after all.
Whatever.
What is her deal with men anyway?
Okay, so... two years ago, Nina meets this guy, bound trader for Goldman, heartbreaker like Forrest.
We're talking restaurants in the city, weekends in the Hamptons, cruises to Saint something-or-other.
I mean, she fell hard.
Like, "planning home for the holidays" hard.
So, when she goes by his place one day for lunch to get his shirt sized for a Christmas surprise, she gets her own surprise.
Oh.
Guy's in there with two waitresses from the Oyster Bar.
And he's doing a little, uh...
bonding of another kind.
Just to, you know, put it in context.
Yeah, yeah.
Our eyewitness puts you outside
Peter Forrest's apartment day he was killed.
I don't know who that is.
You shot a guy you don't even know?
I didn't shoot anybody.
So you're telling us
Ramon Garza was the shooter?
Oh, yeah.
We know you faked the inmate count, drove Garza down here...
So, if it was Garza that popped Forrest, now is the time to say so.
You're going to be real popular upstate.
A former prison guard?
I got nothing to say.
I don't get it.
Why isn't he asking for his lawyer?
Or his union rep?
He knows all he's got to do is say the word and we can't talk to him anymore.
Got his phone records.
Nothing overt.
Bunch of calls to a foot doctor, cable company, few to his ex-wife.
How much they pay you to betray your badge, Officer?
Ex-wife?
Yeah, up in Yonkers.
They got a couple kids.
Yes, I know what the agreement says.
Have Mike follow the money.
Make sure this bank transfer happened the way they say.
I'll bring her to you Sunday.
I'll bring her to you Sunday.
Come on.
She's perfectly safe with me.
He's not scared for his own life.
Detectives.
Hey, Dennis.
How's it going?
- Great.
- Yeah?
You want something?
Uh, water, a soda?
I wanna get outta here, how's that?
That's fine by me.
You're a corrections officer, Dennis.
You know all you have to do is ask for a lawyer, and we're history.
You know that.
So, you want a lawyer?
I don't need a lawyer.
No?
Where's your daughter, Dennis?
Is she safe at your house, like your ex-wife thinks she is?
I don't think so.
I think she's in a lot of trouble.
All right, look, we'll just get you a lawyer, okay?
If word gets out that you're in here talking to us, then...
No.
I can't.
I can't.
They have Anna.
My daughter.
They'll kill her.
I was supposed to get her back tonight, but they must have seen you, in the parking lot.
And they got worried I'd talk.
They said I'd get Anna back once you stopped sniffing around.
Oh, my God, if Pablo finds out I'm in here...
Dennis, we're gonna get her back, but you got to help us out.
Who would they go to for something like this?
Another guard maybe...?
No way.
He woulda used one of his boys.
After you left, Pablo got a visit from this kid, Ignacio,
I think, from his charity, I never seen him before.
Ignacio?
We want to stop our kids from making the same mistakes we did.
And we can make a difference, one life at a time.
Ignacio Rodriguez?
Yeah, maybe.
Police!
Freeze, Ignacio, down!
Anna, it's okay.
We're here to help you.
All right?
You're safe now.
Put your arms around my neck, sweetie... up you go.
Okay.
All right, come on.
Ramon Garza, you're under arrest for the murders of Peter Forrest and Claire Hewson.
¿Que onda, heina?
You need more help with your investigation?
Nah.
I think I'm good now.
Let's see you run your gang from solitary.
On the night of October 12,
I drove Ramon Garza to the address of Peter Forrest in Hunter's Point, Queens.
I also drove Garza to the address of Claire Hewson on October 11.
He told us Garza sent him to dump about a dozen guns into the Hudson.
We have divers out at the site right now.
And that's not to mention the other guards he named, apparently on their payroll.
Nice job, Al.
Everyone.
Really good work.
You got a sec, Detective?
Sure.
I checked around.
Your friend Al called in a few favors to bring you here.
So, what's the verdict?
Am I worth it?
I look forward to working with you, Detective.
Hey...
What did he want?
I'm not sure.
Well, if you're not sure, that's not good.
Big city politics, right?
Who knows?
Maybe I'll get used to it.
You did.
So... what'd you decide about the apartment?
What, 76th and Madison?
You got the Park right there, the Whitney...
Nah, neighborhood's not really my style.
Really?
Yeah, looking for something closer to work.
Oh.
More practical.
What was I thinking?
Hey.
Hey.
So, you, uh...
you figure it out?
What, this love stuff?
Yeah.
Me?
Yeah, I'm outta this game.
Wow, that guy must've been a real winner, huh?
Oh, man, wait, did Roe say something to you?
Because I know you can't remember my life.
You know, if you think about it, and it's true, and he really loved her, it's almost too sad.
Then don't think about it.
Night.
You sure you can't stay?
No, I gotta work early.
So what do you do?
Are we really asking that now?
You free on Friday?
No.
Saturday?
Nope.
You sure there's nobody else?
Mm-mm.
Just me.
Okay.
Bye.
Tom.
Yeah.
Right.
You remember.
Excuse me.
Have we met?
- Never.
- Are you sure?
- I'm really good with faces.
- Me too.
Sorry.
- Totally timing yourself.
- Yeah.
So choosing this moment to come over here and ask you out epic fail, right?
Maybe.
Maybe not.
I'm Tom.
- Wow, really?
- Carrie Wells.
What's the location?
I'm on my way.
So Carrie Wells.
Two questions.
Are you single?
And can I have your number?
Yes, and why don't I take yours?
Yeah, sure.
Borrow a pen?
Don't need a pen.
I'll remember.
- What do we got?
- We got a fresh one up on the fourth.
- Where's Al?
- He's coming in from the city.
He and Elaine were looking at apartments uptown.
Al hit the lotto with her.
How do I land a girl with a trust fund?
- Try brushing your teeth.
- Right, so the vic is in apartment 4B says the place is rented to a Peter Forrest.
Hey.
Sorry, tunnel was a mess, what'd I miss?
Neighbours heard shots, factory condo conversion, about 40 units.
Victim's on the 4th floor.
- We're headed in now.
- What are they doing here?
Mike, get with the building super.
Get a list of residents, security footage.
- I'm on it.
- Nina, Roe, catch up out here.
Carrie, with me.
Folks, keep on coming.
You're going the wrong way.
- N.Y.P.D., I got a body up there.
- Doesn't matter, there's a gas leak.
- We're getting everybody out.
- Down the steps, guys.
You have a chance to examine the scene?
No, they're on their way out and so are you.
- Crime scene.
- You can examine after we turn off the gas.
Hey, Joey, Kevin, help this woman out.
- Come on, guys, let's go.
- Yes, sir.
Clear out, everybody, get out of here!
We can't shut off the gas!
Carrie?
Turn around.
Everybody, clear out.
Carrie, come on, it's gonna blow.
No joke.
They can't shut off the gas, we gotta go.
- I'm--
- Now!
Everybody out!
Come on, it's gonna blow!
Hey.
What part of evacuate don't you under--?
- You guys all right?
- Yeah, we're fine.
Looks like we got a corrupted crime scene.
No, it's okay.
I got it.
There were powder burns on his shirt.
No, he fell the other way, that way.
Yeah, that's it there.
The victim was lying about 10 feet from the door.
He was shot twice in the chest at close range.
There were no signs of a struggle.
And no forced entry.
- I think we got something.
- Hit me.
The 116th has been working a string of robbery-homicides.
Similar pattern, upscale buildings, no doorman vics robbed at the front door.
- Anyone shot?
- This wasn't a robbery.
Well, he still had his watch on.
- Patek Philippe.
- Maybe the perp panicked.
Never made it inside.
You were in there for like, what, 30 seconds?
Just under.
All we're saying is, this could line up with the other pop and grabs.
See if it does, talk to the 116th.
And get with the Arson Squad.
This gas leak is pretty convenient.
Peter Forrest, age 42.
- Good-looking guy.
- DMV lists a home address on Fifth Avenue.
So, what's our murder scene, second apartment?
We could ask the wife, Allison Forrest, same address.
Lease has him as vice president with Sims Bennett Brokerage
That explains the second apartment.
All those Wall Street guys, total players.
Hey, maybe the guy just needed a quiet place to, you know, meditate.
That what you call it now?
Did you say Sims Bennett?
Someone was shredding Sims Bennett files.
There's an account label.
- Can you see what it was?
- My view's kind of blocked, it--
It looks like the initials H-H.
He's shredding when he gets it maybe this H.H. account's the reason why.
Nina, Roe, find me the wife already.
Carrie, Mike, let's get over to Forrest's office.
Thank you.
That would be very helpful.
- Who's he talking to?
- My guess?
District attorney.
High-profile victim, gas explosion.
We have all the resources we need.
Sure thing, counsellor.
We'll keep you in the loop, thank you.
- Gilroy?
- Who else?
The guy grabs any case might make the evening news.
Forrest sure lived the high life.
Isn't that Pebble Beach?
- Greens fees, what, 500 a head?
- Is that a Formula 1 fantasy camp?
Bailout dollars at work.
Detective, I'm Sydney Burrell.
I worked closely with Peter.
This is Gary Wright, general counsel.
Did you work closely with Peter too?
Our policy is to have counsel present for any legal enquiry regarding an employee.
Yeah, our policy is to find out who killed him.
And to that end only H.H. account we can find is Howard Hinkel's.
It was one of Peter's oldest accounts.
Any reason it has something to do with him being killed?
I can't think of any.
- Do you know where we can find him?
- Woodlawn Cemetery.
He died in 1878.
We've repped the Howard Hinkel Endowment for decades.
Pretty cutthroat environment around here, no?
Forrest have any rivals for this corner office?
Nobody here resented Peter's success.
He earned it.
- What about outside the firm?
- Clients, people in his personal life?
We can't give out confidential information about clients without a court order.
- You understand.
- Sure.
We understand.
So could you just supply us with a list of personnel?
Of course.
Mr. Burrell?
I noticed from the photo you and Peter go way back.
We're gonna do our best on this one.
Look, there was an incident with a client about a month ago.
He was over-exposed in the housing market.
Ignored Peter's advice, really chased returns.
When the bubble burst, he got hurt, pretty badly.
And he blamed Peter.
- He threatened to kill Peter.
- Sydney, wanna walk these guys...
- ...down to Personnel?
- Sure.
You got a name for me?
- Brezner.
Issac Brezner.
- Thank you.
- Issac, we need you over here.
- Drape it like this.
Five minutes.
Yes, I threatened to kill Peter Forrest.
The guy lost me millions.
I threatened my assistant when he wore Tommy Hilfiger to my niece's bat mitzvah.
So?
- Where were you yesterday afternoon?
- Front row at Stella McCartney.
- So you'll be in the pictures?
- I already am.
Check online.
You should be looking for a jealous boyfriend.
The number of girls Peter was chasing?
He was a fixture at my show.
Brought his colleagues back to meet the models.
Know how many times I got them laid?
No, how many times?
You are aware that the victim was married?
It's okay, honey, so was I.
Yeah, his alibi checks out.
He was front row at the show.
- Is that a fur suit?
- Yeah, I could imagine offing Forrest.
If I was his wife.
This operation's a trifle loaded for you, huh, detective?
Okay.
All right, the wife just surfaced.
Al and Carrie are headed over to her now.
Forrest sure liked his views.
He's not the only one.
I hear you and Elaine are looking in the city.
Thinking about it.
I knew there was an uptown guy under those trucker hats and bowling shirts.
- What bowling shirts?
- "Talent to spare," "Shut up and bowl."
Whatever happened to that one?
You gave it to a kid who scored a six-bagger on his 1 4th birthday.
- Did I?
- Yep.
July 1 7th, 1999.
- Old Galaxy Lanes on Erie Boulevard.
- It was a Saturday night.
I'm impressed.
- Wild guess.
- Yeah.
It's okay.
Not a bad thing.
What do you got?
Why do you have a rabbit on your shelf?
Why, where should it be?
And it's a hare.
- It has hair?
- No, it's....
Look, until you agree to move in with me...
- ...you've no right to question my decor.
- Now I'm in trouble.
I'm serious.
What do you think?
I think the hare looks really great where it is.
- So Brezner's not our guy?
- No, it doesn't look like it.
Let's not say any more than we have to at this point.
So that was the last time you saw your husband?
On Sunday?
I left for my conference the next morning.
Where was the conference?
Hartford.
The Hilton.
So you were separated?
Yes, he was living at the apartment in Queens.
But we were patching things up.
We were even talking about him moving back in.
Why'd you two split up?
Neither of us came from money.
I worked to pay the bills while he got his degree and then he did the same for me.
Then he got the job at Sims Bennett height of the Internet thing.
All the jet-setting, crazy hours, sleeping around.
All of it.
But you guys were working things out?
About three months ago Peter came to me and said he was really turning his life around.
He'd started to take on charities even went to therapy.
He begged me to give him another chance.
So as far as you know, there was no one else?
- Why are you asking me this?
- I'm so sorry, Mrs. Forrest.
We just have to consider the possibility that someone didn't want to see you reconciled.
Yes, okay.
There was one.
She'd call here, in the middle of the night sometimes.
I heard Peter yell at her to leave us alone.
He told me that he would take care of it.
Do you think that this woman...?
We don't know.
Wife's in the clear.
According to the conference director Allison was moderating panels...
- ...morning of the murder.
- Maybe they were on the mend.
If Peter Forrest reformed himself, I want more evidence.
I got some.
Turns out Allison was telling the truth about those calls.
They trace back to the Sims Bennett office extension of one Claire Hewson.
She was an assistant in Forrest's department.
- Was?
- They let her go three weeks ago.
- Around the time the calls started.
- A saint.
Back to wife, fires girlfriend.
And gives her two very good reasons to want revenge.
It gets better.
Hewson was picked up on a DWI two days ago.
Arresting found her passed out in a car.
Check out the address.
Hunter's Point.
She was in front of Forrest's building.
Where he was killed less than 24 hours later.
- How long was she in custody?
- Only a few hours.
Posted bail, released the next morning.
So she got out in time to kill Forrest.
Police!
We have a search warrant.
Ms. Hewson?
Check the bedroom.
- I got a body.
- Clear!
Clear.
She's dead.
- Two to the chest.
Same shooter?
- Maybe.
We got a dead husband, dead girlfriend.
- And a wife whose alibi checks out.
- Wife's rich.
Someone does it for her.
- Her hygienist.
They're all evil.
- Not when you brush.
Maybe this is what put her over the edge.
"Dearest Claire, forgive me.
Be mine forever.
P."
I don't get it, now he's proposing?
- I don't wanna say anything--
- Restores your faith in the unfaithful?
Well, Claire wasn't wearing the ring so maybe she's not sold on the idea.
Follow up with the jeweller.
Let's make sure Forrest really bought this ring.
- Mr. District Attorney.
How are you?
- Good.
Good to see you.
- Who's that?
Gilroy?
- Boy wonder himself.
Al's pretty good with him.
Yeah, I can see that.
So we're thinking from the note and the ring Forrest is still at it with the Hewson girl.
Wife's alibi cleared.
We're following up with the jeweller now.
We looked into the wrong account.
- Hold on a sec.
- It's okay.
- What do you have, detective?
- It wasn't H.H on the file box in Forrest's apartment it was "H.Y.H." Come here, I want you to look at this.
In Forrest's apartment, I couldn't see that box of files he was shredding.
So I missed that there was a letter between the two H's.
I'm confused.
I thought our crime scene blew up.
- No--
- Detective Wells was able to examine the scene briefly.
- I see.
- Right.
So like I was saying, I think we looked into the wrong account.
Will you give us a moment?
Can I talk to you?
- Why are we here?
- I'd rather keep the scope of our investigation at this point to ourselves.
Until--
- Till?
- We're ready to present coherently to our ADA.
Was I not being coherent?
Because I can speak slower.
Carrie, what you can do, and how it can help in terms of actually building a case...
- ...from their perspective--
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, you didn't tell them, did you?
They know you're a great detective.
They saw your numbers in Syracuse.
Why did you bring me in here and not tell them what I do?
Because it's hard, at first, for people to accept.
You race up haven't met Gilroy, throwing out stuff...
- ...from left field--
- To help solve this, Al.
If I was the prosecutor, I would wanna know that.
All Adam Gilroy wants is to stand in front of a microphone and assure real estate developers Hunter's Point is gonna be Sutton Place.
I got it.
You have to hustle the front office, that's your job.
But don't stop me from doing mine.
I thought you guys never got into Forrest's place.
Yeah, well, I guess Wells had a look around.
A look around?
And she's picking out file names?
What can I say?
She's observant.
We wanna stop our kids from making the same mistakes we did.
And we can make a difference, one life at a time.
What do you got?
"Help Your Homeys.
H.Y.H."
It's a charity that helps gang members get on their feet after prison.
Peter Forrest set up their non-profit status and managed their money.
One of his life crisis projects.
And Claire Hewson assisted Forrest on the account.
Strange thing about your Homeys account is that Forrest closed it.
- Where'd the money go?
- Maybe he had his hand in the till.
To set up a new life with Claire.
Stealing from ex gang-bangers?
A good way to end your old life.
- It's time we talk to the head homey.
- That's the fun part.
The guy who runs the charity is doing 25-to-life upstate.
- Come again?
- Pablo Hortua.
He's in prison.
I got brothers coming to me saying:
"Pablo, I wanna change, you know?"
They don't have the means to do anything.
So they're out there slinging and bam their asses wind up right back in here.
Me and Ramon, we say to ourselves, "Gotta break this cycle."
Maybe it's too late for us.
But for those other éses, it's not too late for them.
- It's impressive.
- It's working.
Brothers are turning their lives around.
And our boy, Peter Forrest he was taking our operation to a whole another level.
How'd you guys hook up with Peter?
We reached out to him after I read about him and some cancer charity.
How he was using their money to make more money.
To get respect money.
Money to make a change.
Money to lobby politicians.
I figured he could do the same for us.
And yet, your relationship with Forrest ended recently.
How come?
Couldn't come up with time he thought we needed.
So he recommended we hire somebody who could give us full attention.
So you moved your funds elsewhere?
Peter got us a new bank, yeah.
You confirm Forrest did this?
- That the money's there?
- Man, what do you think?
Have Mike follow the money.
Make sure this bank transfer happened the way they say.
- I'll bring her to you Sunday.
- If this was a dead end, I'm sorry.
If it's a dead end, you're fired.
So it checks out.
The Homeys funds are accounted for.
Forrest moved them to another bank, didn't steal a cent.
So we're back to the wife.
See if there's another angle.
For all we know, there's an overprotective cousin.
Not sure we need that.
I went to the jeweller.
Get this, Forrest isn't the one who bought Claire that ring.
That's Marine Sergeant Patrick Woodson.
He was Hewson's ex-boyfriend.
Salesgirl says he was talking about how he just got back from Afghanistan.
Was gonna surprise Claire with the ring.
So Sergeant Woodson comes home, pops the question finds out his girlfriend's doing Forrest the whole time he's been flying solo in Kandahar.
So he loses it.
Kills her drives cross-town and pops Forrest.
One detail, Woodson was dishonourably discharged three weeks ago.
Pulled a gun on a superior officer.
From the airport to the jewellery store, huh?
- I made up my mind.
- So then what, Patrick?
You proposed?
The next day, I took her to the park.
There's a spot by the pond, it's where we had our first date.
I was gonna do it before I deployed but God forbid something happened to me.
I didn't want her to live with that.
Sure.
So, what did she say?
She said she needed more time.
Time?
Stand-up guy like you.
What's she need time for?
No, it was okay.
I didn't wanna rush her into anything.
- So Claire needed time.
- Yeah.
You knew something wasn't right.
So, what, you started looking into it watching after her a little?
- No.
I wasn't watching her.
- You were out in Jersey all week playing games at your mate's apartment.
Yeah.
How'd you find out she had been seeing this other guy?
- What other guy?
- You were out in Jersey those two days?
- What guy?
- Anybody see you there?
Was your squad-mate at home?
You think I shot Claire?
No, we're just talking here, Patrick.
Not anymore.
I want a lawyer.
So I talked to Woodson's squad-mate, the one he's bunking with?
Kid works nights in Hoboken at the CH Ice Cream factory.
I love their sweet-cream.
Yeah, sweeter still, that means Woodson's alibi sleeps all day.
Lousy alibi doesn't put him at our murder scene.
Not that it matters, but we got Forrest's watch.
In case you were wondering, a Patek Philippe.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Also got this, from the Arson Squad saying the leak started in the hallway two floors above Peter Forrest's apartment.
Two floors above the murder scene?
Why whack someone, head up to start a gas leak?
- Doesn't make any sense.
- Yeah, it does.
The 911 call came in at 2:13 p.m.
At 2:19, the uniforms were on the scene.
They were closed.
You think the fast response time trapped our killer?
There's only one stairwell, right?
He goes up, got no way out.
So he starts a gas leak uses the crowd to get out.
Smart.
You and I were going into that building while people were leaving.
I know.
- I don't see Woodson.
- Are you absolutely sure?
Move it along, everybody.
Oh, my God.
Move it along, everybody.
That doesn't make any sense.
Ramon Garza was there.
What?
The guy from the charity?
Al, he walked right by us.
That's impossible, he's in prison.
I know he's in prison, but I know what I saw.
He was there.
- Could you be mixing two memories?
- No.
I saw him there, I did.
- He's behind bars, Carrie.
- I know that, but I saw him.
I hear you're liking the Marine.
How close are we?
Woodson's fading a little, Adam.
Lousy alibi, but nothing puts him at either scene.
Thought we had prints from the girl's place.
They were together, he admits being over there.
- We have an alternative theory.
- Another suspect?
- Yes, we have another suspect.
- We're considering several--
Who would that be?
Ramon Garza.
And is this the same Ramon Garza you interviewed...
- ...concerning the Homeys charity?
- Yes.
The Ramon Garza who is an inmate at the maximum-security facility at Ossining?
Yes.
He was exiting Forrest's building the day of the murder.
And you know this how?
Because I saw him there.
What is this, Burns?
Detective Wells remembers passing Ramon Garza as he left the crime scene.
I would say at the moment, that makes him our primary suspect.
I'm supposed to tell my boss that the guy we're looking at is currently serving 25-to-life?
That's what I'm telling you.
What you tell your boss is up to you.
How about this?
How about I don't tell Mr. Fleming anything right now and before we go to trial, you come up with a real suspect.
That way we both keep our jobs.
Keep up the good work.
Have a good night, Halsey.
See you tomorrow.
Officer Halsey?
Hey, Detective Wells, we met the other day?
- Oh, yeah.
How's it going?
- Good, you got a sec?
Now's a little tough, I got somewhere to be.
Please.
Just, it'll only take a minute.
I just don't wanna have to drive all the way up here again.
So you know Ramon Garza, right?
Sure, everyone does.
Regular Mother Teresa in there.
- Right.
And you're C.O. number 046?
- Yeah.
Your sergeant, he told me you're the one responsible for doing the daily inmate checks.
A real privilege.
That the day before yesterday you were the one who accounted for Ramon Garza's cell check?
- If that's what the file says.
- Right.
No, it's just do you actually remember seeing him here that day?
I count hundreds of inmates.
Oh, I'm sure.
No, I get it.
I was just wondering if maybe there's a way, I don't know the inmates can game the system you know, have one guy call out "here" for another when his name comes up?
It's not kindergarten.
We put eyes on every inmate.
Verify it's them.
Yeah.
So Ramon Garza, he was definitely here that day?
Where the hell else would he be?
Beats me.
I was just....
Yeah, you're right.
Okay.
Thank you for your time.
I appreciate it.
- No problem.
- Yeah.
Halsey got Ramon Garza out of prison drove him to shoot Peter Forrest and Hewson, drove him back to prison.
If Garza got out of prison, why would he go back?
Guy's doing life for murder.
All I know is he was back inside by the time we got there.
Springing an inmate full-time ain't easy, even for a guard.
So we're back to the Homeys?
The victim didn't steal their money.
- He did see their financials.
- Which might not have been healthy.
I got off with the DEA.
This Homeys charity was on the up and up until Pablo took over years ago.
Now they're looking at them for money laundering.
Cartel.
So Forrest decides to do something good with his life.
Right?
Manage a charity account.
Only it turns out, he's hooked into a criminal enterprise.
And when he tries to get out:
Dirty charities, corrupt guards.
How do we make that stick?
Go after the inmates.
We don't need warrants to toss their cells.
If we go to the prison, we'd be tipping off guards who might be involved.
Okay, so we go at this Halsey?
As you've told me many times before, my memory won't get us a warrant.
Not from Gilroy.
Gilroy's not running this investigation.
I am.
Let's bring in Halsey.
So looks like our Mr. Forrest was trying to clean up his act after all.
Whatever.
What is her deal with men anyway?
Okay, so two years ago, Nina meets this guy bond trader for Goldman, heartbreaker.
We're talking restaurants in the city, weekends in the Hamptons cruises to Saint-something-or-other.
I mean, she fell hard like "planning home for the holidays" hard.
So when she goes by his place one day for lunch to get his shirt size for a Christmas surprise she gets her own surprise.
Guy's in there with two waitresses from the Oyster Bar.
And he's doing a little bonding of another kind.
- Just to, you know, put it in context.
- Yeah, yeah.
Our eyewitness puts you outside Peter Forrest's apartment day he was killed.
- I don't know who that is.
- You shot a guy you don't even know?
I didn't shoot anybody.
So you're telling us Ramon Garza was the shooter?
Oh, yeah, we know you faked the inmate count drove Garza down here....
So if it was Garza that popped Forrest, now is the time to say so.
You're gonna be real popular upstate.
Former prison guard?
I got nothing to say.
I don't get it.
Why isn't he asking for his lawyer?
Or his union rep?
He knows all he's gotta do is say the word...
- ...and we can't talk to him.
- Hey.
Got his phone records.
Nothing overt.
Bunch of calls to a foot doctor, cable company, a few to his ex-wife.
How much did they pay you to betray your badge, officer?
Ex-wife?
Yeah, up in Yonkers.
They got a couple of kids.
There you go.
Have Mike follow the money.
Make sure this bank transfer happened the way they say.
I'll bring her to you Sunday.
I'll bring her to you Sunday.
Come on, she's perfectly safe with me.
He's not scared for his own life.
Detectives.
Hey, Dennis.
- How's it going?
- Great.
Yeah?
You want something?
- Water, soda?
- I wanna get out of here, how's that?
That's fine by me.
You're a corrections officer.
You know all you have to do is ask for a lawyer and we're history.
You know that.
So you want a lawyer?
Don't need a lawyer.
No?
Where's your daughter, Dennis?
Is she safe at your house, like your ex-wife thinks she is?
I don't think so.
I think she's in a lot of trouble.
All right, look, we'll just get you a lawyer, okay?
If word gets out that you're talking--
No.
I can't.
I can't.
They have Anna, my daughter.
They'll kill her.
I was supposed to get her back tonight but they must have seen you in the parking lot.
They got worried I'd talk.
They said I'd get Anna back once you stopped sniffing around.
Oh, my God, if Pablo finds out I'm in here--
Dennis, we're gonna get her back, but you gotta help us out.
Who would they go to for something like this?
Another guard maybe?
No way.
He would have used one of his boys.
After you left, Pablo got a visit from this kid, Ignacio.
I think from his charity.
I never seen him before.
Ignacio?
We wanna stop our kids from making the same mistakes we did.
And we can make a difference.
One life at a time.
- Ignacio Rodriguez?
- Yeah, maybe.
- Police!
Freeze, Ignacio, down!
- Police!
Check the bedroom!
Clear!
Anna?
It's okay, we're here to help you.
You're safe now.
I want you to put your arms around my neck, sweetheart.
Okay, all right.
Come on.
What's up, girlie?
Ramon Garza.
You're under arrest for the murders of Peter Forrest and Claire Hewson.
- Need help with your investigation?
- No.
I think I'm good now.
Let's see you run your gang from solitary.
On the night of October 1 2th I drove Ramon Garza to the address of Peter Forrest in Hunter's Point, Queens.
I also drove Garza to the address of Claire Hewson on October 11th.
He told us Garza sent him to dump about a dozen guns into the Hudson.
We have divers at the site now.
Not to mention the other guards he named, apparently on the payroll.
Nice job, Al.
Everyone.
Really good work.
You got a sec, detective?
Sure.
I checked around.
Your friend Al called in a few favours to bring you here.
So, what's the verdict?
Am I worth it?
I look forward to working with you, detective.
- Hey.
- What did he want?
- I'm not sure.
- If you're not sure, that's not good.
Big city politics, right?
Who knows, maybe I'll get used to it.
You did.
So, what'd you decide about the apartment?
What, 76th and Madison?
Got the park right there, the Whitney.
No, neighbourhood's not really my style.
- Really?
- Looking for something closer to work.
More practical.
What was I thinking?
- Hey.
- Hey.
So you...
- ...figure it out?
- What, this love stuff?
- Yeah.
- Me?
Yeah, I'm out of this game.
Wow, that guy must've been a real winner, huh?
Oh, man, wait, did Roe say something to you?
Because I know you can't remember my life.
Now, if you think about it, and it's true and he really loved her it's almost too sad.
Then don't think about it.
Night.
- You sure you can't stay?
- No, I gotta work early.
So, what do you do?
Are we really asking that now?
- You free on Friday?
- No.
- Saturday?
- Nope.
You sure there's nobody else?
Just me.
Bye.
Tom.
Yeah.
Right.
You remember.

Desperately searching, are you?
You find it, but don't like it?
You do like it, but you aren't satisfied?
You want more?
You keep searching.
You keep searching in vain?
The circle gets closed.
Whatever the end result may be, your experience remains forever.
Your experience is the story.
It is the story that matters.
It'll always find you.
You are your path.
You are the story.
Ever felt there's something more up there to make you dream on?
But it governs your fate as well?
Triglav is a kingdom and the highest peak in Slovenia.
Its 3-headed silhouette makes it unique for people at its foot.
For a long time their fear stopped them to approach it.
They thought it is the home of the deities.
Still, the giant kept arousing local people's imagination.
Four local men reached its top intrepidlyfor the first time.
No man set his foot up there before them.
A bold venture.
Soon many more tried.
Vodnik, the first Slovene poet tried too, but alas, he failed.
Rocks and stones soar up above us, barren is the wall and peak.
ancient master cliffs erected, come, ye builder, learn from him.
Slovenian national awareness was raised by the priest Aljaž.
He bought Triglav's top to erect a shelter.
Asymbolic gesture of a great man and a patriot!
Triglav's sunny side is gentle, kind and friendly, unlike its northern and seemingly unconquerable gigantic face.
Its northern wall forms a tight closure of the Vrata valley.
Not for the vertiginous!
After 100 years, first attempts from the north were made too.
Very slowly the reputation of mighty northern precipices spread around.
Climbers made them famous.
TheTriglav North face!
Only two attempts were made before the Great War, and were followed by fierce
Slovene-German rivalry between 1918 and 1941.
Pillars
The centralTriglav pillar was the focus of attention for climbers of 1930s and 1940s.
New routes were a challenge and became a matter of prestige.
Joža Eop, weak and untrained, made an attempt just a month after WWII was finally over.
He made sure that after the fall of Nazism theTriglav North Face belongs to the Slovenes at last.
By 1960's most of the routes had been ascended.
New routes kept emerging, and soon totalled almost 30.
The spirit was brave enough but they were soon downhearted by the extreme difficulty of the smooth monolith upper crux which seemed utopian, unclimbable and awe-inspiring.
Awe-inspiring.
They call me the Sphinx.
Triglav is my home.
This is my story.
The Sphinx
These two are free of charge.
-Great.
Let me through.
There's a narrow crack when you enter the great roof.
Hold it with your left hand, put your right hand above it, grip a tiny crack, and your foot can easily slip there.
You poor thing.-I'm still sore.
Stop teasing me.
What's that route called again?
-The Sphinx!
You must be Miha then!
His climbing partner?
Yes.Would you like a cocktail?
The Sphinx cocktail.Wicked!
-No.
I'll try it.
I'm parched!
-Go for it!
Do you know the Sphinx's riddle?
"'Which creature goes on 4 legs in the morning, at mid-day on 2, and in the evening on 3?"'
Who cares!
Have a drink instead!
-No, I have to train tomorrow.
Just one.
-No.Beware of the Sphinx.
Don't leave yet!
Hold this for me, mate, I'm off to the loo.-Hurry up.
Not the same width all of them!
Every crack will be different.
Don't be a smart Alec.
The oak, the birch, the larch.
Have you got a spanking rod too?
-I'd need one for you!
Save yourselves for the Sphinx!
It's no joke up there.
According to Kunaver, to solve the riddle is logical and easy.
Presumably, once upon a time I did offer a logical solution.
I never offer anything.
The way is open, if you get it.
What are you doing on all fours?
Where's everyone?
This is me and her, and you.
-Where are the rest of them?
We're all here, the three of us!
4-2-3.
It's 3 a.m.!
It's 3 a.m., let's make a move!
Where to?
The store opens at 7, we'll go shopping then.
No rush.
What's the matter with you?
-The Sphinx cocktail again?
Are you okay?
- I'm perfectly fine.
8, 9, 10
Plus 2 makes it 12.
This should definitely do.
-I've never seen so many of them.
Quiet!
You know what time it is?
Iworked night shift.
To climb my face remains the greatest challenge.
Following 10 years of attempts, Ante Mahkota wants to try again, this time with Peter Šeetinin.
The holes, and I've bought a new nylon rope.
Turn it down!
Stop making noise!
Cats are on heat.-Night shift again.-It's almost dawn anyway.
Will these be okay?
-Sure.This is the one.
8 a.m., I must be off to work.
Keep you mouth shut, you don't want to end up locked up.
I'm the boss there.
I've made these ones as well.
By yourself?
-No!
With a blacksmith!
1966
- During the traditional climbing era there's only rule:
All technical devices are allowed to be employed in ascending.
1995
- In free climbing cracks only are employed to ascend.
The only rule is to employ gear for protection only.
I'll take the yellow one!
We need the green one too.
-Definitely.We'll take it.
What about wider cracks?
-Nice colour.
I'll take it.
Listen, boys, this might be something for us.
'TheTriglav North Face hides two mythical mysteries.
The Goldhorn and the Sphinx.'
Perfect timing.
It follows us everywhere.
Once upon a time a white chamois with golden horns found himself directly facing a poacher.
The buck symbolises the immortal nature ...
-While the poacher is a mortal ignoring all warnings.
My Face hasn't been climbed free-style yet.
Miha Kajzelj and Gregor Kresal aim to set new boundaries.
The Sphinx's Face is their dream.
We'll take all.-Will you climb the moon?
Where are you off to?
A legendary route, free style.
-The Sphinx's Face, free style.
The Face?
Did you catch that?
-You don't want to be too heavy.
We've already been there.
Is this too much gear?
Who knows.You'll be the first.
I guess you're clever enough.
Not so good to be too clever, sometimes.-Is that so?
You know what they used to climb with in the old days?
Crazy, man!
This is so light.
-I'll show you something.
Look at this, it's for sale too.
State-of-the-art technology...
This one with a metal ring...
and an even older specimen.
This is what you used?
-But we're still hanging on!
It worked?
-You're kidding me.
We'll take these.
-Okay.
This belongs to the museum.
Hi, you're doing well, guys.
We're well trained.
Are you off to somewhere big?
-TheTriglav north face.
Vow.-We used to romp up there like young bucks.
Good luck!
This is cheating!
Stop messing with the flour.
Train without it.
You need to climb higher to get at a bit of a fright as well.
Look over there.
This is what I call training.
I've been climbing for 3 years.
I have never had a fall.
Good girl.-Bye.
-Bye.
They thought the great roof was unclimbable.
How's your hand?
Can we try again?
-I took the bandage off today.
Should be okay.
We can try again for the second or third time.
Ante kept trying for ten years!
Show me that photo again.
-Where is it now?
You're not wearing these boots?
I am.
I wore them the first time.
I'll fix them with some glue.
Here.-Silly me.Enough training for today, let's go for a beer.
It was on purpose that I shaped the perfect vertical at the top.
The rock is smooth, the cracks few and far between, and the overhangs are massive.
I am unsolvable, so they say.
It's all in your head, mind you.
I managed to make a recording of that song.-Summer night?
... walls made all of trees, ceiling is the sky...
We used to ride bicycles here.
-Or took a train to go climbing.
The old road used to be up there.
Iwas always sick.-You, sissy.
How many times have you tried it?
-I've stopped counting.
I hope I'll be okay up there.
-You better are.
I'm going to try a new move at the 12th piton.
Right.
I never jammed my hand in that crack.
Bloody traffic jam!
-We'll be stuck here, or what?
I hope the weather holds for us.
-It should.
Fingers crossed.
You can't beat the time.
All in its good time.
What?
What engine was that?
It can only be president Tito's.
The speed of it!
Going hunting bucks, perhaps?
-As long as they don't aim at us.
The gate didn't used to be here, one could drive to the hut.
We've got plenty of time, today we're the first ones here.
Have you unpacked yet?
Look, the hut.
Beep the horn to let them know we're coming.
The weather should be okay.
-The forecast's good.
You're so clumsy.
-I always make a mess.
A typical local dish, mackerel.
-Be my guest.
Did you know that Ante was the founding editor of this magazine?
Ante who?
-The Ante!
Ante Mahkota ofthe Sphinx?
-Yes, him.
Wasn't he the general manager?
And a founder of a magazine?
A brilliant guy.
Sports lottery, 100 women's hike toTriglav were his ideas.And he was married to Marjana Deržaj.
Summer night, our humble home, the walls made of trees...
What was that?
Sorry about the wait, boys.
This is delicious though.
Half a sausage will hardly do.
Not my fault.
Small portions, hard times.
Why do you keep sneaking behind our backs?
Sit down.
And bring us two Red bulls!
-I can't.Aguy from Croatia bought them all this morning.
Every single can.
Sausages in cans?
What cans?
Now, get into position.
- Have you got everything?
I don't want to cover the entire north face.
Hey, you, come over.
Okay, lonely boy.
Guys, what are you up to?
-Join them, I'll take the photo.
Take one of me and her only.
-Come here,Tone,join us.
Look at her contortions?
Have they started sagging yet?
Did you see the lightening?
-Begorra, I hope it doesn't rain.
Remember the storm in 1961.
There's no exit from the Sphinx in bad weather.
Where are you going?
-The Sphinx.
-The Face.The great roof.
The weather should be okay.
It's a difficult route.
We'll set out at 5.-Too late.
You have to leave before 4 a.m.
Drop by on your way back.
-We will.
Our car's down there.
Move, Šeetinc, let's go!
The Sphinx
-The 1st Free Ascent
Wait!
The Sphinx-The Journey.
1 free ticket still available!
The best of them tried it all to get a close look of my Face.
To touch it and solve the riddle.
Who knows what my riddle is?
This is top gear we've got now!
-Only the very best!
We'll use the lightest rope.
What's this?
Who split flour?
Damn it, I've lost my chalk.
Listen what Ante wrote:
'"I touched the mighty Guillotine for the very first time.
It rocked precariously.
We were terrified it would break and fall down."
These guys surely had guts.
-So will you, tomorrow.
4-2-3.
Beware of'the butcher'.
A piece of meat in the rock?
This is the best hold!
What a silly dream!
-What about?
Don't ask.4-2-3, and a pound offlesh at the 12th piton.
Was it the riddle?
4-2-3 legs?
-What riddle?
The Sphinx's?
What about the meat?
-Are you hungry?
-You're such a clown.
You want to fight bare handed?
Go for it.
Let the game begin!
Watch out, a rock!
-Is someone yelling up there?
Some kids may be stuck up there.
Noone's mad enough to climb it.
The ledges.
Here we are.So many attempts, so many failures over the years.
This will be our lucky day.
-But we have to be careful.
Why are you so pale?
It's your 10th time.
I'm new here.
One of my pitons is still here.
-Hammer another one.
This will do.
-It holds well.
Shall we draw lots?
-Why bother, I'll lead.
I'll belay.Give me the rope.
Hold it.
-I got you.
Technical climbing:climbers use technical devices to ascend.
Free climbing: climbers use equipment for protection only.
This is quite scary, isn't it?
-I've been scared since dawn.
Remember our last time here?
-Today we'll be more careful.
At least the weather's improved.
-We're lucky enough.
Which do you want?
-This one.
-Not the Guillotine again!
I'll follow you in no time.
I'm ready.
Okay, I'll belay.
The ledges.The Guillotine.
Shit, bloody Guillotine seems to be wedging apart.
If you keep hammering, half of the wall will collapse.
The same as in 1956 and in 1964, the fissure is getting bigger.
How is it?
I managed to hammer it.
I hope it doesn't fall out.
It won't.
It's held for 30 years and will hold today for sure.
Who said anything about falling?
It's perfectly okay.
Stop tugging at it.You don't want it to collapse.
My Face became a myth before its first ascent.
No wonder, since I resisted all attempts.
The Guillotine was the crux.
It terrified you, didn't it?
For 10 years your predecessors trembled with fear underneath it.
But this was just the beginning.
You're just about to face the riddle's crux itself.
My Great Roof is unclimbable!
The ledges.The Guillotine.
The Great Roof.
Ante, loosen it.
It's a good job you hammered lots of pitons last time.
Begorra, what a precipice.
What about this loose flake?
I'll let it drop,just in case.
Your first piton in the roof.
Here it is.As strong as ever.
30 years old.
As if it was made of concrete.
But we still can't conquer it.
Damn big roof.
I'm too heavy.I have to leave some stuff here, ropes, friends.
But I've got the winning combo!
The Sphinx's combination.4-2-3 and up above the edge!
-Beats me.
There are no combinations here.
I've made sure of that.
You hammered a lot of gear here.
Give me the rope.
What an overhang!
Stand to the right.Just one bit.
A bit higher.
More to the right.
Where to?
On my head?
I've got the aiders, begorra.
Well done!
One rung higher!
Keep trying.
I'm hammering.
If I fall here, I'll pull out all the pitons.
What did you say?
-4-2-3.
Not talking to you.
Stop messing.
And you end up in a mess, just like I told you.
I've had the winning combo!
What is the butcher doing there?
To hell.
-You had a good hold up there.
There's a butcher in the crack.
-Hammer it out.
That's exactly what I'll do now.
-Do it, mate.
That's it.
I'll remove it.
It's the best hold.
Look at ti.
The butcher!
Shit.
Gosh, are there people camping at the top again?
Let me come down, I got it sorted.
This was our pain in the arse.
The Sphinx can seriously mess up your life.-We should be okay now.
Hang on.4-2-3, and the butcher.
Was this your dream?
-Maybe.
Now we've got to climb it.
-Bloody hell.
The Guillotine.The Great Roof.
Well done, Šeetinc!
Get a grip.
You're nearly there!
We've done it.
-We've done it.
That's it, Ante.
We've done it.
That's it, Ante.
We've done it.
Well done, Šeetinc!
-Well done, mate!
Bloody hell!
Belay off.
-Give me the rope.
What?
Loosen it!
-The rope!
-I don't get it.-What did you say?
Loosen it!
-The rope!
-I don't get it.-What did you say?
I'll let you get away with it.
How did you manage to climb it?
Didn't you hammer my piton?
I've got you.-Well done.
You did a great job here, mate.
-What else was I supposed to do?
That's it, mate.
-The crux is behind us.
You set many a myth in my realm.
You chased the Goldhorn away.
The myth of my formidable Face has just faded away too.
The myth of my formidable Face has just faded away too.
I call this a game and might turn it into my own advantage.
Go,Ante go!
You've hauled me up like a sack.
-You're heavy enough, begorra.
You've hauled me up like a sack.
-You're heavy enough, begorra.
What a view!
-Indeed.
We're the first party here.
We're the first party here.
You're damn right.
Don't we deserve a snack now?
-You bet.
Serve the sausages.
Don't we deserve a snack now?
-You bet.
Serve the sausages.
And then we'll continue.
-Today?
-Of course.
Such a nice ledge.
Why don't we bivvy?
Such a nice ledge.
Why don't we bivvy?
No way, we can easily reach the top before nightfall.
Are you sure?
-We can at least give it a try.
Are you sure?
-We can at least give it a try.
Up we go, chop chop chop, full speed ahead along the ridge.
Up we go, chop chop chop, full speed ahead along the ridge.
It's grade 7, maximum.
It seems easy enough.
The Roof was definitely the crux.
We're out of trouble now.
The Roof was definitely the crux.
We're out of trouble now.
Will I get the toothpaste next?
We'll manage the top portion.
You're right.
It's been going on for too long.
Let's end it.
You're right.
It's been going on for too long.
Let's end it.
Did it just switch itself on?
Did it just switch itself on?
It's not even switched on.
What the hell...?
-What are you two doing here?
What the hell...?
-What are you two doing here?
You old-timers?
Did you descend from the top?
I knew there was something dodgy going on.-Some weird joke.
It was you with the waitress?
-She held us like this.
I wondered what she was up to.
-And you walked over my chalk!
Where did you get this, boyo?
-Want to borrow my comb as well?
Forget the comb, here's the toothbrush.
Forget the comb, here's the toothbrush.
The ledges.The Guillotine.
The Great Roof.The Nest.TheTop.
The ledges.The Guillotine.
The Great Roof.The Nest.TheTop.
Both ascents left a deep mark in my Face
Both ascents left a deep mark in my Face and respectively ended an era.
They differed, although they were very much alike too.
They differed, although they were very much alike too.
Total dedication in their quest.
I'm calm now.
Total dedication in their quest.
I'm calm now.
Ante struggled for 10 years before he found his perfect partner in Peter.
I became the fulfillment of his dreams.
Miha and Gregor got third time lucky in their attempts to smear my Face with flour.
to smear my Face with flour.
It was a heavy burden for them that noone had done it yet.
There's no challenge if you know the answer.
Without a challenge, there is no strong will.
No progress without strong will!
No progress without strong will!
You know what this is,Ante?
-The butcher piton.
I still have a few at home.
-I forged it myself.-Did you?
I still have a few at home.
-I forged it myself.-Did you?
At the blacksmith's.
I made the pointed ones to jam even deeper.
Where did you hammer it?
-In the Great Roof.
You know why it's here now?
-Because it fell out.
No, it held tight, but we took it out to get a better grip.
No, it held tight, but we took it out to get a better grip.
Really?
-Keep it as a souvenir.
You hammered another one?
-Yes,we did, a bit higher up.
You hammered another one?
-Yes,we did, a bit higher up.
It was so damn heavy, our gear.
20 iron carabiners on top of it.
Plus the ropes.You name it.
-I can't imagine we'd it now.
Plus the ropes.You name it.
-I can't imagine we'd it now.
When we threw stones it took them 6 seconds to hit the ground.
600 metres of overhang.
Most amazing, we climbed so fast we had 4 litres of water left.
For the first time in my life,
I leaned over and was pouring it down.
Just like that?
-Why bother carrying it back with you.
What a romantic clinking sound it made.
Like crystal breaking.
My book ends with this.
Look at these two!
-Wait, I want another gulp.-Too late.
We've got another flask.
-What flask?
We used to climb with alders made of wood and hemp rope.
I took us the whole day.
I never imagined you could do it free.
Me neither.
Šeetinin climbed the final pitch like a true grand master.
What advanced gear you have now.
-But the Sphinx remains difficult.
Hardly any easier now as it used to be.
The Sphinx was a symbol.
I was in awe when I first saw it.
I started drawing routes.
As Eop said:
The guy who climbs it will need a lot of balls.
It remains a cult route.
No matter how you climb it.
Peter, let's hold each other.
Friends!
I hope we enjoy these views for another good while.
The Sphinx threw herself from her high rock after Oedipus solved its famous riddle.
-Hi, guys!
-Hi.
Where is the Sphinx?
-This is the Sphinx.
Right here.
What the hell are you wearing?
You're with the devil!
Are you tired?
Want a bite?
-No, I'm rushing down to dinner.
Got to finish a text on Oedipus.
Where's the Face's edge?
Right there where you are!
Right here?
Great.Will you help me count down?
Yes, of course.
-I'm ready.
4-2-3!
- Hey!
Once more please!
-4-3-2-1!
See you.
Begorra, these modern times!
I preferred the old days though.
Iwouldn't swap it either.
-Me neither.
Neither would I.
The story will always find you.
You are your path.

The doctors there aren't expensive, are they?
I'm already working doubles at a bar
To put myself through grad school.
Don't worry.
Our patients are our first priority.
So you're one of the doctors?
Yes.
I'm dr.
Montgomery.
Oh, you're the one I'm coming to see.
I'm patty...
Oh!
Patty, what is it?
Oh, my stomach.
Oh.
Okay, okay.
It's okay.
It's okay, patty.
What did you give me?
I
- I feel better.
It's an antiemetic.
It helps with the nausea.
mm.
It's tender?
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna do an ultrasound.
Have you had any other symptoms lately,
Any recent changes in health?
Patty, what is it?
I had an abortion two months ago.
I
- I tried to go to this clinic,
But outside were all these...
Protestors?
The things they were yelling--
Calling me a murderer, a- a baby killer.
I couldn't go in.
I tried to find a private doctor,
But most of them won't do abortions.
I'm lucky my girlfriend knew a doctor who would.
Yeah.
Well, it's hard to do your job
When you're getting death threats.
Some doctors aren't even trained in the procedure anymore.
I want kids.
I do.
Just not now.
I mean, babies are expensive.
Kids need time and attention.
It seemed wrong to bring one into the world
I couldn't do right by.
Patty, you don't have to justify your decision to me.
The doctor told me
I might have some cramping and tenderness,
But I didn't expect to feel this bad.
Okay, let's take a look.
What is it?
Is something wrong?
Patty, I'm sorry.
Uh...
You're still pregnant.
The fetus looks to be about 19 weeks.
But this-
- I-I can't.
I
- I can't be pregnant.
Charlie and I, we used a condom.
I had an abortion.
Sometimes when an abortion is done early,
The pregnancy is so small that the doctor can miss
The embryonic tissue when removing it from the uterus.
But I got drunk last weekend.
I
- I smoked two packs of cigarettes.
You have to do something.
You can just do it again, right?
Patty, you n need to understand that this isn't just tissue.
You're carrying a fetus now,
And the procedure is much more difficult.
What would you have to do to me?
There's something called laminaria--
Seaweed sticks that absorb fluid and swell.
They would be inserted into your cervix to help it dilate.
24 hours later, you would be brought back in,
Put under general anesthesia,
And the fetus would be removed
Using forceps and suction.
Could the baby survive?
No, not at 19 weeks.
A baby needs to be at least 24 weeks
To survive outside the uterus.
The fetus would die during the procedure.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Look, uh, there are other options.
You can carry the baby to term-- don't you think I considered all the options last time?
I can't carry a child.
I am on my feet eight hours a day.
I have no money.
God, I'm pregnant.
Look, I, uh...
I know that this is a shock,
So why don't you take some time,
Think about what you want to do?
Okay, say hello to a...
Married man.
hey. hey.
If two people get married,
And you don't actually witness it,
Did it really happen?
Sorry about that. mm-hmm.
Well, congratulations.
Thank you.
Hey, any, uh, any word from the medical board?
Well, I still have my license,
So I have every right to be here.
Wait.
That's-- that's not what I meant.
I...
Sometimes I hate being a doctor.
My new patient-- she's 19 weeks pregnant
And she may want an abortion.
A partial-birth abortion?
Partial-birth is not a medical term.
It's political, and you know it.
Okay, late-term abortion, second-trimester, de--
Who cares what you call it?
You can't do it. yes, she can.
It's at the doctor's discretion, and it is legal.
Did you even counsel her on her options?
She was counseled before her first abortion. her first abortion?
Is she using the procedure as birth control?
No, she used condoms, and why are you judging?
I-- there is no judgment from us.
We are doctors, and we all know birth control sometimes fails,
And I didn't want to tell her this because I knew it would
Freak her out, but the doctor she went to the first time
Was a quack who didn't know what the hell he was doing,
And now she's come to me, and my job is to help her.
And how'd you leave it with her?
She's gonna think about it and then make her choice.
Well, maybe the choice has already been made.
What the hell does that mean?
Well, I mean, condoms are usually effective,
And the stats on failed abortions are negligible,
So maybe this baby was meant to live.
You want to force a woman to give birth and raise a child
That she clearly doesn't want?
Well, after what she did,
Patty should probably give the baby up for adoption.
What she did was exercise her legal right to choose.
Hey.
Hey, pete.
So if she comes back, what are you gonna do?
I have no idea.
Oh, my god.
It's betsey.
She's in the e.R.
My head hurts.
I know, baby.
That was a big fall.
I was in the kitchen cooking, and I just--
I should've been watching her.
You have to fix her.
I will, marshall.
I promise.
I don't like it here.
Oh, baby, no one likes hospitals,
But the doctors are gonna make you better.
No.
My mommy and daddy died here.
Everybody dies here.
is she all right?
Her vitals are stable.
Any loss of consciousness or focal neuro signs?
Exam was negative.
C- spine?
Clear.
We're waiting on c.T. And portable chest.
I thought social services
Placed her with a family in riverside.
Yeah.
What is she-- what is she doing here in st.
Ambrose?
Her family moved to the westside a few months ago.
She's been right here?
C.T. Shows an extensive contusion
In the left temporal region.
- D - does that mean surgery?
The swelling could go down on its own.
We'll need to monitor her closely for the next few days.
any other injuries or signs of trauma?
No.
X-ray looks good.
No broken bones.
Just a healed clavicle fracture.
Looks a couple months old.
Wait, betsey broke her collarbone two months ago,
And now she falls down the stairs?
Now we shouldn't jump to any conclusions.
Okay, I do this every day, sheldon,
And to me, that sounds like abuse.
cooper, you cannot jump to abuse.
We should have social services make an assessment.
No.
well, then what do you think we should do?
We can't leave her with those people.
If you guys had just taken her when she got left in the office.
What, then this wouldn't have happened?
Oh, come on.
It's not like you took her.
guys, this isn't helping.
Okay, pete, you met the parents.
What did you think?
They were loving and concerned,
And betsey is clearly very attached.
Well, to betsey, any parents are good, even bad ones. if they're abusing her--
We have to get her out of that house.
I broke 4 bones by the time I was 10.
Kids fall all the time. okay, look,
It seems like betsey has found a really good family.
We cannot risk ruining that unless we have concrete proof.
Well, let's get some.
Cooper!
Hi, I'm dr.
Cooper freedman. hi.
Hi.
And this is dr.
Violet turner.
We, uh, used to work with betsey's dad.
Oh.
Naomi!
Hey, sweetie.
Phil and gina rakoff.
Behind the video game,
That's our son marshall.
Hi.
I'm dr.
Naomi bennett.
Betsey, look how popular you are-- all these visitors.
Uh, why don't we step over here
So I can update you on what's going on?
I'm so glad to see you.
Why didn't you visit me?
I
- I wanted to.
I did.
But--
I don't want to talk to you.
it's okay.
hi, sweetie.
so how do you like your new family?
That fall must have been scary, huh?
You did fall, right, sweetie?
Sweetie, did somebody hurt you?
No.
How about-- how about when you-- when you broke the bone?
I...
I fell off the jungle gym.
Betsey, listen, even if somebody told you not to,
You can tell me, okay?
I love you.
We all love you here.
But you sent me away.
what's the matter, honey?
what's going on?
Why is she upset?
Um, to be perfectly honest, I'm concerned about this fall
That seems to have come right on the heels of the other accident
Where she broke the clavicle.
Kids fall.
Yes, they do, but two severe ones so close together, it's...
Are you accusing us of hurting her?
We love betsey.
You have no right.
Don't be mean to my mommy.
You're upsetting our children,
And you're both way outta line.
Get the hell out and don't come back.
Poor kid, huh?
Yeah, I suppose, uh, we made our bed.
What, you think this is our fault?
I think that we-- all of us at the practice--
We make decisions and we don't think about the consequences.
All I can think about lately are consequences.
This patty thing's really killing you.
I'm fine.
You're not fine.
You want to have a baby.
You want a baby so bad that we broke up, and now--
In a few weeks, that fetus could be a baby.
Not just a collection of cells, but a baby,
And, uh...
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
I should go.
Mm-hmm.
When I offered to take you to lunch,
The hospital cafeteria wasn't exactly what I had in mind.
Yes, well, I need to be here right now.
And I only have a half an hour.
I gotta pick up olivia.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm happy to see you as much as possible.
Don't.
Do not ask me about d.C. Again, okay?
Not now.
Betsey's in I.C.U.,
Addison may be performing an abortion
On a woman who is 19 weeks pregnant.
Hmm.
Late-term by definition, but certainly not illegal.
I mean, I can see how that might frustrate someone
Whose work is creating life.
That's a careful response.
You don't agree with me.
A fetus may be a life,
But it's not a biologically independent life,
So in my mind and in the mind of the supreme court,
The right of termination belongs to the mother.
Well, thank you for the civics lesson.
Maybe you should offer to assist addison.
If I felt that strongly about it, I would.
You know me.
I'm all about
Going after what you believe in as hard as possible.
She hates me.
Betsey does not hate you.
Of course she hates me.
I'm the one who sent her away.
I'm the one who looked that little girl in the eye
And sold her a-a fairy tale
About how marvelous her new life was gonna be
Because I couldn't tell her the truth.
And now her foster parents could be hurting her.
For all we know, she did fall.
But we don't know, do we?
It's just too much.
First, betsey loses her parents,
And then her aunt drops her off here like a package
That was tossed into the trash by us,
The people who were supposed to care,
And now tack on abuse--
I...
I had an obligation to take care of dell's little girl.
Look, you've gotta stop beating yourself up.
Or is it me that you blame for all this?
well, right now I'm the one being blamed,
By betsey,
And that's all I can think about.
Can I go home soon?
We're working on it, honey.
I told you to stay away from my family.
I'm not coming in.
She is.
Gladys?
Hi, betsey.
Remember me?
Our little girl has a brain injury,
And you called social services?
outside, right now.
What are you doing?
She needs to stay calm.
For the next few days, our main focus has to be her health.
I am worried about her health.
Dr. Freedman,
I will follow up.
I promise.
But I think you're wrong about phil and gina.
it is oddly therapeutic.
Oh, please.
You are preaching to the choir.
My goodness.
I can't get enough.
Oh, but maya's gonna be back soon enough,
So I have to enjoy it while I can.
Huh, sweetie?
Okay, I'll see you. bye.
say bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Is dr.
Montgomery in?
Uh, she's at the hospital.
She should be back soon.
Uh, can you tell her that patty stopped by?
Uh, patty?
Hi.
I'm, uh, I'm dr.
Naomi bennett.
Would-- would you like to wait in my office?
I have some tissues.
Okay.
I had a plan.
I was gonna finish grad school,
Get my m.B.A.,
Meet a great guy who thinks I hung the moon,
Get married, and around 35, we'd have a baby.
Yeah, well, no one is ready-- ever ready-- to have a baby.
It's just-- you just do it.
You know, my-- my daughter was 16 years old
When she got pregnant with olivia here.
She hadn't even finished high school,
And I almost...
No, I...
I tried to force her to have an abortion.
And I'm so grateful every single day
That she didn't.
But she had you to help her.
My boyfriend charlie-- he-- he couldn't get away fast enough
When I told him I was pregnant.
Well, that just means he's not ready to be a father.
I can't be a mother.
I have nothing.
I have to work all the time.
B- but being a mother isn't about what you have.
It's about who you are.
I can't have this baby.
I can't.
I already got an abortion before.
I can live through it again.
It's not the same, patty.
At 19 weeks, do you know that your child can hear you?
It can be startled by loud noises.
Your child already has vocal cords
And fingerprints and air sacs in her lungs.
She can move her arms and legs,
Not unlike olivia here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know you're confused, which is why I think
You need a little more time to think about it.
And I promise you that I can offer you
All the support you need to get through this pregnancy.
Just please-- just consider...
Just consider...
Carrying the baby to term.
What did you say to patty?
She comes here to see me, and then you scare her
Into changing her mind?
I didn't scare her.
I talked to her.
You had no right.
She needed to think about what she was doing.
This abortion could affect her for the rest of her life.
Any choice she makes
Would affect her for the rest of her life. all the more reason
For patty to be sure of her decision now.
Okay, you don't get to have an opinion.
You don't even work here.
Which makes the only objective person in the room.
The patient was made aware of her options, and she chose,
End of story.
This isn't some clinical trial where we line up
The pros and cons.
There's an emotional component here
That can't be quantified.
It's not just emotional.
This is physical.
When you crush that baby's skull to get it through the cervix,
It feels that pain.
You don't think I know that?
!
I don't think you care.
Of course I care, but patty is my patient.
You violated the trust
That I established with my patient-- my patient.
You have crossed so far over the line, you can't even see it.
You know what?
I did what I thought was right.
Whether or not to do this procedure is not your decision.
It is mine.
I thought it was patty's.
You didn't want to do it anyway,
And now you don't have to.
Okay, don't pretend that you did this for me.
You manipulated a terrified and confused girl.
Preach whatever you want to your own patients,
But stay away from mine!
How's betsey doing?
Her intracranial pressure is holding steady,
So no surgery yet.
Honestly, for once, I don't want to cut.
I get that.
It's a tricky procedure.
Besides, betsey's just a kid.
And her father died on my table.
What happened with dell was not your fault.
You don't really blame yourself, do you?
I don't know.
I just...
I've got a little girl in the I.C.U.,
And all I can think about...
All I can focus on is how badly I want a drink.
My mama always says,
"god doesn't give with both hands."
You're young, beautiful, brilliant.
Has to be something you can't have.
Some days, I'd give all that up.
That's just the craving talking.
But the longer you go without a drink--
I drank at your wedding.
I thought it was ginger ale.
I spit it out.
Okay.
Since then?
Nothing.
But I can't stop thinking about it.
It was an accident.
Don't turn a slip into a fall.
Get your butt to a meeting.
I will.
I gotta go watch betsey a little longer.
Hey.
You okay?
No.
You know, betsey's just a kid.
She suffered a trauma.
So give her some time.
Time won't change the fact that pete didn't let me keep her.
What?
Look, I'm all for blaming pete when it's justified,
But this is not his fault.
If you wanted to adopt betsey, you could've fought harder.
Well, cooper,
You've been married for what, like a minute and a half?
So what do you know?
Okay, do you want a shoulder or do you want the truth?
Spit it out.
Okay.
After betsey left, you didn't visit her.
None of us did.
Yeah, but you judged us all for not coming to her rescue.
You played the guilt card, the responsibility card.
You made her your mission,
And then the social worker takes her away,
And...
You know, out of sight, out of mind.
Oh, god.
I'm vile.
I am selfish.
I am selfish and vile.
Come on.
Violet, we all failed betsey.
We just have to figure out how to help her now.
you have to know that we didn't...
We could never-- where do they get off accusing us of hurting her?
Look, we all just want what's best for her.
I should probably take marshall home.
You're leaving?
I'm staying with you, honey, okay?
Hug your sister.
I need some help in here!
what?
What's happening?
10 milligrams of lorazepam.
She was fine.
I don't understand.
what's going on?
Her I.C.P. Is off the chart.
We need to get her into surgery now.
Come on.
I'm going with her.
I should go, too, but marshall--
You both go.
I'll stay with him.
Thank you.
Will betsey be okay?
Dr. Shepherd is the best.
She'll do everything she can.
You have to make her okay.
You have to.
You promised!
Make her okay!
Make betsey better!
Make her better!
You promised!
Marshall, it's okay.
You said you will!
Make her better!
Hey, pete.
Hey.
Who's your friend?
This is marshall, betsey's foster brother.
Mommy says we don't say "foster." of course.
I'm sheldon.
Hey, can I join you?
Sure.
Now you and betsey are about the same age.
Must be nice to have her living with you, huh?
Yeah.
It's fun.
Uh, hey, listen, I gotta check on a patient.
Uh, do you mind?
I'll be back in a couple of minutes.
Now I'm sure you got upset by what happened to betsey,
But the doctors here are very good.
They're gonna take great care of her.
Does your dad ever get upset?
Sometimes.
But does he get more upset now that betsey lives with you?
He fights with mommy a lot more.
And mommy gets sad.
I don't like it.
Of course not.
You love your mom.
So what do you do to make her happy?
I'm an extra-good boy so she knows I love her.
I tell betsey to be extra good, too,
To listen to daddy and mommy.
When-- when betsey doesn't listen,
Does your dad do more than just talk to her?
Does he...
Spank her or...
No.
What about your mom?
Is she ever mean to betsey?
No.
But sometimes I help her to listen.
How do you do that?
Is that what you did on the jungle gym?
Betsey's clumsy.
It was her fault.
And when betsey misbehaves,
I guess that's her fault, too.
Must make it harder for your parents.
Yeah.
And that's not right.
So I guess it makes sense, then,
That she needs to be punished.
I'm done with my ice cream.
Can I have more?
How's it going?
It's tricky.
The hematoma's on the tip of the left temporal lobe.
If I remove more than 4 centimeters,
She'll have persistent speech problems.
You checking up on me?
Worried I'm not competent to do this?
Actually, I have complete faith in you.
I'm just worried you lost faith in yourself.
Sooner or later, this kid's gotta catch a break.
Dell did everything for betsey, and it still all went bad.
Now why do you think having kids scares the crap outta me?
Cooper must want 'em.
Of course.
He's giving me the time to get on board.
That's nice.
Addison had to choose between having a kid and being with sam.
Now she's got neither.
You're lucky...
To have a man like coop.
I got it.
what's wrong?
Damn it.
There's a bleed.
I need to remove more of the temporal lobe to stop it.
If I am off by 1 centimeter-- amelia, this is what you do.
Don't think.
Just do it.
I knew betsey was holding back.
Yeah, but marshall didn't admit to pushing her.
He didn't have to--
The way he talked about betsey, his aggressiveness with pete.
It's clear marshall's been hurting betsey.
Can't believe it.
The kid's only 8 years old.
Well, did-- did marshall feel any guilt at all?
He justifies his actions
Under the guise of protecting his mother.
There's a pride he associates with being a good boy.
So the kid's a psychopath.
That's great.
No, no one's saying that.
Look, there's a reason why we don't diagnose these kids
With antisocial personality disorder.
The prefrontal cortex
Doesn't really develop till we're in our 20s.
Sheldon, I know that.
But while the brain is maturing, he could be learning new ways
To hurt people. would therapy help?
Possibly.
Well, maybe-- maybe he just needs
More love and attention from his parents.
Why are we worrying about marshall?
Betsey's the one we care about.
Recent history notwithstanding.
Naomi.
We didn't give up on betsey, okay?
You weren't here.
It was difficult and complicated,
And you weren't here.
You need to keep marshall away from betsey.
What are you talking about?
Marshall loves his sister.
You're not involved in this.
Yes, I am.
I'm the one who promised betsey
She would be safe in foster care.
She is.
There's something wrong with marshall.
Who the hell are you?
Sheldon wallace.
I'm a psychiatrist at the practice.
Of course you are.
Betsey's intracranial pressure spiked when marshall
Was about to hug her.
She's clearly afraid of him.
You've never even talked to marshall.
Actually, I spent time with him earlier,
And I really do believe that he's trying to hurt her.
Wait.
What?
You interrogated our son?
He was trying to protect your daughter.
what kind of doctors are you?
We've heard enough.
Get out of here, or I'll call security.
How is she?
How's betsey?
She's out of surgery.
She's stable.
But she's in a coma.
I've been calling you all day.
I know.
I just needed some time.
I just wanted to apologize for dr.
Bennett.
She had no right to upset you like that.
Anyway, I-I...
I just wanted to make sure that you're okay
And tell you that I am here, to talk, to listen,
To help you in any way I can.
Dr. Montgomery?
I don't know what to do.
I can't tell you what to do.
I can only tell you that it's your choice.
Maybe it shouldn't be.
But it has to be.
Patty...
When it comes to abortion,
Everybody has an opinion.
Everybody's gonna want to tell you what to do.
If this were 1972, it would've been a back alley
And not my elevator that you would've collapsed in,
Because back then you didn't have a choice.
Now you do.
But it's still hard.
And even after you make the most difficult
And personal decision that there is,
It's still not safe,
Because you have some fanatic who claims to value life
Who can walk into an abortion clinic and blow it up.
Patty, you are the only one
Who knows if you're ready to have a child.
Everybody else's opinion is just background noise.
So if you want to keep this baby, I'll support you.
You want to give it up for adoption, I'll help.
You want an abortion, I'll do it.
I am not here to judge you.
I just need you to know that whatever decision you make
Is for you--
Not for me, not for dr.
Bennett,
For you.
Hey.
Any word on betsey?
she still hasn't woken up.
I
- I-I know I wasn't here
When betsey's aunt dropped her off,
And maybe I should've come back from africa--
No.
We-- we have olivia to take care of
And we're nowhere near done with maya, so--
Well, as much as she'd like to think otherwise.
I don't know.
Do you think that she'd be okay
If we didn't see her that often?
Well, she might not go to columbia.
No.
On the other hand, new york is just a short train ride
Away from d.C.
Hmm?
Fife asked me to go back with him.
And a-are you considering it?
I know.
You don't like him.
He is an arrogant ass.
I mean, I-I wouldn't pick him for you,
But what do I know?
How you doing since you and addison split?
Mm, I have my good days, bad days.
You think you two will manage to stay friends?
You think you will?
You're a good mother, gina.
You love marshall.
You spend time with him.
You take care of him.
You knew, didn't you?
He-- he... he doesn't have friends.
He fights with kids at school.
He says they pick on him,
But the other parents, the guidance counselors...
They always swear, marshall started it.
I knew he was different.
But you don't want to think...
I just-
- I
- I didn't want to see it.
I thought if we brought another kid into our home,
He'd have someone...
A friend.
That's not enough.
He needs--
More...
Love, attention... more of us.
Yeah.
I love you, betsey.
Wait.
Betsey can't go back in the system.
Marshall is my son.
He has to come first.
My kid would've been 6 this year.
A girl-
- I know it would've been a girl.
Ella.
She would've been in the first grade.
She would have the same gap between her teeth as me.
If you have this much regret about your own abortion,
Then how can you go through with this?
I know that that may have been
My one chance to get pregnant.
But still...
For me, it was...
The right decision at the time.
I do not take this lightly, nai.
To try to separate what I want personally
From what I need to do professionally is...
Killing me.
I want to strangle the doctor
Who botched this up in the first place.
we've come so far, right?
Then why can't patty get what she needs--
A safe and legal abortion without judgment?
Why does she have to go through this again?
Why do I have to go through this?
I hate what I'm about to do,
But...
I support patty's right to choose.
It is not enough to just have an opinion,
Because in a nation of over 300 million people,
There are only 1,700 abortion providers...
And I'm one of 'em.
Okay, patty.
We're ready.
Are you sure about this?
yeah, I'm sure.
This is what I want.
But I'm so scared.
I know.
I'm gonna take good care of you.
I just feel so alone.
You're not alone, patty.
You're not alone.
Prep tray and foley cath.
You did everything you could.
what if it's not enough?
What if the amount of temporal lobe
I removed from betsey damaged her brain?
She could lose her ability to speak
If she even wakes up.
It's been a rough couple of days.
The hospital can reach you if there are any changes.
Why don't we go to a meeting?
I'm grateful that we are friends
And that you look out for me, but you can't worry
That every time something goes wrong, I'm gonna drink.
I'm gonna stay here.
But I will go to a meeting with you tomorrow morning.
I promise.
Thank you.
I know that you were there for patty, but--
I was there for the both of you.
You helped that woman.
I miss you, nai.
I really miss you.
And when you took patty's hand in there
And told her that she wasn't alone, it broke my heart,
Because I am alone.
Somewhere...
Along the way, you let go of my hands.
And being alone, it just sucks.
I want my best friend back.
You want to get a drink?
Yeah, I do.
I do.
But, um, can I bring some wine over later?
Sure.
You have plans?
Um...
What I have are a lot of opinions.
It's time for me to act on 'em.
What if she doesn't wake up?
Betsey's tough.
She'll come out okay.
What?
You.
You never struck me as the kid-friendly type.
Yeah, I used to think that anything
That took me away from the lab was a waste of time.
But now...
I don't know.
I guess I can see the advantages
Of making space in my life for others.
I can't go with you.
I love you, naomi.
And I'm not sorry I came back for you, 'cause I do believe you have to stand up
For the things that truly matter.
But you also gotta recognize when you've lost.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
She's gonna wake up, right?
She has to.
I'm lucky to have you, coop.
I don't ever want it to seem like I take you for granted.
We can't take anything for granted.
Hey, betsey.
It's me.
It's violet.
You know, you're right to be mad at me.
Your dad would be so mad at me, too.
It's sad that the only way I can talk to you
Is when you can't hear me.
But I don't know.
Maybe you can.
okay.
I'm sorry that I lied to you.
I didn't want to, but, uh...
I was afraid that if I told you
That foster care was...
I mean, if you thought that where you were going
Wasn't safe and happy and full of love,
Then it would make it harder for you to go.
Or maybe it would just make it harder
For me to see you leave.
I don't know.
But...
You have to know that I care.
And I wanted to help.
I mean, I want to help now.
So...
So...
I promise you
That I am going to find some people for you to live with
Who will give you all the love that you deserve.
And I'm not gonna give up this time, okay?
So you better not give up either, 'cause you have... you have so much life ahead of you
And you have so many beautiful things
To look forward to... but you have to wake up.

I have to go to work.
And I feel used.
Gabriel, we were at a wedding.
We got carried away.
That's all.
Move to D.C. with me.
Oh, thanks.
That's where I'm going, too.
The doctors there aren't expensive, are they?
I'm already working doubles at a bar to put myself through grad school.
Don't worry.
Our patients are our first priority.
So you're one of the doctors?
Yes.
I'm Dr. Montgomery.
Oh, you're the one I'm coming to see.
I'm Patty... oh!
- Patty, what is it?
- Oh, my stomach.
Oh.
Okay, okay.
It's okay.
It's okay, Patty.
What did you give me?
I...
I feel better.
It's an antiemetic.
It helps with the nausea.
Mm.
It's tender?
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna do an ultrasound.
Have you had any other symptoms lately, any recent changes in health?
Patty, what is it?
I had an abortion two months ago.
I...
I tried to go to this clinic, but outside were all these...
Protestors?
The things they were yelling... calling me a murderer, a... a baby killer.
I couldn't go in.
I tried to find a private doctor, but most of them won't do abortions.
I'm lucky my girlfriend knew a doctor who would.
Yeah.
Well, it's hard to do your job when you're getting death threats.
Some doctors aren't even trained in the procedure anymore.
I want kids.
I do.
Just not now.
I mean, babies are expensive.
Kids need time and attention.
It seemed wrong to bring one into the world I couldn't do right by.
Patty, you don't have to justify your decision to me.
The doctor told me I might have some cramping and tenderness, but I didn't expect to feel this bad.
Okay, let's take a look.
What is it?
Is something wrong?
Patty, I'm sorry.
Uh... you're still pregnant.
The fetus looks to be about 19 weeks.
But this...
I...
I can't.
I...
I can't be pregnant.
Charlie and I, we used a condom.
I had an abortion.
Sometimes when an abortion is done early, the pregnancy is so small that the doctor can miss the embryonic tissue when removing it from the uterus.
But I got drunk last weekend.
I...
I smoked two packs of cigarettes.
You have to do something.
You can just do it again, right?
Patty, you need to understand that this isn't just tissue.
You're carrying a fetus now, and the procedure is much more difficult.
What would you have to do to me?
There's something called laminaria... seaweed sticks that absorb fluid and swell.
They would be inserted into your cervix to help it dilate.
24 hours later, you would be brought back in, put under general anesthesia, and the fetus would be removed using forceps and suction.
- Could the baby survive?
- No, not at 19 weeks.
A baby needs to be at least 24 weeks to survive outside the uterus.
The fetus would die during the procedure.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Look, uh, there are other options.
You can carry the baby to term...
Don't you think I considered all the options last time?
I can't carry a child.
I am on my feet eight hours a day.
I have no money.
God, I'm pregnant.
Look, I, uh...
I know that this is a shock, so why don't you take some time, think about what you want to do?
Okay, say hello to a... married man.
- Hey.
- Hey.
If two people get married, and you don't actually witness it, did it really happen?
- Sorry about that.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, congratulations.
- Thank you.
- Hey, any, uh, any word from the medical board?
Well, I still have my license, so I have every right to be here.
Wait.
That's... that's not what I meant.
I...
Sometimes I hate being a doctor.
My new patient... she's 19 weeks pregnant
- and she may want an abortion.
- A partial-birth abortion?
Partial-birth is not a medical term.
- It's political, and you know it.
- Okay, late-term abortion, second-trimester, DE... who cares what you call it?
You can't do it.
Yes, she can.
It's at the doctor's discretion, and it is legal.
Did you even counsel her on her options?
She was counseled before her first abortion.
Her first abortion?
Is she using the procedure as birth control?
No, she used condoms, and why are you judging?
- I...
- There is no judgment from us.
We are doctors, and we all know birth control sometimes fails, and I didn't want to tell her this because I knew it would freak her out, but the doctor she went to the first time was a quack who didn't know what the hell he was doing,
and now she's come to me, and my job is to help her.
And how'd you leave it with her?
She's gonna think about it and then make her choice.
Well, maybe the choice has already been made.
What the hell does that mean?
Well, I mean, condoms are usually effective, and the stats on failed abortions are negligible, so maybe this baby was meant to live.
You want to force a woman to give birth and raise a child
- that she clearly doesn't want?
- Well, after what she did,
- Patty should probably give the baby up for adoption.
- What she did... was exercise her legal right to choose.
Hey.
Hey, Pete.
- So if she comes back, what are you gonna do?
- I have no idea.
Oh, my God.
It's Betsey.
She's in the E.R.
My head hurts.
I know, baby.
That was a big fall.
I was in the kitchen cooking, and I just...
- I should've been watching her.
- You have to fix her.
I will, Marshall.
I promise.
I don't like it here.
Oh, baby, no one likes hospitals, but the doctors are gonna make you better.
No.
My mommy and daddy died here.
Everybody dies here.
Is she all right?
- Her vitals are stable.
- Any loss of consciousness or focal neuro signs?
- Exam was negative.
- C-spine?
Clear.
We're waiting on C.T. and portable chest.
I thought social services placed her with a family in Riverside.
Yeah.
What is she... what is she doing here in St. Ambrose?
Her family moved to the Westside a few months ago.
She's been right here?
C.T. shows an extensive contusion in the left temporal region.
- D... does that mean surgery?
- The swelling could go down on its own.
We'll need to monitor her closely for the next few days.
Any other injuries or signs of trauma?
No.
X-ray looks good.
No broken bones.
Just a healed clavicle fracture.
Looks a couple months old.
Wait, Betsey broke her collarbone two months ago, and now she falls down the stairs?
Now we shouldn't jump to any conclusions.
Okay, I do this every day, Sheldon, and to me, that sounds like abuse.
Cooper, you cannot jump to abuse.
- We should have social services make an assessment.
- No.
- Well, then what do you think we should do?
- We can't leave her with those people.
If you guys had just taken her when she got left in the office.
What, then this wouldn't have happened?
Oh, come on.
It's not like you took her.
Guys, this isn't helping.
Okay, Pete, you met the parents.
What did you think?
They were loving and concerned, and Betsey is clearly very attached.
Well, to Betsey, any parents are good, even bad ones.
If they're abusing her...
- We have to get her out of that house.
- I broke 4 bones by the time I was 10.
- Kids fall all the time.
- Okay, look, it seems like Betsey has found a really good family.
We cannot risk ruining that unless we have concrete proof.
Well, let's get some.
Cooper!
Hi, I'm Dr. Cooper Freedman.
Hi.
Hi.
And this is Dr. Violet Turner.
- We, uh, used to work with Betsey's dad.
- Oh.
- Naomi!
- Hey, sweetie.
Phil and Gina Rakoff.
Behind the video game, that's our son Marshall.
Hi.
I'm Dr. Naomi Bennett.
Betsey, look how popular you are... all these visitors.
Uh, why don't we step over here so I can update you on what's going on?
I'm so glad to see you.
Why didn't you visit me?
I...
I wanted to.
I did.
But...
I don't want to talk to you.
It's okay.
Hi, sweetie.
So how do you like your new family?
That fall must have been scary, huh?
You did fall, right, sweetie?
Sweetie, did somebody hurt you?
No.
How about... how about when you... when you broke the bone?
I...
I fell off the jungle gym.
Betsey, listen, even if somebody told you not to, you can tell me, okay?
I love you.
We all love you here.
But you sent me away.
What's the matter, honey?
What's going on?
Why is she upset?
Um, to be perfectly honest, I'm concerned about this fall that seems to have come right on the heels of the other accident
- where she broke the clavicle.
- Kids fall.
Yes, they do, but two severe ones so close together, it's...
Are you accusing us of hurting her?
We love Betsey.
You have no right.
Don't be mean to my mommy.
You're upsetting our children, and you're both way outta line.
Get the hell out and don't come back.
Poor kid, huh?
Yeah, I suppose, uh, we made our bed.
What, you think this is our fault?
I think that we... all of us at the practice... we make decisions and... we don't think about the consequences.
All I can think about lately are consequences.
This Patty thing's really killing you.
- I'm fine.
- You're not fine.
You want to have a baby.
You want a baby so bad that we broke up, and now...
In a few weeks, that fetus could be... a baby.
Not just a collection of cells, but a baby, and, uh...
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
- I should go.
- Mm-hmm.
When I offered to take you to lunch, the hospital cafeteria wasn't exactly what I had in mind.
Yes, well, I need to be here right now.
And I only have a half an hour.
I gotta pick up Olivia.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm happy to see you as much as possible.
Don't.
Do not ask me about D.C. again, okay?
Not now.
Betsey's in I.C.U.,
Addison may be performing an abortion on a woman who is 19 weeks pregnant.
Hmm.
Late-term by definition, but certainly not illegal.
I mean, I can see how that might frustrate someone whose work is creating life.
That's a careful response.
- You don't agree with me.
- A fetus may be a life, but it's not a biologically independent life, so in my mind and in the mind of the supreme court, the right of termination belongs to the mother.
Well, thank you for the civics lesson.
Maybe you should offer to assist Addison.
If I felt that strongly about it, I would.
You know me.
I'm all about going after what you believe in as hard as possible.
- She hates me.
- Betsey does not hate you.
Of course she hates me.
I'm the one who sent her away.
I'm the one who looked that little girl in the eye and sold her a-a fairy tale about how marvelous her new life was gonna be because I couldn't tell her the truth.
And now her foster parents could be hurting her.
For all we know, she did fall.
But we don't know, do we?
It's just too much.
First, Betsey loses her parents, and then her aunt drops her off here like a package that was tossed into the trash by us, the people who were supposed to care, and now tack on abuse...
I...
I had an obligation to take care of Dell's little girl.
Look, you've gotta stop beating yourself up.
Or is it me that you blame for all this?
Well, right now I'm the one being blamed, by Betsey, and that's all I can think about.
Can I go home soon?
We're working on it, honey.
I told you to stay away from my family.
I'm not coming in.
She is.
- Gladys?
- Hi, Betsey.
Remember me?
Our little girl has a brain injury, and you called social services?
Outside, right now.
What are you doing?
She needs to stay calm.
For the next few days, our main focus has to be her health.
- I am worried about her health.
- Dr. Freedman,
I will follow up.
I promise.
But I think you're wrong about Phil and Gina.
It is oddly therapeutic.
Oh, please.
You are preaching to the choir.
My goodness.
I can't get enough.
Oh, but Maya's gonna be back soon enough, so I have to enjoy it while I can.
- Okay, I'll see you.
Bye.
- Huh, sweetie?
Say bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Is Dr. Montgomery in?
Uh, she's at the hospital.
She should be back soon.
Uh, can you tell her that Patty stopped by?
Uh, Patty?
Hi.
I'm, uh, I'm Dr. Naomi Bennett.
Would... would you like to wait in my office?
I have some tissues.
Okay.
I had a plan.
I was gonna finish grad school, get my M.B.A., meet a great guy who thinks I hung the moon, get married, and around 35, we'd have a baby.
Yeah, well, no one is ready...
ever ready... to have a baby.
It's just... you just do it.
You know, my... my daughter was 16 years old when she got pregnant with Olivia here.
She hadn't even finished high school, and I almost...
No, I...
I tried to force her to have an abortion.
And I'm so grateful every single day
- that she didn't.
- But she had you to help her.
My boyfriend Charlie... he...
he couldn't get away fast enough when I told him I was pregnant.
Well, that just means he's not ready to be a father.
I can't be a mother.
I have nothing.
I have to work all the time.
B - but being a mother isn't about what you have.
- It's about who you are.
- I can't have this baby.
I can't.
I already got an abortion before.
- I can live through it again.
- It's not the same, Patty.
At 19 weeks, do you know that your child can hear you?
It can be startled by loud noises.
Your child already has vocal cords and fingerprints and air sacs in her lungs.
She can move her arms and legs, not unlike Olivia here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know you're confused, which is why I think you need a little more time to think about it.
And I promise you that I can offer you all the support you need to get through this pregnancy.
Just please... just consider... just consider... carrying the baby to term.
What did you say to Patty?
She comes here to see me, and then you scare her into changing her mind?
I didn't scare her.
I talked to her.
- You had no right.
- She needed to think about what she was doing.
This abortion could affect her for the rest of her life.
Any choice she makes
- would affect her for the rest of her life.
- All the more reason for Patty to be sure of her decision now.
Okay, you don't get to have an opinion.
You don't even work here.
Which makes the only objective person in the room.
The patient was made aware of her options, and she chose, end of story.
This isn't some clinical trial where we line up the pros and cons.
There's an emotional component here that can't be quantified.
It's not just emotional.
This is physical.
When you crush that baby's skull to get it through the cervix,
- it feels that pain.
- You don't think I know that?
!
- I don't think you care.
- Of course I care, but
Patty is my patient.
You violated the trust that I established with my patient... my patient.
You have crossed so far over the line, you can't even see it.
You know what?
I did what I thought was right.
Whether or not to do this procedure is not your decision.
It is mine.
I thought it was Patty's.
You didn't want to do it anyway, and now you don't have to.
Okay, don't pretend that you did this for me.
You manipulated a terrified and confused girl.
Preach whatever you want to your own patients, but stay away from mine!
How's Betsey doing?
Her intracranial pressure is holding steady, so no surgery yet.
Honestly, for once, I don't want to cut.
I get that.
It's a tricky procedure.
Besides, Betsey's just a kid.
And her father died on my table.
What happened with Dell was not your fault.
You don't really blame yourself, do you?
I don't know.
I just...
I've got a little girl in the I.C.U., and all I can think about...
All I can focus on is how badly I want a drink.
My mama always says,
"God doesn't give with both hands."
You're young, beautiful, brilliant.
Has to be something you can't have.
Some days, I'd give all that up.
That's just the craving talking.
- But the longer you go without a drink...
- I drank... at your wedding.
I thought it was ginger ale.
I spit it out.
Okay.
Since then?
Nothing.
But I can't stop thinking about it.
It was an accident.
Don't turn a slip into a fall.
Get your butt to a meeting.
I will.
I gotta go watch Betsey a little longer.
Hey.
- You okay?
- No.
You know, Betsey's just a kid.
She suffered a trauma.
So give her some time.
Time won't change the fact that Pete didn't let me keep her.
- What?
- Look, I'm all for blaming Pete when it's justified, but this is not his fault.
If you wanted to adopt Betsey,
- you could've fought harder.
- Well, Cooper, you've been married for what, like a minute and a half?
So what do you know?
Okay, do you want a shoulder or do you want the truth?
- Spit it out.
- Okay.
After Betsey left, you didn't visit her.
None of us did.
Yeah, but you judged us all for not coming to her rescue.
You played the guilt card, the responsibility card.
You made her your mission, and then the social worker takes her away, and... you know, out of sight, out of mind.
Oh, God.
I'm vile.
I am selfish.
I am selfish and vile.
Come on.
Violet, we all failed Betsey.
We just have to figure out how to help her now.
You have to know that we didn't... we could never...
Where do they get off accusing us of hurting her?
Look, we all just want what's best for her.
I should probably take Marshall home.
- You're leaving?
- I'm staying with you, honey, okay?
Hug your sister.
I need some help in here!
What?
What's happening?
10 milligrams of lorazepam.
She was fine.
I don't understand.
- What's going on?
- Her I.C.P. Is off the chart.
- We need to get her into surgery now.
- Come on.
I'm going with her.
I should go, too, but Marshall...
You both go.
I'll stay with him.
Thank you.
Will Betsey be okay?
Dr. Shepherd is the best.
She'll do everything she can.
You have to make her okay.
You have to.
You promised!
Make her okay!
Make Betsey better!
Make her better!
You promised!
- Marshall, it's okay.
- You said you will!
Make her better!
Hey, Pete.
- Hey.
- Who's your friend?
This is Marshall, Betsey's foster brother.
- Mommy says we don't say "foster."
- Of course.
I'm Sheldon.
Hey, can I join you?
Sure.
Now you and Betsey are about the same age.
Must be nice to have her living with you, huh?
Yeah.
It's fun.
Uh, hey, listen, I gotta check on a patient.
Uh, do you mind?
I'll be back in a couple of minutes.
Now I'm sure you got upset by what happened to Betsey, but the doctors here are very good.
They're gonna take great care of her.
Does your dad ever get upset?
Sometimes.
But does he get more upset now that Betsey lives with you?
He fights with mommy a lot more.
And mommy gets sad.
I don't like it.
Of course not.
You love your mom.
So what do you do to make her happy?
I'm an extra-good boy so she knows I love her.
I tell Betsey to be extra good, too, to listen to daddy and mommy.
When... when Betsey doesn't listen, does your dad do more than just talk to her?
Does he... spank her or...
No.
What about your mom?
Is she ever mean to Betsey?
No.
But sometimes I help her to listen.
How do you do that?
Is that what you did on the jungle gym?
Betsey's clumsy.
It was her fault.
And when Betsey misbehaves,
I guess that's her fault, too.
Must make it harder for your parents.
Yeah.
And that's not right.
So I guess it makes sense, then, that she needs to be punished.
I'm done with my ice cream.
Can I have more?
How's it going?
It's tricky.
The hematoma's on the tip of the left temporal lobe.
If I remove more than 4 centimeters, she'll have persistent speech problems.
You checking up on me?
Worried I'm not competent to do this?
Actually, I have complete faith in you.
I'm just worried you lost faith in yourself.
Sooner or later, this kid's gotta catch a break.
Dell did everything for Betsey, and it still all went bad.
Now why do you think having kids scares the crap outta me?
- Cooper must want 'em.
- Of course.
- He's giving me the time to get on board.
- That's nice.
Addison had to choose between having a kid and being with Sam.
Now she's got neither.
You're lucky...
To have a man like Coop.
I got it.
What's wrong?
Damn it.
There's a bleed.
I need to remove more of the temporal lobe to stop it.
- If I am off by 1 centimeter...
- Amelia, this is what you do.
Don't think.
Just do it.
I knew Betsey was holding back.
Yeah, but Marshall didn't admit to pushing her.
He didn't have to...
The way he talked about Betsey, his aggressiveness with Pete.
It's clear Marshall's been hurting Betsey.
Can't believe it.
The kid's only 8 years old.
Well, did... did Marshall feel any guilt at all?
He justifies his actions under the guise of protecting his mother.
And there's a pride he associates with being a good boy.
So the kid's a psychopath.
That's great.
No, no one's saying that.
Look, there's a reason why we don't diagnose these kids with antisocial personality disorder.
The prefrontal cortex doesn't really develop till we're in our 20s.
Sheldon, I know that.
But while the brain is maturing, he could be learning new ways to hurt people.
Would therapy help?
- Possibly.
- Well, maybe...
Maybe he just needs more love and attention from his parents.
Why are we worrying about Marshall?
Betsey's the one we care about.
Recent history notwithstanding.
- Naomi.
- We didn't give up on Betsey, okay?
You weren't here.
It was difficult and complicated, and you weren't here.
You need to keep Marshall away from Betsey.
What are you talking about?
Marshall loves his sister.
- You're not involved in this.
- Yes, I am.
I'm the one who promised Betsey
- she would be safe in foster care.
- She is.
There's something wrong with Marshall.
Who the hell are you?
Sheldon Wallace.
I'm a psychiatrist at the practice.
Of course you are.
Betsey's intracranial pressure spiked when Marshall was about to hug her.
She's clearly afraid of him.
You've never even talked to Marshall.
Actually, I spent time with him earlier, and I really do believe that he's trying to hurt her.
Wait.
What?
You interrogated our son?
He was trying to protect your daughter.
- What kind of doctors are you?
- We've heard enough.
Get out of here, or I'll call security.
How is she?
How's Betsey?
She's out of surgery.
She's stable.
But she's in a coma.
I've been calling you all day.
I know.
I just needed some time.
I just wanted to apologize for Dr. Bennett.
She had no right to upset you like that.
Anyway, I...
I...
I just wanted to make sure that you're okay and tell you that I am here, to talk, to listen, to help you in any way I can.
Dr. Montgomery?
I don't know what to do.
I can't tell you what to do.
I can only tell you that it's your choice.
Maybe it shouldn't be.
But it has to be.
Patty... when it comes to abortion, everybody has an opinion.
Everybody's gonna want to tell you what to do.
If this were 1972, it would've been a back alley and not my elevator that you would've collapsed in, because back then you didn't have a choice.
Now you do.
But it's still hard.
And even after you make the most difficult and personal decision that there is, it's still not safe, because you have some fanatic who claims to value life who can walk into an abortion clinic and blow it up.
Patty, you are the only one who knows if you're ready to have a child.
Everybody else's opinion is just background noise.
So if you want to keep this baby, I'll support you.
You want to give it up for adoption, I'll help.
You want an abortion, I'll do it.
I am not here to judge you.
I just need you to know that whatever decision you make is for you...
Not for me, not for Dr. Bennett, for you.
Hey.
Any word on Betsey?
She still hasn't woken up.
I...
I...
I know I wasn't here when Betsey's aunt dropped her off, and maybe I should've come back from Africa...
No.
We... we have Olivia to take care of and we're nowhere near done with Maya, so...
Well, as much as she'd like to think otherwise.
I don't know.
Do you think that she'd be okay if we didn't see her that often?
- Well, she might not go to Columbia.
- No.
On the other hand, New York is just a short train ride away from D.C.
Hmm?
Fife asked me to go back with him.
And a... are you considering it?
I know.
You don't like him.
He is an arrogant ass.
I mean, I...
I wouldn't pick him for you, but what do I know?
How you doing since you and Addison split?
Mm, I have my good days, bad days.
You think you two will manage to stay friends?
You think you will?
You're a good mother, Gina.
You love Marshall.
You spend time with him.
You take care of him.
You knew, didn't you?
He... he... he doesn't have friends.
He fights with kids at school.
He says they pick on him, but the other parents, the guidance counselors... they always swear, Marshall started it.
I knew he was different.
But you don't want to think...
I just...
I...
I didn't want to see it.
I thought if we brought another kid into our home, he'd have someone...
A friend.
That's not enough.
- He needs...
- More...
love, attention... more of us.
I love you, Betsey.
Wait.
Betsey can't go back in the system.
Marshall is my son.
He has to come first.
My kid would've been 6 this year.
A girl...
I know it would've been a girl.
Ella.
She would've been in the first grade.
She would have the same gap between her teeth as me.
If you have this much regret about your own abortion, then how can you go through with this?
I know that that may have been my one chance to get pregnant.
But still... for me, it was... the right decision at the time.
I do not take this lightly, Nai.
To try to separate what I want personally from what I need to do professionally is... killing me.
I want to strangle the doctor who botched this up in the first place.
We've come so far, right?
Then why can't Patty get what she needs... a safe and legal abortion without judgment?
Why does she have to go through this again?
Why do I have to go through this?
I hate what I'm about to do, but...
I support Patty's right to choose.
It is not enough to just have an opinion, because in a nation of over 300 million people, there are only 1,700 abortion providers... and I'm one of 'em.
Okay, Patty.
We're ready.
Are you sure about this?
Yeah, I'm sure.
This is what I want.
But I'm so scared.
I know.
I'm gonna take good care of you.
I just feel so alone.
You're not alone, Patty.
You're not alone.
Prep tray and foley cath.
You did everything you could.
What if it's not enough?
What if the amount of temporal lobe
I removed from Betsey damaged her brain?
She could lose her ability to speak if she even wakes up.
It's been a rough couple of days.
The hospital can reach you if there are any changes.
Why don't we go to a meeting?
I'm grateful that we are friends and that you look out for me, but you can't worry that every time something goes wrong, I'm gonna drink.
I'm gonna stay here.
But I will go to a meeting with you tomorrow morning.
I promise.
Thank you.
I know that you were there for Patty, but...
I was there for the both of you.
You helped that woman.
I miss you, Nai.
I really miss you.
And when you took Patty's hand in there and told her that she wasn't alone, it broke my heart,
because I am alone.
Somewhere... along the way, you let go of my hands.
And being alone, it just sucks.
I want my best friend back.
You want to get a drink?
Yeah, I do.
I do.
But, um, can I bring some wine over later?
Sure.
You have plans?
Um... what I have are a lot of opinions.
It's time for me to act on 'em.
What if she doesn't wake up?
Betsey's tough.
She'll come out okay.
What?
You.
You never struck me as the kid-friendly type.
Yeah, I used to think that anything that took me away from the lab was a waste of time.
But now...
I don't know.
I guess I can see the advantages of making space in my life for others.
I can't go with you.
I love you, Naomi.
And I'm not sorry I came back for you, 'cause I do believe you have to stand up for the things that truly matter.
But you also gotta recognize when you've lost.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
She's gonna wake up, right?
She has to.
I'm lucky to have you, Coop.
I don't ever want it to seem like I take you for granted.
We can't take anything for granted.
Hey, Betsey.
It's me.
It's Violet.
You know, you're right to be mad at me.
Your dad would be so mad at me, too.
It's sad that the only way I can talk to you is when you can't hear me.
But I don't know.
Maybe you can.
Okay.
I'm sorry that I lied to you.
I didn't want to, but, uh...
I was afraid that if I told you that foster care was...
I mean, if you thought that where you were going wasn't safe and happy and full of love, then it would make it harder for you to go.
Or maybe it would just make it harder for me to see you leave.
I don't know.
But... you have to know that I care.
And I wanted to help.
I mean, I want to help now.
So... so...
I promise you, that I am going to find some people for you to live with who will give you all the love that you deserve.
And I'm not gonna give up this time, okay?
So you better not give up either, 'cause you have... you have so much life ahead of you and you have so many beautiful things to look forward to...
But you have to wake up.
Violet?
What can I get you?
Vodka tonic.
But just one.
You're still here.
I promised.
Thanks for calling.
Hey.
I heard you were feeling better.
Where is my mommy?
Oh, honey.
I'm so sorry.
She loves you.
She does.
But...
She doesn't want me anymore.
Well, you listen, I am gonna find you a family.
I swear.
And no matter where you are,
I'm gonna be a part of your life... always.
Where am I gonna live now?
You're coming home with me.
She is?
For how long?
How about forever?
Really?
Really.
Thank you.
[ dramatic music plays ]
[ people screaming ] [ machine-gun fire ]
"To protect and to serve"...
that's the LAPD's motto.
But as most cops will tell you, sometimes you're lucky if you can just survive.
[ water running ]
[ gunfire ]
Man on PA:
Load six.
Rodrigo:
Holy shit, dude!
Great job!
It's really coming along.
All right.
Now we're gonna do a failure drill.
You know what that is?
Two to the body, one to the head?
Yep.
Let me show you.
First, you're gonna fire twice... a double tap to center mass.
You're aiming for the largest part of the body.
If he falls, you're good.
But what if he doesn't fall?
Then that means he's wearing a vest.
Which means he's serious.
You got to bring him down.
Fire once to the head.
Take your time and concentrate.
If you do it right, you'll detach the brain stem.
You all right with that?
- Yeah.
- Good.
[ sighs ]
Told you to be here at 6:00.
You're lucky I came at all.
What happened to all the stuff I got you last week?
Threw it down the toilet.
Just take the money.
Whoa!
Hey, two's enough.
What are you, a pain specialist now?
If you OD, it's bad for my business.
You're one of my best customers.
Man on PA:
When the targets face, you'll have three seconds to fire four rounds...
two right and two left.
The target will edge away.
When they reface, you'll have a second and a half to fire a head shot on each target.
Is anyone not loaded and ready?
The line is ready.
Four rounds in three seconds...
two right, two left... when the targets face again.
[ buzzer ]
Stay up for the head shot.
Don't worry about it.
You're a good shot.
Not as good as you.
Yeah, well, I'm out on the streets.
Detectives are still cops.
Oh, no, yeah, I mean... you're a good shot for any cop.
Forget it about it.
You got any advice for me?
You serious?
Yeah.
Not gonna get mad?
No, I'm not gonna get mad.
You're mashing the trigger.
Just like they taught us at the Academy... breathe and squeeze.
Thanks.
Oh, I'm Adams.
Lydia Adams.
Morales.
Rodrigo Morales.
Nice to meet you, Morales.
Nice to meet you.
Hill:
We got to be vigilant, okay?
IA's been up our ass with integrity checks all month.
P-2 in newton just got days off, no pay,
For not reporting a bum's... sorry, sir.
...for not reporting a bum's missing pair of pants.
So, do your job.
You do it by the book.
Just takes one bad friggin' decision to ruin a good career.
Okay.
Officer Nakahara is on forced TO,
So I'm gonna need someone to cover today's community-service meeting.
Uh, we'll...
w-we'll take it.
[ scoffs ] yeah.
Officer zermeno?
What about you?
I'm serious, sir, we'll... it's no problem.
It's the one on children's car seats.
We'll take it.
Okay.
Crommett and Luevanos, ride together in A13.
Everyone else, in your regular units.
That's it, folks.
[ chairs scraping ]
Hey, Cooper.
Sir?
You okay?
Yeah.
Lydia:
Here we go...
the frickin' man show.
How long before Fernandez cuts these guys off?
Hey, you know what?
Roche is Captain's cousin.
Hey!
Oh, so we got to deal with "animal house"?
Mm.
Mom's here.
And she brought her lesbian lover.
Oh, you guys are so funny.
What do we got?
Susan and Jeff Anders, 67 and 71,
Were getting a head start on some gardening
When they each took a point-blank shot to the face.
Neighbor said they heard a gunshot, then they saw...
saw their live-in son,
Kyle Anders...
late 30s, 6 foot, about 170 pounds... walking calmly down this driveway.
Mm.
She says your guy's a loner, kind of a creeper.
All right, gimme, gimme.
- We'll take over from here.
- Yeah, you guys can canvass the rest of the neighborhood And find out where Kyle is now.
Actually, uh, we're taking the lead this time.
Yeah, Fernandez says we can't rise to an occasion unless she gives us an occasion to rise to.
[ scoffs ] yeah, right.
Call and check if you want.
We need you to do some employer checks.
I'll take the first two.
You do the rest.
There are like 14 places on here.
[ cellphone ringing ] [ chuckles ] like I said, take it up with Fernandez.
Ochoa.
Uh, yeah.
No, no, no, no.
We're not busy.
Yeah, 20 minutes.
Thanks.
Boyle Heights.
Hey, guys, uh, we got a call.
Yeah.
So we'll get to these employer checks later, if we can.
Goodbye, mijos.
[ door closes ]
Pastor Blake.
You called him?
I told you we were okay.
9-treys threatened you this morning?
They came in during morning prayer.
Was anybody hurt?
They shoved Ms. Lawrence.
And did they take anything?
No.
So, two gangsters just came in here,
Rolled an old lady down the aisle,
Knocked over some stuff, and left?
They said they'd be back.
Back for what?
I told you, we're okay.
Back for what?
Their money.
What money?
Last week I found a bit more than usual in the collection plate.
How much more?
$40,000.
[ scoffs ] you didn't think that was a little bit strange?
Maybe something you should report?
I know.
I just...
I thought it was a gift from God.
Oh.
Well...
I guess God wanted it back.
I should have called you,
But we haven't seen you in the neighborhood for a while.
I've been busy.
I'm sorry about Detective Moretta.
Grief can be tough to manage.
Yeah, thank you.
You know you're always welcome here.
You want to talk...
I'm fine.
Don't worry about all of this.
It's being taken care of.
What's that supposed to mean?
Did you recognize either of them?
Pastor?
So...
Fernandez goes to some management-training retreat, and now tweedledee and dumber are in charge of finding a killer?
Hey, my kids didn't learn how to clean their room till I stopped doing it for them.
Yeah, well, that kid...
He grew up and shot his elderly parents while they were gardening.
Oh, you want more victims?
Hi.
Trust me, there's always more.
Hello.
This way?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Yep.
Morning.
Excuse me.
All right, so, where's the body?
Uh, County General.
She died en route.
Blunt-force trauma.
Hey, my money's on the skillet.
[ chuckles ] who called it in?
Uh, her 16-year-old son.
Where is he?
His name is Martin.
He keeps trying to leave.
See?
We didn't even have to wait an hour.
I'll talk to him.
Okay.
Hey, Martin, I'm Detective Adams.
Are you gonna ask me some questions?
That guy told me I can't go until you do.
Would you be okay with that?
I already told him everything.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna need you to tell me again.
I was upstairs in my room listening to my iPod.
I thought I heard a scream, so I went downstairs, and I Found my mom on the kitchen floor,
And some guy running out the door.
Do you remember what he looked like?
I barely saw him.
Okay.
Do you remember just anything at all about him?
Um.
He was black.
What was he wearing?
I don't know.
I really have to pick up my brother and sister.
My parents only pay for the daycare in the mornings.
What about your dad?
Does he live here?
Yeah.
Okay.
Um...
Where is he right now?
At work.
Can I please go?
Sure.
Um, Officer Herrero...
he'll give you a ride.
That's fine.
I'll walk.
No, he'll drive you, and I'll meet you back at the station,
And we'll wait for your dad to come and pick you guys up.
Fine.
Is this gonna take long?
She was in the RA Unit that took the victim to the hospital.
She kept saying who attacked her.
Made me promise I'd tell you.
Who was it?
She said it was her husband.
[ thud ]
Rough night?
Trouble sleeping?
Tried a glass of warm milk?
Always works for me.
Or a teddy bear?
Or a blankie?
Dispatcher:
Any available unit, see the woman, 459 report at Fountain and Beachwood.
A43...
show us handling.
I thought you hate burglary reports.
Gonna be a ton of paperwork,
Keep us off the streets for hours.
43, we show you handling.
All right.
Okay, let's start from the beginning.
Uh, somebody broke in.
Yeah, I was taking a nap,
And he broke in while I was sleeping.
Okay.
Was it somebody you know?
No, it was a Police officer.
Wait, wait.
It was... a P-Police officer broke into your house?
Well, I didn't see him.
I was sleeping.
But it just felt like a Police officer had been here.
When you were...
sleeping.
Yeah.
And you said he only took one thing?
Mm-hmm.
What was the thing?
Oh, sorry.
My Uterus.
Of course it was.
Your Uterus?
Mm-hmm.
Uh, Ma'am, when was your Uterus stolen?
John:
Uh, 10-4.
Roger that, Chief.
Yeah, we're on it.
Ma'am, we got a 187 in progress.
It could be the same perp.
Come on, partner, let's roll!
Let's roll!
All right, uh...
Ma'am, we've got your information.
Okay.
And we'll call you if we find any Uteruses.
I know it's unlikely,
But that could have been an integrity check.
IA's been cracking down.
If you'd been on time to roll call, you'd know that.
Nah, that chick was flat-out crazy.
Come on, next week, it's gonna be her Ovaries.
The week after that, her Fallopian Tubes.
Before you know it, we're gonna have have a whole reproductive system
Checked into evidence.
What are you doing?
Where's detective ochoa?
You just missed her, and she doesn't like anyone sitting in her chair.
Actually, I came to see you.
Okay.
Look, I know this sounds a little bit weird, but, uh...
I was wondering if you'd like to go out and have a drink.
You came all the way down here to ask me out?
Yeah.
You could've called.
I'm kind of old-fashioned.
You're too young to be old-fashioned.
What, are you gonna tell my mom?
Look, I'd love to have drinks with you,
But I just caught two fresh cases this morning.
I'll tell you what...
no drinks, just coffee.
You can talk through both your cases tonight.
[ sighs ]
Hey, Lydia...
I don't usually do this kind of thing, so...
I promise, you'll never have to go through it again.
Give me your number,
And I'll call you at the end of shift.
Awesome.
Have an excellent day.
[ chuckling ]
"awesome."
Thanks for coming with me.
Can't let you face those church ladies alone.
Those bitches are mean.
My mama's one.
[ knock on door ]
Raymond!
Shit.
Ma...
mama!
Damn!
Here.
Take him.
He the one stealin' from the church.
It ain't stealing'!
You a thief!
It's my money.
No, it is dirty money.
You gave it away.
I gave it to the church.
Listen, slow down.
Now, you talk to me.
I told him not to be bringing that filth up in my house.
I'd rather visit him up in the jail
Than go visit him in the cemetery.
Uh...
Bryant.
I'm telling you, I'm tired of him running my house!
This is my house!
W-what are you doing?
Everything okay?
You haven't answered my calls all week.
W... how did you know I was here?
We need to talk.
How the hell did you find me?
Your phone.
[ sighs ] I put a "find my friends" app on it.
N-no, no.
I-I'm a Gang Detective.
I can't ve a [bleep] "find my friend" app on my phone.
Okay.
O-okay.
I'll take it off.
No.
Sammy, are we having this baby together or not?
What do you want?
I bought a book.
It's about co-parenting.
It says that
If you paint the walls of the baby's room the same color,
The baby might not even notice it's in two different places.
And you get to pick the color.
I don't have a nursery.
If you want the baby to stay with you, get one.
[ sighs ] okay.
[ groaning ]
John.
John!
Community meeting?
Stuff's in the trunk.
Me?
Never done one before.
[ chuckles ]
Can I get you a pillow?
[ sighs ] fine.
Can't be that hard.
[ door slams ]
Morning.
Uh, so, uh, today we're learning about car seats.
Um...
Uh...
First thing you wanto do
Is you want to attach the car seat to the...
The, uh...
the apparatus here.
Maybe it... no.
[ chuckles nervously ] [ car seat clicks ] there we go!
The baby...
Is then secured to the car seat.
And...
Voilà.
[ chuckles ] [ applause ]
So, when you're done, if it looks... [ child laughs ]
Mr. Estrada.
I'm Detective Adams.
This is Detective Ochoa.
We're sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
Thanks for bringing the kids in, but they're tired, so I'm gonna take them home.
Yeah, you've all been through a lot,
And we hate to keep you any longer today,
But would you mind answering some questions for us?
Sure, but I wasn't there,
- so I don't know how I could help.
- Yeah, we just would like to talk
- to you in the other room.
- I don't know anything!
Mr. Estrada, please.
They're tired!
We need to go!
Please, mr.
Estrada, just let us ask you...
Look, I'll come back tomorrow!
Come here, baby.
There we go.
Wait, wait.
Don't, don't, don't.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Take those off!
Take them off!
Cálmate, Martin!
Itoldyouhedidn 'tdoit !
I told you it was some black guy!
Martin, cálmate.
No en frente los niños, ¿sí?
You're under arrest for the murder of your wife, Yesenia.
You're gonna let them do that?
You have a right to remain silent.
Do you understand?
Sit down, Martin.
He didn't do it!
[ clatters ]
Are you okay, sweetie?
Are you okay?
[ sighs ]
[ Martin crying ]
Martin, I'm sorry.
I thought you wanted to help us.
Josie:
All right.
What?
I didn't do it.
Yeah, well, who else could it have been?
I don't know.
Lots of people.
My wife wasn't too popular.
Lydia:
Yeah, e know.
We talked to the neighbors.
She had problems, but so did you at some time, right?
I'm clean.
I'm trying to be better now...
for my kids.
Oh, that's great, but right now,
The best thing that you can do
Is tell the truth for your kids.
Right before she died, your wife told a witness
That you were the one who attacked her.
We checked with your work.
You called in sick today.
Can I have a lawyer?
[ sighs ]
[ exhales sharply ]
So, what happens next?
Well, we're gonna know in a couple days.
Okay.
I'm gonna take my brother and sister to my aunt's house.
Oh, wait.
What aunt?
My aunt Alma's?
No, you're gonna wait here for DCFS to get here.
No, we don't need them.
We're fine.
Um, we have a place to stay.
I'm sorry.
We can't let you go.
What?
Not alone.
We'll drive you.
No, thanks.
No, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute, Martin.
It's not an option.
Either you wait here for DCFS, or we'll drive you.
[ brakes squeal ] [ horn honking ]
[ tires screech ]
Jesus.
Jesus.
[ siren chirps ]
Sir!
Driver!
Stop your vehicle.
John!
Cover?
Sir?
S-sir!
Shit.
What the [bleep] man?
!
Just shoot him.
[ sighs ]
Driver of the burgundy Chevrolet,
Stop your vehicle.
We're the police.
We're flashing red-and-blue lights.
We will arrest you.
[ whistling ]
Stop your vehicle!
Cover me!
Get out of the damn car!
[ club bangs ] sir.
S...
Sir, roll down your window.
Hey!
Sir, stop the vehicle.
Sir, stop the vehicle!
[ banging continues ] John, take it easy.
He can't hear...
You wanted me out of the car?
I'm out of the car.
Dummy!
Hey!
You're gonna break the win...
Hey, dummy!
John, chill out!
Hey!
John!
Jesus, he's an old...
Sir?
Sir!
Stop the vehicle!
[ brakes squeal ] [ engine shuts off ]
You're too old to drive, grandpa!
That's how you stop a [bleep] car.
There.
That's it.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
You can go.
We're good now.
No, let's just get out and make sure she's here.
We're fine.
Thanks.
Wait!
I, um... actually, I...
I don't think this is it.
Um...
Maybe it's down the street.
But we can walk down there ourselves.
Thank you.
No, we'll drive.
It's okay.
You can just show us which house it is.
You know what?
I...
I-I don't...
I don't remember.
Uh, maybe you guys can just drive us back to the house.
I can look at my mom's address book.
I bet it's in there.
Martin?
Yes?
Do you really have an aunt?
Yes.
I promise.
It's okay if you don't.
We can just go back to the station.
No.
I really do.
I have an aunt.
And I know where she lives.
Josie:
So, where does she live?
That blue house...
Over there.
But don't bother.
She doesn't want us.
She hates us.
Why would you say that?
My mom stole from her.
[ brakes squeal ]
I'll go talk to her.
Did she say no?
No, she said that she'd think about it.
Martin.
[ crying ]
Martin.
Martin, hey.
Martin...
I want us to stay together.
I know.
I know, Martin.
But listen to me, please.
Your aunt... she loves you.
She doesn't hate you.
It's just all of the things that have gone on in the past
Between your mom and dad...
it just... it has her nervous.
I can't help you...
I'm trying to be a good brother.
I know.
I want us to stay together!
I know, I know.
And you're a great brother.
But if you want me to help you,
You have to tell me what happened this morning...
For them.
It was my...
It was my dad.
[ John breathing heavily ]
Shit.
He's gonna be okay.
What?
The old guy...
he's gonna be okay.
Yeah.
Frickin' elderly.
His daughter's coming down to pick him up.
[ grunts ]
DMV should test every year.
[ sighs ]
A43... show us code 6, Hillhurst and Ambrose.
What?
China palace ... should be empty.
A meal break?
You weren't hungry 20 minutes ago.
Well, I'm hungry now.
Sir?
Yeah?
Sir, can we go off the record?
Okay.
Are you all right?
No.
No, I'm not all right.
I'm hungry.
All right?
So quit the bullshit and get in the car.
You know you're not alone.
I'm not alone?
No.
Why?
Are you gonna give me a hug?
"Look sharp, act sharp, be sharp"!
You know who said that?
My back... was bad this morning.
Really bad.
I took a couple pills, and I...
I guess they knocked me out.
You can barely walk.
They're pain pills.
I take them for pain.
Pain I got from doing this job, you pompous little prick!
You're falling asleep in the car!
You have a problem.
You need to take care of it.
I told you, I took too many!
John... you have a problem.
Look, in nine days, I'm off probation.
You can find another boot to torture.
Until then, don't bring your personal bullshit to work!
Your back acting up...
call in sick.
We back on the record?
Sure.
Get in the car.
Thank you.
Your so's trying to be a man.
He's trying to protect his brother and sister.
He's lying for you.
My son is a man.
No, he's not.
And your sister-in-law...
She's thinking about taking the kids in,
But she's terrified of you.
They don't need a place to stay.
They're gonna stay with me.
You killed your wife.
You are going to jail.
And if you keep claiming that you didn't kill her,
There's gonna be a trial.
Martin will be subpoenaed.
He'll have to say what he saw to a jury.
And if Alma thinks there's the slightest chance
Of you being acquitted,
She'll be too scared to take the kids in.
Then DCFS will have them, and they'll split them up
And put them in different foster families.
You love your kids?
[ crying ]
You do love your kids.
[ sniffles ]
Then don't make him testify.
Cop a plea.
If you just do that for your son,
I'll do whatever I can to make sure they stay with their aunt.
But...
You got to come clean.
[ crying ]
I just want to keep the kids together.
But you're their family.
I'm not.
You really want to be the one responsible
For tearing them apart?
No.
Come clean.
[ sniffles ]
I mean, you really think
That aunt's gonna take those kids in?
I mean, as long as the dad's in prison,
She should probably be okay.
Hope so.
I'm going on a date.
What?
!
[ chuckles ] [ laughs ] with who?
A P-2.
Oh, you go, girl.
[ laughs ] you rob that cradle.
[ laughs ] when is it?
It's tonight, after we finish
These employer checks for Roche and Manheim.
Oh.
You know, I still can't believe
We're doing these idiots' garbage work.
Yeah, well, you know what?
Maybe they'll finally learn enough
To know what's...
how to handle their own cases.
It'll be a lot easier for us.
That's for sure.
That is for sure.
Well, that's gonna be great.
[ gunshots ]
King 54...
shots fired on location!
[ people screaming ]
Hey, hey, hey, is anybody else in there?
Man:
Go!
[ indistinct shouting in distance ]
[ gunshots ] [ woman screaming ]
[ machine-gun fire ] [ people screaming ]
[ machine-gun fire ] [ screaming continues ]
[ machine-gun fire ]
Go!
Come on!
Get out!
Get out!
Go, go, go!
Go, go!
Come on, get down!
[ machine-gun fire ]
Come on, you guys, get out!
Josie!
Are you hit?
[ machine-gun fire ]
We got to get out of here, Josie!
Come on, let's go!
Let's go, let's go!
Shit!
Come on, let's go!
Thank you.
Thank you.
You all right?
Shit!
It was just the glass.
[ gunshot, people scream ]
Shit!
Holy shit!
Okay.
All right.
I got to go back in there, all right?
All right, let's go.
No, no, no, no!
Stay here.
What?
Stay here.
Um...
No, no, give me your phone.
What?
!
Give me your phone!
[ breathing deeply ]
[ thud ]
[ machine-gun fire ]
[ laughs maniacally ] [ clip clatters ]
[ breathing deeply ]
Man:
Whoo-hoo!
Who wants some?
!
[ cellphone ringing ]
[ laughs maniacally ]
[ breathing heavily ] [ siren wailing in distance ]
- And...?
- Ok.
[ laughs ] [ groans ]
You are so bluffing.
Oh, you think so?
I know so.
Then why don't you call?
You know what?
I'm gonna get my money back anyways,
Because you owe me a telephone.
[ laughing ] oh, no, you take that up with Manheim and Roche,
Because they're the ones whose suspect shot up your phone.
[ laughs ]
Ooh.
Ooh.
[ sighs ]
Hey, Lydia...
Yeah?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Ante up, 'cause I need some grocery money.
[ snickers ]
Jesus.
Mom!
Oh, yeah.
What happened?
Mijo lindo.
Mwah!
Mwah!
You don't train for this.
[ laughs ]
Hey, Lydia, this is my Rodrigo.
Hey.
Um, I'm gonna let you...
Okay, okay, okay.
...Go ahead and talk.
You're gonna kill me.
No.
Mwah!
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Mi corazón.
You didn't know.
No, I did't know.
That's why I kept taking your temperature.
Oh, is that what you call it?
Blowing smoke up my ass at the shooting range,
Asking me out for dinner.
You know that's not fair.
We never had our date.
[ scoffs ] are you not hearing me?
And you totally stood me up.
I'm not even having this conversation with you.
[ scoffs ]
And even if we were,
I was trapped by a gunman in a factory.
That's a terrible excuse.
Nobody's gonna buy that.
Hey, my mom's fine.
Let's go grab some dinner.
No, Rodrigo.
Your mother's my partner.
Hey, Lydia, we're grown-ups.
I am.
Okay.
We'll slum it.
You like salty or sweet?
[ chuckles ]
You know what?
I peg you for salty.
But I'm gonna get you both.
I'm a big spender.
I'm gonna get you a soda, too.
[ coins rattle ]
You like gummi bears?
Hey.
Hey.
So, uh...
Robin's Egg Blue...
Oh.
...Or whatever the hell it's called.
You paint here.
I'll paint my place.
Okay.
Now, the book says the color has to be exactly the same,
So make sure you use three coats.
Don't screw it up.
You got your own place?
I'm workin' on it.
Hey.
Uh...
So... [ sighs ]
You want to help me try to get this thing in the backyard?
What is it?
It's a swing set.
New people at Nate's didn't want it, so...
Here.
Ah, careful.
Don't scratch the truck.
Here, I-I'll...
John.
That's it?
You got nothin'?
Everything we said, everything today...
You got nothin'?
It's night.
Your sunglasses are on.

Episode 18.
Are you saying the Shilla captives have escaped?
Yes.
How could this happen?
Who would do this?
I regret having to inform you this.
I heard that a few days ago Prince Gyo Gi met with the the Tang envoy in private.
Gyo Gi did?
Are you saying this was Gyo Gi's doing?
I don't know about that but it seems that way.
Who did you hear this from?
As Gyo Gi's opinion seemed different from yours, I was afraid he might do something to hurt my trade.
So, I ordered someone to follow him.
Were you afraid something like that might happen?
It isn't that.
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
You are...
Your Majesty.
Are you all right?
We almost had big trouble.
Or is he someone you know?
We don't know him.
Are you feeling alright?
It was too startling.
We were almost found out.
It was my fault.
I should have confirmed his death.
The queen and the Daejapyong will be suspicious so, you have to be more careful.
Yes.
That guy came to tell us something.
It's also suspicious that Eun Go was investigating Gyo Gi.
First of all, we have to investigate Gyo Gi.
Mother...
What brings you here so late at night?
Did you release the Shilla captives?
Excuse me?
Don't think of deceiving me.
I know that you met with the Tang envoy in private.
You must have promised him... the release of the Shilla prisoners.
Is that why you released them?
I'm sorry.
Are you in your right mind now?
How can you do such a thing?
I thought it would be in our interest to maintain a good relationship... with the Tang Empire.
Are you saying you still don't know what you've done?
Do you know you are guilty of Jeong Jeon right now?
(Jeong Jeon - self proclamation as a king)
You can be executed for this!
Mother...
What other secret arrangements did you make with the Tang envoy, Lord Jang?
There's nothing else.
That can't be true.
Can you not be truthful?
Gajamseong city...
I promised to return it to Shilla.
But that is something I will do when I ascend the throne.
When that day comes, I will make an excuse and not follow through.
Your Majesty.
You have to stay calm.
You fool.
What else is there?
Perhaps, did you sign a document?
This is really important!
Yes.
This is a big problem!
We'll have to arrest them before they cross the border.
Who are you?
The king is looking for the prince.
I have his command to bring the prince.
Did you meet with the dae hin and make a commitment to him and did you release the Shilla captives?
Is this true?
Your Majesty.
I don't know anything about it.
Are you saying you did not do any of this?
I feel wronged, Your Majesty.
It's the document that you gave to the Tang envoy.
Isn't it written down that you would release the Shilla prisoners and also give back Gajamseong city to Shilla, while helping them with the war against Goguryeo?
Your Majesty.
Guards!
Yes, Your Majesty.
Take The Prince to the interrogation site.
Yes, Your Majesty!
Your Majesty...
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
I've been wronged!
Your Majesty!
I found out that someone had sent an anonymous report concerning Prince Gyo Gi.
It was all written there, about the Prince's self-proclamation as a king and about the secret document he signed for the Tang envoy.
Because of this information, the King found the document signed by Gyo Gi for the Tang envoy.
That's how he found out everything.
It's obvious someone deliberately put Gyo Gi into this situation.
Blinded as he was by the desire to become a king, so he walked into the trap by himself.
The king is not going to stay still.
What's the best thing to do?
Did you talk with Prince Gyo Gi?
Yes, Your Majesty.
First, when the Prince supervised the construction of the temple, he abused his authority.
So, he sought personal gains and thus he is guilty of abuse of power.
There is proof to sustain his guilt.
Also, in the document for the Tang envoy, he was self proclaiming himself as a king.
The document we found in the Tang envoy's possession, also contains the print of the Prince's hand.
Following our investigation, it was confirmed that the hand print is indeed the Prince's.
Everyone, listen to me.
The Prince has sinned, because he abused his authority, while he was in charge of the temple's construction.
Since he is still young, we can forgive him.
However, this is not all he did wrong.
He released the Shilla captives and he also made a secret understanding with the Shilla envoy, saying that... he would give Gajamseong back to Shilla after ascending the throne and that he would help Tang attack Goguryeo!
He dared usurp my authority, this is a sin we cannot forgive!
So...
If anyone wants to speak now on his behalf,
this is the right time to do it.
Listen, Gyo Gi.
You committed a crime against your country.
Nevertheless...
I shall let you live.
But!
You are no longer the Prince of Baekje.
As of today, Prince Gyo Gi... is demoted and he will be a commoner, without any ties to the royal family.
Also... starting today and for the future,
Gyo Gi is no longer a Prince!
Mother!
This son, Gyo Gi, has committed a great sin!
Please, please let me live.
From now on,
I will do whatever you say.
Mother!
Grandfather!
Are you listening?
Please, don't abandon me.
Your Majesty...!
This is not the moment to accuse him.
How can we let Gyo Gi live the life of a commoner?
Also, if Ui Ja returns, he will ascend the throne.
Now, there is only one way to stop this problem.
No more hesitation, we need to be determined.
Tonight.
Is everything ready, for His Majesty?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Prince!
Prince!
Prince!
You!
What do you mean 'prince'?
Aigoo, Prince.
Please take off the monk's clothes.
What nonsense are you saying?
Congratulations, Prince.
Also, I wish you a long and healty life, to be our king for many happy years!
You're returning to the palace.
I've been waiting for this day.
I knew His Majesty would punish Gyo Gi, but I didn't believe he'd allow me to go back to the palace.
The plan is unfolding faster than expected.
As Prince Gyo Gi is demoted and he will be just a commoner, of course you will be reinstated.
If things unfold too fast, the Sa Taeks and the nobility could react in an unpredictable manner.
If they are convinced His Majesty has abandoned Gyo Gi, they will try to reverse the situation.
Then what shall we do?
We'll meet now with all the people you contacted, as well as with the scholars you talked to.
Yes, I understand.
The fact that Gyo Gi usurped the King's authority and made a secret arrangement with Tang, is nothing but high treason.
But the Sa Taeks, in order to save Gyo Gi, will try to bury the whole story.
We must help His Majesty, or his voice will be singular in a Court dominated by them.
I understand.
We students will try to use our power.
We'll all sign a petition, denouncing Gyo Gi's crimes and supporting His Majesty's decision.
I leave it to you.
Yes.
What are you going to do now?
It's too dangerous for you to return to the palace now.
I know.
I'm not going to follow the king's command now.
I'm going to continue to stay at the temple.
So, Prince Gyo Gi is demoted!
What shall we do now?
!
With our luck, we sided with the wrong guy!
Bul Lay, what are you going to do now?
Shut your mouth.
I'm thinking.
Look, look.
He doesn't get it.
You have to open your mouth for air to flow in and out easily and that way your brain works better.
Open your mouth and think.
What did I tell you?
I definitely told you not to get involved with the throne business.
What did you do?
You didn't listen to me.
Nice going.
Will you shut up or shall I shut it for you?
I'll shut it.
Wouldn't it be better if we supported Prince Ui Ja even now?
Me too, I think it is a good idea.
First, I want to confirm that Gyo Gi is out of the picture.
Must you poke crap and taste it before declaring it crap?
Would you then say, "Oh, it isn't bean paste".
But then it's too late.
You've already tasted it.
Crap, oh crap.
It's so dirty.
Prince Gyo Gi and the queen are still enduring it.
The queen is the ultimate power.
They won't retreat so easily.
That's right.
Hearing that, that makes some sense.
Okay, let's reason this out some more.
As Gyo Gi withdraws, Ui Ja comes in as crown prince.
Then, the queen will definitely not stay still.
The queen will again call Gyo Gi. "Gyo Gi, come here."
She calls him.
And then what happens?
The king will definitely not stand still.
It will be mixed up.
It's all mixed up.
We don't know who is crap and who is bean paste.
You must know why we asked you here.
The king demoted Gyo Gi and appointed Ui Ja as a Crown Prince.
It's inevitable that Prince Ui Ja will be declared crown prince.
Please, don't doubt that we will follow you.
But we have no way to block the king right now.
The fact that Gyo Gi usurped the King's authority is high treason.
Does that mean you're going to go along with what the king intends?
I know.
I know you all doubt Gyo Gi's loyalty.
You are afraid of what Gyo Gi might do, once he ascends to the throne, even if he were saved now.
Are my words wrong?
Actually, I'm very disappointed in Prince Gyo Gi.
After what he's done, if he becomes king, I wonder what will happen to this country.
In that case, can you support me becoming regent until Gyo Gi is able to rule?
That is an admirable solution, Your Majesty.
Do you all think so, too?
With the Dowager Empress in Han as Regent, their country was prosperous, you do know, don't you?
Your Majesty, we will all loyally follow you.
Yes, I will follow you.
Then you must all know what needs to be done next.
If I am to become regent, there is one thing left to do.
We must de-throne the King.
They're going to de-throne the king?
That's right.
The nobles are already discussing this.
As soon as the alliance is formed, this is what they'll do.
They act exactly as we presumed they would.
Please, don't worry.
Before that happens, I'll get the king to a safe place.
If there is more news, I'll let you know.
Please, be careful.
As you said, please be careful.
If we cannot dethrone him, what about killing him?
That is too dangerous.
The nobles may waver.
I know, but we cannot wait till he brings Ui Ja back.
Moreover, he has to abdicate, if I want to be regent.
We have to get rid of that person in order to reduce the difficulties.
You must do this.
Yes.
His Majesty will be killed today.
You are the person Nam Ja wanted to warn us about!
You lied to us before.
Who were you going to send this to?
Is it Ui Ja?
What do you want from me?
I have nothing to say to you.
I'm not going to kill you.
I will torture you but not enough to kill you.
She's a strong-willed child.
She hasn't revealed anything so far.
If any of us is caught, we have to pretend we don't know each other.
Even if I am the one who is caught, can you pretend not to know me?
I didn't think it was you.
I believed it wasn't you.
Eun Go, talk.
Tell them you are not guilty.
Tell me we're wrong.
I
I am in pain, such a pain!
Is that so?
Does this mean you like me?
Then...
I'll ease your pain, Your Majesty.
Do you remember that scholar from the Royal Academy?
The one who wrote a petition, when Your Majesty incriminated Mu Jin!
That person was my father.
Do you know now?
I'm at fault!
I'm the mastermind in everything.
Is that so?
I'm surprised to hear that you're Han Baek's daughter.
But how did you endure it?
You had many opportuniities to kill me.
Why didn't you kill me?
I wanted to kill you.
A thousand times, 10 thousand times, I wanted to kill you.
But it was because you treated me so well that I feel bad.
Being treated so well by my enemy that I feel bad...
I regret it.
I really, truly regret it.
Who is the person who sent you?
Was it Ui Ja?
Ui Ja?
At first we wanted to collaborate with each other.
But... he is thinking about his personal matters.
He cannot be a guiding star for those who seek revenge.
Do you think someone like me, Eun Go, would accept to cooperate with him?
Does this mean I have to kill you with my own hand?
I... am in pain!
It hurts like hell!
I was so certain about tonight!
But... now everything is changed!
Take out all the things we are not using, we'd better sort them out.
It is the alarm signal.
The soldiers are approaching.
We have to leave now!
What's happening?
I think Miss Eun Go's identity was revealed.
You need to leave right away, that's our first priority!
I'll find out more of what's happening and follow you later.
What are you doing?
Why don't you come with me?
I have something to do.
What more do you have to do here?
All valuable merchandise has been removed.
What remained is unimportant.
You will not be affected by any loss.
Somehow, I have to make sure Eun Go survives.
What are you saying?
How are you going to save her by yourself?
Do as I said!
I am the owner here!
You've never obeyed me.
To the end, you don't obey me.
Madam!
Look!
Here!
This is a big problem.
If Miss Eun Go was caught that means she was trying to get important information to us.
I wonder what that message was?
She knew she risked being caught, still she tried to warn us - it must be huge!
That's what I'm saying.
What is it?
How would I know?
Go and ask the captured Eun Go.
Let's think of a way to rescue Eun Go and Young Mo.
For now, Miss Eun Go's life is safe.
Is that true?
But Young Mo's is not.
What are you saying?
Young Mo is not safe?
A while ago, Young Mo asked what should be done if Miss Eun Go is captured.
Unfortunately, I told her the solution.
The Queen caught Eun Go.
The Queen...
But...
I also heard a suspicious looking group of men entered the palace.
What?
!
No way...
The queen is going to kill the king.
Do you still insist on saying that you were the mastermind?
Eun Go committed no crime.
I'm the responsible one.
I rescued the baby and raised her.
If not for me, this child would have lived her life with no thought of revenge.
I brain-washed this child.
You are nothing but a merchant, what could have turned you against us?
If I tell you, will you let this child live?
Grandmother.
I'll think about it depending on what you say.
No, you can't.
Grandmother, you can't say it.
I'm the king's person.
She bit her tongue.
Grandmother!
You can't let Eun Go live.
Let her live.
Your Majesty!
But she can live only as long as the king lives.
Be ready to be buried together with His Majesty.
Assassins!
Rescue the king!
Attack them.
Yes, Your Majesty.
You guys!
Who are you?
!
Did the queen send you?
Judging by the fact you came unafraid by yourself, you must be Wee Jae Dang.
Please, forgive me, Your Majesty.
Please, go comfortably.
Your Majesty, are you okay?
I'm fine.
I never got the command to let you enter.
So, are you the one who crossed my path lately?
You did your job very well, concealing your true colors in front of Her Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Please, stay conscious.
Your Majesty...
I'll send for a doctor!
No need.
Your Majesty!
I give Baekje to you and Ui Ja.
Your Majesty.
What happened.
We have succeeded.
Well done!
But... our leader died.
I heard there were assassins in the palace.
Yes...
After returning from pursuing the assassins, I found him dead.
What about the assassins?
We followed them... but they disappeared before we could catch them.
But what were you all doing, before His Majesty got killed?
Yoy will pay with your lives!
Queen.
Their lives do not matter, but it matters if Shilla and Goguryeo find out what happened.
Then it would be very difficult for Baekje.
Your Majesty, please let me live.
Is there anyone else who knows this?
There were only maids and eunuchs from the palace there, besides us.
The country will fall into turmoil if word gets out that the king was assassinated.
Can you keep quiet until I say so?
Yes.
Your Highness!
Eun Go was caught and the king was killed!
What is going on?
Your Highness, do not worry.
We shall find out the truth.
Did the queen catch onto Gye Baek?
No, if that were true, she would have released the army to capture us.
What about Eun Go?
What about her?
I believe she was caught when she tried to warn us about the King's assassination.
The problem is the king.
There was word that a rider on horseback rode hurriedly into the palace.
That rider was Gye Baek.
I think he did that after hearing about the assassination attempt.
I'm worried that he was too late.
The king has died.
What?
How could the king die so suddenly?
I really can't believe it.
I can't believe it either.
Definitely, he was fine even yesterday.
How could he suddenly die?
There's nothing so unbelievable.
We checked for poison but there was no sign.
Come, tell us what happened to His Majesty.
Yes.
His Majesty was in great pain, so they sent for me.
His heart blood vessels were all blocked.
His skin was all sweaty and purple.
A heart attack.
I couldn't do anything.
He was already dead.
Inform the peasants that the king has died.
Prepare for national mourning.
Call Gyo Gi back, to attend the funerals.
Inform also the Ming envoys.
However... the one to conduct the funerals will be Gyo Gi.
Congratulations, Your Highness!
You are to conduct the national funerals.
Your status as a Prince has been restored.
My status?
The King is dead!
I'm sorry.
Let's go.
Yes.
We would have been in big trouble if we had sided with Prince Ui Ja.
That's so.
It's so confusing.
I can't tell who is crap and who is bean paste.
But can't you smell crap here?
I hate the smell of crap.
Who are you?
Who died?
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
It couldn't be me who is dead.
What's happening?
Didn't you say that he was definitely dead?
I couldn't ignore my own funeral and the loved ones who are sending me off...
Constrain the traitors!
Yes!
This country... for which they betrayed their king... you should protect it.
Your Majesty.
This medicine...
If I take this, my breathing and heart will be undetectable for a few days.
I will look dead.
Then, if I don't wake up within 4 days,
I'll be dead.
Your Majesty, how could you consider doing that?
This is my final chance.
If I don't do this, this conflict will never end.
It is His Majesty's last trick.
We are alone in this, so we have to find a way to replace the soldiers loyal to the Queen.
However, we have to get rid not only of the Queen's soldiers, but also of all those loyal to the nobles.
This is an opportunity that the king made with his life.
Even as Crown Prince, you will be under the Queen's supervision, a mere puppet in her hands.
I know that but right now there's no method.
How can you say this?
!
The national funerals are the perfect opportunity!
You are to conduct the funerals, so it would be easy for you to replace the soldiers with our men!
So, all we have to do is isolate the Queen and the nobles surrounding her!
Yes.
We have waited a long time for this day.
From now on, we will press toward the new world without rest.
There will be those who fall and those who will die.
Those who fall, we will lift them and bring them with us.
Those who die, we will carry them in our hearts and bring them with us.
There is a chance we may fail.
Even then, we will go together.
Don't look back and don't have regrets.
Go forward toward our goal.
Ahgassi.
Ahgassi.
Gye Baek.
It's finished.
We... we did it.
Is that true?
Yes.
Aren't you the one who promised to protect me to the end?
I'm here in this position as a way to fulfill my promise.
However, my 'end' is different from your 'end'.
Do you mean... you were also one of his men, right?
I made the wrong decision.
You all considered only the conflict inside the palace, but most of the soldiers are outside the palace.
I'll give you one last chance.
If you accompany me outside the palace, and I shall forget everything.
You will have a great future.
Perhaps.
Had my father listened to you back then...
He was a person you knew well.
The owner of this sword was this country's loyal servant, General Mu Jin.
I'm that person's son, Gye Baek.
Do you remember me?
Father, don't you know what happened?
!
Please, do not kill the Queen!
Please, save mother, father.
Was that so?
Besides you, Eun Go came to my side to exact revenge.
Is that your intent, too?
At first, it was for revenge.
But I've long ago thrown that thought away.
In the end, have you..
Have you returned like this, Mu Jin?
After listening to you, you're very much like the general.
Seeing even you blocking my way,
I think the time has come for me to meet Mu Jin.
Just as father didn't want to hurt you,
I don't want to hurt you either.
Even your heart is like his.
There's no need to go to such efforts.
You don't need to feel sorry for me.
You can't do that.
Who says you can end it so easily?
Because of you, my mother died.
You made me stab General Mu Jin.
You tried to kill my father, the king, for your own selfish purposes.
How can you die so comfortably?
This won't do.
Even if you die, you have to die by my hand.
This is what you've waited for so long, isn't it?
It is a much awaited time.
Finally, this moment has come!
That's right.
I can expect nothing from a cruel man like you.
Kill me.
You can't.
Move aside, Gye Baek.
Isn't she your enemy, too?
It is not good for you to take revenge over some private matters.
For the sake of your country and for its citizens, you cannot do it!
I know.
But this country, I shall be the one to reorganize it!
But you should not do such a thing!
I have to.
Are you really going to disappoint me?
I have no other choice even if I disappoint you.
I misjudged you, Prince.
With this,
I took your life, Queen.
Your Majesty.
Let's go.
Wait for me a minute.
It ended up like you wanted.
It ended as the people wanted.
I know I am all alone now, but I cannot help but think of our country.
As compared to what the Sa Taeks have done wrong, anything else would be better for our country.
So be it.
You're a lot like me.
So, you'll soon realize it.
The war is not over yet.
But I don't know if you will like what you see.
If only the Sa Taeks' ambition were not so great.
Many things would have been different and a mother would not have been taken away from her son.
That isn't so.
If that mother would not have been a Shilla princess... nobody would have had anything against her.
And we wouldn't have had to fight this long war.
Even with this result, do you still think you were right?
The same can be said to you.
You and I, it was not our destiny.
The day is nice.
I never realized that our Baekje's sky was so clear.
Your Majesty.
Let's go.
Let's go inside.
Now, is a new world beginning?
Now, is that good day beginning?
We'll have to make it so.
Now, you ahgassi,
I will not let you go.
Naesin jwapyeong, you're a loyal subject of this country.
I will repent before you sometime in the future.
Do you know who the culprit is?
It must be either a Silla spy or an assassin.
Yes, that's right.
The culprit is a Silla spy.
Let my death prove my innocence.
Who was it?
Who killed hyeongnim?
(Hyeongnim - respected older brother)
We can't let Gye Baek know.
General Gye Baek.
This is the secret document that the Queen sent here regarding Tobi City's strategy.
With her blessings, I was able to capture Tobi City easily.
And also, the price to pay, I helped her gain the acknowledgment of hers, and the Crown Prince's bestowment, from Tang.
Seong Chung is like you, General, a loyal subject, but what a pity!
Although we're enemies, I've admired you for a very long time.
If you surrender, General, I will treat you sincerely.
How about coming over to my side?
Right, the person who killed Seong Chung, was not me, Gim Chun Chu, but your Queen.
-= Episode 35 =-
Her Majesty said no one is to enter.
Move aside!
I'm sorry Your Majesty.
The General forced his way in, therefore...
It's all right.
You can leave.
Why are you behaving so rashly.
You call me rash?
Who's the one who actually committed the shameless act?
Are you a Silla spy, Your Majesty?
The traitor who betrayed Baekje, was it you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
The one who leaked our intelligence concerning Tobi City to Gim Chu Chu.
Furthermore, the price for that was the acknowledgement from Tang concerning yours and the Crown Prince's bestowment.
Seong Chung hyeongnim came to know of the matter, that's why you killed him.
Why?
Why is it you dare not look at it?
If look, will it make any difference?
Surely it's content will say that I am the spy.
So, do you want to inform His Majesty?
Go ahead, His Majesty already knows of it.
Your Majesty, General Gye Baek is here.
Let him in.
Shouldn't you be in Doksan City?
We have completed our offensive there.
Do you know about the Queen being a Silla spy?
Are you aware of it?
Yes, I know of it.
So, you also know that she killed Seong Chung hyeongnim?
Yes, that's right.
So how can you just let the matter be?
Then what do you expect me to do?
Do you want me to kill Eun Go with my own hands?
Your Majesty.
Would you be able to do it?
Could you kill Eun Go with your own hands?
Yes, if it was me, I would kill her.
We lost 8 000 soldiers because of one person.
They too have parents, wives and children.
Even if she's the most precious person to you right now, even if she was more precious than my own life at one time, to betray Baekje and bring about the deaths of 8,000 men, she must be held accountable for it.
I will pay that price on her behalf.
Your Majesty.
I will do anything.
Concerning the loss of the 8 000 soldiers, I will deal with it.
I will extend my help and save 8 000 commoners, 80 000 commoners.
Don't you feel apologetic and sorry for Seong Chung hyeongnim?
Seong Chung hyeongnim and I were different.
I left you at one time, but he stayed steadfastly by your side all this while.
Can you live with that?
I know.
Heung Su knows this as well.
But, for my sake, and not for the country's sake, he doesn't want to say anything further.
Gye Baek, can't you do that as well?
Just keep it in your heart, just know that Eun Go is the perpetrator of the crime.
You can do that also.
There's nothing that I can do.
I can't abandon her.
Is Your Majesty the monarch of just one woman?
Are you not the monarch of this country, Baekje?
Not just the monarch of one woman.
I am sorry.
Have you told His Majesty?
No matter what you say it's useless, my mouth will never say those words that you want to hear.
I've been a Baekje general for a long time.
I continue to live because of the love and respect showered on me by the people.
Whenever I return triumphant, they strew flowers in my path, to celebrate my homecoming.
Whenever they call my name, my heart fills up with warmth.
I've been able to survive on the battlefield, not because I'm capable, but because their families have said to me ten million times not to die, but to come home alive.
I continue to push myself forward as repayment to them.
I've gained much knowledge and experience on the battlefield.
Your Majesty, as Baekje's longtime Queen, what have you realized?
As this country's most precious woman, what have you gained?
Are you trying to teach me now?
What is it that you are trying to say exactly?
Heaven, and the people of this country, if they have given you your past glory, as a human being, one must repay this.
So, shouldn't Your Majesty also repay the people for what they've given to you?
General...
I won't do anything.
I won't ask for you to be punished, nor will I forgive you.
But please remember this.
Even if I don't do anything, Your Majesty will pay a price for this eventually.
Your Majesty, we have a serious problem.
Hurry up, you have to leave this place with me immediately.
What is it?
What's written here?
What does it say?
What's written here?
How can this be?
It says our Queen is a Silla spy.
Silla spy?
Is it true?
How can that be?
It doesn't make any sense.
Just to obtain Tang's acknowledgement, she sold our country's military secrets to Silla.
Seriously, the royal family has sold out Baekje?
If this is true, our Baekje is finished.
How can that happen?
How can the Queen betray Baekje?
The situation is far from good.
These accusations were pasted all over the walls of Sabi City.
This must surely be the work of Gim Chun Chu's spies acting under his orders.
Your Majesty, you can't return to the palace now.
We must keep away.
Where can I go?
Let's go to Silla together.
I was afraid something like this might happen, that's why I didn't kill my subordinate.
I've contacted him, let's meet up with him.
Then what about Hyo?
Hasn't Prince Hyo been sent to Wae country as an envoy?
We'll just notify him to stay there for the time being.
Your Majesty, please make up your mind.
What shall we do?
It's all the Queen's fault.
It's all because of the Queen that my son died on the battlefield.
What shall we do?
Stop calling her Queen.
If this is true, she's not the Queen, and not a subject of Baekje.
For her own selfish desires, and that of her son, she betrayed the country.
Your Majesty, let's get out of here quickly.
She betrayed Baekje!
Your Majesty, are you all right?
Let's go to Silla.
You have made up your mind?
We have to go.
We have to see Gim Chun Chu.
You've made a wise decision.
Your Majesty.
Your servant, Sa Taek Ja has something to report.
Last night there were messages pasted all over the walls of Sabi City, but it's difficult for me to speak of the contents.
What is the matter all about?
The Queen and wisa jwapyeong have been accused as spies.
Your Majesty, this could be a rumour spread by the enemy, but if there's any truth in it, then this is a most heinous crime.
We must start an investigation into the matter immediately.
Your Majesty, time is of the utmost importance, please let us have your edict quickly.
Jojeong Jwapyeong.
Yes, Your Majesty.
This must surely be Silla's evil plan.
Look for the culprits of this evil plan immediately.
Be meticulous in your investigation concerning the Queen and wisa jwapyeong.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Didn't you say she was here?
She clearly didn't go out.
Your Majesty, the Queen's whereabouts are unknown.
Your Majesty, we weren't able to locate the whereabouts of wisa jwapyeong.
Your Majesty, it seems like both of them have gone into hiding.
Looks like the messages on the city walls are true.
Order the palace guards to pursue both of them immediately.
Make sure they are brought before me.
Your servant complies with your order, Your Majesty.
Doksan City and Dongjang City, you entered the cities without any bloodshed?
This looks like Silla's plan.
To abandon the city, giving the impression that they don't want to fight so that we'll let our guard down, but planning a massive attack secretly.
Resurrection?
That's a possibility.
But with our alliance with Goguryeo, no matter where they choose to attack, they'll be similarly attacked.
Would Gim Chun Chu do that if he doesn't have any backing?
The one that Gim Chun Chu trusts, isn't it Tang?
Will Silla and Tang launch a joint attack?
Looks like I'll have to go to Goguryeo personally, and meet Yeong Gye Somun.
The capital is in turmoil, will things be fine if you are not around?
This is more important than that.
Rather than just one person, the Queen, this will affect the lives of all the people of Baekje.
Yes, you're right.
You must be careful.
Hyeongnim, you should also finish up the book on the art of warfare as soon as possible.
Yes, I will work harder.
-= Goguryeo's Camp =-
You came at the right time, I was about to seek you out.
Is it concerning Silla?
Not Silla, but Tang.
What is it?
Tang has readied 2 000 warships.
Did you say 2 000?
2,000 will mean they can carry 100 000 soldiers, right?
Just as you said General, Goguryeo and Baekje are sitting in the same boat through rain and thunderstorms.
(stick together through hard times)
Don't just look at the problem from Baekje's angle.
I hope that you're able to widen your vision before making any decisions.
I'll do the same.
That goes without saying.
If Tang were to attack using the sea route, there are 2 options to choose from.
One starts from the continent following the coast to Wuzhou.
Previously, Tang has used this route to attack us.
If Tang were to use the same route, then it's their intention to attack Goguryeo.
That should be it.
The other route is the Jeoksan route.
-= Jeoksan route: a straight road linking the Korean Peninsular to Shandong Peninsular. =- If it's the Jeoksan route, isn't that the route that was opened up by our Baekje?
Silla is occupying our Danghang City, the city that we lost.
Yes, the Jeoksan route is a direct route through the Yellow Sea.
If Tang were to choose the Jeoksan route,
-= Magpie Island: present Baengnyeong Island, South Korea =- they must pass Magpie Island.
If they move northwards they'll be attacking us,
-= Magpie Island: present Baengnyeong Island, South Korea. =- if they move southwards they'll be attacking Baekje.
Who will the Tang be attacking, Goguryeo or Baekje, nobody can predict right now.
On our investigation into Silla's troop movements, our spies have informed us there's nothing out of the ordinary.
What is Baekje's view?
As you know, General, we've recaptured Doksan City and Daeha City by just walking in.
They must definitely be up to something.
General, why are you back so early?
Let's go back to Sabi City quickly.
Hurry up.
Tang has readied 2 000 warships.
Is that true?
Yeong Gye Somun, more than anybody else, is very wary of Tang.
It must be true.
2 000 warships means 100 000 soldiers.
As it stands now, we don't know who Tang will be attacking.
Is the captain of the royal guard there?
Yes, Your Majesty.
We're going to hold an emergency meeting, call all the ministers to attend.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Do you want to ask about the Queen?
We've sealed all the borders, but we still don't know her whereabouts.
If she doesn't end up in Silla, this probably would be a good thing.
2 000 warships?
They've readied 100 000 soldiers.
Is it our Baekje or Goguryeo?
Who will they be attacking?
I need everybody's views.
Daejwapyeong, please start and let us know your opinion.
Your Majesty, this is something unbelievable.
We must first confirm whether the information is authentic.
General Gye Baek obtained this information personally from Yeong Gye Somun.
I believe General Gye Baek.
I believe his information is true.
All of you should accept the information that Tang is preparing for war as true.
The problem is, who is Tang going to attack.
Your Majesty.
it's not as simple as that.
We must first have an in depth discussion on this.
Then let's do that.
And please remember this, this is concerning our country's future.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Because of the Queen, the entire country is now in turmoil, and Tang is preparing for war.
This is really adding frost on top of snow.
(one disaster after another)
Fortunately we know that Tang is now preparing for war.
The problem is Silla.
We really have no idea about their movements.
It's better if we prepare ourselves in advance.
If they don't attack us, it'll be good.
That is also correct.
What is difficult is we don't know how to defend ourselves against Silla.
Yes, right.
Wife.
Baekje may be facing a major crisis, you have to prepare yourself.
Don't worry.
When have I ever been weak?
I'm more worried about you, General.
-= In the vicinity of Silla's border =-
It's the troops manning the Silla border.
From here onwards will be Silla's territory.
But...
Why is it we can't see any light?
Yes, you're right.
He agreed to meet us here.
Be still!
Where are you from?
We have been invited to come.
They look suspicious, seize them!
Yes.
What are you doing?
We were clearly invited to come.
We didn't receive any orders, you must be Baekje spies.
Take them away for interrogation.
Yes.
Aren't you going to let me go?
Who do you think you're touching?
Stop!
Greetings, city lord.
They are my guests.
Respected guests.
Make sure you treat them well.
Yes.
I'm sorry,
I'm late.
I'm sorry that I wasn't here earlier.
By the time I finished all my work, it was late.
It's all right.
It's a relief that you were able to come.
If you weren't here, we would be in trouble.
But...
It's a pleasant surprise to know that you're now a city lord.
It's all due to your credit, Sir.
For giving me a chance to perform meritorious deeds, and for saving my life when it was about to be extinguished.
N-No...
T-That...
I-I didn't do it.
It was Her Majesty's order.
I would like to meet the Tang monarch.
His Majesty has asked me to take you both to the capital city, but it'll be dark soon.
Stay here tonight and we'll go tomorrow.
Thank you so much.
Many thanks to you.
Really...
Your Excellency is my benefactor.
Now the both of you can rest assured.
Wait until Baekje is annihilated, then we'll give the two of you endless wealth and glory.
Annihilate Baekje?
So, is Silla preparing for war?
There's nothing that can't be said.
Tang and us have already made our preparations.
Tang's main military forces are already on the move.
Do you know how many troops they have?
130 000.
130 000?
Together with our Silla's 200 000 troops, we'll raze Baekje to the ground.
Baekje will perish.
You're both very fortunate that you've come to Silla.
Don't you think so, Your Majesty?
Now Baekje, will really vanish from the face of the earth.
No matter what, I can't let this be.
I must go back.
What are you saying?
If you go back, there's only death waiting.
Even if His Majesty were to spare you,
Baekje's destiny is now over.
Didn't you hear what he said?
No one can defeat 200 000 troops.
No, it's still not too late.
I must go and look for His Majesty and General Gye Baek, and tell them to make the necessary preparations.
Then we can prevent our country from being annihilated.
Just forget everything, forget it all.
It's a war that cannot be won.
Your Majesty, you're supposed to go with me to the capital city tomorrow.
You know that, don't you?
No, this can't be.
I must tell them.
I won't ask you to go back with me, but please let me go back.
Help me to get back.
Your Majesty, what are you trying to do now?
I came with you, because I want to use this potion to assassinate Gim Chun Chu.
Your Majesty.
What...?
I want to kill Gim Chun Chu, who has turned me into this.
I want to die together with him.
But... not now.
The place I want to die is not Silla, but Baekje.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
your horse is over there.
There are also no soldiers over there.
If you want to leave now, the coast is clear.
Your Majesty.
your servant cannot follow Your Majesty, I'm sorry.
Please take care of yourself.
No, Your Excellency, thank you very much for your help.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Where did you go?
The city lord is waiting for you.
Why are you here by yourself?
Where is the Queen?
I don't know about that either, she's not in her room.
What is going on here?
If Your Excellency doesn't know, who does?
Tell me, where did the Queen go?
It's true, I really don't know.
If you don't know who else will know?
Cad!
You're the person who allowed the Queen to escape.
Really...
I was too lax, thinking that I had her in my grasp.
Why are you talking like that?
Go and pursue the Queen quickly.
Yes.
She can't have gone far.
If you can't capture her alive, just bring her dead body back here.
What are you trying to do?
How can you treat me in this manner?
You came looking for your own death.
What do you think we do to people who are willing to betray their own country?
Cad!
What are you trying to say?
This isn't what we agreed.
Agreed?
His Majesty's decree is to kill both of you and send your bodies to Ui Ja.
Cad!
How did I treat you before?
And I even saved you.
Now you, now you betray me?
You despicable villain.
You are a spy, and you dare to talk about me.
Your Majesty.
you must take care of yourself.
Intercept her!
That way!
I can't die.
I absolutely must not die.
I must inform, inform His Majesty, inform the General.
What did you find out?
We can't see any troop movements.
What about the other side?
It's the same.
There's no news whatsoever.
There's also no news of Tang's army getting ready for war.
What about your side?
Also no news?
Nothing, there's nothing.
General.
Could it be that you're overreacting?
We've frightened Silla away.
And Tang, if Tang wants to attack, they will attack Goguryeo, why would they attack us?
Until now, they have not attacked us even once.
No, this situation is even stranger.
Allowing us to seize two cities, but still no news is forthcoming.
They're deliberately trying to make us drop our guard.
This can't go on, we must get the right information any way we can.
Start making inquiries all over again.
I've many informants, but even with so many, I'm not getting any news.
Really...
Cad!
This isn't a matter of just one or two cities, this concerns the whole country.
Aren't you going?
Yes, General.
Your Majesty.
what happened to you?
Your Majesty.
Cho Yeong...
Your Majesty, you've regained consciousness.
It's you, Cho Yeong.
But where is this place?
This is my house.
Your Majesty came here by yourself.
You can't recall?
That's right, it was me who came looking for the General.
Your Majesty, what has happened?
Are the rumours true?
I'm embarrassed to face you.
I must see General.
He's not here.
He's very busy and hasn't been home in a long time.
Then, I must return to the palace.
You can't do that.
And also...
There are many soldiers on the lookout for your Majesty outside.
Then, I'm sorry.
Can you go and bring the General here?
General.
What is it?
Please hurry up and return home.
Her Majesty came.
Your Majesty.
General.
What is it?
I am sorry.
I'm sorry, General.
I came because I've something to tell you.
Silla and Tang are going to annihilate Baekje and are readying themselves for war.
What are you saying?
Tang has 130 000 troops, in addition, Silla has 200 000 troops,
They're coming to attack Baekje.
How do you know?
I am sorry.
It's all my fault.
From whom did you get this information?
I heard this from the Silla army, but this is reliable information.
General, you must think of a plan to counter their offensive quickly.
Now, the person the people of Baekje can trust, except for you, there's no one else.
Where are you going?
I am a most heinous criminal,
I want to go and beg His Majesty for his forgiveness.
General, you must protect and guard Baekje.
Your Majesty, you can't go now.
I will take you there.
If you were to go out now, the people will react violently.
It's not necessary.
I'll go by myself.
Even if I'm stoned to death when I walk by them, there's nothing that can be done.
I committed the crime.
I have to pay the price for that crime.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, please let me accompany you there.
Was I not the one who attended to you from childhood days?
Our Eun Go agassi wants to atone for her crimes with dignity before His Majesty.
I will protect you to the end.
It's Her Majesty!
Her Majesty the Queen is here!
Step aside!
Her Majesty is here to see His Majesty.
Thank you for accompanying me this far.
You should go back now.
Go and convey to His Majesty, the most heinous criminal, Eun Go, has returned.
What?
Did you say the Queen has returned?
Yes, Your Majesty.
She said she wants to receive her punishment now.
She's in the courtyard of the main hall.
Your Majesty.
Please kill me.
Don't forgive this most heinous criminal, Eun Go, for her crime!
I have committed a most heinous crime, please do not forgive me.
For my crime,
I should die a thousand deaths.
Your Majesty, although you might find this difficult,
I audaciously request, to use my life, to atone for my crimes to Baekje, and to Your Majesty.
But... prior to that, I've something to say.
Silla and Tang, in order to attack Baekje, are currently preparing themselves for an all out war.
You must immediately ready your defensive countermeasures against their imminent attack.
What are all of you doing?
Take this most heinous criminal and imprison her!
Yes, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, please execute the Queen, for violating our country's laws and a multitude of other similar crimes.
Even if it was the Crown Prince, a member of the royalty, there can be no exceptions.
If this continues, the people won't just let it pass.
She must be punished severely.
She must be punished severely.
Your Majesty, the matter of Her Majesty's punishment is not urgent right now.
Concerning Silla and Tang's imminent attack, planning a defensive countermeasure against that should be our priority.
Didn't the Queen convey to us the information about Silla and Tang's intended attack?
If we don't come up with a defensive strategy to defend ourselves immediately, we'll miss the opportunity to do so.
General, the Queen is a spy conspiring with Silla.
How can we believe the words of a spy?
That's right, Your Majesty.
We can no longer believe in the Queen.
Didn't the General himself say that Silla hasn't taken any retaliatory action against us?
No, that's not it.
Even though they haven't retaliated for the time being, there are many things that are suspicious.
Your Majesty, it's obvious that Silla and Tang are eyeing Goguryeo covetously.
We shouldn't demonstrate openly that we want to start a confrontation with Tang.
If we provoke Tang, nothing good will come of it, don't you agree Your Majesty?
If we're going to reassign our army with the excuse of defending ourselves from Tang, the defence on the eastern border will be severely weakened.
This may instead allow Silla to attack us.
This could also be the Queen's devious plan.
All of you should consider this carefully.
Her Majesty still chose to return despite knowing that she'll be facing death.
The information that Her Majesty conveyed, has to be the absolute truth.
It's imperative that all of you believe that.
General, do you still believe in the Queen?
Because of Her Majesty, we lost Tobi City.
Weren't you the one who lost thousands of soldiers?
Your Majesty, we must not believe in Her Majesty anymore.
Regarding this matter, I will give it my utmost consideration.
Gye Baek.
Do you really believe in the Queen's words?
Your servant finds Her Majesty words very consistent.
Please believe Her Majesty.
It's clear that Silla and Tang are not preparing for war against Goguryeo, but their target is us.
But what the other ministers said, isn't it possible that Her Majesty is trying to deceive us with false information?
The Queen is smarter than most people, shouldn't Your Majesty of all people know that better than anyone else?
If the information is false, would the Queen risk her life to convey it?
I will go and see the Queen myself.
Why did you return?
Since you had already left... since you had left, you should have gone into hiding.
Why did you come back?
Why?
Why do you want to make me kill you with my own hands?
It's because I want to die by your hands that I came back.
The person who saved me was Your Majesty, and the person who can kill me can only be Your Majesty.
You have already betrayed the lives of 8 000 people, but now you've returned to convey to us information about Silla's troop movements.
Do you think by doing that your sin can be forgiven?
Even if I forgive you, the common people will never forgive you.
Your Majesty.
I, Eun Go, didn't come back to be pardoned.
I can't even forgive myself, how can I be preposterous enough to seek forgiveness?
I want to die, only then can the people's resentment towards the royal family diminish, that I know.
Furthermore, by my death, the troops and the people will sacrifice their lives to save this country.
The reason why I came back, is to protect and guard the people from the hands of the enemy, in order to redeem my sins.
So now... only now, you can see things clearly.
Eun Go, no matter how I see it,
there's just no way that I can protect you.
It's a fact that you leaked General Gye Baek's military strategy to Silla.
Yes.
What was your purpose in doing that?
Was it to obtain Tang's imperial mandate for yours and the Crown Prince's bestowment?
That's right.
Conspiring with Gim Chun Chu.
Is that true?
Yes.
Your Majesty, Jojeong jwapyeong reports, after a thorough investigation, the conclusion shows, the Queen, in order to obtain Tang's imperial mandate,
-= Imperial Mandate: the document that validates the Crown Prince's ascension to the throne. =- conspired with Gim Chun Chu.
-= Imperial Mandate: the document that validates the Crown Prince's ascension to the throne. =- She handed over General Gye Baek's military strategy to Silla, and caused the deaths of 8 000 soldiers who were defending Tobi City.
And also assassinated naedu jwapyeong Seong Chung, who discovered her crime.
All this was done at Her Majesty the Queen's behest.
Your Majesty, you must execute the Queen in a public arena before the people.
Please issue your royal decree.
Please issue your royal decree.
Please issue your royal decree, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, your servant Gye Baek seeks permission to speak.
Her Majesty has committed a heinous crime which is difficult to pardon, but please delay the punishment to be meted out.
General, what are you saying?
The Queen has betrayed the country, and if we don't execute her immediately, the people's wrath will throw this country into turmoil.
It's the opposite, daejwapyeong.
If we execute the Queen, would we not be playing into the hands of Gim Chun Chu and Silla?
I'm not saying the Queen shouldn't be punished, but our priority is to notify the people the danger our country is in right now.
It's not necessary for us to do what the enemy wants.
After this crisis has passed, we we'll proceed with her punishment.
Presently, this is the best solution.
General, there has never been a precedent whereby we can delay the punishment of a heinous criminal.
Then create a precedent.
Aren't we in a state of war now?
This concerns the future of our country.
If we act in accordance with what the enemy wants, isn't that high treason too?
General, please be careful what you say!
Furthermore, what do you mean by this is a state of war?
The information about Tang and Silla's imminent attack against us, was supplied by a spy.
How can we be sure of its authenticity?
Stop it.
Apart from Deok Sol Gye Baek, everyone else is in favour of execution, am I right?
That's right.
If there's a minister who agrees with the General, we'll postpone the execution.
Is there a person here who agrees with the General?
There's no person here who agrees with the General.
Your Majesty, you should just...
The person who agrees with General Gye Baek...
Your Majesty, is your servant Heung Su still the naesin jwapyeong?
Yes, we haven't appointed anyone to replace you presently.
Everyone.
I, Heung Su, resents the Queen more than anyone else.
All of you know that.
The person who I was very close to, Seong Chung, died at the hands of the Queen.
I, more than anyone else, wants to kill the Queen.
But, feeling like I do, I still believe that our priority is to save the country.
So, I hope that all of you will abide by General Gye Baek's words and act in accordance with his wishes.
Your Majesty, here is the book on the art of warfare that was left unfinished by Seong Chung.
Your incompetent servant has completed it.
Heung Su.
Don't leave here again.
Stay by my side and protect the country.
No, Your Majesty.
The reason why I came today was so that I can give to you this military warfare book.
I've come to bid you my last farewell.
Please ensure that you defend Baekje's territory.
The execution has been postponed.
Was it you who held them off?
That wasn't necessary.
All I want is to end my life as quickly as possible.
General.
I entrust you.
How can you do that?
It's not just your life alone.
Throwing this country into chaos, what are you thinking?
This concerns the lives of tens of thousands of Baekje troops and its people.
No matter how much you want to die, you absolutely can't die right now.
Is that so?
I, Eun Go, who wants to die, but
I can't even do that?
General.
General, news has come from the general at the frontier.
Tang's army of 130 000 are not heading to Goguryeo, but towards our Baekje.
-= Next Episode Preview =-
Gim Yu Sin led forces are now gathered in Namsan.
You have duelled with Gye Baek on so many occasions, but you still don't understand him.
It will not be easy to break their defences.
You must, please be safe and sound.
In retrospect, heaven has given me a very valuable gift.
Younger brother, you must come back alive so that we achieve our vision together.
I'm happy, my love.
My lifeblood.
Don't die.
You must live, just so you can return to your home.
The reason why you came to Baekje,
I know it clearly.
But there's one thing you should be clear about.
His Majesty and I, Gye Baek, no matter what scheme you have, will definitely not waver.
That was really unexpected.
I've come to ignite the fire.
I fear that you will annex our Silla.
Even if I have to give up half of Danghang City,
I had to come to impede your actions.
The person I fear most in Baekje is you, General.
Even if I had to meet you face to face, and feel shivers down my spine.
Gim Chun Chu.
Even though I can kill you right now, you chose to enter the tiger's den in your bid to save your country, I'm moved.
I'll spare you your life.
But remember my face clearly.
The moment you see my face on the battlefield, that is the day of your death.
That is the day Silla will be obliterated from the face of the earth.
-= Episode 26 =- His Majesty's idea of not using military force to subdue the enemy is very good, but it's not easy to conquer Baekje.
I think so too.
Isn't it better if we were to allow Gye Baek to launch an attack?
There are two cities in Silla,
Danghang City and Daeya City.
Either one of them will be easy to obtain.
The subjects of Silla can only try to flee.
Is His Majesty still worried about Gye Baek?
Of course.
Seung Chung hyeongnim, Heung Su hyeongnim.
Have you two been well?
Come here quickly.
It's been so long since we last met!
I rushed here after meeting His Majesty, but why are you so late?
I met Gim Chun Chu.
Is that so?
Gye Baek.
Buyeo Tae and Buyeo Hyo.
Among the two princes, who do you think should be crowned the Crown Prince?
Why are you asking me that all of a sudden?
Can it be from the Queen's palace, you've heard some rumours?
Do you think that I, Heung Su, asked that out of selfishness?
The princes are still very young.
It's too early to say.
In my opinion, this is a matter of the utmost urgency.
If we keep on believing in His Majesty, the world that we envisioned, may be getting further and further from our reach.
Gye Baek, I hope that you, will throw your support behind Buyeo Tae.
Even though he's not that smart, he's kind-hearted and will not distrust others.
Although he's not one who can make decisions by himself, he knows how to accept other people's advice.
You want a monarch who will abide by your words, because you want to be able to create the world you envisage?
Do you know how dangerous it is to speak such words?
The country that we had originally envisaged, is not one that is led by the king alone.
But look at how the situation has turned out now?
Look at His Majesty.
He's increasingly becoming more dictatorial.
He's more suspicious of his officials and his brothers.
Regarding this, doesn't Gye Baek know this better than anyone else?
Don't say anymore.
If you continue to do so,
I will not let you off.
It's fine even if the two of you refuse to help me, because I have already made up my mind.
This person...
Gye Baek has such an unyielding nature.
Furthermore, the king of Baekje knows it too.
Therefore, can we say that your scheme has failed?
Do you know what's so fearful about suspicion?
As long as it takes root, no matter how your mind tries to negate it, it will continue to spread in your heart.
So, let's shoot the second arrow that will shake the heart of the Baekje king.
Second arrow?
Your Excellency, haven't you decided to take one of the Baekje princes to the Tang court?
Haven't you received the Emperor's edict, that among the two princes, you must lend your support to one?
Therein lies the problem.
Will any of them be willing to give up the throne that easily?
Why are you making it so complicated?
Let me go and meet royal consort Mok once.
Even if you meet royal consort Mok, what difference will this make?
Has Deok Sol come yet?
I say, isn't this Cho Yeong?
But you, what are you doing here?
Is the General here?
General Gye Baek?
He should be inside.
But, have you been living well these days?
That, that, that child.
We haven't seen each other for the last few years.
How could she not even greet me and run off just like that.
I'll tell you once again, you must definitely keep an eye on Gim Chun Chu's whereabouts.
Do you understand?
Yes.
Your trip to Goguryeo, what happened?
Who am I?
She asked me to hand this over to you.
What is it?
They want to join forces with us.
Is that true?
Then, let me lead this time?
Cho Yeong.
Yes.
I know you are skilled in martial art, but you are still a woman.
I don't hope to see your hands covered in blood.
When have you ever regarded me as a woman?
Just stay by my side.
But, there's something that I don't understand.
What is it?
Why haven't you married?
I was married once before.
What?
To this sword.
I hope that you will get married soon.
Yes, I will also marry this sword.
The wine tastes really good, so good.
It's truly great to return to one's hometown.
All of you saw it earlier, right?
Everybody was clamouring to get a glance of me.
"Long live Lord Dok Gae".
Didn't you two hear that?
Therefore, in the future, you must use my stratagem to capture Danghang city.
Then, I'll become the rising sun of Baekje.
Who did you say was clamouring for a glance of you?
It's you who wants others to look at you, isn't that so?
And what else did you say?
The rising sun of Baekje?
Don't be Baekje's downfall.
And don't keep repeating that matter.
I don't care whether it's the rising sun or downfall, isn't it all the same, rascals?
Just you wait and see.
The more I think about it, the angrier I get, rascals.
It's all your fault!
I am a soldier.
One can't be disrespectful to a soldier, don't you know that?
I understand, you brat.
That's enough, rascals!
I'm already old.
An old person should die.
Fine, kill me then.
Just let me die!
Kill me!
Dok Gae Sir,
It's a joke, a joke.
Yes.
You know that all of us love you.
You even dare to wink, you rascals.
Don't love me, don't love me.
I'm so disgusted, you rascals.
Don't come over, don't come over!
Why are you grasping my hand?
Don't be like that, Sir.
I've no appetite, no appetite.
Let go of my hands, let go.
All of you are so silly.
You came?
You are here.
But Cho Yeong, about General Gye Baek.
Did he say when we're going to launch an attack on Danghang City?
How would I know?
Don't you know?
But why do you have that expression on your face?
Aigoo, I was drinking and put my lips on that side.
What's to done?
While drinking from that side, I was also licking with my tongue.
I see that you have decided to kiss me.
Therefore Cho Yeong, since you've kissed me, then you must marry me.
Will you marry me?
What do you think of me?
I'm the rising sun of Baekje.
Baekje's sun.
I'm General Gye Baek's left and right arm.
What do you think of me?
Do I look like a woman?
Yes, exactly like a woman.
What should I do?
Since you've already kissed me.
That feels so good.
Did you say this letter addressed to you came from Yeong Gyesomun?
Yeong Gyesomun wants to join forces with us to launch a joint attack on Danghang City.
Success is imminent.
We just have to decide on the time and date to launch our attack.
Hasn't His Majesty made the decision to cooperate with Silla?
We have to convince him.
That may well be, but for you to meet up with Yeong Gyesomun, may instead make him uncomfortable.
You may think that you harbour no selfish motive.
And that you will not be faulted.
But anything that you do, will be a big problem.
For such a major event, we should only act after getting His Majesty's approval.
Launching an attack on Danghang City is of the utmost urgency.
I want to make more progress, and to have to seek His Majesty's approval...
Gye Baek.
Do you also intend to fight with His Majesty?
Hyeongnim.
My eyes tell me you're going to do that.
I too hope that
Danghang City will fall into our hands.
But if your heart were to harbour just a little selfish motive, then I'm against it.
Regardless of what anyone says, the master of Baekje shall be His Majesty.
That's not what I think.
The master of the king, isn't it Baekje?
What are you saying?
Don't you ever say that again.
I know what you're trying to say, but just keep those words in your heart.
I know, but as long as we have the assistance of Goguryeo's military forces, our Baekje can possibly be complete for the first time in 80 years.
A great cause.
Go and convince His Majesty.
What's your purpose in wanting to see me?
The first time I saw you in Silla,
I should have been aware that you were the recipient of His Majesty's affections.
But I wasn't aware of it, and actually proposed my sister to His Majesty.
Please forgive my indiscretion at that time.
Just get straight to the point.
I'm still unable to forget the memory of almost dying, because of Chun Chu Gong.
Then I will not talk in circles.
To begin with, your servant would like to make a transaction with Your Highness.
Transaction?
Actually, His Excellency Jang Son has received a royal edict from the Emperor, to bring one of the Baekje princes back to study in the National Institution.
We are here for that purpose.
Your Highness, who do you think, among the 2 princes, Tae or Hyo, should be sent?
To send Buyeo Tae,
I'd have to ask for your help.
Furthermore I should take advantage of the situation while Buyeo Tae is studying in the National Institution, to get Hyo to be bestowed the position of Crown Prince.
Later you, Chun Chu Gong, will help him be installed as the Crown Prince.
Is that your intention?
I can't pull the wool over Your Highness' eyes.
Seems like it's unnecessary for me to brief you further.
Do you think I will accept this transaction?
I believe this isn't a disadvantageous transaction.
I heard the National Institution in Tang is proficient in varied fields of knowledge, and has excellent degree courses.
To a Baekje prince, this may be the best opportunity to gain knowledge.
Yes, that must be true then?
Are you saying Gim Chun Chu put forth that proposal to you?
So, what did you say to that?
Firstly, pretended to accept it, then sent him away.
You did well.
Now, as long as Gim Chun Chu goes and sees the Queen, that will do.
Gim Chun Chu wants to see the Queen?
Just like he said to Her Highness, he will make the same proposal to the Queen.
He will clearly do this.
He's a very crafty person.
He intended to drive a wedge between His Majesty and General Gye Baek from the start.
Now he's trying to drive a wedge between the 2 princes.
To let chaos reign in Baekje.
So this is his cunning scheme.
The Queen has recently met up with Gim Chun Chu secretly.
Make sure you inform the palace maids to observe and report every move the Queen makes.
Send more people to monitor the situation over at the embassy.
Please don't worry, all the guards at the embassy are already all our own people.
No matter where Gim Chun Chu goes, he will be unable to escape from the palm of my hand.
If it was me, I would use Gim Chun Chu as bait, to fish for bigger fish.
Your Majesty, your servant Gye Baek, will definitely launch an attack on Danghang City.
Please give me your consent to do so.
Didn't I tell you to first lay down your arms, as I've decided to join forces with Silla to govern Danghang City?
Your Majesty, please reconsider.
As long we lay siege to Danghang City, using this as our starting point, we have the opportunity to recover all the territory south of the Han River.
To share the city with Silla, and to join forces with Goguryeo, can you tell me what's the difference?
Furthermore, I've already agreed with Gim Chun Chu that we'll forge an alliance together.
As long as we can occupy the Han River,
Silla and Tang, will possibly not be able to liaise secretly.
Then, not only the Han River, but we'll be able to form an alliance with Goguryeo, and get an opportunity to defeat Silla completely.
Your Majesty, please give your servant's proposal serious thought.
Who has given all of you consent to liaise with Goguryeo secretly?
Don't any of you have any regard for my words?
And do any of you actually regard me as your king?
Your Majesty, that wasn't your servant's intention.
It's just that I felt what Gye Baek said were cogent reasons.
That's the reason for trying to convince Your Majesty.
So, my words are illogical?
Your Majesty, please don't distort your servant's good faith.
So Yeong Gyesomun didn't liaise with me, but discussed this proposal with Gye Baek?
Your Majesty, your servant said earlier that it was your servant who first raised this proposal with Yeong Gyesomun.
Keep your mouth shut!
Seong Chung, leave.
The country that we had originally envisaged, is not one that is led by the king alone.
But look at how the situation has turned out now?
Look at His Majesty.
He is increasingly becoming more dictatorial.
He's more suspicious of his officials and his brothers.
Regarding this, doesn't Gye Baek know better than anyone else?
Your Majesty.
Don't say a word.
Your Majesty!
I told you not to open your mouth!
Listen to me.
Are you thinking that I'm jealous of you?
Do you think I fear our situation will be one like Yeong Gyesomun's.
That I'm like this because I fear that you'll scheme against me?
The skirmishes that Tang is now engaging in with Goguryeo, will shortly escalate into full scale warfare with Goguryeo.
If we were to join forces with Goguryeo, it would be equivalent to simultaneously establishing two enemies, Tang and Goguryeo.
If we were to attack Danghang City, it would lead us to becoming enemies with both Tang and Silla.
Among the two matters, which one do you think should take priority?
Your Majesty, Gim Chun Chu is not a trustworthy person.
You must be on your guard against him.
From the start, he had foreseen Silla's defeat.
That's why he came to Baekje.
Who is your master?
The master of the king, isn't it Baekje?
What are you saying?
Don't you ever say that again.
I know what you're trying to say, but just keep those words in your heart.
I asked you, who is your master?
Your servant's master, is Your Majesty.
Then, you shall write a letter personally to Yeong Gyesomun.
Baekje will not join forces with Goguryeo.
You, Gye Baek, will no longer be in contact with rude and arrogant Yeong Gyesomun.
You can't do that?
You want to seek an audience with Baekje's Queen?
Yes.
I heard the Queen's late father and Your Excellency Jang Son, were very close friends.
As long as Your Excellency helps me set up the meeting, that will be enough.
Didn't you say that you had already obtained royal consort Mok's agreement?
Why then do you want to meet the Queen?
How can we just hang ourselves to die on just one tree?
We must let both sides fight each other.
Are you asking me to send Prince Hyo to suffer?
What do you mean suffer?
That's wholly inappropriate.
This is to enhance ties between our countries, and to exchange knowledge.
Isn't that the same thing?
Not only Baekje, our Silla and also Goguryeo,
Gao and Tibet as well, will of their own volition send their children there.
None of them thinks they are sending their children there to suffer, but on the other hand they are sent to a powerful country, to study the culture of a powerful country.
Haven't we sent our Prince Yun there already?
The fact that Prince Yun is not His Majesty's flesh and blood, has now come to the knowledge of our Emperor and he's really furious about this.
Did you think His Majesty the Emperor wouldn't know that
Prince Yun is not of royal blood, but was instead brought in from outside?
Your Majesty, please think about this carefully.
As far as Your Majesty is concerned, this is a very good opportunity for you.
The prince that we want to send to Tang is not Your Majesty's son, Prince Tae, but royal consort Mok's son, Prince Hyo.
Gim Chun Chu is finally exposing his tail, (showing his true colours) but the Queen didn't take the bait, did she?
That's right, Your Highness.
She's indeed worthy to be Baekje's Queen.
Although she very much hopes that Tae will be installed as the Crown Prince, she hasn't lost her sensibilities and succumbed to temptation.
From now on, make sure that you keep the Queen's movements under close surveillance.
Who she meets up with, and what they're saying, cannot be disregarded.
Report every detail to me.
Yes, I will bear that in mind.
Let's see whether you, Gim Chun Chu, can make your escape safely from Baekje.
The person who catches the biggest animal shall be the winner.
Are you confident?
I've fought with a tiger before.
I will not lose.
Your Majesty should be feeling nervous.
Why are you not getting up on your horse, Your Excellency?
I'm getting old and I have no confidence in my hunting skills.
I can't go so I hope someone else can replace me.
So, who is Tang sending as a replacement?
You cannot dampen the spirits of others, so you must send a highly skilled person.
General.
Please save me from embarrassment.
What do you think?
I shouldn't get involved.
Aren't we marking the alliance between Baekje and Silla?
If General Gye Baek were to join us, it'll be more meaningful.
Get on your horse.
All of you remain here.
With Gye Baek's presence there's nothing to fear.
Yes.
Why is it there's not a single animal around?
If this continues, we won't even be able to bring a rabbit home.
Among the three of us, there must be at least one who'll be able to catch something.
The animals have vanished.
Seems like tigers and wolves must have passed this way.
Let's move somewhere else.
Don't move, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Today is a good opportunity for us to strengthen our friendship.
Today's hunt was very meaningful.
Come, let's drink.
I heard you caught the biggest animal, General.
I want to grow up to be like you, General.
Prince.
I'm honoured, but you must grow up to be like His Majesty, a great monarch.
I've heard about the story of General Mu Jin from teacher, and I'm extremely touched by it.
Teacher,
I want to learn fencing from the General.
The former king was very skillful in fencing too, wasn't he?
I want to be an emperor like that too.
Really...
The prince likes to listen to stories about the General.
Seems like a great Baekje hero is about to rise.
But stories about the General are still the most meaningful.
General Gye Baek is still Baekje's greatest hero.
Your Majesty.
I'm fine.
It's probably because I've had too much to drink, please don't worry, everyone.
Continue drinking.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
General Gye Baek is still Baekje's greatest hero.
Your Majesty.
Naesin jwapyeong is here.
Come in quickly.
Your Majesty.
Are you looking for me?
Come quickly,
Naesin jwapyeong.
You want to send Prince Hyo to Tang?
Why are you saying such a thing?
This is just like sending a Baekje prince to be held hostage.
Tang will persist with their request for us to send our princes there.
We'll definitely have to send one.
I don't know what scheme Gim Chun Chu and Lord Jang Son are planning, but I'll go and see them.
Don't worry.
We don't have to send anyone.
No,
Naesin jwapyeong, didn't we say that we want to ensure Prince Tae be installed as the Crown Prince?
This is our opportunity, to ensure he's installed as the Crown Prince.
Your Majesty, calm down.
Why are you feeling so uneasy?
Do you really not know the reason?
Tae's words have made His Majesty very angry.
Your Majesty.
Prince Tae is still young.
This isn't the fault of the prince, the fault lies with me.
I should have told him.
Yes, that's right.
It was you who allowed our Tae to come to this point.
What kind of person is His Majesty, that a few words about General Gye Baek can cause him to react in such a sensitive manner.
But in that place, my Tae...
Your Majesty.
So please protect our Tae.
You must bear full responsibility.
I didn't expect you to come looking for me naesin jwapyeong.
I didn't come because I wanted to.
I just want to cooperate with you temporarily for Prince Tae's sake.
No matter what you say, we're both in the same boat.
Yes.
But nobody knows how long this partnership will continue.
What you are saying now is true?
Yes.
I heard clearly what the Queen told naesin jwapyeong.
After coming from the Queen's chambers, naesin jwapyeong went straight to meet Gim Chun Chu.
You can leave now.
Yes.
They want to send our Hyo to Tang.
That will never happen.
Your Highness, the situation has now turned to this.
How about we tell His Majesty the whole story?
If we tell His Majesty, then shall we send Tae instead?
Yes.
We can't.
Can my hatred be resolved that easily?
That won't work.
Then...
Is there any other way?
They've taken the bait, we must show them some colour.
Gye Baek, Gye Baek.
Gye Baek.
Even my child admires Gye Baek now!
Your Majesty, please calm down.
Calm down, calm down?
You have to tell Gye Baek.
I, I...
I no longer seem to be a part of this country.
It looks like, it looks like...
This is my father's curse.
Asking me to kill Gye Baek, that was my father's curse.
Your Majesty .
Your Majesty .
The one who deserves to be killed is not Gye Baek.
It's Gim Chun Chu.
Your Majesty, this is all Gim Chun Chu's evil scheme.
Gim Chun Chu is trying to drive a wedge between Your Majesty and Gye Baek, and to bring chaos to Baekje.
Are you here to protect Gye Baek?
No, I'm not.
Does Your Majesty really want to send Hyo to Tang?
To send our Hyo to Tang?
What are you talking about?
Do you know what was discussed between Gim Chun Chu and the Queen when they met?
Gim Chun Chu met the Queen?
Gim Chun Chu, the Queen and also naesin jwapyeong had a meeting.
They said they want to send our Hyo to Tang as a hostage.
What are you talking about right now?
Did you hear correctly?
Why don't you ask the Queen yourself?
Gim Chun Chu plans not only to create a rift between Your Majesty and Gye Baek, but also to take away our Prince as well.
We can't allow Gim Chun Chu to leave Baekje.
Gim Chun Chu.
Is this the reason why you're doing this?
Punish them.
This is our chance to restrain Silla.
Our troops will definitely be able to bring down Silla.
Are you talking about Gye Baek?
All of Baekje belongs to Your Majesty.
Your Majesty must be feeling uneasy.
A dispute should have arisen in the royal court by now.
You're really courageous, igniting trouble in Baekje's territory.
What's the matter?
It's the king's orders.
Arrest Envoy Gim Chun Chu now!
Don't let him come in contact with anyone.
Arrest him!
Yes!
What crime has he committed?
Gim Chu Chu is here as Tang's envoy.
Take him and go!
Chun Chu!
Chun Chu!
Let go of me!
You!
What have I done that you're treating me like this?
Let me see His Majesty.
His Majesty!
Lock the door and keep a close watch on him.
Yes!
Your Majesty .
Lord Jang Son is seeking an audience.
Tell him I won't see him.
You can't see him now.
He said to come back later.
Move aside!
Your Majesty.
If anything happens to Gim Chun Chu,
Tang will not just sit idly by and do nothing.
So?
Are you going to attack us?
Come if you have the might.
Give it some thought.
No matter how much territory you managed to annex, if we don't lay down the law, we can't build the country that we've envisaged.
In that case, the support of the monarch is most important, but now we can't expect anything from His Majesty.
Therefore shouldn't we then look towards the next monarch to do the things we want?
Isn't it too early to talk about the next generation?
I am afraid that hyeongnim will come to harm because of this matter.
Gye Baek.
Do you think I'm saying this because I'm worried about His Majesty?
Eun Go Agassi,
I am talking about her.
Hyeongnim.
You understand her better than anyone.
If we miss this opportunity, we'll once again go through the saga of Queen Sa Taek and Prince Gyo Gi.
Gye Baek.
You are the pillar of Baekje.
I will prepare everything.
All you need is just to support Prince Tae.
Please believe and follow me.
We have a crisis.
His Majesty has imprisoned Gim Chun Chu.
Imprisoned Gim Chun Chu?
What is this all about?
It's interference with internal politics.
It's said that Gim Chun Chu had discussed the installation of the Crown Prince in his meeting with the Queen.
Did Gim Chun Chu bring up the subject of sending Hyo to Tang?
Your Majesty.
If Hyo were to stay in Tang, then obviously Tae will be the Crown Prince.
And you, my Queen, will become the Dowager Empress.
Your Majesty, that's not it.
Gim Chun Chu was praising Tae.
I was just...
Is Gim Chun Chu the King of Baekje?
How dare a subject of Silla discuss the installation of Baekje's Crown Prince.
And also...
Shouldn't the Queen of Baekje drive him away?
I was wrong, Your Majesty.
Please forgive me.
Your Majesty, General Gye Baek, naedu jwapyeong and naesin jwapyeong seek an audience with you.
Come in.
Your Majesty.
Her Majesty was urged on by Gim Chun Chu.
Yes, it's Gim Chun Chu's treacherous scheme.
If we were to punish the Queen, that means his scheme has succeeded.
You, Heung Su!
Putting aside the Queen, even an intelligent person like you got yourself involved.
Can you still hold your head up and call yourself a jwapyeong of this country?
I will interrogate you on your crime.
Just you wait.
How do you intend to deal with Gim Chun Chu, Your Majesty?
I will kill him.
Your Majesty, this will complicate things even further.
We have uncovered Gim Chun Chu's scheme.
-=A dagger hidden in smiles: friendly manners belying hypocritical intentions.=- Your Majesty is well aware that our relationship with Silla is like a dagger hidden in smiles.
I know.
But now is still not the right time.
Even though it can be said that Silla's defense has been weakened by us capturing their city, if they were to put their lives on the line and fight to the death, we may not necessarily win.
We have Gye Baek.
What do you think?
Let's decimate Silla this time.
Your Majesty, on the war front, our question is not just facing Silla.
We have to take into account Goguryeo and Tang.
Tang will most likely send in their reinforcements.
Goguryeo may advance southwards as well.
Do you think Tang will cross the ocean?
As for Goguryeo, all we have to do is to form an alliance with them, as you said earlier.
As for Tang, we can't be sure whether they will come.
As for Goguryeo, we shouldn't underestimate them.
Even if we join forces with them, if an opportunity arises, they will still attack us.
Ask Ui Jik and Seong Chung to take care of Tang and Goguryeo.
You just concentrate on attacking Silla.
You don't have confidence?
It's not that I don't have confidence, but we need more time.
If I were to attack Danghang City this time, then Silla's strength will be greatly weakened.
Let's talk further after the battle.
You were the one who said we must attack Silla.
I am just fulfilling your wish.
Why are you suddenly afraid when we are ready to attack.
Attacking Danghang City and attacking Silla is not just a question of military tactics.
The country's diplomatic and financial policies will have to be redrafted and reframed.
Its better for us to release Gim Chun Chu first before we start our attack on Danghang City.
An all out assault will be dangerous.
I don't need you to attack Danghang City, I can do it myself.
Then...
If we capture Danghang City, can we release Gim Chun Chu?
We must kill him.
We can't let someone deliberately cause chaos in our country by interfering with the bestowment of the Crown Prince.
You shouldn't do that, please withdraw your edict.
Your Majesty.
You can't do it.
It's not me, looks like you're the King.
Your Majesty, please calm down.
This is a matter of grave importance, and affects our country's destiny.
Your servant reckons there's only one way to go about it.
Hold a decision-making meeting to decide on this important matter.
Decision-making meeting?
If we're going to have an all out war with Silla, we'll definitely need the help of the private soldiers kept by the aristocracy.
If we want to mobilize these private soldiers, we'll need to have a decision-making meeting first.
It must be passed at a decision-making meeting.
Please do so, Your Majesty.
Please do as naesin jwapyeong has suggested.
Anyway, sooner or later this has to go through a decision-making meeting.
We might as well take advantage of this opportunity, and turn the private soldiers belonging to the aristocrats, into Your Majesty's soldiers.
It's like killing two birds with one stone.
But if a decision is made to spare Gim Chun Chu's life, what shall we do then?
That will not happen.
I will persuade and convince the nobles.
Are you confident?
Please believe in me.
Then, you must first convince Gye Baek.
Can you do that?
I'll try my best.
Your Majesty, please forgive me.
Your Majesty, please forgive Mother.
Instead,I will accept the punishment on her behalf.
Leave.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, please forgive Her Majesty.
All this has been caused by Gim Chun Chu and his treacherous scheme.
If Your Majesty were to abandon the Queen, that means you have acted in accordance with what Gim Chun Chu wanted.
Please think carefully.
For the sake of the late daejwapyeong,
I will forgive you this once.
I will not forgive if this happens again.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty's grace is boundless.
Your grace is boundless, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
You must conduct yourself with dignity.
Your Highness.
Why are you looking for me?
Your servant cannot comply with what His Majesty has planned.
Pathetic person.
That you're so indifferent to me, feels even more strange.
Be comfortable.
I miss you too, and further, you're allowed to think about it.
What do you mean by that?
General.
On this occasion, you must abide by His Majesty's words without question.
I'll telling you this because I'm worried about you.
What's so important about what I think?
His Majesty is the King of Baekje.
He worries about Baekje more than anybody else.
He wants to kill Gim Chun Chu because of Baekje.
That person will one day become the scourge of Baekje.
That may be so.
But, if we kill Gim Chun Chu, we'll have to start an all out war with Silla.
Even if we do win,
Baekje will also suffer immense losses.
It's unlike you to say such feeble words.
How can there be success without bloodshed?
Are you really the person who hasn't suffered a defeat even once, and who is highly respected by all?
Silla has the backing of Tang.
Tang will not interfere in something out of its authority.
We can't be sure of that.
General, how can you not know?
All these represent your opportunities?
Our soldiers high spirits and morale, is because of you.
The reason for Gim Chun Chu's underhanded scheme, was because of his fear of you.
If you were to take up this matter and appear, this may cripple Silla.
Your Highness, I'm begging you.
Presently, we can't afford to have an all out war with Silla.
We are not ready for that.
For Baekje's sake, please convince His Majesty.
Gye Baek has rejected it?
He said it's too early for us to have an all out war with Silla, and rejected her Highness' proposal adamantly.
He further told Her Highness to convince Your Majesty.
I know, you can leave now.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I told her to persuade Gye Baek, but instead she's now supposed to convince me.
If Eun Go abides by Gye Baek's words, what will happen?
For Baekje's sake, please convince His Majesty.
Are you looking for me?
Welcome, there's something I need you to do for me, Sinyeo.
Tell me.
You once said that we must kill Gim Chun Chu.
Do you still think that is so?
Your Highness, Gim Chun Chu is a danger to Baekje.
He must be killed immediately.
No matter what sacrifices we have to make?
Killing Gim Chun Chu, what's the value of that?
But, then why do people object to His Majesty's idea?
Of course we must have people who'll object.
What?
If we have a wise monarch, then we must have a forthright minister.
-=Wise monarch, forthright minister:
A virtuous monarch needs a forthright minister to advise him.=- If we have a wise monarch, then we must have a forthright minister.
If there's no one to oppose His Majesty's ideas, there'll be no stars in Baekje anymore.
If that happens, that would be most fearful.
Don't let that happen.
Go and prevent it.
That's something Your Highness will have to do for Baekje's sake.
Gim Chun Chu is so daring as to provoke disorder in the royal family of Baekje.
I must sentence him to death.
What?
Death penalty?
What are you going to do?
Your Majesty, if we kill Gim Chun Chu, that's tantamount to starting an all out war with Silla.
I already know that, this concerns our country's destiny.
Since I can't make this decision unilaterally, we're having a meeting so that a vote can be taken.
Daejwapyeong, call for a meeting to decide on this issue as soon as possible.
Yes, Your Majesty.
He wants to kill him.
Will we be going to war with Silla?
General.
My Lord, Daejwapyeong.
Did you know of this beforehand?
Yes.
His Majesty discussed this with you earlier?
I'm also very curious about your views on this.
I'll come and look for you, General, as soon as possible.
In order to prevent us going to war, we must convince the nobles.
We must definitely do that.
Deok sol, you must use all your means to monitor the movement of the nobility.
Yes, Your Majesty.
The most important person to watch is Gye Baek.
Everybody will want to consult him on his views.
Whoever comes into contact with Gye Baek, don't leave even one person out of your secret report.
Your servant will obey Your Majesty's decree.
A Silla subject is so daring as to interfere in our royal succession.
But we can't kill Gim Chu Chu just like that.
Doesn't he have the backing of Tang behind him?
But don't you think Gim Chun Chu has overstepped the mark?
Tang will definitely step in and intervene.
We shouldn't get agitated.
We need to judge this with composure.
The Council's decision today may decide the future of Baekje.
Can we have your views, General?
As the person who's guarding our borders,
I'm opposed to starting an all out war against Silla.
Now is not the time to do so.
Do you want to spare Gim Chun Chu his life?
We'll have to kill Gim Chun Chu sooner or later.
But not now.
Furthermore, killing Gim Chun Chu, should be done on the battlefield.
This is the list of nobles who are agreeable to spare Gim Chun Chu.
Therefore deploying those people whose names are on this list will be sufficient.
Should I set up a meeting for you?
That's not feasible.
It's too difficult to break through the enemies who are united.
Then...
Yes, the time you've spent gathering all that information concerning the nobles, will be of great assistance.
I know it's important for you to preserve your neutral stand on this matter, Daejywapyeong, but, not showing your stand on a matter when it concerns our country's destiny, this could very well be despicable.
Your Excellency, Daejwapyeong.
Tang has, without reasonable cause, been bullying Baekje for a long time.
You must be angry.
If we attack Silla, we'll have to cut all diplomatic ties with Tang.
In that case, Baekje will be isolated.
We should then just strengthen our ties with the pirates instead?
Furthermore, don't you owe me a debt, daejwapyeong?
The matter of the Sa Taek clan.
You're not happy.
If you're not happy, you just have to cast it aside.
Don't you agree, Daejwapyeong?
You want me to list Gim Chun Chu's sins to convince the nobles?
That's correct.
Your servant is sorry, Your Highness.
I will pretend I didn't hear that.
I, as a Jojeong Jwapyeong of this country, have an obligation to remain neutral.
If you abide by my request,
I won't forget your deed, jwapyeong.
Your Highness, I have never been driven by any private interest to waver.
Is that so?
This...
Isn't it a letter that you wrote to the University in order for your son to complete his studies, and helped him become the secretary of internal affairs?
Your Highness!
Deok Sol.
Yes, Your Highness.
Burn that letter quickly.
Yes.
Jojeong jwapyeong is a talented man in our royal court.
I believe jojeong jwapyeong will stand on His Majesty's side and perform great deeds.
The number of noblemen advocating Gim Chun Chun be killed is increasing.
Her Highness, the royal consort, summoned them personally and convinced them.
She has grasped hold of their weaknesses.
A crisis will arise.
I was about to go and seek Your Highness out.
General, there are times where you would actually seek me out?
That the path Your Highness is taking, is for the sake of Baekje.
Have you ascertained that?
Of course.
Do you really want to throw this country into danger?
Shut up.
No matter how great a hero you are to Baekje, how could you say such a thing?
Leave.
Gye Baek.
Do you know why I have to do this?
If you were to be the vanguard and attack Silla, you will gain greater eminence than His Majesty.
Compared to His Majesty, the commoners will hold you in higher regard.
And finally,
His Majesty will fear you.
That matter, is your revenge against His Majesty for snatching me away.
Your Highness!
Only then...
Only then I, Eun Go, can return to your side.
-= Next Episode Preview =-
How is it that people can be so cruel?
It would have been better if I hadn't known.
I hate everything.
I don't know how to handle the General.
I really, really hate His Majesty.
I cannot forgive you.
We can't return to the past.
Compared to the past, the future is more important.
We must ensure Prince Hyo is installed as the Crown Prince.
Hasn't the Queen already made her moves?
This will be another war.
-= Episode 19 =-
His Highness the Crown Prince has arrived.
The future of Baekje now rests on your shoulders.
Learn more, do more good deeds and become a wise king.
I will remember it well, Your Majesty.
Give the Crown Prince his official bestowment edict and official gown.
Yes, Your Majesty.
On the occasion of His Highness' investiture ceremony as Crown Prince, we pray that Your Majesty and the Crown Prince will be flooded with blessings.
Long live Your Majesty!
Long live Your Majesty!
Long live Your Majesty!
Congratulations to you.
We've been awaiting your arrival, Your Highness.
It's Your Highness Crown Prince.
I'm sorry, Your Highness Crown Prince.
Take a seat.
To be addressed differently is just not me.
All of you will also be addressed differently.
Do you mean to say we'll be given official ranks?
I'm curious.
What positions do you plan to give us,
Your Highness?
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Deok Sol, Seong Chung.
Civil Service Department, Deok Sol, Heung Su.
Royal Guards Division, Deok Sol, Gye Baek.
I will ask His Majesty for his consent to the appointments.
-= Deok Sol: 4th grade, out of a total of 16 ranks = = Deok Sol: 4th grade, out of a total of 16 ranks =- A minion has now become a Deok Sol, such a vast change.
You said it before, didn't you?
If we were appointed Deok Sol, we'll be able to start a family.
I can stop being a bachelor.
Right, if she married you based on your official rank, she's definitely not a decent woman.
Then, you can choose one for me.
The Deok Sol in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs shall be in charge of all the personnel.
It's an important position.
Also, the Deok Sol of the Civil Service Department shall be in charge of all military positions.
It's not an official rank that allows you much free time to think about marriage.
So do you mean I should die of old age and still remain an old virgin?
That is also possible!
In short, the things that we have to do are many.
That's really...
So do you want us to accept or not?
This is too...
It's definitely not because of their heroic achievements, but later on, they can lead those Baekje subjects who are of good calibre, that's why I'm recommending them.
The one who's called Heung Su, I met him before at the Choheongwan ceremony.
As for Seong Chung, he achieved meritorious deeds in our siege of Gajamseong City.
Gye Baek...
To inherit Mu Jin's former position is a given.
Crown Prince.
Yes, Your Majesty.
What do you think of the person called Eun Go who was collaborating with you?
Whether to let her return to her guild or give her the position of an official, I'm still considering.
That's not what I meant.
Do you have any other feelings towards her?
Tell me your real feelings.
We're just comrades who suffered together, there's no other feelings.
Now you're the Crown Prince of Baekje, for the future of this country, it's your right to have concubines and install them in the inner palace.
To have children, isn't that the reason for a king to do so?
I will remember your words.
Your Majesty, the Crown Princess is seeking an audience.
Send her in.
Come over quickly.
Let me take a look at my grandchild.
Child, you seem to have grown.
You're here.
I heard after your investiture, you had been working through the night in your office.
That's harmful to your body.
You should come and rest in my residence, and also come and see the child.
I'm sorry, there's just so much to do.
I probably won't be able to go over at the moment.
Is that so?
Is there anything I can help you with?
I'll get some tonic and bring it to you.
It's all right, don't worry about it.
Pay more attention to the child.
Your Majesty, I will excuse myself.
Mother.
Where did you go that you're only coming home now?
Mother, I'm very hungry.
I just knew you'd be here.
You're cleaning up here all by yourself, and you didn't ask anybody for help?
I'm fine.
It's also possible that I'm trying to feel my parents' presence.
What if you were to get injured?
Let me do it.
You should rest.
I'm fine.
In our line of work, if there's no one available, I help out by carrying things.
These are nothing much.
All right, I know, then let's do it together.
Are you all right?
Give it to me.
Did you cook this yourself?
I didn't do a good job.
I don't know whether it's to your taste or not.
What is it?
Isn't it cooked or...
It's really delicious.
You're teasing me.
Thank you.
You're the first person since the death of my mother who's cooked for me.
Whenever you want to eat, just tell me.
I can cook it for you again.
You must be hungry, hurry up and eat.
I never, ever thanked my mother, who cooked for me everyday.
When my parents and Mun Geun hyeong were around, (Hyeong - older brother)
I never knew before how happy we were.
In the future, you'll find your happiness again.
Don't you have me?
What is this, I put a lot of effort into cooking this meal.
You're not even putting up a pretence that it's delicious.
Yes, I will enjoy this meal.
Someone from the guild is here, agassi.
(Agassi - young lady)
Go and take a quick look.
Who are you?
Are you Eun Go?
Who are you, isn't this our first meeting?
I am Mok Han Deok,
Your father's younger brother, Mok Han Deok, also your uncle.
It's you who restored our Mok family.
Thanks to you we are allowed to return to Sabi City.
You have done a good job.
Your late father would be very happy.
All along I thought I was the only one alive.
I'm so happy to see you so healthy.
In the future all the descendants of the Mok family who have gone into hiding will return to Sabi City.
Yes, Uncle.
They should all come here.
Our Mok family members, although innocent, had to hide.
I will compensate them for all their grievances.
So, in the future, we'll look to you to lead our family.
We must definitely rebuild this family.
I'm so happy to know that Eun Go still has family members.
She was worried that, after Madam who was like a mother to her left, there would be nobody to manage the business.
That's really fortunate.
Yes.
Even though it hasn't been a long time, she's gone through more suffering than anyone else.
Now is the time to compensate her.
Madam, bring some cups here.
How's the enquiry among the people going?
What about you all?
We went to the outlying areas around Sabi City.
They feel both hopeful and worried about the new dynasty.
What about the City itself?
There's not many changes either.
All of you must be feeling good.
To have a person who's a half blooded Silla as Crown Prince.
How can all of you still be in the mood to drink?
Madam said it well!
Where Ui Ja is concerned, the Silla Queen is his maternal aunt.
It's also possible that he'll be calling "Aunt, aunt" in that way.
How can he do that?
Even though it grates on the ear, they're still your subjects.
Even though the Sa Taek family has disappeared, what difference does it make to us?
Just you wait and see, they'll be fighting among themselves clamouring for the highest position!
That's really...
The moon is like that, the Crown Prince is the same, just half.
The moon is also a half moon.
Don't say that.
No matter whether it's a half-moon or full moon, the light it emits is just as bright.
Your Highness will definitely be an enlightened ruler who'll illuminate Baekje.
Yes, yes.
Why do you look so terrible?
I thought by getting rid of the Sa Taek family, the people would be happy.
What changes have the people experienced?
It's not easy for them to have two meals a day.
We must do more things and let the people know that the manners and the morals of the times have changed.
Let Gye Baek be the commander of Geukryeol City.
Isn't he the Deok Sol of the royal guards?
Geukryeol City is often attacked by Silla.
Within the space of a year, two generals have died.
People are living in fear.
The noblemen want to retreat, we must protect them.
I know that too, but it's just too far and too arduous.
Can't we just let him remain in Sabi City?
I will just ask you one question.
Go ahead and ask.
Although Mu Jin offered himself voluntarily, you stabbed Mu Jin right before his eyes, and I allowed that to happen.
Do you really think Gye Baek has forgotten about it?
My heart is still uneasy about this.
Gye Baek and I are sworn brothers.
If he hadn't forgotten, how could he have agreed?
You don't have to be suspicious of him anymore.
A person's heart is difficult to predict.
The day when they are dissatisfied with you, the memory will come back.
That definitely will not happen.
Are you really sure?
I'm begging you again, please retract your edict.
- Gye Baek, he...
- You, are really intending to keep him by your side, aren't you?
You killed him!
Furthermore, Mu Jin's son witnessed it.
Gye Baek...
Do you really want to keep him beside you?
You really want to keep him by your side, don't you?
Your Highness, Gye Baek is here.
Are you looking for me?
Have a seat.
I must first apologize to you.
Uncle.
Uncle, you've been summoned to the Palace.
What do you mean I've been summoned to the Palace?
Looks like the assistance I can give His Highness is limited.
His Highness needs another person by his side to strike a balance.
What can I say that is of help?
You shouldn't say that, you've acquired vast experience and knowledge from your travels.
That will definitely be of help.
When you're by His Highness' side, tell him what is right and what is wrong.
You don't have to praise me like that.
Are you saying you don't have an official position, so you're recommending me to replace you and convey your messages to him?
Agassi!
Aigoo, who's this?
(Aigoo - oh dear, oh my god)
Should I call you Your Excellency Deok Sol?
Come in quickly, Royal Guards Deok Seol, sir.
Now that you're no longer on the fringe, where's your residence?
I don't need a residence.
So you're going to be the commander of Geukryeol City?
Yes.
The outermost borders.
Furthermore, there are frequent attacks by the Silla army.
His Majesty has gone too far.
No, that's not it.
I, who's so incapable,
I'll go anywhere I'm needed.
Looks like I'll have to have a word with the Crown Prince.
He has already pleaded many times, and he has also apologized profusely.
I'm really fine with it.
Moreover Sabi city is too boring, I'm feeling so frustrated.
So, when will you be back?
I'm not certain, I can only make a decision after taking a look at the situation over there.
Agassi.
Aren't you coming with me?
For a long time, I have been dreaming of a moment like this.
Holding this perfume sachet that you gave me, agassi, enduring day after day.
Waiting for the arrival of this day.
I hope that you can leave with me, agassi.
I hope you can accompany me there, agassi.
Then, I shall wait for your answer tomorrow.
Eun Go.
What are you thinking about?
I'm sorry.
You're here, Your Highness.
His Majesty has appointed you as the Minister of Urban History.
Minister of Urban History?
This official position is too important for me.
His Majesty has decided.
In fact, the heroic person who first brought down the Sa Taek family, isn't it you?
Although you're a woman, you're braver and wiser than any man.
-= Jang Sa: the highest serving officer in a department =-
Stay by my side and assist me.
-= Jang Sa: the highest serving officer in a department =-
Could it be that...
Gye Baek came?
Yes.
He told you he's going to Geukryeol City?
Yes.
He wants you to go with him?
Yes.
Will you go?
I've not decided.
Eun Go.
Even if Gye Baek has to leave, why don't you stay behind?
If Gye Baek leaves, and if you were to leave also, I don't think I can hold up and carry on.
But, Your Highness.
For the sake of living on, I've been suffering all this while.
You and I.
Maybe I'll meet with more difficulties in the future.
Gye Baek will come home after he has accomplished his task.
There are many matters here that require your presence.
For my sake, and also for Baekje's sake...
The Crown Princess is here.
Crown Princess, you're here.
His Highness, is he working?
He has gone out.
Where did he go?
I don't know.
You, who's by His Highness' side all the time, how can you not know where he went?
You're not telling me!
I really don't know.
He only said he's going out of the Palace for a while.
It's because Geukryeol City is near to Silla, that's why it'd suffered frequent attacks.
Within the space of a year, many people have died.
The morale of the soldiers is very low.
You'll have to make them go through rigorous training.
Otherwise, Silla will launch an immediate attack.
Don't worry.
I won't disappoint all my hyeongnims.
(Hyeongnim - respected older brother)
But, today you're acting a bit strange.
Why are you in such a good mood?
If it was me, I'd have been very angry to be given such a task.
Is the blood of a loyal officer the same as your blood?
What?
Won't you be lonely if you're going alone?
How about taking someone along?
It's not necessary.
There's someone who'll be going with me.
Who is it?
Why is it when we ask you who, you keep laughing like an idiot?
You're not...
I have to make preparations, I'll leave first.
Eun Go, agassi?
Are you still awake?
If you can't sleep, how about having a drink with me?
Fine.
Why are you so distressed?
Where in the world can you find someone as happy as you, agassi?
You've taken your revenge, you've money and... and a good man who likes you.
What worries do you have?
Unlike me who's so pitiful.
Cho Yeong, if you were allowed to choose between your country and your feelings, which would you choose?
Country or feelings?
Is it an official post?
I would choose both.
Why should I choose one?
But someone like me will not be able to attain an official post.
I would choose feelings then.
Really?
Yes.
He's handsome, and has the aura of a real man.
Accept it.
If you want to rebuild your home, don't you need money?
So much money.
The Sa Taek family took responsibility and left.
Now what's left is just you and me.
Have a good talk with your niece about our matter.
I will obey everything she says.
Your niece is one of those trusted by the Crown Prince.
This will be very helpful.
Yes, I understand.
I'll have a good talk with her.
Why have you come so suddenly?
Eun Go says the good wine reminds her of you.
Come in, quickly.
Why are they drinking that good wine by themselves?
I want to drink as well.
You must return home safely.
Thank you.
Eun Go has been appointed the Minister of Urban History.
Congratulations to you, agassi.
I don't know whether I can do justice to the post.
You will do a good job, agassi.
Right, she's the equal of a man.
I'm... going out for a while.
Because we have to rebuild the country, there are so many matters that need attention.
Therefore, this time I can't go with you.
That can't be helped.
It'll be fine if I complete the task as soon as possible and come back.
You must do that.
I'll wait for you.
Leave here to us.
Complete your task quickly and come home.
That won't do.
You can't be that anxious.
Every place is Baekje.
Every commoner is Baekje.
You must approach it carefully.
I know that too.
I too want him to proceed carefully, complete it quickly and come home.
I will keep that in mind.
If you should meet with any difficulties, tell me immediately.
Yes, I know.
I'll pray for your safety.
What's written up here?
Aiyo, I can't read.
It says the person who was previously alleged to be a spy, General Mu Jin, and the Imperial College Professor Mok Han Byeok have been vindicated.
Really?
Then who's the person below here?
This is the person who helped in the rebellion.
Is that so?
This is so sudden, what shall we do?
Throwaway, where can we go?
I want to go back.
To turn some other place into my kingdom.
Must you go to Tang?
I don't want to stay here, and revenge is now impossible.
Furthermore, I no longer have Gyo Gi's assistance.
I have no reason to continue staying here.
We want to follow you, leader.
I am now a wanted man.
It'll be very difficult for me to take all of you with me.
I will go by myself.
You all look out for yourselves.
What are you doing?
Is this our first meeting that you had to ask?
You and I are partners, you can't just leave by yourself.
So, we'll go together with you.
Move aside.
I heard,
Mu Jin has been vindicated.
You should go and tell them you're Mu Jin's son.
Don't you think it's possible to go to Prince Ui Ja and ask for the post of an official?
Do you want to die?
The person who caused my mother's death was Mu Jin.
Don't take it out, anyway you'll have to keep it in.
Keep it in.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I forgot about that.
I'm sorry.
In fact Mu Jin and I were enemies too.
You know that too, right?
Because Mu Jin wanted to infiltrate the Wi Je faction, he deceived me.
That's why I ended up like this.
That's true, hyeongnim should bear with this for a short while.
Right, it's because of this matter that we suffered so much pain.
All right, all right.
Calm down, everybody.
Look around, this side and that as well.
The soldiers have passed.
Do you think they have gone to have their meal?
They're searching for you.
They're searching for you.
You are really...
If one doesn't know, then it's fine.
It will be the same in other places.
So do you think you can slip away so easily?
It's not that simple.
It will be very difficult.
But... even if the sky should fall, there's a place where you can live.
Who am I?
I am Dok Gae.
There's not a single place that I've not been since I was ten years old.
Isn't Tang a place you've never been before?
Turn your head, a little bit more.
Again, a little harder.
That was because a war was going on at that time, that's why I didn't go.
It was so chaotic then, you little brat.
That's why I want to go.
Throwaway, I know of thirty seven thousand ways to make an escape.
You just have to use one.
What is it?
First, let's go down to Silla.
Although we can go from the city, that would be too dangerous.
Therefore,
I know of other places where I still have people I'm acquainted with.
They are nice people.
Let's go there and thereafter take a boat to Tang.
Why do you want to follow me?
Good question.
After having worked with you, one day I developed a sense of obligation.
See, there's Dae Su here, and Yong Su.
Take a good look at them.
You don't have an answer, do you?
It's very depressing, right?
Living with them.
Yesterday, goo was still dripping from his nose, goo.
How can I follow a person like this?
My future is very bleak.
Only by following a person like you, can I have a bright future.
That's my thinking.
You and I.
I'll turn you into the most powerful man.
What if I were to reject your offer?
Don't you want to escape?
Look, chestnut.
When we were going up the hill, didn't we see a chestnut?
Yong Su is still peeling the first one.
So, Throwaway, the road going through Silla is now blocked.
It's better for us to go down further and take a boat from there.
But do we really have to go to Tang?
Can't we just live in Baekje?
Me too, I don't know what Tang is like.
I feel if we go there, we may not be able to adapt.
You fellows.
Language can be expressed through actions.
All languages, can be expressed through actions.
Take a look.
Even in the midst of my meal, you're making me stand up.
Once you see it, you'll know it can be done.
Here.
I'm hungry, please give me some food to eat.
I want to go to the lavatory, where's the lavatory?
You can understand all of it.
There's no necessity for language.
It's so embarrassing.
Then what do you two want to do here?
Do you still want to depend on other people to live?
Since you're men, you should be ambitious.
Can't we start all over from here?
What Yong Su said is correct.
Even though we're not very capable, we're capable of turning a trick or two.
Who knows?
We may be successful.
Such depressing people.
So becoming a coach is considered successful?
These depressing people.
Men must have big ambitions.
Do you all know what's in my head?
I want to follow him to Tang so that I can do big business.
Isn't that so, Throwaway?
Just eat your food.
Yes.
Why are you here?
Because you were the Queen's follower, that's why you were driven out?
You seem very happy about it.
Since you pledged your loyalty to Prince Gyo Gi, why didn't you follow him?
Right, I know you will provoke me.
I'm also in a bad mood.
Let's have a showdown.
Let me ask you a question.
If I were to go from here, will it lead me to Geukryeol City?
Stop talking nonsense, draw your sword.
If you answer me I will do as you say, but I don't have the time to fool around with you.
All of you, aren't you supposed to go into hiding?
Who allowed all of you to harvest?
Sir.
Then, what are we to eat?
Please let us do the harvesting.
This is an order from His Lordship.
Get away quickly!
I can't do that.
I have five family members, they'll soon die of starvation.
Do you want to die?
Stop that!
You look like private security guards.
Whose subordinates are you?
How can you mistreat the people?
Don't interfere.
If you don't want to die then just walk away.
Don't interfere.
If you don't want to die then just walk away.
I must interfere.
You hoodlum!
Why is it the master of these villains hasn't turned up?
Have you told him clearly?
Yes.
Elder.
So, you're the new commander.
Why are you doing this?
You're the person who has been starving the people.
What did you instruct them to do?
Look here, Commander!
That cultivated field belongs to our family, it's up to me whether I want to harvest or not.
Furthermore, Commander, didn't you receive orders to protect the back areas?
What has that got to do with this?
They're people who refused to move to the back areas.
Commander you've actually helped these people who have dared to defy the imperial edict.
Sir, that's not how it is.
We didn't defy the imperial edict.
It's just that we've been farmers for generations.
We just want to protect this place.
And if we were to move to the back wasteland, while waiting for the harvest, we would have died of starvation first.
You saw that?
I too have to give up my land and leave, but these persistent people still insisted on harvesting.
If we were to give them those grains, it will harden their resolve not to leave.
Eventually those lands will become Silla's new territories.
They will also become subjects of Silla.
That's why I want to burn those cultivated fields, so that it will not leave any seeds.
-=The military destroy all their food and equipment so that the enemy can't use them.=- Commander, with your status, you should be aware of the saying, clear the place and leave it wild in a war situation.
These people have been living here for generations.
Whether they become subjects of Baekje or Silla, it doesn't matter to them.
As long as they have food to eat and go on living, it's fine with them.
If we burn the land and the grain, that nobleman, Jin Deok, wouldn't he suffer great loss too?
He's shifted to another place and has received compensation for his cultivated lands.
But only if we can get the villagers to move, can we succeed.
But, why are the soldiers here so undisciplined?
The soldiers completely disregard all military protocol.
They're very inattentive where security is concerned.
I'm very sorry, the sergeant while supposedly guarding the village, abandoned them.
Do you want to try and make them more responsible?
Scoundrel!
What nonsense is that?
Before we move out from here, this is still Baekje's territory.
I will give the orders from now on.
Those who don't obey, inform them they'll be dealt with strictly.
Yes.
Throwaway, what shall we do now?
Something serious has cropped up.
The place where the people whom I used to know were staying, is now occupied by somebody else.
There's a warning that it's part of Silla's expansion plans.
How can such changes happen so suddenly?
What you're saying now is not what you said before!
It does look different.
It turned yellow, yellow.
So all of you are useless to me now.
Throwaway!
Even if it is so, you don't have to be like this.
As you know, I'm not like that.
Out of 37 000 methods, we've only used one.
Don't we still have a lot more left?
What is there to come, what, what else?
Haven't I written it down?
That... plan... that...
Wait a moment, let me think, hold on, I'm thinking.
Let me think, how can I think when you stick a knife in front of me?
Hold on.
Hold on, hold on, I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
What is good?
Thinking.
Wait, I seem to have found a way.
From what I heard from the villagers earlier, they're trying to conceal it from all the people here.
Once we find out the secret information concerning that day, we'll then request for Silla's assistance.
And then we'll be able to cross the border.
That's a very good idea!
Aigoo, those Silla villains will be extremely happy.
I'm going insane because of these children.
These children who've been following me around have really grown up a lot.
So you are all green*.
(*green here is use to indicate youthful.)
but indigo extract is bluer than the plant.
(means the pupil surpasses the teacher)
You're flattering me.
These rascals should by right be making me nervous now.
Look at the two of you.
Throwaway doesn't seem to understand our conversation.
Indigo extract is bluer than the plant.
I can't leave, I might as well die here!
I won't go!
Even if you don't leave they'll still burn it.
Let him kill me then!
As long as we have food to keep us alive, that's enough.
Whether it's Baekje or Silla, how can they?
I'm not leaving!
I won't leave!
What are you saying?
What?
Not moving out of the village?
That's right, we'll defend the village until the end.
So, please give me your soldiers.
Are you trying to defy the imperial edict now?
If I give you my soldiers,
I won't even have doors left!
You have food stored up and can go on living, but the subjects, until they can cultivate the land, will die of hunger.
We can't let them die like that.
Anyway, if they refuse to leave, they will also end up dying in the hands of those cruel Silla villains.
Do as you please.
I will leave here.
Stop!
I'm ordering you in my capacity as commander, to hand over your private soldiers.
You, as the commander, actually dare to defy the imperial edict.
Do you want to kill me, whose ancestors have for generations protected this place?
Gather all the soldiers.
Yes.
Is this the entire army?
Because of the sudden invasion by Silla, they were either killed or had fled.
Thanks to the private soldiers of His Lordship, we were able to defend this village.
My legs!
My legs!
Are you all right?
You should have been more careful considering the weight of the stone.
What's the use of lifting stones everyday?
Anyway, when those Silla villains come attacking, it's like we'll be fighting an open war.
You, who do you think you're attacking?
This person...
How old are you?
Why are you not talking respectfully?
You scoundrel!
Stop it!
Can you scoundrels count as soldiers?
Do I have to kill all of you to establish discipline?
Commander, you don't have to say any more.
What's the use of protecting a place that will soon be abandoned by the private guards?
And what can these soldiers do?
Even if thousands of people were to come, this place will fall to the enemy.
You as a section chief, have never given a single thought to do battle?
How can you talk like that?
Do you all think that I will ask all of you to guard this village with me when I don't have a plan?
The only way for the Silla army to come in here is through this road.
You go and spread the news that we're moving out of this village tomorrow.
Silla will definitely receive that news through her spies.
They will surely come and scout around tonight.
I know.
And bring along ten soldiers and follow me.
Here is fine.
Let's begin our work.
Geukryeol City will retreat to the back area tomorrow?
Yes, that information is accurate.
Are you villains subjects of Baekje?
How can I believe your words?
Maybe you're all pretending to be spies to lure us into a trap.
So why did we come directly to Geukryeol City?
All we have to do is just spread the rumours.
So you're saying, why should you risk your lives and wait here.
So you're asking us to go and confirm it?
Yes, that's what we meant.
What do you want?
Let Silla's warning be heard a little louder.
So you were originally a criminal in Baekje.
No, it's not like that.
We were just merchants.
You may have already heard and know of this.
After Lord Sa Taek was expelled, new people took over,
Because of them, Baekje is now in complete chaos.
We just want to live, that's why we want to settle in Silla.
Good, if you're telling me the truth,
I will help you all to settle in Silla.
Thank you, City Mayor.
Take some soldiers and do some scouting today.
If the moving is a fact, then immediately proceed to launch an all out attack tomorrow.
Make full preparations so that the Baekje villains will not be able to make their escape.
We're already going to annexe the outskirts of Geukryeol City.
Do we still have to go and scout around?
It's just a matter of time before we will annex Geukryeol City too.
It's unnecessary to launch an all out attack.
It's enough just to have these few soldiers scout around.
The problem lies with the city mayor.
Every time he's blocking our nobleman's underlings and his private soldiers.
Isn't he doing that just to show off his powers?
I would love to see the new commander's expression when he's running helter skelter.
Who are you, scoundrel?
The person whom you villains are dying to meet.
The newly appointed commander.
Seize him!
What happened?
It's an ambush, an ambush, retreat!
Shoot.
Attack!
You villains, is your chief guard the younger brother of Gim Yu Sin, Hang Sin?
Yes.
You resemble your brother a lot.
What's your name, villain?
You'll be dead soon, why do you want to know my name?
You asked me for my name?
I am Baekje's Jang su, Gye Baek.
As long as I'm alive, you won't be able to put even one foot on Baekje's land.
Are you saying all our soldiers have been exterminated?
I'm really sorry.
That, what really happened?
What's to be done?
It's a trap.
You villains dare to deceive me.
You were hoping I'd make an all out attack.
Take these villains out now and have them beheaded!
Hold on, I'm sure something went wrong somewhere.
If you don't believe it,
I'll go and behead the Commander and the nobleman by myself.
What happened?
Aren't they Silla soldiers?
Everybody, these are Silla soldiers killed by us.
We can do it.
We can protect this land.
Everybody, you have lived on this land for generations.
You no longer have to leave.
Now all of you don't have to be Silla's subjects.
I, Gye Baek, and the Baekje army, won't let them touch even one of your fingers.
We won't let them put even one foot on your lands.

-= Next Episode Preview =-
What are you doing?
If they have to leave the grain behind, they will die of starvation!
You are defying the imperial edict.
I won't sit idly by.
If we were to start an attack, to fall under the enemy's occupation is just a matter of time.
Your Highness, go in and rest for a while.
What are you doing here?
Who are you?
Who really sent you?
Shut up, just kill me immediately!
It's fine to eat chicken.
Is your father still alive?
Welcome, Your Highness Crown Prince.
I am Gim Chun Chu.
Because you defied the imperial edict, you are relieved from your post.
Because of one corrupt nobleman, the villagers will lose their lives.
Your Highness, I've decided to leave Sabi City.
Are you here to say your goodbyes?
It's not necessary.
I don't want to say goodbye to you.
I'm not here to say goodbye, but I came because I wanted to entrust you with something.
Please, assist His Majesty in his duties.
And please, return to the wise Eun Go agassi of before.
(Agassi - young lady)
Please promise me you'll agree to my request.
-= Episode 31 =-
You've worked hard.
In future don't let any misfortune befall the palace.
Protect it well.
Yes, Great General.
Your Highness.
What is the matter?
His Majesty has arrived, he has been waiting for quite a while.
Your Majesty, why are you not at your residence, but instead you've come here?
Did I come to a place I shouldn't have?
That is not what I meant.
Have you met Gye Baek?
He came to tell me he's leaving Sabi City, and to say goodbye.
Did he say anything else?
That's all he said.
Gye Baek has, as you said, yielded the position of the Great General.
He requested that I send him to the border.
Then do as he requested.
If Gye Baek goes back on the battlefield, he'll once again be the hero.
The same thing will repeat itself.
Your Majesty, what do you intend to do with General Gye Baek?
Once this matter is settled, we'll hold the Queen's installation ceremony immediately.
You'll be the queen of this country.
Your Majesty,
Therefore, until the installation ceremony is over, just do as I say.
Do you understand?
In other words, what I mean is, don't do anything.
Your Majesty,
Your servant Gye Baek wants to resign from the post of Great General.
I've never consented to you resigning from your post of Great General, so what is your reason for resigning?
Your servant agreed to serve in that position under extraordinary circumstances, but now that Your Majesty has recovered, it's no longer necessary for me to shoulder this responsibility.
Your servant Gye Baek, as military personnel should now return to the battlefield.
I request for your permission.
In view of your reasons, I'm helpless to say otherwise.
But, the Great General who has defended the capital city and participated in national policies, his sudden resignation may, I fear, have a great impact on national policies.
This is worrying me, so I wish to reinstate naedu jwapyeong Heung Su.
Does any of my loyal subjects have other opinions?
Your Majesty,
Naedu jwapyeong is an indispensable court official.
I've been waiting for Your Majesty's boundless grace, I'm extremely grateful.
We are humbled by Your Majesty's grace.
Internal affairs Deok Sol, come forward.
Go and inform naedu jwapyeong about his reinstatement.
Yes, Your Majesty.
And Deok Sol Gye Baek,
-= Goseoiwan City: presently South Jeolla Province, Haenam County. =- In recognition of your previous contributions, I'm naming you the city lord of Goseoiwan City.
-= Goseoiwan City: presently South Jeolla Province, Haenam County. =- I want to give you, the battle-weary General Gye Baek, a chance to rest.
Your Majesty,
Right now, Silla is watching us like a tiger watches its prey.
We have to send General Gye Baek to the frontier bordering Silla.
Is Gye Baek the only military leader in this country?
Why must we burden Gye Baek alone with such a huge responsibility?
Why doesn't anyone else want to go and perform some meritorious service, instead of wanting to hide behind Gye Baek?
Your Majesty, that is not what I meant.
I've not finished yet.
Think about the time when I was leading an expedition to Daeha City.
Who was the one who achieved great merit then?
It was the recently reinstated naedu jwapyeong Heung Su, and also Generals Ui Jik and Eun Sang.
Weren't they the ones who got the city lord to surrender, and captured the city?
As everyone was united, even the hard to capture Daeha City also fell into our hands.
But why must we always rely on Gye Baek, and never give him time to rest?
Your Majesty,
What's your opinion, Gye Baek?
I want to reward you for your previous contributions.
It's not bad to take this opportunity to live a peaceful life in a quiet place, is it?
Aren't you going to accept my personal reward to you?
Your servant Gye Baek, accepts the royal edict.
Why didn't you heed my advice and meet the king on your own?
I don't know whether you're satisfied or not, hyeongnim, (Hyeongnim - respected older brother) but I reckon this isn't bad.
But, I never expected to be sent to Goseoiwan.
His Majesty is worried you'll be a hero again, that's why he's sending you there.
You know the reason too.
Who gave you permission to get me reinstated?
How many times have I told you I don't want that power?
Hyeongnim, I'm satisfied that you were reinstated.
What do you really intend to do?
Are you really going to Goseoiwan?
No, you can't.
Absolutely not!
I must seek an audience with His Majesty.
Hyeongnim, you've just been reinstated.
You mustn't be driven out again.
Please conduct yourself with dignity.
How can I send you there?
How can I be at ease?
One.
Two.
How long has it been?
This body, that has been itching all this time, can now return to the battlefield.
That goes without saying.
We haven't been fighting in a long time.
This time it's not just 40 Silla cities, we'll step on Silla's territory and raise our Baekje flag.
Are you that happy?
Then aren't you happy, Cho Yeong?
I am also happy!
That was a piece of good news.
We're moving to Goseoiwan, Goseoiwan!
Goseoiwan?
What do you mean?
Where is Goseoiwan?
Isn't that a very far-off place from the battlefield, on the western border?
Yes, yes, so we longer have to fight in the battlefield.
His Majesty has appointed the General as the city lord of Goseoiwan City.
Why is he the city lord of Goseoiwan City?
Does that mean the General won't be going to the battlefield?
Yes, that's right.
But Cho Yeong, what is important is that we'll be elsewhere.
Now is the time.
In time of war...
Fish season!
Let's go and eat seafood.
That's not necessary.
We have been blessed.
- Then, our General in future will...
- We'll be able to grasp 2 or 3 in one go.
That rotten girl, why did she push me?
Where are you going?
Go and pack your bags quickly.
Do it quickly!
Those rascals are really...
What should I do about Cho Yeong?
Didn't she touch my chest before leaving?
The look in her eyes...
What should I do?
Really...
General, what exactly happened?
You must have heard?
How can His Majesty do this?
This is too much.
Sending you to Goseoiwan is just like exiling you.
It's not necessary for all of you to follow me.
I've recommended all of you to Generals Ui Jik and Eun Sang.
So don't worry.
I can't do that.
How can we go to battle without you, General?
We can't do that either.
Don't say something so feeble.
All of you are now good military leaders.
Even without me, all of you will be able to perform great deeds for the country.
You've said it countless times before, whether it's life or death we'll be together.
All this time we've held onto those words and survived until now.
Yes, I understand how all of you feel, but the matter has already been decided.
Enter the service of the 2 generals, and perform great deeds.
You mustn't die, continue to live.
Even if we die, we'll only abide by your orders, General.
Can't we go and beg His Majesty?
General, please reconsider.
That was a royal edict.
Don't think of unnecessary things, just follow my orders.
If you don't do as I say, I won't see you again.
Is the news of the General going to Goseoiwan true?
Yes, I'm telling the truth, why won't you believe me?
Really... all of you should go home and pack your bags.
Hurry up, go home.
Who said we have to pack our bags?
Absolutely not!
The General must go with us to the battlefield.
This rascal, His Majesty has already decided.
Dae Su!
Yong Su!
What can the two of you do?
Do you want to confront His Majesty?
We must reason with him!
This is so senseless!
Dok Gae, you should think about this.
Does it make sense for the General not to be able to go to battle?
Yes, although it's unreasonable,
His Majesty has his own views.
Then let's resolve this!
Whether it's His Majesty or the Jade Emperor!
Let's go and resolve this.
All of you have gone mad.
Do you want to die?
Do you know where that place is?
Where do you think you're going to resolve this?
Cho Yeong, you can't do that.
Stop them, Cho Yeong.
Cho Yeong!
Cho Yeong!
She's left again.
Where did she go?
You bunch of rascals.
Your Highness.
Why are you here?
Please persuade His Majesty, Your Highness.
No matter what, General Gye Baek must be allowed to go to battle.
It's not within my power to do so.
Your Highness is capable of doing this.
Please persuade His Majesty.
It's not something you should interfere with.
You should leave.
Your Highness, this concerns General Gye Baek.
It's a matter concerning General Gye Baek.
All of you should leave.
Yes, Your Highness.
I've watched you loving General Gye Baek my whole life.
Do you want to die?
Where do you think you are, that you dare to talk nonsense!
Don't you know, for you he'd even give up his life.
Agassi, please persuade His Majesty.
Agassi, you can't just leave things as they are.
It's not something you should interfere with.
Leave!
Agassi, please do something.
You can do something about this, isn't that so?
You have really changed a lot.
Is General Gye Baek more important than your own life?
Yes, he is more important than my own life.
So, please kill me if it can be exchanged for his life.
Please revoke the order to send the General to Goseoiwan.
That's no different than being banished.
Do you really want to die?
How dare you interfere in matters concerning the state.
This worthless life, even if it's discarded for the General's sake, I've no regrets.
You are really...
Agassi, I beg of you...
Aren't you now begging me as one of General's subordinates?
What?
You flatter me, I don't deserve such praise and honour as your General.
I'm unable to fulfill your request.
Your Highness.
The Queen's bestowment declaration, and the jade seal.
Your Majesty, urgent report!
What is it?
The soldiers are demonstrating outside the palace walls.
What?
A demonstration?
The soldiers want you to revoke the appointment of General Gye Baek as city lord.
Your Majesty, please fulfill our request.
Please fulfill our request.
Your Majesty, please take care of General Gye Baek.
Your Majesty, please fulfill our request!
Your Majesty, please fulfill our request!
How did things go?
Soldiers from Rim City will be coming as well.
The military order has spread, the country will be in turmoil.
You did well, well done.
Your Majesty, please fulfill our request!
Your Majesty, please fulfill our request!
What do you call this?
How dare they hold a demonstration on the day of the installation of the Queen.
Mobilize all the royal guards, and the guards from the History department, here.
Yes, Your Majesty.
No, bring Gye Baek here first!
General Gye Baek?
This must be the work of Gye Baek, who was dissatisfied with my order.
Seize the leader of the protesters and bring him here.
What are you hesitating for?
Bring Gye Baek here immediately!
Yes, Your Majesty.
General!
General!
Something serious has happened.
A serious matter.
What serious matter?
That, Dae Su, Yong Su and Cho Yeong gathered all the soldiers outside the palace gates and staged a protest against the royal order.
What do you mean by that?
His Majesty has issued an edict to arrest me and take me over there?
My apologies, General.
There is nothing you should be apologetic about, let's go.
Your Majesty, please fulfill our request.
Fulfill our request!
How about allowing the soldiers to go back?
Are you not Baekje's military leader?
Does it make sense to you that General Gye Baek cannot go to battle?
Then what can we do?
I fear if this continues there'll be an order to punish all of you.
We have weapons too.
If you're trying to threaten us, just move aside.
It is not a threat.
I'm protecting this place because I'm abiding by General Gye Baek's orders to do so.
General instructed us to defend this place well.
These are the royal guards and the guards from the history department.
Leave this place quickly.
Your Majesty, please withdraw your edict.
Withdraw it.
Were you the one who incited this, General?
No.
Let me go and speak to them, they'll leave after that.
Release me, jojeong jwapyeong.
You really didn't incite your men to do this?
Didn't I say no earlier?
Don't you know me well, jojeong jwapyeong?
Please release me.
Let me go and settle this.
Ask His Majesty to release me for a moment.
We must stop this before the problem escalates.
Release General Gye Baek for a moment?
Did you just say that?
But Your Majesty, no matter how stupid I am,
I feel this is unrelated to General Gye Baek.
Looks like this was done by the troops under his command by themselves.
Have you come up with a clear finding?
He's a heinous criminal who is impeding the Queen's installation, and the instigator of the protest.
Lock him up in the prison and ask him to make a confession.
But Your Majesty...
I'm telling you to make him plead guilty.
Plead guilty!
You can't do that?
Let me do it then.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I understand.
Your Majesty, do you really want to get rid of Gye Baek in this manner?
Gye Baek is the instigator behind his troops launching a protest and is therefore a heinous criminal.
I cannot forgive him.
The General is not the kind of person to incite them.
Just send him to the battlefield.
Your bestowment ceremony as Queen has not been completed yet.
I told you to stay put until the installation is over.
Good, this is our opportunity.
Your Majesty, naedu jwapyeong and naesin jwapyeong are seeking an audience.
Come in!
Your Majesty,
General Gye Baek is innocent.
This was started impetuously by the soldiers themselves.
They are Gye Baek's subordinates.
Gye Baek has defied my edict this time by inciting the soldiers.
Your Majesty,
You can't punish General Gye Baek.
If this goes on the soldiers will launch an uprising.
Uprising?
Is that so?
Tell them to do it.
Do you think I will yield to them?
Your Majesty,
Baek Ji cannot be split up.
This is Silla's...
I want to punish him!
This is something we must deal with first, before dealing with Silla.
Your Majesty is too stubborn,
Gye Baek is really innocent...
Naedu jwapyeong!
You've forgotten that you've been to the King of Hell?
Watch what you say.
Children, children.
There's a problem.
The General has been arrested because of your actions.
General has been arrested?
If he wants to arrest anybody, he should arrest us.
Why did he arrest the General?
Really...
He can't deal with our large numbers.
That's why he arrested the General instead.
What shall we do if the General gets punished for incitement?
The General will definitely be punished for that.
We can't allow the General to be punished for our wrongs.
This is really too much.
Let's not just sit here, let's launch an attack on the palace.
All of you...
That's a rebellion, a rebellion.
If you do that, all of us will die!
Then what shall we do?
We have to save the General first.
We can't do that.
Armed conflict should be our last resort.
Let me go and check out the situation first.
We should inform jojeong jwapyeong that this has nothing to do with the General.
I'll go and tell him.
I'll go with you.
I'll follow too.
I'm not going.
Your Excellency, Jwapyeong.
General Gye Baek is innocent.
We were the ones who incited the soldiers.
We are the instigators.
Your Excellency, jwapyeong.
We are at fault.
Please release General Gye Baek.
How many times must I say this.
General Gye Baek is under investigation now.
Once his name has been cleared, we'll release him.
First disperse the soldiers.
The soldiers coming together was unplanned.
We don't know what to do either.
Once you release the General, they will leave.
Please let me see the General first, Your Excellency.
Let me have a look at his situation.
Don't you know that a person under investigation isn't allowed to meet anybody?
Please help us, Your Excellency.
Pleading with me is useless.
The General will be fine.
All of you should go and convince the soldiers to disperse.
Your Majesty,
You want to execute General Gye Baek?
General Gye Baek is innocent.
How can you execute an innocent person?
I've made up my mind.
Your Majesty,
The investigation isn't complete yet.
I'm appealing to you to rescind your order.
Those soldiers outside are whose soldiers?
They are Gye Baek's soldiers.
Even if Gye Baek didn't incite them, he can't escape from his guilt.
Your Majesty,
This is wrong.
Please consider our reasoning.
I won't repeat this again.
I will execute Gye Baek.
After that I'll disband those soldiers.
If there are any people who still opposes me,
I'll treat them as part of Gye Baek's clique, and punish them in a similar fashion.
Heavens, even a dictatorship isn't like this.
He will not listen to anybody.
The political council meeting is no more.
There's no way to stop His Majesty.
He abolished the political council meeting from the outset because of this.
Because he wants to be a dictator.
If he's going to do this, whether it's earlier or later, it makes no difference.
We had better try to save Gye Baek first.
If this continues, Gye Baek might not survive.
I must go and inform Gye Baek's soldiers.
There is only one way.
Please release the General.
Release the General!
What are we going to do now?
According to naedu jwapyeong, the General will not be able to avoid punishment.
What do you mean, what do we do now?
Just do as I say.
Let's launch a direct attack.
We can't allow all the soldiers to enter.
First of all, we have to save the General.
Are you talking about breaking into the prison?
We'll break into the prison tonight.
Your Majesty,
What has happened?
They've entered the history department and will break into the prison.
I know they will do that.
General, please come out quickly.
What are all of you doing?
Breaking into prison, what are all of you thinking?
We had no other option, because there's an order to execute you, General.
General, come out quickly!
We are running out of time.
The soldiers will be here soon.
I am fine.
All of you should leave.
Go and hide far away.
No, we can't do that.
We came fully prepared.
We want to be together with you.
If you were to die here, General, we would follow suit.
Get ready!
Arrest them!
Leave them to us, go quickly!
Our soldiers are outside.
In case... if all of you die...
General, don't be like this.
Hurry up and leave.
I won't leave,
I will go and meet His Majesty.
I will convince His Majesty.
All of you go and disperse our soldiers.
General.
Put down your swords, all of you!
Charge.
Anyone who dares to harm the General will die by my hands.
Put your weapons down.
Don't try to stop us.
Yong Su, go and report this to our men outside.
Hyeong, you go, (Hyeong - older brother)
I want to be here to protect the General.
Your Majesty,
I granted you the post of a city lord, but you... you still want to rebel against me with your soldiers.
Your Majesty, these immature children are behaving like this because they want to save me.
Kill me, but please release them.
Fine then.
Fine.
If that is what you want, then we shall do as you wish.
Your Majesty,
The General has committed no wrong.
It is all our fault.
Move aside!
Kill us, but release the General.
Move aside!
Cho Yeong, move away.
Your Majesty,
Your Majesty,
Your Majesty,
Are you all right?
How dare you...
You!
Dare to lay your hands on me?
Cho Yeong.
Cho Yeong.
Cho Yeong.
Who else dares to stop me?
Who?
Your Majesty,
Your Majesty,
Your Majesty,
Are you all courting death too?
I will kill all of you.
Kill me!
Kill everyone!
Just do whatever Your Majesty wishes!
Do you really think that I won't dare to do it?
Fine.
I'll start with you.
Your Majesty,
You should stop now.
Move aside!
Your Majesty,
Everyone is looking at you, Your Majesty.
You are to disappear now.
Disappear at once!
If you reappear, you will die.
Cho Yeong.
Cho Yeong.
How is her condition?
We have done everything we could, but she has lost too much blood.
Her condition is really critical.
You must save her, you must!
General, tonight will be the critical test.
Cho Yeong.
Can you hear me?
You must stay alive.
No matter what, you have to stay alive.
Cho Yeong.
Cho Yeong.
General...
You're awake?
Wait,
I'll go and bring the physician.
General, don't go.
What if I were to die when you're not around, General?
No, you won't, you will not die.
I'm afraid... don't go.
Stay by my side.
Fine, I will.
I'm not going.
General.
I may be dying, but my dream has come true.
I have always dreamed that you'll stay by my side like this,
and look at me the way you're doing now.
General...
Yes.
I'm very ordinary, and am not beautiful,
but there is something beautiful in my heart.
I like you, General,
more than anyone else in the world.
I, Eun Go, will really let go of you now, Gye Baek.
General Gye Baek has left.
I know.
Did you come here to berate me?
Who dares to blame Your Majesty?
No, blame me for everything.
Everyone blames me for wanting to take Gye Baek's life.
I envy Gye Baek.
Who in Baekje can be compared to Gye Baek, able to capture so many people's hearts?
Your Majesty,
You can catch a bird in the sky using a bow, and the fish in the ocean using bait, but what you can't catch is a person's heart.
I have worked so hard but have yet to touch the people's hearts.
How did Gye Baek do it so easily?
Your Majesty,
General Gye Baek has already left, and he won't ever be coming back.
I know.
Don't worry, I have promised you, that if Gye Baek does not come back, I will spare his life.
Last night was a long dark night,
I don't wish for another night like that.
-= 12 years later.
Seorabeol =-
And thus, out of the 40 cities captured by Gye Baek, we have recaptured 30.
-= Gim Yu Sin =- This is all to your credit, Great General.
-= Gim Yu Sin =- You can't say it's to my credit.
We were able to recapture those cities because Gye Baek's hands were tied.
('hands tied' metaphorically: unable to act for some reason)
It was as easy as drinking cold porridge.
This is the result of Your Majesty having sowed the seeds of discontent in Baekje long ago.
-= Gim Chun Chu =- Although I knew Ui Ja was jealous of Gye Baek, I didn't expect him to tie him up for so long.
Will Your Majesty be like Ui Ja, envious of me?
I'm afraid I'll end up like Gye Baek if I'm not careful.
I'm worried.
Yes.
I envy you as well, General.
Even if a 3 year old child doesn't know of me, he will still recognize you, General.
Then Your Majesty, you can take my sword and go onto the battlefield yourself.
Should I do that?
Great General.
I'm entrusting this to you once again.
You must, you certainly must seek revenge for my daughter and son-in-law, so that I can personally behead Ui Ja.
Don't worry, Your Majesty.
I will definitely exterminate Baekje and then attack Goguryeo, and unify the three kingdoms as a gift to you.
Thank you, my Great General.
Your Majesty, His Excellency Jang Son has arrived.
Invite him in.
Welcome, Sir.
Great General is here too.
Baekje's envoy has once again paid a visit to Tang?
Yes, it's concerning the installation of the Queen and the Crown Prince once again.
How shall we handle this?
Tang hasn't acknowledged it's validity for 12 years, will Tang change its mind this time round?
Don't worry, we'll refuse to acknowledge it.
Very good.
Baekje is now known to the outside world as a country without a Queen and Crown Prince.
Are they still refusing to acknowledge our Queen and Crown Prince?
What are they up to?
Your Majesty, this is all a scheme by Gim Chun Chu to insult the Baekje royal family.
Gim Chun Chu's second son is a military leader in Tang.
He's bribed the officials, thus not allowing us to meet the Emperor.
Under these circumstances, we were unable to seek their acknowledgement.
Your Majesty should stop being obsessed with it.
Your servant reckons that's the case as well.
Gim Chun Chu and Lord Jang Son, and also Gim In Mun, makes this impossible.
Whether Great Tang acknowledges it or not, I'm still the Queen of this country as bestowed by Your Majesty.
Please don't worry about it.
Tang, who only listen to Silla, what's the use of having a diplomatic relationship with them?
We might as well sever all diplomatic ties with Tang.
Your Majesty, you absolutely mustn't do that!
Tang holds the balance of power in the central plains.
If we become enemies with them it'll be like giving wings to Silla.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Though it's a fact that Tang has insulted our Baekje, to severe all our diplomatic ties with them is equivalent to turning them into an outright enemy.
Gim Chun Chu, I will definitely behead you!
Your Majesty,
Gim Chun Chu, who has such regard for Tang, will pay the price one of these days.
Please wait for the right time.
What is more important is the collapse of our borders.
Yes, Dusa Fort, Okmun Fort and also Gokak Fort have been captured.
We have lost 50 000 soldiers.
50 000 make up half of Baekje's military power.
We need to come up with a counterplan, Your Majesty.
Do you want me to recall Gye Baek again?
Father, father.
-= Hwang Deung County, Heuk Fortress =-
What is it?
Mother, come quickly.
Father, I made this.
Did you really?
I am so hungry, so hungry.
Dok Gae elder is once again trying to plot an eight trigrams scheme.
(scheming to dither.)
Wait and see, there'll come a day when I'll leave this place.
I'm really dying of hunger.
Then just give it up.
I can't give up, I'll never give up!
Just think, we have been here 12 years already, don't you want to know what's happening out there?
I can't live on like this!
Aren't you two tired of this place?
No, we're not tired at all.
It's good to be at peace.
How is peaceful good?
The world must have crisis.
A crisis really happened!
What shall we do?
Give him some water.
General, what are you thinking?
I feel really at peace.
Long ago, my dead father said this to me.
Don't wield a sword, and don't go into battle, make an honest living as a farmer and contribute to others.
Just live simply like that.
If he can see me living like this, he'll be very happy.
Yes, he will.
My only wish is for the world outside to be just as peaceful as here.
We will have to keep believing in that.
Only if Gim Chun Chu dies, will my Hyo be acknowledged.
Gim Chun Chu, you have gone overboard with your insults.
We should have killed him then.
Your Majesty, I'm sorry,
How about if we make use of Gim Chun Chu and Gim Yu Sin?
How can we do that?
Do you have any ideas, jwapyeong?
Your servant has a slave who was born in Silla, and is now working under Gim Yu Sin.
We can send him to Silla to meet up with Gim Chun Chu and Gim Yu Sin, and then make a request for Tang's acknowledgment.
So how should we reward them?
What Silla is worried about now, is when they attack us,
Goguryeo will attack them from the south.
Our Baekje and Goguryeo are allies.
If Goguryeo were to launch an attack on them, we'll inform them.
So we'll be helping Silla?
Your Majesty, we're not betraying Baekje, we're betraying Goguryeo instead.
As for that price.
After the Crown Prince's installation, we can sever our ties with them.
Are you looking for me, jwapyeong, sir.
Are you still a Silla subject?
Sir, I am neither a Silla nor a Baekje subject,
I am solely yours.
Aren't you the one who treated me, a prisoner of war, as a human being?
I thank you for thinking of me in that way.
Can you help me to do a difficult matter?
Please let me have your orders.
I will do anything for you, sir.
Accompany me to Seorabeol to meet with Gim Yu Sin.
If this mission is a success, I will not forget your contribution.
So you're saying if we help you with the Queen and the Crown Prince's installation, you will report to us Goguryeo's troop movements?
Yes.
Do you think this is an acceptable transaction?
I, am Gim Yu Sin.
Even if we don't know Goguryeo's troop movements, we'll still know if they attack our southern borders.
So, what do you want?
If what you want is to pass through our Baekje, then it's not necessary to discuss further.
If you are bent on killing a person who's already on the verge of dying, your king will be mocked by others.
Gye Baek, isn't it Gye Baek?
It's laughable the way the situation has changed.
But what we fear most is
Gye Baek cooperating with Baekje again.
If he doesn't reappear in battle, then Ui Ja's life will fall into my hands.
But to attack Gye Baek, who has laid down his sword, is loathsome.
What you mean is, you feel this is despicable?
That's right.
Ui Ja killed my daughter and son-in-law, who had surrendered.
I want a tooth for a tooth, an eye for an eye.
Your Majesty, what Your Majesty really wants, your servant knows better than anyone else.
But in order to unify the three kingdoms, we have to remain calm.
Great General.
Your servant doesn't want a victory tainted with sordidness.
Is it really true?
Did Gim Yu Sin say that as long as we report to him about Goguryeo's troop movements, he will agree to our deal?
Am I right?
Yes.
Great, that's really great!
Jwapyeong has saved us, mother and child.
Thank you.
We'll share whatever benefits we derive in the future with jwapyeong.
Your servant only did what I should do.
Your Majesty, can I ask you something?
Please, speak.
Our borders are about to be crossed, why is it His Majesty doesn't recall Gye Baek?
Why did you ask that all of a sudden?
After meeting Gim Yu Sin, I feel he's not an ordinary person.
Seems like in future, he'll continue to attack our borders.
Even if that is the case,
His Majesty will never again delegate any task to General Gye Baek.
Do you want to revisit our past nightmares?
General Gye Baek, as far as Baekje is concerned, is as good as dead.
Naesin jwapyeong!
Did you implement the order that I laid down previously?
To distribute the lands to the people?
Only if they own landed property, can they continue to survive.
We must reduce the number of people who're homeless.
Now, the handicraft industry continues to provide them with work.
Within a year, the people will be either farmers or craftsmen.
They can then hold on to their own property.
Your Majesty, urgent report!
What is the matter?
Silla's Gim Yu Sin has attacked Seodeok City.
All our 5 000 soldiers were annihilated.
General Ui Jik is also gravely injured.
Go to the village, and bring Gye Baek here.
Can we really bring Gye Baek here?
Gye Baek, bring him over.
-= Next Episode Preview =-
Where do you want to go?
To look for my precious sword.
I won't leave this place, don't worry.
Hands which used to wield swords are now holding farming tools.
It suits you.
His Majesty is here, are you going out?
The end result is His Majesty is still the loser.
Whether it was before or now, I...
I'll look into it.
We must move all the guards and soldiers to the border.
Won't this cause the palace to be in danger?
What if there's internal strife?
Gye Baek, you're right, it's General.
It's General Yeong Gye Somun.
We must bring Gim Yu Sin down in this battle.
Give this to General Gim Yu Sin quickly.
Was Gye Baek injured?
I can't believe in His Majesty.
He will surely try to harm you, General.
Why do I have this strange feeling?
This won't happen unless there's a leak in our intelligence.
Could it be...
It's not, it cannot be...
-= Episode 34 =-
It's already so late, what's the matter, Your Excellency?
I have an urgent matter to report to His Majesty.
What?
What is wrong with you?
It's an emergency, open the door.
Yes.
Open the door!
Isn't this naesin jwapyeong?
It's already so late, where are you heading?
Do you want to see His Majesty?
Do you want to tell him that I'm a Silla spy?
Is that your admission?
I wonder.
It's the original written by Your Majesty.
As Baekje's Queen, aren't you ashamed of yourself?
It's a bit disgraceful.
No matter how you curse me, I'm fine with it.
I don't intend to explain and make you understand.
Even if I die, your sins will be exposed.
I won't let that happen.
Your Majesty, how do you intend to deal with him?
Don't tell me you're thinking of sparing him?
Naesin jwapyeong is someone needed by Baekje.
Your servant is aware of that too, Your Majesty.
It's better if we can bribe him and bring him over to our side, but he's not a person who will cross over to our side.
If we let him live, that will signal our death.
Please make up your mind quickly.
Naesin jwapyeong, it would have been better if I had a grudge against you.
If bribery would work, I would offer you anything you wanted.
I would also let you join us.
You want to kill me to silence me?
Please forgive me.
Your Majesty, how can you not know?
The person whom you should beg for forgiveness is not me.
You should seek Baekje's forgiveness.
Why did you establish contact with Gim Chun Chu?
It was not my intention to betray Baekje.
I just wanted to do a transaction with Gim Chun Chu, but things got out of hand.
Why must you do that kind of transaction?
What else do you lack?
I needed Tang's acknowledgement that I'm the Queen and my son is the Crown Prince, and to let the whole world know of that fact.
That mere formality, how important can that be?
Didn't the king of this country already acknowledge you as the Queen, and your son as the Crown Prince?
I need, I urgently need that formal status.
You have said His Majesty has acknowledged me as the Queen, but what if His Majesty were to pass away, what would I do then?
You, naesin jwapyeong, naedu jwapyeong and all the noblemen hate me.
My power comes from His Majesty.
Without His Majesty, my power will also vanish.
Even if His Majesty dies, you're still the Queen.
Until I obtain Tang's acknowledgement, I'm not.
My status and powers need to be acknowledged by others, only then will they become valid.
Just for that, you betrayed Baekje?
How can such a smart person like you fall into such a trap?
It's still not too late.
Go and beg His Majesty for mercy.
Repent sincerely, and accept your just punishment.
I will do that when my Hyo ascends the throne.
At that time, I will abdicate and become a nun.
I will pray for everyone's souls for the rest of my life.
Your Majesty.
I, Seong Chung will die, I will die for your sake.
Furthermore, I will not hate you, and therefore, I beg you, please return to being the Queen of Baekje who will serve the country.
Naesin jwapyeong, you're a loyal subject of this country.
I will repent before you sometime in the future.
I, Seong Chung, in this place here we have sworn to be brothers.
Our convictions are...
We will not crave for power.
We will not crave for money.
We will not crave for status and fame.
We'll only focus on resurrecting Baekje and the people's livelihood, without greed.
Even if my physical body dies, my soul will live on.
Hyeongnim.
(Hyeongnum - respected older brother)
When did you come?
I just stopped here momentarily before leaving on my journey.
Where are you going?
Is it very far?
If you say far, it's far.
If you say near, then it's near.
Gye Baek, I really do have good, sworn brothers.
I can now entrust my will to other people.
So, even if the road I'm travelling is lonesome, whatistheretoregret?
Please take care of my funeral preparations.
Hyeongnim, where exactly are you going?
Your Majesty, your servant Gye Baek reporting.
We have successfully recaptured Tobi City.
It'll be fine to just guard the city for the time being.
Your servant would like to continue with the offensive against other cities.
I'm going to go to Seorabeol to check out any short cuts and their military fortification.
After I've completed my survey and investigations, I'll be returning to Sabi City.
Someone out there.
Yes, General.
Deliver this to His Majesty.
Yes.
General, we're ready to go to Dongjang City.
Yes, but I've this feeling something has happened in Sabi City.
What?
It would be good if we could complete our scouting of Dongjang City and Doksan City quickly.
Then General, shall I go to Sabi City and check it out?
You want to go by yourself?
Didn't you say you've not been to Goguryeo and Silla, and you'll accept all the investigation tasks.
Why are you finding fault with me?
Isn't the General worried about Sabi City?
That's why I made my offer.
It's not that.
I had a strange dream, and I'm probably feeling a bit sensitive.
Let's hurry up and get ready to leave.
Yes, General.
Yes.
That should be a good place.
Gye Baek sent this.
Dongjang City and Doksan City are the two fortresses that can hinder the Silla army.
Gye Baek should be able to capture both cities.
But we're short of troops.
With our present troops, it's barely enough to defend Tobi City.
How can we increase our military strength?
We can train the newly recruited troops, but they can't be considered elite troops.
First of all, we'll request the noblemen to deliver up all their private soldiers.
That won't be easy, do you have any ideas?
I will consult with naesin jwapyeong concerning this matter.
Fine, you must definitely come up with a plan.
Is anyone in?
Is anyone in?
Hey, Seong Chung!
Seong Chung!
What happened?
Quick, wake up!
Hey, Hey.
Somebody, please come!
Is there anyone out there?
This can't be, this must not be!
Get up!
Get up!
Please get up!
I'm telling you to wake up.
I'm telling you to wake up!
What are you saying?
Seong Chung is dead?
I'm so sorry, Your Majesty.
Naesin jwapyeong died in his home, and was discovered by naedu jwapyeong...
This doesn't make sense.
No, this can't be.
Your Majesty.
He was fine yesterday.
Just one night and he's dead, how can I believe that?
Your Majesty.
My Queen...
What is this?
Your Majesty, I can't believe this.
Heaven didn't forsake me, how could this have happened?
Why?
Are you sure it's a Silla arrow?
Yes, jojeong jwapyeong.
This must surely be the work of a Silla spy.
Jwapyeong, please don't be too sad, it will harm your body.
We know you're sad, leave the funeral preparations to us.
Do you know who the culprit is?
It must be either a Silla spy or an assassin.
Silla spy?
Yes, that's right.
The culprit is a Silla spy.
Just wait, Seong Chung.
I will definitely avenge your death.
Handle naesin jwapyeong's body with respect and dignity.
You handled this properly, didn't you?
Of course, Your Majesty.
Anyone who takes a look will conclude it's the work of a Silla assassin.
Your Majesty, naedu jwapyeong is seeking an audience with you.
The one who should come, is here.
You must be grieving over naesin jwapyeong's death.
I am sad too.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Yes, one thing.
What is it?
Go and see His Majesty right now, and inform His Majesty the one who's liaising secretly with Silla is you.
Also inform His Majesty, your secret was discovered by Seong Chung, and you therefore had to kill him.
What nonsense is this, naedu jwapyeong?
How dare you accuse Her Majesty of being a Silla spy?
Let it be, wisa jwapyeong.
Your Majesty.
Naedu jwapyeong, you're consumed with grief and are therefore not your normal self.
Therefore I'll just pretend I didn't hear what you said just now.
Seong Chung, compared to anyone else, was much wiser.
Do you think a person like him would not have made prior arrangements?
He had evidence of Your Majesty and Silla's secret liaison.
Seong Chung has left the evidence with me.
Looks like you have really lost your mind.
I'm really worried about you, naedu jwapyeong.
I'll give you time to think about this.
If you don't believe me, come to Seong Chung's house at midnight tomorrow.
I'll show you the evidence.
Don't worry, it's probably just a trap set by naedu jwapyeong.
He's just trying to test us, he's doing this deliberately.
If we go there, it'll only confirm his suspicions.
Are you sure you've destroyed all the evidence?
Of course, Your Majesty.
All the evidence in naesin jwapyeong's hands was destroyed.
Didn't Your Majesty see with your own eyes?
Naedu jwapyeong isn't a simple person.
Are you sure he's really bluffing us?
I'm so ill at ease.
Your Majesty, if you're so ill at ease, how about if we were to kill naedu jwapyeong too?
He was so close to naesin jwapyeong, he won't give up on this.
That's enough.
If we do that, things will become worse.
It will make His Majesty suspicious.
Yes, Your Majesty.
You can leave now.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I was hoping this was just a dream.
A nightmare.
I have something to say to you.
Your Majesty, youmustlisten,eveniftheadvice proffered is contrary to your own views.
I'm telling you to leave!
This council meeting must...
I've always regretted doing that, but I've not been able to bring myself to apologize to you.
I'll put in my best efforts to become a good and wise king.
I know you would want that too.
My loyal subject, my loyal brother, Seong Chung.
Now, who'll be able to advise me, and tell me the right path to take?
How can you go and leave me behind?
Your Majesty.
We've completed our investigations into naesin jwapyeong's death.
Tell me.
Naesin jwapyeong was killed by a Silla spy.
The knife we found on naesin jwapyeong's body had the markings of Silla.
The arows that killed his guards were also Silla's arrows.
The Silla spies dared to enter our capital city and kill our minister?
Yes, Your Majesty.
How can such a thing happen?
I won't forgive Silla.
Your Majesty, it's all your servant's fault.
Please punish me.
Please punish us.
Don't forget, tonight at midnight.
Look here, Seong Chung, if the Queen doesn't appear, it'll confirm that you didn't have any evidence.
Your temperament is not the same as mine.
Even if it was necessary to die, I should have been first.
If something happens to me, tell naedu jwapyeong this.
Even if I'm not around, he must be careful and watch his words.
Yes.
He told me to watch my words?
Did he say anything else?
I'm so sorry, he told you to be careful of the sewage bucket mouth, and to look carefully.
Sewage bucket?
This friend, seriously.
Please forgive him, he's a person whose mouth can be likened to a sewage bucket.
Sewage bucket!
I saved you and now you...
You should take a good look at yourself.
Your mouth is like a sewage bucket.
It's a pity, but the world is just like his mouth, a sewage bucket.
Everything will be fine if the world is like my mouth.
Sewage bucket...
Yes, right.
Just like you said, who would want to touch this sewage bucket?
The Queen has missed the appointment.
I won't forgive her.
I will absolutely not forgive her.
What are you saying, you suspect the Queen?
I suspect the spy who leaked the intelligence of Tobi City is Her Majesty, so I've been investigating all this time.
Are you making sense?
Why would the Queen?
No, it can't be her.
This is the evidence left by Seong Chung.
This is the reason for Seong Chung's death.
Do you understand now?
Seong Chung, was killed by the Queen.
The Queen has destroyed this country by killing it's loyal subject.
Your Majesty, it's very late.
What is this, Your Majesty?
What is this?
You really don't know?
Your Majesty.
How?
You really were liaising secretly with Gim Chun Chu, just to get Tang's acknowledgement.
It's not what you think.
Your Majesty.
I am innocent.
This is a conspiracy.
I've been framed, Your Majesty!
Please believe me.
Trust me!
How could I do such a thing?
For you to be so uneasy, are you afraid that if I'm dead, you'll have no one to rely on?
Therefore you did this kind of thing?
Your Majesty, why don't you believe me?
I... didn't I say I was wronged?
Are you going to punish me, Your Majesty?
Let my death prove my innocence.
Then I'll prove my innocence.
I, Eun Go, cannot accompany Your Majesty any longer.
Eun Go, plead for mercy.
Confess to your crime.
If you do that, I...
I...
Your Majesty, I'm not guilty!
Even if I die, I will not yield.
It was you who deceived me!
Let go of me!
If Your Majesty regards me as a spy, then I deserve to die, don't I?
You're really wicked.
If you confess and apologize to Seong Chung, if you apologize,
I will forgive you.
But, how can...
How can...
Why should I have to do that?
My parents died because they were suspected of being spies.
My uncle and clan members died because of Your Majesty.
Now I'm the only one left.
Are you asking me to die as a spy also?
I can't do that.
No.
Your Majesty.
Yes, belittle me, scold me or curse me.
But there's nothing I can do.
Do you want to conceal everything?
Why must you come and look for me?
You didn't expose her in front of all the ministers, but came here and made me suffer this unbearable pain.
Your Majesty, this matter can only be resolved by Your Majesty.
Eun Go lost everything because of me.
Because of my father and mother, and also because of my greed, she lost everything.
It was me, it was me who caused her to change and become like this.
How can I abandon her now?
Your Majesty.
You can't let her off just because of your personal matters!
I know that too.
But if everybody knows the Queen is a spy, this country's state of affairs will be thrown into chaos.
Furthermore, the people will no longer trust royalty.
All this is what Gim Chun Chu wished for.
Heung Su, can't you just forgive her?
I can't do that.
I have to go.
You can't leave.
You can't leave.
She's the Queen who killed my brother, how can you expect me to face her?
If you were to leave me, what will happen to this country?
You're just like Gye Baek.
Don't do it for my sake.
Stay back for the country's sake.
Can't you even do that?
My character is not good.
I can't do what you ask.
But...
I will complete the book on the art of warfare that Seong Chung left behind.
That will be the final time we'll interact.
The evidence really existed?
Did naedu jwapyeong take this and go to His Majesty?
We have to kill naedu jwapyeong, we can't leave things like this.
Foolish matters should only be done just once.
But Your Majesty, naedu jwapyeong is holding our weakness in his hands.
This will bring us trouble later on.
Everything is over now.
What kind of person is naedu jwapyeong?
Only by killing him will our troubles be over.
Your Majesty, your servant will deal with this quietly.
Naedu jwapyeong is leaving this country because he doesn't want to see this country thrown into chaos.
The one you have to silence is not him.
Kill Cho Gwe.
What are you saying?
I've said I won't liaise with Gim Chun Chu anymore.
Do you understand?
So kill him.
Stop here.
Let him go.
Please don't kill me, sir.
I won't betray you, sir.
I have my orders, so don't blame me.
Sir, please release me.
Just like you spare me now, I'll be able to save you next time, sir.
Move away.
Yes.
What are you saying?
Baekje has chosen to go to war with Tang, isn't that so?
Baekje will be attacked by Silla and Tang.
Gim Yu Sin said he'll give me an important position.
If Baekje is annihilated,
I will definitely save you, sir.
Brat.
Our Baekje will not perish so easily.
I know, but nobody knows what the future may hold, don't you agree?
Really good, it smells really good.
There's no place that can be compared to here.
The scenery and living conditions are good.
The women are good looking.
The wine is good.
Everybody is living well.
If we didn't have Dok Gae elder here, it would be really good.
I knew it would be like this.
When did it start?
The moment I open my mouth, you talk back.
Do you think I'm easy to bully?
General, are you going to see His Majesty?
Yes.
You're too much.
You should first return home.
That's right.
Your wife will be longing to see you.
What about the children?
What's with the clothes you're wearing?
General...
Seems like someone has died.
What happened?
Naesin jwapyeong, he...
Seong Chung hyeongnim, what happened to him?
Tell me quickly.
What really happened?
What happened?
You're here.
Seong Chung hyeongnim...
Seong Chung hyeongnim has passed away.
Is that a fact?
Gye Baek.
Has Seong Chung hyeongnim really passed away?
Yes.
Your Majesty.
In accordance with your order,
I was very meticulous.
They won't be able to find the slightest trace.
That's enough.
Your Majesty.
Make plans to quietly leave the palace with the Queen.
Just keep it simple.
Why are we going out of the palace all of a sudden?
Where are we going?
I'm intending to go and see Seong Chung.
Who was it?
Who killed hyeongnim?
You know it, right?
Heung Su, although this is shameless of me, please don't tell Gye Baek about this.
I can't do that.
We can't let Gye Baek know.
We definitely can't do that.
Don't you know his temperament too well?
Even if it's not me, sooner or later, he'll come to know.
Yes, even if there comes a time when he'll know, but please keep this a secret for the time being for my sake.
Seong Chung died at the hands of the Silla assassins.
Are you intending to deceive Gye Baek once again?
That's why I said this is a shameless request.
This time... the matter that happened was due to my incompetence.
Heung Su, please help me.
I can't do that.
I absolutely can't do that.
Tell me.
Who really killed Seong Chung hyeongnim.
Your Majesty, why didn't you inform us earlier?
There's no need to go to any trouble.
I've only come to pray.
Yes.
Naedu jwapyeong and General Gye Baek have just arrived too.
Why are you not saying anything?
Who was it exactly?
It was a Silla assassin.
Silla assassin?
Seong Chung hyeongnim... was killed by a Silla assassin?
Let's go in quickly.
My Queen, you should return first.
We're already here, how can you ask me to return to the palace?
I want to go in too.
Didn't I tell you to return to the palace first?
Accompany Her Majesty back to the palace right now.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Was he really killed by a Silla assassin?
Are you sure it was them?
Yes.
It was the work of the Silla assassin.
Jojeong Jwapyeong made that finding after an investigation.
His investigations showed it was a Silla assassin.
Why would Silla want to suddenly kill Seong Chung hyeongnim?
That can't be.
I can't understand this.
The assassin was sent by Gim Chun Chu.
Seong Chung hyeongnim was our country's wisest minister.
Of course they would want to kill him.
Furthermore, you've seized 33 of their cities, that's why they killed your sworn brother.
They want to make you mentally confused.
Gye Baek, looks like I'll be leaving the capital city for a while.
Leave?
Where will you be going?
A place where nobody recognises me, where I can get some peace and quiet.
Seong Chung hyeongnim didn't complet his book on the art of warfare.
I will complete it for him.
Hyeongnim...
Seong Chung hyeongnim is no longer around, how can you also leave?
Gye Baek, no matter what happens, you must not waver.
No matter what happens.
After you complete the book on the art of warfare, when that time arrives,
you will definitely come back, won't you?
Hyeongnim...
Yes, I will come back then.
So, you must bear in mind, no matter what happens,
you must be strong, and guard and protect Baekje.
When did you return?
Your servant Gye Baek, will surely exterminate,
Gim Chun Chu and Silla.
I will definitely take revenge against those who killed Seong Chung hyeongnim.
-= Silla, Seorabeol =-
Our Emperor, regarding the cutting off of diplomatic ties, was really furious with Ui Ja, who killed his captives.
has agreed to annihilate Baekje.
He said he'll lend you his assistance.
Is that true?
-= Gim Chun Chu, Silla's 29th king =- Is that true?
-= Gim Chun Chu, Silla's 29th king =-
That's just great.
Really, really good.
What do you intend to do?
Our Emperor has given his orders to prepare 2 000 warships.
If 2 000 warships are made available, they can carry more than 100 000 soldiers.
Yes, right.
130 000 will travel across the sea.
Our warships will coast along the shore, and travel towards the north.
You'll pretend to attack Goguryeo, but your intention is to deceive Baekje's scouts.
That's right.
So, whereas we'll pretend to help and head towards Goguryeo, we'll then attack Baekje
here at Tanhyeon!
It's a very good strategy.
-= Tanhyeon: today's North Chungcheong Province =- And I also heard that there's something going on with the envoy from Wae country (present Japan).
Wae country and Baekje have already formed an alliance.
If this news gets to them, they will surely inform Baekje.
Until the warships start sailing, make sure the envoy of Wae country is stranded in the river.
Now that you mention it, we should do that.
Let's do it in accordance with what you say.
How many soldiers do you have?
Apart from those soldiers who're guarding the Goguryeo border, we'll mobilize all the other soldiers that we have.
That's about 50 000.
We must absolutely ensure Baekje is kept in the dark about Silla and us preparing for war against them.
I understand.
I know what to do, you don't have to worry.
Dongjang City is in a strategic position.
If we don't end the battle quickly,
Silla's back up forces will probably rush there.
I understand.
According to my investigations, the city's forward defensive position is very tight.
But, behind the city is a cliff.
If we look at it from a different angle, the defence line is very vulnerable.
Even if there's some danger, we'll have to climb up the cliff in order to attack the city.
When the city sinks into confusion, then we can attack the front and sides, that would be better.
I understand.
We'll seize the city in the shortest time possible.
Have you thought of a strategy to attack Doksan City?
Don't worry, General.
As long as this matter is successful,
Seorabeol will be surrounded by Daeha City and Doksan City.
Silla is aware of this too.
They'll put up a strong resistance.
But, we cannot miss out on this opportunity.
I understand.
Oppa...
Yes.
Are you ready with your strategies on how to attack?
This city is very important, it will be a hard battle.
Yes, it seems that way.
Although I trust your judgment, General, don't be too obsessed with revenge, and act rashly.
The late naesin jwapyeong, would also not want that.
I understand.
He'll be watching over you, General.
You must come back alive.
To Baekje, to the children, you're an indispensable person.
O Gal, Hye In.
Father.
Father is going for a short trip and will return.
The both of you must listen to your mother.
Yes.
Have you checked everything?
Yes, General.
But, things seem too quiet within the city walls.
Of course it's going to be quiet, since General Gye Baek is coming.
They must surely be scared.
They must be trembling and have hidden themselves.
General, this could be subterfuge.
Let me take a second look.
Seriously, why is it that you don't seem to understand what I'm saying?
Whether you double check or not, it makes no difference.
Rather than being defeated, it's better to flee.
It's better to take the initiative and flee.
Only by doing that, can they run far away.
You go and take a look in the surrounding area and see whether they've set up any ambush.
The two of you go and make a check on the city.
Yes.
I'm getting this strange feeling.
I'm going to take a look inside.
No, you shouldn't, it's dangerous.
Don't do that.
Didn't you say they have all fled?
Having said that, what if there are a few who are hiding somewhere and attack you.
What will we do then?
No, you can't.
Don't go.
Don't go.
Instead of all of us falling into a trap, it's better for me to suffer alone.
Hey, Dae Su.
Dae Su.
That rascal!
Look, look.
My prediction was correct.
The Silla villains, contrary to what one expects, are quick thinking.
How did they know I was coming, that they've fled?
They acted quickly, as I expected.
I acknowledge that.
This is a letter General Ui Jik has sent from Dongjang City.
What happened?
Can it be that General Ui Jik has been defeated?
Dongjang City's situation is similar to this.
The Silla army has also abandoned the city.
What?
Why did they flee?
Were they under the misconception that I'd be there too?
Those villains.
What is going on?
Looks like Silla is setting up an ambush.
What are they preparing for?
Otherwise they wouldn't do this.
Setting up an ambush?
That's difficult to believe.
Not fighting but just fleeing?
Not once has this ever happened before.
I find it very strange too.
So, we must check out Silla's situation.
Right, I've something to pass to you.
What is this?
I haven't had a look.
Someone said I must give it to you.
He gave it to me and left.
What is it?
General Gye Baek.
This is the secret document that the Queen sent here regarding Tobi City's strategy.
With her blessings,
I was able to capture Tobi City easily.
And also, the price to pay.
I helped her gain the acknowledgment of hers, and the Crown Prince's bestowment, from Tang.
Seong Chung is like you, General, a loyal subject, but what a pity!
Although we're enemies,
I'veadmiredyoufor a very long time.
If you surrender, General,
I will treat you sincerely.
How about coming over to my side?
Right, the person who killed Seong Chung, was not me, Gim Chun Chu, but your Queen.
We were ambushed by the enemy.
Our troops were almost annihilated.
Does Gim Yu Sin know our strategy?
Your servant has now obtained Tang's consent to the Queen's bestowment.
General Gye Baek's troops were attacked by Gim Yu Sin and lost Tobi City.
I really can't believe this.
The never-once-defeated Gye Baek has been defeated.
What's the cause that resulted in them being attacked?
This is really strange.
This couldn't have happened unless intelligence was leaked.
That's my thinking too.
But didn't Gye Baek say that he'd only issue the order on the day of the attack itself?
Even if there's a spy, they couldn't have brought forward the ambush.
It can't be...
General, where will you be attacking next?
We are all very curious about your next move.
It's not possible.
Why would the Queen do that?
It can't be.
We have overstepped the boundary.
The Queen's bestowment at this time is too much of a coincidence.
And hasn't Gim Chun Chu been deliberately obstructing this?
Just because of this, she betrayed the country?
It can't be...
That can't be it.
Your Majesty, your servant Gye Baek, because of this battle, has caused the loss of 8 000 troops.
How can I cleanse myself from this crime?
Children, children.
Go and stop the General quickly!
What happened?
The General has put himself behind bars, and is heading for Sabi City to be punished.
He's sitting in the horse carriage and heading out of the camp.
What are you saying?
Hurry up, go and see for yourself, quickly.
-= Episode 33 =-
General!
General!
General!
General!
General.
How can you do this?
You might as well punish us.
General, you can't do this.
Then, what are we to do?
Move away, it's not your fault.
It's all my fault.
General!
Let's leave quickly.
Yes, General.
General!
Your Majesty, your servant Gye Baek has come to confess his crimes and to ask for your punishment.
Looks like you still have a bit of conscience left in you.
Your Majesty, strategic failure is a standard matter.
Winning and losing is normal for military leaders in a war situation.
Moreover, a general who gets defeated learns from his experience.
Please spare General Gye Baek.
Your Majesty, apart from this, General Gye Baek has never lost a battle before.
If we were to punish him for just this one failure, it'll be Baekje's loss.
An undefeated general, who gets defeated, poses a problem.
The victorious Gye Baek's defeat demoralized our soldiers, and caused the morale of the Silla soldiers to rise higher.
Your Majesty, please consider the 12 empty years.
I exiled him, that 12 years was my fault.
That's right...
So that's why I agreed to everything he wanted.
I sent all the troops to the border in accordance with what he said.
I even gave him all the royal guards and the soldiers from the history department, and even consented to him meeting Yeong Gye Somun.
So this is the outcome?
What city is Tobi City?
It's a city that's just about 100 miles from Sabi City.
To lose such an important city, how can I not worry?
I appeal to all the ministers,
His Majesty's words are absolutely right.
Even if I have 10 mouths, there's nothing I can say in my own defence.
Your Majesty, your servant doesn't ask for your leniency.
I will accept any punishment you deem fit to mete out.
Your Majesty, you should execute General Gye Baek, who made you and the people lose hope, but please take his previous contributions into consideration.
I will think about this carefully, but take him into custody for the time being.
If we don't have Gye Baek, who else will protect this country?
Just one defeat and his life is at stake.
Because expectations were high, that's why this is the outcome.
His Majesty is also aware of the consequences of not having Gye Baek around.
He will not behead him because of one failure.
You have experienced it but you still don't know?
Don't you know people can change in the blink of an eye?
They can be two different people in just a day.
Matters seem to have escalated.
Even though General Gye Baek is not one of us, he's someone the country cannot do without.
His Majesty is aware of that too.
Should the enemy launch an attack, for sure His Majesty will release General Gye Baek.
Please do not worry too much.
We've completed our transaction with Gim Chun Chu, therefore there's no need to communicate with him further.
Yes.
Take the children inside.
Yes.
I've heard about the loss of Tobi City.
Is there worse news than that to come?
They've imprisoned the General.
They said His Majesty was furious, I don't know what will happen now.
He's not dead, is he?
Shouldn't we check on him?
Yes, we'll accompany you there.
No.
I fear if I go, the children and I will not be able to endure it.
I will wait here.
But...
Don't worry too much, go home and nurse your injuries.
Gye Baek, how are you?
I'm fine.
You don't have to worry.
Really, what is this, that it makes a person so dissatisfied.
Are you scolding His Majesty now?
Then, should I curse you instead?
He only reconciled with us half a month ago.
I thought things would improve from now on, really!
It was me who didn't perform to his expectations.
It was my fault.
To those who lost their loved ones, I'm a criminal.
Therefore, I can't forgive myself, so don't hate him.
Gye Baek, let me ask you something.
In my opinion, it seems like Gim Yu Sin knew your strategy beforehand.
Otherwise, it was impossible for you to have suffered a defeat.
That's a possibility, but not taking any precautions against that was my fault.
You may have a spy among your subordinates.
No, that's impossible, it's not my subordinates.
It was me who underestimated Gim Chun Chu.
That must be the reason.
Seriously...
Yes, what you say is also logical.
And also, don't be too worried.
Since Gim Yu Sin is so ferocious, His Majesty won't discard you.
Are you looking for me, Your Majesty?
Come here, my Queen.
My heart is all knotted up.
That's why I ask you to accompany me to have a drink.
You're very sad because of General Gye Baek?
Defeat to the General can be likened to good medicine.
It should be good medicine for me too.
I shouldn't have asked him to tell me the details of his offensive.
Your Majesty, are you suspecting me?
Not just you, my Queen, I suspect everyone.
Seong Chung, Heung Su and Gye Baek, I suspect everyone.
Yes, it's impossible.
No matter how much Gye Baek, Seong Chung and Heung Su hate me, they wouldn't do this.
All the more you, the country's mistress.
It could have been leaked out by a spy in Gye Baek's camp.
But to Gye Baek, who keeps his secrets so close to his heart, not being able to spot the spy in his camp, to a general, this is also a blunder.
Although that is something possible, we can also deduce that Gim Yu Sin is a very cunning person.
Gim Chun Chu.
Gim Yu Sin.
They are Baekje's biggest threat.
Gim Chun Chu.
Gim Yu Sin.
Your Majesty, how do you intend to deal with the General?
One can't do without one's hunting dog, what else can I do?
Sinyeo, Her Majesty the Queen is here.
You want to know how His Majesty will deal with the General?
What do you think will happen?
The Baekje sky will not forsake its stars.
Moreover, its most brilliant star.
So are you saying he won't kill him?
General Gye Baek is just like His Majesty's sword.
How can he defend himself against his enemy if he discards his sword?
So you don't have to worry about that, but what I worry about is...
What is it?
It's Your Majesty.
Didn't I tell you, even if you don't become the Queen,
Prince Hyo will still become the Crown Prince?
Didn't I tell you to leave a little bit of room?
What is really the problem in me becoming the Queen?
Just so you can sit in that position, and now, to enable you to hold on to that position, too much blood has been shed.
A thousand good endings, Sinyeo!
I'm begging you, Your Majesty.
You can't be the fog that obstructs the Baekje sky and its stars.
What did I do that was wrong?
That, I don't know, but Your Majesty seems to generate a lot of smog.
It's still not too late, please come to your senses.
Sinyeo, I've said it before,
I will not tolerate it a second time.
Please watch your mouth.
This is my final warning.
Please don't be obsessed with this thousand good endings.
Is that so?
-= Silla, Seorabeol =- Ui Ja, once again he's put Gye Baek in prison.
Just because of one defeat, he imprisoned him.
Isn't he overdoing it?
Isn't that a good thing for us?
I knew it would turn out like this.
Ui Ja trusted Gye Baek too much from the start, that's why he allowed him to be reinstated so quickly.
Suspicion is not something so easy to cure.
Ui Ja will never be able to rid himself of suspicion of Gye Baek his whole life.
But, why is your expression not pleased?
Aren't you happy that Gye Baek is now in prison?
Truthfully speaking, I'm not happy.
Your servant was expecting to meet Gye Baek on the battlefield again.
I want to battle again with him, face to face.
I want to defeat him honourably this time.
It's not that I don't trust you, Great General, but it's better not to fight a battle if you're not convinced you can definitely win.
Tobi City was won by luck.
Compared to that, we have much better news.
His Excellency Jang Son, on the Emperor's order, has gone to Baekje.
I'm waiting for him to come back with news of the storm in the Baekje royal court.
What storm?
If Jang Son were to do what I told him to do, the royal court in Baekje will fall into an unprecedented crisis.
Welcome, Jang Son, Sir.
It's been a long time since we last met, jwapyeong, Sir.
Her Majesty, has she been well?
Yes, it's all due to your blessings, Jang Son, Sir.
We've arranged for you to stay in the envoy residence.
You must be tired from your journey, you can meet Her Majesty tomorrow.
Hurry up and lead the way.
Rather than that, there's someone I'd prefer to meet first.
Congratulations to you on your bestowment as Queen of Baekje.
I've heard that Your Excellency was instrumental in obtaining my acknowledgment by Tang.
Let me express my gratitude once again.
What did I do?
My miniscule contribution is nothing to what Your Majesty did by yourself.
May I ask you then, what's your purpose in coming to Baekje this time?
I heard a very interesting story.
That's why I want to tell the king of Baekje about it.
What interesting story?
Can't you tell me first?
Yes, I should.
Baekje and Goguryeo have formed an alliance?
That's impossible!
Baekje sent a message to us saying they have not formed any alliance with Goguryeo.
Do you know why Tang's previous forays into Goguryeo failed?
It's because of the alliance between Goguryeo and Baekje.
What are you trying to say?
Because of the alliance, we cannot defeat Goguryeo?
Sir, even if you find this difficult to believe, thisisdefinitelyafact .
When Tang soldiers had to move across the Ryodong grassland, and when they had to cross the sea, they were exhausted even before they could fight.
Moreover, because they were travelling, they had to worry about food rations.
In such circumstances, how could they fight with ease of mind?
Are you asking for my assistance to stop the alliance between Goguryeo and Baekje once again?
Yes, no matter what, we have to get them to break it.
By doing that, we can attack Goguryeo with an easy mind.
Although this may strain our relationship with Baekje, inexchangewe getGoguryeo.
What trick has he up his sleeve?
He doesn't tell us what he wants, but insists that we support him beforehand.
He's so disrespectful!
He must be up to no good.
-= Imperial mandate: recognition of the status of the King or the Crown Prince's documents. =- He probably knows about our passing of the imperial mandate matter.
He said he'll disclose it tomorrow.
Let's wait and see.
The Queen's bestowment at this time is too much of a coincidence.
And hasn't Gim Chun Chu been deliberately obstructing this?
Just because of this, she betrayed the country?
No, he won't.
No, he won't.
What did you say?
He went and met with the Queen first?
There's something strange going on with the Queen's side.
What did I tell you?
Tang didn't give their consent so easily.
There must definitely have been dealings between them.
Let's do some investigating tomorrow.
You had better not interfere in this matter.
Why not?
Because it's the Queen's matter.
Everybody knows that your relationship with the Queen was strained over the Crown Prince matter.
You should be aware how many people she has in the palace.
I will be adversely affected if I were to investigate.
They'll say I'm slandering the Queen.
I will investigate.
But until we find the evidence, we shouldn't confront her.
Do you think you can do it?
It's dangerous no matter who does it, but I think it's better if I were to do it.
You just follow what I say.
We formed an alliance with Goguryeo?
Incorrect.
Didn't you see the document we sent to you?
Then Your Majesty should explain to me what you understand by the words alliance with Goguryeo.
Why are you not keeping to your promise?
We are also in the midst of a war.
Silla is attacking us.
In such circumstances, how can we send our troops to Goguryeo?
You are just making excuses.
Then let me show you evidence of the alliance.
Bring him in!
This is the evidence.
Your Excellency!
Who is he, that you brought him into our royal court!
He's someone we seized in Goguryeo.
He's one of Goguryeo's generals.
He's the one who arranged the meeting between Gye Baek and Yeong Gye Somun.
Tell them!
We accompanied Yeong Gye Somun when he went to meet General Gye Baek.
Did you see it with your own eyes?
Yes.
Do you still want to dispute it?
You can't say just because they met up, they have formed an alliance.
Are you trying to split hairs?
Then are you saying, Gye Baek's meeting with Yeong Gye Somun was to ask him how he wanted to kill the king?
What?
I won't say anymore,
Your Majesty should break off the alliance with Goguryeo immediately and give us a repentance note.
Otherwise... we will not let Baekje be.
Are you threatening me now?
What has Tang ever done for us?
When Silla was attacking us, you ignored us, and you've refused to acknowledge our Queen and Crown Prince's bestowment, insulting us.
This is all because Tang favours Gim Chun Chu, that Tang is treating us like this.
This is the Emperor's imperial edict!
If you don't give us the repentance note, our Emperor will revoke his consent to your Queen and Crown Prince's bestowment!
Your Majesty should accept the imperial edict immediately.
Imperial edict.
Since you dare, in my country, and in my royal court to talk about your imperial edict.
Fine.
You want to revoke it, then just do so.
I'm not the king of this country,
I am the Emperor.
Are you defying our imperial edict?
You want to defy our Emperor?
Yes, I'm defying!
It's you who's trying to control me.
What right do you have to interfere if I have an alliance with Goguryeo?
The king of Baekje not only refuses to comply with our agreement, but dares to defy us.
I've never seen such audacity!
Audacity!
You!
Whose support are you relying on that you dare to do this?
Are you seeking death?
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty!
Now you want to kill the emperor's envoy?
Do you really think that I won't dare to do it?
Your Majesty.
calm down.
Your Majesty.
calm down.
You cannot behead the envoy.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Look, even your own ministers are against it.
If they are my ministers, they should abide by my words.
Shouldn't a wise monarch listen to the advice of his ministers!
You dare to order me around.
Your Majesty!
How dare you?
Our relationship has come to an end!
Inform your emperor.
Don't send your envoys here again.
If you don't abide by my words,
I will kill each and every one who dares to step foot here.
Go and tell the Emperor immediately.
Go and get ready to leave.
Yes!
Your Excellency!
Please calm down.
His Majesty has been saddened by our loss of Tobi City, that's the reason why he behaved in that manner.
If you will just rest for a while, I'll go and persuade His Majesty.
No, you won't.
After suffering such insults, how can I remain here?
Your Excellency!
Let me apologize to you.
I will get for you the breaking of the alliance with Goguryeo and repentance note.
It's not necessary.
To treat an envoy like this, is likened to treating our Emperor in that manner.
If you want to apologize, then ask your Baekje king to confess his crime to our Emperor.
Your Excellency!
Sir, how can you do that?
Your Excellency!
Your Majesty, you can't treat Tang like that.
Tang is a powerful country.
Their military power is strong.
If you treat them like this, this is detrimental to us.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, daejwapyeong is correct.
We can't let the envoy leave like this.
Please recall him, Your Majesty.
Please recall him, Your Majesty.
Now Tang is our enemy.
Are you all not my officials?
How can you ask me to endure further, when I suffered such insults?
Your Majesty.
please calm down.
Just give him a repentance note as a matter of formality.
Whatever happens discreetly, we'll all abide by your decision.
Your Majesty.
Her Majesty is correct.
If Jang Son sir were to report this to the Emperor, they will definitely launch an attack against us.
Tang will not launch an attack against us.
Goguryeo is sitting right in the middle and will block off any attack.
Furthermore, Goguryeo has defeated Tang twice.
They will not attack us.
Your Majesty.
our circumstances and that of Goguryeo are different.
Please rethink your stand.
I've made up my mind.
Don't say anymore.
I've already said, Tang will not launch an attack against us.
Why are all of you still so worried?
All the court officials of this country are cowards.
Your Majesty.
what the ministers said was correct.
Do you think I was wrong too?
I'm not saying I don't agree with your views concerning Tang, but we have to consider the loss to all the parties.
If we break off all ties with Tang, our loss is greater.
Tang is a powerful nation.
All the neighbouring countries are compliant with Tang.
If we break off ties with Tang, we must also break ties with the other countries.
If we do that, Baekje will be isolated.
Just because you're worried that we'll be isolated, you're asking me to endure?
Like us, there are also many countries who are dissatisfied with Tang.
All we have to do is to forge an alliance with them.
The envoy has left, this is a real crisis.
His Majesty's authoritarianism has brought about a very serious problem.
Now what is our Baekje to do?
All of us have spoken, what else can we do?
It has already happened.
We have to think of a way to counter this.
Countermeasure.
So do we want to start a fight with Tang now?
Just like His Majesty said, it's not easy for Tang to attack us presently.
Since they were defeated by Goguryeo, it will take them at least 3 to 4 years before they are ready.
That period of time is enough for us to think of a countermeasure.
If we attack rashly, Goguryeo may take advantage of the situation and attack us.
We can't remain so calm.
I've been to Tang several times and I understand them the best.
Tang is not a country we can afford to offend.
If His Majesty doesn't admit to his wrongs to Tang, this matter will impede our economical prospects.
The country is facing a crisis, but the ministers still hold contrary views.
What shall we do?
Now, it's better for naedu jwapyeong and I to come up with countermeasures against possible Tang attacks.
We'll discuss this with General Gye Baek, please don't worry.
Naedu jwapyeong, do you want to inform General Gye Baek about this?
That's right.
We may have to go to war with Tang.
His Majesty will definitely not admit to his wrongs to Tang.
Yes, right.
That's why we came to consult you.
With our military might, it'll be difficult to resist Tang, am I right?
Yes, just relying on our military forces, it'll be difficult.
If Tang launches an attack, Silla will join in.
But that's not to say there's no way out of this predicament.
Yeong Gye Somun has defeated them twice.
Although our military might is not as strong as Goguryeo, we have the geographical advantage.
They won't be able to bring over a million troops in such a short time.
At the most they can bring one tenth of that.
Although their army is large, it doesn't mean we can't attack them.
Furthermore, we still have time.
Yes, you're right.
Their only available route is the sea route.
As long as we can block them, we should be fine.
It'll be very difficult for them to come through the sea route.
Even if they launch an attack, it'll be very difficult for them to do it twice.
I think we should prepare a book on the art of war.
I want to research the methods on how best to attack Tang and Silla.
Also where their military strength lies, and the strategies we need to launch an effective attack.
We should record all this, and more, in readiness to defend.
I need your help.
Can you help us?
Of course.
Are you both here to blame me and to make known your objections?
No, Your Majesty.
Although you went a bit overboard, what you said was correct.
It made us feel at ease.
What's wrong with the two of you?
Are you standing by me?
Your Majesty, although it's still difficult for Tang to launch an attack against us presently, there is that possibility.
Therefore we must prepare ourselves in readiness for that.
Be prepared, how shall we prepare?
I want to prepare a book on the art of war.
The both of you must, of course, be the editors of the book.
Very good.
If you want the book done, then you must release Gye Baek.
It's because you want me to release Gye Baek that you're backing me.
That's not it, if it's possible...
We should just leave Gye Baek in prison.
How can your Mjaesty do that?
Don't say anymore.
I can't release him just yet.
But, Your Majesty...
Your Majesty, the Queen is here.
Come in.
Have you obtained the results of your enquiries about the other countries dissatisfaction with Tang?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, about the alliance, shall we send our envoys there?
Fine.
If we form a united alliance with them, this will help us greatly.
If our Baekje were to forge an alliance with Goguryeo,
Tang won't find it easy to take us on.
But Your Majesty, our losses are still comparably large.
Your Majesty, how about giving second thoughts to breaking off relations with Tang?
I've made up my mind.
Even if we have to suffer losses, we will not have any ties with Tang.
The Tang Emperor will revoke his recognition of you and isolate Your Majesty.
He will then bestow the kingship of Baekje on someone else.
Bestow another person?
In order to oppose you, they'll simply look for a prince who has embraced Buddhism and make him king.
What are you trying to say?
Tang will definitely do that.
If that group finds they can rely on Tang's support, they'll use that strength to stir up chaos.
Here.
Here is the map of our country's topography.
Thank you so much.
How much time do you think we have to spend on this?
That...
If Gye Baek was here, we'd be able to finish up very quickly.
Or shall we establish our defence centre here?
Yes, it's easier for us to launch our attacks from here.
Tang will start their offensive from here.
What about Silla?
Silla, instead of trekking across the mountain, will do the opposite.
They'll want to see how we're defending ourselves against Tang, and use the main roads.
Baekje has broken off ties with Tang.
This is really a most rewarding gain for us.
This is Your Majesty's blessings.
I knew Ui Ja would be furious, but I didn't expect him to break off ties with Tang.
Ui Ja's tyranny has really come to this.
This is a very good opportunity.
If we make use of this opportunity wisely, we'll be able to exterminate Baekje.
I must send a message to the Baekje Queen, and get her to kill Gye Baek.
Your Majesty, must you really kill Gye Baek?
Just like Great General said, this is our opportunity.
But...
Gye Baek is the unknown factor here.
We don't know what strategy he will come up with.
We can't allow him to go to battle.
Great General.
Opportunities are few, therefore make sure you accomplish this well.
Even if we're holding their Achilles heel, do you think they'll agree to kill Gye Baek?
If they refuse to listen, then I'll have to threaten to expose them.
With that, I'm sure they'll agree.
Even if this fails, they won't be able to make the right judgment.
Your Majesty,
Gim Chun Chu's letter has come.
He's telling me to kill Gye Baek.
What shall we do, Your Majesty?
This is utter nonsense!
But if we don't kill him, they'll inform His Majesty.
Let him do it.
Do you think His Majesty will not believe my words over his?
Your Majesty, it's too dangerous.
They'll continue to make use of us.
We still need their help until Hyo ascends the throne.
Now all parties cannot just withdraw unilaterally.
I will write personally.
Tell Gim Chun Chu.
Even though we can't kill General Gye Baek, we'll consider his other requests.
But...
Tell him to assist us to restore diplomatic ties with Tang.
We can't break off ties with Tang just like that.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I've come to see wisa jwapyeong.
I'm sorry, Sir.
My master is not at home.
Is that so?
Then I will wait.
What?
F-fine.
Please come in, Sir.
Jwapyeong, Sir.
Your servant will be leaving tonight.
I'm sorry, looks like I startled you.
No, it was your servant's mistake for assuming you were my master.
It could be the clothing that caused the mistake.
But, who are you?
I'm a servant here.
Is that so?
You don't look like an ordinary servant.
Is it naesin jwapyeong?
What's the matter, that you came looking for me at my house?
I came because I need your assistance with some matter.
You can leave.
Why are you looking for me?
In fact, I came to trouble you because of General Gye Baek's matter.
Aren't you the person most favoured by Her Majesty?
Can you ask Her Majesty to convince His Majesty?
Even though I know you're close to General Gye Baek, naesin jwapyeong, this isn't a matter I think I can interfere in.
Don't take this to heart.
Is that so?
Then nothing can be done.
I'll think of something else.
I won't trouble you then.
Please come out and take a look.
What is it?
Your Majesty.
Follow me.
Gye Baek, come out.
I've readied what you wanted.
Your Majesty.
I'm giving you 3 000 soldiers.
Even though the number is small, they're all elite soldiers.
Thank you very much, Your Majesty.
One must always experience failure.
Since it's just your first defeat, you have done well.
This is your opportunity to overwhelm Gim Yu Sin.
I will be victorious, by Your Majesty's grace.
Your Majesty, your servant Gye Baek, because of this battle, has caused the loss of 8 000 troops.
How can I cleanse myself from this crime?
Please punish your servant when I arrive in Sabi City.
When your servant arrives in Sabi City, lock me up immediately.
Your servant wants to utilize the prison to launch an attack on the enemy.
Please trust your servant.
Get the soldiers ready.
The plan this time is only known to us two.
If we do it like this, your servant Gye Baek will definitely recapture Tobi City, and return the disgrace to Gim Yu Sin.
Wife.
I believe in you, General.
Thank you.
Don't worry about the children, just take care of yourself.
I wish you the best of luck.
Before day break, we must recapture Tobi City.
Let's move!
Yes!
Enemy attack!
Stop them!
Open the city gate!
Yes.
General!
General!
What is it?
General, you must leave here immediately.
I asked you what's the matter?
Gye Baek is leading the Baekje army and entering the city.
What, Gye Baek?
Didn't they say Gye Baek was in prison?
General, it's not the time to argue about this.
Most of our soldiers in the city have fallen.
Please make haste and leave now.
Enemy!
Gye Baek.
Did you think I was still in prison?
Now it'll be your turn to be in prison when you return to Seorabeol.
Yes, it's definitely you, Gye Baek.
That was a remarkable strategy.
Only by doing this are you worthy to be my opponent.
Until we meet again, Gye Baek.
Charge!
Long live Baekje!
Long live Baekje!
Long live General Gye Baek!
Long live General Gye Baek!
All the preparations have been made to despatch our envoys.
You have worked hard, daejwapyeong.
The next matter to discuss.
Your Majesty.
Your servant has something to report.
Is it about Gye Baek?
Now is the time we need Gye Baek more than ever.
Definitely...
That's my thinking too.
Then, are you going to release Gye Baek?
I've already released him.
Your Majesty, your servant has good news to report.
Go ahead and speak.
General Gye Baek has recaptured Tobi City.
And also, Gim Yu Sin has escaped.
Your Majesty, you did this deliberately so that Silla will relax, and then surprised them with a raid.
As naesin jwapyeong has said, this is Gye Baek's stratagem.
Congratulations to Your Majesty.
It's the trust between a monarch and his minister that contributed to this victory.
Your Majesty.
My sincere congratulations to Your Majesty.
Congratulations to Your Majesty.
Congratulations to Your Majesty.
Congratulations to Your Majesty.
Not only was Gye Baek released, but he has won the battle.
If I can be this happy,
I don't mind being hoodwinked everytime.
If only the rest of the things were to run smoothly like this, all would be well.
Are you talking about the Queen?
Seems like the enemy has caught hold of her weakness.
Hold on for a while.
Once I confirm it, I'll inform you.
Do you think they'll blame us for General Gye Baek's victory?
There's nothing we can do.
We didn't know about it either.
Gim Chun Chu will not believe me.
Everything will be fine.
We'll explain it to them, regarding this matter.
They were able to win against Gye Baek on the last occasion because of our help.
Go and tell Gim Chun Chu quickly.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Take him away.
Yes, Your Excellency.
Tell me, does this matter involve the Queen?
Even if you refuse to talk, it's useless because I have the evidence.
Even though it's written in vinegar and is therefore invisible, if we apply heat, the words will appear.
If you are resolute in keeping quiet,
I'll kill you right here and go and inform His Majesty.
But, if you tell me the truth, I'll spare your life.
What do you want to do?
Your Excellency!
What's the matter?
You...
Weren't you supposed to go together with him?
He was arrested.
What?
How did you handle things?
I'm sorry Your Majesty.
Who know of this matter, is it only naesin jwapyeong?
Yes, Your Majesty.
The Queen informed Silla about our Baekje's military secrets.
Silla then convinced Tang to acknowledge the Queen's bestowment.
Yes, that's the truth.
I really cannot believe this.
That the Baekje Queen can betray the country for her own selfish desires.
Watch him carefully.
Yes.
It's already so late, what's the matter, Your Excellency?
I have an urgent matter to report to His Majesty.
What?
What is wrong with you?
It's an emergency, open the door.
Yes.
Open the door!
Isn't this naesin jwapyeong?
It's already so late, where are you heading?
Do you want to see His Majesty?
Do you want to tell him that I'm a Silla spy?
Is that your admission?
I wonder.
-= Next Episode Preview =-
How can someone as smart as Your Majesty fall into this trap?
Go and beg for His Majesty's mercy.
I will do that later.
Have you thought of a plan?
Seems like Silla is in hiding.
Hey Seong Chung!
Open your eyes!
Is there anyone there?
Is there anyone there?
Is there anything I can do?
Admit you're a Silla spy.
How can such a thing like this happen?
Please adjudicate on this.
Are you telling me to kill the Queen?
I'm pleading with you to issue a wise edict.
I'll do as you say.
I asked you to come here for a moment before you leave.
There is nothing to hesitate about.
I'm asking you for a favour.

Fri Sep 23 11:51:57 2011
I'm Baekje's first prince, Ui Ja.
Look here, Il Yee.
I brought something pleasing to you.
Do you recognize him?
When the Baekje soldiers invade, I'll throw this guy to you.
I'd be thankful.
Do you want us to attack the city, with the risk of having Prince Ui Ja killed?
Launch the attack.
I am sure Prince Ui Ja wants it too.
Even if the Prince is there, we have to attack.
Since you're captured here, it'll be difficult for them to go forward with their attack plan.
Prince Ui Ja said to go ahead with the attack.
I sent them word to attack, so we must create chaos in the city.
Open the front gate!
Il Yee, we'll definitely meet again.
What about Ui Ja?
Did you not find him?
Ui Ja.
He's here.
Episode 11
Your Majesty!
I heard you had a big success.
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm fine.
I've heard you were very brave, you even killed two Shilla generals.
What an amazing exploit!
I am really sorry I cannot present you the heads of the two generals.
It's alright, it was your first battle.
That accomplishment is more than sufficient.
All this, was possible only with Your Majesty's grace.
Is that right?
I heard that the campaign was under Her Majesty the Queen's command.
Compared to te Princes' exploits, your actions were by far greater.
Especially that Prince Ui Ja was in the city, when the attack was launched.
How terrible!
Thank you for praising me, the truth is I don't turn my back on accepting responsibilities.
I trusted that Ui Ja could keep himself safe.
Thank you.
You're the one who contributed the most to this victory, Gye Baek.
Tell me what you want as a reward.
I'll inform the king when we return to the capital.
He'll be very happy to see you.
I don't want to receive a reward or to see the king.
I'm not going to the capital.
What do you mean you're not going?
You have to come with us.
Your life is changed now.
You are exactly how Mu Jin hoped you would be.
Your Highness, do you think I have forgiven you?
Please do not misunderstand me.
Maybe all those words are nothing but lies.
I don't want to hear anything.
Only Ahgasshi is to blame for this.
I understand your heart and I'd like to be able to do something.
You don't have to do anything.
What was done cannot be undone.
Where will you go?
Why are you like this?
Even if you reject the Prince's offer, what is it that you have against me?
I owe you nothing.
Take me in your heart again.
So when...
long ago.
MayI askyouaquestion?
MayI keepyouinmyheart ?
You were gone, but I always hoped you would return.
Keepitalwaysaroundyour neck ,itwillhelpkeepyou alert.
Who told you to give it back to me?
All I want is to be in your heart again.
I don't know how to do it anymore.
Just come back with me.
What are you thinking about?
Nothing in particular.
Is it that Gye Baek comes along because I asked him to?
No, it is not like this.
Thanks to you Gye Baek returns with us, which is a good thing.
I'm leaving now.
Your Majesty.
Congratulations for taking Gajamseong City.
Congratulations, Your Majesty.
Thank you.
Who really deserves being congratulated is Her Majesty, the Queen.
Your Majesty.
You led the army against the enemies as a true hero!
Congratulations!
Congratulations!
It is really you.
Prince Ui Ja's merit has nothing to do with your sense of humor.
Her Majesty the Queen saved me from that city where I was trapped and where I almost died.
My wife's father wants to thank you for bringing me back safe.
Please accept his gratitude.
Your Majesty.
All nobles swore to follow you and my father-in-law does it too.
Am I right, Father-in-law?
Yes.
Thanks to Her Majesty the Queen, my daughter lives in peace now.
Our family will never forget the Queen's grace.
I shall personally take care of your family's welfare.
Yes, Your Majesty.
On such a happy day, dance is a must!
Your Majesty, I wish you a long and happy life.
Have you also watched their home?
Yes.
He often meets with nobles.
How many are they?
There are around two hundred.
Be careful and watch them all closely.
Yes.
I wonder what your feelings are, now that you are back.
So you're still not talking, Lonely Wolf.
Oh, no, you are Gye Baek...
Are you surprised that I know your name?
Ahgasshi called your name.
She is so beautiful...
Be careful.
Beautiful flowers might be poisonous.
Once you are poisoned, it's difficult to heal...
Don't ever talk like that!
I guess you're already poisoned...!
Sorry, sorry..
Don't be so aggressive on such a beautiful day...
My name is Seon Chung.
Usually I don't like hostile people.
If you ever need help, come look for me.
I shall help you once.
We shall never meet again.
Never say never.
I'm not doing it because of you.
I am really sorry for your people who suffered so much in Gajamseong and who helped us.
The world we live in is unfair, that's the truth.
And, as we can see, those who wanted to live are dead now while those who wanted to die are still alive.
Ahgasshi, no celebration party?
I'd like to eat from that fine food...
You may go by yourself.
No, I shall not go without Ahgasshi.
Then go where the former prisoners are having a party.
I am not a prisoner!
Oh, yes!
Is Gye Baek there too?
Yes...
Gye Baek... (more respectfully)
He must feel lonely, so go talk to him.
I said I wanted to eat, not to talk!
Now, that we are home, you could eat anything you want.
Come on, hurry there!
But...
Gye Baek was so thin when he was young, he looked rather a good for nothing guy...
Now he is somewhat different... more appealing...
How should I put it?
He's withdrawn... that indescriptible sense of aloofness...
He changed so much!
Don't you think?
Who are you?
You cannot enter this place.
Now go away!
Eat slowly.
You're going to get indigestion.
Father, you should eat, too.
All right.
Take a bite, take a bite!
Isn't it delicious?
It is delicious.
I'm grateful that you grew up so well.
You shouldn't live like I did.
You shouldn't wield a sword.
You shouldn't fight and you shouldn't cause heartache to your family.
You should quietly do some farming.
If you have a big crop, you shouldn't store the leftovers.
You should give it away.
Thank you.
You served wine to this lacking father for a long time.
I told you to go away!
Father...
He says he'll kill mother and brother.
Please save them, Father.
It looks like you should listen to your son.
It seems like the ending will be uninteresting.
How did it happen, that you accompanied Ui Ja in that foolish expedition into the city?
You almost got yourself killed.
It was an accident.
I had to know what he intended to do... maybe he had a conspiracy going on...
I had to watch him closely.
That was what I thought at that time.
You did very well.
You see how dangerous Ui Ja is.
In order to conquer the city, he put himself in a very dangerous spot.
But he was not killed in the process, as expected.
In the end, Ui Ja became a meritorius subject.
In fact, it was not Ui Ja who played the most important part in conquering the city, but the prisoners who fought from inside the city creating chaos.
So, it is not Ui Ja who deserves a reward, but those former prisoners.
I'll take care of this matter.
They will be given a place to stay and rice to eat.
People will admire and respect you for your grace, Your Majesty.
There is also the problem of the war record for each Prince.
I wonder to which Prince the title promised by the king will go.
Could it be Ui Ja the chosen one?
Ui Ja must not be given the title.
What do you mean?
Your Majesty does not want this to happen.
All ministers, the nobles, are against it.
I am also against it.
You are right.
It would make everybody unhappy and angry.
In this case, we should solve the problem.
But How?
Tell me, I am curious to know what you have in mind.
Court Ministers should discuss if Ui Ja can be given power.
Given the fact that he acted like an adventurer, his faults during the war should be emphasized.
You are the best counselor ever.
Your grace is unparalled, Your Majesty.
But... there is something else too.
What is it?
Be patient, you will see.
Don't you trust me?
All the fun is gone, if you know beforehand.
Don't you think so?
I understand what you mean.
I shall endure the wait, to laugh more afterwards.
There is also the problem of my father taking you as his daughter.
As I took part in Gajamseong City's war, I had no time to think it over.
Please allow me some more time.
I hope you can give me your answer soon.
Why are you here?
Aghasshi, why are you here?
!
Quickly, go away from here!
What happens here?
Why did you meet the Queen?
I'll tell you everything later.
No, I want to know now.
You know the queen is my enemy.
Ui Ja also said that the Queen is unjust.
So, what is your relationship with the Queen?
It is dangerous to stay here.
Tell me.
I am not afraid to die.
You can do what you want.
You can leave me, if that's what you want.
Ui Ja seems stronger now.
I don't understand what happened.
Everything seems different, since Gajamseong was taken.
Several months passed with our army trying to conquer the city.
And then, all of a sudden, the city is taken.
Really, really, really...
All those prisoners helped Ui Ja.
Oh, so that is the explanation!
So, Ui Ja had not been so important, after all.
Where does this strength come from then?
Why give Ui Ja so much credit?
Listen to me, Minister.
Ministers of the Court will decide upon this matter.
After the enthusiasm fades away, we have to judge with a clear mind.
I was not there, so please tell me everything.
While Ui Ja was a Shilla prisoner, General Choong lead the attack.
So that is the truth!
Her Majesty the Queen had to make a bold decision and order the attack.
So, Prince Ui ja, due to his reckless action, nearly destroyed our chances.
So it was!
You're right, Prime Minister.
This is what really happened.
The Queen almost humiliated you, in public.
Her son's bride was stolen.
It must be hard to digest such an event.
I can understand her feelings.
Now everything will go smoothly.
Nobody can go against it.
But how is it possible?
Oh, I understand now...
It means we have the means to stop the Queen's and the nobles' opposition.
You are right.
All we have to do now is to get things started.
I am sure they will try to oppose our initiative.
But Ui Ja is now in the best position ever.
So, you should try to convince the members of the nobility.
Why are you only laughing?
Your majesty, you're very naive.
What do you mean?
Please, think about it.
The bride that was promised to Prince Gyo Gi was taken by Prince Ui Ja.
At the banquet, as you saw, the Queen planted the seeds of her next move.
And it is not all about Prince Ui Ja, but it will affect our entire family.
Also, all the nobles who trust me, what are they to do?
Does that mean you're going to support Gyo Gi instead of your son-in-law?
I'm not going to support any of the Princes.
I'll keep a distance.
How can you of all people behave like this?
I'm sorry, your majesty.
I'm doing my best to survive.
Does this mean that even a person like you has become like this?
How is it possible?
Do you also fear this bunch of nobles?
Consider the position of a minister!
You are an intelligent person, a wise man.
I need someone like you.
Your majesty!
I want you to win this political struggle.
Does that mean you'll side with the opposition first and then later come to my side?
You seem to be playing with me.
Are you telling me that I've misjudged you?
I thought you were with us, once you had accepted Ui Ja as son-in-law.
Obviously, I was wrong.
Your majesty.
Do you really think Prince Ui Ja is a fool and wants to live life of difficulty and punishment?
By hiding, enduring and surviving can one realize a big goal.
It is the same for me.
What kind of father would marry off his daughter and wish for his son-in-law to die?
For now, we have to endure the Queen's domination.
That way we can win this battle.
Dae Ja Pyong.
Your presence was expected.
Where is he?
Perhaps.
I wonder if he fell into this wine bottle.
Though a bit late, thank you.
Thanks to your strategy, we won and I'm still alive.
Oh!
What strategy!
What Your Highness did is more important than my strategy!
What does that mean?
What did I do so great?
If I were to say it simply, you behaving like a fool when you were young, escaping notice by the opposition's leader.
This is what I call a decisive strategy.
You did what you had to do, but that is a heart-breaking thought.
Stop there.
Speak.
What is that heart-breaking thought?
You won't like it.
Must you hear it?
I need to hear it.
So that I can decide whether to kill you or not.
I barely escaped from Gajamseong City...
Then I must tell you.
That strategy that enabled you to survive, but broke your heart...
You killed General Mu Jin directly in order to survive.
Who are you?
I am just a loyal person.
Where did you hear this?
Why do you ask that?
Upon a correct evaluation of the facts, even a one year old child can get to the truth.
Is it really your thought?
It is mine.
What do you think of the Queen's family?
It is lead by a woman.
Then what do you think of me?
I've never thought about it.
Tell me what you haven't thought about.
I think it is all about getting revenge.
Under your appearance there is a sleeping dragon.
A dragon aiming to the throne.
People like me don't even dream about such things.
Song Choon, will you become my follower?
I am a capable man, but this is not easy.
My friends will laugh at me.
But I shall reflect upon your demand.
Now, I must go drink wine that I've been unable to drink in over a year.
There, there, there.
Oh, how nice!
Oppa.
Of course, of course.
-----empty-----
Sabi's liquor is the best.
This is delicious!
You said you'd never return to Sabi.
Why did you change your mind?
Yul Bae.
I won't say this again.
Don't ask me such deep and profound questions.
Was that such a difficult question?
Yul Bae.
Do you know what the most unattainable thing in this world is?
What is it?
A person's heart.
A person could get drunk and lose control of his body.
But you cannot lose control of your heart.
So, is a person't heart a profound thing or not?
It's profound.
That's right.
Don't ask a question like that again.
Now, give me more food.
Yes.
Okay.
We've returned.
What happened?
We asked people around, in the streets, to find out what's new.
Our business is in someone else's hands and many people died!
I could go crazy.
You're telling me someone took over my position while I was away?
And that all those I had business relations with, have disappeared?
So shameful...
How is it possible!
Hard working people are disregarded!
What does he do?
The rumor is that he's Baekjean but he came from Tang country.
So, what is he doing?
It seems he came just recently here.
He is in charge of our previous location.
What is his name?
We don't know his name but he goes by Bul Yeo.
Bul yeo?
(throw away)
What does he throw away?
He kills people, like lives are trash and that's why they call him that.
Oppa.
I'm scared.
That guy.
What a scary nickname...
Kids.
Don't sweat it.
If we have to fight a nickname, don't forget my nickname is killer!
Yes, the killer, the killer!
Now, drink!
We took care of it.
It's the head you wanted.
Do you want to verify?
Take a look.
Yes, it is his head.
I feel relieved now.
In that case, pay and leave.
One of my men died while completing this job.
You should pay for his life.
Why should I do that?
It is my decision.
Pay.
This isn't our first transaction.
Throw him away.
Yes.
You are confident, aren't you?
I've lived my life by my sword.
Please, don't worry.
I don't want to be taken by surprise.
Don't worry, this is where we shall have a life!
Okay, okay.
There won't be too many people left who remember the Mu Jin incident.
We're establishing our business again.
Are you the ones who wanted to see me?
Oh, you've come.
Are you the one who is called Bul Yeo?
Life is divided between those in the middle an the low ones.
Of course, you are an important person.
Whose head do you want?
Yours.
I need your neck.
Who are you?
I am the original owner of this place.
I am leader Dok Gae.
You have to win the fight.
Don't you remember me?
Who are you?
We have to decide which Prince deserves the title.
Yes.
The Minister of Protocol will lead the meeting.
-----empty-----
Following the unanimous decision...
This is the result of your discussions?
That is right.
It could have been said that the most meritorious was
Prince Ui Ja.
But, because of his insubordination, he was captured by the Shilla and could have caused great danger to our troops.
If it weren't for the queen's decision, the attack of the city could have been jeopardized.
And the city would have remained Shilla territory.
He is right.
Without the good outcome, the merits of Prince Ui Ja would not have been mentioned.
That is true.
Prince Ui Ja did nothing but endanger the royal family and our country.
I wonder how long is he going to do this.
I think so, too.
Prince Ui Ja is obviously lacking judgement and he cannot handle power.
Do you think so, too, Great General?
No, I have a different opinion.
I can understand what the Ministers had to say against Prince Ui Ja.
He made some mistakes, but he cannot be blamed for everything.
They are trying to diminish Prince Ui Ja's great contribution.
Let me ask one question, Great General.
If the Queen had not ordered the attack, with the risk of losing Prince Ui Ja, weren't you the one who opposed the attack?
You had the intention to save the Prince's life, didn't you?
Your majesty.
This is the truth.
Therefore, if we are to judge which of the Princes had more merit in this war,
Prince Gyo Gi won.
Your majesty, he is right.
Because of my irrational behaviour,
I endangered our chance for victory in that battle.
So, I consider Gyo Gi as making a bigger contribution to the battle.
Your majesty.
The title should go to Prince Gyo Gi.
Do that.
Thank you for your greatness, Your Majesty!
Investment of Prince Gyo Gi can be done now.
You, guy!
That person is Prince Ui Ja.
The person behind you is Prince Gyo Gi.
Please, take this.
My arms are starting to hurt.
That guy is crazy.
You, guy.
What kind of mess up is this?
Your Majesty.
May I say something?
You, guy.
This isn't a place for a person like you to be involved.
Can you not withdraw right now?
Oh, really.
Why is your voice so loud?
You may speak.
Ministers!
Though I am but a minor official,
I have a conscience too.
The one who deserves the title is, in my opinion, the one standing there.
Try to listen carefully and to understand.
In a siege, the most important thing is to reduce the losses.
This is the corect way of leading the battle.
I'll put my mere life on the line.
Prince Ui Ja caused chaos in the city, thus helping the attack.
He even successfully opened the city gates.
By doing so, he influenced the outcome of the battle.
Without Prince Ui Ja's action, the attack might have failed.
Or, we might have been confronted with a greater loss.
But, thaks to the efforts of the prisoners, lead by Prince Ui Ja, the Shilla soldiers could not fight at their fullest potential so, in the end, they had to run away.
That's what I think.
Yes, but by letting himself be caught, he jeopardized the attack.
In a war, there is always the possibilty of being caught.
For soldiers it is not easy, when they are caught.
The fact that the Prince went there to save them, was extremely important for them... he chose to put his life on the line to save them.
This action raised their morale and made them fight like enraged lions.
It is the most important action.
Also, let's consider what would have happened if Prince Ui Ja had died.
Had he died, would the morale of the soldiers have been low?
No, that would not be the outcome!
This is something that we, the Baekje soldiers, know very well.
If the prince dies, then we, the Baekje soldiers, we would be moved by the Prince's sacrifice.
We would have fought with even more determination.
An honorable man chose to go to the most dangerous place.
The patriotism of the soldiers was aroused.
Their morale was lifted.
Who else did such a thing?
That's why I consider Prince Ui Ja as the winner.
You are a straightforward talker, aren't you?
I don't think I like being an official...
That... that...
Your Majesty.
Our decision was given in good faith.
It is truly embarassing.
None of that officer's words were wrong.
I also find unjust the decision of the ministers.
Prince Ui Ja should be given the title.
Queen!
Mother!
If we do not reward him now...
Who will fight for this country?
How can you do this?
Not anyone else but you, my mother.
I am your own son, not Ui Ja.
Then.
Do you really think that your contribution was greater than Ui Ja's?
It seems to me you need him more than you need me.
You have no conscience.
Mother.
You are no better.
Even if your merit were greater, you could not take his power away.
Why are you doing this?
Do you really hate the thought of me becoming the Crown Prince?
This is so that you will become Crown Prince and ascend to the throne.
But you still have a long way to go.
You have to separate yourself from your mother's and grandfather's support and you have to become stronger, and stand on your own two feet.
You're really too much.
How can you do this to me?
What are you thinking?
That official was the first step.
Are you really thinking of giving the throne to Ui Ja?
Cho Han is not the crown prince position.
But, everybody was upset with the decision.
That is why I had this attitude.
Let's see what the others will do.
That's right.
Ui Ja's supporters will become prominent.
Ui Ja will believe in this support and come after us.
Then he will have to face some uncomfortable situations.
All those supporting Ui Ja will face consequences.
A very good strategy.
Also, who was that officer?
I inquired.
I just know his name is Hong Soo.
He is a very proud person.
He deserves our attention, I think.
Hong Soo...
I'd like to meet him.
Please, call for him.
They say he already left the palace.
Please, find him.
I understand.
Gyo Gi.
What is it?
It turned out regrettable.
Regrettable?
But your contribution was definitely greater.
No, not at all.
I was just lucky to survive.
Such a crazy action...
You, guy.
Why aren't you giving it to him?
Pardon?
Oh, yes.
What is this?
Think about it.
This is the most important title...
It is not fit for me.
If I wear it, the Royal Family will be ridiculed.
I...
Gyo Gi, am I a beggar?
What does that mean?
I'm being sincere.
You're the one who should be Cho Han.
You, guy.
What are you doing?
Queen.
I don't want to be Cho Han.
He gave up too easily the Cho Han title.
Moreover, doesn't he disrupt His Majesty's plans?
Is he really stupid, or does he want to fool us?
I don't understand his actions.
We had several discussions on this matter.
This Ui Ja knows very well what he wants.
We tried so many times to get rid of him.
He always slipped through our fingers.
His Majesty was always defended by
Mu Jin.
He had him by His side.
I wish I had someone like him by my side.
I wonder who is secretly helping Ui Ja.
He is so lucky, I'd like to catch him on an unlucky day.
He acted as if he knew our plan.
We have to solve the problem differently.
What do you think, Your Majesty?
Is anyone outside?
Did you call for me?
Bring... to me.
Do you mean the priestess?
She must be hiding, praying.
Find her.
Be sure to bring her here.
Yes, your majesty.
But...
Didn't the king chase her out himself?
Perhaps are you going to bring her back to the temple?
If she will follow my plans then,
I will think about it.
You are here.
It's been a long time.
I am glad to meet you.
I have to go back to the mountain shortly.
Did that child grow up well?
Yes.
She matured better than the average person.
Your prophecy was correct.
Is that so?
I would like to see her.
But there is something worrisome.
What is it?
I still wonder whether she chose Ui Ja or is she still looking out for exacting revenge.
Because of Ui Ja and his need to exact revenge, many problems will arise.
That's right.
If he becomes king...
There may be a bloody power struggle in this country.
It won't be that way.
There is another person who will stop the bloodshed.
Another person?
Who is that person?
He is already next to her.
He will make Ui Ja open his eyes and affect his heart.
Also, that person will help Ui Ja gather people around him.
She's not going to work with Ui Ja?
That child, will be a true hero.
They said to come inside.
Oh, this strong, beastly scent.
Nice.
Very nice.
These are my father and mother.
But they don't recognize my face.
Father passed away before I was 1 year old.
Mother passed away shortly after my 10th year.
Do you remember what I said that night?
Is this person, General Mu Jin?
Do you know my father?
I know him.
He always faithfully served Baekje.
People who used to know the General say there was none as loyal as him.
I do remember.
That known person who I was referring to was my father.
Letmego !
Let me go, you people!
What did I do wrong?
Let go!
Madame!
Do you believe now?
Like General Mu Jin, he was a faithful servant, a loyal subject of Baekje.
You were not the only one to have suffered injustice.
Keeping close to the enemies means finding out their soft spot.
So, I got close to the Queen, and I became her best friend.
That's the only way to kill them at any time.
This is what I had to tell you.
But, that's too dangerous.
If by chance you're found out, your life...
You said you didn't care if you lived or if you died.
It's the same for me, too.
If I can avenge the unfair death of my father, it doesn't matter to me.
The thought of revenge has given me a reason to live.
There is a place you need to accompany me to.
Mister!
Look who's here!
It's been a long time.
I was going to burn some incense...
But it seems I don't have to, after all.
Ahjussi.
What do you mean 'ahjussi'?
This is the first time seeing you.
Who are you?
Don't you recognize me?
I don't know.
How would I know you?
Ah ha...
You're here to collect that debt!
I said I'd repay him in the spring.
Why seek me out?
I have guests, too.
Get going.
I'm Gye Baek.
What Gye Bark?
I said I would pay when spring comes!
What did you just say?
I'm Gae Baek.
I'm the Gae Baek that used to deliver wine to you and my father.
That doesn't make sense.
Gye Baek died.
I definitely heard that he died.
I also thought I was going to die.
Are you really that mischievous Gye Baek?
I heard that you had died.
You, child.
You survived.
You survived.
You survived, you guy.
That night, hyungnim told me to put this sword in the fire but,
I could not do that.
It wasn't because I couldn't make something else, but if I melted this sword down, there would be nothing left to remember hyungnim by.
How should I live now, father?
Sit down for a minute.
Gye Baek, for the time being, you should stay with me.
Miss Eun Go said you can live with her but, living here will be more comfortable for you.
Please, do what's comfortable for you.
Have you heard anything about Moon Goon?
I did hear gossip once about him but, whether he's alive or dead,
I hear nothing now.
What do you plan on doing?
I don't really know.
Get revenge.
You're the owner of that sword now.
If there's anything you need,
I'll do everything to help you.
If you need more swords, I'm make them.
If you tell me to make bows, then I will.
What are you saying now?
Gae Baek has just come back from the brink of death.
How can you talk about revenge?
I should ask you, ahgassi.
What are you saying?
When parents die a violent and unjust death,
Of course, the child should avenge the death of his parent.
If not, why did you bring him here?
You should speak.
Are you not going to avenge hyungnim?
Revenge isn't Gye Baek's duty.
Your Highness.
You, guy.
That's okay.
You should no longer wield a sword.
Neither Eun Go or I want you to wield a sword any longer.
Your Highness!
More than that, that is what General Mu Jin wanted.
That was your father's final wish.
Revenge is my duty.
Thank you for watching with us!

Episode 12
I didn't suggest to come to the capital in order to get revenge.
You must have had a difficult time living to this point.
You should live comfortably from now on.
That's why I asked you to come with us.
How can I live comfortably?
My life cannot take a smooth path.
Even though you and the prince tell me to live comfortably,
I cannot live comfortably.
I cannot endure it.
General Mu Jin and also your late mother
both would want you to not go down the path of revenge.
Then why are you and the prince going down that dangerous path?
Your parents and the late Queen Seon Hwa mean as much to you and the prince as my father does to me.
Of course, someone has to get revenge.
The prince and I will do that.
We're going to get revenge even for your life.
So you don't need to get involved.
Are you telling me to watch from behind your back?
I can't do that.
Also, who is going to get release for my grudge?
I'll do it.
I can end it with this sword.
You're very naive.
Do you think it's that simple?
The prince and I have prepared for over 10 years.
We don't know how much longer we'll need.
If it were to be like this, it would have been better if we had left you where you were.
Is that so?
I will leave.
My feelings for you my precious feelings for you,
I'll return to you.
Okay, did you visit your mother?
Yes.
Also, thank you for taking such good care of her, ahjussi.
It wasn't me.
It was Miss Eun Go who did it.
Have you made a decision?
I still don't know.
Of course, your feelings are complicated.
But then can you sleep peacefully when you have thoughts for revenge and grudges?
Please send for Prince Ui Ja.
He refused the Cheohangwan position, thus becoming His Majesty's representative.
It is similar to the Crown Prince's position.
Don't you think he is really mad?
Father, I don't feel comfortable with the action Prince Ui Ja had taken...
After the victory at Gajamseong Ui Ja was given this position that he rejected.
I don't know what to think about him.
But... why doesn't he want the position of Choehangwan?
Considering all the rumors about the Prince fooling around with numerous women?
I really like it.
I am satisfied that he is considered a fool whose only interest is to chase women.
What does that mean?
Does that mean you agree to my marriage with the Prince?
No, how could I send my precious daughter to such an absurd fellow?
Then what do you mean by 'I like it'?
Tae Hyun, listen closely.
You will definitely become queen.
Do you mean Ui Ja will ascend to the throne?
It will definitely turn out like that.
But before that happens, you can't reveal this.
You should continue to think of him as an absurd prince.
This is so embarassing.
I've never seen you guys win in a sword fight.
Oh, really...
Also, who is that guy?
He doesn't kill us even though he seems like he's going to.
He just beats us up.
So, please remember quickly.
He says he's going to beat us until you remember.
Hey, there are many guys who are after me.
If all those guys were to line up, the line would be miles long.
How can I remember them all?
Dae Soo, do you really not recognize that guy?
I don't know.
I don't remember at all.
You can't win in a sword fight and you have a bad brain.
You, really...
Can you still not remember?
Long ago, my memory used to be really good.
But after taking opiates, my memory isn't that good any more.
I can't even remember if I had washed myself or not.
I realize I haven't washed myself only after checking out...
Ah, wait!
I think I may be able to remember but,
I'm sorry, can you give me a little hint?
Fine.
If you can't remember after the hint, then you'll be beaten until you die.
Wi Je Group.
Wi Je Group?
!
I did business with Wi Je Group only once.
It was due to the Mu Jin fellow.
I captured Mu Jin's eldest son.
At that time, Mu Jin died and his wife died cleanly.
Gye Baek?
Gye Baek was his son.
I heard he was captured and he died, too.
I can't remember if Mu Jin had one or two sons.
Was not the one working at the tavern, Moon Geun Hyung-nim?
The tavern?
Right!
Right!
The idiot who asked me why I needed his father!
Oh, you grew up well.
So well matured.
I'm glad to see you.
Hyungnim, I'm Yeong Soo.
Do you recognize me?
I was fat back then but I've become this skinny since I suffered so much.
I know you.
How could I forget your faces?
You couldn't forget, of course.
The incident with your parents was really unfortunate but it wasn't my fault.
I was forced to capture you guys, so don't misunderstand.
No, that's not right.
We killed your parents.
Yup, we killed them.
What?
You're crazy!
Hyungnim!
Go ahead and kill us.
Master Dok Gae, we are real men.
Why try to escape?
It would be a shame to live like that.
Let's end this.
Your subordinates are better than you.
Now that you recognize me, you should die.
Why wave that knife at me?
Rather than me, you should capture the guys who actually killed your parents.
Wi Ja Group.
I know you cannot contact the Wi Ja Group.
You're wrong, I can contact them.
There is a way.
I've thought about it.
As you said, I won't become involved in the revenge.
That's a good decision, a very good decision.
General Mu Jin will be happy, too.
Don't worry, I'll carry out the revenge.
Please, be sure to do that.
Have you decided how you'll live?
What can I do for you?
As father wished, I'll leave the capital.
How long will you be away?
I won't return.
Will you tell me where you'll go?
Does that mean this is our final meeting?
I'm sad.
Am I still your younger brother?
Of course.
Before you were born, you were my younger brother.
You're still my younger brother now.
No matter what happens?
No matter what happens.
I think I've had many misunderstandings about you.
May I spend one night with you?
That would be great.
That would be my request to you.
Here is very basic.
That doesn't matter.
As long as we're together, the place doesn't matter.
Come back here later at night.
Bring Gye Baek to the palace.
Yes.
See you again.
I understand.
Why is the prince taking the sword?
Are you perhaps thinking of not going ahead with the revenge as the prince suggested?
Ahjussi.
I'm hungry.
Cook some food, please.
You, guy.
Come in.
What brings you here?
What to do with this crap.
Because of you, I had to endure such shame.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know Ui Ja would survive the poisoning.
Such idiots.
Please, calm down, Prince.
I heard Ui Ja refused the Cheonhangwan position, so you, Your Highness, were bestowed this position.
Don't you understand this is even worse?
Don't you understand?
I'm sorry.
Kill Ui Ja immediately.
I never received such a command from the queen.
My command is mother's command.
I, only follow the queen's orders.
You, guy.
If it's not the queen's command, I cannot even follow the Tae Ja Peong's orders.
I'm Gyo Gi, successor to the throne.
Do you want to die?
I'll ask you again.
Will you follow my command or will you die?
We, the Wi Ja Group, are not afraid of death.
I only follow the leader's commands.
The queen is our leader.
My body is not mine only.
Do you remember?
How could I forget?
Prepare a nice table.
Yes.
Gye Baek.
Youhavebecomesothin ...
Father!
Don'teverleavemealoneanddon'ttrytofindyourdeath!
Okay.
I won't leave you again.
I prepared everything we need.
Let's go.
Sit down for a minute.
I have to hear an explanation today.
Is it about me, becoming your father's adopted daughter?
Perhaps you dislike me?
How could that be?
Then do you dislike my family?
Your family is the best in Baekje, how could I dislike your family?
Then what is it?
Why did you refuse?
Hurry and speak.
I decided long ago.
When you told me you wanted me to become your adopted sister, I was truly happy.
Is that true?
But.. why didn't you tell me?
Why let me worry for so long?
I am the one who is not worth such an honor.
Considering family background, education, skills, I am the one with no merits.
I am not good enough to be the Prime Minister's daughter and the Queen's sister.
No matter how much I thought about it, this isn't right.
I could only bring shame to Your Majesty and to Your Majesty's family.
Please, retract your offer.
Don't say that.
You are more beautiful and smarter than any other noble girl.
Don't worry about anything.
Enter our household.
If you ever again say such nonsense, I won't see you again.
Queen.
I, your younger sister, Tae Ja Peong's daughter, will live a good life, unembarrassed.
Good.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Since we're like this, it feels like we've really become family.
Gye Baek.
I wish you wouldn't leave.
If I don't leave, my anger will not go away.
Eun Go will be the saddest.
Don't go.
If you do go, tell us where you're going so that we may visit.
If you don't do that, I don't think I can endure it.
I'll think about it.
Really?
You should sleep.
It's difficult to go to sleep now.
After mother died, I've never slept with another person.
Because I trusted no one.
But since you're here, I'm so happy.
It's been a very long time but I think I can sleep now.
Who are you?
Why did you stop me?
I could have killed our enemy.
Why did you stop me!
When you said you would leave, that was what you intended to do, didn't you?
You and the prince tell me not to get revenge.
What other plan is there?
If I put my mind to it, I can stab the queen at any time.
But that's not the end of the revenge.
Then?
What is the end?
As long as Sa Taek family and all other noble families are not destroyed, even if we kill the Queen, another Sa Taek family can rise anytime.
You almost destroyed what we tried to build over those long years.
Whether the Sa Taek family is revived or not, what has that to do with our vengeance?
All I want is to kill my enemies.
I know you saw what happened that day at the South Gate.
You know that General Mu Jin saw how your mother was killed.
But he chose not to kill Sa Taek Bi, who was right in front of him.
That is enough.
Why do you think he didn't do it?
It was not because he didn't want to kill the Queen in order to avenge your mother's death.
But he wanted to eliminate all wrongdoings in our country - that was his reason.
How can you ignore all this?
Even I, Eun Go, I know what it was all about.
Stop.
Please stop.
Eung Go.
Eun Go.
Gye Baek...
You are here?
You used me... you used me to kill the Queen, didn't you?
Do you really believe I consider you my hyung-nim?
I'm all right with this, but your determination in seeking the death is unforgivable.
Didn't we agree that I was to fulfill our avenging plans?
As long as we kill them, why should it be your responsability or mine?
Please that is enough.
Gye Baek, listen to me carefully.
In order to get revenge, I've lived close to the Sa Taeks as a dead person.
I carefully planned and I carried out all the plans.
Finally, the day has come.
Soon, I'll be Sa Taek Bi's sister.
I'll be the adopted daughter of Sa Taek Jeok Deok.
What do you mean?
Adopted daughter...?
Isn't it enough that you are their running dog (servant) now you have to enter that family?
By becoming Sa Taek Jeok Deok's daughter and the Queen's sister, nobody would dare disregard me.
I shall destroy them one by one, as soon as I become one of them.
So, don't you dare do something like this again.
Still, I don't know if such a plan can be successful.
I think the same.
No matter what, you'll have to call Jeok Deok "father" and the Queen "sister".
You are wrong.
Think about it again.
Why do you think I'm doing it?
I shall become more ruthless.
It is what Your Highness does, pretending to be just a lecherous imbecile.
Haven't you survived enduring the life of an animal, just to be able to get revenge?
That is why...
I can call Jeok Deok father and the Queen sister.
So, I'll call them father and sister as many times as it takes, to achieve my goal.
Ahgasshi, why do you have to do something that brings you so much suffering?
If they ask you to marry Prince Gyo Gi... would you do it?
I'll do it.
Whatever I have to, I'll do it.
Eun Go...
Why can't I do it?
Even if they ask me... not only to marry Gyo Gi, but even to become Jeok Deok's concubine...
I'll do it.
You want me to take Eun Go as my adopted daughter?
Yes.
Don't you like the idea?
I think she is a good child.
Your Majesty has been close to her for a long time, so I guess we can trust her.
So then what?
Something bothers me, so I'm not entirely comfortable with this idea.
What exactly is it that makes you feel uncomfortable?
She resembles Your Majesty too much.
I don't know if this is good or bad.
Is that so?
Don't you think it is a good thing that she resembles me?
People will say we're real sisters and you'll have another daughter like me.
Is that so?
Okay.
What is the most auspicious day to adopt her as my daughter?
On Gyo Gi's marriage day, during Dong Myeong celebration.
Wouldn't it be a happy day for our family?
Good for you, now you are the Queen's respected sister.
May I still call you by your name?
Of course.
Later you will have to talk to her in a more respectful way.
If not, I'll cut your tongue off.
Aigoo!
Some people are so lucky!
She is so beautiful, and now, once into such a noble family, it will be really difficult to see her.
You are always so driven by appearance.
You rush and thus you make mistakes.
I'll go away for a while, with all that's going on here...
Why do you keep quiet?
I am worried.
About what?
While Ahgasshi was in charge of our business, everything went well.
I wonder what will happen now?
That is why I called you all, to have a talk.
Even if I leave to become the Prime Minister's adopted daughter, I shall not live there forever.
But, even so, I shall not be always available.
So, now I'll tell each of you exactly what to do.
Jeong Hwa will be responsible for our spice trade and she will also keep our finance records.
Yes.
MasterImJa willberesponsible for all our medicinal herbs and poisons.
ChoYeong,you'llbePrinceUiJa'sshadowandyouwillfollow himwherever hegoes.
Youwillalsotrainoursecretwarriors.
I hope you all do a very good job.
Yes, do not wory.
I, Im ja, am here to help you.
No manners at all!
I am sorry my lady.
It must be because I drank the love potion.
I feel sorry, but grandmother will have to work again.
She will have to supervise all work.
Damn it!
How on earth did it end like this?
!
How could such a thing happen?
Really!
Hey!
Are you crazy?
Ahgasshi Eun Go will become Sa Teok's daughter and she will enter their family.
She will be part of the family that's your father's mortal enemy.
She is waiting at their door.
Sa Taek is inviting people to the celebration.
You cannot trust a soul, these days...
Really...
I feel like killing someone right now...
Hey where are you going?
Let's eat breakfast!
So,iftheyask you tomarryGyoGi ,wouldyoudoit ?
I'll do it.
What ever it takes, I will do it.
EunGo...
Why can't I?
Icando it .
NotonlyGyoGi'swife ,I'dacceptbeingJeongDeok'sconcubine ,ifIhaveto ,toachievemygoal .
Stop.
Don't follow me.
Yes.
Hey!
Ahgasshi does not want to be followed.
She must be nervous.
Last night she drank a lot of water.
Are you still disappointed because of my decision?
No.
It is most distressful for you.
Please forgive me.
My heart was so heavy.
But now, as you seem to understand my motive, I am relieved.
Honestly,
I still don't understand you.
After such a sacrifice, to achieve your goal, how would you be able to live your life later on?
How would you live your life?
Are you worried because of me?
You should go back.
I feel so sorry for you...that is why I am like that.
I never thought about the future.
So, I don't even know if tomorrow will come for me either.
Why... the Prince, Ahgashi and even I... why do we have to carry the burden of our parents hatred?
Why do we have to live through this?
I don't understand why.
For the first time, today...
I hate my father.
It's good that it is raining now, sooner or later the sky will be clear again.
And the sun will rise again.
Master, you are really something!
How could you think of all this, under such pressure?
Yeah, I really don't know either.
You don't know, but since very young I heard people calling me "prodigy boy", so I'm quite fed up.
So, how old were you when you knew all about the history of the Three Kingdoms?
(Samguk sagi)
Who said I had to know history?
If we lure the Wi Je Group into action, they might come and get into trouble.
No, just let me find the best way to get them.
When everybody talks about Moon Geun, wouldn't you be curious to know more?
What is the sign of the Wi Je Group?
The sign?
They should have a tattoo on their left shoulder... or is it the right shoulder...?
What's the word?
Wi Je.
Wi Je...
Sure, they are the Wi Je Group, of course the tattoo is their name.
Some customers are here to see you.
So, you are the one who's a castaway?
Heads are of medium or small importance. 30, 20 or 10 silver tael each.
This head is worth 100 silver taels.
When the job is done, you get another 100 silver taels.
I heard that because of you, the Prime Minister and the other ministers became crimson red...
You cannot imagine how happy you made me.
I wasn't expecting less from you!
Don't ever recommend me again!
If you do it again, your face will also become crimson red!
Aigoo...
The Royal Court does not have skilled persons, what can I do?
How can you say there are no skilled persons?
What are you talking about?
The king is not assisted by skilled persons.
But there are many talented people in our country, people who live in oblivion.
This is a big problem.
Even if Sa Teok family has a lot of people working for them, all those people know only to flatter the nobles.
Now tell me, what is your opinion on Ui Ja?
Taking into account that you supported him, do you think he will ascend to the throne?
If he ascends to the throne?
!
Really!
Do you think I did what I did because I like Ui Ja?
Then... why?
Because I had enough!
And I wanted to see Sa Taek Bi's face when confronted.
Does this mean you don't like Ui Ja?
The bowl is too small.
As I see him, he's still thinking only how to take revenge.
If such a person takes the throne, we'll have a reign of terror.
He'd better be content with being your son-in-law.
You... really!
Then, help him become a wise king.
Do you think I feed you for free?
Don't you have any obligation at all?
Really...!
Is wine so expensive?
I shall not be able to come here in the future.
If you don't come here, is there another place where you could go?
Why not?
Don't I have a country, too?
If I go back, I'm a king!
A king!
Good for you!
If you go back, you'll be the king of the homeless.
Don't forget to take as many things as you can carry, when you go back there.
Why are you doing this?
What plans do you have in store for me?
You shouldn't be so aggressive.
Take with you what I give you.
It is not for you, but for those homeless children.
That is why I cannot be mad at you, Elder.
Let me give you a present too, Elder.
Find a man named Seong Chung.
You'll find him in prison.
Seong Chung?
We studied together.
He is not as good as I am, but he might be useful.
He could really help you.
Is that so?
I'm grateful, thank you.
Okay then.
Seon Chung...
Lonely Wolf!
You have to take your rice and money.
Why is he pretending?
Just leave him alone.
He doesn't seem to need anything...
Lonely Wolf!
Wolf!
Please, help me!
I have 5 kids at home.
If you don't need it, why not help me?
Listen, please help.
In the end, we were together through all the pain and suffering.
Let go.
Help him, and then you can go.
It's alright!
It's alright!
Please, stop.
We shouldn't be like this.
Sorry, Lonely Wolf.
I shouldn't have asked for your share.
Yes, you should go quickly.
Poor man!
He thinks only of himself, as if he were the only one in pain and suffering.
He is the most pathetic person.
How can men like that know love?
Those words were not for you, just keep going.
You will be given all the rice and your money.
Come inside!
Is this all the money we get?
I heard you were giving us each 2 silver taels.
You don't want it?
This is not what I meant.
But this is not what we were promised.
And who made that promise?
There... isn't it rice?
Sure it is.
Go there!
What is this?
Is it rice or sand?
!
Hey, you!
Can't you see it is rice?
Will you eat it if I put it in your mouth?
You!
Who do you think you are, shouting at us?
If you don't want it, go away!
You!
How dare they laugh at us?
Scoundrels!
-----empty-----
-----empty-----
Arrest him!
This is too much!
No!
Don't interfere!
You will all taste blood!
Do you like this room?
Yes, it is a very nice room.
I accepted you at the Queen's request, but I shall treat you like my own daughter.
Feel at ease, this is your home now.
Yes, Elder.
Don't be so protocolar.
Try again.
Should I do it slowly?
Why slowly?
Say it quickly.
You must dislike me.
No, that's not it.
Father.
How nice to hear that!
Hurry and prepare yourself.
The queen said to be sure to bring you along.
Also, from now, your identity is: of the pharmacy, the chief pharmacist.
Yes.
Father.
Mother.
Please watch over me.
Ipromiseyou,IshalldestroytheSaTaekfamily.
Please spare my life.
I was wrong.
Please save me.
I committed an unforgiveable sin.
Stop it.
They are mere servants.
What are you going to do now?
These people have become rebels.
What are you going to do now?
What did we do wrong?
We became slaves while fighting for our country.
While slaves, we didn't become traitors but rather we continued to fight for Baekje.
But then, is this how they should treat us?
But how could you turn the situation into this?
That's enough.
You should all find a way out of this.
I'll stay behind.
Stop talking nonsense.
I was the one who started the fight.
If someone were to stay behind, it would be me.
I'll stay behind, too.
Me, too I'll stay behind.
Baekje's subjects... have become Baekje's prisoners.
Seong Chung...
You said you'd help me once.
These people, save them.
Choehangwan, come here.
Ahongwan, come here.
What is it?
Your majesty, the returning slaves have caused a riot.
They've killed our soldiers and are rebelling.
What does that mean?
Why are they causing a riot at this happy time?
They said the money and rice were less than promised and they rioted.
Have you mobilized the troops?
Yes.
We surrounded them.
Please, give your order on what to do.
It is a problem that the riot started in the capital.
This is a big problem.
The citizens can throw their support behind the rioters.
You have to stop the riots quickly.
Is that so?
Aren't the returning slaves, our citizens, too?
If you don't stop the riots quickly, they can spread like fire.
Just because of a handful of rioters, you can't let the country go into chaos.
Mobilize the soldiers and kill all rioters.
Yes, your majesty.
What is it?
The leader of the rioters is Il Yee.
Did you just say Il Yee?
Yes.
Subtitlesbroughtto youbyGYEBAEKteam@viki.com
General, the order hasn't come yet.
Don't worry.
I'm checking things out.
You, guys!
Can't you open the door?
If you come out on your own, you will be forgiven.
If not, we'll force our way in and we'll kill you.
Forward.
Don't come any closer!
Next time, I'll hit your neck!
Why isn't there any news?
The order has to come so that we can move.
The King, the Queen and the ministers have all gone to the Dong Myeong Temple.
It is far from here, so the messenger cannot arrive so soon.
We barely escaped alive from that hell in Gajamseong.
What do we do now?
Are we all going to die?
Why are we going to die?
We didn't do anything wrong.
They are the ones who did something so wrong, that men and gods too would be angered.
And now they want to kill us.
Why kill us when we didn't do anything wrong?
Yes, that is true!
The more discontent people are, the louder they manifest themselves, but you're too quiet.
You must have someone you have faith in.
I looked around.
If we fight our way out, half will survive.
But the other half will die.
Also, they'll forever be on the run and be unable to see their families again.
Then they could be captured and killed.
Or starve to death... freeze to death...
In the end, they all die.
You asked me to save these people, didn't you?
Do you know any high-ranking people?
There could be a method if you do.
If I know someone, then what?
You'll have to get him over here and then we can think up something.
After that, we need to drag things out.
After that?
We'll have to decide depending on the situation.
The high-ranking person will be coming.
His Majesty ordered an immediate attack.
Let's start the fighting!
Forward!
Stop.
Gye Baek.
Gye Baek, where are you?
Where is Gye Baek?
Gye Baek.
If one person comes closer, this prince Ui Ja will be killed!
♥ Thank you for watching with us. ♥

The returning slaves have caused a riot.They've killed our soldiers and are rebelling.
You must mobilize the soldiers now and suppress them.
The leader of the rioters is Il Yee.
Have you just said Il Yee?
Yes, Your Highness.
They have done something that will raise the ire of man and god alike.
And now they want to kill us.
We didn't do anything wrong.
Why would they kill us?
!
You asked me to save these people, didn't you?
Do you know any high-ranking people?

Episode 13
Your Highness, is this our reward for helping you lay siege to Gajamseong City?
We believed in the royal family.
How could you do this to us?
Don't you have any pity for our people who died?
What was the reason we won?
We risked our lives to help you.
So that just the royal family could revel in it?
We must first calm down.
We can't change the past.
We have to find a solution now.
Let's hear what the prince has to say.
What should we do, Prince?
You should all live.
I'm saying, what can we do in order to survive this?
I'll try to convince the king and queen.
That's nonsense.
You're just saying that so that you can escape from here.
We definitely won't let you go.
We should tie him up first.
You ignorant fellow.
Don't butt in.
Why don't you stay still?
I believe that you want to save us.
But if you leave here, there will be nothing to save us from the soldiers outside.
Before you convince the king, we'll be dead.
Shield.
If the Prince can become our shield, would the Baekje soldiers launch an all out attack?
I don't know if they will attack us right now or not, but eventually they will definitely attack.
Even it it is temporary, we must figure out something.
Your Highness.
In any case, you cannot leave here.
I understand.
Sergeant, have your reinforced security?
Yes.
The riot forces may be coming here.
Be fully prepared.
I'll make sure that not even a mouse will escape.
Your Excellency, Your Excellency.
Your servant, Gong Cheon.
You're from the Ministry of External Affairs, why are you here?
That's right.
I have something to tell you.
What is it?
We've sent to your home 200 taels of silver and 100 bags of rice.
What?
Why did you send so much?
We've been repaying too little of Your Excellency's gratitude each time.
Therefore this time all of us had wanted to show our utmost sincerity.
Really?
Thank you, I will make good use of it.
Your Excellency.
Do you have something else to tell me?
Please, never forget that we're your loyal supporters.
I know that you are.
I treat you like my younger brother.
I'm busy now so let's talk later.
Yes, please go well.
Your Highness.
I sent the order.
Why haven't you resolved the situation yet?
I was about to follow the order but Prince Ui Ja showed up and was taken hostage.
What?
The king and queen have arrived!
The king and queen have arrived!
Not only did he not suppress the mob but he has now become a hostage.
He also impeded us from attacking while we were in Gajamseong city.
Why does this happen every time?
Now I can't really distinguish between what is right and wrong.
He made his own choice.
Excuse me?
Prince Ui Ja was in Gajamseong city with them in a life and death situation.
Are you saying that Prince Ui Ja still thinks of them as a team?
It seems he became a hostage because he wanted to save them.
They will not let Ui Ja go.
That's what I think, too.
We can't clamp down on them immediately.
The current situation has become particularly complex.
Now that the news of the riots has spread, the people are already panicking.
If they knew where Your Majesty was right now, they would think this is more serious than ever.
Go back with the Queen and let your servant be in charge here.
Yes, that's a good idea.
They won't do anything to Ui Ja because they too want to live.
First, let's have a talk with them, and then try to work things out well.
Concerning that... who should we send from our side?
I'll do it.
If you should go, since your ranking is too high, you might also be taken as a hostage.
If that should happen things will become more serious.
Who will be suitable?
There is a perfect person.
Since you are here, the other side will definitely send over someone to negotiate.
Also, after they rescue you, they'll definitely attack us.
I won't leave you.
Does that mean you're willing to die with us?
I'm going to live with you.
Thank you for the sentiment but do you think that's possible?
Please, come out.
They sent someone.
Complying with His Majesty's command, I'm Eun Go, a pharmacist from the Department of Pharmacology.
I saw you in Gajamseong city the last time.
That's right.
The heavens are helping us.
I know she's intelligent, but to give her such a big task, don't you think she's too young to handle it?
Didn't you say that she's like me?
She's much wiser and more accomplished than I was at her age.
Please, have trust in her.
I'll accompany the king back to the palace.
Please, take care of the situation.
I'm Seong Chung.
He can be trusted.
I'm uncomfortable without proof.
I'm also uncomfortable talking around people who I don't trust.
However, I cannot leave since many lives are at stake here.
So it's better for you to concede.
Didn't I tell you that he can be trusted?
Now, compared to us trusting you, it's more important that you should trust us.
Gye Baek is right.
We can't waste any more time.
Then tell me the reason why the situation has become like this.
The palace security is very tight, please rest assured.
But there's something I'm curious about.
What is it?
I heard captives were supposed to receive 20,000 taels of silver and 10,000 bags of rice.
It's not a small reward.
I don't understand why they rioted.
So that's why I'm saying they are robbers.
How much reward should we give them?
Perhaps.
They wouldn't be expecting that much.
Our representative went inside so we'll know soon.
These idiots.
They need to be praised all the time.
So this is the reason.
Though it started with the officials it has turned into a riot which will be difficult to deal with.
Eun Go, you must explain to them the reason why this happened, and fight for a reasonable resolution.
But still someone has to take responsibility for killing the soldiers.
Perhaps so.
It's also very important to tell His Majesty the reason for the riots, and especially Sa Taek Bi.
If we can provoke her, all the better.
That's a good idea... and the captives probability of survival will increase tremendously.
If we can communicate this to the Sa Taek family, it will be even better.
Come in, you beasts.
I brought them.
Who is the one that told you to give away this food?
I only used the food that was sent down to us.
No one told us.
Hey you beasts!
I came here to save your lives.
If you don't tell the truth, you'll die.
And I will inform Her Majesty to deal harshly with your family members!
I hope I won't have to see you here again.
Why do you keep involving yourself in dangerous situations?
That's what I want to know from you, too.
You were identified as the mastermind of this riot.
Why didn't you stay out of it?
I wanted to avoid it.
But, such an atrocity was occurring in front of me.
How could I not get involved?
Of course.
How can they defraud them of something they earned with their blood?
But, I don't know how the situation will be resolved.
If you do manage to walk away from this unscathed, you can never call attention to yourself again.
If you get in trouble again, not 10 or even 100 lives will be enough to save you.
Am I pitiful?
It would be nice if you don't get hurt again.
In body or feelings.
What happened?
You definitely requisitioned rice to be sent down.
The officials caught by the captives said, they were directed by Gong Cheon from the Ministry of External Affairs to do so.
The official from the Ministry of External Affairs, Gong Cheon, had three years ago, been dismissed because of corruption.
How did he get reinstated?
I'm sorry but, the rioters, instead of blaming him, were blaming Your Majesties for this matter.
Until now Your Majesties had always been held in high esteem who always put the people first.
That Your Majesties appointed such tyrannical officials, that's their complaint.
Daejwapyeong!
Have Gong Cheon arrested immediately.
Yes, Your Majesty.
What is Ui Ja doing?
He is being held by the captives.
Why does a prince cause so much trouble?
Did you say the masterminds were Il Yi and Seong Chung?
Yes.
They are intelligent fellows.
Even if the officers are corrupted this cannot be linked to His Majesty.
But they... wanting to reduce their sins to a minimum, decided to provoke His Majesty and me.
Your Majesty, although the officials must be severely punished, you must not let the rioters off lightly.
Arrest Gong Cheol of the Ministry of External Affairs immediately.
Yes.
Your Excellency.
What is it?
Although it's late, I wanted to congratulate you on getting an adopted daughter.
I've sent some money to your house.
Do you know where you are right now?
It is in times like this that you have more usage for this.
I understand so let's talk later.
But... are you going to suppress the captives now?
It's not that.
I'm going to arrest the person who caused the captives to riot.
Caused it?
They attempted to make a profit out of giving them food mixed with sand.
Oh my!
Those bastards!
No wonder the captives rioted.
Who are these people?
External Affairs, Gong Cheol.
D-d-daejwapyeong...
What's wrong with you?
Having a relationship with those officials is already troubling enough... but you too father?
I have no excuse.
I did send it away though.
Why do you need such things?
You may not know this since you live in the palace.
It takes a lot of supplies to support the nobility and the armed forces.
Yet, this isn't right.
Even if all the other families were to do this, our Sa Taek's family must remain virtuous.
Honesty is the best weapon, don't you know that?
Is that so?
Perhaps.
This is certain though the security of our positions requires that we maintain this much in supplies.
I just want to maintain Your Majesty's clean image.
Please, stop.
I'm sorry.
What are we going to do about this problem?
Although action has been taken, we can't allow Gong Cheol to affect our family and the aristocracy.
It's embarrassing.
It's really embarrassing.
Gong Cheol's house
-Search.-Yes.
General, they've already escaped.
They can't have left the city yet.
Guard the gates.
Yes.
The cause of the riot lies with the royal family.
Although it's troubling, it is not wrong.
The common people will think Your Majesty appointed the wrong kind of people.
So, do you want me to release the captives?
How can we do that?
Banish them so that they will live a life of suffering.
If you do that, the common people and the captives will be grateful to the royal family.
There is something she's hiding.
I wonder if Dae Ja Pyong is involved.
My idea is different.
When we arrest the people involved in this corruption, they'll be severely punished.
Furthermore, I cannot forgive the captives who killed our soldiers.
All of them must die.
We cannot let those who killed the soldiers live.
If this should happen again, they'll think they are not at fault and that it's the fault of the royal family.
Then this country will become a lawless country.
I've nothing else to say.
Are you saying you don't want to handle this compassionately but you want it done according to the due process of the law?
That's right.
But those men have just returned home from the battlefield.
The peasants will think this punishment too harsh.
Only then will it be effective.
If we treat the rioters sternly, who will dare do the same thing again?
Your Majesty, may I say something?
Speak.
As the saying goes, to set a precedent is the correct principle.
However in my opinion, to show compassion to the captives is the way to capture the hearts of the common people.
The peasants see their male family members go off to war not knowing if they will be captured.
In such a situation, to fight against corruption by officials, if we were to show compassion to those captives, people can then tell their sons who'll be going to battle this: trust the country and the royal family and kill the enemies courageously.
The peasants will think highly of the royal family.
Such immature thinking.
The country's stability is more important than the popularity of the royal family.
We can show them the royal family's compassion at any time, however, with the country's present serious situation, we must not lose this opportunity
Don't you think so, my queen?
Tell them, if they release Ui Ja, I will not kill them.
If not... they all die.
Do you know why the king is reacting so strongly?
Most of the power is held by the Sa Taek familyand the aristocracy.
His Majesty would like to take this opportunity to use the people to spearhead a change toward the Sa Taek family and the aristocracy.
Your observation is correct.
Don't you think you should tell them?
No, right now there's no way to change the king's mind.
For now it is just a power struggle.
What does that mean?
Exchange.
Get rid of Ui Ja and all the captives.
It'll be dangerous for you to deliver the king's message.
I'll send someone else.
No, this is my duty.
I'll do it.
In that case, take some soldiers with you.
No, the situation will get more complicated if more soldiers are involved.
I'll just take my personal guards.
I understand.
The king came out so strongly?
Yes.
He came out so strongly even though Prince Ui Ja is captured.
This is precarious.
I think I have to meet with the king.
You go and bring Heung Su here.
Quickly!
Yes.
Spread it around thoroughly so that we can hear even a cat's paw steps.
Yes.
We can't defend ourselves against the troops using this.
This isn't for victory.
It's just a delay tactic.
And if we delay?
We'll have more time to think of something.
Do you think you can stop the soldiers by using this method?
Are you crazy?
How can we stop all those soldiers?
Perhaps if I were to call for a ghost or something...
In the end, we have to run away.
Those rebel guys.
How could they kill the people?
Do they use their mouths for only eating?
They should have said it with words.
You really can't understand some people.
And so, has the prince decided to join in with the rebels?
That's right.
If we don't save the rebels, the prince will be in danger.
It's probably not about the rebels but about Il Yee.
Il Yee?
Who is that?
His Highness and the captives went through thick and thin together in Gajamseong city.
He doesn't want those returning slaves to be killed.
What should we do?
Chu Yeong and I will lead the guards into the government office.
Do I have to fight with the government troops?
Have you forgotten that your duty is to protect the prince?
But if we kill the country's soldiers, we'll become just like the rebels.
It doesn't matter.
If I were to die, no one would care anyway.
What should I do?
Ajussi, make some lanterns and kites.
Lanterns?
I'm going to tell the peasants about what's happening to the rebels.
Please, make a lot.
Okay.
It'll be a big help if the peasants reacted after being told what was happening to the returning slaves.
Where are you going?
I should do my job, too.
Looks like they've come to scout around.
It means they'll be launching an attack soon.
Warriors are approaching the front gate.
Stop.
These warriors are those that serve the prince.
Well...
Even in such situation, they're still so loyal?
Hurry and put away your weapons.
It would be better if we had more fighters.
You'll then report that the guards were defeated.
We have to make noises of a sword fight.
Attack!
It's either a complete surrender or death for everyone?
Is that what the king really said?
I don't believe it.
No matter what his thinking is, he should not be obsessed and think of the people's feelings.Admirable.
We forgot to take into account His Majesty.It seems like we have lost.
His Majesty is trying to turn the grievances on the Sa Taek family and the aristocracy.
That's right.
Isn't the king worried about his son's life?
Do you all think the king and I are of the same team?
My father would, in order to save his place on the throne, step over his dead son to get there.
He stepped over my dead mother, too.
His Majesty's words did not convey to me that he wanted Your Highness to die with the captives.
He's telling you to leave here quickly.
He's really a scary person.
That's why he's been able to protect his position for so long.
Did you come to discuss Ui Ja?
Your Majesty.
What are you really going to do if something happens to Ui Ja?
Ui Ja is staying there purposely.
If I don't do this, he won't be able to cast off his offence.
What are you going to do if he stays with the rebels to the end?
Since he got himself in there, he should be able to think of a way out.
There will be a way for him to come out voluntarily.
There should be a way.
Your Majesty.
Daejwapyeong Mun Jin is seeking an audience with you.
When you leave here, will the attack begin?
If you don't surrender, that's what will happen.
Looks like... we have to surrender?
There is a way to survive but...
I guess it's a bit dangerous?
Your Majesty.
Are you really going to abandon the prince?
Right now, I'm testing Ui Ja.
If he stays with the rebels and throws his life away, then he's incapable of accomplishing anything great.
If he has the guts to live to his potential, he will kill the rebels and even his kin to live and come out alive.
Your Majesty.
That is too dangerous.
You should have a discussion with the captives and rescue the prince.
Daejwapyeong...
I just said it.
To be defeated in a war with other countries is acceptable.
But we must win the war if it's within the country.
This is a small battle in his struggle for survival.
If Ui Ja abandons the rebels and comes out alive,
I will sincerely acknowledge him and
I will work harder to raise Ui Ja to the throne.
The only death will be that of the ringleader?
That's right.
If they do that, they'll be able to right the wrongs of the country, and if they then show compassion to the rest of the captives, this will be appreciated.
That's nonsense.
Weren't the ringleaders Gye Baek and you?
I'm prepared to die.
I don't know about this guy.
No matter how much I think, this is the only way.
This won't do.
We're going to all survive or we're all going to die.
I don't consent to this.
Your Highness is presently a hostage.
I'm against this, too.
Who is going to survive and who is going to die?
This won't do.
The men outside won't want this either.
You and Your Highness do not know what the captives want.
Of course.
Shall we go out and ask them?
Have you all understood what I said?
Whether it's life or death, we do it together.
Those who agree, come forward.
Why are you asking us something so obvious?
Where is there a ringleader?
If we die or live, we have to do it together, a common destiny.
Don't you all think so?
What?
How can you all act like that?
Hyungnim and Il Yee are willing to die.
You're going live?
You, guys...really...
Can't you all come forward?
Baek Pa...
I don't want to do this either but,
I served three years in the army and out of that spent two years as a captive.
Do you think I've not thought of death?
But,
I still have a wife and kids to support.
My kids who were waiting for me to return.
Seeing those guys' faces just once.
That was my hope.
I'm sorry...
Are you the only one with family?
I have a mother and siblings.
Stop it!
You... must survive.
Since I volunteered to do this, don't feel sorry.
Why are you doing this?
The other side may not accept this proposal.
We have to make them accept this.
We can't just let the two of you be sacrificed.
I should also remain behind.
You're very frustrating.
Ill Yee and I have to stay behind in order for everyone else to survive.
Lower your voice.
How dare you boast here?
You're such an ignorant person.
Are you sincere or is this a ploy?
Be careful of the lantern.
Okay, go up.
Hurry, hurry.
Good.
Be careful when you're picking up the lantern and when opening them to do an inspection.
Okay, if you're ready, light the fire.
Hold it firmly.
Focus on what you're doing.
Get the kites ready for flying.
Yes!
Cut it.
What kind of pigs are these?
The smell.
Why does the pig smell so...
Tell it to turn its backside.
It keeps its backside pointed at me.
I'm going to go crazy.
Go.
Go, pig, go.
Go!
Oh, really.
The pig smell is so strong.
It's driving me crazy.
Dae Soo and Yong Soo...
We're people.
Even if we say that we committed unpardonable sins,
I still think it isn't right for people to have to live with pigs.
I think so, too.
Mu Geum is such a ruthless person.
I'm going to go nuts.
If I were to die, I want to die like a person, not like a pig.
Go, you.
Oh, really.
I'm starting to hallucinate.
Definitely, it wasn't there before but now there's the moon.
It's the moon.
The moon is correct but it looks a bit small.
It looks small because it's so high up.
The moon is moving.
As I see the moon,
I'm reminded of the song my mother used to sing to me when I was young.
... Moon you're hung so high illuminating my my head...
What is this?
It's a kite.
It's covered in writing.
Read it.
Oh, right.
You don't know how to read.
Give it to me.
We soldiers returned home to our country after achieving a great victory, but what we received from this country's royalty was only rice mixed with sand and a few coins.
Corrupt officials!
Oh, such rotten guys.
They deserve to go to hell.
We want to live, too.
We also want to go back to our families.
It's so pitiful.
These rotten, greedy managers.
How could they do that to those people?
Please, stop crying.
Yes, it's so unlike you.
Please stop the tears.
The leftover Oo Seok San... shall we give them to the captives?
Shall we send it over to the rebels, so that they will pluck up their strength?
It should be okay.
Will it be okay?
Since they don't have any money, let's charge them only half price.
That's still a lot of money, we'll just collect more from those who have.
Those pitiful rebels.
What?
Only punish the ringleaders?
That's a brilliant idea.
By doing that, we save the country's state of affairs and Your Majesty's grace.
That's a way to capture two rabbits with one stroke.
How dare they propose to negotiate.
I won't do that.
Your Majesty, Naesin Jwapyeong is here.
Show him in.
What's that in your hand?
Your Majesty, overnight these fell from the sky.
These kites concern the plight of the captives.
What?
Aigoo!
Aigoo... my child...
Go home quickly.
My son is there.
My son who has returned home after 3 years is over there.
I'll die with him.
Please let me do that.
Get away!
Bastard!
Don't you all have parents and siblings too?
Release the captives from there quickly.
Mother...
Mother!
Mother!
That pharmacist's idea was very good.
Just by using kites, she was able to gather all the people here.
It looks like the chance of the other side accepting our proposal has improved.
Apart from the idea of you two going out, is there no other way?
No, there isn't.
Please take the men and move out of danger.
I can't do that, leaving the two of you behind.
You have to do that.
Only when you and the men have gone, can I escape from here.
Please, don't continue to cling to me so annoyingly.
Do as we tell you to do.
There is a village out there that adopts children.
If you tell them my name they'll let you enter.
The peasants have gotten involved.
You should give in.
I know the reason why you're doing this.
You know that nothing good will come about by provoking the nobility.
I'm stabilizing the country.
What does that have to do with the nobility?
You know this well.
Perhaps.
I don't know.
Your Highness.
What is it?
The priestess has come to meet with you.
When you say priestess, do you mean Chun Dan Yan?
That is right.
When we were looking for her, she went into hiding but now she's showing herself here.
Send her in.
Yes, Your Highness.
Your Majesty and My Queen.
Have you been well?
It's been a long time.
Even though we have not seen you for so long you are just as beautiful.
Your Majesty is the same.
No matter how hard I tried to look for you, you were not to be found.
I didn't realize you were looking for me.
I, who was driven out, how can I appear before the people?
So please tell us why you have come here.
Although I was driven out from here, while I was in the mountains, whenever a festival approached,
I felt I should do something.
For the current festival, I came to pray.
That's something to be grateful for.
However, at that sacred time, I saw a carnage.
Either it's the death penalty or the preparations for it.
Your Majesty, it appears that Sinyeo's vision is correct.
We have not done it yet.
Then you are saying there are plans to do so?
Your Majesty can't do this.
Don't you already know that you are not to see blood in these four days?
This is not the time for death penalties or hunting.
This will bring forth a bloody disaster for the country.
That could be suggested during the time when Xinyeo had the right to intervene, but now you no longer have such rights.
I'm interfering on behalf of the people of this country.
What tomorrow brings, no one can predict.
That's just a superstition.
Whether it's a prediction or not, you must do as I say.
You may leave.
I will leave after I say one more thing.
When confusion reigned during the period of the previous government,
I said the same thing.
But the King, after the festival, killed those nobels who opposed him.
That year the king...
Can you not shut up?
If you continue to threaten me, I will not consider that you were once the Sinyeo, and kill you.
Priestess Chun Dan Yan.
I too wish to stop His Majesty.
Now it seems I have a helper.
Therefore, if you help me, I can allow you to come back and enjoy all your previous benefits.
Although I'm very grateful,
I'm like the full moon, I can't lie.
Are you saying that Ui Ja's star is still shining brighter than Gyo Gi's?
Why are you causing me so much trouble by bringing me here?
That's why I didn't want totake the rice in the first place.
Your words are a bit harsh.
What's unwarranted?
Since he's anxiously looking for me, there must be something quite troublesome.
Am I wrong?
Let's go inside.
Aigoo!
I... really...
I thought it was a big problem.
If something happens to him, my daughter will become an unmarried widow.
This is a big problem.
If it isn't, then what is?
Father.
Listen, Heung Su, think of a way, make full use of your intelligence.
Really...
Seong Chung can't even get himself out of that place, what is he doing?
He doesn't seem like what you'd described.
He can't even match up to an inch of you.
That is true.
I really wanted to see this but I'm too furious now.
We're discussing His Highness's life and death issue.
How can you take this so lightly?
Oh, Tae Yeon.
Father, I really don't know, why you are always flattering this kind of person.
Can't you stop?
She didn't say anything wrong.
Agassi, are you wondering why your father is begging me?
Then I'll let you see.
Elder, I'll go and take a look at the scene first.
When confusion reigned during the period of the previous imperial government,
I said the same thing.
But the king, after the festival, killed those nobilities who opposed him.
That year the king...
That's a brilliant idea.
That way, the country's affairs and Your Majesty's compassion, we can solve the two things together.
Is there anyone outside?
Did you send for me?
Tell the captives, as long as they give us the mastermind, the rest will not be harmed.
Yes, Your Highness.
His Majesty said that except for the mastermind, the rest will live.
Then I can take my soldiers and kill everyone.
You can't kill everyone.
Of course some have to survive in order for them to spread the word to the peasants and for them to blame the king.
We are getting rid of Prince Ui Ja?
Just make it look like he was killed by the captives.
Yes, Your Highness.
By doing that my task is completed.
You worked hard.
In the city too, how is it you can't let me rest?
If this is successful, I will reward you handsomely.
That's a certainty.
I never accept anything for free and never give anything for free either.
This is Her Majesty's plan.
She's worthy to be the Queen.
I know, go and get ready.
Yes.
The king has issued his benevolence.
The two who started this rebellion, will be punished but the other men will not be.
Who are the two masterminds?
Hurry and tell us!
Men named Il Yee and Song Choon are the ones.
Both are shameless and contemptuous.
If they put up a strong resistance, then all of you may get hurt.
So, everyone return home.
Let's go.
You have worked hard, father.
It's my turn now.
Will it be okay?
Please, don't worry.
The captives also want to live.
Even if the masterminds don't agree, the rest of the captives will seize them and bring them out.
I understand.
Be careful.
It's me, Eun Go.
Okay, what happened?
Except for the two masterminds the rest are released.
It turned out well.
I'm surprised.
I'm impressed that you could influence the peasants in such a short period of time.
I can't let them take Gye Baek.
I've made all the arrangements.
Make your escape in a short while.
You had the same idea as us.
So that's why you asked for only the masterminds to be sacrificed, because if everybody moves together, it'll be difficult for you to make your escape.
That's right.
I'm sorry that I couldn't tell you earlier.
I don't care about such things as long as you can survive.
Can I not run away, too?
We've readied two horses.
If you two run away, the rebels outside may all be killed.
We have to find a way for them to escape alive.
They can't live the rest of their lives as fugitives.
That's why I plan on taking the rest of the rebels to a safe place.
Let's meet at that place.
These are the leaders of the rebellion:
Il Yee and Song Choon!
What about Prince Ui Ja?
The prince is here!
We'll release him when we're safe.
Make a path for them.
But if you have an ulterior plan, you'll all die.
This way.
Let's go.
Crazy horse!
Watch out!
Now...
Catch those guys!
Thank you for watching with us!

Episode 14
Stop.
Let's enter the forest.
I didn't expect you to have such loyalty.
I'm not doing this for you.
I don't know the way.
Really?
You should go first.
What are you saying?
We have to go together.
You leave first, I'll stay behind, or we'll both be captured.
It will work better this way.
You must come, Gye Baek.
What is this place?
The road leading to the village.
Do you know how to read the eight diagrams map?
This map is drawn using numbers.
This is the eight diagram map
That's right.
This is more complex than a normal map.
If you can remember where the exit is, it's not so difficult.
You can't stray from the path I am leading you to.
Yes.
Is this the first time seeing people living?
Why are you observing us like that?
The embarrassing prince.
But you...
Yes.
I was the one who made that proposal back then, Heung Su is my name, but you didn't wear that official gown.
Aigoo.
I made such a ruckus.
It has gone to waste.
Is this the village that you live in?
I don't live here by myself.
As you see, there are many other people living here.
Look here.
Don't you know he is the prince?
How can you talk like that?
The way I see it, you should be the one to act properly.
Also, here
Your Highness's status is the lowest.
All the people living here, are kings.
Of course,
I'm king, too.
Hey, mannerless king!
Oh, my, oh my...
We have not met in a long time, homeless king.
Oh, really.
Why is it that the moment you appear you had to bring so many people along?
As it is, we don't have enough food to eat.
You arrived safely.
You suffered much.
He is the one you studied with?
Although we studied together, he was disrespectful to the teacher, and was kicked out.
I wasn't kicked out.
I left because there wasn't anything more to learn.
What about Gye Baek?
You lost all of them?
Is that worth mentioning?
I'm sorry.
The Minister of External Affairs, Gong Cheol, could not be found either.
When the soldiers arrived, he had fled.
Are you sure there was really a riot?
The official who was the cause of it disappeared... the captives who complained also disappeared...
It must be the work of a ghost.
Look here, Dae Ja Pyong!
Do you think I'm an idiot?
I think it is because you were one of the accomplices, that's why you let them go.
Your Majesty... accomplice?
You are wrong to accuse me of this.
Is that so?
Can you take responsibility for that?
I can stake everything on that.
Is that so?
Let's wait and see.
What did you just say?
You lost Ui Ja?
After we received your orders we went there.
My people followed him and entered a forest.
But then they were like blinded by a smoke screen, not able to see one step ahead.
It is a new strategy, something we never met before.
It is a formation of trigrams used for hiding everything under heavy smoke.
It doesn't make sense.
Ui Ja has no knowledge of strategy based on trigrams.
Who helped him?
There is someone.
Someone is helping him.
Find who it is.
Find out who is helping Ui Ja.
Yes.
It is already so late.
Shouldn't we be looking for him?
We can't run into the soldiers.
Let's wait.
I heard the news.
Don't worry.
He will come.
He will definitely come.
He must.
Something must have happened.
I'll look for him.
I will look.
You can't be noticed by the soldiers.
What guy is this, for you and this lovely ahgassi to both insist on searching for?
Even if he's already dead, I'm envious.
You, guy!
Don't say such nonsense!
Please, forgive him.
He's normally this loose-lipped.
Loos-lipped?
!
I saved your lives and you say...!
Gye Baek.
Hey.
Seeing someone eating a meal, and making me this happy, it's a first.
I really thought something happened to you.
I'm sorry for making you worry.
Of course, you should be sorry.
Also, I hope to never again hear the words "I'm sorry".
Please, make it your habit to protect your body.
I don't need to protect it.
The only reason I had was disallowed by you.
Apart from that, there are many reasons for you to go on living.
Look at all these people.
They're all orphans, homeless people, many of them lost their families.
How can you say their lives don't have sadness or joy?
And yet they still live on.
They comfort each other when they're lonely and frightened.
They plow the fields and eat their meals together.
They wake up together and live on together.
Although they live an ordinary life, they have many reasons to go on living.
How can I live comfortably when you have such a difficult task before you?
Perhaps after I finish my task,
I may live like these villagers.
Then, you, ahgassi... ahgassi... please become the reason for my living on.
A good day, when a good day arrives,
I'll do that.
Although staying for a few days won't be a problem, what we have is just sufficient for us to live.
We don't have that much food.
But I saw earlier, a guy eating a pot of rice.
Whether money or food, please tell me.
I'll supply it to you.
She runs a trade group in the capital.
Please accept these people here.
Why are you being like this?
If things don't go your way, are you going to buy this village?
Please listen carefully.
There is no nobility, king, or anyone who can be influenced by money here.
Nobody gives orders here and nobody follows orders here.
We all work the same and share everything.
Although with the drought this year we had to borrow some food from Lord Yeon, we don't take anything from anyone outside of this village.
Why?
Because those giving us something might then get the idea that they could order us around.
It is not an order, but the sincere wish to be kind.
I understand your fear, but please believe us, there is nothing more than kindness to our offer.
Okay.Sincerity...
I'll accept your sincerity.
But, please do not misunderstand our kindness.
More than anything, what is important is, if they want to become one of us, they must be of one mind with us.
That would be great.
This village is like the world we dreamed of.
I want to join in this dream.
I want to make a world like this village for the rest of the peasants.
Song Choon, Hyong Soo, Gye Baek, Eun Go.
Can you help me?
You...
I've been tricked !
If that's what you really mean, maybe I can help?
If Your Highness is the person in charge, then I don't have to follow that imbecile prince.
Fine.
I'll become your arm.
Have you now seen a world that's more important than revenge?
I, Eun Go , will help Your Highness to achieve the kind of world that you dream of.
Gye Baek.
Do you still dislike doing anything with me?
It doesn't matter if you don't want to be with me.
I wish you wouldn't run away and instead, just live here in this village for a long time.
I have to return to the capital.
I'll come back.
Why aren't you eating?
I put a lot of pork in it.
I will only eat vegetarian food.
You, too?
If the chief eats vegetarian food, we'll follow suit.
Come here.
Take another smack.
You really have no conscience.
Can you really eat now?
We were with the pigs just a little while ago.
Can you really eat this?
I didn't eat anything for the past week.
You're the leader.
You can't let your subordinates go hungry.
Hurry and eat.
Hurry and eat.
He told you to eat, so eat.
If you're hungry, just drink it.
But Moon Goon, I have a question.
If you're going to get rid of us, you should get rid of us.
Why do you keep getting rid of us and then calling us back?
If you're going to send us out, just cleanly send us out.
If you're going to kill us, then re-think that one.
Dak Gae.
Have you ever killed someone worth 200 silver taels?
200 silver taels?
On this Baekje land, where is a 200 yang neck?
Have you heard?
I never heard that before.
Me, too.
Unless it's someone royal.
Of course, a royal person.
A royal?
Are you talking about a royal person now?
If I were, what would you do?
Share your experience as a sunbae with me.
Now you need my advice... really...
It's not me.
Why?
People like us can offer only financial advice, nothing more.
But, as far as politics is concerned, we cannot offer any suggestion.
Even if they pay a large amount of money...
It can't be done.
Nope.
Look at me.
I got dragged into the incident with Mu Jin and the royals.
I've been suffering ever since.
Failure might bring suffering, but success can also be very sweet.
We might even meet the Wi Je Group.
That is true but this time listen to your elder.
Listen to me.
Shall we team up?
Your brain works well and I work well with the knife.
Team up...?
Let's see. 50-50?
Right.
Fighting uses strength and it is dangerous so, the share has to be different.
How about 60-40?
100-0
So I'm a zero... a zero...
You were released by those men...
Were you not the one who fought out?
No.
They abandoned me in an unknown place and I got lost trying to come back home.
What?
Are you trying to fool me?
You seem to risk your life for them.
Don't you want to ascend to the throne?
Ascend to the throne?
I've never dreamt about it.
As for killing them in order to ascend to the throne, it is out of the question.
You fool.
Do you think the throne is such a clean seat?
To reach the throne you have to walk on a river of blood and have every bone in your body broken.
Of course the throne is sitting on a river of blood and many broken bones, as it happened to my mother's blood and Mu Jin's.
That's right.
That position is like that.
But I know you are the same.
When you heard about the Queen's and the Prime Minister's plan for Gyo Gi, you were after the throne.
Isn't this the reason you married Yeon Mun Jin's daughter?
Don't think I'm like you.
If I were to choose between the throne and the loved one,
I would give up the throne in a blink of an eye.
And?
Do you want to join hands with the people in that village?
Yes.
No, I cannot.
Helping them once or twice is alright, but more means destroying us.
But Ui Ja already joined hands with them.
Does that mean we have to stand by and just watch?
Actually, I'm not really in favor of helping Ui Ja.
Sir.
How can we be certain that Ui Ja will rise to the throne?
I think it would be better to support Gyo Gi.
Shouldn't we back up the one who has more chances to win?
Mister Im Ja...
There's something you don't know yet.
Do you think we're helping Ui Ja just for our business advantage?
If not for that?
We're doing something for the nation right now.
Even if the chances to find the rebels are slim, we've contacted other merchants so we'll be able to find them shortly.
Also, the one who caused the riot, Gong Cheol...
That's enough.
It would be good if you removed yourself from this problem.
Pardon?
Is there something wrong?
No.
I just want you to monitor Ui Ja's every move.
There is definitely someone helping Ui Ja.
I think that too.
Tomorrow is Ui Ja and Yeon Mun Jin's daughter's wedding.
Keep an eye on those people there too.
Yes.
Tonight, they're recruiting helpers for the wedding.
I'll go in as a helper and look around.
Where the heck is this guy?
Why isn't he coming in?
I don't know whether he wants to eat or not.
This guy, really...
Aigoo...this guy...
I eat properly as I go around.
What?
Where the heck have you been wandering?
Do you know how worried I was about you when I heard the news about the rioting by the captives?
A riot by the captives?
Yes.
They turned the government office upside down and then fled.
Really?
After sleeping with the prince, I went here and there in the city.
The city has changed a lot.
Of course.
But, have you completely closed off the thought of revenge?
What power do I have?
Ah... don't think like that.Furthermore ajussi, it's better if you were to spend the rest of your days peacefully.
This kind of bad guy.
I badly misjudged you.
I'm sorry.
Ah, by the way, what are all those swords?
The royal family is holding a martial arts competition.
All those people just want to gain favour for themselves by throwing a few knives.
You'd better catch some sleep now, I still have things to finish up.
Eat this.
Yes.
I'm really going to be married.
Does it disturb you?
I'd be lying if I said it didn't.
You have to endure it.
Okay.
You endure living as Dae Ja Pyong's daughter.
I should be able to endure this.
I don't know if mother approves of her daughter-in-law.
Tae Yeon agassi is a beautiful and graceful woman.
Once you live with her, you'll grow to love her.
Is that so?
You shouldn't go through a marriage like this.
You should marry a man that you want to marry.
Me, marry?
I haven't thought about it at all.
A good day.
When a good day arrives.
The man who meets you will be very happy.
Ohh...
Your face...
Prince, what is it?
This marriage is not to your liking?
Of course it's not to my liking!
After I get married I won't be able to have a good time with the ladies anymore.
Let's hurry up and go.
Prince!
Thank you for having faith in me and for giving her to me.
My daughter understands the significance of this marriage, but this is still a marriage between two people.
You must give her a lot of love.
I will do so.
Tae Yeon.
We have gotten on the same boat as the prince.
You have to take good care of him.
Yes, older brother.
Father, until the prince achieves his goal, I will work hard, so please don't worry.
Okay.
I will believe in you.
When my mother comes here, she will dance with joy.
My wife and kids will, too.
Isn't it blissful here?
We should go and bring them here.
Don't you have anyone to bring?
None
Although I have no family members, there are a few people I would like to bring over.
The family members of the captives who died in that government office.
If I bring their family members here to live, they will rest in peace.
Can you help me?
Life is really stupid, sometimes.
He didn't have an official position, neither did he have any property.
Just so he could see his family one last time, he had to live through hell.
To be killed in his own country by his fellow soldiers, how should I tell his family members?
I think we're here.
The old folk are so pitiful.
She so wanted to see her son.
How in the world could something like this happen?
Despicablecriminal-familyoftheformer prisonerofwarin Shilla
Who?
Who killed this person?
Soldiers who came from the government office.They said she's the mother of a murderer.
That's why they killed her!
Let's go to another place.
They deserve to go to hell !
How could they...
How could a person do this?
Baek Pul lost his mother and younger brother.
You know a lot.
Let me ask you one question.
Does the world change a person or, does a person change the world?
People live in the world so, of course, people have to change the world.
You are going to enter the palace?
You can't.
It's too dangerous.
It's not like the previous occasion, where I wanted to kill the Queen.
Also, I already know what I did wasn't really revenge.
I too want to be by her side, and get rid of her powers one by one.
No.
I can't agree to this.
Why not?
I want to reach into their hearts and tear off their limbs one by one.
Gye Baek, you're different from the prince and me.
You can't fool yourself, so you definitely cannot fool the royalty.
Prince.
Please, tell him.
You have to stop him.
Eun Go is right.
It's too reckless.
I'm not saying this to get your consent.
It's just that I'm beginning to understand now what I should do.
Just like agassi said.
Why did my father live the way he did?
He wielded a sword for the sake of the world.
People want to live like human beings, they don't want to live like animals.
Okay.
If that's what you want, I won't stop you.
Shortly, they'll be holding contests to select royal guards.
If you can show your strong skills there, you may be able to get in.
Prince.
No.
This is not something blinded by hatred.
I'm still not comfortable with you becoming the daughter of the opposition leader.
If Gye Baek is there for you, then my mind will be a little relieved.
Prince.
What are you going to do?
Will you enter the contest?
Or will you try in the next contest?
I'll try.
Your Majesty, these are the eight newly appointed officials in the security department.
I heard that there were more candidates than last time.
Seeing that they got this far, they must be very skilled.
Isn't there a saying, "Bai Mei is the best among the 5 brothers of the Ma family"
Won't there be one particular piece of jade, among precious stones, that would be of top quality?
In accordance with tradition, Your Majesty will select one whom you will present a sword to personally.
You should also select your guard.
I don't need any new guards.
My palace has always been guarded well by my palace guards.
They are comfortable with each other.
How would you like to have the selected guard?
Yes, that's right.
Auntie going to and from home to the Palace with just a few people, is very dangerous.
Aren't we supposed to be selecting a guard for the royal family?
The safety of the royal family will ensure the stability of Baekje.
I have personal guards already, so please don't be concerned for me.
Start it.
Begin the contest!
The competition has ended.
What are the names of the finalists?
One is Cha Bo, the iron headed man from Pabolijeon.
And this person, is called Sing Hee, he's from this city.
You should just stay down.
Don't just be defensive.
Show some offence.
Your skill is remarkable.
Did you say your name is Sing Hee?
Yes, Your Highness.
Where did you learn to fight?
I never learned from anyone.
Does that mean you don't have a teacher?
If I were to mention a teacher,
I would say it would be like this fellow, a fighter.
They were all teachers to me.
You have no teacher.
That is strange.
Okay, tell me which position you want.
I want to serve the queen.
The queen?
How come the queen and not me?
Although your servant lives in the marketplace,
I've always remembered Her Majesty's virtuous prestige.
I want to serve the queen.
I feel sad.
I guess the queen will have to take you in.
I'm jealous that you get such a talented warrior.
In that case, you will have to serve me.
Yes.
As I said before, I don't need a new guard.
You should take him.
Do you dislike me?
You're very offensive.
Have a cup of tea.
Hurry and drink.
It's the queen's tea.
Isn't it hot?
It must be very tiring for you to have to guard the Prince.
Drink it.
She's rewarding you.
Isn't it hot?
It's Nam Jo.
Have you found Geom Cheon of External Affairs?
Not yet.
You still haven't found him?
What have you been doing?
I've searched the city but there has been no sign of him.
It's definite that he already left the city.
If we let him off just like that, he will become a bigger trouble later on.
Naesin jwapyeong must know his whereabouts.
Did you search that house?
Yes.
That day, naesin jwapyeong was with daejwapyeong the entire day.
Naesin jwapyeong?
-Leave me.-Yes.
Hyo Seo.
Did you call for me?
I'm going to see Dae Ja Pyong.
Get ready.
Yes, Your Highness.
Wait.
Minimize the protocol concerning our departure.
I'll just take you and a few guards.
And... bring the champion of today's competition, Sing Yee, here.
Who are you?
Attack!
Hurry and escape.
I've been through it all, she won't trust any person lightly.
Whether it's a maid or a guard, it's the same.
If you can't become her guard this time, then it'll be difficult to get close to her thereafter.
Is it just this one opportunity?
Even if you were lucky to be a guard, things won't get easier.
If you ever hesitate, then it'll be difficult to get the Queen to trust you.
You there, stand still... or die.
He's someone who fits Your Majesty's conditions.
If necessary, he will die on Your Majesty's behalf.
Who is the younger brother?
Me.
Did you test me?
That is enough, let's go.
The hidden danger is that people hate him.
His dissatisfaction with the Royal Family is very deep.
He barely survived all these years.
Fortunately, you can count on people like me.
How can you be so calm?
Don't you know the people's dissatisfaction is greater by the day?
I am sorry.
What about Geom Cheon?
He is in a secret hide-out near the capital.
Also, we moved his family in a safe house.
You have no reason to worry anymore.
He has to stay hidden until things cool down.
If he is caught, we'll all be in trouble.
Justkillhim.
How can you cover up such a criminal?
For our family... no, for our country, he is nothing but a shame.
Queen.
Killing him does not mean solving the problem.
Then what is the solution?
Only by killing him and closing his mouth we solve the problem for good.
Where is that person now?
NaesinJwapyeong!
Tell me now.
Where is that person?
That...
Thatis...
Any news from the people at the South Gate?
We couldn't find him, though we searched everywhere.
Also, we saw no suspicious persons.
What about you?
I couldn't find (him)either.
You too?
Aigoo.
Why do you eat food?
Do some work that will cover your food cost.
Why aren't they here, those sent to the North Gate?
Yesterday we had a lead, so I went to check the information.
It is him alright.
Are you sure?
The others can continue to eat.
Let's go.
There are a lot of people waiting for you.
You're taking me for another person.
You're not coming?
Shall I not say it with words?
Where is the new monk?
He was taken away while having his food this morning.
The cause of the captives riot the other day was because of him?
I heard he had on manyoccasions committed corruption.
Is he the one who took all the money?
He must have given some of it to his superiors!
Hey!
Ministers are all corrupt people!
We'd better kill him!
Take him to the prison immediately!
What did you just say?
Geom Cheon was arrested by the Minister of Justice?
Yes, Your Majesty...
He was caught by the people and handed over.
Dae Jwa Pyeong.
Where are Dae Jwa Pyeong and Nae Sin Jwa Pyeong?
Both have entered the palace, they're at the imperial court.
Stop!
Your Excellency, save me.
If you cooperate with us,
I'll spare your life.
- Guard him well.
- Yes!
There were cases when witnesses were murdered, were they not?
Yes.
You must have recorded the bribes you received.
There must be a list of names.
Where did you put it?
There must be a few people who want you dead.
Imagine I transfer away all the soldiers guarding you...
I also reported this matter to to His Majesty.
We know there is a ledger and a list of names, but we still have to know those names.
Geom Cheon will talk only if we guarantee his life will not be in danger, after giving away his accomplices' names.
These are his conditions.
How can you negotiate with a criminal?
I told him we will protect him if he tells us everything, but he is still scared.
He is so scared he might die...
I understand.
You may leave.
Yes.
What is the best thing to do now?
I am sorry, Your Majesty, but things got really complicated.
I'm not asking that.
Is it possible... that Father was involved too?
I know you could find out, even if I don't tell you this.
I am sorry.
Tell me what you are thinking.
I have something I want to show you.
It is a kite... used to ask people to support the rioters.
I already saw one, when Naesin Jwapyeong broght it to us.
Your Majesty.
This is the people's will.
When I first saw this kite, I don't know why, but I found it so beautiful...
Honestly when I learned this, I cried.
Such a beautiful kite, turned into such a terrible menace.
It is frightening.
Your Highness.
Because of those rioters, people complain about ministers and Your Majesty.
They all turned to the king now.
This is the harsh reality.
How could such a thing happen?
Majesty, please don't get angry with Father now.
We need to fnd a way to save him from this situation.
This is what we should do.
There is only one method.
We have to kill that person.
That way the peasants will get some relief..
Hyo So, are you there?
Call for Sing Hee.
Isn't he your new bodyguard?
We'd better use a more experienced one.
No.
He's a trustworthy child.
Were you looking for me?
You said you wanted to be one of my people.
Do you still want it?
Yes, by all means.
Good.
I have the first job for you.
You have someone to kill.
Please, give the order.
Who is it?
He is...
Thank you for watching with us!
SRT softsub created by haixuixui on:

You!
Stand still, or die.
He's the type of person you're looking for.
He is willing to die for you.
How can you hide such a criminal?
Where is he now?
Hurry up and let's go.There are a lot of people waiting for you.
The peasants directly captured him and handed him over to the officials.
Have you called for me?
You said you wanted to become my person.
Do you still want it?
Yes, of course.
Fine.
I am giving you your first job.
There is a person you have to kill.
Please, give the order.
Who do you want killed?
Episode 15
The person being held in the prison, do you mean that person?
That is so.
You cannot fail.
If you fail and are captured, you must kill yourself on the spot.
If you succeed, I'll take you in as my personal guard.
I accept your order.
Do you think you can do it?
It is heavily guarded and they are more alert than usual, given the situation.
I should give it a try.
Is there any way for me to help you?
Not helping me is a way to help.
We have to pretend not to know each other.
Even talking to me now is a mistake.
I know, but I am worried too.
This is just the beginning.
There will be more obstacles to overcome in the future.
If you are worried over this little thing, you'll make my work even more difficult.
Trust me.
I understand.
When Sing Hee kills that man, all the guards will head in that direction.
You have to take advantage of the situation and get the ledger.
Bring it back to me.
If Sing Hee gets stuck there, shouldn't we try to save him?
All you have to do is find and get the ledger, nothing else matters.
He is nothing but a decoy, meant to distract the guards' attention.
Whether he saves himself from that spot or not is not important.
I understand.
Is everything alright?
Yes.
Without my permission, nobody is allowed to enter this place.
- Be very careful!
- Yes!
Sing Hee did not try to break into prison, he observed and then retreated.
I think he was not confident enough to fulfill the task.
Otherwise we could have killed Geom Cheon and found the ledger.
Was I wrong about him?
He didn't look like a coward.
SingHee,YourMajesty'sbodyguard,isasking foranaudience .
Tell him to enter.
Why did you come?
Geom Cheon is not in that prison.
He is not there?
What do you mean by that?
Is it not fear that drove you back?
Why would I be afraid?
Security is too lax.
It doesn't look like a place already holding prisoners, rather a place expecting prisoners.
Were I to break in, I would have walked right into their trap.
Then where is he?
That, I do not know.
But if I were in their place, I would keep him safe somewhere outside the city walls.
They will have to move him at a certain moment.
All we have to do is wait.
It seems you are not an impulsive person, and you have great observation skills.
Leave me.
Yes.
He still refuses to give us the list of names.
How powerful are the ones on that list, to frighten him to such extent?
In fact, I have a suspect.
Who is it?
3 years ago, when Geom Cheon was exiled, Naesin Jwapyeong helped him get reinstated.
Isn't Naesin Jwapyeong the subordinate of the Prime Minster?
Is the Prime Minister involved, too?
It is what I think too.
But, until the investigation is finalized, we should refrain from speculating.
It seems Your Majesty would have to give up the death sentence, in his case.
Where is he now?
In a cave, outside the city.
What about the ledger?
Well... the ledger is hidden in a nearby temple.
Bring him here.
I want to interrogate him myself.
If he tells the truth, he will live.
Right.
Your Majesty should tell him clearly this.
Small fish are not important.
We have to capture the leader.
For sure it will be done that way.
I'll give you the newly appointed guards.
Guard him with your own life.
Yes, Your Highness.
Now,whichof thethreeisGeomCheon?
Assassins!
Catch him!
Go.
Catchhim!
Archers!
Shoot!
Catch him!
You did a good job.
But how did you know the one in the middle was Geom Cheon?
How could you tell the difference?
I wanted to kill all three prisoners.
Yes, but in that case, it would have lasted too long and the surprise element would have been gone.
Anyway, not a bad fellow...
Leave me.
Yes.
So, Geom Cheon died and you lost the ledger, didn't you?
I am sorry.
We planned everything so carefully, and now everything is gone.
We two were the only persons who knew Geom Cheon was in the middle.
Your Majesty, I didn't talk to anyone about this matter.
I am not afraid of death and I swear on my honor!
Then, we have no means to unroot corruption?
What is certain is that the Prime Minister was involved in Geom Cheon's being reinstated.
A full investigation will bring this to light, Your Majesty.
You are alright, aren't you?
Yes.
I was worried about you.
You did a good job.
But how did you know Geom Cheon was the one in the middle?
It was pure luck.
I know you did not rely on luck alone.
Just tell me, don't be so humble.
In fact, I was quite confused, when I saw them.
But, after carefully observing them, I noticed some subtle differences between them.
Subtle differences?
It was the way they walked.
Both the man in front and the one at the back walked at a steady, normal pace.
Their walk looked comfortable.
But the second prisoner did not walk comfortably.
He was not sure where he was being dragged off to.
The uncertainty was due to not knowing what was going to happen to him.
It wasn't definite proof but I bet everything on that deduction.
I've gotten myself a very capable personal guard.
Is there any particular reward that you would like?
Yes.
What is it?
Please give me the opportunity to serve you to the end.
Whose end are you referring to?
Of course, my end.
Your ingenious loyalty is my favorite, despite your stunning skills in martial arts.
Itsn't that right?
It is Your Majesty's good fortune.
From now on you will protect me.
It's an honor, Your Majesty.
There was an opportunity to save him.
There was no need to kill him.
What are you saying now?
!
You can live because he has died.
And even I don't know who killed him.
There should be no secrets between you and me, Prime Minister.
You.
Anyway it is done so it is a relief.
It is not done yet.
Your Majesty, I am sorry I caused so much trouble.
Sorry?
Geom Cheon is dead, but we are still in trouble, because of your involvment in his being reinstated.
Besides, they will find out you received bribes.
Please, don't worry.
Whatever happens to me in prison, I shall not break.
I won't say anything.
How is that?
Considering you corrupted the officials...
With this incident, the peasants won't believe the royalty.
I really have no excuse.
Shall I just withdraw to a far off place for a length of time?
I will follow whatever order you give.
Do you think that by doing so people will forget their grievance?
Just kill yourself.
Your Highness.
Geom Cheon, our witness in this corruption case, was killed.
The ledger dissapeared too.
Those who did this are Geom Cheon's accomplices.
They must be here today.
If you confess now, your lives will be spared.
But if you are found guilty later on, your families will pay too for your crimes.
Naesin Jwapyeong, is it you?
Your majesty, it's not that.
Though I do not know who killed Geom Cheon, the person responsible for this corruption matter is
Dae Jeong Pu.
Naesin Jwapyeong, how dare you?
!
Such nonsense!
Really, Dae Jwapyeong?
They all bribed you, including the officials working with Geom Cheon.
I guess the Foreign Affairs Minister was not the only one who bribed you, the other 6 ministers did it too.
Naesin Jwapyeong!
Are you out of your mind?
Do you have any evidence?
Do you think someone like the Prime Minister would leave behind any evidence?
But I am well aware of all the rumors.
Those investigating this matter were quite clear about it, were they not?
Majesty, your servant is innocent!
I never took any bribe.
This is a set up.
Is that so?
If you have been wrongly accused, Naesin Jwapyeong will be punished.
But, in order to find out the truth, we have to start an investigation.
Your Highness.
Naesin Jwapyeong!
Naesin Jwapyeong!
Why did you accuse the Prime Minister?
Why did you do it?
Don't you know the Prime Minister is the leader of the nobles?
If you betray him, you betray all of us.
Don't you think you will pay a heavy price for betraying us all?
Do you think I did it with no reason?
You all know very well how loyal I am to the Sa Taek family!
But to me, he said to kill myself.
I was willing to take the blame for him and go into exile.
And now... is this the price I have to pay for being loyal to them?
If you don't want to end up like me, you should come to your senses.
Please tell us.
Is it true that those officials offered money as bribe?
Don't just sit there, say something.
Have we misjudged you?
And did you tell Naesin Jwapyong to kill himself?
Don't you trust me anymore?
I've never taken any bribe.
You've followed me for so long.
Do you really not believe the queen and me?
I understand.
You are so firm on your position...
I shall never believe what others say.
I will believe in you.
You two, should not suspect him any more.
You should believe and support him.
What a surprise!
He turned around an bit the hand of the Prime Minister!
Due to the corruption case, the Sa Taek family pushed Gim Il on the edge of the cliff.
A dog doesn't bite its owner without a good reason.
Do you think the Queen and Jeok Deok are going to kill Gim Il?
Gim Il must know their intentions.
He will take all necessary precautions.
The problem is getting more interesting.
The nobles will be finally divided, not sharing the same opinion anymore.
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Are you okay?
What shame... what shame our family has to endure...
That Gim Il...
Gim Il... what a disgrace...!
Sing Hee, are you outside?
You called for me, Your Highness?
You need to do something.
Please, give your order.
There is a conflict among the nobles.
God is helping us.
Go and give a warning to Gim Il, as the Queen ordered.
The queen is currently mistaken.
If Gim Il is injured, things will be even more difficult for the Sa Taek family.
I understand.
You can't get hurt.
Do you mean until the good day arrives?
What?
Who are you?
InHisExcellency'sroom!
This...
This is Sa Taek family's doing.
I cannot trust them anymore.
I feel the same way.
I heard an assassin broke into Gim Il's home last night.
I heard that, too.
Nevertheless, I don't think you are involved in this incident, Prime Minister.
It doesn't matter what people think, it is all due to my inefficiency.
I will withdraw.
The investigation hasn't begun yet.
Don't you react too soon?
Even if there is an investigation, for the sake of transparency and fairness, I have to resign.
There's nothing I can do if that's your attitude.
I was the cause of so much trouble for the royal family.
I am really very sorry.
Prince.
I just heard
Dae Ja Pyong has withdrawn.
Is that true?
It is.
Maybe it is because he tried to assassinate Naesin Jwapyeong.
The king may call for you.
He won't leave the Dae Jwapyong position empty during this turmoil.
Then it would be your duty to conduct the investigation.
You have to prepare thoroughly.
Father, I'm scared and nervous.
I wish you wouldn't get involved in this turmoil.
Madame, how can you say that?
This could be a good opportunity for father and myself.
Even so, you have to be careful.
Yes, I know.
I'll think about it carefully, so don't worry.
I heard you accepted the Prime Minister's resignation.
I only accepted Dae Jwapyong's intentions.
If he is innocent, what is the problem?
He will be reinstated as soon as he is proven not guilty.
Of course that is how it is.
But the investigation process must be correct.
If only one person conducts the investigation, it would be very difficult for that person.
I want to appoint Yeon Mun Jin as Prime Minister.
He will conduct the investigation.
He is a highlty respected and honest person.
His decision will be accepted by everyone.
Isn't that so, My Queen?
I'lltakethisopportunitytoclean theCourt, thenoblesandallof the officials.
Idon'tthinkthe PrimeMinisterisguilty ,butifheis, heshouldbe preparedtodie.
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Mother.
Queen.
How is the queen?
I am sorry Your Highness.
I don't know yet.
Right now, I'm thinking that it may be due to a big emotional shock.
Mother...
What exactly is wrong?
Please, come to your senses, mother.
Mother.
It doesn't seem to be a serious illness but the queen collapsing like that can cause a big problem.
It is really bad.
For the royal family it is a disaster.
What do you think about this situation?
I want to reinstate you as Prime Minister.
I retired a long time ago...
I don't know if I can be of benefit.
I want you to conduct a thorough investigation of the Sa Taek family.
Until things are cleared up.
Well, let me see.
It is a very important matter.
I don't know if I should take on this job.
It is the perfect opportunity to bring down the Sa Taek family.
It's turning out well.
The Sa Taek family received a devastating blow.
We can finally get rid of the Sa Taek family.
Of course, it is possible.
But, is there something else you would like to do, besides bringing down the Sa Taek family?
Are you thinking of bringing down the queen, too?
Yes.
The king will join us in this effort.
Who knows when another opportunity will arise?
I know it is a good opportunity, but aren't you rushing things a bit?
Prince,
I've come this far dreaming of this opportunity.
I was waiting for this day, when I told my family to trust me, to follow me, as I brought into my home a dragon as my son-in-law.
This is what I was waiting for.
It is the perfect opportunity to destroy Sa Taek family.
This is when we can start afresh.
You have to make a decision, Your Highness.
Yeon Mun Jin Dae Jwapyeong wants to take this opportunity and bring down the Sa Taek family.
He also intends to bring down the Queen.
More over, he wants to convince His Majesty to change the system and get rid of Sa Taek and all the nobles who follow him.
Any other thoughts?
Ah really!
In the end this old man shows his true colours.
It seems like a good opportunity.
I agree with you.
A fleeting moment in a thousand years. (the opportunity of a life time).
It is our occasion to bring down Sa Taek, the leader of the noble families.
We won't get this chance again will we?
This seems to be the situation.
What makes you say this?
What can I say?
It is an intuition I have now.
Intuition?
Which is also known as sixth sense, or feeling.
That's really what I think as well.
It may sound ridiculous, but I've been doing things according to my intuition for a long time.
Your Highness has endured this for far too long.
Since you've waited for so long, it may be that when the time comes to act, you're now reluctant to do so.
What do you think?
You have to let the Prince know what you think, only then can he make up his mind.
It's not easy to make a decision.
What I'm saying is that you, agassi, will have to expose your true self before the Queen.
I'm ready for that.
I am uneasy.
I'm afraid I may fail to protect you.
It's not just for revenge that I'm standing here.
It's because I want to protect the person I love, and... for that fine day in the future.
That's why I'm standing here.
Until I make sure I can protect you... agassi, I can't make my decision.
Just give me a little bit more time.
It looks just like a painting.
What's this about a good country or a bad country?
It would be good if a beautiful woman were to appear before my eyes now.
You've not looked at yourself in a mirror.
With your kind of looks, even if a woman should appear, she would take flight.
Have you finished talking?
No.
If you dream about women, ask Yeon Mun Jin to bring you a woman slave.
The way you behave, no woman would ever come looking for you.
If I were to get married, the first thing to be done would be throwing away my pride.
This is out of the question!
Look here, Seong Chung!
Do you really believe that once the Sa Taek family is out of the picture, things will settle down?
Once the tiger is removed, the wolf becomes the next king.
In fact, we just replace the Sa Taek family with Yeon Mun Jin's family.
This is what we do...
You think the same too yes?
Such an action needs extensive and careful preparation.
First, he has to be acknowledged by those nobles who did not support Sa Taek.
Then, he needs His Majesty's support.
If things go wrong, he will be the first to go down, so we must be prepared.
Yeon Mun Jin... that snake lying hidden in the grass... that old man.
He already concluded a deal with His Majesty, or he wouldn't have come out so easily.
Even if we succeed, there will be many other matters to be settled.
I need to ponder over this matter with utmost caution.
I am here to see Her Majesty.
Her Majesty is not feeling wel.
That is exactly why I am here.
You!
I didn't say you could enter her chambers.
Let him come in.
I know him.
Make way.
I don't know when mother willcome to her senses.
From now on you will obey me as you obeyed my mother.
From this moment on
I am your master.
Once a master, always a master.
The sunflower that follows the sun does not bow its head only because the sun is hidden by a mere cloud.
Did you discover the Wi Je headquarters?
They came because they didn't receive orders, as the Queen is currently ill.
This is a very good opportunity.
If we successfully eliminate the Wi Je Group, even if Sa Taek family rises again, the dissolution of the Wi Je Group will be a terrible blow.
I shall destroy them.
Can you do it?
They killed my mother.
Also, they are the Queen's loyal servants.
I will wipe them out.
You need a poison powerful enough to kill hundreds of people?
Yes, ahjusshi.
I've known about Wi Je Group for a long time.
They are assassins serving the Sa Taek family and they have killed many innocent people.
Getting rid of them would be a precious opportunity.
You have to find a way.
Poison that can kill hundreds of people...
It's a difficult problem but who am I?
I am Im Ja, king of poison!
I'll find a way!
Therearemanywaystoproducepoison ,butthe mostefficientoneis to burn this cinnabar.
First,itwasusedasmedicine,but whenithitsfire,itreleasesapoison.
This one here looks like ordinary coal, but it has some very special properties.
When you burn it, it releases a fatal smoke.
This is a special, imported oil.
As it can catch fire, it is called kerosene.
It is more inflammable than normal oil.
How is it?
Will it be enough?
It is enough Ahjusshi.
Thank you.
You're very useful.
That is why I've never cried over all the money I gave you.
If I'm allowed to travel again, I can be even more helpful.
How is it?
So, you'd better give me some more money...
Do you want to run away to play?
I don't deserve such words...
If we want to eliminate Wi Je Group, we need the help of the rioters, too.
They have to risk their lives.
But, if we succeed, many innocent lives could be saved.
I'll do it.
I'll convince the guys to join me.
Don't reply so quickly.
You have to put your life on the line.
If that is the condition to eliminate the assassins who serve the Sa Taek family,
I'll do it!
My comrades died because of them!
My mother and my brother also died because of them!
You are not the only people in pain.
Those who had to leave their homes all feel the same.
Their lives have been robbed.
They will all regard this as a mission.
A family that rises by walking on innocent blood, will have to pay with blood for all the wrongdoings.
There must be a lot of pleople who hold grudges against the Sa Taek family and would consider this as a mission from heaven.
But if this continues, things will get worse.
The Sa Taek family has held onto power for too long.
They have misused their power and corrupted Baekje.
We can reduce the risk if we convince people that such a mission is just.
I'm begging you then.
It may be dangerous, but please gather the people who will join in this fight.
Everybody has gathered.
At sunrise, we're going to leave.
Be careful.
If I agree, it means rebelion.
Please consider that it is time I make that decision.
Please, do as you planned.
Gye Baek.
The feeling Your Highness talked about...
I know it too well.
I have been in the battle zone for a long time.
My feelings and my perceptions changed so many times.
What I feel now...is that we must be extremely careful.
Something that we don't expect could be waiting for us.
If we continue to wait and ponder, we may lose our opportunity.
If we don't decide now, we may lose everything and have nothing in the future.
Once you make your decision, please don't doubt yourself.
Throw away your worry and nervousness.
Look forward and continue on.
I will do it that way.
Would you do the same, Your Highness?
Are you saying that you can't do it?
It seems that rumors about you are all wrong.
Are you from the palace?
You don't need to know.
Hey, hey, hey.
Wait.
When it comes to management, I'm the one you should talk with.
This guy is the fighter.
He doesn't know how to negotiate.
So, deal with me, with me.
Move.
Hey!
Oh my.
Ah you!
This guy.
Just because you're from the palace, do you think it's okay to push people around?
Just look at you!
What a poor disguise!
When you have to do a job, do it properly!
I'm talking to you, scoundrel!
You jerk...
You...
You are an official who came here incognito.
Do you want to die?
"Want to die?"
Look at the way this young one talks.
This, really?
You...
Do you think it is enough to have power and influence?
Fine.
Are you a senior official?
Looking at you, it seems rather impossible.
Gyo Gi.
Gyo Gi?
Oh!
Is there an official named Gyo Gi?
This is the first time hearing this.
Perhaps it's go-gi (meat)?
Maybe.
If you say Gyo Gi, then our 2nd prince is Gyo Gi...
Wait... then...
Maybe you...
You're not Prince Gyo Gi, are you?
It's the prince.
What are you guys doing?
Let's get out of here.
We might have another deal.
Do you know about Wi Je Group?
If you tell me, then I will do whatever you wish.
Why do you want to know that?
I have a debt to pay back.
Debt?
You're not worried about dying.
It's a debt important enough to bet my life on.
Say it.
What do you want to know?
I want to know the location of their headquarters.
You're really brave guys.
ThosefromWi Je Group... don't fear danger.
Theyfollowtheirfaith.
Andourfaith... goesonlyto ourQueen.
My body does not belong only to me.
Okay.
Give it a try.
If you get rid of all those guys, I'll take you in.
Please, look.
I was right.
As it is written here...
The Royal Hospital, Personnel and the Historical department...
Palace Affairs, Topography... 22 government departments in all.
Do they report to you only?
Each departmental chief has provided a hand-written confession.
They have always looked for your approval, excepting all of your schemes, although most of them have refused to give a written confession.
But he has already pocketed a very large amount.
Jo Jeong Jwapyeong, those confessions are clear evidence.
How do you explain this?
Why do you make me say the same thing over again?
This is defamation.
I am not even familiar with those persons.
As you can see, all these are allegations against Sa Taek Jeok Deok.
Just relying on these, we can convict Sa Taek Jeok Deok.
That Naesin Jwapyeong who usually follows behind Jeok Deok Sa Taek, has now betrayed him.
I'm really surprised.
Tomorrow, make an immediate announcement, and execute him.
Forgive your servant's audacity, your servant hopes that Your Majesty will not forget how General Mu Jin died.
First, we must separate the Queen from Sa Taek Jeok Deok.
After ensuring Your Majesty's safety, then we'll publicize what we're going to do.
If we don't do this, that side will try to influence the nobles again.
They might even retaliate using their military might.
Then what can we do?
Make sure Her Majesty continues to recuperate.
Sa Taek Jeok Deok is already a spent force.
Your Majesty, even if the Sa Taek family mobilizes their military force, if we take control of the palace and the capital city first, whatever action they take, they'll be a step behind.
To gain control of the palace and capital, we must first take control of the ministries and royal guards.
Presently, my son is at the ministries and royal guard division, trying to persuade them.
Therefore, right after dawn tomorrow, Your Majesty should use the excuse that the palace is undergoing repairs and move to a safe place.
Once Your Majesty has reached the safe place, we will immediately begin our insurrection.
Because there are still many noblemen who'll side with the Sa Taek family, even if the insurrection does not bring us what we wish for, it will at least ensure Your Majesty's safety.
They had in their cruel hands two thorns that were so very painful for us.
Nobles have always feared them.
But now the situation has reversed.
Your Majesty.
In my heart, Your Majesty, you have become the powerful king of Baekje.
You are the true king of Baekje.
I told you already... it was mutually decided that I would not accompany you!
My arms are hurting!
What's going on?
We're under attack!
Because of the toxic smoke, our men fainted.
Careful!
Hold your breath till you are out of here!
Yes.
Why are you so mean?
Do I belong to you, by chance?
What is that?
It looks like there was a fight.
Something happened to the Wi Je Group.
It seems others have arrived before us.
Aigoo!
We are late again!
Bul Hae let's retreat.They're probably dead.
Ah really.
Bul Hae, I'm begging you.
You should give up searching for revenge.
This is not good for you mental state.
Look at me.
Me too, because of the Wi Je people, I was consumed by the desire to get revenge.
After I let go of all my thoughts of revenge, look at my skin...
It's nice and smooth.
And do you see any gray hair?
You don't see any.
I used to have lots of gray hair but after letting go of all thoughts of revenge, all the gray hairs fell out and dark hair grew back in.
So what I'm saying is completely right.
Bul Hae, let's cancel this.
Everyone, we're going back!
Retreat!
One more word and you will really die.
Hurry up!
Go!
Am I bleeding?
A little bit.
Who are they?
I'm not sure, but they don't seem to come from the palace.
What's going on?
Ah, what is this?
Watch carefully.
The guys in black... those are the enemy.
Just kill the ones in black.
Take out your sword.
You, too.
Now get going.
Hey Il Yee,
I think the leader has just escaped.
I don't see him.
I don't know who you are but thank you for helping.
You have erased all our efforts.
Who are you?
Your words are crude.
So what if I'm crude?
Then I'd become crude, too.
Thank you for watching with us!

Episode 16
Hey Il Yee.
I think the leader has just escaped.
I don't know who you are, but thank you for helping.
You have erased all our efforts.
Who the heck are you?
Your words are crude.
So what if I'm crude?
I would become crude, too.
Do you want me to send you to heaven?
What if I am the one sending you to heaven?
Don't ever swing a sword at my pray!
Or...you'll become my pray too.
Get lost.
I think I've seen him before.
And where could you have seen him before...
We saw him fighting from the beginning.
Also, we all, not just you, should recognize him since we always go around together.
Let's go...fast.
So, let's drink till the night is over!
I feel great sharing wine with you.
It seems that tomorrow, the new rising sun will find us together, like this.
What do you mean by that?
I'd say Sa Taek has lost the support of the people.
Don't you agree?
Dae Jwapyeong's corruption has been revealed.
Dae Jwapyeong is innocent.
All they have are some groundless rumors.
Do you mean all officials who gave written depositions were lying?
!
It must be the work of that Naesin Jwapyeong.
So, are you not going to greet the new rising sun in our company?
Is this the truth?
Is this the meaning of our drinking wine tonight?
You heard what I said.
Why do you stand up now?
I'll pretend I didn't hear anything I heard tonight.
Would that erase from your memory all that you heard?
What is this supposed to mean?
!
For now, spend one night here.
During this time, I won't trouble you any further.
Hey!
Quickly!
You, guys!
Open the door!
Did it go as planned?
As expected, he refused.
But I had him locked up.
However, the other one is on our side and he will do as we wish.
Royal guards and the other departments are already in our grasp.
So, there is nothing to worry about.
We made all arrangements for tomorrow morning.
His Majesty will leave the palace because of the repairs going on.
This would be the signal.
The two Jwapyeongs will mobilize their soldiers.
What would we do after gaining control over the city?
The very first thing is to get rid of JeoK Deok.
If we spare the enemy, this is our death sentence.
The same goes for the queen.
If we let the queen live, we won't be able to convince the nobles to come to our side.
Father, I am really scared.
Tae Yeon.
Have you forgotten you will be queen?
You have to be strong.
Even if the king would not be a good husband, you have to give birth to a child.
And a son will be the future Prince.
The mother of the prince will be honored and respected.
So, our family will prosper.
What happened?
This is a golden opportunity for us.
Sa Taek's guilt has been proven and the nobles turned against him.
Moreover, the Queen is sick, unable to take any measures.
People in the village agreed to help us.
Don't you think it is too easy?
But we planned everything after talking things over with you.
I don't like it.
I don't like any of it.
We depend on others to succeed.
A mountain without tigers still have wolves as kings.
Are you afraid the Yeon family will become another Sa Taek family?
When I become king, it definitely won't happen again.
I shall cut the nobles' privileges and I shall make a better life for the people.
We don't know this.
When a person gets to the throne, the person changes.
Trust me and trust Yeon Mun.
Yeon and I, we shall govern the country like Sa Taek never did.
A green apple turned red, does it change the taste?
Once the power is in grasp, the color of the apple has no significance whatsoever!
So, don't you trust His Highness with his dream to make Baekje like this village?
Then why did you agree to work with the prince?
Because I believed in him.
He said the right things.
Then let me ask one thing.
If you succeed, would you give up the Yeon family and all the other nobles?
I know your heart is heavy.
But the dice have been cast.
You have to stay strong.
Eun Go.
In case...
I'm saying just in case tomorrow doesn't go well...
Your Highness...
You must live.
Even if you have to leave Baekje with Gye Baek, you have to survive.
What are you saying?
Didn't you say we shared the same life?
To live or to die, I will do it with you.
Just because we have the same goal, it doesn't mean we have to die together.
Your Highness.
We are so close to our goal, how can you be so weak?
It's because I don't want to lose you.
Also, what about Gye Baek who only lives for you?
TheQueenis so shrewed.
She musthave anaceup her sleeve .
Evena stonebridgecan beknockeddown.
You go ahead first.
I have something to verify at the palace.
Take care of her well.
-Let's go.
-Alright.
We're going!
Welcome Your Excellency!
We are waiting.
Is His Majesty on the road already?
We are waiting for the messenger.
Nice.
We will start off.
Go inform Dae Jwapyeong Mun Jin.
Find out how things go and come back to report.
Yes, Your Highness.
Alliancebetween:
Ui Ja ,YeonMun Jin ,YeonTaeGyeon ,BaekEun,SinGuk.
Let's go.
How did it go?
The leaders fled, but we destroyed completely their headquarters.
Gye Baek accomplished a big feat.
Fine, now we have to move too.
His Majesty left the palace.
We go and take control over the palace and you go at Sa Taek's headquarters.
Understood.
We're leaving!
Now,thatHisMajestyleft thepalace, theywillrushhere,notknowingwesetthetrap.
Ui Ja will come too.
A relief isn't it?
All this thanks to the Queen's ingenious trick.
Itisnotagood idea toletNaesin Jwapyeongcommitsuicide.
Wecannotlethim die for the sakeofSa Taekfamily ,afterserving usfaifthfullyforsomany years!

Andthatnewmaster... willtryto replaceus.

Right.
AndUi Ja willbeinvolvedtoo.
Thus,wecanget rid ofthem all.
Whata cleverstrategy!
This is something only you and I should know.
Don'tdoit !
DaeJwapyeong!
I'veneverdoubtedyourloyalty!
Now...theonewho deservestodieis not you.
I am the one who should die.
You have to attack me like a madman!
You were right, they jumped to such a perfect occasion!
Since the king has left the palace, the traitors will now launch a massive attack.
Get moving quickly.
We're ready with everything.
We've already placed all 50,000 soldiers in various places.
All their soldiers added up are less than a thousand.
We have 50,000 soldiers.
We can predict the outcome.
We'll have to hurry up.
Yes.
It's Gye Baek.
It's a trap.
We can't go to the capital.
What are you talking about?
What trap?
The Queen is safe and unharmed.
I just saw Gim Il and Jeok Deok together.
The Queen being sick, Gim Il's betrayal, Jeok Deok's resignation, were to lead us into their trap.
Go back to the village and wait for me.
I'm going to inform Yeon Mun Jin and his soldiers to turn back.
They're the soldiers from the general department.
What is Ui Ja doing?
He should be coming very soon... let's go in quickly.
Shut the gate.
It's a success, Dae Jwapyeong!
We didn't have to shed any blood coming in.
Hurry and capture the queen.
Yes, Father.
Were you looking for me?
Why is Naesin Jwapyeong standing there?
Capture the queen!
Yes!
Exactly... where did all these soldiers...
Where did they come from?
All this is...
All this is your trap?
Our god is abandoning us.
Search thoroughly!
We didn't find his daughter.
She must be hiding.
-Search thoroughly!
-Yes.
It's a trap?
What happened with Ui Ja?
Thankfully, he wasn't in the Palace.
They've really fallen into our trap this time.
It's really incredible.
Other than you, who would think of such a plot?
Didn't you, when I collapsed, force Gwi Un to be loyal to you?
That's because I wanted to carry on with the Wi Je faction.
Forget it.
It is done.
But I wonder why Ui Ja didn't make an appearance.
He avoided the plot but he will definitely show up.
We must find the alliance record.
Ui Ja's name will be in there.
I understand.
Your Highness, you are up.
I heard there was some commotion in the Palace.
Are you all right?
Yes, I'm fine.
You weren't in our residence, where did you go?
Your Majesty collapsed after father's resignation.
I wanted to go to the temple and pray.
If you still didn't wake up after that, who else can I follow?
To be able to see you so healthy, I am so happy.
Dry your tears.
I won't collapse that easily.
Didn't you leave?
I thought you went with the king.
I accompanied His Majesty out of the city and came back.
I'm Your Majesty's subordinate.
Come with me.
Yes.
Dae Jwapyeong... how do you feel about the revolt failing?
Not too bad.
I can't even hold a sword properly now.
Rather than living like a dog, it would be better to die.
Is that so?
The way I see it, you're not that bad off.
I was worried that you would beg to save your life.
That spirit of yours is such a pity.
Who were your accomplices in this revolt against the royal family?
If you're candid, I may spare your life.
Was it Ui Ja?
Ui Ja?
Ha!
Queen Sa Taek,
I want to become king!
I wanted to bring down this palace.
Who else could have done so?
It is shameless.
I want to bring down Baekje and make the Yeon family the masters.
No, my Queen.
It's Prince Ui Ja, he wanted to join us.
Your servant heard them talk about it.
Look here Naedu Jwapyeong!
What nonsense are you saying?
Aren't you embarrassed?
It's bad enough that I lost my sister to that guy.
It's enough that we got caught, why are you trying to drag others in this mess too?
Don't degrade yourself.
Die like a man.
Isn't that right Byeonggwan Jwapyeong?
!
We found it at the Yeons.
King
- YounMunJin ;
Prince
-YounTaeGyeon;
DaeJwapyoung
-BaekRang .
Your preparations were so careful.
They're not going to talk.
I will kill all those people.
You will withdraw.
Sing Hee.
Yes.
Send them off painlessly.
I recieved your order.
I have no regrets.
Just do it.
Your daughter is safe.
It's a nice day to die.
We shall remember you.
You will not be forgotten.
Your daughter... will be taken care of.
Go in peace.
We shall take care of your daughter from now on.

By my hand,
I killed him.
That person... gave up his life to save us all.
Like my father did in the old days.
How are we to go on living?
There's no time to sit around moping.
You and I have people to protect.
We have to rise on our feet again.
We have to find a way to get rid of them.
You've become stronger.
I lost everything.
But now I have something I want to protect.
I have to get stronger.
I will become stronger.
What?
You want to teach the people?
If we continue to rely on others, we'll never be able to reach our goals.
Of course that's true.
Then shouldn't we do this with our own strength?
Sure.
This isn't something that can be accomplished by moving words.
There aren't too many people in this camp.
If you total everyone, there isn't even 200.
It wasn't 200 from the beginning.
It became 200 after 1,2, 10, 20 people gathered together.
Also, it's possible the number could grow to 1,000 or 10,000.
You're reasoning is a bit strange, but what you say is true.
What do you want to do first?
We have to garner enough strength to protect ourselves.
First, each person needs to learn to protect himself.
Then we need to teach him how to survive.
You're an interesting fellow.
These are documents signed by the ministers who were threatened by Yeon Mun Jin.
Yeon Mun Jin threatened them all into writing those so-called confessions.
There is no need to go through that anymore.
I understand.
Also, we haven't located his escaped daughter.
I will find her and settle it.
What are you talking about?
You already killed his son.
Must you kill his daughter, too?
I understand why Your Majesty wants to protect her.
She is Ui Ja's wife.
No matter what crime Yeon Mun Jin committed, she is Ui Ja's wife.
She has already broken ties with them.
How can you link her to the criminals?
Her marriage with Ui Ja did not make her a member of the royal family.
What they have is just a personal relationship.
Yeon Tae Won is not a royal person.
Even so, she is now the prince's wife.
If you were going to be so keen on everything, then Ui Ja is a criminal, too.
What?
Do you mean Ui Ja has to give up his wife in order to live?
Ui Ja will do it.
Why can't Ui Ja be capable of doing what you already did?
Look here, queen!
Do you remember, Your Majesty?
Long ago,
I told you that I would slowly and painfully destroy everything you held dear.
I've never forgotten that promise.
Does that mean you haven't forgotten Mu Jin?
It's not only about that.
You tried to kill me.
You were in on the plot.
Did you just tell me to abandon my supporters?
That's your only way to survive.
I can't do that.
If I abandon those people, they are as good as dead.
Father-in-law, in order to save me, took all the blame and died.
My wife is all alone now.
How can I abandon a person like that?
You are a fool.
Then will you die, too?
Do you think I would be saying this if there was another way?
If you don't abandon your followers, you will die, too.
Did the queen say that?
She wants to kill you.
If you leave any bit of evidence, your life will be in danger.
I... would rather die with my supporters.
I'm different from you.
In order to survive, in order to rise to the throne,
I will not kill my supporters.
Fine.
You are different from me.
You would rather die in order to save the throne.
You are very different.
If dying is your wish, go ahead and die.
You clung onto your wretched life for so long.
Do you really want to die?
Are you saying you endured all those years of hardship so that you could die so easily?
You can't die.
Mu Jin and Yeon Moon Jin both died to save your life.
Are you going to turn their deaths into a waste?
You cannot die.
No.
It is impossible for you to die.
This is the most appropriate place.
Here, here and here.
Have you come, Your Highness?
We have to dig an underground tunnel.
We need some help.
Help me.
What should I do?
Gye Baek.
My life is not mine only.
General Mu Jin saved my life.
Sir Yeon Moon Jin also saved my life.
But,
I can't let others sacrifice themselves for me.
Sung Choon, Hee Sook, what shall I do?
I have to find a way for Yeon Tae Won to live.
Please, stand up.
What do you want to say?
Are you being sincere?
Stop!
I asked if you're being sincere?
I mean it sincerely.
I'm giving up everything and entering the monastery.
Baekje now has only one prince.
That's you, Gyo Gi.
What does that mean?
Queen, will it be okay now for my wife to live?
What was in the document for you to react like this?
It is a document signed by Guk Tong (Guk Tong was in charge of all monks in Baekje).
Ui Ja and Yun Tae Won have agreed to enter the temple.
He asks for my understanding.
Now, that you are here with me, they won't be able to harm you.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have brought you into this situation from the start.
No.
I was happy to be living with you.
Father and brother are the pitiful people.
The unhappiness and burden in my heart have all dissapeared, as if magically lifted.
Now, I'm the only prince of Baekje.
Those crafty people!
They had Guk Tong on their side, to be sheltered at the temple.
He had sworn to stay at the temple and never leave it.
If he returns to saecular life, Yeon Tae Won will die.
In order to protect his wife, Ui Ja left.
For now he can't think of reaching for the throne.
I can't understand it.
He endured every abuse in order to survive.
How could he leave?
I never knew Ui Ja would give up so easily.
What is it?
If I hadn't known you three, I may have just let Tae Won die.
Just like me surviving because Yeon Moon Jin died.
But,
I saw many things because you.
Through the tears and sufferings of the war prisoners I started to know Baekje people.
Only after coming here, I knew such a place could really exist.
Why should I live to become Baekje's king?
That's what I asked myself time and time again.
To avenge my mother's death and and to fulfill father-in-law's plan, I wanted so badly to destroy the Sa Taek family...
For that goal, I wanted to rise to the throne.
But, in my goal, there was nothing about the peasants.
This isn't just to save Yeon Tae Won.
I don't have the qualifications to become the peasant's king.
That's why I decided to leave the palace.
Prince.
Actually, I was testing you.
I was no longer going to help you if you let your wife die to save your royal position.
A person who can't protect his wife, how can he protect his followers?
Also, how can he protect the peasants?
In a corner of my heart, there was a conflict going on.
My father died to protect you.
My father valued you more than his own son.
I hated you for this.
But now I understand.
I know why my father chose you.
Instead of wanting Baekje for your pride's sake, you have to become the king for the peasants' sake.
You could have come out of this safely.
You could have abandoned your supporters.
But you didn't do that.
You say you don't have the qualifications to be king?
That's not so.
You have to become king for the good of Baekje.
From now on, my sword and heart will move for your sake.
Because you work for Baekje's benefit.
We're just three people, but will you lead us into the new world?
Are you dissatisfied because we're just three people?
As father protected you, I will now protect you.
You should promise too, that you will become king and make a new world with us.
Even if we were not born the same day...
We four, have now become brothers with a common goal.
Tell the king that his motherless son Ui Ja, has returned alive!
I, Ui Ja, lost my mother.
I survived due to General Moo Jin's efforts.
I am no longer lonely since I've acquired brothers.
Rather than for revenge, I will work for the sake of the peasants.
I'm not going to be scared for my life.
The four of us...
Whether we live or die, we will do this together.
I shall not become a tyrant.
I shall live or die with my people.
I, Seong Chung, here and now, embrace you as my sworn brothers.
I swear to work together with you, to bring to life our projects.
We shall not be craving for power, money, fame or status.
We shall focus only on Baekje's resurrection.
Even if I die in the flesh, my soul will always be with you.
I Hong Soo, had decided to live a comfortable life but after meeting you brothers, I've decided to become involved again.
Going against our beliefs is like going against our people's beliefs.
It is like betraying heaven.
So, we cannot sit and watch idly what's happening around us.
I Gye Baek, have lived aimlessly up to now.
From now on, I will walk along side my brothers.
Our path is the path to a new world.
This new world will be a world without regrets, without injustice.
A world without tears.
No revenge, no bloody feuds.
A world without orphans and refugees.
If there is an obstacle in our path, whether it is a mountain or the ocean, we will find a way to get past it.
If there is a brother who has collapsed from fatigue, I will carry him.
I will walk along side my brothers.
If that new world ever comes, I will go with my brothers and return to the village.
There at the well,
I will wash my bloodied sword.
I promise this.
I promise.
I promise.
I promise.
I know you are sad and you blame yourself.
However... there is still hope.
There's a place you have to go with me.
Grandmother.
The three stars that will protect Baekje have gathered.
While the first star is shining, no foreign enemy will be able to pass Dan Ueon.
When the second star lights up, armies will stop at Dan Yeon.
When the third star is shining, nobody will be able to harm Baekje.
Welcome.
To free ourselves from fate and people who make us suffer, it is not that difficult.
It bothers me that you have to live in such sparse and meager surroundings
It doesn't bother me.
Prince.
I think...
I'm pregnant.
If a monk has a baby, won't it cause trouble?
More than that, the queen won't leave the child alone.
Why are you saying that now?
I didn't have the chance to tell you.
Mother.
Please, help me.
This child must not be noticed by the opposition party.
He can't live like I did.
Please, help him avoid notice.
Please, help me, mother.
Ahjumma!
This year is plentiful.
Food is plentiful.
Labor is plentiful.
Good feelings, also plentiful.
Very plentiful.
All these people.
They really left their hometown because they lost their jobs and family.
I cannot believe it.
Isn't that so?
When you look at it, I'm really impressive.
I gather all these homeless people.
And make such a wonderful world.
Looking at them, I realize now that our people had forgotten how wonderful a smile is.
You've finally become a person.
We have no worries about food until next autumn.
If there is rice, there is hope.
If we can't feed those people, we can't say it's a good world or a good government.
More people keep moving in.
There are more then 1,000 already.
Your words came true.
When spring comes, I think we'll have to make the grounds bigger.
Sister, sister Joye!
Give us rice!
Hurry up!
Hurry and give it to us.
Me first!
Me first!
Do you want to play now?
What is it with those flowers?
!
Give it to me!
- Me too!
- Me too!
Has that girl always been mute?
Three years ago, during the war, she lost her parents.
She ran away with her little brother on her back.
When we found her, her brother was already dead, by arrow.
She cried for many days but after that there were no tears or words.
Maybe it's because of that, she is very good at looking after the children.
She stays in a cottage, that she shares with all orphan children.
To us, she's become indispensible.
These are the supplies sent by our ahgassi.
Please, relay my thanks.
Yes, Prince Ui Ja.
I'm monk Myung Jin.
Oh, where's my mind?
Yes, monk Myung Jin.
Is there anything that master Hye Dang would need?
No, there's still some remaining from what was given last time.
Then, I'll see you again next month.
Wait.
Can you bring me some seaweed?
What do you need seaweed?
I don't think you're going to give birth soon...?
!
Does the monk food not suit your tastes?
Before entering the temple, seaweed soup was my favorite dish.
So...
How can you eat such fishy food?
I will try to get some.
Are your wounds healed now?
Yes, Your Majesty.
I am sorry you worried for me.
We are not as many as before, but we managed to get things in order.
Have you still been unable to find the attackers?
I'm sorry.
How were they able to attack with such violence?
How did they find out about that place?
I still don't believe it.
There must be a spy inside Wi Je Group.
I've investigated.
I couldn't find any spies.
There are rumors in the street that Wi Je Group attacked innocent people.
They want to make people hate us and drive their anger towards us.
You don't need to be concerned.
What?
Pretending we are them, so that Wi Je Group could come looking for us themselves?
How much more do I have to wait?
Talk.
You keep telling me to talk and yet you squeeze my throat.
Let go and talk.
Let go.
You grasped me so tightly, my flesh is hurting.
Aren't we partners, after all?
We're on the same team.
If you keep being rough with your partner, it will be a bit awkward.
Aren't you being too much?
Oh, really.
Those two, the one-eyed guy and the other one.
They are the real enemies.
If those guys don't show up this month...
I'll finish you guys off first.
Know that I'll throw you away.
Get your knife.
What is it?
Why aren't you hurrying?
What are you doing?
Yes.
Oh, really.
Who are you?
The question is who are you?
Why are you trying to imitate the Wi Je Group?
This guy.
I'm going to go crazy.
I think there's a definite misunderstanding.
I wasn't looking for you.
There is another person, over there.
It doesn't matter to me.
I just have to hand you over.
It would be good if you released us now.
If you're caught by me later, you'll be dead.
You keep talking rudely.
I don't care if I die.
What I hate most is being talked to rudely.
You're that guy's kid.
You never learned manners.
Wi Je Group has sent the orders.
Were you perhaps working with Wee Jae Dang?
I'm not on the same team.
I was just imitating Wee Jae Dang.
You're the one who came looking for Wee Jae Dang.
Does that mean you're not Wee Jae Dang?
Then, what's with the writing on your shoulder?
This isn't a tattoo.
Move this aside for a minute.
I wrote it with a brush.
It's removable.
Look.
It's removable.
Look.
It vanishes cleanly.
Is this a tattoo?
What kind of tattoo rubs off?
Do it again.
Tomorrow is the day for the Buddhist ritual at the temple.
If you want to participate, please tell us and we shall make sure you will be well protected.
No.
I shall go to Mi Ahn temple.
I have to verify that he really became a monk.
Monk Myung Jin!
The queen is headed this way.
Welcome, queen.
This monk is now in our care.
I'm Myung Jin.
I have someone to introduce you to, Prince.
You are the one who insulted me back then!
How dare you bring such a guy to me?
-----empty-----
It's your turn, Prince.
-----empty----- -----empty----- -----empty-----
I have more power than mother has.
I will become king.
-----empty-----
In any case, that person is my mother.
I will do my utmost for you.
-= Episode 24 =-
You've got the woman whom you've been yearning for.
You should be very happy now.
Happy.
Very happy.
Don't be sarcastic.
I've always been a lecher.
Haven't you always known that?
Did she say she's happy too?
To be the Crown Prince's wife, how can she not be happy?
She's very, very happy.
Her laughter was full of joy.
Is that so?
Convey to her my congratulations and felicitations.
Also convey to her, that her laughter won't be for long.
I...
What am I, that you're so heartbroken?
Dream...
This isn't a dream, is it?
Agassi, don't leave, don't leave me.
I...
I can't let you go.
As long as I'm with you, anywhere will be fine.
Even if I were to lose my status and position, I'm fine with that.
As long as I have you, that's enough for me.
You can't be like this.
Gye Baek, you don't belong solely to me.
You, Gye Baek, belong to the people, to Baekje.
Don't be so disheartened because of me.
Agassi.
In my heart there's only you.
Don't think that you've lost me to His Highness, but that you've handed me over to Baekje, our country.
I, Eun Go , will one day... return to your side.
That day will definitely come.
You must wait for me until then.
You must persevere.
I can't hold on until then.
I'm dying.
I can't let you go.
You belong to me, agassi.
I can't let you go.
Agassi.
Have you met Gye Baek?
So, you're satisfied now?
Do you regret the situation you're in now?
Making a decision that will allow me to continue living, what's there to regret?
No, you will regret it, won't you?
What person in your situation wouldn't regret it?
You've said previously, being ruthless is the best policy.
You'll regret giving your affections to Gye Baek and I.
That's how I feel too.
Why is it that I so desire your affections?
Why is it that I must love you when you love someone else?
But no matter how much I regret this, I still crave for your affections.
Bear my children.
Not a child who'll resemble me, a useless good for nothing person, but one who'll resemble you.
Your Highness.
Children, let's give the General a glass of water, what say all of you?
To bolster his spirit.
Good!
It's already been two months.
He needs a bit more time.
How much longer exactly?
Really, what is so desirable about a woman, that the one who won and the one who lost, both end up dissatisfied.
I really can't understand.
If it was you, you would have looked for another woman immediately.
It's because he has eyes only for one person, that's why the hurt is so deep.
Over the years, we've never had a warrior, but there'll come a day when he'll be able to forget.
Yes, time should pass quickly.
If this goes on, our brother will die.
What?
His Highness has been at that woman's residence several times?
Yes.
Can it be you were mistaken?
-=Dragon child:
A child of royal blood.=- It's the rule that he's not to enter the residence of a woman who's pregnant with a dragon child.
I saw it with my own eyes.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Have you been giving any medicine to that Mok woman?
Yes.
Let me have a look at the medicine.
Let me have a look.
What are you saying?
Eun Go doesn't seem to be pregnant?
Even though I'm fearful to inform you, the medicine that she's taking raises suspicions.
What is suspicious about the medicine?
Come in.
He's a doctor that I brought in from outside.
Tell us in detail about the medicine.
This medicine is to help a person conceive.
The herbs in this concoction are especially harmful to a pregnant woman.
Therefore it's something that she shouldn't consume.
Who's the one who asked you to pronounce a fake pregnancy?
Admit your wrongdoings now!
We've obtained a confession from the royal physician.
It was an order from His Highness, the Crown Prince.
Go and seize Eun Go immediately.
Yes, Your Majesty.
What's the matter?
Drag her away!
Yes!
What are you people doing?
It's an order from His Majesty.
Your Highness.
Your Majesty, please kill me and spare Eun Go.
This is all my doing.
Eun Go only did what I told her.
I'm begging you to spare her.
You miscreant!
You lied to me and still expect me to forgive you?
It's fine if you won't forgive me.
What?
Why don't you just revoke my status, and reduce me to a commoner.
But, can you just spare Eun Go?
If Eun Go dies, I will follow suit.
You... dare to threaten me?
It's not a threat.
She's a woman who's more precious to me than my own life.
Your Majesty abandoned my mother, but if I have to abandon everything to save Eun Go, I will do so.
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
What is that woman to you?
What is she really, that you're willing to abandon everything for her?
She's like my country, Baekje.
She is my country.
Imbecile.
I've told you time and time again, what is everything to men and women, can only be a part to a monarch.
As far as Your Majesty was concerned, was my mother just a bit part?
To my mother, Your Majesty was everything.
The king that I want to be is everything to this country.
To be everything to the people, and to be everything to the woman I love.
Nothing should just be a bit part to the monarch.
I will live with that thought in my mind.
Gye Baek.
Stop right there!
Get out of the way.
Not once have I killed a Baekje soldier, all of you also don't want to be cut down.
General, we're just obeying orders, there's nothing we can do.
Stop!
Move away,
I'll take full responsibility.
Move away!
Yes.
The end result is still the same, so why must you do this?
I'm able to continue living solely by treating your existence in this world as a consolation.
If you die, agassi, what will I do?
Don't... say anymore.
Don't come to harm because of me.
Leave.
Furthermore,
forget about me.
How can I forget?
Can you?
Then treat it as if you were dreaming.
I will treat it as a dream as well.
No, I can't.
Whether in death or life, I will be with you.
This is a prison break.
Both of you will not be able to get far.
When you said you wanted to save agassi, is this it?
I will protect agassi.
I will find a way!
I'm not going to trust you anymore.
I also will do my best.
If His Majesty were to kill Eun Go, he will have to kill me too.
Crown Prince.
Do you want to leave?
Agassi!
Agassi!
Eun Go!
Eun Go!
Agassi!
Eun Go!
Eun Go!
How is she?
It's not necessary to get too worried.
Her fainting spell was due to her pregnancy.
Pregnant?
That's impossible!
Is she really pregnant?
Yes.
She's pregnant.
Eun Go.
Let him leave.
Yes.
It'll be more painful for him to bear if he stays here.
Yes, you're right.
-=7 years later=-.
I will surrender, don't kill them.
What is this?
Don't surrender, please don't surrender.
Do you know you are people without loyalty?
People in the city are all dead.
In order that you can live, what did you say to me?
Surrender?
Surrender?
You should just die like a man.
Should just die, all of you.
General Gye Baek looks generously on those who surrender.
Is that a lie?
Yes, it's a lie, a lie.
So you believe me now?
Do you know how many Silla prisoners of war there are, and do you know how much they eat?
They eat a lot more compared to us Baekje subjects.
We are fighting each other in battle, in such a situation, it's better for you to die than for us to feed you.
Who am I?
I am General Gye Baek's military advisor.
We can't be burdened with all of you.
Thus, I've decided, in order to reduce our burden,
release the arrows.
Stop!
What is it?
You...
You're here, General.
Who asked you to kill them?
Abou that, General...
We should spare them by right, but due to economic factors, we have to kill them.
Is the most junior official trying to go against the General?
Is the most junior official trying to go against the General?
Most junior official...
Do you wish to die earlier than the Silla subjects?
Most junior official Dok Gae.
Just because I'm the most junior official, does that mean you have to emphasize it?
All of you have really grown in stature.
What he said is right, we have more Silla people compared to our own people.
Our food rations aren't abundant.
War doesn't dictate that we must kill, they can be turned into our subjects later on.
Keep your weapons.
Keep them.
We can live, we can live.
I admit defeat.
Thank you for sparing our lives,
General Gye Baek.
Why are we letting all the fish off, big and small?
I'm still undecided which fish to catch.
Your Majesty.
General Gye Baek is here with his military officials.
I, only I,
am the rightful master of Baekje.
Your Majesty.
General Gye Baek has, in the space of five days, occupied the enemy's territory.
Congratulations, Your Majesty.
In 5 days, we managed to capture 39 cities.
Thirty nine cities is a record that has never happened before in our country.
This record, we can now say, has been set by General Gye Baek.
Now, the moment Silla subjects hear General Gye Baek's name, they run helter skelter.
Furthermore, he won't kill the prisoners of war.
Now many of Silla's subjects have become Baekje's subjects.
This is Your Majesty's blessings.
The common people are saying that Your Majesty, together with General Gye Baek, will rule the world.
Yes,
Gye Baek is the real hero of this country.
Gye Baek is really amazing.
Really amazing.
How can you, as a Minister, let such words flow out of your mouth so easily?
What did I do wrong?
You made His Majesty unhappy earlier, don't you know that?
Gye Baek is the God of War.
This is something this country never had before.
Someone who can guide the country.
Don't you know that this will make His Majesty unhappy?
I'm really...
Can't I speak the truth?
It's because of Gye Baek's efforts that His Majesty is able to expand his territory.
If he's unhappy over this matter, then he's just too petty minded.
You still don't understand what I'm saying?
I understand, I understand.
The greater Gye Baek's deeds are, the more cautious His Majesty will be.
Then Gye Baek will be in greater danger.
If you know, why did you do that?
It's because I know that I deliberately said that.
If Gye Baek were to get stronger and more powerful, His Majesty will curtail him.
But...
If Gye Baek were to become stronger and more powerful, if he were to surpass His Majesty, then His Majesty will be powerless to do anything.
You must be insane, right?
What are you thinking!
I don't understand.
He was a Crown Prince for 2 years.
He succeeded to the throne 5 years ago.
He told us he'd be implementing reforms, but what has he done until now?
Why didn't he implement them?
To abolish personal taxes on the commoners, to tax the noblemen, so in this way the treasury should have adequate funds.
Also, because of Gye Baek's deeds, the country's territory has expanded.
Many Silla subjects have now become Baekje subjects.
Are these minor matters?
Then the plan that you wish to implement, has it been done?
When are you intending to implement it?
When can the people be master of this country?
It's only when we reach that point, that we can finally say, reform is in place now.
Why are you in such a hurry?
These matters won't happen during your lifetime.
If we can initiate the reform, we've already completed our mission.
If we were to complete everything, then there'll be nothing for future generations to accomplish.
We must leave them something to do.
Who are you trying to convince?
I won't.
Follow me and let's go and look for His Majesty.
Why?
We can't let Gye Baek become His Majesty's enemy.
There, there.
Don't confuse the matter by thinking that you're Gye Baek.
Really amazing.
He hasn't failed once, and went on to capture 39 cities in a row.
The common people have said, as long as there's Gye Baek, they don't fear any invasion.
They say we can hold our own against the Tang Dynasty.
What's the situation like in Silla?
Of course they are feeling frustrated.
Our spies have reported that their military forces will collapse soon.
Yes,
Gye Baek is the real hero of this country.
Gye Baek is really amazing.
Really amazing.
But... why is your expression like that?
Did something bad happen?
No, it is not that.
Is it because you're worried about General Gye Baek?
No, I'm not.
Your Majesty.
How could your servant not understand Your Majesty's feelings?
Gye Baek left 7 years ago with that feeling, and has been in battle since.
It's not just this matter,
His Majesty will not want to see Gye Baek in a good light.
Yes, you're right.
To see the people's fanatical enthusiasm towards General Gye Baek at present, we can't tell who they consider the actual king of this country.
This won't do,
I need to go and see His Majesty.
You brat!
Why do you not greet me?
It's because he's still too young to understand.
Please make that allowance, Your Majesty.
He's not behaving like this because he's young, isn't it a question of lack of teaching?
You've crossed the line.
Don't cry.
Such arrogance.
But of course, what good can come from the remnants of the Sa Taek family.
I am really grateful to Your Majesty the Queen.
What?
There are all things that had passed but I'll just mention one.
When I was arrested previously, I really didn't want to go on living.
But do you know why I wanted to go on living?
It's because of the words you said when you came looking for me.
His Majesty has decided that you'll be beheaded tomorrow before all the officials, civil and military.
But...
I don't wish for you to die such an easy death.
You should have just killed me right from the start.
Why did you have to kill so many innocent people?
Are you having regrets now?
Yes, you must be regretting it now.
Your Majesty is my benefactor.
I will certainly repay you for that.
Is there anyone outside?
Are you calling me, Your Majesty?
Bring me the wine.
It's harmful to your body, Your Majesty.
You should drink less.
You.
I'm in the midst of congratulating Gye Baek on his victories.
Why are you nagging me?
Are you not going to bring it?
Yes, I will.
You've done well, Gye Baek.
You just need to do a little bit more and you'll be able to capture the hearts of the people and Baekje's lands.
Yes, that's right.
Your Majesty.
Naesin jwapyeong and Naedu jwapyeong seeks an audience with you.
I want to be alone.
Your Majesty.
Leave.
I want to congratulate Gye Baek on his victories by myself.
Don't be like this.
What do you say if we look for Gye Baek and congratulate him personally?
Yes, the credit for the successful capture of the 39 cities belong to Your Majesty.
If Your Majesty were to personally congratulate him,
Your Majesty's eminence will spread far and wide.
And also, if Your Majesty were to lead the army in the attack on the next city, then the credit for the victories on the capture of all the 40 cities will belong to Your Majesty.
This will be your legacy.
Yes, that's correct.
I've come to say the same thing.
After this, we must let the enemy see,
Your Majesty's eminence and glory.
We've already gathered the army.
We have an estimated 7 thousand soldiers in the city.
We have about 2 thousand people in the city.
Due to our soldiers high morale, we can definitely capture it in ten days.
How long will it take us to reach that city?
If we mobilize all the military personnel, it'll take us 4 days.
Our enemy will also expect us in 4 days.
They will plan their countermeasures accordingly.
We must reach there in 3 days time, and get ready to attack.
On the fourth day we must launch our attack
Let's go.
We'll make a headstart to that city.
General.
Have the preparations been made for our mission?
Yes, even though we are ready, but it's too late to leave now.
What are you saying?
We just received the news that His Majesty is rushing here.
Your loyal servant pays his respect to Your Majesty.
Rise.
We haven't met in a long time.
has not been counting the days.
It's already been 7 years.
Have you been well, Your Majesty?
Have a seat.
Such admirable discipline.
Who's the front line officer who'll be leading the attack?
Come forward.
Your servant Shidoek Dae Su, paying my respect to Your Majesty.
Your servant, Shidoek Yong Su, pays his respect to Your Majesty.
You both are worthy shidoeks.
-= shidoek:
Our of 16 ranks, this is rank number 8.=-
I'm surprise.
-= shidoek:
Our of 16 ranks, this is rank number 8.=-
This wine is bestowed by His Majesty.
Accept it quickly.
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
Please give me tea instead.
You're not allowed to drink wine?
That's not it,
It's because I've made a pledge with the General.
Before we capture the city,
I will not touch a drop of liquor.
Furthermore, because we won't drink wine, this can help to save some food ration.
We can then give this food ration to the people of Silla for their consumption.
and this will help to turn them to become Baekje's subjects.
This will in turn help us greatly in our mission.
That is why your servants cannot drink wine.
You're all truly Gye Baek's officers.
Very good.
I will not insist and force all of you then.
Just finish that cup then.
Your Majesty.
Accept it quickly.
I've already promised you, you can't even drink that one cup?
Do I have to get your permission even for this?
Your Majesty, can't you just treat it that they have accepted the cup?
If we set this precedent, I fear this might affect the military discipline.
Fine, strict military discipline is like a diamond.
Impressive.
Extremely impressive.
Do you still trust Gye Baek?
I understand you well.
It was like this before as well.
There's also the matter of Gye Baek's sweetheart.
You no longer treat Gye Baek as your brother.
Did I say anything wrong?
Although I don't know where you heard this rumour,
I did not snatch his sweetheart, all I did was saved the woman I loved.
Furthermore, Gye Baek is still my brother.
Crown Prince.
Yes.
As the saying goes, what goes around comes around.
but there'll still be exceptions to the rule.
That is... the monarch.
I know, just as I expected it.
Gye Baek will turn out to be a double-edged sword.
Gye Baek, in gaining a victory over the enemy, will similarly gain the people's love.
I kept getting this instinct, the qualities that he possessed are the qualities that a monarch should have.
Your Majesty.
There's one more thing that I know, in your heart,
there exists in unison, both feelings of guilt and jealousy towards Gye Baek.
But, sooner or later, you won't be able to get rid of that resentment.
Even if you planted the seeds yourself, but sometimes you must use your feet to trample on it, so that it won't continue to grow.
That is something that only a monarch can do.
Are you asking me to kill Gye Baek?
Even if Gye Baek becomes a hero, if all the people were to follow you, nothing will happen.
But if they were to follow Gye Baek, then clearly they have to make a choice.
If the centre of the universe should come into disorder, chaos will naturally follow.
Aren't you, in a better position to know than anyone else, that your father is dying.
All these years seems like a dream.
That blue sky and the green mountains, how will they remember me?
The tea is very strong.
Your Majesty.
Father.
Come and take a walk with me.
Every attack that you launched against the cities has been full of valour.
Why have you never failed even once?
To capture and occupy so many cities,
I'm very curious about what remarkable strategy you employed.
I can't say it's any remarkable strategy,
What I did was just did not apply these three tactics in combat.
Did not apply these three tactics in combat?
never fight in a place where the enemy wanted us to fight.
Second, never fight using methods the enemy wanted us to use.
And finally, never fight at a time that the enemy desire.
This is very amazing.
As long as we follow that, the enemy cannot predict our moves.
They can only lose.
From whom did you learn that?
It's something I learn and experience in battle.
I sent letters to hyeongnim and informed them, they, in turn, devised and organised a system and have them recorded and sent over the books to me.
Your servant only apply what's written there.
That's what happened.
But...
Why didn't you send me those letters?
I'm sad.
Please forgive me.
I thought you're too busy with affairs of the state.
Is it not because of my prejudice against you?
That's correct.
If I were to say that's not so, I'll be lying.
But I've already forgotten it.
Wasn't Your Majesty trying to save Her Majesty?
After that, I've really regretted it.
Haven't I said to you before, that I commiserate with you?
Your servant is shocked to hear such words from you.
I despise Your Majesty.
But, why haven't you expressed it even once?
It's because I'm planning to take my revenge on you.
Revenge?
If your servant were to be brokenhearted because of that matter, and turn into a useless person, all I will be left with, will be a layer of skin.
But to overcome that,
I must become indispensable to this country.
A really strong person, and a real man.
And make you regret thereafter.
Your Majesty and Her Majesty.
That is how your servant dreamt revenge will be.
And also, that revenge, gives rise to a path that leads me to Baekje and the people of Baekje.
Good, do you think you have realized you dream?
Not yet.
To recover all the surrounding territory of Tang Ung city and to restore peace thereafter.
Only then can I be called a hero of Baekje.
Are you intending to attack Tang Ung city?
We should attack.
-= Next Episode Preview =-
Told me that it's with Her Majesty.
I know that is an excuse.
Your Majesty.
Are you happy?
Are you treating me as a murderer, wife?
Prince Tae intends to grasp the position of Crown Prince?
We've brought over another guest.
He is seeking his own death.
Do you want to kill an important person or an ordinary person.
Gye Baek accepts the edict.
You lead them there and then attack the city.
Your Majesty, please wake up.
I'm begging you, please wake up.
I'm begging you, please wake up.
If you leave just like that, even if I'm dead, I will hate you forever.
Your Majesty, are you awake?
Your Majesty!
How long have I been lying like this?
One and a half months.
One and a half months.
That was a really good, long sleep.
Help me to get up.
Thank you very much for waking up.
I really thank you very much for waking up.
Don't cry.
I'm sure a lot of things must have happened during this period.
-= Episode 30 =-
You were looking for me?
Come here.
His Majesty has regained consciousness.
Now that you know, this is His Majesty's command.
Make sure that only you know of this matter.
Make sure you're the only one to guard His Majesty's residence from now on.
Don't let anyone go in.
I understand, Deok Sol.
Yes, that's right, everybody thought I was dead.
If Your Majesty hadn't woken up, I'd have followed you.
Didn't Gye Baek protect you?
General Gye Baek said he can't take sides.
He said he must remain neutral.
That's really unexpected.
I thought Gye Baek would return to you.
That I used a despicable trick to get you, you must have told Gye Baek about it as well?
How did you know that I was aware of that fact?
Didn't you say it yourself?
Didn't you stop at nothing to get me?
You're that king who exterminated the whole Mok clan just so you could have me.
After all that, are you going to abandon me just like that?
I have to continue living.
I have to live so that I can take my revenge.
Did you hear those words?
Of course.
I not only heard,
I was able to regain consciousness because you shed tears of blood.
Do you really hate me that much?
Yes, that's right.
From the time I learned the truth,
I detested you, I hated you.
You still want to take your revenge against me, right?
Yes, I want to do that.
But now it's different.
Why?
To nearly lose you after your accident.
Now I realise, everything that I have comes from you.
If I lose Your Majesty, I'll lose everything that I have too.
What do you hope to get from me?
I hope that your enemies, and mine, will disappear.
It's great that you have now regained consciousness.
Yes, whether it was in Gajamseong City or here, the one who protected me at all times was you.
Thank you, royal consort.
I will only follow Your Majesty from now onwards.
Is there already an order to evict me from my residence?
Yes, Your Highness.
The Queen issued the order.
Why are you still dallying?
Your Majesty.
I find it difficult to have to see you, therefore it's better if you leave quickly.
Your Majesty,
You have overstepped your boundaries, please rescind your order.
What do you mean by that?
I've already spoken of this with naedu jwapyeong.
With naedu jwapyeong?
Yes, since we've a successor to the throne now, we're sending all the concubines and the prince out of the palace.
Your servant will have a word with naedu jwapyeong again.
Furthermore, royal consort will not cause any trouble.
Please let her live quietly in the palace.
Don't say anymore, General.
I want it.
It's not the Queen's order, but it's by my own volition.
Your Majesty.
Looks like you still have your pride.
Your Majesty, I have a final request.
I will leave quietly, but please let me see His Majesty for a moment.
Fine, let's go together.
Your Highness, why are you like this?
Why?
Wait and you will know.
Your Majesty, please get well.
I will also pray for Your Majesty, even though I'm no longer in the palace.
Are you still obsessed?
Do you still believe that when His Majesty wakes up, he'll recall you?
His Majesty is already on his death bed.
And also, Baekje's king will be Tae.
At that time, we'll bury you and His Majesty together.
Since His Majesty dotes on you so much, you can go and accompany him.
Of course.
Right, the son should follow his mother and also leave.
That is only natural.
Your Majesty, did you hear that?
Your Highness, I'll escort you to your private residence.
Why?
Do you pity me?
I refuse your pity.
Your Highness, let me escort you.
You are no longer one of my people, you're General's follower now.
Let things be.
Your Majesty.
General, this is just like killing me.
What would a dead person need?
Please go back.
I'm sorry.
You really went to the extreme.
With your reform coming up, do you have to sacrifice the pitiful royal consort?
That's why I said I was sorry.
What is cruel is politics.
Anyway, we can't restore things to what they were, so you should protect Her Highness.
So pitiful.
Agassi is so pitiful.
(Agassi - young lady)
Your Majesty.
In order to implement the well-field system, we've prepared a set of family registers.
Family register?
It means a survey of the population of the land.
Is that so?
Since I've given my consent, just proceed with it.
I'll abide by your order.
What's next?
Your Majesty, your servant Gye Baek requests permission to report.
We need Your Majesty's handwritten confirmation in order to proceed with our alliance with Goguryeo.
Your Majesty, did you bring your seal?
No, wait for a while.
Your Majesty, don't you want to form an alliance with Goguryeo?
That's not it, the Great General has briefed me sufficiently.
I also believe this alliance is necessary.
But after all, for an alliance between countries, instead of the Queen's seal, isn't it better to use the country's jade seal?
Your Majesty, only His Majesty can use the country's jade seal.
Your Majesty, please withdraw your edict.
His Majesty is never going to recover.
The country's jade seal is as good as belonging to the crown prince.
Hurry up and get the jade seal.
I'm going to take this opportunity to tell the world our Tae has become the true monarch of Baekje.
Since when did Your Majesty and the crown prince became the masters of this country?
The master of Baekje is just me alone.
Your Majesty, I pay my respects to you.
Your Majesty.
Your servants pay their respects to Your Majesty.
Your Majesty held a banquet while I was critically ill?
Your Majesty.
You must have been very happy.
The moment I died, Your Majesty's son would become the king.
Please forgive me.
My Queen!
Yes, Your Majesty.
I've forgiven you many times.
When you did something wrong, I'd think of father-in-law and let things pass.
When I was ill, it was fine that you didn't even bother about me, but to disrupt the country's politics and claiming the Prince as the king.
How do you expect to wash away your crimes?
Your Majesty, I beg you.
Please forgive me this once.
I don't want to hear it!
I don't want to see you, leave now.
Your Majesty!
Please save me, royal consort Mok.
I will do whatever you say.
I'm begging you, royal consort Mok.
Please persuade His Majesty.
You said you wanted to bury me alive together with His Majesty, right?
Royal consort Mok.
And said further that the son should follow the mother, right?
I'm begging you.
It's fine that I die, please spare my Tae.
You choose.
Your Majesty dies together with your son, or join a religious order with your son, become a nun and a monk, and turn over a new leaf.
For the sake of daejwapyeong, Yeon Mun Jin,
I'm giving you this one last chance.
His Majesty's recovery is a good thing, but why did it happen right at the time when the Queen was doing that?
It could be because he wanted to seize the opportunity, and did that deliberately.
It's too late for regrets.
Although the Queen is a frivolous person,
If I'd told her first, things wouldn't have turned out this bad.
Heung Su, now is not the time for you to worry about the Queen.
We have to think about our own matters.
I won't regret what I'd done.
It's just a pity that we've missed out on our opportunity.
Look here, Heung Su.
My thinking is the same as Heung Su, hyeongnim.
(Hyeongnim - respected older brother)
We won't shift our responsibility to others for what we've done.
We did what we did for the country's sake.
Where are you going?
I'm going to see His Majesty.
To reform the Council meeting to enable the local county magistrates and common people to participate.
To change our present land system to the well-field system.
Looks like you really hoped that I'd die.
And also, Gye Baek, you wanting to form an alliance with Goguryeo.
I kept telling you not to liaise privately with Yeong Gye Somun.
Who were those supporting the Queen?
Who were those who supported the Queen in forming a government with the crown prince?
It was I, your servant.
But Your Majesty was critically ill, we had no choice in the matter.
Shouldn't it be a last resort?
Did you reckon I would die soon?
So therefore, Heung Su, you supported the Queen and instructed the crown prince privately?
Your Majesty, this is a misunderstanding.
Your Majesty, your servant did not support the Queen.
But recently, concerning the Queen's treatment of royal consort Mok, I am guilty.
Is that so?
The reform of the Council and the well-field land system, was initiated by me.
If you're dissatisfied with those matters, I will take full responsibility.
No, don't ask other people to shoulder the responsibility,
You will be solely responsible?
Your Majesty, we did these things together.
We shall shoulder the responsibility together.
Is that so?
Then can your servant ask Your Majesty something?
To allow the common people to participate in the Council meeting, and the implementation of the national land system, were these not Your Majesty's dreams a long time ago?
So can these matters be considered crimes?
No, they are not.
If they are now crimes, it can only mean Your Majesty has changed.
The two of you can leave.
I said, leave!
Yes, you are correct.
I changed a long time ago.
Do you know when?
From the time I snatched Eun Go from your hands.
Why didn't you take revenge?
You must have had your opportunities.
The fact that I didn't do it, was not for Your Majesty's sake.
Then, it was because of what?
It was because of this country, Baekje.
The fact that Your Majesty used a despicable trick to snatch away royal consort Mok, is something I won't forget.
Your Majesty is no longer my sworn brother.
But even though you're no longer my sworn brother,
I still hope that you will remain a wise monarch.
This is the one and only reason that will allow me to forgive you.
For Baekje's sake.
Not the king, but for Baekje's sake.
What do you think of Gye Baek's words?
Your Majesty is Baekje.
Everything in Baekje belongs to Your Majesty.
If they don't know that, Your Majesty should teach them.
His Majesty has woken up?
Really?
Of course.
What a relief.
How fortunate.
The two of you come nearer, come.
The two of you come nearer, come.
Idiots!
Why don't the two of you have any brains?
That's the reason why both of you cannot rise to be great men.
As the country's military leaders, why is it wrong for us to be happy?
Dok Gae, are you a traitor?
He could very well be Silla and Goguryeo's spy.
You both are now really coming up with all sorts of nonsense.
You both are really...
Think about it.
Isn't General Gye Baek the commander of this country now?
But now His Majesty is awake, what can he do except relinquish his power.
What does that mean?
In other words he now has to step down from Great General to a normal General.
Then what about us?
From Great General's subordinates to being the subordinates of a normal General.
Even if the General were to relinquish his power, he'll still be Baekje's hero.
Don't say that.
Is there anything in particular that you wish to see me about?
Yes, is it because of your rejection on the last occasion making me ill at ease?
Do not worry.
You've helped me for a long time.
I will not keep that matter in my heart.
I came not because of that matter.
I am here to stop you from driving away the Queen, and to elevate yourself to that position.
Is that so?
I cannot be the Queen?
You can do other things for power.
Install Prince Hyo as the Crown Prince, this is fine, but... don't become the Queen.
Tell me the reason.
You must keep your dissatisfaction in your heart.
To do this will protect His Majesty.
Where to begin?
Start with Your Highness.
If you become the Queen, by doing this
Your Highness will change.
Will I, Eun Go, cause the country to perish?
It's possible.
Your Highness, please show your leniency.
Tell His Majesty to forgive the Queen and the others.
This is the right thing for Your Highness to do.
Sinyeo.
I'll just pretend I didn't hear that.
I said it earlier,
I've received much help from you, Sinyeo.
But...
My forgiveness and leniency is only reserved for you.
In future, you should no longer expect anything else from me.
I'm returning the Queen's bestowment proclamation, and the pheonix seal.
Would you please, live a long life, Your Majesty.
Live quietly.
Otherwise, what will become of you, you should know better than anyone else.
I will keep that in mind.
Naedu Jwapyeong.
You're the Queen's loyal servant and Prince Tae's teacher.
If the owner leaves, the dog reared by the owner should also follow suit.
It should not be a matter Your Highness should interfere with.
Is that so?
I, Heung Su, have never been obsessed with being a court official.
If I'm asked to leave, I'll leave.
If I'm asked to die, I'll die.
But I'll never comply with your words.
You're really smart, but let's see how long you will last.
The Queen has been driven out, now it should be Heung Su's turn.
I don't know what crime His Majesty will invent.
Heung Su hyeongnim didn't commit any crime, why must he be punished?
Gye Baek.
His Majesty does not regard us as his sworn brothers anymore.
Also His Majesty is watching you.
Promise me, even if Heung Su is punished, you will not speak up on his behalf.
Otherwise, he may use the excuse of your alliance with Goguryeo to punish you too.
If you're not careful, you may even lose your life.
His Majesty is really furious because of what has been happening in the royal court.
The Queen acting as proxy, the Crown Prince's installation and the political council reform.
All these happened because the Ministers were taking advantage of His Majesty's absence.
But, everybody knows those matters were done in the interests of the country.
I know that the matter of proxy and the installation of the Crown Prince can be considered of national interest.
But... what about the political council reform and the well-field land reform?
Those matters were because of naesin jwapyeong and naedu jwapyeong's strong recommendations.
We had no choice in the matter.
That's right.
It was never our intention right from the start.
Then regarding this, if you tell His Majesty about it, he'll exempt the two of you from responsibility.
Today we're going to determine naedu jwapyeong's guilt.
Tell him his crime.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Naedu jwapyeong, in making use of the Queen, disrupted the country's national policies, called all the county lords here and turned them into his followers.
Your Majesty.
Your servant Seong Chung has something to say.
The reason why we asked the local county lords to attend the political council meeting was because we wanted the council to make the decisions based on public sentiments.
This decision was not made solely by naedu jwapyeong.
The decision was made together with me and the rest of the ministers.
Is that so?
Was it really the intention of these ministers?
Your Majesty!
In fact it was all because of General Gye Baek that we agreed to follow naedu jwapyeong.
Great General and naedu jwapyeong have a very close relationship.
Who'd dare to reject the suggestion of the commander of the country's military power.
Did you forget what I said?
No matter what they say, endure it.
Everybody listen,
Naedu Jwapyeong, relying on the Queen, disrupted national policies.
This is a crime that deserves death, but because of his past contribution, I'm going to spare his life.
Jojeong jwapyeong.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I'm going to remove naedu jwapyeong from his office.
I'm going to remove naedu jwapyeong from his office.
Confiscate all his assets.
I will obey, Your Majesty.
I'm grateful to Your Majesty for sparing my life.
I, Heung Su, will never step into this royal court again.
I will also not see Your Majesty again.
I pray that you have ten thousand years of boundless longevity.
There's one other matter.
From today onwards,
I want to abolish the political council.
Your Majesty!
To abolish the political Council, how can you say that?
Daejwapyeong!
The political council no longer serves its purpose.
Why can't we abolish it?
Your Highness.
The political council meeting has for a long time resolved Baekje's major issues and policies.
What exactly is the political council?
Isn't it an instrument used to cause disorder in the country when I was ill?
From today onwards, I will abolish the political council.
If you don't want to stand next to the criminals, then give this careful thought.
What brings you here so urgently, General?
Our positions are now reversed.
Your Highness, please don't let naedu jwapyeong, Heung Su, leave.
Please persuade His Majesty.
Naedu jwapyeong was punished because he committed a crime.
I just pointed out his crime.
Your Highness
His Majesty must still be suffering from the after effects of his coma, and is still a bit confused.
We shouldn't be provoking His Majesty in his present condition.
Provoke?
General.
Now is not the time for you to worry about others.
His Majesty asked me how he should handle you.
And I... am thinking of an answer now.
In what way am I bad, that you left me like this?
The way you stayed neutral last time General,
His Majesty will remove you from your position in retaliation.
It doesn't matter what happens to me.
Don't keep the thought that I want to own this country.
To own this country.
This sentence, sounds like...
Please beg me to protect you!
Not for naedu jwapyeong's sake.
If you beseech me, if you do that for old times sake, I'll promise you.
I will not refuse you like you did me.
I, Eun Go, will promise you.
Why must I beseech you?
I didn't do anything wrong.
Not once did I waver because of our personal relationship.
If I made a mistake, it was that I didn't stop you from driving the Queen out.
Are you threatening me now?
If you're coming here to discuss a solution with me, you had better change your attitude first.
Otherwise, don't come looking for me.
Is there no way we can get rid of Gye Baek?
Yes, Your Majesty.
There's only one way.
That is if General Gye Baek resigns voluntarily and leaves for the border.
We don't have to make the first move.
We cannot fall in with Silla's wishes.
I thought you would have come up with an idea by now.
Seems like you still have feelings for Gye Baek.
Your Majesty, after the installation of the Crown Prince, we were no longer in touch, so don't say that.
So as long as I order Gye Baek to resign and go to the border, that will do, won't it?
Let him be the first to say that.
Your Majesty mustn't issue an order.
Let's just wait for a while.
Even if Your Majesty were to stay still, it will come to you.
This cannot happen.
To abolish the political council.
We must stop this.
Yes, all our major issues were resolved by the political council meeting.
The political council meeting is our Baekje's tradition, and also our foundation.
We can't allow the political council meeting to be abolished.
If the political council meeting is abolished, it will be the start of absolute rule by His Majesty.
I'm here with all of you because I too want to stop such a thing.
How about if all the nobility, the ministers and the scholars were to send in a petition?
I understand what you mean, naesin jwapyeong, but right now His Majesty is very angry.
Until His Majesty cools down, we should avoid sending such a petition.
Doing that will only make the matter worse.
His Majesty has already made his declaration that if we continue to remain, he'll definitely abolish the political council meeting.
If we want to stop him, the only way is to send in a joint petition.
Are you all burdened by the joint petition?
After sending in the joint petition, we won't let just one person be implicated.
Furthermore, there's no other way to stop it.
You don't want to do this, but on the other hand you want to oppose the abolition.
You are all really despicable.
Naesin jwapyeong, you have overstepped the boundary.
Are you blaming us now?
Who was the one who brought in all these local county lords to participate in the political council meeting in the first place?
If that hadn't happened,
His Majesty wouldn't have abolished the political council meeting.
This is all yours and naedu jwapyeong's fault.
I'm also responsible to a large extent.
To proceed with such reform when His Majesty was critically ill, we were wrong.
But, even if he were to abolish the reformed council, he shouldn't abolish the original council.
The council meeting is only used to make, and resolve, national policies.
To correct His Majesty's mistaken belief, and establish a relationship between a monarch and his ministers, only then can there be a foundation to build on.
Then Great General should speak up on our behalf.
We don't have your power and your influence.
If all of you so wish, I will do it.
No Gye Baek, you mustn't do this.
Since nobody wants to do it, then I'll have to step forward.
Why should you.
If Great General were to speak up, this can only worsen the matter.
Don't all of you know we shouldn't be despicable and hide behind Great General's back.
Naesin jwapyeong!
So I beg all of you, in order to avoid one person shouldering the full responsibility, let's put in a joint petition.
Only by doing that can we get our views across and no one individual will be harmed.
I'm begging all of you once again.
To oppose the abolition of the Council meeting by a petition, they have planned this well.
The Council meeting is just like their last line of defence.
They won't give up so easily.
Your Majesty.
What?
This is a petition from the scholars and the local county lords.
It's not necessary to read them.
It must be related to the abolition of the Council meeting.
Is this what you meant by vehement resistance?
If everyone believes what's written in the petition is reasonable, there's nothing Your Majesty can do.
So, how about let's just do as they say?
We can't kill everyone.
We also can't ignore the joint petition.
I will definitely abolish the council meeting.
Do you have any good ideas?
We cannot punish everyone, but if we make an example of punishing one person, the rest will be fearful and won't dare to continue.
There are so many who sent in their petitions, who can we punish?
Not for sending in the petition, but to execute him for other crimes.
Other crimes?
Who should we charge?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Don't we have wisa jwapyeong, whom General Gye Baek conducted an investigation into previously?
The Queen said to release him because he's one of her supporters.
Charge him with the crime of spying to prevent his family from ever regaining their status.
If we do that, it will be a good example to them to ensure they give up hope completely.
What royal edict?
What is my crime that you are doing this to me?
Criminal Deok Sol, you leaked secret information regarding the royalty, caused turmoil among the people and had secret dealings with Silla spies.
You've been removed from office, and driven out of the nine clans.
What spy?
Wasn't that matter settled?
Take him away.
Yes.
How can they do this?
This is not to kill the spy, but to punish us for petitioning.
This is 'killing the chicken to warn the monkey.' (Punish an individual to set an example to others)
This is absolute tyranny.
This is sooner than I thought.
What shall we do now?
The noblemen are uneasy because of this.
They're asking themselves when they'll be charged with a crime and beheaded.
That makes sense.
If you shake it out, nobody is dust free.
(Everyone has a skeleton in the cupboard)
Furthermore, there'll be many of those who were previously exempted from punishment by royal consort Mok.
They, more than the rest, must be trembling with fear.
Looks like I'll have to go and see His Majesty.
No, you shouldn't.
You stay where you are.
I'll seek an audience.
He's right, now is not the time for you to speak up.
His Majesty is biding his time, waiting for you to speak up.
If His Majesty is waiting for me to speak, isn't it more imperative that I go and see him?
Gye Baek, you can only stand up against him once.
If you stand up against him, it will be the last time you will do so.
Even if you don't agree, there'll be soldiers who'll insist on following you.
Even if you cut off all your subordinates' hands and feet, if they have to crawl and enter the palace to save you, they will do so.
The same thing happened when they wanted to behead you previously.
They'll march into the palace to take revenge on your behalf.
Those are your soldiers, the ones who'll live and die together with you.
Furthermore, the people will do the same thing.
They'll definitely revolt because of you.
Gye Baek, if you were to lose in any battle, that will spell the death of Baekje.
There's only one person who can stop His Majesty from this tyranny.
That is you.
This is a real joke.
We thought when His Majesty was in a coma, that was the critical period, but actually, the real critical period is now.
Why have you called us to come to the council meeting ground?
Do you want to know why I called all of you here?
The council meeting will definitely be abolished.
This is His Majesty's stubborn stand.
The joint petition, or whatever, it will only invite more blood.
I want to protect eveyone.
Didn't all of you do this to protect your own position?
I will abide by His Majesty's order and demolish this pavilion.
Your Highness, you can't do that.
Don't you realize that as of now the council meeting has been abolished.
All of you should follow His Majesty and do the Hoe Maeng Rok.
-= Hoe Maeng Rok: record of meetings conducted by rulers for the purpose of formalizing alliances, finalizing treaties = = Hoe Maeng Rok: record of meetings conducted by rulers for the purpose of formalizing alliances, finalizing treaties =- What Hoe Maeng Rok?
-= Hoe Maeng Rok: record of meetings conducted by rulers for the purpose of formalizing alliances, finalizing treaties =- It's a means of showing your loyalty.
Don't be despicable and hide behind someone else.
Just promise His Majesty your loyalty.
If you do that, His Majesty will regard all of you as people on his side.
In that case, all of you will be safe, won't you?
Thus, the political council meeting is now abolished.
In future the ministers and the noblemen will not dare to defy you again.
And also, they won't be able to lend their support to General Gye Baek again.
You're really my consort.
You have worked hard.
Your Majesty, naesin jwapyeong is seeking an audience.
Tell him to leave.
Your Majesty, I have something I want to say.
So disrespecful!
Didn't His Majesty tell you to leave?
Fine, say what you want to say.
Are you here to oppose the abolition of the council meeting?
That matter is over.
If you came because of that, then you should just leave.
Your Majesty, you cannot abolish the council meeting.
Leave.
Your Majesty, don't let my words fall on deaf ears.
In order to form the right government policies, you need to have the council meeting.
I told you to leave.
Your Majesty, you must listen, even if the advice proffered is contrary to your own views.
I'm telling you to leave!
This council meeting must...
Your Majesty, please forgive your servant's disloyalty, but the council meeting must be continued.
I still regard you as my sworn brother, so I'll let this pass.
Therefore leave now.
Your Majesty!
What happened?
It is nothing.
I misjudged the steps and fell down.
Is this His Majesty's doing?
No, it's because I fell.
How can His Majesty do that?
No, it's not!
How many times must I tell you before you understand?
I fell down a flight of steps.
Yes, you only fell down a flight of steps.
Yes, now you are clear.
Let's go.
You came looking for me, why are you not saying a word?
Hurry up and tell me.
Your Majesty.
Tell me.
Your Majesty.
What do you want to tell me?
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, Your Majesty, Your Majesty!
How many times do you want to say 'Your Majesty'?
If you have nothing to say, then leave.
Please be judicious, Your Majesty.
What?
What did you just say?
Did I hear wrongly?
I didn't hear what you said.
What did you say, say it again?
This is something that shouldn't happen.
Your Majesty is now a despot!
Despot?
I'm speechless!
Have you become insane?
Don't you know who you are standing in front of?
I don't know who.
Your Majesty is not the same person I used to know.
You've grown up, Gye Baek!
You had a taste of power when I was ill in bed.
Now you're used to behaving like a king.
Right, try taking it away.
Don't you have the power?
Be like Yeong Gye Somun, use your power to take it away.
Forget it.
I don't even have a little desire to want to claim that position.
No, you want to be the king.
Do you think I don't know what you desire?
That's why forming an alliance with Goguryeo, you did as you pleased.
Same with wisa jwapyeong, you did as you pleased.
Similarly, you did as you pleased with the noblemen, twisting them around your fingers.
Everything I did was for Baekje and the people.
No, that's not it.
You wanted to kill me because of that matter with Eun Go.
Thereafter you wanted to seize my position.
Isn't that what you really want?
You're so pitiful.
Why have you become like this?
Because of me?
It's all because of me?
If I'm not around, will that do?
Are you insulting me?
How dare you?
Your Majesty!
Don't pardon those who have wronged you.
Although I want to kill myself right now, our enemy is watching our country and people closely.
If you don't want that, then you can send me to the border.
I won't return to Sabi City again.
Good.
In that case, return the title of Great General before you leave.
But I have a request, reinstate naedu jwapyeong to his former post.
No, that's not possible.
Then, I can't leave either.
Without naedu jwapyeong and naesin jwapyeong in the royal court, I'm unable to let go of my apprehension.
Even If I go to the border, I'll keep wanting to return.
You dare to talk about conditions with me?
I promise you.
Go and forget about here, and lead a peaceful life there.
Your Highness, I've decided to leave Sabi City.
Are you here to say your goodbyes?
It's not necessary.
I don't want to say goodbye to you.
I'm not here to say goodbye, but I came because I wanted to entrust you with something.
Please, assist His Majesty in his duties.
And please, return to the wise Eun Go agassi of before.
Please promise me you'll agree to my request.
Revenge?
If your servant were to be brokenhearted because of that matter, and turn into a useless person, all I will be left with, will be a layer of skin.
To overcome that, I must become indispensable to this country.
A really strong person, and a real man.
And make you regret thereafter.
Your Majesty, and Her Majesty.
That is how your servant dreamt revenge will be.
And also, that revenge, gives rise to a path that leads me to Baekje and the people of Baekje.
So, have you realized your dream yet?
Not yet.
To recover all the surrounding territory of Danghang City.
Only then can I be called a hero of Baekje.
Are you intending to attack Danghang City?
We have to attack.
-= Episode 25 =-
Are you hurt anywhere?
How could I not sustain any injury?
I've been stabbed, cut and pounded.
There's not a place that's intact.
But when I was attacking the city with General Gye Baek, the pain would disappear.
The General, he's not injured, is he?
No, not even once.
Don't worry.
And if anyone should be brave enough to even touch him, I'd kill them.
How could he have sustained any injuries?
That's a relief.
So when will you be returning to the palace?
We have to attack quickly.
Why are we delaying it.
His Majesty won't delay it much longer.
Enter!
What's this?
Clothes.
It's also cold in Sabi City, let alone here.
I made it with my own hands.
Did you really make this for me?
Yes.
Furthermore, you made two sets?
No, one is for...
That's what I suspected.
Why don't you give it to him personally?
Cho Yeong.
We'll be setting out tomorrow.
You are here.
I came to give Cho Yeong something.
Then I'll...
Why are you like this?
Giving me something is just an excuse.
Don't be disrespectful.
Don't you know that I've always been an ill mannered person?
Then, I will just take my leave.
Keep safe.
Your Highness.
Are you happy?
I'm still alive.
How can you say such words?
You must be happy.
If you should still feel a little apologetic towards me, discard every bit of it.
In these 7 years
I've thrown myself at the mountains and erased everything.
That's how I've lived.
Now,
I've forgotten everything.
What's left now, is the smell of blood from the war, and ensuring Baekje's wealth and military strength.
And my zeal.
Is that so?
Yes.
Then, so be it.
I belong to His Majesty.
You're His Majesty's servant and also his brother, General.
As a General, how can there be any personal feelings between us anymore?
You are so wise, General.
You should in future, strive your best to be a loyal servant to His Majesty.
I want to forget everything.
Now, I've forgotten everything.
What's left now, is the smell of blood from the war, and ensuring Baekje's wealth and military strength.
And my zeal.
When I think of you, it feels like a huge rock is pressing on top of my chest.
The weather has turned cold.
If these clothes can protect you from the wind, will this ease my heart a little?
I hope that you'll be safe in the war.
This is my wish for you.
Eun Go.
Have you seen Gye Baek?
Yes, by chance.
You must have felt very emotional?
I did feel emotional, but the feeling was just towards a General, who has matured and become more capable.
It's no longer as simple as him being a capable General.
In my opinion, he has become the monarch of Baekje.
How is that possible?
The General is not that kind of a person.
I'm not saying Gye Baek behaves like a monarch, but that all the soldiers treat him as if he's the monarch.
Your Majesty, how can you say that!
Baekje's generals and soldiers only look to you as their monarch.
Yes, and does my wife also look upon me as her monarch?
Your Majesty, I am your woman.
Please don't bring up the past to doubt my sincerity.
Listen carefully Gye Baek.
Yes, Your Majesty.
This is my expedition.
Gye Baek will be the Sidoek and lead the attack on the city.
Your servant, Gye Baek, accepts the order.
His Majesty's order, let's set off.
Yes!
what map is this?
We obtained this map from Deok Sol's messenger.
Because of Gye Baek, Silla has lost it's southwest border.
If Gye Baek were to attack this city, then Silla's northwest border will fall too.
It will cut off the only access to Tang.
Then Silla will be completely isolated.
That's right.
But it's not possible for Gye Baek to take over Danghang City that soon.
Silla will increase its resistance, if it's an important place.
It's not because of Silla's resistance, but because His Majesty's resistance will make things difficult.
He has taken Gye Baek's lover, and even that was done on the sly.
He did it using deception.
You!
Will such a person allow Gye Baek to attack and capture his 40th city, Danghang?
If that should happen, then he'll be more venerated than His Majesty.
Will he allow this to go on?
This is a matter of national interest.
Will His Majesty behave in that manner?
If I can become weak over the issue of a woman, then how much weaker will a person be over the issue of a man?
His Excellency Jang Son, the envoy from the Tang court, has arrived.
Let's go together.
You should go by yourself.
I don't want to see that old man.
Welcome Your Excellency Jang Son.
You must be very tired from your journey.
Seong Chung and Heung Su, both are likened to the arms of Baekje's new king.
It's really nice to meet you.
His Majesty has just returned from the border, therefore I have to do the honours of welcoming you.
Please take a rest first at your embassy, His Majesty will grant you an audience later.
Apart from me, there's another important guest here.
Who is it?
Chun Chu Gong.
Chun Chu Gong has been awarded the title of Gwang Rok Sa Gyeong by His Majesty, the Tang Emperor.
-= Gwang Rok Sa Gyeong: 3rd highest rank among officials. =- Chun Chu Gong has been awarded the title of Gwang Rok Sa Gyeong by His Majesty, the Tang Emperor.
-= Gwang Rok Sa Gyeong: 3rd highest rank among officials. =- It's not an award from Silla.
-= Gwang Rok Sa Gyeong: 3rd highest rank among officials. = = Gwang Rok Sa Gyeong: 3rd highest rank among officials. =- It's an award from the Tang that carries the status of an envoy.
It's been a while since we met, Seong Chung.
When you came to Silla you were a deok sol, but now you've been promoted to a jwapyeong.
It's such an impressive rise.
I'm so flattered, but this is nothing compared to a title awarded by the Tang court.
Did you say Gim Chun Chu is here?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Since he came with the status of a Tang envoy, we can't drive him away.
What should come has finally arrived.
Gim Chun Chu has come here to seek his own death.
Silla seems to be anxious.
But now, shall we kill the small fry or the big fish?
General, all our preparations are ready for launching the attack.
Because of our early arrival by a day, the enemy has started to panic.
Give us your order, General.
The leaves and grass in and around the city is dry.
At this time, the north-easterly wind will be blowing.
Use fire to attack.
Yes, General.
Why are you suddenly talking about fish?
What are you saying?
No, who is the big fish, and who is the small fry.
Who should we kill first?
Let him wait at the embassy.
Someone, come in.
Are you looking for me, Your Majesty?
Get ready to go out covertly.
Where are you going?
I want to go to the area outside the South Gate.
Yes.
What's the matter?
Is the Magistrate in?
Exactly who are you?
Villain!
It's His Majesty the King.
Quickly, go and inform them!
From the taxes paid by the nobility, the taxes collected from the commoners seems to have reduced drastically.
It's due to Your Majesty's management.
What is the situation in the prison?
There are 3 criminals, the guilt of 2 has been established.
The other one, we have yet to establish whether he's guilty or not, for a decision to be made.
We can't find an innocent person guilty.
Bring him here, and bring the records as well.
We still can't meet him yet?
Even with the late King, such a situation never arose!
We are envoys from the great Tang!
Please try to understand.
His Majesty's concern for his people, and his need to keep an eye on their well being, takes priority over everything.
Shouldn't such matters be left to the government officials?
His Majesty cannot trust the words of the officials.
Officials will not reveal their own wrongdoings.
Don't you agree, Chun Chu Gong?
You are right.
His Majesty will be returning to the palace very soon, please go back and wait.
We will notify you.
Ui Ja seems to be doing much better than I expected, if I'm not wrong.
It seems to me also.
But no matter how good is he in administering to the needs of the people, if he can't manage Baekje's hero, Gye Baek, he cannot become the true monarch.
For the sake of Silla, I will definitely ensure Gye Baek perishes at the hands of Ui Ja.
You are well?
Welcome, Your Excellency, Jang Son.
There's also Ui Chan, no, that's not it.
You're here as a Tang envoy, is it Gwang Rok Sa Gyeong?
We haven't met in a long time, Your Majesty.
When you came to Silla not long ago, our hospitality was deficient.
I apologize for that.
I remember in detail your hospitality,
I will reciprocate that hospitality well.
Then, in the light of your lofty position as the Gwang Rok Sa Gyeong, what brings you to Baekje?
It can't be you want to discuss the 39 cities that we've captured?
It's really unfortunate about the cities, but for the sake of peace, we can give them up.
Did you say peace?
Yes, my intention in coming this time is to discuss a peace treaty with His Majesty.
Really!
Your stance is different from before.
I wanted to apologize to Your Majesty much earlier.
Apologize?
When Your Majesty came to Silla seeking a peace treaty,
I misunderstood your intention because of the matter concerning Seobuk City.
The matter concerning Seobuk City arose because of General Gye Baek's defiance of the royal edict.
If I'd known that, our two countries would have forged an alliance long ago.
Don't say insincere words.
Looks like I can't deceive Your Majesty.
Then let me tell you my real purpose in coming here.
An angler will not go fishing without bait.
What's your bait?
Let me first ask this of you.
Do you wish for Gye Baek to capture the city?
To take back the lands Silla has taken away, is Baekje's wish.
Don't pretend you don't know.
I knew long ago about Gye Baek's intention to attack Danghang City.
Is that so?
With the strength that Baekje posseses now, it won't be easy to capture Danghang City.
But...
There's an easier way to capture the city.
If you were to join forces with Goguryeo.
Presently, the person holding power in Goguryeo is not the king but the naesin jwapyeong.
I don't know about anything else, but the military forces will still take their orders from him.
Is that so?
He has said that in the near future he might drive the king out and ascend the throne.
If Gye Baek were to join forces with him, then capturing Danghang City won't pose a problem.
But I'm worried.
Is this Your Majesty's intention or is this Gye Baek's intention?
Gim Chun Chu, now I can clearly see your purpose in coming here.
You're here to drive a wedge between Gye Baek and me.
You're trying to tell me that Gye Baek will become like the naesin jwapyeong of Goguryeo, and that I should be on my guard.
Do you think that I, Ui Ja, am so stupid as to be so easily manipulated by you?
Calm down Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
I'm telling you this because I don't want any more wars between us.
Isn't Silla your mother's homeland?
If you agree, I'll hand over half the city to you.
If we do that, then the soldiers won't have to shed blood in a battle.
Your Majesty will be able to acquire the city in a peaceful manner.
This will be Your Majesty's achievement.
Your Majesty.
Come here.
It's fine, you can speak.
General Gye Baek has succeeded.
Yes, where is he going to?
To Danghang City?
Yes, Your Majesty.
He was able to see through your ruse of trying to drive a wedge between him and Gye Baek?
Yes.
So, your sole purpose in coming here has failed.
We'll see.
Are you confident?
Sometimes the mind and the heart are not united.
Ui Ja will definitely be wary of Gye Baek.
Mencius once said this,
"If we nurture our magnanimity, it will grow to fill the earth and heaven."
"If that magnanimity is tempered with justice, then it becomes more righteous."
Is it difficult?
It is a bit difficult for Your Highness.
I'm sorry, teacher.
Then I'll find something easier.
You've worked hard.
You're here early, Your Majesty.
What did you learn today?
I'm learning the philosophy of Mencius, Mother.
Is that so?
Did you understand it?
His Highness, the Prince, is very intelligent.
If I enlighten him on one matter, he's able to grasp ten relevant points.
Is that so?
Yes...
You want to bring forward the Crown Prince's installation?
His Majesty had to go through a lot of hardship previously because he was not conferred the status of Crown Prince early on.
That was one of the reasons.
We can't make the same mistake again.
Compared to Queen Sa Taek, Eun Go is more crafty and cruel.
You're father's disciple and also the Prince's teacher, and are like an uncle to him.
Please protect the Prince.
Fine.
In order to avoid chaos arising in Baekje, we should do that.
The Queen is discussing the installation of the Crown Prince with naesin jwapyeong?
Yes.
He's better now.
It's only a fever, he'll be much better tomorrow morning.
You've worked hard.
Is he better?
Yes.
His constitution is so weak.
Sit.
Gim Chun Chu came to drive a wedge between Gye Baek and me.
Of course.
Because Silla have been losing their battles with General Gye Baek, of course he'll do that.
But...
Gim Chun Chu is a stupid person to think that Your Majesty is so small-minded.
No.
For a moment I was taken aback.
How did he know I was envious of Gye Baek?
The one who captured the hearts of the people, and yours.
Your Majesty.
That matter is long past.
Furthermore I've already borne your child.
Do you still not trust me?
All right, I understand.
Your Majesty could give up everything for the sake of saving me.
It's fine to hate me, but don't extend your dislike to the child.
He's my pitiful child.
To live contently the life of a normal Prince is fine too.
Also, to dabble in politics will only be exhausting.
I don't want my child to go through what I experienced.
Yes, you're right.
The position one so desires, is sometimes like sitting on a mat filled with needles.
That's why I envy Gye Baek.
To be able to ride on a horse.
Congratulations on your successful capture of the city.
All of you have contributed greatly to this.
I will record your credit.
I don't know whether among those that you mention, one other person will be included.
Whether all of you will remember at the General's table, me, Dok Gae.
What?
Who are you talking about?
What have you really done, for you to speak in such a manner?
Dok Gae!
What have I done?
And, why must you always sing a different tune from me?
Why are you saying I've not contributed any effort?
Do you know in an inhabited place, how important eating, drinking and excreting is?
I've even organised for the soldiers' sanitary needs, and done a very good job at that.
Only by my efforts can we have a clean and hygienic camp.
Just think, if this was faeces, faeces all over here.
Is this hygienic?
If we see faeces when we're eating, is what we're eating food or faeces?
That's why, only by my efforts, is this place kept clean and hygienic.
Therefore no infectious diseases can spread.
Don't you know that infectious diseases are more deadly than wars?
What Dok Gae says is correct.
Your deed is indeed not miniscule.
See, even the General acknowledges my contribution.
That's enough.
We're assigning you the most important task.
All right.
Waste matter?
General!
General?
The following city is Silla's fortress.
It's also a link to the rest of the country, and an important hub for Silla.
If we succeed, then Silla will not be so arrogant.
If we succeed, you will all become great soldiers.
Are we going to lead the forces?
See, see.
Showing off again.
Why must you lead, you should be at the rear, the rear.
General, why don't you give me a chance to lead?
Let me lead this time.
I'll give you a more important task.
What?
Go to Goguryeo and meet up with the naesin jwapyeong.
Naesin jwapyeong?
Go and meet him and hand over to him my letter.
Silla is well aware of the importance of this city.
Their defence will not be the same.
Therefore, without the help of Goguryeo, we will not be able to succeed.
General, a letter has arrived.
What is the content of the letter?
It says to stop our attack and to return.
Wasn't an edict already issued earlier?
Why is he asking us to go home?
Has His Majesty given up on Danghang City?
Silla has proposed that we manage Danghang City jointly.
What are your opinions?
What is your Majesty asking?
It's not necessary for us to do that.
Danghang City is Silla's only access to Tang.
As long as we're able to capture Danghang City, this will be like grasping Silla's weakness.
But, if we were to manage the city jointly...
Yes, if we follow the momentum set by General Gye Baek, we'll succeed in capturing Danghang City.
Reject Gim Chun Chu's proposal, and ask him to go home.
No,
I'm going to accept Gim Chun Chu's proposal.
For a moment I was taken aback.
How did he know I was envious of Gye Baek?
Even though we were able to capture so many cities because of Gye Baek's tireless efforts, it's time we let the soldiers have a good rest.
It's better for us to utilize the city together.
If an opportunity should arise in the future, we'll seize it then.
This, in a way, is good for us too.
If we were to seize the city in a rush, those who resist will not just be a few.
Your Majesty, General Gye Baek has sent a letter.
But, Gye Baek says he can't come.
He says if we don't attack Danghang City now, it'll be difficult to find another chance.
He tells me to wait.
He tells me not to be too anxious in forging an alliance with Silla.
Who is the monarch of this country?
Is it me, or Gye Baek?
Please remain calm and collected, Your Majesty.
Didn't you tell General Gye Baek to act using his discretion?
Didn't you tell General Gye Baek to act using his discretion?
General Gye Baek is reporting what's actually happening on the ground to Your Majesty.
Give this to Gye Baek.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Isn't that a bu jeol?
-= Bu Jeol: an item used to command troops or serves as an order to transfer troops. =- Isn't that a bu jeol?
-= Bu Jeol: an item used to command troops or serves as an order to transfer troops. =- If Gye Baek still refuses to return after receiving that, then he'll be defying a royal edict.
Why is His Majesty behaving like this?
Gye Baek will be wondering what major crisis has arisen and will return.
In my opinion, he's trying to eliminate the roots of calamity.
His proposal of mutual utilization of Danghang City is a good idea, but his proposal makes me distrustful.
His Majesty recalling Gye Baek, do you think he has anything else planned?
Apart from this matter concerning the alliance, are there any other matters?
We can't say for sure.
His Majesty had entertained the idea himself, but he's now fanning from the side.
Are you looking for me, Your Majesty?
Have a seat, Cheon Dan Ryang.
Can you answer me using God's prophecy?
Of course.
Is Gye Baek, Baekje's brightest and most dazzling star?
No, Your Majesty.
No?
Even the children in the street know that Gye Baek is the most dazzling star.
If it's not Gye Baek, who is it?
Baekje has 3 bright stars.
Among these 3 there's one who shines the brightest, but it's not Your Majesty's.
It's not mine?
Your Majesty, don't misunderstand what I've said.
Your Majesty was never one of the stars to start with.
Your Majesty is the vast sky.
The stars will protect Your Majesty.
With the presence of the stars, nobody can harm the sky.
But if the sky cannot safeguard the stars, then the stars will turn into meteors.
If the sky doesn't want the stars anymore, then the stars can only fall?
Your Majesty.
Do you know of the Qin Dynasty?
Emperor Qin Shi Huang believed his generals had conquered the Huns.
But, Emperor Li Xie did not believe in them.
He killed them.
Li Xie was forced to commit suicide thereafter.
I can be Qin Shi Huang or Li Xie?
For an emperor, there's nothing comparable to having capable generals and a strong backing.
There is also no greater threat than this.
Only if one is able to overcome such threats, can one be a true monarch.
You must be determined in this.
Did His Majesty really ask you that question?
Yes.
That's bad.
Distrusting your own men and wavering.
Do you know when a person starts having doubts?
It's the time when he loses his own self-confidence.
You must place your trust in His Majesty.
Only when you protect the sky, will the sky not come to any harm.
Only then can the stars shine.
Your Highness!
What is the matter?
This...
I don't know how to tell you.
What's wrong?
It's him.
He's a young professor, living a very extravagant life.
I heard from the nobility he was taking bribes, so I did a bit of investigating.
But it's not that...
What did he do, that he's being tortured?
It started with a rumour that he was taking bribes.
I did an internal investigation.
In his premises,
I found this.
How did you get hold of this?
Matters concerning our life and death.
How did it come into your hands?
Your servant was only complying with the order.
Complying with the order?
I think this financial record book...
-= Financial Record Book: a record of all money transactions paid and received. =- I think this financial record book...
His Majesty had just approved the investment for Sobu.
Confess now, who directed you to do this?
That...
If you don't answer my query truthfully,
I'll cut off your tongue and dig out your eyes!
I'll turn you into the living dead.
Yes!
Yes!
Who was the person who directed you to do this?
The order came from His Majesty, of course.
Did you say His Majesty?
Yes.
That's utter nonsense!
In order to save me, he gave up everything.
How could he have done this?
That's the real truth, Your Highness.
Please believe me.
His Majesty allowed me to use that to incite the students to file a complaint to the late king.
But, I can only think of one way to save you.
Say you're pregnant with a dragon child.
Your Majesty, you can't kill Eun Go.
You can't kill a woman who's carrying a dragon child.
This is all my doing.
I'm begging you to spare her.
She's a woman who's more precious to me than my own life.
You villain, you deserve to die!
Do you know that because of that one matter, many people had to die.
I am sorry.
I only did what His Majesty directed me to do.
I only did what an official ought to do.
Your Highness, calm down!
Get out of my way.
I'm going to take revenge for my family today.
Your Highness, please spare me.
As long as you spare me, I'll do anything.
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
General, we've received a letter.
Gim Chun Chu has arrived in Sabi City.
Gim Chun Chu.
I guess he's the one who arranged for me to be recalled.
Going to Yeongya, what shall we do now?
Make a trip there secretly.
I know.
Greetings!
Greetings!
Long live the General.
Greetings!
Greetings!
Greetings!
Greetings!
I've made a great contribution!
Look at me!
Look at me!
Look at me.
Look.
Why did I decide to walk?
Because I didn't agree to ride on a horse.
Grandmother, look at me.
Grandmother.
Your servant, Gye Baek, complying with Your Majesty's edict, has returned home.
Welcome home, my loyal servant.
My beloved brother, Gye Baek.
I can't believe this.
Why did His Majesty, why did he do such a thing?
Are you really not aware of the reason?
I don't know.
No, it's something I can't even imagine.
Just think about it.
If that petition of complaint didn't exist, would Your Highness' fate have ended up like this?
I guess you'd have ended up beside General Gye Baek by now, but Your Highness, because of that matter, ended up on the verge of death.
You were able to escape from that crisis, by saying you were pregnant with a dragon child, and have now become a royal consort.
It's all because His Majesty wanted to have you.
His Majesty is that kind of terrible person who desires absolute control.
Gye Baek.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Don't address me in that manner.
It's only the two of us here.
Just call me hyeong.
Before you capture Danghang City, you said you won't drink wine.
You won't have just one cup?
I'll accept your gesture, but you must tell me all that's hidden in your heart.
Fine.
Your Majesty, why did you recall me just when we were about to launch our attack?
Is it because you don't trust me?
Or are you afraid I'll become like Yeon Un Maeng, and become someone who'll manipulate Your Majesty?
What are you really suspicious about me?
What is this?
Even if this is a private and personal conversation between two sworn brothers, you must still watch what you say.
The person who's in front of you is the king of the country.
It's all right.
He must ask.
Before he came, his heart was bursting with curiosity, wondering about the reason.
Of course he must ask about it.
Gye Baek, Gim Chun Chu said, if you were to unite with Yeon Yun Mun,
Danghang city will be mine.
But if I were to unite with Gim Chun Chu,
Danghang city will still be mine.
No matter how we go about it, Danghang city will be mine anyway.
Therefore, there's no reason to have bloodshed.
You've suffered greatly during that period.
How about taking a rest?
General.
Don't participate in tomorrow's meeting to be held in the morning.
The general who refused to drink had too much to drink today.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
It's not something Your Highness should worry about.
Why shouldn't I worry about it?
Don't you have any idea at all?
You must be on your guard against His Majesty.
His Majesy is envious of you and everybody who follows you.
Because of envy, there's a possibility he might snatch it away.
Envy me?
If it's something that can be snatched away,
I'll give it to him first.
So you would have done the same with me?
You would have given me up too?
What are you saying?
It was His Majesty who saved Your Highness.
Instead, I was not able to do anything.
If the person who saved Your Highness was me.
Your Highness and I, we almost became fugitives for life if we'd escaped, if I had been the one who saved you.
Do you regret it?
Isn't it that Your Highness did not have to disappear?
So, you're able to appear before my eyes now?
That's enough for me.
No matter what your place is in life,
I'm happy as long as you're alive.
It's fine as long as I don't have to listen to such words anymore.
Why did you come back?
You saw Gye Baek and had spoken to him.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, you are a leader who trusted your officials, am I right?
Of course.
Are you asking because of Gye Baek?
You don't have to worry.
Gye Baek is one of my officials, he's my brother,
Since he's my brother, how could Gim Chun Chu pull him away.
Therefore all the other officials will have no doubts and will trust and abide by Your Majesty too?
Yes that's correct.
Furthermore, Your Majesty had for the sake of this country and the people, and the loyal ministers, reckons that moral principles should be more important than anything else, am I right?
Why are you behaving like this?
Why are you stating the obvious?
Are you saying that you don't believe me?
No, I believe Your Majesty.
Your Majesty had treated me very well in the past.
You're the person who battled everything to save me.
You are so bewildering!
What is making you behave like that?
It's because I'm grateful.
There's one more thing that I'm grateful for, for taking care of General Gye Baek.
General Gye Baek is seeking an audience.
You've finally come.
Are you looking for me, General?
I came to say one sentence to you, Chun Chu Gong.
The reason why Chun Chu Gong came to Baekje
I know it clearly.
But there's one thing you ought to bear in mind clearly,
His Majesty and I, Gye Baek, no matter what scheme you have, will definitely not waver.
That was really unexpected.
I've come to ignite the fire.
I fear that you will annex our Silla.
Even if I have to give up half of Danghang city,
I had to come to impede your actions.
The person I fear most in Baekje is you, General.
Even if I have to meet you face to face, and feel my back getting numb.
Gim Chun Chu.
Even though I can kill you right now,
You chose to enter the tiger's den in your bid to save your country, I'm moved.
I'll spare you your life.
But remember my face clearly.
The moment you see my face on the battlefield, that is the day of your death.
That is the day Silla will be obliterated from the face of the earth.
-= Next Episode Preview =-
What's the reason you wanted to see me?
Do you reckon who among the two princes will be sent here?
Do you think I will accept this transaction?
Who do you reckon, among the two princes, will become the Crown Prince?
Just because you don't like it, you want to discard it?
Calamity will befall the royal court.
How now shall we deal with Gim Chun Chu, Your Majesty?
Of course we must kill him.
We can't do that.
Are you the king?
What matter brings you here to see me?
If we do it that way, it's even more strange.
There's no way we can act in concert with His Majesty.
I harbour too much hate against His Majesty.
All because of me, sworn brothers have betrayed each other.
Because
General.
General, news has come from the general at the frontier.
Tang's army of 130 000 are not heading to Goguryeo, but towards our Baekje.
Your Majesty, what are we going to do now?
The Tang's navy is 130 000 strong.
Do we have the ability to stop them?
We have less than 60 000 troops even if we add up our regular troops, the private soldiers and all those who have surrendered.
How can we defend when we don't even have half the number of troops that they have?
Jojeong jwapyeong, fighting a war is not just about the number of soldiers.
Furthermore, we have a counter plan ready.
Why are you intimidated even before we start?
Is there still no news on the movement of Silla's forces?
Your Majesty,
Gim Yu Sin has arrived in Namcheon district with 50 000 soldiers.
Namcheon district?
Not Seorabeol?
Seems like they took advantage of the darkness to mobilize their soldiers.
Your Majesty, what was the counterplan left by former jwapyeongs, Seong Chung and Heung Su?
Seong Chung and Heung Su said, if Tang and Silla were to join forces, we must first attack the Tang troops at Gibeolpa, then turn our attention to the Silla troops in Tanhyeon.
If we do that, then they can't march to Sabi City immediately.
And also, we must make all the necessary preparations in advance to protect Sabi city.
-= Tanhyeon : in Okcheon county area in the North =- -= Gibeolpa:
Seojeon county area in the South =-
Further, we must prevent their troops from uniting, as this will buy us time.
-= Tanhyeon : in Okcheon county area in the North =- -= Gibeolpa:
Seojeon county area in the South =-
Isolate the Tang troops who'll be arriving from the sea route so that their food rations will run out.
If the Silla army cannot unite with the Tang troops, they'll have to retreat in defeat.
Preventing their troops from uniting will decide the victor and the loser of this war.
How prepared are our armed forces?
We have 23 000 in our main forces, and if we add all the rebels who have joined us, we'll have 60 000.
What's the best way to prepare for this?
The Tang forces are strong, there'll be 30 000 of our troops going to Gibeolpa.
There'll be 20 000 troops to stop the Silla forces and 10 000 to guard and protect Sabi City.
Will our defences hold?
They should be sufficient to defend our position.
Good.
All of you ministers listen carefully.
I too was dubious about the Tang army coming by the sea route, but now that worry has turned out to be a fact.
The country is now facing its biggest crisis, but our Baekje will be able to overcome this.
All the noblemen with a private army, please lend a helping hand.
Yes, Your Majesty.
General, you'll be responsible for Tang's navy.
Yes.
Our defensive system at Gibeolpa has been completed.
It won't be easy for the Tang navy to come ashore.
First, attack the troops who try to come ashore, then focus on defending.
How long do we have to resist them?
10 days should make them anxious.
In that time I'll capture Silla, and secretly attack Tang from the rear.
At that time we'll go on the offensive together.
That's a very good strategy.
-= Silla army camp =-
We're moving across Jinnaeeul county today to Tahyeon.
-= Jinnaeeul county: present day Chungcheongnam-do, Geumsan-gun area =-
Heum Sun and Sin Rok will lead the left wing.
-= Jinnaeeul county: present day Chungcheongnam-do, Geumsan-gun area =-
Cheon Jong and Jin Ju will be in charge of the right wing.
-= Gim Yu Sin. =-
I'll be responsible for the main army.
Yes, Great General.
Please keep this in mind.
10 days later, we must reunite just before Sabi city with Seol Jeon Bang.
Yes.
-=Seol Jeon Bang:
Tang's military leader for the joint forces=-
You are here, Your Majesty, Your Highness Crown Prince.
You have worked hard, Great General.
Seol Jeon Bang has left for Gibeolpa.
We just have to make our move.
Everything is ready.
The person whom General wanted to see so badly, Gye Baek, has come to us.
-= Gim Chun Chu.
Silla's 29th king. =-
I'm really worried.
If Gye Baek is wise and make the right decision, he will know that it's more difficult for them to defend themselves against us compared to defending themselves against the Tang navy.
He will definitely come out to fight.
Furthermore, Gye Baek also wants to fight with me.
We should avoid the strong, I really don't understand General's views on warfare.
Great General, when will Tang be sending their large army?
This is a godsend opportunity for us.
We must definitely capture Sabi city to wreak vengeance and redress the wrongs done to us.
Don't worry, Your Majesty.
Thank you, I believe in you, Great General.
What did you say?
The noblemen had fled before handing over their private army?
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.
These people deserve to die!
When the country is peaceful, they'll be living off the people's hard work and flee when the country is in crisis.
Then what about the rebels, those who joined the army?
The rebel soldiers were with the private soldiers.
A large number have also disappeared with the private soldiers.
So who have we got to defend against the enemy?
Your Majesty, although it's difficult but we must not lose our faith.
Even though the noblemen have cowardly fled when they heard about the massive forces of the enemy, but if they see us resisting courageously, I believe they will then release their soldiers.
Is there any way for us to succeed?
Since we lack military personnel, wouldn't this render Seong Chung and Heung Su's strategy useless?
We will have to rethink and adapt that strategy accordingly.
We'll take out 10 thousand troops from the 25 thousand troops in the central army to guard and protect Sabi city.
And General Ui Jik will have to use 12 thousand troops to resist the Tang navy.
But if we do that, you will only be left with 3 thousand troops, General.
Are you going to use just that to defend against 50 thousand Silla troops?
We have about 2 thousand volunteer soldiers in the whole country.
Although this is inadequate, but we'll try our best to stop them.
With that number of soldiers, it'll be difficult to face them directly.
But that doesn't mean we have no solution.
We'll have to take a step back and station ourselves in the vicinity of Ungchi and make use of the canyon to fortify our defence.
As long as we stand guard from there, no matter how many Silla soldiers were to come, it won't be easy for them to defeat us.
Then let's do as you say.
Your Majesty, we've completed our preparations to go to war.
Gye Baek.
In retrospect, Heaven has given me a very valuable gift.
He gave me Seong Chung, Heung Su and also you.
But because I had discarded you previously
I am now paying a price for what I had done.
Don't blame yourself, this has not ended yet.
Your servant together with the people will defend this country against the enemy.
Your Majesty, as the monarch, you have to remain here.
I will.
The participation of the people in the political council, and also the well-field system,
Seong Chung's, Heung Su's and your vision too, we have to achieve that.
My younger brother, you must live and return alive.
Make sure you come back and together we'll make that vision a reality.
I will.
The Tang has brought its 130 thousand strong army.
Silla has brought its 50 thousand strong army.
Isn't it a foregone conclusion that we'll die?
You useless fellows, you should start waking up now!
General, even if is General Gye Baek, how can 5 thousand soldiers take on 50 thousand troops?
Yes, this is like asking us to go and die.
The noblemen have fled, why should we have to go and die?
You bunch of...
Who's going to die?
Who are you saying is going there to die?
We can win.
We must win!
These pitiful fellows, why must you be so stubborn?
You have come.
Is the General not out yet?
He has gone to see His Majesty, he'll be coming out shortly.
Everything has ended, look at their morale.
Is that the face of a soldier who is determine to go to war?
You're going to die, going there to die, just follow me and leave.
If you want to leave, just leave.
We will stand or fall with the General.
I'm also sad.
Very sad.
But you should stand or fall with me, because the both of you are still young.
Inform the General when he comes out, he must make a trip home first, please tell him that.
It's imperative that you do so.
I will do so.
Your servant is going to the battlefield now.
Nobody will be able to forgive Your Majesty's sin.
But if we should overcome this crisis,
I can beg the people to forgive you.
Please therefore learn to love and respect yourself.
Please don't treat me as someone so shameless.
Now, my wish is just this, that there won't be another woman like me.
General.
I'm in pain because of you and yet my happiness comes from you too.
I hope you'll be safe and sound.
Please take care of yourself, Your Majesty.
Why are the soldiers morale like this?
That... was because our numbers are too low compared to the enemy.
Listen!
I do not want all of you to die in the battlefield.
You are all Baekje's warriors.
As Baekje warriors, how can you be intimidated by a mere 50 thousand soldiers?
Even though we don't even have one tenth the military strength of the enemy, there are many deeds you can perform in this war.
Lift up your head.
I, Gye Baek will be with all of you.
Wait here for me.
You are here.
What are you doing?
I'm also defending my country against the enemy, that's why I'm like this.
What do you mean by that?
Don't tell me you want to go to the battlefield?
The battlefield is here.
The battlefield is here... what do you mean?
General,
I've been killed in the battlefield.
So kill me first before you go.
My wife.
The morale of the 5 thousand soldiers you're taking with you is like that of soldiers who had already been defeated.
If you were to go to war like that, you will only lose.
You must lead by example, General.
If General were to behead me, it will only mean there's no return except to fight.
Only by doing that, you will raise their morale to fight a life-and-death battle.
My wife, I know your intentions, but this is preposterous.
Come, get up quickly.
General, are you confident you'll win if you go out like this?
Do you really think you can save Baekje?
I have no further desires and I won't be dead, because I'll live on forever in your heart.
My wife, I beg you not to do this.
Why are you behaving so cowardly?
How can you boost the soldiers morale if you don't take my life.
The people of Baekje will be subjected to insults.
Quickly, hurry up and kill me.
Please, I beg you, don't say anymore.
Do you want me to do it myself?
My wife...
General if you don't take my life, I'll still do it to myself when you leave.
I'll wait for you there, General.
I'm very happy.
My love.
Please kill me.
What's the matter?
Where is the General?
The General he...
General...
What is the matter?
General, he... killed his wife and children.
What?
He killed his wife and children?
That's right.
That...
He did that because he has decided he won't be returning.
General!
General!
General!
Get up.
Get up everybody.
Let's set off.
Yes.
General!
I've managed to obtain the information.
Report.
Silla's army has an estimated 50 thousand soldiers.
Gim Yu Sin must be leading them.
That's right.
And also...
Jin Ju, Cheon Jon, Pum Il, and Heum Sun are following closely behind.
There is also Crown Prince Beop Min with 200 young Hwarangs.
(Hwarang - "Flower Boys", elite group of male youths in Silla)
Where are they now?
Currently passing by Tanhyeon.
We will encounter them very soon.
We won't enter the city.
We will mount our defence on the open thoroughfare.
What does that mean?
If we don't enter the city that means we'll have to confront them head-on.
How can these officers and soldiers fight against the enemy when they are outnumbered ten times?
No,
General is correct.
We should enter the city if we're on the defensive.
But now they are on the offensive, in this situation, if we were to enter the city, it'll mean we're making way for them.
That's right.
You have read the situation correctly.
We'll just defend from here, Hwangdeungyasan-gun.
-= Hwangdeungyasan-gun :
present Nonsangildae region. =-
General, you take some men and go to another intersection.
All right.
You do the same thing, take some soldiers to another intersection.
The rest of the troops will come with me to the last intersection.
Yes, General.
These intersections, are not easy targets for them to mount an attack.
The enemy can only launch a direct confrontation.
They can only come with the whole brigade.
But Gim Yu Sin is aware of this as well.
This is a good place for us to secure our defence.
As long as we use the square matrix formation the enemy will be unable to do anything.
-= Square matrix formation : arranging the troops in four corners as a defensive measure. = = Square matrix formation : arranging the troops in four corners as a defensive measure. =-
General.
This can hold them off once or twice, but
I know what you want to say.
But this time, we're not trying to win the war.
We're just trying to prevent Silla and Tang forces from uniting.
If we can ride out the storm on this occasion, we'll have a chance to turn things around.
Before the arrival of the Tang's forces, as long as we can still move, we can't put down our weapons.
Yes, General.
Reporting.
Gye Baek is leading 5 thousand men and has set up a battle formation up front.
It's a mere 5 thousand men.
My cavalry needs only attack once, and they will scatter like sand.
You have battled with Gye Baek more than once.
How is it that you still do not understand this person?
Even with their small numbers, they can rely on both sides of the canyon and strategically block the path.
It won't be easy to break through.
Why are you not resting?
General.
It's not necessary.
Sit down.
Where are you from?
From Jeokcheon county.
-= Jeokcheon county : present day North Jeolla province. =-
It's a village that sits on a rocky area.
It's very beautiful.
That's right.
Your age is so advance, why are you still coming to the battlefield?
My son died five years ago in a battle with Silla.
My wife died when she heard the news.
After that day, I held my weapon, and if I were to die in battle, I'll be able to see my wife and son.
Don't die, your wife and son wouldn't want that.
General, it's very difficult to take revenge using an old sword.
Sleep for a while.
This is really cool and refreshing.
Dae Su.
Yes.
I've always had a yearning everytime when I come to battle.
If I were to go back riding a horse then I can see the smoke billowing from the chimney,
that would be my best trophy.
How can this just be your yearning alone, hyeongnim?
Yes, you're right.
If we can give this to the people here, that would have been great.
General.
Army!
Advance!
General.
Wait.
Just a little more...
Release the arrows!
Release the arrows!
Kill all of them!
Do not pursue!
General.
Gim Yu Sin!
I had always thought you were a true and honourable Silla man.
I never thought that you would go begging the Tang to send an army to rescue you.
Don't you feel ashamed?
Just try and see.
Give it your best effort!
Don't mention the Tang.
Even if reinforcements from all over the world come to support you you will still be defeated by my sword and those of the Baekje generals.
We have a thousand dead and a thousand five hundred injured.
Gye Baek.
You villain!
General.
Seol Jeon Bang who led the attack against the Baekje army had annihilated the Baekje forces.
He's attacking the capital city now.
General, this is really good news.
That's right.
Now a piece of Baekje's wall has fallen.
General, what's wrong?
I'm so helpless.
If we're unable to reach the capital city by tomorrow,
Seol Jeon Bang will have more demands to ask from us.
So do you still think this is good news?
Silla's future is in our hands.
We must get past their defence.
We must cross their defence line, no matter what method we employ.
No matter what.
Yes.
General Ui Jik... has died in the line of duty.
Now Baekje's future lies in our hands.
Is there still no news concerning the reinforcements?
Yes, now that General Ui Jik has been defeated, things will become doubly difficult.
The hopes of the people now rest on our shoulders.
We must not die in vain.
Even if we lose this place, we must still treat this as Baekje's foundation.
Do you understand?
Yes.
General!
Yes.
General!
Eat a bit more, keep your spirit up.
Yes, we must drive Silla out from this place.
We will be victorious.
Spirit up.
Yes, of course.
We must remember how General Gye Baek killed his family so that we can be victorious.
Yes.
General.
I am sorry.
This is sufficient for me.
Don't think of saving the food, let the soldiers have their fill.
Yes, General.
Please have some.
It's very sweet.
The troops morale is very high.
When they first saw the enemy's troops who outnumbered us tenfold, their hearts were filled with fear.
After winning a few battles, the soldiers morale has been sky-high these days.
It's all thanks to your great efforts in fighting well.
Do you know what the soldiers call you?
They called you the blessed general.
Since General is known as the blessed general, you will definitely live.
Correct, we must make sure you return home.
And if possible to send everyone home to their families.
General, what is the matter?
Our casualties have risen to 11 thousand in just two days, they're still at the mountain pass and have not advanced a single step, -= Gim Beop Min :
Gim Chun Chu's son.
Silla's 30th king. =- does this even make sense?
Night offensive, direct confrontation and all-round offensive, we've tried everything.
The Baekje villains are risking all they have in their defence.
Is that even an excuse?
We are an army of 50 thousand troops.
They have only 5 thousand.
So Your Highness, would you like to take over your servant's command?
Uncle, Seo Jeon Bang is threatening His Majesty if we don't arrive on the date as agreed,
They have gone to the extent of demanding for Silla's territory.
Let them do it!
Anyway, to go to war with them won't be harder than fighting Gye Baek.
We've gathered all the soldiers to mount the attack on the mountain ridges.
Look for a breakthrough.
General, they've broken through.
Gim Yu Sin is currently crossing the estuary.
General.
Go and stop then at Hwangsanbeol.
Quick!
Yes.
We are fighting an all-decisive battle.
Why are you doing this?
Your Highness is already here to meet Gye Baek, why do you still want to avoid him?
Seol Jeon Bang is waiting for us.
Gye Baek is Baekje's last bastion.
Even if we have to meet up with Seol Jeon Bang if I were to go by avoiding Gye Baek, people will laugh at me, Gim Yu Sin.
We will proceed with a head-on confrontation.
General.
General is right.
I will seal off the enemy's escape route.
That's not necessary.
Step back.
Just like being bitten by a rat, you can only experience it once.
Didn't I tell you to step back?
-= Hwarang Gwan Chang =-
Nobody is to go.
I won't fulfill your wish to die.
To make use of others to die on your behalf,
Gim Yu Sin, there's no difference between that and avoidance.
General.
His words are not wrong, but, you can afford to lose in a contest, on the battlefield, isn't winning everything?
General, the reinforcements and the private army are starting to come out to assist.
Is that a fact?
Give me a report on their movements.
The troops from the North and the Northwest are currently heading towards Sabi city.
Those from the South and the East are heading towards here.
Not just this, but the number of common people who wants to protect the country is rising rapidly.
All of you have heard!
The reinforcements are currently rushing here!
Look at that, that villain again...
No matter what, you must not kill him.
He must be captured alive.
Yes.
Move back!
Kill me!
Seize him.
Those who killed our people, we will not spare even one.
General!
General, why are you doing this?
Please get up.
Please get up quickly!
Warriors of Baekje,
I take great pride in you.
You are all here at Hwangsanbeol.
You have faced enemies that outnumbered you tenfold, and have won four great victories.
Great warriors of Baekje!
I have deep respect for your bravery and your loyalty.
I bow in admiration.
And I, Gye Baek, today, once again orders everyone...
Do not die.
You must stay alive.
Today, at least, do not fight for your country.
or fight for your names to go down in history.
You also don't have to fight for the king or for me.
You only need to fight to return to your parents, your wife, your children, and your brothers at home.
Only if you survive... will the road back home, through today's victorious win, be opened.
Long live General Gye Beak!
Long live!
Long live!
Baek Ji warriors.
Charge!
Charge!
Yong Su!
Yong Su!
Yong Su!
Yong Su.
General...
Yong Su...
Naesin jwapyeong!
Did you implement the order that I laid down previously?
To distribute the lands to the people?
Only if they own landed property, can they continue to survive.
We must reduce the number of people who're homeless.
Now, the handicraft industry continues to provide them with work.
Within a year, the people will be either farmers or craftsmen.
They can then hold on to property.
Your Majesty, urgent report.
What is the matter?
Silla's Gim Yu Sin has attacked Seodeok City.
All our 5 000 soldiers were annihilated.
General Ui Jik is also gravely injured.
Go to the village, and bring Gye Baek here.
Can we really bring Gye Baek here?
Gye Baek, bring him over.
-= Episode 32 = = Episode 32 =- Dae Su.
Yong Su.
Give me a bit of food, I'm starving.
Looks like you're really going to persevere all the way.
We should emulate you.
I knew it.
If he is as resolute when he does other things, then our country will grow strong.
I know, give me some food, I'm hungry.
General.
My apologies, we have nothing much to offer.
What are you saying?
Isn't our village herbal drink the best there is?
Isn't that so?
Of course.
This drink tastes really good.
I'm going to prepare lunch now.
Don't take the trouble, we'll leave after saying what we came to say.
Can you let us have a few moments together?
Is His Majesty looking for me?
Yes, he is.
His Majesty is looking for you.
Seems like the country is not in a peaceful state.
Although His Majesty is a dictator, he's quite good at managing the country's internal affairs.
The problem lies in foreign affairs and border garrisons.
Out of the 40 cities that you captured previously, Gim Yu Sin has recaptured 30 of them, and they recaptured Seodeok City yesterday.
The problem is serious.
We don't have a general who can hold Gim Yu Sin off.
If we don't contain Gim Yu Sin, won't that put Sabi City in danger?
And also, His Majesty will sever all diplomatic ties with Tang soon.
Gye Baek, let's go.
If the situation is not critical, why would His Majesty recall you?
I won't be going.
Yes, I know how you feel, but it's not because His Majesty is summoning you.
But Gim Yu Sin has already taken the lives of 50 000 soldiers.
If you do not return, more people and soldiers will die.
Please protect them.
Hyeongnim, you are also aware (Hyeongnim - respected older brother) if I go and protect our soldiers and the civilians, and accumulate more merits, the palace will get more nervous.
I don't want to experience it again.
The situation has changed.
His Majesty will not be jealous since it concerns the survival of the nation.
You'll understand once you meet His Majesty.
I do not wish to see His Majesty.
Please excuse me, I have to continue with my farm work.
Are they asking you to return to the battlefield?
That's right.
Looks like our country is facing a crisis.
Are you afraid that I might go back?
No, it's not that.
My going back may cause more chaos.
Don't worry, I won't leave this place.
How did it go?
Yes, I should have known.
He hates me so much, why would he still come back?
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.
Seong Chung, Heung Su.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Do you still think that I'm a dictator?
That's right.
Right.
Without the political council meeting to control me, it's of course a dictatorship.
Let me ask you another question.
So, am I implementing a system of dictatorship, and are my people living in hardship?
The issue is not whether you're a dictator or whether the people are living in hardship, it's that the policies which you think are right, may not necessarily be right for the country.
I've abolished the political Council meeting controlled by the noblemen, the same noblemen who were intimidating the people.
Are there no virtues in a dictatorship?
Your Majesty abolished the council meeting not because you wanted to suppress the noblemen, you did that to strengthen your own imperial powers.
So no matter how good the outcome is, sometimes the process is more important than the outcome.
You can't be a tyrannical king.
Therefore, you can't have a dictatorship that's seemingly virtuous.
Just like the harmony in yin and yang, a dictatorship that doesn't allow any opposition, is clearly wrong.
Just like we have brilliant shining stars in the sky because of the dark night.
Light and darkness are not antagonists, but are complementary to each other.
So no matter how good my governance is, I can't be a dictator.
So what is Gye Baek to me?
Is he the darkness that allows me to shine, or am I the light that allows his darkness to stand out?
Your Majesty, Gye Baek is neither light nor darkness, instead he's your precious sword.
If Your Majesty holds that precious sword and uses it to save the people, when the people heap praise on that sword, their praise will spread to the holder of that sword, that is Your Majesty.
Also, when you hold that precious sword in your hands, you would not have thoughts of the sword backstabbing you.
The precious sword that I hold in my hands?
Then I shall quietly go and pay a visit to that precious sword.
Your Majesty, where are you planning to go so late at night?
To find my precious sword.
What precious sword?
There is such a sword, but I don't know if it has rusted yet.
-=Hwang Deung County, Heuk Fortress=-
It is still as peaceful here.
The hands which used to wield a sword have now changed to holding farming tools, but it suits you.
Have you been living well during this period of time?
I've not been living well.
You have already heard from Seong Chung and Heung Su, haven't you?
Tell me directly.
National matters are of the utmost importance.
You wouldn't be fighting for me, you'd be fighting for Baekje and the people of Baekje.
I came here on Your Majesty's orders.
Your Majesty told me never to set foot in Sabi City again.
I won't make any excuses, you are the person whom I feared and envied the most.
I thought that I could still achieve everything without you.
That's always been the case, it will be the same in the future.
I thought domestic affairs would be reasonably quiet.
Our borders are about to collapse, we need you.
Your Majesty has already killed me.
You should go back.
I will promise you anything.
After that you'll take everything away from me, right?
If you hadn't threatened my existence, things wouldn't have turned out that way.
I've never been a threat to you in the past.
Your Majesty was the one.
It's your heart that posed the threat, and turned me into your enemy.
Don't say anymore.
Yes, I did it to myself.
I, who didn't trust my father, didn't trust my friends and my officials.
And finally, I didn't even trust myself.
Isn't that why, after driving you out, I've come to seek you out again.
Mother, Mother.
You're here.
You're hungry, I'll finish the washing immediately and cook for you.
We're going to play.
Be careful.
Yes.
Let's play together.
Even His Majesty came.
Do you think we'll be going back into battle?
No, we shouldn't trust His Majesty.
He'll definitely try to harm the General again.
It's good you came, very good.
Let's go quickly.
General Gye Baek has returned?
Yes.
It must be His Majesty who summoned him.
It must be His Majesty.
It's because the border is collapsing that he became fearful.
He's fearful the court may once again be in turmoil.
His Majesty has grown much older.
Do you really want to raise those proposals with His Majesty?
That's right.
Otherwise, we can't break through this impasse.
The royal court will once again be hit by tunderstorms.
(be thrown into turmoil)
It won't be as easy as you think.
No matter how difficult it will get, this is the only way that will be effective.
Yes, right.
If we add all our Baekje soldiers together, they won't even reach 50 000.
What is worse is the perception of failing again.
In this kind of situation, the people won't join the army.
Recruitment will not be easy.
Even if a Baekje hero were to step out?
Wasn't that a matter in the past, ten years ago?
Now the people and the soldiers will be sceptical.
Moreover, the country has gone through many changes in ten years.
Even your stories have now become legends.
I wonder how His Majesty will react when you present your proposals, especially your final proposal.
There's a possibility, that not only will His Majesty reject it, but he may be furious when he hears it.
If he doesn't accept it, I'll just go back.
I hope that you've been well, Your Majesty.
Looks like the end result is His Majesty is still the loser.
It's your servant who lost, to the people.
You haven't changed at all.
What is stranger, that I didn't change or I've changed?
I'm doing this for the sake of the country and the people.
Is that so?
I'll wait and see then.
You want to re-establish the armed forces from scratch?
Yes, Your Majesty.
The soldiers defending the frontier presently are not playing an effective role.
Even if were to go to war, we couldn't expect to win.
We must first minimize the number of soldiers protecting the rear, and put all the others around the border.
If we do that, won't there be a problem with law and order locally?
We must now focus on the crisis at the border, and not worry about anything else.
Those defending the capital and the palace, and also the royal guards, must now be moved to the border too.
If we do that, won't the palace be in danger?
What shall we do if there's internal strife?
Also, if the enemy break through our frontier, they may head straight to our capital city.
All strategies are accompanied by risks.
But General, we don't even know what may happen to His Majesty's palace, in case...
We'll act according to Gye Baek's wishes.
You have other proposals?
Yes, Your Majesty.
From now on, the soldiers from the history department and the royal guards, will be at the forefront.
And all Silla prisoners who are agreeable to enlisting in the army will be released, to join the Baekje army.
In future, we're not to execute the Silla prisoners.
They are all highly trained soldiers.
If they're willing to become Baekje soldiers, this will help to increase our shortage of soldiers in a short period.
Let's do that.
Confirmed?
Confirmed?
Have you confirmed it?
Stick it properly.
We must give some benefits to those who volunteer to enlist in the army.
Exempt them from paying tax, according to the number of people who enlist.
Let's do that also.
Do you have anything else?
Are those all the proposals you have?
My final proposal...
Speak then.
Please give me your permission to meet Yeong Gye Somun.
Meet Yeong Gye Somun?
Why?
Even if we send all our soldiers to the frontline, it may not be sufficient to tilt the victory in our favour.
Your servant wants to meet Yeong Gye Somun to discuss launching a joint attack on Silla, and if possible, I want to contact the Huns too.
Will Yeong Gye Somun agree to your proposal?
Although I can't give you a guarantee, I'll try to convince him.
That's an indefinite answer, but if you think that's the best way to go about it, then go ahead and do that.
We are humbled by your grace.
It's unbelievable that His Majesty actually listened to General Gye Baek's words.
He has never conceded an inch when it comes to military matters.
This is equivalent to giving the General full control of the army.
Looks like His Majesty has had a change of heart.
Do you think His Majesty expected this?
I don't know, it could be the fact that Gim Chun Chu has now become the king of Silla.
His Majesty killed his daughter and son-in-law.
It's possible that he's worried about Gim Chu Chu taking revenge.
The current batch of Baekje soldiers aren't as good as the previous ones.
What's the matter, my wife?
Why are you dressed like that?
General, Yeong Gye Somun hasn't sent any message yet.
That's right, he hasn't replied to my message.
Looks like I'll have to meet up with him personally.
You want to go to Goguryeo personally?
We'll meet at the border.
Then, can't I follow you there?
You want to come too?
No, you can't.
It's too far, and too dangerous.
Have you forgotten I've met Yeong Gye Somun countless times before?
My experience can definitely be of help to you.
Fine then, we can finally ride together.
Your Excellency!
We can see Baekje's military camp.
Looking back, I was really incredible.
I... what did the Silla soldiers call me?
Baekje's God of the Earth.
Why?
Because they can't see me.
They thought I came and went through the ground.
There's one other matter,
I...
This man is Baekje's hero, even the Silla subjects know this.
The moment they hear me coming, they run and hide.
Some even wet their pants.
Have you all seen this before?
Never.
You can't tell from the looks, but it has a smell, the smell of sex appeal.
It's to that extent.
I rode my horse over there.
In just a few moments, dozens of Silla cities were gone.
I just hold my knife like this, and a dozen people will die.
I am that fast.
Such a famous person,
Dok Gae.
Hero Dok Gae.
You must have heard of Dok Gae.
I...
Never in my life.
This is the first time I've heard that name.
Your first time?
That is possible.
But now you've heard, in future just spread the word about me.
Dok Gae.
Do you understand?
Keep it in mind.
Is General Gye Baek in?
What?
Is he here?
Who are you, that you're looking for our General?
An important guest has arrived.
Ask him to come out.
An important guest is just a guest.
Why are you asking our General to come out?
How important is the guest?
Get down!
Fine, fine!
I'm injured.
Let go of my arm.
What's the matter?
General,
It's General Yeong Gye Somun.
Gye Baek?
Are you General Gye Baek?
I didn't expect the Great General of Goguryeo to come here personally.
I was about to go and meet you.
I heard that military discipline is low.
General has also grown old already.
The way I see it, looks like my trip is in vain.
Your Excellency!
Your joke is making me fearful.
But General, your insolence and defiance, are more formidable than the rumours.
I heard you've been driven out for ten years already.
I thought you were dead.
You're still alive, what's your secret?
My secret is the power of endurance.
If you don't eat, you'll be eaten, that's power.
Something even a three year old child is aware of, don't you know of it?
It must have been difficult to stay alive.
How would a rebellious servant know the path taken by a loyal servant?
Rebellious servant?
Our monarch, in the presence of the Tang Emperor, in disregarding us, offered our city first to the Tang Emperor.
But, when I rejected that, the Tang Emperor then came with a million troops to protect our Goguryeo.
I knocked out one of Li Shimin's eyes.
When all is said and done, who is loyal and who is rebellious?
No matter how great your contribution, it cannot offset the crime of revolt.
You're not in any position to say that.
You're seeking our assistance to help you fight Silla.
How can you provoke my anger?
Looks like you don't know the art of negotiation.
I cannot continue to negotiate with an arrogant person such as Your Excellency.
You're still the same old General Gye Baek, who is still so unyielding in my presence.
I want to have a good fight with you.
To have a good fight on the battlefield.
But... just like this, we've forged an alliance.
Your Excellency has defeated Tang, causing them to retreat, and also caused Li Shimin to lose an eye.
How can I be compared to you?
You don't have to be so modest.
How can I not know a tiger when I see one?
You'll be a worthy opponent in a fight.
That day may come.
In our next life.
Our objective in this war is to lure Gim Yu Sin out.
This time, if we don't dispose of Gim Yu Sin, then, our Baekje and Goguryeo, will be embroiled in war again.
That's my thinking too.
As long as you appear on the battlefield, he'll definitely come.
If you hear of Gim Yu Sin making an appearance, inform me immediately.
I will be there at once.
If Gim Yu Sin should appear in Baekje, you must inform me immediately too.
He is a dangerous man.
If we don't kill him, both Goguryeo and Baekje will be in danger.
Among the three of us, whoever lives the longest will probably become the final victor.
-= Silla, Seorabeol =-
Your Majesty, the joint military forces of Baekje and Goguryeo have arrived near our border city.
They have also brought a small number of civilians.
Border city!
-= Gim Chun Chu.
Silla's 29th King =- It wasn't that long ago, but they've now arrived here?
How can we suffer consecutive defeats?
Your Majesty.
-= Gim Yu Sin =- Please calm down.
The alliance between Gye Baek and Yeong Gye Somun has raised the enemy's morale very high.
Let me go personally.
Great General.
Are you able to handle both of them?
It won't be easy.
If you were to fall, then our Silla will be thrown into a major crisis.
Your Majesty.
Don't worry.
Your servant will definitely defeat Goguryeo and Baekje, and return victorious.
Great General.
You are our pillar.
You must definitely come back alive.
Don't be bothered by any criticisms regarding bravery and timidness.
If things aren't going well, return immediately.
I won't ask you about your sins.
Do you understand?
Your servant will comply with your order.
Gim Yu Sin has crossed Gwiryeong.
Maybe tomorrow, or the day after, he'll reach Seolryeon Mountain.
He'll be setting up his camp there.
We'll go there.
Yes, General.
General,
Urgent report.
Gim Yu Sin, after suffering an attack by Yeong Gye Somun, has retreated.
Where did he retreat to?
General, what are we going to do now?
Yeong Gye Somun will definitely be pursuing Gim Yu Sin.
Gim Yu Sin, in order to avoid Yeong Gye Somun, will change his route, but where will he go?
He told us about Namsan City, which he's attacked before.
They'll be launching an attack there.
Tell them to get ready to ambush.
Yes, General.
We must capture Gim Yu Sin before Yeong Gye Somun.
Yes General.
Although everyone is tired, just bear with it for a while longer.
Once we pass this mountain, it will be Gwiryeong.
Yes, General.
General,
As expected, Gim Yu Sin's troops are here.
That's good.
Let's ambush his soldiers.
Yes, General.
Gim Yu Sin,
I've been waiting for you for a long time.
Just surrender.
You!
I will not surrender, even if I were to die.
You're very despicable.
How so despicable?
Do you think you've cornered me?
I just pretended to lose to Yeong Gye Somun.
You just caught him in pursuit of me.
Don't utter rubbish.
Just surrender.
I'll regard you as a prisoner of war.
I regarded you as my enemy, but I released you.
If I had wanted to kill you, I could have done so.
If I take you for a real man, I'll feel ashamed.
You really want to live.
Fine.
I'll just treat it as repaying the debt I owe you.
General, are we going to let him go just like that?
Put down your weapons.
Gye Baek.
Now our debts have been cancelled.
Our next meeting will decide the victor and the loser.
Don't beg me when we next meet.
-= Baekje, Sabi City =-
Your Majesty.
Victory!
General Gye Baek has recaptured Gayaesom City, which was seized by Silla.
Your Majesty.
This is really a great victory for us.
At present, we've recaptured 33 of the cities we had lost.
Now Silla should stop eyeing our country.
Did Gye Baek mention what will be his next move?
He said he's sending all the injured troops home first.
And also...
He'll rest for a few days and then head back to the battlefield.
This is all Your Majesty's credit.
Yes, Your Majesty.
This is Your Majesty's honour and glory.
There's no God of War.
Inform Gye Baek and the troops,
I will go out and receive them personally.
That Gye Baek was able to win battle after battle is very fortunate.
He is once again the hero of Baekje.
Really...
Whether it's this or that, it still worries us.
His Majesty went through a lot of trouble to bring Gye Baek back, I think this time things will be different.
How can we trust His Majesty?
To us, is this good or bad?
It's good.
Now Silla will have to rely on us.
We must push for the installation of the Crown Prince.
Write a letter to Gim Chun Chu.
Yes.
-= Silla, Seoraboel =- I'm too ashamed to meet you.
I was so worried.
Gye Baek kept winning battle after battle, and so did Yeong Gye Somun.
It's not easy.
We had better rely on Tang for assistance.
Your Majesty, on the battlefield winning and losing will go back and forth.
Even though the morale of the enemy's troops is very high now, as long as we can hold their attention, there'll be opportunities for us to succeed.
That's the only important thing.
This is the report sent by Baekje concerning Goguryeo's troop movements.
This will probably be helpful to you.
According to Tang's message to us, they'll now start to invade Goguryeo.
If this happens, Goguryeo will retreat.
The problem is Baekje.
As long as Gye Baek is around, it will be difficult.
Do you have any ideas, Great General?
If we know Gye Baek's troop movements, things will be much easier.
Then before you begin, let's think of a way to get information about Gye Baek's movements.
Then we have to put forward our condition.
No, we have already grasped their shortcomings in our hands.
If they don't tell us, we'll report them as spies.
General, what order did His Majesty hand down?
He told us to make some plans.
Then, are we going back?
That's good!
Right, we've been working so hard.
We can have a good rest when we go back, and we can also see our children.
This is great, really great.
It's great.
Wait, let me go and tell the soldiers.
What are you doing?
What do you think you're doing?
I'm afraid the same thing will happen again.
I'm also very worried.
I really don't want to go back.
They don't know anything, this is something good.
What's wrong with it?
We will not go back.
So what shall we do with the bu jeol?
-= bu jeol: a symbol issued by a ruler to generals, envoys, etc., as credentials =-
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I have to go to the palace.
Why did you return alone?
The situation in the border is still not stable.
It's difficult to manage the soldiers.
Are you worried about me?
Afraid that I'm suspicious of you.
Should I say I'm thankful, or should I say I'm sad?
I'm so sorry, Your Majesty.
How did you both know Gye Baek was here?
I told them.
Your Majesty.
Compared to a grand celebration, how about us having a small celebration by ourselves?
That's a good idea.
Your Majesty.
What shall we do?
He's just like a fox!
I'm so sorry, Your Majesty.
Of course you should be fearful.
This is the heinous crime of selling the country!
Not only towards me, jwapyeong, you should also be fearful towards Baekje.
Because of you, I'm going to become a heinous criminal now.
Your Majesty, please kill me.
I'll take responsibility for everything.
Gim Chun Chu, I shouldn't have trusted him.
If matters take a turn for the worse, I'll take full responsibility.
No matter how they torture me,
I'll say this has nothing to do with Your Majesty.
That this villain was the mastermind of everything.
Your Majesty, it's Gong Ji.
Come in.
General Gye Baek is now at His Majesty's residence.
You've saved me.
No, you have saved Baekje.
You don't belong to me, you belong to Baekje.
It's fine, I've promised with my life.
I will step out again.
But, it's not because of your edict.
I will only protect the people, and will only abide by their will.
And also, don't even harbour a bit of suspicion against me.
If you do that, I'll step out again.
My father died because of you.
But, I won't sacrifice my life for you, I'll only do it for Baekje.
I'm asking you for the last time, can you promise me that?
I'm asking you for the last time, answer me honestly.
Are your words said with sincerity?
Is it really sincere?
I will guarantee it with my life.
Gye Baek, you should do more good things in the future.
Not for my sake, but for the people's sake.
That's not it Your Majesty, self satisfaction is all I need.
Do you both think like that too?
That's right.
No, it's heart-warming.
Yes, it brings back old memories.
General, congratulations to you.
Why are you here?
I was just passing by.
It must be a very warm feeling, that 4 sworn brothers can sit together.
If I were to join in, will I be intruding?
Have a seat.
All those who used to oppose the Sa Taek clan are present here.
Without all of you, I wouldn't have been able to come this far.
General, where will you be attacking next?
We are all very curious about your next move.
It's a secret, so I won't be telling.
Is that so?
Then it's better for me not to know.
No, Your Majesty.
Actually, I want to start my offensive starting with Tobi City.
Is that so?
I don't know if we can succeed.
You will definitely succeed.
The two jwapyeongs sitting in front of us, naedu jwapyeong and naesin jwapyeong, will help you come up with a great strategy.
Your servant has done nothing Your Majesty, but, General Gye Baek's tactics aren't bad.
He will surely succeed.
I'm really looking forward to it.
What strategy you'll be employing, I'm dying to know.
This time, the time and day of General Gye Baek's attack on Silla, and also our strategy, make sure to convey this without a mistake and tell them about our conditions.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Because of this matter, we have to give up Tobi City to Silla.
This loss is so painful, I'm so angry.
Don't worry, we're only gifting them one city.
First, we must make sure Prince Hyo is installed as the Crown Prince.
That is so, right?
How long more must I play along with Gim Chun Chu?
Convey this to General Gim Yu Sin.
Yes, jwapyeong sir.
-= Silla, Seorabeol =-
You have worked hard.
If we manage to destroy Baekje, we'll reinstate your position.
That position will be a key one.
Yes, General.
Make sure the Baekje court do not discover this.
I will remember that, sir.
Father, are you giving those to us?
Yes, your late grandfather, also made a similar wooden scupture for me.
I know, this is oppa and this is me, am I right?
Yes, our Hyein has guessed correctly.
Are you leaving tomorrow morning?
I'm sorry, I can't be by your side.
You shouldn't be, I'm the one who should be sorry for not being able to be by your side, just like the way I accompanied you in the past, General.
You're already watching over me now.
Because I have a place to come home to, that's why I can return from the battlefield alive.
Please come home safely, that is my one and only wish.
You've returned quickly, General.
Having to guard this camp this period, all of you must be tired.
Please don't say that.
I've also taken charge of the soldiers' discipline.
I've secured this camp.
Did you meet His Majesty?
That's right.
Did he welcome you?
Gather everybody, we are going to hold a strategy meeting.
We're going to focus on the offensive that we're going to launch on Tobi City.
We'll attack the city's sides 3 times.
The strategy is to trick the enemy 3 times.
So when is the actual attack?
Well...
I'll tell you that on the day itself.
Just how secretive is it?
The people here are all your men, General.
Is it because you don't trust us?
This is really sad.
Where are you going?
That is also a secret.
I trust all of you, but because this involves the lives of tens of thousands of our troops, we cannot afford to make the slightest mistake.
Yes, we understand General.
General, let me do the scouting on Silla's troops.
I'm counting on both of you.
Yes General.
General,
Baekje's army is here.
Leave them be.
What?
During this period, no matter what they do, just leave them be.
They're just on a scouting mission.
Tell the soldiers.
Yes, General.
Wild Wolf, this is our real battle.
How is it that there's not even a slight reaction?
There's not even a single rat.
Could it be it's empty?
If it's empty, we're in more danger.
Let's go back first.
It's really strange.
Don't go inside.
Shoot some arrows and see.
Yes, General.
Why is it so quiet?
It's really strange.
Really, really strange.
Seems like they know our strategy.
Is Gim Yu Sin a ghost?
It's an attack!
It's an attack!
Defend!
Retreat!
Retreat!
General, we're sorry.
We were ambushed by the enemy.
Our troops were almost annihilated.
Does Gim Yu Sin know our strategy?
We were unaware of their ambush.
Kill us.
No, it's all my fault.
I've underestimated him.
Because of me, we've lost many soldiers.
Gye Baek should be crying.
Your Majesty.
Your servant, abiding by Your Majesty's decree, went to Tang.
You have worked hard.
Did Tang say they have once again rejected our Queen's bestowment?
No, Your Majesty.
Your servant has now obtained Tang's consent to the Queen's bestowment.
Is that true?
Yes, Your Majesty.
This is really strange.
All along they haven't agreed, but why suddenly...
Yes, you're right.
Your Majesty, now Your Majesty has become a real Queen.
My sincere congratulations to you, Your Majesty.
Congratulations, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, urgent report.
What is the matter?
General Gye Baek's troops were attacked by Gim Yu Sin and lost Tobi City.
What?
Gye Baek lost a battle?
Yes, Your Majesty.
I really can't believe this.
The never-once-defeated Gye Baek has been defeated.
What's the cause that resulted in them being attacked?
This is really strange.
This couldn't have happened unless intelligence was leaked.
That's my thinking too.
But didn't Gye Baek say that he'd only issue the order on the day of the attack itself?
Even if there's a spy, they couldn't have brought forward the ambush.
It can't be...
General, where will you be attacking next?
We are all very curious about your next move.
It's not possible.
Why would the Queen do that?
It can't be.
We have overstepped the boundary.
The Queen's bestowment at this time is too much of a coincidence.
And hasn't Gim Chun Chu been deliberately obstructing this?
Just because of this, she betrayed the country?
It can't be...
That can't be it.
As you ordered, we've prepared everything and can leave tomorrow morning for the Temple.
No, we'll go to Mi An Temple.
I want to see whether he has really become a monk.
I want to see for myself.
Master Myeong Jin!
Her Majesty is here.
Welcome, Your Majesty.
I'm the abbot in charge here, my name is Su Wol.
I'm Myeong Jin.
-= Episode 17 =-
Why is Myeong Jin not here?
He was here just a moment ago, but in the blink of an eye he disappeared.
- Go and look for him immediately.
- Yes.
Why, why didn't you ever tell me?
My original plan was to send this child to the village once he was born, but I never thought things would turn out like this.
So what should we do now?
If they know, they won't let the child live.
I will think of a way to get him out.
Please help me.
Then let me protect him.
That won't do, you're the Queen's guard.
How can you possibly leave this place?
What if the Queen looks for you?
Matters will get more dangerous if she starts suspecting you.
I'll explain to her, give the child to me.
-How did it go?
-I've searched everywhere, but still couldn't find him.
Have you tried looking for him at Hae Dang's residence?
I haven't had time to look there.
I'll take a look there personally.
Lead the way.
Quickly, Wife.
Wife!
You must promise me... that I will definitely see this child again.
I promise.
You must also believe in Gye Baek.
He will take him to a safe place.
You must bring this child back to me later on.
Your Majesty, what brings you here?
What brings you all the way to Hae Dang's residence?
I heard that master Hae Dang was sick, and therefore came to see her.
I came to take care of her.
Is that so?
Then I'd better go in and take a look.
It's not necessary for Your Majesty to do that.
It's my fault.
I wasn't able to welcome Your Majesty.
Please forgive me for my rudeness.
You look very unwell.
I'll call the physician to take a look at you.
Your Majesty, the pharmaceutical division has been attacked.
What happened?
Don't worry.
I was attacked by an unknown person.
It was the guard who saved me.
Where did Seungri go?
He went chasing after that person.
-=Hyungsu :
Murderer/ Person who commits evil deeds.=- You go and give chase as well.
Be sure to catch the hyungsu.
-=Hyungsu :
Murderer/ Person who commits evil deeds.=- Yes.
Why did the criminal attack you?
Can you think of anything suspicious?
Even though I can't confirm it, recently I heard there's a conflict between the Japanese merchants and my merchants.
It was probably them who sent that assassin.
Why didn't you tell me about this earlier?
I didn't want to trouble you over a small matter.
Your Highness, we plan to hold a discussion at Baek Hwa Ru's tomorrow night.
There are people who intend to petition His Majesty to appoint a Crown Prince quickly.
Thank you to all of you.
I won't forget the favour that all of you have done for me.
Isn't that the sound of a baby crying?
- Go and take a look quickly.
- Yes.
Over there!
Grab hold of him!
Grab hold of him!
Grab hold of him!
Isn't that Gye Baek?
How can such things happen?
Heaven is blind.
How can they be so merciless?
Don't blame yourself.
I don't know whether you want to hear this, but this is also his fate.
Ga Ui.
Don't die.
You can't die.
Baby, baby, I'm sorry.
It's nuna's fault.
(Nuna - older sister)
To let you become like this, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry baby.
I'll never do that again in future.
So, please open your eyes!
He's alive, my dongsaeng.
(Dongsaeng - younger brother or sister)
I cannot believe my eyes.
A child who had been dead was brought back to life.
How did such a miracle happen?
This is truly a good omen.
It's extremely auspicious.
Ga Ui.
Don't worry about things here.
Leave before the Queen becomes suspicious.
Yes, I understand.
I heard what happened in Mi An Temple.
Are you all right?
Yes, Father.
Fortunately my injury isn't that serious.
That is really fortunate.
But I thought you were no longer in charge of the merchants?
For them to try to kill you, is really surprising.
The criminal has yet to be caught, am I right?
Yes, because of that, I plan to go back and carry out an investigation.
You've been frightened, go back and rest.
Yes, Your Majesty.
She seems a bit suspicious.
This sudden assassination has never happened before.
Just think about it.
The eve of Yeon Mun Jin's rebellion, and the escape of the captives, she was the only person at the scene.
This area of suspicion is not just once or twice.
It's best to do a thorough investigation.
Are you saying that even she cannot be trusted?
There's no harm in being more careful.
- Who's there?
- It's me, Nam Jo.
Report Eun Go's every move to me from now on.
Yes.
The message from Baek Hwa Ru states it'll be tomorrow at midnight.
It was sent by Prince Gyo Gi.
I don't care whether Gyo Gi is sending the meat, or the meat is sending Gyo Gi.
So, just like this...
It's really from Prince Gyo Gi.
What do you think?
To go, or not to go?
Why are you asking unnecessary questions, just go.
This is an opportunity.
This is our golden opportunity.
Think about it carefully.
Don't just eat and listen.
(means don't just sit and do nothing)
Think about it.
Let's just annihilate the ferocious Wi Je faction.
If Prince Gyo Gi were to see that, what will he think of us?
He'll want to retain us, and make us his subordinates.
What is there to think about?
Do you think by doing that we'll be fine?
Even if we tell Prince Gyo Gi it was us who did it, isn't it a fact that we did it together with them?
Was there someone else?
Who?
Why is it I can't remember?
Wasn't it just us who did it?
As long as he doesn't appear before Prince Gyo Gi, then the Prince won't know of it.
As long as we don't say anything, that will do.
Who do you think he could be?
Moreover, when we were trying to to kill the members of the Wi Je faction, we were unsure then whether they were friends or enemies.
How can you be so stupid!
How can my troops be my enemy?
We must first hold on to Gyo Gi, and head towards a bright place.
Our future will then be secured.
A bright place.
Let's drink a toast to Prince Gyo Gi's coronation.
Cheers!
Your Highness, congratulations!
Congratulations!
Congratulations!
I, Gyo Gi, am grateful for the loyalty you have all shown.
I won't forget all of you who are here today.
I will have your names recorded in a list of heroes, and will later bestow upon all of you senior positions.
And all those people of stature who are in the Palace, it's also important to bring them over to our side.
- So everybody should put in their best efforts.
- Yes.
I've invited him here according to your orders.
Let him in.
He's the guard from the Queen's Palace, Seungri.
To be recently appointed the Queen's guard, isn't that a better position than being a guard to the governor?
When did you even manage to bring the guard over to your side?
No, he's not one of my people yet.
No matter how I try to persuade him, he won't change his mind.
Isn't Her Majesty your mother?
Someday you will be crowned as the Crown Prince.
Why are you so impatient?
Your servant will act as if I've not seen all of you.
You're clearly here.
Today, you won't be able to run away.
I'll definitely put you in an important position after my ascension to the throne.
So from now onwards be my follower.
Don't let him move even one step.
It's you again.
Do you know each other?
Yes, we're somehow connected.
Who is he?
He's the Queen's guard.
The Queen's follower?
I called both of you today because I need a group of warriors.
My final proposal.
If you reject it, I'll kill you right here.
What's your answer?
Of course I will align myself to you.
Why would a person from the Queen's Palace want to exterminate the Wi Je faction?
Didn't you say the Wi Je faction is your enemy?
So why are you on Prince Gyo Gi's side?
What is your true identity?
Are you friend or foe?
I want to ask you the same question.
Why didn't you tell Gyo Gi about me?
Because I really want to know your true self.
Gyo Gi will become the Crown Prince, and he'll become the King.
He will become my stepping stone.
The Prince seems like he really wants you on his side.
To have a person like you to handle matters is always helpful.
Same here.
But you must be careful.
This isn't the place for small fry like you to fool around.
So, you've accepted Gyo Gi's proposal?
I had no choice in the matter.
If I didn't agree to it, my true identity would have been exposed.
Well done, that's great!
Don't make fun of me.
I was being sincere.
Why didn't you tell us earlier that Prince Gyo Gi wanted you on his side?
Even if he didn't bring it up, we intended to send you to him.
This is a godsend opportunity for us.
Think about it carefully, whether Prince Gyo Gi is fit to ascend the throne.
He's a small-minded person with big ambitions.
That's why the Queen delayed his investiture as Crown Prince.
But Prince Gyo Gi is too impatient to wait for the investiture, and has mistakenly revealed his own ambition.
As long as we can make use of this, we'll have unexpected opportunities knocking on our door.
The Queen is not an easy opponent to deal with, but Gyo Gi is not the same as her.
What you mean is to let them fight and kill each other?
Yes, that's right.
You're telling me now you can't endure this any more?
Yes.
You, bastard!
Are you trying to trick me?
Do you really want to die?
I've yet to obtain Your Highness's guarantee.
Guarantee?
What do you want?
First of all, please guarantee this.
You must be installed as the Crown Prince as soon as possible, and you must also ascend the throne to be King.
If one follows a general who lacks determination to be victorious, there will be no troops who'll go to war.
Don't you trust me?
I'm sorry, but compared to Your Highness now, in my eyes the Queen is more trustworthy.
If Your Highness can't give me a guarantee, how can I entrust my life to you, Your Highness?
Fine, I'll give you that guarantee.
I will surely be more powerful than my mother, and I will become the King of this country.
And one more thing.
If Your Highness were to ascend the throne, at that time, you must bestow upon me the position of a General.
There are many ambitious people.
Finally, it boils down to you eyeing the position of a General.
Is this your game plan?
In future, all information concerning what's going on in the Queen's Palace, I'll report it to you.
I'll become Your Highness' spy.
I can also manage the troops.
In the shortest time possible, we can mount a rebellion.
Don't you think that you must compensate me if I can do that for you?
Fine, I'll guarantee that you'll be given the position of the most senior general.
I am honoured.
Your servant will serve Your Highness with undying loyalty.
I have someone whom I'd like to introduce to Your Highness.
He could be your future Zang Ji Fang.
-=Zhang Zi Fang: the famous strategist who helped the Han Emperor unify the country.=- He could be your future Zang Ji Fang.
-=Zhang Zi Fang: the famous strategist who helped the Han Emperor unify the country.=-
Who is it?
Please come in.
Aren't you that person who made a fool out of me previously?
How dare you bring this person here?
Please remove your hand.
A person who wants to perform great deeds will get into trouble if they get agitated easily.
What did you say?
Your Highness, don't tell me because I handed the gown to Prince Ui Ja previously, that you're behaving in this manner?
Is it because you don't know that you're asking me?
I never expected Your Highness to be so narrow minded.
Scoundrel!
Please remove your hand and listen to what I have to say.
Fine, I'll let you justify your action.
If you dare to say one irrelevant word, your head will fall.
That day your servant gave the gown to Prince Ui Ja, was because I wanted Your Highness to become the Crown Prince.
What?
For Your Highness to become the Crown Prince, the most important matter is to know who is on your side, and who are your foes.
You can distinguish this clearly after that event.
I made my stand that day because of Your Highness.
I gave the gown to Prince Ui Ja because if anyone were to step forward and support me, that person would be Your Highness' biggest stumbling block.
I only wanted you to see that clearly.
Think about it carefully Your Highness.
Those who supported me that day, would be the ones who would hinder Your Highness.
Is it my mother?
When it comes to power, even between parents and children, it cannot be shared.
But no matter what, that person is my mother.
The Queen will wait until His Majesty's death.
Even if Your Highness has been installed as the Crown Prince then, she is not the kind of person who will hand over the reins of power to you.
If she doesn't hand over the reins of power to me, what do you want me to do?
Apart from me, do you mean there's someone else?
-= Regent:
A person appointed to rule the country on the King's behalf. =- She'll be the Regent.
If she was really a normal mother, she would recommended you be installed as the Crown Prince long before this.
But Her Majesty didn't do that.
What do you think that signifies?
Just now, did you say to install the Crown Prince?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Such words can even come out of your mouth.
Did Gyo Gi direct you to do it?
Even though he didn't ask me, it's not something that should be delayed any further.
But it's also not an urgent matter.
Gyo Gi still has a lot of weaknesses at the moment.
He hasn't been installed as one, but he's acting like he's the Crown Prince already.
If he's installed as the Crown Prince, then he'll be behaving like he's sitting on the throne.
How should we deal with that child?
If it worries you, it'll be fine if Your Majesty acts as Regent for a period of time.
That idea had crossed my mind before, but Gyo Gi is no longer a child.
He's now an adult.
There's no longer any provision for a regent.
In a short while, envoys from the Tang court will be here.
The discussion concerning the installation of the Crown Prince will arise.
But for a child who hasn't matured, there's no way we can bestow that title on him.
Eun Go.
Yes.
My position is such a position where I cannot trust anyone.
The me in the past, in order to protect this position,
killed the person whom I loved.
Thereafter, I made the decision not to give in to my feelings any more.
Eun Go.
If it was you, what would you have done?
To be able to reach this position, it's necessary to abandon one.
If it was me...
If it was me, I would choose to abandon this position.
You don't seem to understand yourself very well.
You would also abandon your lover, and hold on to power.
It's the same with me.
If the time to make such a choice were to present itself again,
I'd still make the same decision, and abandon my lover.
Eun Go had sent us a letter.
She's having a lot of difficulty persuading the Queen.
So we still have to use Prince Gyo Gi to make a breakthrough.
It's elder's turn from now on.
I know that already.
Your Highness, this is Im Ja, a respected merchant.
What's your reason for wanting to meet me?
What other reason can there be for a merchant wanting to meet Your Highness.
Of course it has something to do with your ascension to the throne.
What are you saying?
His Majesty is still healthy.
You dare to say such a thing!
Your servant doesn't know how to talk in a roundabout manner, so I'm going to speak in a straightforward manner.
Your servant is of lowly origins.
I've always been oppressed by those merchants who come from the nobility.
I've never been able to get a foothold in the capital.
This time, I want to risk my all, and depend on Your Highness.
What can you do for me?
The Tang envoy will be here shortly.
Shouldn't we seek his favour, to undertake to help in your installation as Crown Prince?
Therefore...
Come in.
These have been made by Baekje's most talented craftsmen.
In addition to this, we have readied ginseng and dried persimmons.
We've also readied herbal medicines and spices.
Whatever you need, just let me know the quantity and items.
And as for the workers, how many do you need?
All these are our Baekje's well known products.
These will make very appropriate gifts for the Tang envoy.
I'm very satisfied with them.
This is really great.
For Your Highness's sake,
I can pledge all of my property.
I hope Your Highness can take me in as one of your people.
Of course I must do so.
You're indeed a wealthy merchant, with great sincerity.
Now it's your turn, Your Highness.
All right, what shall I do?
Seek an audience with His Majesty and tell him all our plans.
Convince him to work together with us.
His Majesty... must we drag His Majesty into the water with us?
If we don't do that, our military power is too weak.
We need his help.
Even if I tell him, he won't believe me.
In that case, how about taking Gye Baek along?
Gye Baek?
Yes.
That is also one way of doing it.
Right, what about the other issues?
Have you located our comrades who studied with us before?
Yes, everybody wants to contribute.
All the positions have been occupied by the noblemen, therefore there are no positions available to them.
Everybody has endured this for a long time.
Even if this means they may have to become enemies with the noblemen, and even though it may be dangerous, they still want to participate.
In every village we've had very sympathetic responses from the village chief.
Everyone has raised a ruckus that they've been oppressed by the nobility for far too long.
If the guarantee is cancelled, coupled with unreasonable taxes and the military power, everyone will stand on our side.
If the students and the village chiefs were to side with us, this will increase our power greatly.
Yes, that's right.
Did you say you needed my help?
We want to cause a split between Prince Gyo Gi and the Queen.
Please help us.
Fine, of course we must do that.
Thank you, Sinyeo.
A person named Heung Su will bring Prince Gyo Gi here.
This is the place.
We welcome you, Prince Gyo Gi.
You're really that Sinyeo.
Why are you staying in such a place?
When I was young I paid you a visit, can you remember that?
Of course, Your Highness.
How could I have forgotten you, Your Highness?
The most dazzling star of Baekje.
Are you talking about me?
Please go in quickly.
Baekje's most dazzling star.
I like that, I like that.
There were two Empress Dowagers during the Han Emperor's reign.
The Empress Dowagers were the Emperor's mother and grandmother.
Only by relying on the two of them, could the Emperor govern the country.
Another example is Li Shi Min, who held power in the Tang court.
If he'd just followed his father's way of thinking, he would never have become the Emperor.
Your Highness, you must know that you're a more dazzling star than Lee Shi Min.
Am I?
A small tree must fall out from its parents embrace, only then can the tree grow large.
Once the tree has grown to be a big tree, isn't it time to complete the unification of the three kingdoms?
Is that the truth?
Do you know the reason why I was expelled from the Palace?
Your Highness's star is too bright.
You've now overshadowed the King and the Queen.
Since I've said this, I'll go further.
Both the King and the Queen, compared to others, were more afraid of you ascending the throne.
But, Heaven and Your Highness share the same path.
Don't be afraid of anything.
Concentrate and pursue the unification of the three countries.
History will forever remember Your Highness as the shining star.
Thank you, Sinyeo.
That advice was very profound.
This I promise.
When I ascend the throne,
I'll let you return to the Palace shrine.
I hope you have been well since we last met.
This time, Your Excellency Jang Son has performed a great deed.
You're referring to the destruction of Goguryeo's Gyeong Gwan?
That was indeed of great satisfaction to everyone.
Gyeong Gwan was meant to be Goguryeo's resistance to Su Dynasty attacks.
-= Goguryeo's cemetery where the remains of those who died in the war were buried =- Gyeong Gwan was meant to be Goguryeo's resistance to Su Dynasty attacks.
-= Goguryeo's cemetery where the remains of those who died in the war were buried =- That was built because they were looking forward to being victorious.
Why did the Tang destroy that?
Although one can say Gyeong Gwan is Su Dynasty's disgrace, the subjects of the Su Dynasty have now become the subjects of the Tang Dynasty.
Our Tang Dynasty in our efforts to unify the world, has agreed to bury the past.
How can we allow such a Gyeong Gwan to exist?
I, Jang Son, will absolutely not tolerate the existence of such a thing.
To see the reaction of the Goguryeo king when he saw the destruction of Gyeong Gwan,
I was delighted.
That doesn't seem like something worth showing off,
to talk about Tang unifying the world.
As far as I know the Tang Dynasty is still plagued by conflicts in remote Tubo (current Tibet) and the Turks.
If the Tang Dynasty were to unify the world, then there wouldn't be such worrisome matters.
Tubo and the Turks will eventually bow down to His Majesty the Emperor.
So in future, your war efforts will focus on the conflicts in Tubo and the Turks.
Your Excellency has provoked Goguryeo unnecessarily, and because of this matter has left a knife in Goguryeo's back.
Will this make your attacks on Tubo and the Turks any easier?
Goguryeo has already built a wall a thousand miles long, and is ready for war.
Therefore Your Excellency, you don't have to show off your destruction of Goguryeo's Gyeong Gwan.
In the face of imminent war, you've provoked another enemy.
That's extremely stupid behavior.
Such truism.
Your Excellency, if you want to show off such foolish matters in the future, you'll just turn out to be a laughing stock.
It's better for you to exert some self-discipline.
So, what does Your Excellency expect us to do?
You must stop the war.
Take this as a strong warning.
Baekje has captured Silla's Gajamseong City and taken its people captive,
Baekje has captured Silla's Gajamseong City and taken its people captive, so the Emperor has decreed that you return everything.
If you were to defy His Majesty's decree like you did previously,
I don't know what the Emperor will do to you.
You just provoked Goguryeo, do you want to become enemies with Baekje?
Your Majesty, no matter how they threaten us, you must absolutely not agree.
Listen carefully, Your Excellency.
Baekje cannot accept the Tang Dynasty's request.
If you should make a similar request in the future, we'll cut off all ties and communications with the Tang Dynasty.
As all the court officials are opposed to this, there's nothing I can do.
To allow His Excellency Jang Son to be humiliated, isn't His Excellency Jang Son a trusted aide of the Emperor?
You're right.
If relations between Baekje and the Tang Dynasty were to deteriorate, even if Your Highness were bestowed the Crown Prince title, it won't do any good.
No, it's better like this.
It's been said that in a crisis opportunities will appear.
Everyone in our court opposed the proposal by His Excellency Jang Son, but Your Highness must join forces with His Excellency Jang Son.
In politics, one must be slick and sly.
To exclude the Tang Dynasty, such a tough stance, should not be the first order of things.
If we go by the current momentum, this time Tubo and the Turks will definitely concede defeat.
If they were to become our patron, then Your Highness can be likened to sitting on a tiger's back.
For me to return Gajamseong City to them and release all the Silla captives?
Looking at the current situation, even if we wanted to return Gajamseong City, there's no way we can do so.
If that's the case...
Give them a guarantee that when you've ascended the throne you'll return Gajamseong City to them.
First, release all the Silla captives secretly.
That should be enough to show our sincerity.
After you've ascended the throne, we could just make use of any excuse to return Gajamseong City to them.
Regarding the release of the Silla captives, leave that to me.
Your Highness, you want to return Gajamseong City?
That's correct.
Although I don't have the power to do so now, after my ascension to the throne, I will abide by our agreement.
As an expression of my sincerity to abide by that agreement,
I will immediately release all the Silla captives.
This is my written pledge.
Is there anything else you want to say to me?
After your return to your homeland, speed up my conferment as Crown Prince.
The earlier I ascend the throne, the earlier both countries can derive any benefits from Tang and Baekje's relationship.
One more matter, if we were to attack Goguryeo, will you help us?
I, Gyo Gi, will not just ascend the throne,
I will unify the three countries.
If Tang were to attack Goguryeo,
I will lead my troops and attack the Southern part of Goguryeo.
Very well.
If Your Highness so pledges,
I will certainly put forward your proposal to His Majesty the Emperor.
Not just as the Crown Prince.
Your Highness will become the king of Baekje.
Thank you!
Your Majesty, Master Myeong Jin is seeking an audience.
Myeong Jin?
Tell him I don't want to see him, ask him to leave.
Didn't I tell you to leave?
Your Majesty.
I don't want to receive greetings from a fellow like you.
I didn't come because I wanted to greet you.
Although I've given up my family and become a monk, that doesn't mean my heart is similarly inclined.
What do you want to say?
Come in.
Aren't you the Queen's guard named Seungri?
Your servant's real name is not Seungri.
My name is Gye Baek.
Gye Baek...
The Queen's guard,
Your Majesty's subordinate, is the son of Mu Jin, Gye Baek.
Do you remember me?
I clearly heard you were dead.
Are you really that child Gye Baek?
This is my father's possession.
Yes, this is Mu Jin's sword.
Your resentment towards me must be very strong?
Yes, very strong.
I was able to survive until now because of my revengeful heart towards Prince Ui Ja.
But I know now, the root of the matter lies elsewhere.
Are you referring to Sa Taek Jeok Deok?
The root I'm referring to is comparatively deeper than that.
Compared to that, someone more powerful and rich, but the harsh reality is he or she is one who decimates the dispossessed.
Together with Prince Ui Ja, I want to eliminate that pain.
Your Majesty.
For the sake of Your Majesty's dream, likewise our longing for peace and prosperity, please join forces with us.
What?
I should form an alliance with Tang?
What are you saying?
Emperor Li Shi Min of Tang, in acting to stabilize the domestic situation, was more loved by his subjects, compared to previously.
He also invaded the borders of other countries, and that momentum will cause him to rise up.
At a time like this, if we were to reject them, in future it will not benefit Baekje either.
Although Your Highness's words are not completely unreasonable, it's not necessary to oblige their unreasonable demands and seek their indulgence.
Give a person an inch, they'll take a yard.
Do you think that Tang, in a situation which doesn't benefit them, help Silla?
Just wait and see.
There'll come a day when Silla's demands will overwhelm the Tang, and there'll be a big war.
Regardless, among all our neighbouring countries, the most powerful is the Tang Dynasty.
If we can give them some benefit, so that they won't side with Silla, they'll also give us due respect and return the favour to us.
You useless fellow, what nonsense are you spouting?
If we want to hold off Silla, compared to faraway Tang, it's better for us to align ourselves to nearby Goguryeo.
It's because of such behaviour from you that I cannot trust your judgment.
When you ascend the throne sometime in the future, what will become of this country?
You're so dismal!
Leave immediately!
You don't look well.
What happened to you?
Go and set free all the Silla captives immediately.
Right now?
Don't make me repeat myself.
Yes, I'll do as you bid.
Let's go.
Yes!
Things have finally begun.
Do you think everything will go smoothly?
I'm not confident.
What do you expect us to do when you are only telling us now that you're not confident?
I am saying I'm confident we will not fail.
Have you ever seen me wasting my time on something that I'm not confident in?
Having said so, will the source of that self-confidence trust in your mind as well?
Of course, now we're left with one more, that fellow.
That fellow who's like a wolf.
What's strange is he has a certain charm that draws people to him.
The people themselves don't know when it started, but compared to lively Prince Ui Ja, people trust him more.
It's because he's not greedy.
All he wants to see is that a person can live in dignity as a human being in this world.
Maybe the people are able to feel that intuitively?
I saw it was getting late and came out to accompany you home.
Because the Queen hadn't fallen asleep, it was difficult to leave.
I heard you succeeded, that's a real relief.
The Prince is also here, follow me quickly.
Gyo Gi has now acted according to our plan.
Now that the Queen knows of this matter, she will definitely not let things lie.
We must let the Queen know that this is Gyo Gi's plan.
Do you think that will be all right?
I'll say that because I was suspicious of Prince Gyo Gi, I told the soldiers to follow him.
Will she believe you?
If I say it with genuine faith I'm confident she will believe me.
If up to know, she has never suspected agassi's words, I think she'll believe.
(Agassi - young lady)
Be careful, the Queen is shrewder than anyone.
Yes, Your Highness.
Let me take you home.
I'll be fine, just accompany His Highness home.
His Highness has left with Cho Yeong and the other warriors, I think he'll be fine.
I'm fine with it also.
I intentionally came alone because I was worried someone might see me.
If someone should see us together it will bode ill.
I'm always in the same room with you, agassi, but yet have to pretend I don't know you.
I feel so stifled.
That's why I wanted to accompany you on your way, so that I can have a heart to heart talk with you.
This is the time where we must practice caution.
Truth be told, I've always felt happy and steadfast, although I'm making an effort to pretend not to know you, even though we're in the same room.
Who are you?
You have to go somewhere with me.
You boor!
Do you know who am I?
I'm the person who takes care of the Queen.
Why would a person who takes care of the Queen meet up with Prince Ui Ja?
Do you want to take my remaining eye as well?
Should I make you blind?
Go quickly!
Gye Baek.
Hurry up!
I will absolutely not allow you to pass.
Do you think I avoided you because I fear your sword?
If you desire death so much, I'll help you achieve it.
You have already done that a long time ago to a person who was very important to me.
If I let you off,
I'll probably lose the person who's life is more important than my own.
I will never let you off.
Who are you really?
You will never know.
Don't feel too lonely.
Your leader will follow right behind you.
I'll look again elsewhere.
Nothing will happen.
You're aware of Gye Baek's strength, aren't you?
That person's skill is not that of an ordinary person.
Don't worry.
Gye Baek is definitely not that kind of person.
He's not one who'll seek death and leave me, Cho Yeong, and you agassi.
Not me, I meant you, agassi.
Agassi... then can you, agassi, be the reason for me to continue living?
Are you all right?
Agassi...
Don't get hurt because of me, don't fall down because of me.
I didn't do it for your sake but for my own, so that I can live on.
It's because I don't want to lose the reason that enables me to live on.
Is Nam Jo not back yet?
That's right.
All right, continue looking for him.
Yes.
Something must have happened.
Did you say all the Silla captives have escaped?
Yes.
How did this happen, who is responsible for this?
I'm not sure whether I should tell you what I heard a few days ago.
Prince Gyo Gi met with the Tang envoy.
Gyo Gi?
Then are you saying this is Gyo Gi's work?
I am not sure about that, but it could be related.
Where did you hear this from?
Because of the diplomatic issue between Prince Gyo Gi and the Tang, differences seemed to arise between Your Majesty and him.
I was afraid something might happen, so I ordered someone to follow him.
Are you saying you expected this to happen?
Although that's not what I expected...
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
You are...
-= Next Episode Preview =-
We were almost exposed.
I order Ui Ja to return to secular life as Prince Ui Ja.
Do you want to drag Her Majesty down?
Once everything is completed, I think they will rebel.
You must be careful.
Don't let her live.
Who was the person who brought you here?
I am the mastermind.
When they die, let them all be buried as martyrs.
Wake up, Your Majesty!
Why did His Majesty suddenly collapse?
The person who to administer the country's affairs should be Prince Gyo Gi.
This battle will not end.
Whether it's Your Majesty or me, neither of us are good reasons.
Our days will be happy days from now on.
It has to be that way.
From now on, I won't let you go.
Sitting in this position,
I thought I could achieve everything.
But there's nothing I can do.
I'm making everyone tired.
They've endured so many painful years, just so that I alone can survive.
Even now, I can't have a good night's sleep.
Thinking about it, my heart aches.
You've had too much wine.
Don't drink anymore.
Your Highness, Your Highness.
Your Majesty.
My younger brother Gye Baek, please spare him.
My younger brother Gye Baek.
You've said before there will be a star who'll be able to save this country from the crisis it's in.
Please spread this divine news on the streets.
Gye Baek's deed is spreading like wildfire among the people.
If we were to add on the divine exhortations, the people will save Gye Baek.
If we do that, this will instead put that star in danger.
There are also a lot of people who don't like a star that shines too brilliantly.
Can agassi hide that star single-handedly?
(Agassi - young lady)
The star that you should be protecting is not that star, instead you should protect the star who is the shepherd of the Baekje sky.
Are you asking me to protect the sky?
Although Queen Sa Taek has abdicated, we are still unable to return to our shrine.
Now is still not the right time.
You will have to forebear and endure for a short while more.
But when the time comes, you must help me.
To enter the shrine requires His Majesty's permission.
I'm not even a member of the royal family, how can I help you?
You will be able to help me.
Heaven is in need of you.
Agassi, something has happened, it looks like Gye Baek has left.
What are you talking about?
This was conveyed by the guard to His Highness.
-= Resignation letter =-
Where do you think you're going?
Agassi.
If it wasn't because I was trailing him, he would certainly have left long ago.
You must make him stay.
I was about to go and see you, agassi.
What is this?
You're just going to leave like this, what will I do?
Everybody is doing their utmost on your behalf, but irresponsible you, just want to leave like this.
What will we do?
I've put everyone to so much trouble.
I'm doing this to lessen the people's pain.
Why is everybody suffering because of this one matter?
That's politics.
His Majesty, on the face of it seems to be doing this for your sake, but he doesn't wish for you to become Baekje's hero.
Because the more brilliant you shine, the lustre of the dragon seat, as it fades, the more ruthless it will become.
That's why I don't like this kind of political scene.
Even if it's not here, there'll be a place where I can contribute to the country and the people, by doing something.
Gye Baek, you're really a fool.
If you leave this place, you can no longer become powerful.
Without power you'll be unable to help and contribute to the country and the people.
My hope is that you'll become the hero of this country.
I want to spend my life living with such a hero.
Agassi, I don't want to become a hero.
I don't wish for you to grasp and not let go of this place.
In this place, no matter how clean and honest your work is, it will be contaminated.
Agassi, leave here with me.
Follow me, and together we'll find a place where we can contribute to this country.
You really know how to make a person speechless.
I'm going to remain here.
If you must really leave, don't ever expect to see me again.
Ga Ui eonni, Ga Ui eonni.
(Eonni - older sister)
After I sell off these today, I'll buy a lot of delicious food for all of you.
It's the General.
I'm going to remain here.
If you must really leave, don't ever expect to see me again.
Ga Ui?
You want to give these to me?
Wow, it's really delicious.
Thank you.
You must find it really hard work to have to look after all your younger siblings?
Do you want me to help you out in any way?
As long as General comes, I'm happy.
The other children are also very happy.
I really hope things can return to how they were before, the time when you were living with us, General.
Thank you, for saying that.
In fact, I too prefer this place to the outside world.
Being with all of you, I have nothing to worry about.
Agassi, Gye Baek is in Heukchae.
Really, you're obviously curious but are pretending that it doesn't matter.
Don't dilly dally, just get married to Gye Baek.
What?
Do you think I'm blind?
Any discerning person can see that you and Gye Baek have mutual affections for each other.
Just like a perfect couple, isn't that so?
I've been craving for wine recently.
Let me drink to my heart's content on your wedding day.
Go and get married quickly.
Don't let the person beside you be sad any longer.
Elder.
You are here.
This is the last batch of persimmons.
You said before that you'll pay me for the persimmons today, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
My younger siblings have requested that I buy a lot of delicious food for them.
Fine, just wait for me here.
Yes.
What is this?
Did you bring these persimmons?
What, can't you see that this is rotten?
The others are rotten as well?
It can't be, I checked them carefully.
What?
If you don't like those that I brought today,
I won't take the money for today's persimmons.
Please just pay me for those that I brought previously.
This small child, you're giving an adult things that aren't fit for eating.
Bringing rotten fruit and yet you dare to demand money for it!
I intended to let you off originally, but I can't.
No wonder our family business hasn't been doing well.
It's all because of you, rotten girl!
I've heard the news.
Are you still contemplating whether you're going to leave?
The world has become chaotic all because of me.
That's not what I wanted.
General!
General!
What is the matter?
Did you pick a fight with somebody?
Ga Ui nuna has been taken away by government officials.
(Nuna - older sister)
What?
Is there someone by the name of Ga Ui who was brought here?
We've detained a child in prison.
Who are you?
Please enter quickly, Deok Sol Sir.
Has the shop owner not turned up yet?
What are you doing?
What do you think you're doing?
We've brought him here.
You detestable villain!
You've been accepting the persimmons, but now when it's time to pay, you claim they were rotten.
You assumed she was an orphan, and a child and didn't have the power.
That she won't have an adult to speak up on her behalf, and you without justification punished her, and sent her to the government office here, isn't that so?
No, there were clearly rotten persimmons there that I...
Villain, you're still refusing to tell the truth!
Do you know who this is?
He's General Gye Baek.
On a previous occasion, didn't something similar happen?
I had my suspicions then.
This time, I'll make sure to carry out a thorough investigation and get to the bottom of this.
Please let me off.
Business has been really bad, I deserve to die, Deok Sol Sir.
-=Deok Sol: 4th rank out of a total of 16 ranks=- Please let me off.
Business has been really bad, I deserve to die, Deok Sol Sir.
-=Deok Sol: 4th rank out of a total of 16 ranks= =Deok Sol: 4th rank out of a total of 16 ranks=- Spare me!
Spare me!
Your offence is not light either, how is it that you didn't even investigate?
You just listened to that person's side of the story, and hauled a small child to prison.
Can you still call yourself an official who's working for the people?
My apologies.
If such a thing should happen again,
I definitely won't forgive you.
Yes.
Ga Ui.
General.
How long have you been crying?
Ga Ui, do you know what?
What?
Of all the people I know, you're the one who lives your life most earnestly.
One person caring for so many siblings,
I just have to look at you to see my strength increasing.
I'm not like you General, someone who performs great deeds.
No, you're wrong.
If the officials of this country were to care for the people just like you, those who go hungry, are despondent and those who are framed, will vanish from this world.
Just like our fortress?
Yes, but our Ga Ui is so light.
So light, what shall we do?
You must eat more so that you'll grow faster.
Then General, if I were to eat more and grow quickly, can you fulfill one of my wishes?
Fine, then.
As long as it's our Ga Ui's wish, I will fulfill it.
Really?
Definitely.
Ga Ui is back.
Ga Ui eonni!
Thank you.
It's all thanks to the General.
Let me ask you a question.
Yes, hyeongnim.
(Hyeongnim - respected older brother)
Did you meet with any difficulties when you were rescuing Ga Ui?
The owner confessed very easily.
Yes, it should be very easy, shouldn't it?
The general of a country, and national hero, went personally to the governmental office.
The officials must have been scared to death.
The shop owner must have begged for mercy at the first opportunity available.
But, if we should reverse the situation, with you being locked up in prison, and it was Ga Ui who went to rescue you.
Do you think it would have been just as easy for Ga Ui to rescue you?
If she didn't die in the process, she would have been lucky.
What is it that you're trying to say?
You were able to save Ga Ui today because you had the power.
It's not because of Gye Baek the man, but because of your status as General.
It's this city's hero who saved Ga Ui.
Just for a child, you had to borrow your position and power to save her.
Even though we're currently trying to undertake changes in our country, do you think without a little bit of status and power, you can change a country so easily?
If you were to just give up like this and leave, do you really think you can even do little things for the people?
Righteousness and justice.
It's only when you're able to guard them when it's necessary, that they can be of value.
You should consider this carefully before you make a decision whether to stay or leave.
That's why I don't like this kind of political scene.
Even if it's not here, there'll be a place where I can contribute to the country and the people, by doing something.
We have made all the preparations for dinner with the noblemen.
You've worked hard, uncle.
No, it's me who has been receiving your help all along.
I'm glad that I'm able to help you with this minor matter.
I really hope I can help you save General Gye Baek.
I'm sure this will be of great help.
But, Eun Go, there's a person who has extended great help to me in gathering all these noblemen together.
I hope you can find the time to see him for a moment.
The person whom you want me to meet is this person?
He asked me as a favour, to let him meet you once.
Come in quickly, Jang Sa.
Even though I know I'm being disrespecful,
-=Jang Sa: the highest official in charge of the civil service.= =Jang Sa: the highest official in charge of the civil service.=- there's something that I must say to you.
Former naesin jwapyeong Gim Il.
The only reason why you were not banished was because we didn't want to see great bloodshed in the royal court.
It was due to His Highness, the Crown Prince's generosity that you weren't punished.
There's not a single person who doesn't know the sins you've committed for the Sa Taek family.
I know, I'm well aware of it.
I, Gim Il, lived the life of a dog under the Sa Taek family.
I've committed many wrongs.
But no matter, I want to look for a new master and start my life all over again.
That's why I wanted to meet and have a discussion with you, Jang Sa.
Please give me an opportunity.
In the future, no matter what, I'll do whatever you want me to do.
Thank you to all of you for coming here today.
I've requested your presence here today because there's something I need your assistance with.
As all of you here must know by now, there'll be a meeting tomorrow.
I hope all of you will extend your assistance and acquit General Gye Baek of all charges and release him.
General Gye Baek will in future be one who'll perform great deeds for this country.
Isn't that person called Gye Baek, the one who beheaded our noblemen?
I don't know when my head will be cut off.
I'd better safeguard it myself.
Right, right.
Quiet please.
If we were to abide by your words, what benefits will we derive from it?
I'm sure all of you know that Jang Sa is the Crown Prince's supporter.
She'll convince the Crown Prince not to do anything to the noblemen.
That being said, can we trust her?
Yes.
Yes.
How can we believe you?
Yes, you will not believe my words, that's why there's a person who would like to meet all of you.
Come in.
Isn't this naesin jwapyeong?
It's been a while since we last met, everybody.
I repent all the wrongs that I committed when I was a lackey for the Sa Taek family.
Jang Sa gave me a new opportunity.
All of you must have heard of Wei Jing, Li Shimin's subordinate, haven't you?
He's actually Li Shimin's brother, Li Jianmin's subordinate.
He wanted to kill Li Shimin, but when Li Shimin was enthroned as the emperor, he didn't seek revenge on him, and instead he gave him a position.
Wei Jing is now helping the Emperor in nation building.
Should I be given another chance,
I would like to be like him.
If all of you were to trust Eun Go Jang Sa, you'll be given another chance, just like me.
We understand what you're trying to say.
Now, can you believe in me?
Jang Sa wants to pick out the daejwapyeong from one of you here.
Is that so?
Yes, that's right.
Now everybody can understand the painstaking efforts taken by Jang Sa.
Everything has proceeded so smoothly, it's such a relief.
Uncle.
What's wrong?
What do you intend to do with naesin jwapyeong?
He was the one who approached me first.
Have you accepted anything from him?
It's not what you think.
I made it a point to avoid him, but, the matter this time, I thought he could be of assistance.
That's why I introduced him to you.
Is that the truth?
This is really sad, don't you believe me?
All right, uncle.
Today's matter was all thanks to him for handling it well.
But... although there's no way to avoid any contact with him this time, you must be careful in the future.
I understand.
I will do as you say.
Commander Gye Baek did not commit any wrongs.
Is this your conclusion?
Yes, Your Majesty.
All the ministers present at the meeting deliberated on each and every merit and demerit of Gye Baek's actions, and felt that the achievements outweighed the defaults.
and felt that the achievements outweighed the defaults.
This is a reflection of the people's opinion of Commander Gye Baek.
Didn't you say that defying the imperial edict is a more serious crime?
According to Zhong's theory, if we compare his action to that of a rebellion, this is very mild.
This is acting with discretion.
-=Acting on one's own discretion: the right to decide or act according to one's own judgment.=- This is acting with discretion.
-=Acting on one's own discretion: the right to decide or act according to one's own judgment.=-
To make a decision by oneself to lay siege to the city is not a crime?
We went and investigated and discovered the living conditions of the common people.
The constant invasions had made their lives very difficult.
They said the same as Commander Gye Baek.
The Commander that Your Majesty sent had dealt with the corrupt officials.
This can be interpreted as having safeguarded the royal family's dignity.
Is that so?
Gye Baek safeguarded the royal family's dignity?
Are you two still worried about the noblemen?
Why did the noblemen have a sudden change of heart?
Are you thinking about it?
Of course, it's occurred to me.
It's so strange that everything is proceeding so smoothly.
The noblemen must have been offered something in return for their change of heart.
If it's not something they desire, they wouldn't have changed their minds.
It doesn't matter what it is they want, it has nothing to do with us, does it?
This brat is so complacent.
In the eyes of an upright person, is bean sauce and faeces the same?
Yes, unfortunately the world is just like his mouth, just as dirty.
If the world is like my mouth, then everything is fine.
Gye Baek, did it ever occur to you,
His Majesty is forewarning you.
His Majesty could handle your case by himself, but instead he turned your case over to the noblemen.
To send you away just like that would be unacceptable.
I'm worried whether he's pressuring you.
That can't be.
He's feeling sympathetic towards my father, who sacrificed his life for the Crown Prince and the late Queen.
How can such a person be forewarning me?
It's you, hyeongnim, who's reading too much into this.
Although you might find this difficult to accept, it may be because of General Mu Jin that he's giving you a warning.
It's not just this matter.
Previously, Baekje was never in the hands of His Majesty, it was in the hands of the Sa Taek family.
Compared to His Majesty, Queen Sa Taek was more popular and had greater presence.
But now you're Baekje's hero.
You're the recipient of the people's love and praise.
It's possible that you've now impeded His Majesty from introducing new legislation.
Gye Baek.
Jealousy can make a person insane.
To be honest, the praise that's been heaped on you by the people made me jealous too.
The Crown Prince will also have a change of heart towards you.
Hyeongnim.
That's a futile thought.
His Majesty and the Crown Prince are the country's most revered people.
How can he be issuing me a warning?
Is it really impossible to change the outcome?
Aren't they the ones who wanted to punish Gye Baek?
Now they're saying he's innocent.
Now they make it seem like I'm the one who wanted to punish Gye Baek.
People must find my image so ridiculous now.
I apologize for making you angry.
It's the decision of the nobility, I too...
I...
I'm suspicious whether someone has swayed them.
Is it the Crown Prince who met up with them?
The decision was made by them personally.
They weren't influenced.
I'm asking you again, is Gye Baek really innocent?
Yes, Your Majesty.
I've left nothing out, Your Majesty.
I know, leave now.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Is anyone outside?
Your Majesty, are you calling me?
Tell the Crown Prince to come over.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Were you behind this?
What?
Saving Gye Baek.
I'm asking you again whether it was you who convinced the noblemen.
I'm sorry that I didn't discuss it with you beforehand.
It really was you.
You've worked hard.
Thanks to you, Gye Baek is saved.
But...
If they have abided by your words, they must surely have received something in return.
What did they request?
I didn't do anything that crossed the line.
I just acceded to a few of their demands.
The noblemen wanted one of their people to be the daejwapyeong.
Who do they have in mind?
Crown Princess, you're here.
His Highness is not in today too?
No, he's in.
He's inside.
Then just inform him.
But, he has a guest with him now.
Guest?
Who is it?
Will that be difficult?
I know the nephew of the Sa Taek family.
Though he's from the Sa Taek family, he's different from the Sa Taek Queen.
He's not a selfish person and is a man of letters.
That's right.
We don't have to doubt his character.
Even if the noblemen didn't make this request, going by his character and conduct, he'll do a good job.
But...
I can't tell you now whether His Majesty will consent.
The daejwapyeong, is the leader of the noblemen and is someone who can unite them.
Will he allow such a position to be passed on to a member of the Sa Taek family.
Even if he becomes the daejwapyeong, he will curtail the powers of the daejwapyeong so that he cannot be a threat to the throne.
if we do it like this, His Majesty will change his mind.
There are other, more important things.
The royal court in the future will not be led by His Majesty but by you, Crown Prince.
Are these all the conditions necessary to save Gye Baek, and now all that's left is for me to accept them?
But...
What if
I reject your proposal, what will you do then?
Even if it's not their request,
I want to take this opportunity to be fair to the nobility.
Even if I could forget my hatred towards the Sa Taek family, to recruit a member of the Sa Taek family is not something I had in mind.
Are you going to continue using members of the Sa Taek family?
Your Highness.
Have you forgotten how my father and brother died?
We're discussing official matters.
It's not something you should interfere in.
Your Highness, don't you care even slightly for my feelings?
How can I sit together with a person who killed my father?
Your Highness, Crown Princess.
Refusing to appoint him just because he's a member of the Sa Taek family, gives the impression that we're not just and transparent.
Is this your idea?
Are you the one who convinced His Majesty to allow the Sa Taek family to continue working in the royal court?
You've gone overboard with your words, wife.
Whose side is Your Highness on?
Your Highness, His Majesty is looking for you.
Your Highness, I'm sorry that I made you angry.
Don't apolgize if you're not sincere.
If you let the Sa Taek family return, I'll never forgive you.
You must be out of your mind now.
You're thinking of appointing a member of the Sa Taek family to be the daejwapyeong?
You want to reinstate the Sa Taek family by appointing their cohort?
Yes, I want to do that.
The royal court has now been thrown into chaos.
Only by doing this can we fight against those experienced people.
This should be of great help to us.
If we do this, the noblemen will welcome this decision with open arms.
The reason for the outcome of Gye Baek's matter is also because of this.
That has nothing to do with this.
This is just my opinion.
In that case, the noblemen who are worried about their downfall, will be grateful to Your Majesty and will remain loyal to you.
Are all these your own views too?
That's right.
You were nine years old then, when the Sa Taek family tried to kill you for the first time.
At that time my life was also threatened many times.
Compared to me, you probably hate the Sa Taek family more, but a person like you still wants to make use of members of that family?
Tell me honestly.
Whose idea is this?
It's my idea.
Why are you here?
His Majesty said he wants to see him.
Your Majesty, the Crown Princess is here.
Send her in.
The more I look, the more he resembles the Crown Prince when he was young.
Why are you crying?
It's good that he resembles the Crown Prince, but I'm worried that his life will be like the Crown Prince's.
What are you trying to say?
Tell me quickly.
His Highness' relationship with Jang Sa is not an ordinary relationship.
Are you referring to Eun Go?
Yes.
There's no love between His Highness and me.
If two such people were to have a child, such a child will be hated.
You have misunderstood.
Ui Ja has no feelings for Eun Go.
I've seen His Highness with that woman many times.
I can also hear very clearly.
The Crown Prince likes Eun Go.
Your Highness, did you ask for me?
Have a seat.
What's the matter?
I think something must have happened to Eun Go.
What could have happened?
The noblemen must have made approaches to people who are close to Eun Go.
Are you talking about Agassi?
They are many people who still support the Sa Taek family here.
They have probably planned well, and Eun Go still doesn't comprehend them well.
If Eun Go doesn't agree to their demands,
I don't know how they will retaliate.
What if His Majesty gets to know of this?
Whether it's her family or Eun Go herself, they won't be able to escape.
Then what shall we do?
Whatever might make His Highness suspicious, I've forestalled it.
You, should go and monitor the people from Eun Go's side.
To monitor those who are close to agassi, we shouldn't do this.
And you're asking me to do it.
I can't do it.
How is it that you don't know this is a preventive measure that we have to take?
This is concerning Eun Go.
Apart from you who else is able to do it.
If you discover any of her contacts, you must take care of it before His Majesty finds out, but you can't let Eun Go know.
I will ask Seong Chung and Heung Su for their assistance.
You must destroy the evidence before His Majesty learns of it.
Can you do it?
I'll try my best.
A member of the Sa Taek family!
I can't accept this.
How can we start having dealings with the Sa Taek family again?
The outcome was because of this.
If I knew of this,
I'd be scared too.
What exactly is Jang Sa thinking?
Trying to make use of a member of the Sa Taek family?
So this is her scheme?
But wasn't she able to save Gye Baek.
Furthermore, if we hadn't made use of the noblemen, we wouldn't have achieved our goals.
What Eun Go said is correct.
The Sa Taek family is still of use.
I can see the advantages and the disadvantages clearly.
But not the Sa Taek family.
We have just managed to curtail the powers of the nobility.
If we were to let them come together again, it will be very dangerous.
Don't get worked up.
Only then can we discuss with His Majesty calmly, what we've discussed here.
To discuss this matter?
For the good of the commoners, there needs to be a change to the legal system.
Is that important now?
We're facing a fire now.
Even if a member of the Sa Taek family were to become the daejwapyeong, and the nobility were to be reinstated here, with our resistance, they can't grow more powerful.
That's not it!
Where did you hear that?
Continue with what you were saying.
The private armies of the aristocracy are dependent on the commoners.
The other issue that will satisfy the commoners is the one pertaining to land.
Therefore, the conclusion is land matters.
If that's the case, how should we handle this land matter?
A system.
Are you talking about a land system?
Yes.
From the Han Dynasty, Eunsang Dynasty and the Ju Dynasty, this practice has been handed down over three dynasties.
If we do it accordingly, the system can divide a piece of land into nine partitions.
Eight pieces of land for eight families to cultivate.
The other piece for a system of joint cultivation.
Is this so that we can first allow the commoners to produce their own food?
The problem is that in Baekje's present situation, this isn't viable at all.
The system of tenancy has been ingrained over many generations.
-=Land tenancy:
A system whereby a person rents land for cultivation from a landlord=- The system of tenancy has been ingrained over many generations.
-=Land tenancy:
A system whereby a person rents land for cultivation from a landlord=- Not just this piece of land, but the other eight pieces that belonged to the people,
-=Land tenancy:
A system whereby a person rents land for cultivation from a landlord= =Land tenancy:

are owned by the aristocracy.
How do you intend to solve this problem?
Prohibit the system of land tenancy in the metropolitan area.
Immediately implement the law that allows the aristocracy to collect land rental for one piece of land only.
It's easy to talk, but will the noblemen accept such changes in the law quietly.
That's why we have to make a proposal.
Let the position of daejwapyeong go to the Sa Taek family.
Allow those noblemen who were followers of the Sa Taek family be be reinstated with conditions, and in return, they will accept our proposal.
Therefore the end result is that we still have to accede to the aristocracy!
If everything is as you've said, it's better to go with what Seong Chung said.
Your Highness!
Welcome, Jang Sa.
Agassi, isn't he the running dog for the Sa Taek family?
Don't act rashly.
Agassi...
I'm very sorry, she doesn't think of the consequences.
That was rude of us.
I'm fine.
Please come in.
You wait for us here.
Agassi, although I don't know the reason, you shouldn't get close to such a person.
It's thanks to you the noblemen were convinced, and we eventually got the outcome that we wanted.
I've come here to express my gratitude, although I did anticipate this.
But for naesin jwapyeong to have the power to influence the noblemen, it's somewhat unexpected.
What's that you're saying?
It's all been done to please the new Jang Sa, the highest official of the royal court.
What Jang Sa?
Although I shouldn't say such words, the noblemen are very sensitive to the shifting of power.
Even if there's a slight whiff of trouble, their ears will stick out and their eyes will follow.
Isn't it like a tornado?
Previously, the centre of the tornado always involved the Crown Prince.
That person's most trusted confidante, the person who is most likely to make the Crown Prince waver, is here.
You Jang Sa.
It's something that's known even if one's eyes are closed.
What nonsense are you spouting.
-=Ni Lin: crescent shaped white scales on a dragon's neck, when touched it will unleash a dragon's violence.=- Are your words to be taken that the Crown Prince is His Majesty's "Ni Lin"?
-=Ni Lin: crescent shaped white scales on a dragon's neck, when touched it will unleash a dragon's violence.=-
Pardon me, I'm only trying to say that the person who creates the world is great.
Don't ever say that again.
If you say it once more,
I'll terminate the agreement that I made.
Really... it feels like seeing Queen Sa Taek all over again.
Such suffering, what is this?
Are you looking for us, hyeongnim?
I'm really going insane.
It wasn't easy to meet Yeol Bae in my dream,
After meeting me, she said she wants to come here.
Who woke me up?
What is it?
Why are you poking me?
What?
What's the matter?
There's an urgent matter that needs to be investigated immediately.
Investigate?
That's great, we're experts in conducting investigations.
We're unable to investigate on a normal front, but we can conduct one on the sly.
As for that, we're extremely good.
These children are very good in trailing.
Hey, isn't investigation our expertise?
That's correct.
From young, apart from eating, we'd be conducting an investigation.
You must do it immediately.
Please tell us, hyeongnim.
Who do you want us to investigate?
Go gently, go gently.
Rascal, didn't I tell you to do it gently?
Didn't I say don't step on the third and the fifth?
If you fall on me, you'll hurt me, rascal.
Keep quiet.
If we were to be discovered, we'll be punished.
It's all because you two kept stepping on my third and fifth, and causing me pain.
Gently.
Yes.
Gently, gently.
There, that's it!
The pain is killing me, the pain is killing me.
Those rascals, the third and the fifth.
Have they gone over?
This is really insane, it hurts, it really hurts.
Did you recover all this from Mok Han's house?
Yes, but what could he be doing with all this?
So much money.
With all this, it's clearly very obvious.
It's bribes or improperly acquired assets.
I'm not too knowledgeable, but all this can only spell the word corruption, am I right?
Wow, this is really a lot.
You two, guard this well.
Yes.
Hey, have you seen Dok Gae?
Come to think of it, he said he'd wait for us, but when we came out, he was nowhere to be seen.
He's run away, run away.
That's just great!
My heart is so at ease now.
Great, what's so great?
What heart at ease?
You rascals!
Aigoo, my lower back!
Aigoo, I'm going to die!
Didn't I tell you previously that I have a bad back, and told you to be gentle?
It's going to break any minute now, rascals!
Aigoo, my back!
Aigoo.
Aigoo, aigoo, I'm going to die!
Aigoo, my back.
Don't touch that.
It's because of this that my back is aching, rascal.
The pain will lessen if I were to take a look.
How should we handle this?
This is more serious than I expected.
If this is not handled properly Eun Go will come to great harm.
The problem now is whether Eun Go is aware of this.
If Agassi knew this, how could she do it?
She's definitely been framed.
You must catch the person who set the trap quickly.
Go and inform Eun Go about this.
Yes.
Are you looking for me, Your Highness?
You must wade in muddy water for a while.
Please let me have your orders.
Take this book-keeping record that came from the noblemen,
-=Book-keeping record: a record of transactions of money and goods.=- Take this book-keeping record that came from the noblemen, and my comrades who were in the rebellion with me.
It's difficult for me to do it openly.
I know what you mean.
Furthermore, I will be unafraid of death.
Arrest all those people in there.
Yes.
What is this?
Let go of me!
What are you doing?
Let go of me!
General, why are you acting like this?
Take him away.
Yes.
General!
General!
General!
What did you say just now?
I, myself, am not very clear as to what has happened.
Furthermore, the person who took Uncle away, is Gye Baek.
Bullseye!
It's Your Majesty's turn.
Fine.
I'm getting old.
How can Your Majesty say such a thing.
Your Majesty is healthier than everyone else.
Forget it, it's not necessary to comfort me.
Can I win over time?
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
What's the matter?
They are now many edicts requesting that Eun Go Jang Sa be punished.
You meeting the former naesin jwapyeong in secret, I saw with my own eyes.
Tell me the truth concerning the whole matter.
Eun Go agassi might come to harm because of this matter.
Doesn Eun Go agassi know of these bribes?
She doesn't know.
Is it really true that she doesn't know of this?
Eun Go is not that kind of a person, you should know that too, General, shouldn't you?
But, for you to accept those bribes secretly from the noblemen, what did you promise them?
That...
Without a word to me, how can you do this?
Agassi!
After I've established the true facts in the relationship,
I will let you know.
What do you mean by after establishing the true facts in the relationship?
Whether I'm involved in the corruption.
Are you referring to that kind of relationship?
I was the one who accepted it, it's not Uncle but me, Eun Go.
Don't say that.
I know you're not connected to the bribery matter.
All of us just want to protect you.
I saw you meeting up with Gim Il that night.
Why must you go and meet with a dangerous person like him?
There's a difference when a knife is held in the hands of a thief or in the hands of a General.
Did you think I liked going to meet Gim Il?
I met him because he still has some value that I can make use of.
Don't you know what kind of person he is?
He's the lackey for the Sa Taek family.
His Highness, the two hyeongnims and me as well, aren't willing to get entangled with him.
But how do you intend to make use of him?
I feel that you've become very scary.
Did you say I've changed?
That's what my eyes tell me.
Agassi, agassi!
Agassi!
Agassi!
Deok Sol Sir, you don't have to give chase anymore.
The saddest person now is agassi.
It's all because she wanted to save you, Deok Sol Sir.
What are you saying?
The outcome of the punishment committee meeting.
Did you think it was a coincidence?
It's all because agassi met Gim Il, who persuaded the other noblemen, that you, Deok Sol Sir, are able to maintain your status.
I want to be alone.
Don't let anyone in.
Agassi.
Who are you?
Eun Go Jang Sa, there's an order for your arrest.
All you villains, don't you dare touch even one hair on her head.
Don't act so recklessly.
Arrest her immediately!
Yes!

You!
Stand still, or die.
He's the type of person you're looking for.
He is willing to die for you.
How can you hide such a criminal?
Where is he now?
Hurry up and let's go.
There are a lot of people waiting for you.
The peasants directly captured him and handed him over to the officials.
Have you called for me?
You said you wanted to become my person.
Do you still want it?
Yes, of course.
Fine.
I am giving you your first job.
There is a person you have to kill.
Please, give the order.
Who do you want killed?
Episode 15
The person being held in the prison, do you mean that person?
That is so.
You cannot fail.
If you fail and are captured, you must kill yourself on the spot.
If you succeed, I'll take you in as my personal guard.
I accept your order.
Do you think you can do it?
It is heavily guarded and they are more alert than usual, given the situation.
I should give it a try.
Is there any way for me to help you?
Not helping me is a way to help.
We have to pretend not to know each other.
Even talking to me now is a mistake.
I know, but I am worried too.
This is just the beginning.
There will be more obstacles to overcome in the future.
If you are worried over this little thing, you'll make my work even more difficult.
Trust me.
I understand.
When Sing Hee kills that man, all the guards will head in that direction.
You have to take advantage of the situation and get the ledger.
Bring it back to me.
If Sing Hee gets stuck there, shouldn't we try to save him?
All you have to do is find and get the ledger, nothing else matters.
He is nothing but a decoy, meant to distract the guards' attention.
Whether he saves himself from that spot or not is not important.
I understand.
Is everything alright?
Yes.
Without my permission, nobody is allowed to enter this place.
- Be very careful!
- Yes!
Sing Hee did not try to break into prison, he observed and then retreated.
I think he was not confident enough to fulfill the task.
Otherwise we could have killed Geom Cheon and found the ledger.
Was I wrong about him?
He didn't look like a coward.
Sing Hee, Your Majesty's bodyguard, is asking for an audience.
Tell him to enter.
Why did you come?
Geom Cheon is not in that prison.
He is not there?
What do you mean by that?
Is it not fear that drove you back?
Why would I be afraid?
Security is too lax.
It doesn't look like a place already holding prisoners, rather a place expecting prisoners.
Were I to break in, I would have walked right into their trap.
Then where is he?
That, I do not know.
But if I were in their place, I would keep him safe somewhere outside the city walls.
They will have to move him at a certain moment.
All we have to do is wait.
It seems you are not an impulsive person, and you have great observation skills.
Leave me.
Yes.
He still refuses to give us the list of names.
How powerful are the ones on that list, to frighten him to such extent?
In fact, I have a suspect.
Who is it?
3 years ago, when Geom Cheon was exiled, Naesin Jwapyeong helped him get reinstated.
Isn't Naesin Jwapyeong the subordinate of the Prime Minster?
Is the Prime Minister involved, too?
It is what I think too.
But, until the investigation is finalized, we should refrain from speculating.
It seems Your Majesty would have to give up the death sentence, in his case.
Where is he now?
In a cave, outside the city.
What about the ledger?
Well... the ledger is hidden in a nearby temple.
Bring him here.
I want to interrogate him myself.
If he tells the truth, he will live.
Right.
Your Majesty should tell him clearly this.
Small fish are not important.
We have to capture the leader.
For sure it will be done that way.
I'll give you the newly appointed guards.
Guard him with your own life.
Yes, Your Highness.
Now, which of the three is Geom Cheon?
Assassins!
Catch him!
Go.
Catch him!
Archers!
Shoot!
Catch him!
You did a good job.
But how did you know the one in the middle was Geom Cheon?
How could you tell the difference?
I wanted to kill all three prisoners.
Yes, but in that case, it would have lasted too long and the surprise element would have been gone.
Anyway, not a bad fellow...
Leave me.
Yes.
So, Geom Cheon died and you lost the ledger, didn't you?
I am sorry.
We planned everything so carefully, and now everything is gone.
We two were the only persons who knew Geom Cheon was in the middle.
Your Majesty, I didn't talk to anyone about this matter.
I am not afraid of death and I swear on my honor!
Then, we have no means to unroot corruption?
What is certain is that the Prime Minister was involved in Geom Cheon's being reinstated.
A full investigation will bring this to light, Your Majesty.
You are alright, aren't you?
Yes.
I was worried about you.
You did a good job.
But how did you know Geom Cheon was the one in the middle?
It was pure luck.
I know you did not rely on luck alone.
Just tell me, don't be so humble.
In fact, I was quite confused, when I saw them.
But, after carefully observing them, I noticed some subtle differences between them.
Subtle differences?
It was the way they walked.
Both the man in front and the one at the back walked at a steady, normal pace.
Their walk looked comfortable.
But the second prisoner did not walk comfortably.
He was not sure where he was being dragged off to.
The uncertainty was due to not knowing what was going to happen to him.
It wasn't definite proof but I bet everything on that deduction.
I've gotten myself a very capable personal guard.
Is there any particular reward that you would like?
Yes.
What is it?
Please give me the opportunity to serve you to the end.
Whose end are you referring to?
Of course, my end.
Your ingenious loyalty is my favorite, despite your stunning skills in martial arts.
Itsn't that right?
It is Your Majesty's good fortune.
From now on you will protect me.
It's an honor, Your Majesty.
There was an opportunity to save him.
There was no need to kill him.
What are you saying now?
!
You can live because he has died.
And even I don't know who killed him.
There should be no secrets between you and me, Prime Minister.
You.
Anyway it is done so it is a relief.
It is not done yet.
Your Majesty, I am sorry I caused so much trouble.
Sorry?
Geom Cheon is dead, but we are still in trouble, because of your involvment in his being reinstated.
Besides, they will find out you received bribes.
Please, don't worry.
Whatever happens to me in prison, I shall not break.
I won't say anything.
How is that?
Considering you corrupted the officials...
With this incident, the peasants won't believe the royalty.
I really have no excuse.
Shall I just withdraw to a far off place for a length of time?
I will follow whatever order you give.
Do you think that by doing so people will forget their grievance?
Just kill yourself.
Your Highness.
Geom Cheon, our witness in this corruption case, was killed.
The ledger dissapeared too.
Those who did this are Geom Cheon's accomplices.
They must be here today.
If you confess now, your lives will be spared.
But if you are found guilty later on, your families will pay too for your crimes.
Naesin Jwapyeong, is it you?
Your majesty, it's not that.
Though I do not know who killed Geom Cheon, the person responsible for this corruption matter is
Dae Jeong Pu.
Naesin Jwapyeong, how dare you?
!
Such nonsense!
Really, Dae Jwapyeong?
They all bribed you, including the officials working with Geom Cheon.
I guess the Foreign Affairs Minister was not the only one who bribed you, the other 6 ministers did it too.
Naesin Jwapyeong!
Are you out of your mind?
Do you have any evidence?
Do you think someone like the Prime Minister would leave behind any evidence?
But I am well aware of all the rumors.
Those investigating this matter were quite clear about it, were they not?
Majesty, your servant is innocent!
I never took any bribe.
This is a set up.
Is that so?
If you have been wrongly accused, Naesin Jwapyeong will be punished.
But, in order to find out the truth, we have to start an investigation.
Your Highness.
Naesin Jwapyeong!
Naesin Jwapyeong!
Why did you accuse the Prime Minister?
Why did you do it?
Don't you know the Prime Minister is the leader of the nobles?
If you betray him, you betray all of us.
Don't you think you will pay a heavy price for betraying us all?
Do you think I did it with no reason?
You all know very well how loyal I am to the Sa Taek family!
But to me, he said to kill myself.
I was willing to take the blame for him and go into exile.
And now... is this the price I have to pay for being loyal to them?
If you don't want to end up like me, you should come to your senses.
Please tell us.
Is it true that those officials offered money as bribe?
Don't just sit there, say something.
Have we misjudged you?
And did you tell Naesin Jwapyong to kill himself?
Don't you trust me any more?
I've never taken any bribe.
You've followed me for so long.
Do you really not believe the queen and me?
I understand.
You are so firm on your position...
I shall never believe what others say.
I will believe in you.
You two, should not suspect him any more.
You should believe and support him.
What a surprise!
He turned around an bit the hand of the Prime Minister!
Due to the corruption case, the Sa Taek family pushed Gim Il on the edge of the cliff.
A dog doesn't bite its owner without a good reason.
Do you think the Queen and Jeok Deok are going to kill Gim Il?
Gim Il must know their intentions.
He will take all necessary precautions.
The problem is getting more interesting.
The nobles will be finally divided, not sharing the same opinion any more.
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Are you okay?
What shame...
what shame our family has to endure...
That Gim Il...
Gim Il... what a disgrace...
!
Sing Hee, are you outside?
You called for me, Your Highness?
You need to do something.
Please, give your order.
There is a conflict among the nobles.
God is helping us.
Go and give a warning to Gim Il, as the Queen ordered.
The queen is currently mistaken.
If Gim Il is injured, things will be even more difficult for the Sa Taek family.
I understand.
You can't get hurt.
Do you mean until the good day arrives?
What?
Who are you?
In His Excellency's room!
This...
This is Sa Taek family's doing.
I cannot trust them any more.
I feel the same way.
I heard an assassin broke into Gim Il's home last night.
I heard that, too.
Nevertheless, I don't think you are involved in this incident, Prime Minister.
It doesn't matter what people think, it is all due to my inefficiency.
I will withdraw.
The investigation hasn't begun yet.
Don't you react too soon?
Even if there is an investigation, for the sake of transparency and fairness, I have to resign.
There's nothing I can do if that's your attitude.
I was the cause of so much trouble for the royal family.
I am really very sorry.
Prince.
I just heard
Dae Ja Pyong has withdrawn.
Is that true?
It is.
Maybe it is because he tried to assassinate Naesin Jwapyeong.
The king may call for you.
He won't leave the Dae Jwapyong position empty during this turmoil.
Then it would be your duty to conduct the investigation.
You have to prepare thoroughly.
Father, I'm scared and nervous.
I wish you wouldn't get involved in this turmoil.
Madame, how can you say that?
This could be a good opportunity for father and myself.
Even so, you have to be careful.
Yes, I know.
I'll think about it carefully, so don't worry.
I heard you accepted the Prime Minister's resignation.
I only accepted Dae Jwapyong's intentions.
If he is innocent, what is the problem?
He will be reinstated as soon as he is proven not guilty.
Of course that is how it is.
But the investigation process must be correct.
If only one person conducts the investigation, it would be very difficult for that person.
I want to appoint Yeon Mun Jin as Prime Minister.
He will conduct the investigation.
He is a highlty respected and honest person.
His decision will be accepted by everyone.
Isn't that so, My Queen?
I'll take this opportunity to clean the Court, the nobles and all of the officials.
I don't think the Prime Minister is guilty, but if he is, he should be prepared to die.
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Mother.
Queen.
How is the queen?
I am sorry Your Highness.
I don't know yet.
Right now, I'm thinking that it may be due to a big emotional shock.
Mother...
What exactly is wrong?
Please, come to your senses, mother.
Mother.
It doesn't seem to be a serious illness but the queen collapsing like that can cause a big problem.
It is really bad.
For the royal family it is a disaster.
What do you think about this situation?
I want to reinstate you as Prime Minister.
I retired a long time ago...
I don't know if I can be of benefit.
I want you to conduct a thorough investigation of the Sa Taek family.
Until things are cleared up.
Well, let me see.
It is a very important matter.
I don't know if I should take on this job.
It is the perfect opportunity to bring down the Sa Taek family.
It's turning out well.
The Sa Taek family received a devastating blow.
We can finally get rid of the Sa Taek family.
Of course, it is possible.
But, is there something else you would like to do, besides bringing down the Sa Taek family?
Are you thinking of bringing down the queen, too?
Yes.
The king will join us in this effort.
Who knows when another opportunity will arise?
I know it is a good opportunity, but aren't you rushing things a bit?
Prince,
I've come this far dreaming of this opportunity.
I was waiting for this day, when I told my family to trust me, to follow me, as I brought into my home a dragon as my son-in-law.
This is what I was waiting for.
It is the perfect opportunity to destroy Sa Taek family.
This is when we can start afresh.
You have to make a decision, Your Highness.
Yeon Mun Jin Dae Jwapyeong wants to take this opportunity and bring down the Sa Taek family.
He also intends to bring down the Queen.
More over, he wants to convince His Majesty to change the system and get rid of Sa Taek and all the nobles who follow him.
Any other thoughts?
Ah really!
In the end this old man shows his true colours.
It seems like a good opportunity.
I agree with you.
A fleeting moment in a thousand years.
(the opportunity of a life time).
It is our occasion to bring down Sa Taek, the leader of the noble families.
We won't get this chance again will we?
This seems to be the situation.
What makes you say this?
What can I say?
It is an intuition I have now.
Intuition?
Which is also known as sixth sense, or feeling.
That's really what I think as well.
It may sound ridiculous, but I've been doing things according to my intuition for a long time.
Your Highness has endured this for far too long.
Since you've waited for so long, it may be that when the time comes to act, you're now reluctant to do so.
What do you think?
You have to let the Prince know what you think, only then can he make up his mind.
It's not easy to make a decision.
What I'm saying is that you, agassi, will have to expose your true self before the Queen.
I'm ready for that.
I am uneasy.
I'm afraid I may fail to protect you.
It's not just for revenge that I'm standing here.
It's because I want to protect the person I love, and... for that fine day in the future.
That's why I'm standing here.
Until I make sure I can protect you... agassi, I can't make my decision.
Just give me a little bit more time.
It looks just like a painting.
What's this about a good country or a bad country?
It would be good if a beautiful woman were to appear before my eyes now.
You've not looked at yourself in a mirror.
With your kind of looks, even if a woman should appear, she would take flight.
Have you finished talking?
No.
If you dream about women, ask Yeon Mun Jin to bring you a woman slave.
The way you behave, no woman would ever come looking for you.
If I were to get married, the first thing to be done would be throwing away my pride.
This is out of the question!
Look here, Seong Chung!
Do you really believe that once the Sa Taek family is out of the picture, things will settle down?
Once the tiger is removed, the wolf becomes the next king.
In fact, we just replace the Sa Taek family with Yeon Mun Jin's family.
This is what we do...
You think the same too yes?
Such an action needs extensive and careful preparation.
First, he has to be acknowledged by those nobles who did not support Sa Taek.
Then, he needs His Majesty's support.
If things go wrong, he will be the first to go down, so we must be prepared.
Yeon Mun Jin... that snake lying hidden in the grass...
that old man.
He already concluded a deal with His Majesty, or he wouldn't have come out so easily.
Even if we succeed, there will be many other matters to be settled.
I need to ponder over this matter with utmost caution.
I am here to see Her Majesty.
Her Majesty is not feeling wel.
That is exactly why I am here.
You!
I didn't say you could enter her chambers.
Let him come in.
I know him.
Make way.
I don't know when mother willcome to her senses.
From now on you will obey me as you obeyed my mother.
From this moment on
I am your master.
Once a master, always a master.
The sunflower that follows the sun does not bow its head only because the sun is hidden by a mere cloud.
Did you discover the Wi Je headquarters?
They came because they didn't receive orders, as the Queen is currently ill.
This is a very good opportunity.
If we successfully eliminate the Wi Je Group, even if Sa Taek family rises again, the dissolution of the Wi Je Group will be a terrible blow.
I shall destroy them.
Can you do it?
They killed my mother.
Also, they are the Queen's loyal servants.
I will wipe them out.
You need a poison powerful enough to kill hundreds of people?
Yes, ahjusshi.
I've known about Wi Je Group for a long time.
They are assassins serving the Sa Taek family and they have killed many innocent people.
Getting rid of them would be a precious opportunity.
You have to find a way.
Poison that can kill hundreds of people...
It's a difficult problem but who am I?
I am Im Ja, king of poison!
I'll find a way!
There are many ways to produce poison, but the most efficient one is to burn this cinnabar.
First, it was used as medicine, but when it hits fire, it releases a poison.
This one here looks like ordinary coal, but it has some very special properties.
When you burn it, it releases a fatal smoke.
This is a special, imported oil.
As it can catch fire, it is called kerosene.
It is more inflammable than normal oil.
How is it?
Will it be enough?
It is enough Ahjusshi.
Thank you.
You're very useful.
That is why I've never cried over all the money I gave you.
If I'm allowed to travel again, I can be even more helpful.
How is it?
So, you'd better give me some more money...
Do you want to run away to play?
I don't deserve such words...
If we want to eliminate Wi Je Group, we need the help of the rioters, too.
They have to risk their lives.
But, if we succeed, many innocent lives could be saved.
I'll do it.
I'll convince the guys to join me.
Don't reply so quickly.
You have to put your life on the line.
If that is the condition to eliminate the assassins who serve the Sa Taek family,
I'll do it!
My comrades died because of them!
My mother and my brother also died because of them!
You are not the only people in pain.
Those who had to leave their homes all feel the same.
Their lives have been robbed.
They will all regard this as a mission.
A family that rises by walking on innocent blood, will have to pay with blood for all the wrongdoings.
There must be a lot of pleople who hold grudges against the Sa Taek family and would consider this as a mission from heaven.
But if this continues, things will get worse.
The Sa Taek family has held onto power for too long.
They have misused their power and corrupted Baekje.
We can reduce the risk if we convince people that such a mission is just.
I'm begging you then.
It may be dangerous, but please gather the people who will join in this fight.
Everybody has gathered.
At sunrise, we're going to leave.
Be careful.
If I agree, it means rebelion.
Please consider that it is time I make that decision.
Please, do as you planned.
Gye Baek.
The feeling Your Highness talked about...
I know it too well.
I have been in the battle zone for a long time.
My feelings and my perceptions changed so many times.
What I feel now...
is that we must be extremely careful.
Something that we don't expect could be waiting for us.
If we continue to wait and ponder, we may lose our opportunity.
If we don't decide now, we may lose everything and have nothing in the future.
Once you make your decision, please don't doubt yourself.
Throw away your worry and nervousness.
Look forward and continue on.
I will do it that way.
Would you do the same, Your Highness?
Are you saying that you can't do it?
It seems that rumors about you are all wrong.
Are you from the palace?
You don't need to know.
Hey, hey, hey.
Wait.
When it comes to management, I'm the one you should talk with.
This guy is the fighter.
He doesn't know how to negotiate.
So, deal with me, with me.
Move.
Hey!
Oh my.
Ah you!
This guy.
Just because you're from the palace, do you think it's okay to push people around?
Just look at you!
What a poor disguise!
When you have to do a job, do it properly!
I'm talking to you, scoundrel!
You jerk...
You...
You are an official who came here incognito.
Do you want to die?
"Want to die?"
Look at the way this young one talks.
This, really?
You...
Do you think it is enough to have power and influence?
Fine.
Are you a senior official?
Looking at you, it seems rather impossible.
Gyo Gi.
Gyo Gi?
Oh!
Is there an official named Gyo Gi?
This is the first time hearing this.
Perhaps it's go-gi (meat)?
Maybe.
If you say Gyo Gi, then our 2nd prince is Gyo Gi...
Wait... then...
Maybe you...
You're not Prince Gyo Gi, are you?
It's the prince.
What are you guys doing?
Let's get out of here.
We might have another deal.
Do you know about Wi Je Group?
If you tell me, then I will do whatever you wish.
Why do you want to know that?
I have a debt to pay back.
Debt?
You're not worried about dying.
It's a debt important enough to bet my life on.
Say it.
What do you want to know?
I want to know the location of their headquarters.
You're really brave guys.
Those from Wi Je Group... don't fear danger.
They follow their faith.
And our faith... goes only to our Queen.
My body does not belong only to me.
Okay.
Give it a try.
If you get rid of all those guys, I'll take you in.
Please, look.
I was right.
As it is written here...
The Royal Hospital, Personnel and the Historical department...
Palace Affairs, Topography...
22 government departments in all.
Do they report to you only?
Each departmental chief has provided a hand-written confession.
They have always looked for your approval, excepting all of your schemes, although most of them have refused to give a written confession.
But he has already pocketed a very large amount.
Jo Jeong Jwapyeong, those confessions are clear evidence.
How do you explain this?
Why do you make me say the same thing over again?
This is defamation.
I am not even familiar with those persons.
As you can see, all these are allegations against Sa Taek Jeok Deok.
Just relying on these, we can convict Sa Taek Jeok Deok.
That Naesin Jwapyeong who usually follows behind Jeok Deok Sa Taek, has now betrayed him.
I'm really surprised.
Tomorrow, make an immediate announcement, and execute him.
Forgive your servant's audacity, your servant hopes that Your Majesty will not forget how General Mu Jin died.
First, we must separate the Queen from Sa Taek Jeok Deok.
After ensuring Your Majesty's safety, then we'll publicize what we're going to do.
If we don't do this, that side will try to influence the nobles again.
They might even retaliate using their military might.
Then what can we do?
Make sure Her Majesty continues to recuperate.
Sa Taek Jeok Deok is already a spent force.
Your Majesty, even if the Sa Taek family mobilizes their military force, if we take control of the palace and the capital city first, whatever action they take, they'll be a step behind.
To gain control of the palace and capital, we must first take control of the ministries and royal guards.
Presently, my son is at the ministries and royal guard division, trying to persuade them.
Therefore, right after dawn tomorrow, Your Majesty should use the excuse that the palace is undergoing repairs and move to a safe place.
Once Your Majesty has reached the safe place, we will immediately begin our insurrection.
Because there are still many noblemen who'll side with the Sa Taek family, even if the insurrection does not bring us what we wish for, it will at least ensure Your Majesty's safety.
They had in their cruel hands two thorns that were so very painful for us.
Nobles have always feared them.
But now the situation has reversed.
Your Majesty.
In my heart, Your Majesty, you have become the powerful king of Baekje.
You are the true king of Baekje.
I told you already... it was mutually decided that I would not accompany you!
My arms are hurting!
What's going on?
We're under attack!
Because of the toxic smoke, our men fainted.
Careful!
Hold your breath till you are out of here!
Yes.
Why are you so mean?
Do I belong to you, by chance?
What is that?
It looks like there was a fight.
Something happened to the Wi Je Group.
It seems others have arrived before us.
Aigoo!
We are late again!
Bul Hae let's retreat.They're probably dead.
Ah really.
Bul Hae, I'm begging you.
You should give up searching for revenge.
This is not good for you mental state.
Look at me.
Me too, because of the Wi Je people, I was consumed by the desire to get revenge.
After I let go of all my thoughts of revenge, look at my skin...
It's nice and smooth.
And do you see any gray hair?
You don't see any.
I used to have lots of gray hair but after letting go of all thoughts of revenge, all the gray hairs fell out and dark hair grew back in.
So what I'm saying is completely right.
Bul Hae, let's cancel this.
Everyone, we're going back!
Retreat!
One more word and you will really die.
Hurry up!
Go!
Am I bleeding?
A little bit.
Who are they?
I'm not sure, but they don't seem to come from the palace.
What's going on?
Ah, what is this?
Watch carefully.
The guys in black... those are the enemy.
Just kill the ones in black.
Take out your sword.
You, too.
Now get going.
Hey Il Yee,
I think the leader has just escaped.
I don't see him.
I don't know who you are but thank you for helping.
You have erased all our efforts.
Who are you?
Your words are crude.
So what if I'm crude?
Then I'd become crude, too.
Thank you for watching with us!
You execute them personally.
It's a royal command.
Hurry up and take the sword.
Deok Sol Gye Baek.
It's a capital offense to go against an order in a war.
Why are you still not taking the sword?
Your servant, Gye Baek,
Your Majesty's command,
I cannot accept it.
I knew you'd be like this.
You'd rather defy my order and risk death just to save the enemy's soldier, and earn eternal glory.
Somebody, come here.
Arrest Gye Baek, who dares to defy a royal command.
I'll execute him when we return to the palace.
Yes.
You, what did you just say?
Bong Seok and Go Dap So are dead?
-= Episode 28 =- Yes.
Furthermore, their remains were buried underneath the prison in Sabi City, so that the criminals can step on them.
Ui...
Ui...
Ui Ja!
I will never forgive you!
If I don't exterminate you and Baekje, if I don't exterminate you...
Ui Chan!
Ui Chan!
Get a hold of yourself, Ui Chan!
Your Majesty.
Get out!
Gye Baek was doing it for Your Majesty and Baekje's sake.
Miscreant!
Are you also going to defy my order now?
So I'm wrong and Gye Baek is right?
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty is correct.
But if you execute Gye Baek now, then Baekje's pillar will be gone.
Without Gye Baek, Baekje is unable to do anything.
Will it really come to that?
Fine, let me show all of you.
Without Gye Baek, I, Ui Ja can still do it.
I'll show you!
Servant!
Did you call for me, Your Majesty.
Get ready to move.
We're going to battle Seoribeol immediately.
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty.
Anybody who defies my command shall die.
Go and get ready to move out.
Your Majesty, please think twice!
Don't defy my order.
Seoribeol is only a day's ride from here.
We've just seized Daeha City, how can we now launch an attack on Seoribeol?
With our soldiers present morale, attacking Seoribeol will be easy.
It won't be Gye Baek but I, Ui Ja, who annihilates Silla.
This can't be, looks like we'll have to take His Majesty away forcibly.
Fine.
Your Majesty.
Quickly, follow His Majesty.
Enemy attack!
Prepare to fight.
Attack!
What's this talk about attacking Seoribeol?
The alcohol is making him impulsive.
We have to stop them.
Anyway, it's fortunate that Generals Ui Jik and Eun Sang will escort him back.
Don't be too worried.
Jwapyeong Sir, our troops were attacked!
His Majesty is missing.
What?
General, you must go and save His Majesty.
His Majesty was on his way to attack Seoribeol, when he was attacked and is now missing.
Where is everybody?
Ui Jik, Eun Sang!
Where are you?
Is there anyone here?
Your Majesty.
Gye Baek.
Your Majesty, get a hold of yourself.
Your Majesty.
Hurry up, carry His Majesty.
Hurry up!
Yes.
Stop it.
Kill me.
Don't be like this, let's leave together.
Don't talk nonsense, hurry up and kill me!
If mother were to see us like this, what do you think she'd say?
She'd be in so much pain that she'd be unable to say anything.
She'd be shedding tears of blood.
I told you not to talk nonsense!
The trauma sustained by the head injury seems to be more serious than the injury sustained from falling from the horse.
We can only treat him superficially here.
We cannot delay this.
Looks like we'll have to return to the palace.
Let's go together, General.
I can't.
Your Highness and jwapyeong should accompany His Majesty back to the palace.
I'll return after I've settled everything here.
You said you'll come later?
If the enemy senses that His Majesty's life is at stake, they'll seize this opportunity to strike back.
And furthermore, if His Majesty's condition is known, our soldiers' morale will drop.
Gye Baek is right.
Not only Silla, but within Baekje there'll be changes.
We must keep His Majesty's illness a secret.
In Sabi City there will be Silla spies as well.
You must protect His Majesty's position and come back with your head held high, and give the appearance as victor of this war.
Yes.
Tell them to ready the carriage.
Yes, sir.
-= Sabi City, Baekje =-
How is he?
Is His Majesty all right?
About that, I'm sorry but judging by his present condition, the conclusion doesn't look good.
You're unable to confirm?
Not only has he lost consciousness, but his body is cold and his pulse is weak.
Looks like it's a brain injury.
Looks like it's a brain injury.
Brain injury?
Then there's the possibility that he'll forever be in this condition and never recover from it?
Although we can remove the blood clots from the wound, we can't remove the clots that are lodged deep in his brain.
It's possible it could be worse than we've predicted.
Worse than what is predicted?
Is there a possibility His Majesty may die?
I am sorry.
Your Majesty.
How could this happen?
Your Majesty, please calm down!
Nothing is definite yet.
His Majesty will definitely wake up.
What security measures were in place for His Majesty, that he ended up like this?
Her Highness didn't do anything wrong.
If His Majesty should suffer any mishap,
I will not let the person who's responsible get away with it.
At a time when we were having an all out war, His Majesty collapsed.
Even if it was an unforseeable incident, it shouldn't have been this kind of incident.
Is there any way we can have a ceasefire with Silla?
We've already poured out the water.
(it's already too late)
His Majesty executed Bong Seok and Go Dap So.
Whether a war will break out, is not for us to decide.
If this news were to spread to Silla, this will become a major crisis.
Because of Daeha City, their enmity has escalated.
If they know of His Majesty's condition, they'll launch a massive attack on us.
The only people in the royal court who know of this matter, are daejwapyeong and the six of us who are are sitting here.
If other people learn of this, the Silla spies will get to know immediately.
Leaving aside the Silla spies, the noblemen and the Ministers, how long do we intend to conceal this from them?
The noblemen contributed the rations and their private soldiers to fight this war.
They will definitely want to be rewarded for this war.
Long live Your Majesty.
Long live General.
Yes, long live, 10 000 lives.
Long live Dok Gae.
What happened?
Why is it we don't see His Majesty, there's only General Gye Baek?
His Majesty?
His Majesty has already returned to the palace.
He has returned to the palace?
When?
When... that,
Come, come, come, about that...
To know the secret can harm you.
The harm sustained will be very serious.
The noblemen waiting for His Majesty, it's not just one or two.
When did he return to the palace so silently?
He's been unconscious for six days already?
The physician said he might not wake up.
Even if he finally wakes up, he won't be normal.
The after effects may be paralysis.
This is such a serious matter.
Is it really that serious?
Yes, it's not an ordinary matter.
What is the progress of the Silla army?
I have to return to the battlefield in a few days time.
Through our mole, we know that they're reassembling their soldiers in Seoribeol.
They'll be striking back very soon.
Can they strike back so quickly?
The hatred that Gim Chun Chu harbours for losing his daughter and son-in-law is petrifying.
Now an all out war is inevitable.
Silla will be launching a massive counterattack.
There's no change in His Majesty's condition.
Who will make the decisions in the royal court?
If we follow precedents, then the Queen should be his surrogate.
Then we must first install the Crown Prince, so that the Queen can manage the affairs of state.
Not only must we determine the Queen's surrogate powers, we must also decide on the position of the Great General to lead our army.
Great General?
This is the time when His Majesty isn't available, this is a special period.
What if there are dissatisfied people who are against this?
That's why this has to be decided by all the Generals.
It will also strengthen the capital's defences and security.
Of course, looking at the war situation at a glance, if there is going to be an all out war, there must be a capable person to take command of the entire army.
Then who is a suitable candidate for the position of the Great General?
General Gye Baek is the most suitable candidate.
General Gye Baek?
Although he has credibility, whether he should hold the position of Great General, is still doubtful.
What is byeonggwan jwapyeong's opinion?
I reckon the people and the soldiers trust only General Gye Baek.
But, I'm worried what His Majesty will think when he wakes up.
Looks like it's difficult for us to make such a decision.
We don't know yet whether we can get Her Majesty's consent.
Then, let us try to persuade the Queen.
Appoint General Gye Baek as the military commander?
If His Majesty knows of this, he will be really furious.
Your Majesty, your servant is fearful.
Now His Majesty is at the gates of hell, only you have the right to make decisions for Baekje now.
Although I believe in General Gye Baek's ability and credibility, to have to make such a decision is putting me under pressure.
Give it to another general or maintain the current status.
We are already facing an all out war with Silla,
All of us know General Gye Baek's capabilities on the war front.
Your Majesty, you must make a decision quickly, only then can we save Baekje.
Later, when His Majesty knows about this, he will not blame Your Majesty.
Then, let's just do that.
Great General?
How dare I?
It's too preposterous!
Now there's only you.
Don't we also have General Yun Chung or Generals Ui Jik and Eun Sang?
General Yun Chung is a war veteran.
Furthermore, Generals Eun Sang and Ui Jik's names were mentioned.
But they cannot shoulder this heavy responsibility.
Her Majesty the Queen has also given her consent, you can now take control.
Is it because of His Majesty?
Because of His Majesty, you are reluctant?
Are you afraid that you'll end up a military tyrant like Yeong Gye Somun?
Even if His Majesty is fearful, we have justification for doing this.
I will go to battle with my sword in hand.
The position of the Great General, give it to someone else.
The battle this time concerns the country's survival.
It will be an uphill battle.
But, the person who holds the position of the Great General, if his orders are different from yours, what will you do?
You will definitely defy his orders and do as per your own wishes.
No one is comparable to your capability in fighting a war.
That is not it.
Don't quibble.
You have 15 000 soldiers following you.
Now the soldiers of Baekje's royal army have become your troops.
The only person who can ward and hold off Silla's attack is you, Gye Baek.
Is it because you don't trust me?
Or are you afraid I'll become like Yeong Gye Somun, and become someone who'll manipulate Your Majesty?
Who has given all of you consent to liaise with Goguryeo secretly?
Don't any of you have any regard for my words?
And do any of you actually regard me as your king?
Your Majesty, you can't do it.
It's not me, looks like you're the King.
What are you thinking about that you didn't even notice somebody had come in?
I'm sorry, I'll leave now.
I heard you're holding the position of Great General now.
I've not decided yet.
Are you hesitating because of His Majesty?
His Majesty is very watchful of you, General.
If he wakes up he'll be very angry.
But... you holding the position of Great General,
is for the country's sake.
All you have to do is think of that.
Won't His Majesty be angry?
I'm telling you not to be afraid of His Majesty's wrath.
His Majesty will be watchful of you his whole life.
He's acting like this because he has committed a crime.
Did you say crime?
No, it is nothing.
Deok Sol Gye Baek, you are now the Great General.
General you're now the commander in chief of the armed forces.
You're to uphold the country's polity, and protect the royal family.
You must also defend us against Silla, and protect this place.
Your servant Gye Baek will comply with your order.
Now things have turned out like this.
Hyeong, sharpen it well, this is our lives.
(Hyeong - older brother)
Dae Su, Yong Su, I'm here.
I'm so tired.
Why are you in such a hurry?
Why are you not using honorifics?
When you're in a good mood you use them, and if you're in a foul mood you don't bother.
What's wrong with you?
You told me you'd quit drinking, but I saw you drinking on the last occasion, and you were carrying the jar around.
Why?
Dok Gae, when did I drink?
If you continue, I'll punish you using our martial laws.
Fine, I understand.
I'll keep your secret.
All of you didn't hear that, right?
Even if you did hear, pretend you didn't hear.
Our Yong Su will not drink.
He will just smell of wine.
You!
Fine, I understand.
There's another piece of good news.
Our General Gye Baek has been elevated to Great General.
All of you must be happy, right?
Is this true, Dok Gae?
General Gye Baek is now elevated to the commander in chief of Baekje's armed forces.
Why did they make him a Great General suddenly.
What's happening?
It's His Majesty who's the commander in chief, and there's also byeonggwan jwapyeong.
Why is the General holding that position?
Your mind is so shallow.
It's because His Majesty isn't well.
Didn't you both hear, on that last occasion, when His Majesty fell from his horse.
Wasn't it said he'd broken his leg, but his injuries weren't serious?
That... was said on purpose.
They said he's not sick, the sickness isn't serious and if he dies, they'll say he's not dead.
Why?
By doing that, it will ensure that all of you will continue to do your work well.
That's why they're doing this.
And also, come nearer.
I think His Majesty will be going to heaven soon.
What's going to heaven?
Die?
Yes, die.
Yes, die.
I said die.
We should prepare for that eventuality.
You should be careful what you say!
There's a possibility that Silla might be attacking here, what nonsense are you spreading?
The General has asked us to gather together.
Silla will be launching a massive attack soon.
From now on, our strategy is for all of you to go to each and every city and explain to them.
Yes.
Yong Su will go to Dongha City.
Dae Su will go to Daeha City, meet with the general there and then head to Gajamseong City.
The others, once you reach the city you're responsible for, go and tell the city lord of my orders.
The plan is the same.
No matter what, nobody is to leave the city.
We just have to focus on defending.
If anybody should leave the city, for whatever reason, they'll be punished according to martial law.
Tell everybody, until Silla retreats, they must defend the city at all costs.
Yes.
Why is it we can't attack, but we're to defend only?
I heard Gim Yu Sin is leading the army.
We must never underestimate Gim Yu Sin.
If we rush out of the city gates, we'll be robbed of the city.
If Silla delays their attack, that means Gim Yu Shin is trying to lure us out.
Therefore, if we don't attack, then Silla will have to retreat?
They won't retreat directly.
Wouldn't that be a defeat?
Then all you have to do is just attack them?
What?
How can I do it alone?
As long as I have you, that is sufficient.
You have to go to Goguryeo again.
Goguryeo?
Are you asking me to see Yeong Gye Somun again?
That's right.
Give this to him.
I heard from the Silla spies that Goguryeo is advancing to the south.
To the south?
Then is Goguryeo intending to attack Silla?
I will spread rumours.
We're going to join forces with Goguryeo and attack Silla.
This will divert their attention.
Yeong Gye Somun wants their territory back.
Once he receives this, he'll launch an immediate attack.
If that happens, Silla can only retreat.
Goguryeo is going to launch an attack on us?
Yes.
Goguryeo is still greedy for our territory.
So Baekje and Goguryeo are going to join forces and attack us.
This is really...
really too distressing!
Gather all the soldiers to guard the city now.
Tell Gim Yu Sin to guard the city well.
We just needed a few more days and our attack would have been successful.
It's such a pity that we have to retreat now.
It's a real pity, but now we can only retreat.
If we don't, we'll lose many more of our cities.
Go and tell Gim Yu Sin quickly.
I must definitely exterminate Baekje.
To revenge my daughter and son in law's deaths.
To take revenge for the bitterness of losing Daeha City.
The Silla army has retreated.
Gim Yu Sin's soldiers have also retreated.
Now that the Silla army has retreated, we can breath more easily.
It's all thanks to General Gye Baek that we can relax and rest easy.
The credit belongs to naesin jwapyeong and naedu jwapyeong, for persuading the Queen to choose General Gye Baek.
We just did what was necessary.
Let's go and tell the Queen the good news.
I'll go and tell her.
Must you really do that?
Then...
If this goes on, and if His Majesty should die, the situation will just become more chaotic.
You sound like you want His Majesty to die.
I'm really...
How can you think that of me?
Then, as you say, install Prince Hyo as the Crown Prince.
When did I say that I wanted Prince Hyo to be installed as the Crown Prince?
Then what is it you want exactly?
Do you want Her Majesty to continue like this?
Definitely, we have to choose one out of the two.
As you know very well, Her Majesty doesn't understand politics.
How long is she going to run the country?
What if the Queen were to trust some treacherous court official.
This will worsen the problem.
We cannot delay installing the Crown Prince.
Although they're still young, if we assist them, then things will be fine.
Just trust me.
Prince Tae is obedient to me, and will abide by my words.
Yes, that's right.
Out of the two, one will be the Crown Prince.
His Majesty is indisposed.
It's something that can't be helped.
I'm going to take what you've said, as you agreeing to us installing a Crown Prince.
But my thinking is different from yours.
Presently the prince is still young, he can only follow the views of the government body.
I'll just agree to this one matter.
Yes, yes,
No matter what your reason is, as long as Prince Tae becomes the Crown Prince, that's fine with me.
I'm so happy to hear that naesin jwapyeong is also agreeable to helping our Tae be installed as the Crown Prince.
In such a dire situation, I will abide and follow my brother.
So, this coming Council meeting, it's confirmed that our Tae will be installed as the Crown Prince?
We can't be sure yet.
There are still many people who are against it.
And also,
We can't ignore those who support Prince Hyo.
Great General will also be against it.
Does General Gye Baek want Hyo to be installed as the Crown Prince?
No, that's not it.
I understand.
The best way to go about it is to convince the Great General.
Could it be, that the two of you are unable to convince him?
I can't agree with the two of you.
I am a military man.
A military man only has to protect the country.
Rather than supporting either, I'm neutral.
The person whom you support will be the victor.
Although you may not realise it, that's your influence as a Great General.
Without me, the two of you can still make use of the noblemen during the Council meeting to make the right choice.
Do you want to continue being neutral?
Yes.
Even if the royal consort pleads with you?
Definitely.
It's settled then.
Not opposing but being neutral, is also a good thing.
All of you understand what I mean?
Of course.
The Queen is meeting regularly with the noblemen.
How many people do we have on our side who are supporting Hyo?
We have two on our side, daejwapyeong and jojeong jwapyeong.
There are five supporting Prince Tae.
If this continues we'll fail, and Buyeo Tae will be the Crown Prince.
What happened to all those noblemen whose weaknesses we held in our hands?
They're leaning towards the Queen.
I heard that they've been promised they'll be exempted from punishment.
They're flip-flopping this way and that way, such crafty people.
Your Highness.
If we fail this time then we're finished.
Is there any other way?
Now, the best way to get around this problem is for His Majesty to wake up.
Don't be too worried.
His Majesty will not die so easily.
How long has he been lying there in a coma.
Even the physicians say there's no hope.
His Majesty shouldn't have initiated the killing spree there.
His Majesty is in this condition because the spirits of those who died unjustly are punishing him.
But...
His Majesty will wake up.
Do you know when he'll wake up?
If this continues and the Crown Prince is installed, then everything will have ended for us.
If you're so worried, I'll pray for you.
His Majesty only loves you.
So if His Majesty were to die, then you should sacrifice yourself and be buried with him.
What you've just said.
If His Majesty wakes up, I'll make sure to tell him that.
Your Highness.
Calm down.
Didn't Sinyeo tell you to trust her?
How can I just wait like this?
Isn't it because we don't have a solution?
How can there be none?
Is His Majesty the only person who can turn things around?
Then, you're not thinking of...
Great General, Gye Baek.
He has the power.
General Gye Baek has that kind of power.
What?
You want me to seek out General Gye Baek on your behalf?
Please help me.
It's better for you to speak directly to him.
I've sent him a letter, but he has rejected it.
If that's the case, I won't do it.
Then his intention to reject is clear.
Is it because you want General Gye Baek to support Prince Hyo?
Don't do that.
Aren't you trying to make use of his feelings for you?
For Hyo's sake, I will do anything.
Your Highness.
If Hyo doesn't become the Crown Prince, then he will not be able to live.
If you want to save Hyo and I, please seek out the General on my behalf.
What do you want to say to me here?
That...
What am I doing?
What's the matter?
If I don't do this, you won't see me.
I don't want to take part in the politics.
I know.
But General, you're the only person whom I can ask to help.
Your Highness.
Please help me
General.
The only person whom I can rely on is you, General.
To help your child be installed as the Crown Prince?
When His Majesty dies, everybody will follow you.
General, please help Hyo.
The installation of the Crown Prince is not something I can control.
Not even at my request?
Your Highness has made an erroneous request.
I am leaving now.
Hyo must be installed as the Crown Prince.
Only then, only then can I return to your side.
I Eun Go, fell into His Majesty's despicable trap.
It's because there was no way out for me, that I left you.
That...
What do you mean by that?
If Hyo were to succeed the throne,
I will return to your side.
Do you know who this person is?
Isn't he General Gye Baek?
Your life, whether it's to be extinguished, is in the General's hands.
Whatever you have done, tell him honestly.
You received His Majesty's orders to deliver a petition of complaint to the late king.
Yes, General.
So, the finding of guilt of the Mok clan, was all His Majesty's evil scheme?
That's the absolute truth.
Whatever might make His Highness suspicious, I've forestalled it.
You, should go and monitor the people from Eun Go's side.
To monitor those who are close to agassi, (Agassi - young lady) we shouldn't do this.
And you're asking me to do it.
I can't do it.
How is it that you don't know this is a preventive measure that we have to take?
This is concerning Eun Go.
Apart from you who else is able to do it?
Why didn't you discuss this with me?
Discuss?
You clearly said that as long as Eun Go can be saved, you're even willing to sacrifice your life.
Furthermore Eun Go's situation now is because of you.
Because she wanted to save you.
But...
What have you done to save Eun Go?
Your Highness!
I don't know who was first.
Whether it was you who secretly loved Eun Go first, or it was me who secretly fell in love with her first.
or it was me who secretly fell in love with her first.
Who else knows of this matter?
General.
I asked you, who else knows of this matter?
Naesin jwapyeong and naedu jwapyeong, both are aware of this.
General.
Go away temporarily.
What?
I can't believe this.
It's just like what happened to my father.
I have misunderstood you,
I want to think like that.
You knew that Eun Go agassi was like my own life, but you destroyed us behind our backs,
just so you could possess her.
For such a long time.
Eun Go agassi and I,
were played with by Your Majesty.
Did we fall into your trap?
You...
Did Gye Baek call you as well?
What is the matter?
Do both of you remember this place?
Isn't this the place where His Majesty and the three of us swore to be blood brothers?
Please take it back.
I don't need these personal effects anymore.
What do you mean by that?
The person who'd use this sword to protect his master, no longer exists.
What is wrong?
Can it be, perhaps...
You know too!
The oath that we took here, was supposed to be complied with by all of us.
But one person broke it.
That person was His Majesty.
Gye Baek.
When I was standing here on that fateful day, what we promised each other,
not even for a day, not even for a moment have I forgotten.
I Gye Baek,
I've been living alone all this while, but now, with my brothers, we'll forge ahead together.
Our paces, are paces that will lead us to a new world.
That world, will be a world where people will have no regrets.
No injustice, and a world without tears.
No revenge, and no bloody feud.
A world without orphans and refugees.
We brothers will move forward in that direction.
Even if we're blocked by the mountains, even if we're cordoned off by water, we'll still continue to march forward.
If any of my brothers should get tired and fall,
I will carry him, and together we'll march forward.
I do swear.
I do swear.
I do swear.
I do swear.
Why?
Why did you conceal it from me during that period?
We reckoned that was the best thing to do then.
That's correct, at least my heart was happier that way.
Now, whether you want to scold us or beat us up, do as you please.
Look here...
Why?
Since everything is out in the open now, what else is to be left unsaid?
His Majesty snatched away his younger brother's woman, and we, with great trepidation, covered it up.
That's right, we brothers have lied to you.
We are sorry, Gye Baek.
We have sinned against you, and are now pleading for your forgiveness.
What then is faith?
What are moral principles?
If you don't have those qualities...
What am I going to do now?
What shall I do?
How can I go on living from now on?
The outcome is still this.
Why must this happen at this time?
Friend!
Come!
The Silla army has retreated.
That's such a relief!
It's because we have General Gye Baek, and they dare not come.
You're right, as long as we have General Gye Baek, we don't have to be afraid of Silla.
Our Baekje General will protect us.
We're able to live in peace because of General Gye Baek.
Yes, yes, someone whom we should be grateful to.
The person whom we should thank for giving Baekje such a person is God.
Yes, yes.
Come, let's drink.
It's really good that the Silla people have left.
It feels really good.
You said this previously.
It's not for the sake of the king who rules Baekje, but for the sake of Baekje.
So you're protecting Baekje not because of the king, you're protecting Baekje for the sake of the commoners.
Gye Baek.
You are not His Majesty's follower, neither are you Her Highness' follower.
And you are definitely not our follower.
You belong to Baekje, you belong to the people.
You asked, what is faith?
This so-called loyalty refers to returning the trust others put in you.
And it further means to protect those who believe in you.
Pick up your sword.
You are Baekje's Great General.
You're right, as long as we have General Gye Baek, we don't have to be afraid of Silla.
Our Baekje General will protect us.
We're able to live in peace because of General Gye Baek.
Yes, yes, someone whom we should be grateful to.
The person whom we should thank for giving Baekje such a person is God.
It's good to be able to see you like this.
In future, I would like to see you like this.
You shouldn't be like that.
Your Highness cannot leave His Majesty now.
At a time when His Majesty is dying,
Your Highness must protect His Majesty.
Don't you realise what His Majesty has done to the two of us?
I do.
If you know, why are you still saying that?
Because I want to keep my faith.
Faith?
To who?
The faith between His Majesty and you was broken long ago.
Who are you keeping the faith for now?
For the people and the country.
Not to the king, but I want to keep the faith with my country, Baekje.
A long time ago, when Your Highness left me,
didn't you say this?
That I've not lost Your Highness to His Majesty, instead I've dedicated you to Baekje.
That's how I want to remember it.
I've been able to go on living because of those words.
That I've dedicated you to Baekje.
And also dedicated myself, first and foremost, to Baekje.
Your Highness, I too belong to Baekje.
When Baekje needs you, no matter how much pain you're suffering, you'll have to endure it.
I will also continue to endure this pain.
Therefore to ask me to support Prince Hyo, that's something unacceptable to me.
Let the matter of the Crown Prince be decided at the Council meeting.
No matter who becomes the Crown Prince, I will protect him faithfully.
Agassi.
Don't ever address me in that way again.
I saw you meeting up with Gim Il that night.
Why must you go and meet with a dangerous person like him?
Did you think I liked going to meet Gim Il?
They are now many edicts requesting that Eun Go Jang Sa be punished.
It's all because she wanted to save you, Deok Sol Sir.
What are you saying?
It's all because agassi met Gim Il, who persuaded the other noblemen, (Agassi - young lady) that you, Deok Sol Sir, are able to maintain your status.
Eun Go Jang Sa, there's an imperial order for your arrest.
All you villains, don't you dare touch even one hair on her head.
Don't act so recklessly.
Arrest her immediately!
-=Episode 23=-
For her to gather so many nobles in such a short period of time, isn't that obvious?
Your Majesty, we don't have any evidence linking Jang Sa directly to any corruption.
But the fact of the Mok family receiving bribes has been ascertained.
During that time the noblemen associated themselves with the Mok family, who controlled the meeting.
What's the difference between them and the Sa Taek family?
Come here!
Did you call for me, Your Majesty?
Seize all the family members of the Mok family residing in Sabi City, and also arrest those noblemen who offered bribes to the Mok family.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Arrest all of them!
What's the matter?
Get on the ground!
Seize him.
It's not my fault.
It's all Eun Go Jang Sa's orders
I'm just following her orders.
This is the outcome.
I had a feeling she'd get into trouble.
When she gathered the noblemen, I already had my doubts.
But didn't she do this to save Gye Baek?
She should have looked for another way and not allowed things to become like this.
No matter what, Eun Go is our comrade and also the person who Gye Baek has feelings for.
We have to think of a way to save her.
How could I refuse to think of a way to save her?
I'm just voicing my displeasure that she tried to influence the noblemen.
First of all, Miss Eun Go's offence is misuse of public power for personal gain.
-=Misuse of public power for personal gain: discarding one's principles and using one's powers for personal gain.=- First of all, Miss Eun Go's offence is misuse of public power for personal gain.
This is a crime where the punishment is 100 paddles and then banishment.

There's no direct evidence of Eun Go agassi receiving bribes.
If she were to say that she didn't know of her uncle's misdeeds, at best they've only an indirect link to the crime.
As long as she sticks to this story, we'll be able to find a way to save her.
Yes, that's right.
Are you two discussing how you can save Eun Go Jang Sa?
Your Highness, Crown Princess.
I've heard that the two of you are the Crown Prince's advisors and loyal servants, how then can you try to shield such a criminal?
Jang Sa used His Highness' affection for her and arbitrarily made decisions concerning national affairs.
The person who requested His Majesty to appoint a member of the Sa Taek family as the daejwapyeong.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Don't the two of you see that as a crime?
To allow such a woman to live will only allow evil to spread in the future.
Your Highness, please calm down!
Please stay calm.
No.
I will not sit idly by and do nothing.
Her crimes are now before His Majesty.
The two of you need not interfere in this matter.
If you do, even if you're a loyal servant, I will not forgive you.
Your Majesty.
Do you want to see me concerning some matter?
I was the first person who conducted an investigation into the Mok family.
I know this matter better than anyone else.
Eun Go Jang Sa is innocent.
She was dragged into this quagmire by her uncle's offence.
Then do you think that I framed Jang Sa?
Your Majesty.
it's not something you should concern yourself with.
I will personally conduct the investigation and find out the truth.
Your Majesty, I'm begging you, please forgive Jang Sa Eun Go.
You're so eager to shield her, it looks like you must owe her.
Were you and Jang Sa acting together in gathering the noblemen, so that the meeting would decide in your favour?
Your Majesty, your servant didn't make that kind of a request.
But, if I was the cause of this matter, I'll accept responsibility for it.
Your servant will resign and leave, please forgive Jang Sa.
I don't want to hear anymore!
The truth will emerge upon investigation.
Jang Sa's innocence or guilt will be decided then.
Leave now.
Your Majesty.
Do you want to say what Gye Baek has just said?
Please be lenient in your punishment.
Jang Sa is the heroic official who got rid of the Sa Taek family.
Even if she's found guilty, we shouldn't convict a loyal servant.
To pardon a loyal servant who has committed a wrong, isn't that a better way of dealing with it?
Is that your only reason for trying to shield her?
I know you like her.
Your affection for her is out of the ordinary.
That's why she made used of it to decide matters concerning national affairs.
When something so serious happens, your responsibility is heavier, Crown Prince.
Your Majesty.
The way I see it, if Jang Sa acts like that, there'll come a day where the Mok family will be the second Sa Taek family.
Evil must be rooted out before it spreads.
Eun Go.
Your Highness.
Very soon His Majesty will conduct your trial.
His Majesty is absolutely livid this time, there's no other way.
You just have to say that you had nothing to do with your uncle's misdeeds.
Only by doing that can you save your life.
Your Highness, I can't do that.
Eun Go.
My uncle and the other members of the Mok family returned to Sabi City because of me.
Even if they're guilty,
I must protect them and help them.
I can't just save myself and leave them to die.
Your life will be in grave danger.
I'm sorry, Your Highness.
Have you really made up your mind?
That won't do.
I will save you, I will certainly save you.
Jang Sa Eun Go, listen!
I was impressed with your abilities and therefore appointed you the Jang Sa.
But you coveted wealth and plotted secretly with the noblemen, and discarded your responsibilities.
This is the crime of abuse of power.
Do you plead guilty?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Your servant has committed a crime.
I am fully responsible for everything.
So, you're admitting to all your crimes?
Yes, therefore I beg you to release the rest of my family members.
Our whole family has in the past suffered grave injustice.
It wasn't easy for them to have survived.
Please forgive us our wrongs.
Let me shoulder the full responsibility.
You want to bear this responsibility all by yourself?
Yes, Your Majesty.
We can't do that.
This is the evidence of bribes received by your Mok family from the noblemen.
You are the Crown Prince's loyal servant.
Relying on you, your Mok family became lawless.
If we allow these things to manifest, when the Crown Prince ascends the throne, it will become an impediment.
Your Majesty.
They will all be severely punished.
Record the Jang Sa's confession and punish all the members of the Mok family.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.
I'm begging you to let the Mok family go.
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!
How did it go?
Agassi's uncle has been beheaded.
All the other members of the Mok family are to be banished.
They can't step inside Sabi City again.
That's really serious.
Our guild won't be let off either.
Who's the person in charge of Daeheng Guild?
I'm the representative of Daeheng Guild.
This guild is involved in corruption.
Therefore you have to pay a penalty of three times the amount of the bribes.
From today onwards this guild will be closed, and all personnel are to leave Sabi City.
This is an imperial edict.
Carry out the order.
Yes!
I said it's painful, why are you pressing my back?
Stop pressing, really...
If this pain continues, my back will break soon.
Such a small needle, how can he get well?
What did you say?
I can't turn my head either.
That really hurts.
Just one needle and you'll be cured.
Isn't it because I want to get well quickly that I allowed the use of needles?
That's why I say... but why are you taking out a knife?
What's this?
A knife?
This is a needle.
This is really good if you want to get well fast.
Just you wait and see.
Wait, wait!
It doesn't hurt anymore.
I don't feel any pain.
Even if I don't get acupuncture, I won't feel the pain any more.
You can leave now.
I'm fine now, fine now.
How can it be so?
Didn't you say it's going to break anytime now?
Just now when my back was so painful it felt like breaking.
This needle, no... knife, the moment I saw the knife, my bones united and gave me my strength.
They've healed themselves.
Therefore I'll be fine, even without acupuncture.
You can leave now, doctor.
Will you really be fine?
It's better for you to have acupuncture.
Is this acupuncture?
More like being cut with a knife.
If I shout my back starts trembling.
You had better leave, go quickly and leave with your needle.
Go quickly, run and go.
Run, hurry up and run.
Why did you bring a person who comes bearing a knife?
I told you to bring a doctor.
Dok Gae elder, Dok Gae elder.
What's the matter?
The people whom we were trailing, have been arrested.
Their relatives also.
Looks like we've gained some merit points.
That is of course.
They're corrupt noblemen who did not observe the law.
We've performed a great deed, this is great.
Then do you think I can use that merit to become an official?
You're such a simpleton.
Just think, not just any official but one who specialises in investigating the noblemen.
Investigating officer?
Then we'll be able to come into contact with money.
We can now go about making big deals.
Now we can start to stand proudly and be men.
Right.
But there's a problem.
What's the problem?
What?
Didn't Gye Baek hyeongnim tell us to look after those things carefully?
(Hyeongnim - respected older brother)
Yes, he did.
But something seems to be missing.
Why don't you rack your brains and think about what's missing from your head?
But what is missing?
At that time Dok Gae hyeongnim was...
Hold on.
Dae Su, you coming close to me makes my back suddenly... start to get painful.
Seems this won't do.
I think I'll go to the medical centre myself.
Wasn't I supposed to get acupuncture?
I think I'll rest at home.
It's really painful.
Wait a moment.
What are you two trying to do?
What do you two think you're doing?
I'm a patient.
Am I not sick?
Let go of me.
What are you trying to do?
Gently, gently.
Shake him.
What's the shaking for.
What is it that dropped?
What are these things?
Whose are these?
Didn't these things fall from your bodies?
Official... has now turned into nothingness.
Agassi.
Agassi.
Are you satisfied now?
Are you happy to see our whole family being punished?
Agassi.
I'm so disillusioned.
You didn't even say a word to me that you were investigating my family.
If our positions were reversed, I wouldn't have done what you did.
If you and your family were guilty, if it was me, I would have tried to save you first.
I'm sorry agassi.
It's all my fault.
It's too late.
Everything's over now.
No.
I will, I definitely will save you.
Save me?
My only relatives are dead, and the guild that I had built up is going to collapse.
I've lost everything, how do you expect me to go on living?
If I were to lose you, I would die too.
Seems like I'm living in a nightmare now.
You must be suffering greatly, Agassi.
There's nothing I can do for the person whom I care about.
But one thing is certain,
I will save you, Agassi.
I will definitely do so.
You should go back.
Agassi.
Go home.
Gye Baek.
Seong Chung hyeongnim, Heung Su hyeongnim.
Please help me.
Please save Eun Go agassi.
Have a seat first.
Even if we were carried off by a tiger, as long as we stay calm and alert, we can still live.
We must stay calm and think of a solution.
What measures can we think of?
His Majesty is fuming.
As long as it can definitely save Eun Go agassi,
I'm willing to do anything.
You're not even scared of His Majesty?
Let us first file a joint petition.
Eun Go Agassi is a loyal servant, and if we emphasise that we might be able to get her acquitted.
If there's no agassi, there's no me.
I'm betting everything on this.
I knew you'd do this!
Are you going to break her out of prison?
Hyeongnim.
Follow me.
I can't do that.
I must save Agassi.
I'm going to call out for people.
Sit, you brat!
So after the prison break, what do you intend to do?
I will leave here with Agassi.
After that?
After that?
You wish to have children with agassi and live a good life?
After that?
I've not thought so far ahead.
Do you intend to live the life of a fugitive forever?
Together with your children as well?
You mustn't think like that.
How can a hero of Baekje live forever as a fugitive.
Furthermore, what will happen to our promise to put in our best efforts to benefit the people?
Then what do you want me to do?
Watch agassi die?
I can't do that, I absolutely can't!
I must save agassi.
Gye Baek.
Don't stop me.
Brat, sit down!
Calm down!
Sit down, brat!
Can't we just hide somewhere temporarily, and wait until the Crown Prince ascends the throne.
He'll be able to save me then.
Yes, what you say is correct.
The Crown Prince doesn't want to see her die either.
There's no need for you to do anything.
He will think of a plan.
His Majesty is so furious, what plan can the Crown Prince have?
The Crown Prince won't let Eun Go agassi die.
Even if he has to sacrifice his own life, he'll save Eun Go.
How the Crown Prince treats Eun Go agassi...
The special way that His Highness treats Eun Go, you know too, don't you?
We understand your feelings of anxiety, but let's wait for a while.
If you were to break into the prison, it will only complicate matters.
Eun Go... what must I do to be able to save you?
My mind has been distressed these past few days.
But, I can only think of one way to save you.
Follow what I tell you, and you'll be able to live.
Say you're pregnant with a dragon child.
-=Dragon child: pregnant with a child of a member of the royal family=-
They won't kill a pregnant woman.
All the more so, if she's pregnant with a dragon child.
Although this is pitiful, this is the only method that can save you.
Can you do it?
I can't do it.
I've already lost my pitiful uncle and all my family members.
My merchant guild is also gone.
How can I live?
By myself, how am I supposed to go on living?
What is there to live for?
It's better to be dead.
If you were to die, what would I do?
I've been with you since we were young.
We've gone through so many tribulations and crises together.
In my deepest and darkest despair, you were the one who held on to me.
I felt like I was reborn.
Then following your advice, I persisted with my determination to become the King.
You saved me when I wanted to die.
At that time I swore I'd be one with you.
If you were to die, what would I do?
I'd also want to follow you.
Your Highness.
Your Highness, what are you saying?
I'm not here to ask for your consent.
Remember this, you and I are of one life.
If you were to die, I would die too.
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
That can't happen.
What should I do?
Then what about Gye Baek.
What will happen to our Gye Baek?
Do you think that you can accomplish such a great deed single-handedly.
What Agassi should protect is not the stars, it's the world of Baekje that lies beneath the stars.
The world?
To enter the shrine requires His Majesty's permission.
I'm not even a member of the royal family, how can I help you?
You will be able to help me.
Heaven will help you.
The Crown Prince already has the Crown Princess.
She's married to him, and has borne his child.
How can you be saying such things to me?
Isn't the Crown Princess someone you arranged for His Highness?
Her fate follows the path you dictate for her.
Isn't that so?
Isn't that so?
How is that possible?
Did you think that as long as you strive hard then the world will change?
Unfortunately not.
How can people go against heaven's will?
You must be feeling very miserable.
Crown Princess.
You have only yourself to blame.
It was because you persuaded the Crown Prince to allow the Sa Taek family to rise again.
It's something you should have expected, isn't it?
You, can't blame anyone.
The person who killed your family is you.
Is that so?
That's why my family's fate turned out like that?
His Majesty has decided that you'll be beheaded tomorrow before all the officials, civil and military.
But...
I don't wish for you to die such an easy death.
You should have just killed me right from the start.
Why did you have to kill so many innocent people?
Are you having regrets now?
Yes, you must be regretting it now.
Crown Princess.
I, Eun Go, will not die so easily.
Criminal Eun Go, who attempted to get the noblemen to plot against the country, will be beheaded in front of all the officials, military and civil, and the people.
After watching this, everyone should be cautious.
Gye Baek, stay calm.
Gye Baek, stay calm.
Agassi, I must go to agassi.
Let me go.
The Crown Prince hasn't made an appearance yet.
Please wait a while.
Agassi is going to die now, what is there to wait for?
Let go of me!
Gye Baek!
The Crown Prince was so immersed in racking his brains for a solution that he didn't even meet us for the past few days.
He must surely have a solution to this.
If he didn't have a plan, he would have consulted us.
Your Highness.
Your Highness.
Your Highness.
I'm begging you, save agassi.
As long as Eun Go gets to live, you'll be able to accept any consequences?
Yes, as long as agassi can live, I can even sacrifice my life.
Hold on!
Your Majesty, you can't kill Eun Go.
Everything has already been said and done.
Your Majesty.
You can't kill Eun Go.
What?
You can't kill a woman who's carrying a dragon child.
Dragon child?
Is what the Crown Prince said a fact?
Is that a fact?
It's true.
You had better kill the dragon child together with me.
Crown Princess!
Crown Princess!
Is she pregnant?
Just follow what I told you to do.
But, Your Highness.
You've served His Majesty your whole lifetime.
If anything should happen to His Majesty, the responsibility will be too great for you to bear.
If his aged Majesty should collapse from anger, you can't avoid the responsibility.
But, if you were to stand on my side and be my follower, you will be my right-hand person.
you will be my right-hand person.
Her pulse indicates she's pregnant.
So what shall we do now?
We'll have to follow what the Crown Prince said.
There's nothing we can do about a person who's carrying a dragon child.
We'll have to wait until she gives birth.
Put her under house arrest until she gives birth.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Is this his plan to save Eun Go agassi?
What is the Crown Prince thinking?
I don't understand what's going on now.
Hyeongnim, please explain it to me.
I'm sorry.
Then what will happen to Eun Go agassi now?
If they discover that it's a fake pregnancy, she'll be executed, or she'll have to get pregnant now.
Pregnant?
Even if she's really pregnant, we won't know what will happen after she gives birth.
But if Eun Go were to become the Crown Prince's consort, that will make a difference.
What are you saying?
For Eun Go to become the Crown Prince's consort?
Nothing is definite yet, don't think too much.
But there's something that I'd like to ask you.
Did you give the petition to the Crown Prince?
Yes.
Why... are you avoiding me?
What are you trying to say?
There's only one way to save her.
Why didn't you discuss this with me?
Discuss?
You clearly said that as long as Eun Go can be saved, you're even willing to sacrifice your life.
Furthermore Eun Go's situation now is because of you.
Because she wanted to save you.
But...
What have you done to save Eun Go?
Your Highness!
I don't know who was first.
Whether it was you who secretly loved Eun Go first, or it was me who secretly fell in love with her first.
That...
What are you saying?
What are you saying?
Just as I've said.
I gave up Eun Go for you.
I've made a lot of sacrifices for you.
Gave up my affections, but... the outcome is this.
Your Highness.
You're too incompetent.
You don't have the ability to protect the person you love.
You weren't able to protect Eun Go, because you were the one who made her suffer.
Then, let me be the one to save Eun Go.
Are you looking for me?
We received orders from within the palace to commend your meritorious service.
The petition that we requested you to hand over to His Majesty, was able to dispel the bad atmosphere.
Is that so?
It's because we got hold of the petition that we did that.
Continue to keep this confidential, so that the Crown Prince's mind will be at ease, and he can therefore continue to give you work to do.
I will keep that in mind.
Good.
Really, this is His Highness's scheme right from the start.
It's all because he wanted to separate Gye Baek and Eun Go, that he's scheming all this.
Really!
How could he use such despicable methods.
In order to have one woman, he abandoned his principles.
Should we inform Gye Baek of this or not?
How can we tell him?
Their relationship will be destroyed.
Gye Baek will then no longer acknowledge His Highness as his leader.
Then should we just let him be ignorant of this matter?
And turn ourselves into people without consciences?
Isn't it that His Highness has secretly been in love with Eun Go agassi from eons ago?
We can't see completely what goes on in a relationship between a man and a woman.
We must add in complexity and subtlety to the picture.
It's because you don't understand that, you don't know what to do.
Yes, I don't know any of those things.
But for a man who's going to become the king, to do such a despicable act,
I can't tolerate it.
What do you want to do?
Gye Baek needs to know of this.
The Crown Prince must return Eun Go agassi to Gye Baek, and allow them to leave and build a life somewhere far away.
When the Crown Prince ascends the throne, then he can bring them back, that would do, right?
Don't act rashly.
Do you think at this moment, His Highness will listen to you?
Setting a trap for Eun Go, pushing her to the point of death and carrying out his scheme.
The person whom you want to go up against is the Crown Prince.
Do you think he achieved his present position just by relying on our strength and power?
You're underestimating him.
Decades spent living under the watchful eye of the Sa Taek Queen, and he managed to survive that.
I reckon before you can open your mouth about Gye Baek, he'll get rid of you too.
What did you say?
Furthermore, compared to any other matter, so far we've not achieved our goals.
That is to ensure that the people will have better days ahead.
Can you abandon our great cause for the sake of one woman?
We must cover this up.
As long as we take this to our grave, that will do.
This is something that we shouldn't have known right from the beginning.
This is really...
The only person who is pitiful is Gye Baek.
The wind is cold, please go inside.
Fine.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, are you all right?
How is it?
I'm still unable to diagnose it at this time.
You don't have to hide anything from me.
I know my own body very well.
The injury caused by the Wi Jie faction wasn't treated, and I ingested some marijuana.
That confirms it then.
Marijuana?
It's a drug that can kill a healthy man.
I've just started to enjoy my life, 30 years have already passed and my disease has recurred.
Isn't it time for repayment?
Your Majesty.
Bring Eun Go here.
Yes.
How did you get in here?
Agassi.
Leave this place with me.
I'm no longer fixated with this place.
You too shouldn't be fixated with this place any longer.
Let's leave together for a place uninhabited by man.
As you can see for yourself, I've nothing left.
No matter what, I must recover all that I've lost.
How can I leave this place?
Wait and see, what I, Eun Go, will do in the future.
Wait and see clearly.
That... is something that you don't have to do.
But if you let go off my hand now, you can never again grasp hold of it.
Ever.
Can you really forget me completely?
Agassi... please.
Gye Baek.
Give me some time to think about this.
What else do you want to consider?
After escaping, what are the two of you going to do?
If Baekje's hero, and the woman whom the Crown Prince is going to marry were to flee, what will the common people think?
Even after I ascend the throne and pardon the two of you, will the court ministers and the common people forgive the two of you?
Fine, if you're confident, then leave.
Go ahead and flee.
What happened just now,
I'll pretend I didn't see anything.
Your Majesty.
I know for a fact that you've not committed a crime, but I still went ahead and sentenced you to death.
Do you know why?
In you,
I saw the shadow of Queen Sa Taek.
Concerning the matter of bestowing on you the title of Crown Prince's consort,
I've consented.
But you must bear in mind, that you must absolutely not allow yourself to be controlled by the noblemen.
You must assist Ui Ja earnestly.
Focus on strengthening the imperial power.
You absolutely mustn't follow in Queen Sa Taek's footsteps.
Do you understand?
I will keep that in mind.
One more thing.
The Crown Prince will be Tae.
-= Buyeo Tae:
The son of Ui Ja and Yeon Tae Yeon. =- The Crown Prince will be Tae.
-= Buyeo Tae:
The son of Ui Ja and Yeon Tae Yeon. = = Buyeo Tae:
The son of Ui Ja and Yeon Tae Yeon. =- In the future, any problem concerning the Crown Prince, you must not interfere.
Can you swear to this?
I promise.
You can leave.
He must be inside.
Has the sky fallen?
Just have a drink with your brothers and everything will be forgotten.
Gye Baek, you brat.
A good person just going to waste.
Right, nothing we can say can comfort you at the moment.
You must feel the pain.
If that's not your fate, what can be done?
This happened in order to allow you to meet someone much better than her.
Yes, to miss someone who's no longer around is heartbreaking, but you can still continue to miss someone who's still alive.
I know your heart is forlorn.
But if you can understand, this is the best solution.
No, this is our destiny.
Let me make this clear to you.
It's because I want to live, that I made this agreement with you.
And you, Your Highness, will only have my body.
Your heart, will forever remain with Gye Baek, is that what you mean?
To me, my woman, will forever be you.
It's because I have you, that I can endure, and go through so many hardships.
But, I can't make even a tiny headway into your heart?
I, Ui Ja, don't mean anything at all to you?
I,
have only respect for you, Your Highness.
-=Next Episode Preview=-
It looks like Eun Go isn't pregnant.
Kill me instead and spare Eun Go.
Really, what's the worth of a woman, to be fought over like that?
You will forget someday.
Are you happy?
Only I am the master of this piece of Baekje sky.
General Gye Baek is now in the midst of a war, don't you trust him completely?
The preparation for launching the attack is complete.
Let's go according to our plans.
Gye Baek is the real hero of this country.
Your servant Gye Baek is paying his respects to Your Majesty.
Why is it that you've not expressed it even once?
It's because I want to take my revenge on you.
Between Your Majesty and me, what else is left?

I'm fixing a mistake.
This should have been on your finger a long time ago.
Chin Ho Kelly,
I would like nothing more than to be your wife.
Mmm... are you going to get that?
Get what?
Kelly.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Victim's name is Bethany Morris.
She was a reporter for the Pacific Register.
What happened?
Based on the abraded injuries and splinters in her hands, it would seem that the victim was hiding before she was dragged out from under her bed.
So that's when her neck was broken.
Correct.
It's very sad.
Yes.
Besides that, we have no prints, no signs of forced entry.
Perp was in and out, very clean, very quick.
So I just got off the phone with a Henry Dobson, Bethany's editor.
She left him a voice mail just after midnight last night.
Well, based on rigor, that is within my estimated TOD.
Did he say what the message was?
Yeah.
Bethany told Henry she was being followed, and she was going to e-mail him a file.
He never got it.
Okay, we got a monitor, keyboard, cables... no computer tower.
The killer could've taken it.
I wonder what she was working on.
I don't know what file
Bethany was talking about when she left the message, but I'm pretty sure it had something to do with Athis Logistics.
Who are they?
One of the largest shipping companies on Oahu.
Bethany blew the whistle on them last month for dumping benzene waste in the ocean just two miles off-shore.
They couldn't have been happy when that story came out.
The day it hit, company stock took a dive.
Lost $200 million in a day.
She started getting death threats.
Eight in the last three weeks.
Any of them sound legitimate?
The head of my security did forward me this voice mail from her office phone a couple of days ago.
Keep away from Athis.
You publish one more thing, you're a dead woman.
Sounds legit to me.
Keep away from Athis.
You publish one more thing, you're a dead woman.
It's a good soundalike, I'll give you that.
But it's not me.
Voice comparison says it is.
Well, Mr. Schulte, I'd take the word of a voice comparison over you.
Did someone at Athis tell you to kill Bethany Morris, or did you just make that call on the fly?
Was I paid to dig up some dirt on the reporter?
Maybe scare her a little?
Sure, I'll cop to that.
But I didn't kill anybody.
Are you...
I mean, how big of a moron are you?
Huh?
A woman turns up dead after you leave her a series of death threats.
Do you think that a jury's just going to ignore that?
What if I had something that could help you find who did this?
We're listening.
The other day, I followed Morris to Maui.
She spent a couple of hours there, and then flew back.
Well, what was she doing there?
I don't know.
She went to a small place up around Kapalua.
Didn't see who she met, but the person's mail was addressed to a Jane Woodley.
Couldn't find anything on her.
That's interesting.
It's not quite enough for a get out of jail free card, but...
I'm getting to it.
That night, I flew back.
Went to Morris's place in Chinatown and sat on it.
- All right, when was that?
- Last night.
Night Morris was murdered.
I saw a guy go in there five minutes before she did.
I thought he lived in the building, but then, 15 minutes later,
I see the guy chugging down the fire escape with something under his arm.
Computer tower?
Could've been.
- What did he look like?
- I don't know.
I tried taking a picture, but it was dark.
Did manage to get a partial plate before he took off.
What do you think?
Well, let's run the plates on the car.
Have Lori do it, and, uh, how do you feel about going to Maui?
Let's do it.
Good to see you back on the island, Jenna.
Your e-mail said it was important.
What's up?
I have a favor to ask you.
It's really big.
Is this about your fiancé?
Ever since I heard that Josh might be alive in Southeast Asia, I have been... pounding the pavement back in D.C.
After three months of analyzing classified intel and trading favors...
I found him.
Josh is alive.
Are you kidding me?
That's-that's great news, Jenna.
That's incredible.
Do you know where he is?
North Korea.
A, uh... a small rebel faction is holding Josh hostage near the border.
They got a hold of him after a CIA op went bad.
The one I messed up.
Okay.
Have you, um... have you taken this to the Agency?
Yeah.
They can't lift a finger.
They have to disavow any and all knowledge of his existence.
S.O.P. for this kind of job, behind enemy lines, covert op.
What do these rebels want?
They are willing to exchange Josh for $250,000, U.S. currency.
That's where I come in.
What, you can... you're thinking... wait a minute.
You're seriously considering going through with this?
If I don't, Josh is dead.
- Jenna...
- Do you understand?
I have no other options but to pay them.
Well... okay, have you got that kind of money?
I sold my parents' house in Virginia to get it.
It's all I have.
Where's this deal going down?
Their turf.
A small town about 20 miles south of Kaesong.
I can't go alone, Steve.
I need somebody there to watch my back.
I need you.
Yeah.
Yes, sir.
No, absolutely.
No, no, no.
Thank you, sir.
- What's up?
Any luck?
- No.
The Ranger unit that supported me in capturing
Anton Hesse in North Korea has been redeployed.
There's no way they can escort Jenna to the drop site.
Okay, listen.
I know you...
I know you want to put on the cape, and you want to go save the day, but please keep in mind, please, that this is not a puddle-jumper to Lana'i.
Okay?
This is North Korea.
I'm aware of that, thank you, Danny.
Okay.
What do you want to do?
What am I gonna do?
I got to help her.
I'd do the same for you, and anybody else here.
You know?
What am I gonna do?
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Please, just...
I'm just assuming, whatever it is you're about to do, you've done before, right?
Ah, it's classified.
Of course.
Do I... is that concern that I see?
Yeah, jerk.
I'm concerned.
Big deal.
I'll be fine, all right?
It's North Korea.
What could go wrong?
- Yeah, I know.
Hey.
- Hi.
Do me a favor and watch yourself, huh?
I'll think about you the whole time.
Thanks.
- Hmm.
What did I miss?
- Nothing.
He's, uh, got to go help a friend.
He'll be gone a couple days.
What's up?
You don't seem too happy about it.
- Is it something dangerous?
- No.
Guy's a Navy SEAL, right?
Everything's fine.
Nothing to worry about.
According to our suspect, your tenant, Jane Woodley, had a visitor a couple days ago.
Was this the woman?
Yeah, that's her.
Jane wasn't too happy about it, either.
Kimo, we need to find Jane.
Did she leave any forwarding information?
Maybe a credit card to hold the place?
I copied down her driver's license for the file.
Here it is.
That's Jenna Kaye.
And this woman was here for how long?
Three months at least.
Could you excuse us one minute?
Okay, what the hell?
Wasn't Jenna supposed to be in D.C. these last three months?
Yeah, McGarrett said that she was trying to find her fiancé.
Apparently, she's not trying very hard.
Well, if she lied to McGarrett about that, then what else is she lying about?
Listen to me, Jenna.
We don't give these guys any money until we get a positive I.D. on Josh, okay?
♪ ♪
- Josh.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, just wait.
Just wait.
No guns.
Bring money.
You bring guns, we shoot.
Damn it, listen to me.
Listen to me.
That is not your fiancé.
That man is 5'9".
He's got tan skin.
He's a healthy 185 pounds.
Okay?
It's not Josh.
- Let me go, Steve.
- Not going to let you go.
We got to move.
We got to go the other way right now.
I'm sorry.
How long's she been working for you?
Hmm?
That story she sold me about her fiancé-- is it true?
Huh?
I just tried Steve's satellite phone 20 times in the last hour.
No answer.
The area they're in is all deep forest.
It may have blocked the signal.
No, something is wrong.
Something is wrong.
Otherwise, why would Jenna lie to us?
My question is, did Jenna have anything to do with Bethany Morris's murder?
Hey.
- Any word from Steve?
- No, nothing.
Okay, look, there's got to be a number of logical explanations as to why he's not answering.
There's nothing logical about this.
Okay?
We just found out that someone we worked with-- someone that we trusted-- has been lying to us for months and now might have something to do with our murder.
The only way we're going to get answers to any of this is by finding Bethany Morris's killer.
Lori, did you get anything on the suspect
Schulte said he saw scrambling out of Bethany's place?
Yeah, I got a hit off his partial plate.
It was a rental booked under the name Sung Paek.
DL's a fake, so I ran the name against hotel registries across the island-
- I got a match.
Kail Inn.
Gun!
Clear.
Took himself out rather than get caught.
Why?
Desperation?
Fear?
Fear of what?
Prison?
What might happen to him if he talked to us.
Guys, I think I got Bethany Morris's computer.
Looks like our guy was trying to hack into it.
What the hell is that thing?
It's a hard drive recovery system.
It's used for extracting encrypted data.
It's a virus.
Uh, Paek must have initiated it right before we breached.
- Can you stop it?
- No.
There might be a way to recover what's left, though.
You think you salvaged anything?
Yeah.
I managed to recover a bunch of scattered data, including a couple pages from Bethany Morris's latest article, something called "Lost Prisoner of Fate."
What's it about?
Well, from what I could make out, it's, uh, about something called Operation Switchback.
That sounds like a military op.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Look at this.
It's part of an e-mail about a classified CIA file that looks like it's been 95% redacted.
Jenna was CIA.
Maybe that's why Bethany went to see her.
I checked in with Langley-- they have no official record of an op with that name.
- No, they're lying.
- Of course they're lying, but the interesting thing was, when I asked them about it, they transferred me to a number in North Carolina.

Which means Switchback was a joint
CIA-Special Forces operation, so no way we're going to get intel on that.
Want to bet?
You do realize those are one-by-twos, right, Wade?

Yeah.
Those are for supporting the windows, not for cross bracing.
Are you implying I don't know how to build a boar blind?
No, I'm not implying it;
I'm saying it.
Hey, Joe!
Would it kill you to stay in cell phone range?
Hey, what are you doing out here?
Listen, Joe, I need to know everything about a CIA-Special Forces joint operation called Switchback.
Uh, even if it rang a bell, I couldn't disclose anything about it.
What's so important about this op?
I have no idea, but a woman was murdered over it, and someone we used to work with might be involved now-- Jenna Kaye.
Well, why don't you ask her about it?
Yeah, I would, but, uh, I can't because she's with Steve in North Korea.
What?

No, Jenna, I can't hear you.
Where's Steve?
Jenna, say it again.

The governor has to do something.
I don't know.
Steve went into North Korea on a completely unsanctioned personal mission.
He thought he was helping a friend.
Some friend.
- Any word?
- No, we're still waiting to hear if Danny can get the governor to help us.
You make any headway with the military?
Not in terms of rescuing Steve, but I did get some interesting intel about Operation Switchback that could help us.
What'd you find out?
It was a CIA op into North Korea that went bad, resulted in the capture of one Officer Joshua Hirsch.
That was Kaye's fiancé.
She took a leave from Five-O thinking he could be alive.
Seems a reporter named Bethany Morris was asking all about Operation Switchback, specifically about Officer Hirsch.
Why?
She claimed she had a source in South Korea that said he was alive.
And since Jenna Kaye was listed as the intel officer for the op...
Bethany Morris went to see her to ask her about it.
Okay, so how does this help us?
Because the unredacted Switchback file details the location of a bunker just south of Kaesong, and it's suspected to be a cache for Wo Fat.
Okay, Kaesong-- isn't that where
Kaye said she was when they got cut off?
Yeah.
Um, well, we can forget it, because even if the governor appealed to the State Department about launching a diplomatic mission, something like that could take weeks, maybe even months, to get approved.
We don't have that kind of time.
Something needs to get done right now or Steve's as good as dead.
That's right.
So what do we do?
We're going to bring Steve home.
Joe, what's with the medical supplies?
Can't go on a humanitarian mission to inoculate villagers in South Korea without the proper supplies.
- Ah.
Humanitarian mission.
Right.
It was either that or say that we were a band heading over there to entertain the troops.
So unless you play a mean bass...
So what happens when we hit the ground in Seoul?
We're on our own.
I'm going to need your badges and I.D.'s.
The minute this plane leaves the ground, we're just civilians.
That means no military supplies, fire support or friendlies in the area.
If the mission is compromised, we go on escape and evade.
And in the unlikely event that we pull this off, we could be charged with espionage, face federal prosecution and prison time for what we are about to do.
That is, of course, if any of us make it back.
So if anyone wants to back out, now is the time.
No shame in it.
Go with God and wish us luck.
All right, that settles it, then.
We come back with Steve, or we don't come back.
All right, who's ready to kick ass and take names?
Got room for a few members of SEAL Team 9 on this little, uh... what are you calling it?
Humanitarian mission.
Right.
That's what I thought.
Load it up, ladies.
Okay, uh, I thought we weren't gonna have any military backup.
Yeah, I mean, won't you guys get in serious trouble for this?
Well, technically, uh, Team 9 had a few days of R R coming, so we decided to do some sightseeing in Seoul.
Last I checked, we owe Commander McGarrett and Five-O a favor.
About a little midair rescue, as I recall.
Welcome aboard.
Why?
I had no choice.
We let you in.
We treated you as one of our own.
I trusted you.
I came down here, I didn't ask one question.
Wo Fat told me Josh was alive.
You just took him for his word?
He showed me his ring.
He had pictures.
But more than anything,
I needed to believe it.
I would have done anything to save him.
So you decided to trade him for me.
Yes.
So where is he, Kaye?
Huh?
You have to understand... this reporter came to me looking into Josh's operation.
She said she had a source that said that Josh was alive.
And I thought, if anyone could survive...
He's a lot like you.
A fighter, you know?
There was this one night... we were supposed to have dinner in D.C.
The Capitol Grille.
It was raining, and he was late, and his car wouldn't start, so he hops on his bike of all things.
Got in this horrible accident.
Got hit by a car.
Had to have these pins put in his knee.
And when I reached the hospital,
I just lit into him.
He's always rushing around like that for nothing.
That's when he pulled out the ring and he said,
"It wasn't for nothing."
The reporter who came to you... was her name Bethany Morris?
How did you know?
She's dead.
She had her neck snapped.
Did you know that?
No.
You don't get it, do you, Kaye?
Wo Fat was her source.
He sent... he sent Morris straight to you to give you hope that Josh was still alive.
And my hope got her killed.
All right, me and Joe have been studying the Switchback op.
Based on JSOC intel and the latest thermal imaging of the area where the team was taken, satellites have detected a flurry of recent activity around this old Korean War bunker.
Activity in an area where there shouldn't be any activity, and border crossings where there shouldn't be border crossings.
All on foot, all in the last 24 hours.
You think it's Wo Fat's people?
Bet my life on it.
Thing is, there's no roads in.
The quickest way to this compound's by helo.

Yeah, I'll be right there.
Victim's name is Bethany Morris.
She was a reporter for the Pacific Register.
What happened?
Based on the abraded injuries and splinters in her hands, it would seem that the victim was hiding before she was dragged out from under her bed.
So that's when her neck was broken.
Correct.
It's very sad.
Yes.
Besides that, we have no prints, no signs of forced entry.
Perp was in and out, very clean, very quick.
So I just got off the phone with a Henry Dobson, Bethany's editor.
She left him a voice mail just after midnight last night.
Well, based on rigor, that is within my estimated TOD.
Did he say what the message was?
Yeah.
Bethany told Henry she was being followed, and she was going to e-mail him a file.
He never got it.
Okay, we got a monitor, keyboard, cables... no computer tower.
The killer could've taken it.
I wonder what she was working on.
I don't know what file
Bethany was talking about when she left the message, but I'm pretty sure it had something to do with Athis Logistics.
Who are they?
One of the largest shipping companies on Oahu.
Bethany blew the whistle on them last month for dumping benzene waste in the ocean just two miles off-shore.
They couldn't have been happy when that story came out.
The day it hit, company stock took a dive.
Lost $200 million in a day.
She started getting death threats.
Eight in the last three weeks.
Any of them sound legitimate?
The head of my security did forward me this voice mail from her office phone a couple of days ago.
Keep away from Athis.
You publish one more thing, you're a dead woman.
Sounds legit to me.
Keep away from Athis.
You publish one more thing, you're a dead woman.
It's a good soundalike, I'll give you that.
But it's not me.
Voice comparison says it is.
Well, Mr. Schulte, I'd take the word of a voice comparison over you.
Did someone at Athis tell you to kill Bethany Morris, or did you just make that call on the fly?
Was I paid to dig up some dirt on the reporter?
Maybe scare her a little?
Sure, I'll cop to that.
But I didn't kill anybody.
Are you...
I mean, how big of a moron are you?
Huh?
A woman turns up dead after you leave her a series of death threats.
Do you think that a jury's just going to ignore that?
What if I had something that could help you find who did this?
We're listening.
The other day, I followed Morris to Maui.
She spent a couple of hours there, and then flew back.
Well, what was she doing there?
I don't know.
She went to a small place up around Kapalua.
Didn't see who she met, but the person's mail was addressed to a Jane Woodley.
Couldn't find anything on her.
That's interesting.
It's not quite enough for a get out of jail free card, but...
I'm getting to it.
That night, I flew back.
Went to Morris's place in Chinatown and sat on it.
- All right, when was that?
- Last night.
Night Morris was murdered.
I saw a guy go in there five minutes before she did.
I thought he lived in the building, but then, 15 minutes later,
I see the guy chugging down the fire escape with something under his arm.
Computer tower?
Could've been.
- What did he look like?

Ever since I heard that Josh might be alive in Southeast Asia, I have been... pounding the pavement back in D.C.
After three months of analyzing classified intel and trading favors...
I found him.
Josh is alive.
Are you kidding me?
That's-that's great news, Jenna.
That's incredible.
Do you know where he is?
North Korea.
A, uh... a small rebel faction is holding Josh hostage near the border.
They got a hold of him after a CIA op went bad.
The one I messed up.
Okay.
Have you, um... have you taken this to the Agency?
Yeah.
They can't lift a finger.
They have to disavow any and all knowledge of his existence.
S.O.P. for this kind of job, behind enemy lines, covert op.
What do these rebels want?
They are willing to exchange Josh for $250,000, U.S. currency.
That's where I come in.

Uh, Paek must have initiated it right before we breached.

You think you salvaged anything?
Yeah.
I managed to recover a bunch of scattered data, including a couple pages from Bethany Morris's latest article, something called "Lost Prisoner of Fate."
What's it about?
Well, from what I could make out, it's, uh, about something called Operation Switchback.
That sounds like a military op.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Look at this.
It's part of an e-mail about a classified CIA file that looks like it's been 95% redacted.
Jenna was CIA.
Maybe that's why Bethany went to see her.
I checked in with Langley-- they have no official record of an op with that name.
- No, they're lying.
- Of course they're lying, but the interesting thing was, when I asked them about it, they transferred me to a number in North Carolina.

He showed me his ring.
He had pictures.
But more than anything,
I needed to believe it.
I would have done anything to save him.
So you decided to trade him for me.
Yes.
So where is he, Kaye?
Huh?
You have to understand... this reporter came to me looking into Josh's operation.
She said she had a source that said that Josh was alive.
And I thought, if anyone could survive...
He's a lot like you.
A fighter, you know?
There was this one night... we were supposed to have dinner in D.C.
The Capitol Grille.
It was raining, and he was late, and his car wouldn't start, so he hops on his bike of all things.
Got in this horrible accident.
Got hit by a car.
Had to have these pins put in his knee.
And when I reached the hospital,
I just lit into him.
He's always rushing around like that for nothing.
That's when he pulled out the ring and he said,
"It wasn't for nothing."
The reporter who came to you... was her name Bethany Morris?
How did you know?
She's dead.
She had her neck snapped.
Did you know that?
No.
You don't get it, do you, Kaye?
Wo Fat was her source.
He sent... he sent Morris straight to you to give you hope that Josh was still alive.
And my hope got her killed.
All right, me and Joe have been studying the Switchback op.
Based on JSOC intel and the latest thermal imaging of the area where the team was taken, satellites have detected a flurry of recent activity around this old Korean War bunker.
Activity in an area where there shouldn't be any activity, and border crossings where there shouldn't be border crossings.
All on foot, all in the last 24 hours.
You think it's Wo Fat's people?
Bet my life on it.
Thing is, there's no roads in.
The quickest way to this compound's by helo.
Anyone know where we can find one of those?
Yeah, along with a few automatic weapons?
I know a guy.

Victim's name is Bethany Morris.
She was a reporter for the Pacific Register.
What happened?
Based on the abraded injuries and splinters in her hands, it would seem that the victim was hiding before she was dragged out from under her bed.
So that's when her neck was broken.
MAX:
Correct.
It's very sad.
Yes.
Besides that, we have no prints, no signs of forced entry.
Perp was in and out, very clean, very quick.
CHIN:
So I just got off the phone with a Henry Dobson, Bethany's editor.
She left him a voice mail just after midnight last night.
Well, based on rigor, that is within my estimated TOD.
Did he say what the message was?
Yeah.
Bethany told Henry she was being followed, and she was going to e-mail him a file.
He never got it.
Okay, we got a monitor, keyboard, cables... no computer tower.
The killer could've taken it.
I wonder what she was working on.
HENRY:
I don't know what file
Bethany was talking about when she left the message, but I'm pretty sure it had something to do with Athis Logistics.
Who are they?
One of the largest shipping companies on Oahu.
Bethany blew the whistle on them last month for dumping benzene waste in the ocean just two miles off-shore.
They couldn't have been happy when that story came out.
The day it hit, company stock took a dive.
Lost $200 million in a day.
She started getting death threats.
Eight in the last three weeks.
Any of them sound legitimate?
The head of my security did forward me this voice mail from her office phone a couple of days ago.
MAN'S VOICE:
Keep away from Athis.
You publish one more thing, you're a dead woman.
Sounds legit to me.
MAN'S VOICE:
Keep away from Athis.
You publish one more thing, you're a dead woman.
It's a good soundalike, I'll give you that.
But it's not me.
Voice comparison says it is.
DANNY:
Well, Mr. Schulte, I'd take the word of a voice comparison over you.
Did someone at Athis tell you to kill Bethany Morris, or did you just make that call on the fly?
Was I paid to dig up some dirt on the reporter?
Maybe scare her a little?
Sure, I'll cop to that.
But I didn't kill anybody.
Are you...
I mean, how big of a moron are you?
Huh?
A woman turns up dead after you leave her a series of death threats.
Do you think that a jury's just going to ignore that?
What if I had something that could help you find who did this?
We're listening.
The other day, I followed Morris to Maui.
She spent a couple of hours there, and then flew back.
Well, what was she doing there?
I don't know.
She went to a small place up around Kapalua.
Didn't see who she met, but the person's mail was addressed to a Jane Woodley.
Couldn't find anything on her.
That's interesting.
It's not quite enough for a get out of jail free card, but...
I'm getting to it.
That night, I flew back.
Went to Morris's place in Chinatown and sat on it.
- All right, when was that?
- Last night.
Night Morris was murdered.
I saw a guy go in there five minutes before she did.
I thought he lived in the building, but then, 15 minutes later,
I see the guy chugging down the fire escape with something under his arm.
CHIN:
Computer tower?
Could've been.

It's really big.
Is this about your fiancé?
Ever since I heard that Josh might be alive in Southeast Asia, I have been... pounding the pavement back in D.C.
After three months of analyzing classified intel and trading favors...
I found him.
Josh is alive.
Are you kidding me?
That's-that's great news, Jenna.
That's incredible.
Do you know where he is?
North Korea.
A, uh... a small rebel faction is holding Josh hostage near the border.
They got a hold of him after a CIA op went bad.
The one I messed up.
Okay.
Have you, um... have you taken this to the Agency?
Yeah.
They can't lift a finger.
They have to disavow any and all knowledge of his existence.
S.O.P. for this kind of job, behind enemy lines, covert op.
What do these rebels want?
They are willing to exchange Josh for $250,000, U.S. currency.
That's where I come in.
What, you can... you're thinking... wait a minute.
You're seriously considering going through with this?
If I don't, Josh is dead.

- Do you understand?
I have no other options but to pay them.
Well... okay, have you got that kind of money?
I sold my parents' house in Virginia to get it.
It's all I have.
Where's this deal going down?
Their turf.

Uh, Paek must have initiated it right before we breached.
LORI:

- No.
There might be a way to recover what's left, though.
DANNY:
You think you salvaged anything?
KONO:
Yeah.
I managed to recover a bunch of scattered data, including a couple pages from Bethany Morris's latest article, something called "Lost Prisoner of Fate."
CHIN:
What's it about?
Well, from what I could make out, it's, uh, about something called Operation Switchback.
That sounds like a military op.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Look at this.
It's part of an e-mail about a classified CIA file that looks like it's been 95% redacted.
CHIN:
Jenna was CIA.
Maybe that's why Bethany went to see her.
I checked in with Langley-- they have no official record of an op with that name.
- No, they're lying.
- Of course they're lying, but the interesting thing was, when I asked them about it, they transferred me to a number in North Carolina.
JSOC headquarters.
Which means Switchback was a joint
CIA-Special Forces operation, so no way we're going to get intel on that.
Want to bet?
You do realize those are one-by-twos, right, Wade?
I can measure.
Yeah.
Those are for supporting the windows, not for cross bracing.

Hey, what are you doing out here?
Listen, Joe, I need to know everything about a CIA-Special Forces joint operation called Switchback.

(door opens)
- Any word?
- No, we're still waiting to hear if Danny can get the governor to help us.
You make any headway with the military?
Not in terms of rescuing Steve, but I did get some interesting intel about Operation Switchback that could help us.
What'd you find out?
It was a CIA op into North Korea that went bad, resulted in the capture of one Officer Joshua Hirsch.
That was Kaye's fiancé.
CHIN:
She took a leave from Five-O thinking he could be alive.
Seems a reporter named Bethany Morris was asking all about Operation Switchback, specifically about Officer Hirsch.
KONO:
Why?
She claimed she had a source in South Korea that said he was alive.
And since Jenna Kaye was listed as the intel officer for the op...
CHIN:
Bethany Morris went to see her to ask her about it.
Okay, so how does this help us?
Because the unredacted Switchback file details the location of a bunker just south of Kaesong, and it's suspected to be a cache for Wo Fat.
LORI:
Okay, Kaesong-- isn't that where
Kaye said she was when they got cut off?
Yeah.
Um, well, we can forget it, because even if the governor appealed to the State Department about launching a diplomatic mission, something like that could take weeks, maybe even months, to get approved.
We don't have that kind of time.
Something needs to get done right now or Steve's as good as dead.
That's right.
So what do we do?
We're going to bring Steve home.
Joe, what's with the medical supplies?
Can't go on a humanitarian mission to inoculate villagers in South Korea without the proper supplies.
- Ah.
Humanitarian mission.
Right.
It was either that or say that we were a band heading over there to entertain the troops.
So unless you play a mean bass...
So what happens when we hit the ground in Seoul?
We're on our own.
I'm going to need your badges and I.D.'s.
The minute this plane leaves the ground, we're just civilians.
That means no military supplies, fire support or friendlies in the area.
If the mission is compromised, we go on escape and evade.
And in the unlikely event that we pull this off, we could be charged with espionage, face federal prosecution and prison time for what we are about to do.
That is, of course, if any of us make it back.
So if anyone wants to back out, now is the time.
No shame in it.
Go with God and wish us luck.
All right, that settles it, then.
We come back with Steve, or we don't come back.

What are you doing?
I'm fixing a mistake.
[GASPS]
This should have been on your finger a long time ago.
Chin Ho Kelly,
I would like nothing more than to be your wife.
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
MALIA:
Are you gonna get that?
CHIN:
Get what?
[MALIA LAUGHS]
CHIN:
Kelly.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Victim's name is Bethany Morris.
She was a reporter for The Pacific Register.
What happened?
Based on the abraded injuries and splinters in her hands, it would seem that the victim was hiding before she was dragged out from under her bed.
- So that's when her neck was broken?
MAX:
Correct.
It's very sad.
Yes, besides that, we have no prints, no signs of forced entry.
Perp was in and out, very clean, very quick.
I just got off the phone with a Henry Dobson, Bethany's editor.
She left him a voicemail just after midnight last night.
Based on rigor, that is within my estimated TOD.
Did he say what the message was?
Yeah, Bethany told Henry she was being followed, and she was gonna e-mail him a file.
He never got it.
Okay, we got a monitor, keyboard, cables.
No computer tower.
Killer could've taken that.
I wonder what she was working on.
I don't know what file Bethany was talking about in her message, but I'm pretty sure it had something to do with Athis Logistics.
- Who are they?
- A large shipping company on O'ahu.
Bethany blew the whistle on them last month for dumping benzene waste in the ocean just two miles offshore.
They couldn't have been happy when that story came out.
The day it hit, company stock took a dive, lost 200 million in a day.
She started getting death threats.
Eight in the last three weeks.
Any of them sound legitimate?
The head of my security did forward me this voicemail from her office phone a couple of days ago.
MAN [ON RECORDING]:
Keep away from Athis.
You publish one more thing, you're a dead woman.
Sounds legit to me.
MAN [ON RECORDING]:
Keep away from Athis.
You publish one more thing, you're a dead woman.
It's a good soundalike, I'll give you that.
But it's not me.
Voice comparison says it is.
Well, Mr. Schulte, I'd take the word of the voice comparison over you.
Someone at Athis tell you to kill Bethany Morris, or did you just make that call on the fly?
Was I paid to dig up some dirt on the reporter?
Maybe scare her a little?
Sure, I'll cop to that.
But I didn't kill anybody.
Are you...?
I mean, how big of a moron are you?
A woman turns up dead after you leave her a series of death threats.
Do you think that a jury is just going to ignore that?
What if I had something that could help you find who did this?
We're listening.
The other day, I followed Morris to Maui.
She spent a couple of hours there, and then flew back.
What was she doing there?
I don't know.
But she went to a small place up around Kapalua.
Didn't see who she met, but the person's mail was addressed to a Jane Woodley.
Couldn't find anything on her.
It's not quite enough for a "get outta jail free" card, but...
I'm getting to it.
That night I flew back, went to Morris' place in Chinatown and sat on her.
- All right, when was that?
- Last night, night she was murdered.
I saw a guy go in there five minutes before she did.
I thought he lived in the building, but then 15 minutes later,
I see the guy chugging down the fire escape with something under his arm.
- Computer tower?
- Could've been.
- What did he look like?
SCHULTE:
Don't know.
I tried taking a picture, but it was dark.
Did manage to get a partial plate before he took off.
What do you think?
Let's run plates on the car, have Lori do it.
And how do you feel about going to Maui?
Let's do it.
McGARRETT:
Good to see you back on the island, Jenna.
Your e-mail said it was important.
What's up?
I have a favor to ask you.
It's really big.
Is this about your fiancé?
Ever since I heard that Josh might be alive in Southeast Asia,
I've been pounding the pavement back in D.C.
After three months of analyzing classified intel and trading favors,
I found him.
Josh is alive.
Are you kidding me?
That's great news, Jenna.
That's incredible.
Do you know where he is?
North Korea.
A small rebel faction is holding Josh hostage near the border.
They got ahold of him after his CIA op went bad.
The one I messed up.
Okay.
Have you taken this to the agency?
Yeah.
They can't lift a finger.
They have to disavow any and all knowledge of his existence.
SOP for this kind of job, behind enemy lines, covert op.
What do these rebels want?
They are willing to exchange Josh for 250,000, U.S. Currency.
That's where I come in.
You're...
Hey, wait a minute.
You're seriously considering going through with this?
If I don't, Josh is dead.
- Jenna...
- Do you understand?
I have no other options but to pay them.
Okay, have you got that kind of money?
I sold my parents' house in Virginia to get it.
It's all I have.
Where's this deal going down?
Their turf.
Small town about 20 miles south of Kaesong.
I can't go alone, Steve.
I need somebody there to watch my back.
I need you.
McGARRETT:
Yes, sir.
No, absolutely.
No, no, no.
Thank you, sir.
What's up?
Any luck?
No.
The Ranger unit that supported me in capturing Anton Hesse in North Korea has been redeployed.
There's no way that they could escort Jenna to the drop site.
[SIGHS]
Okay, listen.
I know you wanna put on the cape, and you wanna go save the day, but please keep in mind that this is not a puddle jumper to Lanai.
Okay?
This is North Korea.
I'm aware of that.
Thank you, Danny.
Okay.
- What do you wanna do?
- What am I gonna do?
I gotta help her.
I'd do the same for you, anybody else here.
You know?
What am I gonna do?
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm just assuming whatever it is you're about to do, you've done before, right?
Ah, it's classified.
Of course.
Is that concern that I see?
Yeah, jerk.
I'm concerned, big deal.
I'll be fine.
All right?
It's North Korea.
What could go wrong?
- Hey.
- Hey.
Do me a favor, watch yourself?
- I'll think about you the whole time.
- Thanks.
- Hmm.
What did I miss?
- Nothing.
He's gonna go help a friend, he'll be gone a couple days.
What's up?
You don't seem too happy about it.
Is it something dangerous?
No, guy's a Navy SEAL, right?
Everything's fine.
Nothing to worry about.
CHIN:
Our suspect said your tenant, Jane Woodley, had a visitor.
Was this the woman?
KIMO:
Yeah, that's her.
Jane wasn't too happy about it, either.
Kimo, we need to find Jane.
Did she leave any forwarding information?
Maybe a credit card to hold the place?
I copied down her driver's license for the file.
Here it is.
That's Jenna Kaye.
And this woman was here for how long?
Three months at least.
Could you excuse us one minute?
Okay, what the hell?
Wasn't Jenna in D.C. These last three months?
Yeah, McGarrett said she was trying to find her fiancé.
Apparently she's not trying very hard.
If she lied about that, what else is she lying about?
Listen to me, Jenna.
We don't give these guys any money till we have a positive ID on Josh, okay?
Josh.
Just wait.
Just wait.
[SPEAKS IN KOREAN]
No guns.

[THUDS]
[GROANS]
[GRUNTS]
[SPEAKING IN KOREAN]
[IN ENGLISH] How long has she been working for you?
That story she told me about her fiancé, is it true?
Huh?
Just tried Steve's satellite phone 20 times in the last hour.
No answer.
The area they're in is all deep forest.
It may have blocked the signal.
No, something is wrong.
Otherwise, why would Jenna lie to us?
Question is, did Jenna have anything to do with Bethany Morris' murder?
- Hey, any word from Steve?
- No, nothing.
Okay, look, there's gotta be a number of logical explanations as to why he's not answering.
No, there's nothing logical about this.
We just found out that someone we worked with, someone that we trusted, has been lying to us for months, and now might have something to do with our murder.
The only way we're gonna get answers to any of this is by finding Bethany Morris' killer.
Did you get anything on the suspect Schulte saw leaving Bethany's place?
I got a hit off his partial plate, a rental booked under the name Sung Paek.
The DL's a fake.
So I checked hotel registries across the island and got a match.
Kailua Inn.
[POLICE SIRENS BLARING]
LORI:
Gun!
Took himself out rather than get caught.
Why?
Desperation?
Fear?
Fear of what?
Prison?
LORI:
What might happen if he talked to us?
Guys, I think I got Bethany Morris' computer.
He was trying to hack into it.
- What is that thing?
- It's a hard drive recovery system.
It's used for extracting encrypted data.
Hold on.
It's a virus.
Paek must've initiated it right before we breached.
LORI:
Can you stop it?
KONO:
No.
There might be a way to recover what's left, though.
DANNY:
Now you think you salvaged anything?
KONO:
Yeah, I managed to recover a bunch of scattered data, including a couple of pages from Bethany Morris' latest article, something called "Lost Prisoner of Fate."
CHIN:
What's it about?
From what I could make out, it's about something called Operation Switchback.
That sounds like a military op.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Look at this.
It's part of an e-mail about a classified CIA file that looks like it's been 95% redacted.
CHIN:
Jenna was CIA?
Maybe that's why Bethany went to see her.
Langley has no official record of an op with that name.
- No, no.
They're lying.
- Of course they're lying.
But the interesting thing was when I asked them about it, they transferred me to a number in North Carolina, JSOC headquarters, which means Switchback was a joint CIA-Special Forces operation.
No way we're gonna get intel on that.
Wanna bet?
You do realize those are one-by-twos, right, Wade?
I can measure, yeah.
Those are for supporting the windows, not for cross bracing.
Are you implying I don't know how to build a boar blind?
No, I'm not implying it.
I'm saying it.
Hey, Joe, would it kill you to stay in cell phone range?
Hey, why are you out here?
Listen, Joe, I need to know everything about a CIA-Special Forces joint operation called Switchback.
Even if it rang a bell, I couldn't disclose anything about it.
JOE:
What's so important about this op?
I have no idea, but a woman was murdered over it.
Someone we used to work with might be involved now.
Jenna Kaye.
Why don't you ask her about it?
Yeah, I would, but I can't because she's with Steve in North Korea.
What?
I think he's in trouble, Joe.

LORI:
The governor has to do something.
CHIN:
I don't know.
Steve went into North Korea on a completely unsanctioned, personal mission.
- He thought he was helping a friend.
- Some friend.
Any word?
We're still waiting to hear if the governor can help us.
- You get anywhere with the military?
- Not in terms of rescuing Steve.
But I got some intel about Operation Switchback that could help us.
- What'd you find out?
JOE:
It was a CIA op into North Korea that went bad, resulted in the capture of one Officer Joshua Hirsch.
That was Kaye's fiancé.
Yeah, she took a leave from Five-0 thinking he could be alive.
Seems a reporter named Bethany Morris was asking all about Operation Switchback,
- specifically about Officer Hirsch.
KONO:
Why?
She claimed she had a source in South Korea that said he was alive.
And since Jenna Kaye was listed as the intel officer for the op...
Bethany Morris went to see her to ask her about it.
So how does this help us?
Because the unredacted Switchback file details the location of a bunker just south of Kaesong.
And it's suspected to be a cache for Wo Fat.
Kaesong, isn't that where Kaye said she was when they got cut off?
Yeah.
Um, well, we can forget it because even if the governor appealed to the state department about launching a diplomatic mission, something like that could take weeks, maybe even months to get approved.
We don't have that much time.
We have to act now, or Steve's as good as dead.
That's right.
So?
What do we do?
We're gonna bring Steve home.
Joe, what's with the medical supplies?
JOE:
Can't go on a humanitarian mission to inoculate villagers without the proper supplies.
Ah, humanitarian mission.
Right.
It was either that, or say we were a band going to entertain the troops.
So unless you play a mean bass...
So what happens when we hit the ground in Seoul?
We're on our own.
I'm gonna need your badges and IDs.
The minute this plane leaves the ground, we're just civilians.
That means no military supplies, fire support, or friendlies in the area.
If the mission is compromised, we go on escape and evade.
And in the unlikely event that we pull this off, we could be charged with espionage, face federal prosecution, and prison time for what we are about to do.
That is, of course, if any of us make it back.
So if anyone wants to back out, now is the time.
No shame in it.
Go with God and wish us luck.
All right, that settles it, then.
We come back with Steve, or we don't come back.
All right, who's ready to kick ass and take names?
Got room for a few members of SEAL Team Nine on this little, uh, what are you calling it?
Humanitarian mission.
Right, that's what I thought.
Load it up, ladies.
Uh, I thought we weren't gonna have any military back-up.
Won't you get in serious trouble for this?
Well, technically, Team Nine had a few days' R and R coming, so we decided to do some sightseeing in Seoul.
Last I checked, we owed Commander McGarrett and Five-0 a favor.
Something about a little mid-air rescue, as I recall.
Welcome aboard.
[GRUNTING]
Why?
I had no choice.
We let you in.
We treated you as one of our own.
We trusted you.
I came down here.
I didn't ask one question.
Wo Fat told me Josh was alive.
You just took him for his word?
He showed me his ring.
He had pictures, but more than anything, I needed to believe it.
I would've done anything to save him.
So you decided to trade him for me.
Yes.
So where is he, Kaye?
You have to understand.
This reporter came to me looking into Josh's operation.
She said she had a source that said that Josh was alive.
And I thought if anyone could survive...
He's a lot like you.
A fighter, you know?
There was this one night we were supposed to have dinner in D.C.,
The Capital Grille.
And it was raining, and he was late, and his car wouldn't start.
So he hops on his bike of all things.
Got in this horrible accident.
Got hit by a car.
Had to have these pins put in his knee.
And when I reached the hospital, I just lit into him.
He's always rushing around like that for nothing.
That's when he pulled out the ring, and he said, "It wasn't for nothing."
The reporter who came to you, was her name Bethany Morris?
How did you know?
She's dead.
She had her neck snapped.
Did you know that?
No.
You don't you get it, do you, Kaye?
Wo Fat was her source.
You see?
He sent Morris straight to you to give you hope that Josh was still alive.
And my hope got her killed.
All right, me and Joe have been studying this Switchback op.
Based on JSOC intel and the latest thermal imaging of the area where the team was taken, satellites have detected a flurry of recent activity around this old Korean War bunker.
Activity in an area where there shouldn't be any activity.
And border crossings where there shouldn't be border crossings.
All on foot, all in the last 24 hours.
You think it's Wo Fat's people?
Bet my life on it.
Thing is, there's no roads in.
Quickest way to this compound's by helo.
Anyone know where we can find one of those?
Yeah, along with a few automatic weapons?
I know a guy.
What guy?
As I live and drink.
Funky Joe White?
It's good to see you, Frank.
FRANK:

I would ask how you're doing, Frank, but I see you haven't moved in 15 years.
Hell, what brings you to this neck of the forest?
Business, unfortunately.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to collect on our debt.
Come on, 14 years?
Gotta be some kind of statute of limitations on that.
No.
I'm gonna need Tangerine and a couple of extra party favors.
What for?
I got a man in trouble, two towns over.
"Two towns over," as in, "over the border over"?
Yeah.

This is Tangerine?
Don't knock it till you fly it.

MALIA:
I don't think there's anything sexier than a man who can steal me away from work, and can cook.
Try it.
Mmm.
Oh, hold on.
You got a little something.
Oh...
What... what are you doing?
I'm fixing a mistake.
(gasps)
This should have been on your finger a long time ago.
Chin Ho Kelly,
I would like nothing more than to be your wife.
(sighs)
(cell phone rings)
Mmm... are you going to get that?
Get what?
(laughs)
(cell phone ringing)
Kelly.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Victim's name is Bethany Morris.
She was a reporter for the Pacific Register.
What happened?
Based on the abraded injuries and splinters in her hands, it would seem that the victim was hiding before she was dragged out from under her bed.
So that's when her neck was broken.
MAX:
Correct.
It's very sad.
Yes.
Besides that, we have no prints, no signs of forced entry.
Perp was in and out, very clean, very quick.
CHIN:
So I just got off the phone with a Henry Dobson, Bethany's editor.
She left him a voice mail just after midnight last night.
Well, based on rigor, that is within my estimated TOD.
Did he say what the message was?
Yeah.
Bethany told Henry she was being followed, and she was going to e-mail him a file.
He never got it.
Okay, we got a monitor, keyboard, cables... no computer tower.
The killer could've taken it.
I wonder what she was working on.
HENRY:
I don't know what file
Bethany was talking about when she left the message, but I'm pretty sure it had something to do with Athis Logistics.
Who are they?
One of the largest shipping companies on Oahu.
Bethany blew the whistle on them last month for dumping benzene waste in the ocean just two miles off-shore.
They couldn't have been happy when that story came out.
The day it hit, company stock took a dive.
Lost $200 million in a day.
She started getting death threats.
Eight in the last three weeks.
Any of them sound legitimate?
The head of my security did forward me this voice mail from her office phone a couple of days ago.
MAN'S VOICE:
Keep away from Athis.
You publish one more thing, you're a dead woman.
Sounds legit to me.
MAN'S VOICE:
Keep away from Athis.
You publish one more thing, you're a dead woman.
It's a good soundalike, I'll give you that.
But it's not me.
Voice comparison says it is.
DANNY:
Well, Mr. Schulte, I'd take the word of a voice comparison over you.
Did someone at Athis tell you to kill Bethany Morris, or did you just make that call on the fly?
Was I paid to dig up some dirt on the reporter?
Maybe scare her a little?
Sure, I'll cop to that.
But I didn't kill anybody.
Are you...
I mean, how big of a moron are you?
Huh?
A woman turns up dead after you leave her a series of death threats.
Do you think that a jury's just going to ignore that?
What if I had something that could help you find who did this?
We're listening.
The other day, I followed Morris to Maui.
She spent a couple of hours there, and then flew back.
Well, what was she doing there?
I don't know.
She went to a small place up around Kapalua.
Didn't see who she met, but the person's mail was addressed to a Jane Woodley.
Couldn't find anything on her.
That's interesting.
It's not quite enough for a get out of jail free card, but...
I'm getting to it.
That night, I flew back.
Went to Morris's place in Chinatown and sat on it.
- All right, when was that?
- Last night.
Night Morris was murdered.
I saw a guy go in there five minutes before she did.
I thought he lived in the building, but then, 15 minutes later,
I see the guy chugging down the fire escape with something under his arm.
CHIN:
Computer tower?
Could've been.
- What did he look like?
- I don't know.
I tried taking a picture, but it was dark.
Did manage to get a partial plate before he took off.
What do you think?
Well, let's run the plates on the car.
Have Lori do it, and, uh, how do you feel about going to Maui?
Let's do it.
STEVE:
Good to see you back on the island, Jenna.
Your e-mail said it was important.
What's up?
I have a favor to ask you.
It's really big.
Is this about your fiancé?
Ever since I heard that Josh might be alive in Southeast Asia, I have been... pounding the pavement back in D.C.
After three months of analyzing classified intel and trading favors...
I found him.
Josh is alive.
Are you kidding me?
That's-that's great news, Jenna.
That's incredible.
Do you know where he is?
North Korea.
A, uh... a small rebel faction is holding Josh hostage near the border.
They got a hold of him after a CIA op went bad.
The one I messed up.
Okay.
Have you, um... have you taken this to the Agency?
Yeah.
They can't lift a finger.
They have to disavow any and all knowledge of his existence.
S.O.P. for this kind of job, behind enemy lines, covert op.
What do these rebels want?
They are willing to exchange Josh for $250,000, U.S. currency.
That's where I come in.
What, you can... you're thinking... wait a minute.
You're seriously considering going through with this?
If I don't, Josh is dead.
- Jenna...
- Do you understand?
I have no other options but to pay them.
Well... okay, have you got that kind of money?
I sold my parents' house in Virginia to get it.
It's all I have.
Where's this deal going down?
Their turf.
A small town about 20 miles south of Kaesong.
I can't go alone, Steve.
I need somebody there to watch my back.
I need you.
STEVE:
Yeah.
Yes, sir.
No, absolutely.
No, no, no.
Thank you, sir.
- What's up?
Any luck?
- No.
The Ranger unit that supported me in capturing
Anton Hesse in North Korea has been redeployed.
There's no way they can escort Jenna to the drop site.
(sighs)
Okay, listen.
I know you...
I know you want to put on the cape, and you want to go save the day, but please keep in mind, please, that this is not a puddle-jumper to Lana'i.
Okay?
This is North Korea.
I'm aware of that, thank you, Danny.
Okay.
What do you want to do?
What am I gonna do?
I got to help her.
I'd do the same for you, and anybody else here.
You know?
What am I gonna do?
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Please, just...
I'm just assuming, whatever it is you're about to do, you've done before, right?
Ah, it's classified.
Of course.
Do I... is that concern that I see?
Yeah, jerk.
I'm concerned.
Big deal.
I'll be fine, all right?
It's North Korea.
What could go wrong?
- Yeah, I know.
Hey.
- Hi.
Do me a favor and watch yourself, huh?
I'll think about you the whole time.
Thanks.
- Hmm.
What did I miss?
- Nothing.
He's, uh, got to go help a friend.
He'll be gone a couple days.
What's up?
You don't seem too happy about it.
- Is it something dangerous?
- No.
Guy's a Navy SEAL, right?
Everything's fine.
Nothing to worry about.
CHIN:
According to our suspect, your tenant, Jane Woodley, had a visitor a couple days ago.
Was this the woman?
Yeah, that's her.
Jane wasn't too happy about it, either.
Kimo, we need to find Jane.
Did she leave any forwarding information?
Maybe a credit card to hold the place?
I copied down her driver's license for the file.
Here it is.
That's Jenna Kaye.
And this woman was here for how long?
Three months at least.
Could you excuse us one minute?
Okay, what the hell?
Wasn't Jenna supposed to be in D.C. these last three months?
Yeah, McGarrett said that she was trying to find her fiancé.
Apparently, she's not trying very hard.
Well, if she lied to McGarrett about that, then what else is she lying about?
Listen to me, Jenna.
We don't give these guys any money until we get a positive I.D. on Josh, okay?

Hmm?
That story she sold me about her fiancé-- is it true?
Huh?

DANNY:
I just tried Steve's satellite phone 20 times in the last hour.
No answer.
The area they're in is all deep forest.
It may have blocked the signal.
No, something is wrong.
Something is wrong.
Otherwise, why would Jenna lie to us?
My question is, did Jenna have anything to do with Bethany Morris's murder?
LORI:
Hey.
- Any word from Steve?
- No, nothing.
Okay, look, there's got to be a number of logical explanations as to why he's not answering.
There's nothing logical about this.
Okay?
We just found out that someone we worked with-- someone that we trusted-- has been lying to us for months and now might have something to do with our murder.
KONO:
The only way we're going to get answers to any of this is by finding Bethany Morris's killer.
CHIN:
Lori, did you get anything on the suspect
Schulte said he saw scrambling out of Bethany's place?
Yeah, I got a hit off his partial plate.
It was a rental booked under the name Sung Paek.
DL's a fake, so I ran the name against hotel registries across the island-
- I got a match.
Kail Inn.
(gun fires) LORI:
Gun!
Clear.
Took himself out rather than get caught.
Why?
Desperation?
Fear?
Fear of what?
Prison?
LORI:
What might happen to him if he talked to us.
Guys, I think I got Bethany Morris's computer.
Looks like our guy was trying to hack into it.
What the hell is that thing?
It's a hard drive recovery system.
It's used for extracting encrypted data.
It's a virus.
Uh, Paek must have initiated it right before we breached.
LORI:
Can you stop it?
- No.
There might be a way to recover what's left, though.
DANNY:
You think you salvaged anything?
KONO:
Yeah.
I managed to recover a bunch of scattered data, including a couple pages from Bethany Morris's latest article, something called "Lost Prisoner of Fate."
CHIN:
What's it about?
Well, from what I could make out, it's, uh, about something called Operation Switchback.
That sounds like a military op.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Look at this.
It's part of an e-mail about a classified CIA file that looks like it's been 95% redacted.
CHIN:
Jenna was CIA.
Maybe that's why Bethany went to see her.
I checked in with Langley-- they have no official record of an op with that name.
- No, they're lying.
- Of course they're lying, but the interesting thing was, when I asked them about it, they transferred me to a number in North Carolina.
JSOC headquarters.
Which means Switchback was a joint
CIA-Special Forces operation, so no way we're going to get intel on that.
Want to bet?
You do realize those are one-by-twos, right, Wade?
I can measure.
Yeah.
Those are for supporting the windows, not for cross bracing.
Are you implying I don't know how to build a boar blind?
No, I'm not implying it;
I'm saying it.
Hey, Joe!
Would it kill you to stay in cell phone range?
Hey, what are you doing out here?
Listen, Joe, I need to know everything about a CIA-Special Forces joint operation called Switchback.
Uh, even if it rang a bell, I couldn't disclose anything about it.
What's so important about this op?
I have no idea, but a woman was murdered over it, and someone we used to work with might be involved now-- Jenna Kaye.
Well, why don't you ask her about it?
Yeah, I would, but, uh, I can't because she's with Steve in North Korea.
What?
I think he's in trouble, Joe.

The governor has to do something.
CHIN:
I don't know.
Steve went into North Korea on a completely unsanctioned personal mission.
He thought he was helping a friend.
Some friend.
(door opens)
- Any word?
- No, we're still waiting to hear if Danny can get the governor to help us.
You make any headway with the military?
Not in terms of rescuing Steve, but I did get some interesting intel about Operation Switchback that could help us.
What'd you find out?
It was a CIA op into North Korea that went bad, resulted in the capture of one Officer Joshua Hirsch.
That was Kaye's fiancé.
CHIN:
She took a leave from Five-O thinking he could be alive.
Seems a reporter named Bethany Morris was asking all about Operation Switchback, specifically about Officer Hirsch.
KONO:
Why?
She claimed she had a source in South Korea that said he was alive.
And since Jenna Kaye was listed as the intel officer for the op...
CHIN:
Bethany Morris went to see her to ask her about it.
Okay, so how does this help us?
Because the unredacted Switchback file details the location of a bunker just south of Kaesong, and it's suspected to be a cache for Wo Fat.
LORI:
Okay, Kaesong-- isn't that where
Kaye said she was when they got cut off?
Yeah.
Um, well, we can forget it, because even if the governor appealed to the State Department about launching a diplomatic mission, something like that could take weeks, maybe even months, to get approved.
We don't have that kind of time.
Something needs to get done right now or Steve's as good as dead.
That's right.
So what do we do?
We're going to bring Steve home.
Joe, what's with the medical supplies?
Can't go on a humanitarian mission to inoculate villagers in South Korea without the proper supplies.
- Ah.
Humanitarian mission.
Right.
It was either that or say that we were a band heading over there to entertain the troops.
So unless you play a mean bass...
So what happens when we hit the ground in Seoul?
We're on our own.
I'm going to need your badges and I.D.'s.
The minute this plane leaves the ground, we're just civilians.
That means no military supplies, fire support or friendlies in the area.
If the mission is compromised, we go on escape and evade.
And in the unlikely event that we pull this off, we could be charged with espionage, face federal prosecution and prison time for what we are about to do.
That is, of course, if any of us make it back.
So if anyone wants to back out, now is the time.
No shame in it.
Go with God and wish us luck.
All right, that settles it, then.
We come back with Steve, or we don't come back.
(tires screech)
All right, who's ready to kick ass and take names?
(chuckles)
Got room for a few members of SEAL Team 9 on this little, uh... what are you calling it?
Humanitarian mission.
Right.
That's what I thought.
Load it up, ladies.
Okay, uh, I thought we weren't gonna have any military backup.
Yeah, I mean, won't you guys get in serious trouble for this?
Well, technically, uh, Team 9 had a few days of R R coming, so we decided to do some sightseeing in Seoul.
Last I checked, we owe Commander McGarrett and Five-O a favor.
About a little midair rescue, as I recall.
Welcome aboard.
(grunting)
(Kaye gasping)
(door slams)
Why?
I had no choice.
We let you in.
We treated you as one of our own.
I trusted you.
I came down here, I didn't ask one question.
Wo Fat told me Josh was alive.
You just took him for his word?
He showed me his ring.
He had pictures.
But more than anything,
I needed to believe it.
I would have done anything to save him.
So you decided to trade him for me.
Yes.
So where is he, Kaye?
Huh?
You have to understand... this reporter came to me looking into Josh's operation.
She said she had a source that said that Josh was alive.
And I thought, if anyone could survive...
He's a lot like you.
A fighter, you know?
There was this one night... we were supposed to have dinner in D.C.
The Capitol Grille.
It was raining, and he was late, and his car wouldn't start, so he hops on his bike of all things.
Got in this horrible accident.
Got hit by a car.
Had to have these pins put in his knee.
And when I reached the hospital,
I just lit into him.
He's always rushing around like that for nothing.
That's when he pulled out the ring and he said,
"It wasn't for nothing."
The reporter who came to you... was her name Bethany Morris?
How did you know?
She's dead.
She had her neck snapped.
Did you know that?
No.
You don't get it, do you, Kaye?
Wo Fat was her source.
He sent... he sent Morris straight to you to give you hope that Josh was still alive.
And my hope got her killed.
GUTCHES:
All right, me and Joe have been studying the Switchback op.
Based on JSOC intel and the latest thermal imaging of the area where the team was taken, satellites have detected a flurry of recent activity around this old Korean War bunker.
JOE:
Activity in an area where there shouldn't be any activity, and border crossings where there shouldn't be border crossings.
All on foot, all in the last 24 hours.

Guess what?
You don't work here anymore.
- You're firing me?
- You can't do that.
I can, and I did.
You poke stick at cobra, you get the fangs!
And your days of free breakfasts are over,
Crockett and tubbs.
Oh, wonderful.
No job, no home.
I'm sorry, man.
I'd invite you to stay at my place, but...
Grandma doesn't let me have sleepovers.
Oh, man, I just wanted some oatmeal.
All right, the couch is yours till you get your own place.
Thank you.
Not a lot of rules here.
I'd appreciate you wearing flip-flops in the shower so we don't swap each other's foot fungus.
Got it.
Also, the bathroom sink is not a drinking fountain.
There is a cup in the holder, which I would prefer that you didn't drink from.
Anyway, make yourself at home.
I'm headed over to Molly's for dinner.
Tell her hello for me.
Will do.
Help yourself to whatever's in the fridge.
Just steer clear of the frozen Milky Way
I got hid behind the ice trays.
I'm not going to eat it, but I like knowing it's there.
Mike, I'm sorry I didn't take your advice today.
Yeah, well, I told you not to listen to Carl.
I know.
He talks a good game, but you are clearly the brains of the team.
Forgive me for not seeing it sooner.
Aw, don't beat yourself up about it.
We've all taken his bad advice from time to time.
There was a two-week period where I had spiky blond hair and a soul patch.
Well, have a nice time tonight.
You deserve an evening of friends and good food.
Plus it will give me the opportunity to sit here alone, contemplating where my life went so horribly wrong.
Everybody could use a little "me" time.
Samuel, would you...
I'll get my coat.
Okay.
Did you get enough to eat, Samuel?
I am perfectly satiated.
Dinner was delightful.
What did you call that dish again?
Pot roast.
You serve it at Abe's.
I had it Wednesday.
Listen, I know things seem pretty grim right now, but I'm sure something will turn up.
You know, when I first graduated from cosmetology school, there were no jobs anywhere.
And I thought, "oh, my God.
I just wasted three weeks of my life."
So how did you find work?
Right place, right time.
That's actually four words...
You know what?
Just...
Anyway,
I was dating this funeral director, and one day
I was taking a little "disco nap" in a empty casket.
You know, like you...
like you do.
Uh-huh.
And a client came in and thought I looked very natural, and asked who did my makeup.
I popped up and said, "that would be me, hon."
Well, before that woman came to,
I was embarking on an exciting new career...
Cosmetician to the recently deceased.
See?
Is those kinds of inspirational stories that brought me to this country.
That one made it all the way to Africa, huh?
Can I get you another glass of wine?
Well, how could I say no to a woman as beautiful as you?
Oh, my God, you're so charming.
I can't believe you're unemployed and homeless.
I know you'll find a job, and I know Mike is happy to have you stay at his place until you get back on your feet.
Well, hopefully I can accomplish that in the next 48 hours.
You said hit the bricks in two days, right?
Mike?
I'm just trying to keep a fire lit under his ass.
Oh...
He's here most of the time anyway, so you can have his place as long as you need it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, let's not get carried away.
Oh, really?
You're giving me that face?
Samuel, you're welcome to stay at my place for as long as you need.
Thank you, Mike.
You know, sometimes I think your body is so big just to accommodate the size of your heart.
Oh, what a beautiful way to say "you're fat."
So...
What is the deal with Molly's sister?
Hands off.
She's already got a boyfriend without a job.
Well, I just thought, if she's half as wonderful as Molly is...
All right, look.
I'm onto you, pal.
I see the little game you're playing.
What game, Mike?
I'm simply commenting on what a lucky man you are.
Yeah, I get it.
I have so much, and you have so little.
Is that supposed to be me?
Yes, it is.
And don't pretend like that accent doesn't thicken up like gravy when there are women around.
You know, perhaps it is better if I just wander the streets till morning.
Abe's opens at 5:00.
Oh, wait.
I can't go there anymore.
Look, I'm dropping you off at my place, but we're stopping at the 7-Eleven and getting a newspaper so you can start looking for a job first thing in the morning.
Of course.
And you're filling out an application at the 7-Eleven.
Absolutely.
And listen, Mike,
I cannot thank you enough for your generosity.
In my homeland, you would be revered as a king.
There would be a festival in your honor.
Women would name their children after you.
Your picture would be on money.
All right, what do you want now, my car?
Only when you're not using it.
So is Samuel still crashing at your place?
Yep.
Meanwhile, I'm stuck at Molly's, with her recycling rules and clipping my toenails over the toilet.
I don't know how much longer I can take it, Carl.
Yep.
Man's got to have his own space.
I tell you, if I didn't have my lawn chair in the garage, cohabitation with my grandma would be an impossibility.
Hey.
Why you flatfoots still come back here?
I told you before, no more free lunch.
Abe, come on.
Things got a little heated the other day but Samuel's a really good kid, and he really needs this job.
Is too late.
Position has already been filled.
Soo-Jin!
Customer!
She very good worker.
And since she my wife, it don't cost me one sweet dime.
What is it now?
I am watching Oprah, waiting for my "ah-ha" moment, and you not it.
Darling, please bring coffee to these two gentlemen.
She'll be right back with your beverage.
Hang on.
Are you telling me that pretty young thing is your wife?
Why not?
I'm a successful, good-looking man.
She's the big winner here.
So you can cover her fingers in diamonds, but you can't give Samuel a 50-cent raise?
Samuel don't dress up like catholic schoolgirl and call me "sweet papa."
Oh, thank you, baby.
Two large grapefruit juice.
We wanted coffee.
I wanted Ben Affleck, but I get him.
What the hell have you done with my apartment, and why are you wearing my drapes?
Oh.
Mike.
I didn't know you were stopping by.
I need to grab some clean clothes before I go to Molly's.
What is that smell?
I'm preparing a traditional African meal.
What is that, two missionaries in a crock-pot?
Very funny.
Anyway, I would invite you to stay, but
I have a lady friend coming over.
Please tell me it's not Molly's sister.
Oh, no, no, no, she gave me a fake number.
So hang on.
You don't have a job yet, but you've managed to find a date.
It's amazing what women will overlook if you have your own apartment.
But who am I talking to?
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, who told you you could move my furniture around?
I was doing you a favor.
The Feng Shui in here was atrocious.
When I open the front door,
I like to feel invited into the room.
Yeah, I get that about you.
How's the job hunt going?
I am weighing a few options.
I don't want to rush into a career path I'm not comfortable with.
Repeat after me:
"Paper or plastic?"
"Would you like fries with that?"
"Knock me in the water and win a stuffed bear!"
Can we table this discussion?
My lady friend will be here momentarily.
Look, Samuel, you need to find a job so you can get an apartment of your own and I can have my place back.
Hey, maybe your evening will go well, and you can move in with your new girlfriend.
Oh, I don't think that's a good idea.
I believe it's important for a man to have his own space, don't you?
You know, I'm starting to think you didn't leave Africa willingly.
You got kicked out.
Hey.
I was a political refugee.
You don't know the torment and struggle it took for me to get to America, where I can cherish the freedoms that you take for granted.
The fact that they kicked me out is beside the point.
Man, I can't find anything in this dump.
And by "dump," do you mean the house I grew up in that my dead father built?
I'm sorry, it's just that I hate living out of a suitcase.
You don't have to.
I cleared out some closet space and a couple of drawers for you.
No, no point in me settling in.
As soon as Samuel's out of there, I'm back to my place.
Yeah, but that could be a couple of weeks, maybe a month.
And whose fault is that?
Judging from your tone, I guess you think it's mine?
Look, Molly.
I know what's going on here.
It's in every gal's nature to want to nest with an Alpha male.
Really?
Let's... go on.
Well, as much as I hope one day we'll be living under the same roof,
I'm just not ready for that right now.
Oh, I get it.
You're like a wild, untamed stallion and here I am, trying to hook you up to a plow.
I said it's not your fault.
It's your womanly instincts.
I'm not quite following you, but that's probably just because
I'm burdened with this crazy lady brain.
You know...
Look, I'm not saying you're trying to trap me as much as... reel me in.
I see.
Less horse, more fish.
'Cause you know what, if I really wanted to trap you,
I'd dig a really big hole in the backyard and cover it with moon pies.
See, you're getting angry.
I told you.
I don't blame you.
It's your DNA.
Looks like one of those giant manatees, sunning itself on a big rock.
You know, that's where the legends of the mermaids come from.
Sailors would often mistake them for women.
Well, to me that just sounds like a lame excuse for some bad behavior.
Whoa, where am I?
It would appear the doghouse.
I don't know what you did to pee on her parade, but if you slept on the couch, you're still in midstream.
Morning, mom.
Vince.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
Morning.
I'm guessing time has not healed these wounds.
Yeah, I picked up on that, too.
I-I'd wait till she had her coffee.
Otherwise she's a real ball-buster.
I heard that!
It's true!
Got a crick in my neck from camping out on the sofa last night.
Oh, no.
What a shame.
Poor thing.
You look very pretty this morning.
Well-rested.
Well, it's easy to sleep when you've got nothing on your mind but lipstick and man-trapping.
Okay, look, I never said "trap."
But I am sorry for, you know.
Acting like an ass?
Well, I wouldn't necessarily say "ass." Oh, big baby, thoughtless moron, uh...
Let's just go with "ass."
You know, I was trying to be nice and accommodating to you and your friend, and what do I get in return?
Accusations that I'm trying to trap you.
Let her drink her coffee.
Stay out of it, mom!
I understand you wanting your own space, believe me.
Having the bed to myself last night was like a mini-vacation.
I could stretch out.
I didn't have to worry about your arm slamming down on my head like a giant meat log.
I'm sorry, Molly.
It's not that I don't want to stay with you.
I just like having my apartment as kind of a safety net.
So do I. I'm not ready for us to live together.
Well, good.
Because even if I don't use it, I like knowing it's there.
Yeah.
Kinda like the Milky Way you keep hidden behind your ice trays.
You know about that.
I've replaced it three times.
I've replaced it four times.
Hey, you don't keep one here, do you?
In the vegetable crisper!
Mom!
I'm sorry, I asked for scrambled... this is over easy.
Now scrambled.
That woman is the worst waitress in the world.
Who cares?
Look at her.
She could bring me a urinal cake and I'd eat it.
Hey, Samuel.
What are you doing here?
Abe called me out of the blue and offered me my job back with the raise he promised.
I told you, man.
You stayed strong and you won.
I know, Carl.
I'm so glad I listened to you.
You are clearly the brains of the team.
Well, next time you could crash at his place.
I hope you like the top bunk, and waking up to a faceful of model airplane.
Don't worry.
I'll be out of your home as soon as
I can put together enough for first and last months' rent, security deposit, and the premium cable package.
I'm afraid you've spoiled me.
Oh, Samuel.
Samuel.
Welcome back.
You and me are good, right?
Yeah, we're good.
All right.
Go fire my wife.
Okay.
So, 50 cent an hour raise makes $20 a week.
This should cover till the end of the month.
Nice when payoff go the other way, huh, Serpico?
What's going on?
You covering Samuel's raise?
I'd have paid twice as much to get him out of my apartment.
Although I got to admit, he did a nice job redecorating the place.
I know.
I saw it the other night when I went to his party.
Party?
I mean, I understand that the woman is new to the school and everybody's bending over backwards trying to make her feel welcome but teacher of the month?
Please.
- That's an outrage.
- And it has nothing to do with the fact that I was teacher of the month for the last six months.
You know, two more and I would've gotten to keep the ceramic owl.
I did not know that.
Not that I'm bragging, you know just a deserved recognition for being a good teacher.
I didn't get it for wearing a push-up bra and giggling like an idiot every time some man makes a funny.
Reminds me.
Did you hear the joke about the blind prostitute?
Mike, I'm telling you about my day.
Punch line is, you gotta hand it to her.
- You know, because she's blind.
- Yeah.
I tell you, Joyce, I'm really starting to get the hang of this yoga malarkey.
If I get any more limber, I won't need you anymore.
Hey, cowboy, if you can do it, do it.
That cuts my workload in half.
She's got you doing yoga.
Yeah.
She wants to show me off at her high school reunion.
That's why she's got me twisting in knots and sniffing my own buttocks.
I can't wait to glide into that Sheraton banquet hall with this hunk of Italian sausage on my arm.
You know, when you describe me as a piece of meat it makes me feel like a piece of meat.
Anyway, if you ask me little Miss Teacher of the Month is in for a rude awakening.
And we're back.
She's gonna find that field trips and learning games and trying to be best friend with the kids is not a substitute for actual teaching.
I mean, she lets the kids call her by her first name.
There is a balance between being loving and being firm and I don't think Miss Jennifer gets that.
It's just insane the way people are fawning all over her.
Oh, did I tell you about the parking spot they gave her?
You did.
I was appalled.
Oh, look, Escape from the Planet of the Apes is on.
That's the one where the monkeys go back in time and wear suits and get jobs.
- Mike.
- That parking thing is a travesty.
Right?
And meanwhile, I'm parking behind the cafeteria under a tree filled with birds who apparently eat nothing but lasagna and chocolate milk.
My glutes are still vibrating from that yoga class.
You could shake up a martini in my crack.
Hey, I just got a batch of Cuban cigars and I thought you might wanna partake.
That sounds great.
Mike, we're in the middle of a conversation.
It's just the middle?
I'd love to, Vince, but my girlfriend is sharing her day with me.
Actually, we're sharing our days with each other.
Yeah, right, that.
Well, have you gotten to the part where you passed on an $80 cigar because you were pretending to listen to your girlfriend?
I'm not pretending.
I listen to every word she says.
I can tell you for a fact that today for lunch Molly had lasagna and chocolate milk.
Go smoke.
Nothing like the taste of a fine Havana cigar smuggled through the negligent borders of our Canadian cousins.
Lucky for the both of us, we're burning the evidence.
Where the commies fall short is tennis shoes and electronics.
Never ever buy a Cuban iPhone or a pair of Air Castros.
Good to know.
Listen, I wanted to talk to you about something.
Kind of a personal matter.
Oh, boy, everybody's in a chatty mood tonight.
What I'm about to tell you is strictly hush-hush.
Because if Joyce ever found out, it would kill her.
Thank you for the cigar and the pleasant conversation but I don't wanna hear about another woman.
Whoa, whoa, this ain't about me getting some on the side, jeez.
I gotta pop oysters and stiffy pills just to keep up with the big red machine in there.
Good, because I really wanna finish that cigar.
Come on, sit down.
Take a considerable load off.
Okay, here it is.
All this talk about Joyce's high school reunion has made me feel bad about not being a high school graduate.
Is that it?
Yeah, what'd you think?
I was gonna profess my love to you?
No.
It's just that not graduating from high school isn't that big a deal.
It is to me.
And I've never told that to another living soul.
You're kidding?
I was gonna confide it to my wife on her deathbed but we had so many other important things to talk about.
- Of course.
- Code to the alarm system her recipe for manicotti what dry cleaners my good black suit was at.
If you're worried about what Joyce will think, I'm sure she'll understand.
Joyce must never know.
I don't want her to find out my worldly, sophisticated exterior is nothing but a facade.
Technically, the exterior is the facade.
I think it's French or something.
See, that right there is why I don't tell people.
You're already talking to me like I'm an idiot.
I'm saying you shouldn't feel bad about not graduating high school.
Easy for you to say, you're a learned man.
Well, I wouldn't say learned, but I had a strong C average in high school which made the transition to junior college a smooth path.
You're telling me you went to college?
Two full years and a mandatory summer session.
That was eighth grade for me.
Geometry made me its bitch.
Well, why don't you just get your GED?
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
You're a government employee maybe you could pull a couple of strings and slide me one under the table.
Doesn't work that way.
This isn't something I could fix like a parking ticket.
- Told me you couldn't fix parking tickets.
- I can't.
Then why you dangling the carrot?
Look, if you wanna get your GED, you gotta take the test.
Lucky for you, there's a woman in that house that can help you study.
- Molly.
- Voted teacher of the month six times in a row.
She received the coveted ceramic owl.
She doesn't really like me, though.
I mean, I get that kids are always standoffish when they know you're banging their mom.
But she goes the extra mile.
Yeah, she has yet to succumb to your unique charms.
Plus, women tell each other everything and she'll end up blabbing it to Joyce.
Can't argue with you there.
That family could talk underwater.
Maybe you could get a tutor.
- How about you?
- I don't know.
I was always kind of a wing-and-a-prayer kind of student.
They used to call me Mr. CliffsNotes.
But what about junior college?
It's really just a high school where you can smoke.
My point exactly.
If a load like you can get kicked through the system there's still hope for me.
Well, that's not flattering, but I can certainly see what got you there.
Oh, a shower was a good idea.
I am fresh as a daisy.
Unfortunately, now your loofah smells like cigar smoke and BO.
Sexy.
Did you and Vince have a good time tonight?
It was okay.
He's a decent enough guy.
See, that's where you and I part ways.
What did he wanna talk to you about?
Nothing in particular.
Just cigar talk.
Cigar talk?
You know, "This is a good cigar." "Glad you like it." "I like it a lot."
"Hey, is that a cat?" "No, it's a possum." Cigar talk.
Well, I guess that's more fun than having a conversation with your girlfriend.
Only because of the cigars and the possum sighting.
May I offer you some squeaky-clean loving?
Hang on.
Hang on.
So Vince just wanted to give you an $80 cigar and didn't want anything in return?
Same guy that offered you a box of steaks in exchange for a handicapped parking pass?
I felt bad about that.
He'd already bought those nice aluminum crutches.
He just wanted to share something in confidence.
You know, man-to-man.
Anything to do with my mom?
Not really.
I mean, other than the fact he doesn't want her to know about it.
Are you telling me he's keeping something from her?
Just because he's deeply ashamed.
Okay, so if that's a no on the sex, I will bid you good night.
What can I do?
A man tells me a secret, I gotta take it to the grave.
Of course.
So Vince Moranto didn't graduate high school.
You understand why I couldn't tell Molly, right?
Absolutely.
It's a personal private matter.
And we all know women are notorious blabbermouths.
Hate to say it, but it is kind of true.
I tell my grandma one secret, next thing you know everybody in Church is peeking to see if I'm going commando under my choir robe.
You actually do that?
If they spent the money on air conditioning instead of that stupid youth bus I wouldn't have to be swinging low while I'm singing "Sweet Chariot."
What are you talking about?
Molly's mom's boyfriend told Mike something in confidence.
Now Molly's upset because Mike didn't tell her what it is.
Women love the gossip, don't they?
In Senegal, I once dated two sisters at the same time.
It was less than a week before they blabbed it to each other.
On top of that, they tried to make me the bad guy.
- So, what is the big secret?
- Vince didn't graduate high school.
Interesting.
You know, Henry, the cook, is a dropout too.
But you didn't hear it from me.
I was looking through the study guides and they say the best way to start is by taking a sample test.
Whoa, whoa, right to it?
No foreplay?
You don't wanna dance or rub zippers?
This is just a way to find out where your weak areas are and what we need to concentrate on.
- I can tell you what my weak areas are.
Processing dairy and taking tests.
And they both turn my bowels into an ass cannon.
Vince, relax.
And remember, most of this stuff is just common sense.
- Take your time and do your best.
- All right.
"Which of the following political actions violated the principles of unalienable rights of liberty that evolved from the U.S. Declaration of Independence?"
Is this for high school or to become president of the United States?
Come on, just think it through and break it down.
I told you, I don't break things down well and I had a milk shake for lunch.
All right, let's just move on to the next question.
Fine. "Which three of the original 13 colonies...?"
For crying out loud, I don't know if this is math or history.
Yeah, I'm not really sure where they're headed either.
Just forget it.
I'm not good at tests.
I've never been good at tests.
I get nervous, I can't focus, I get fidgety.
- ADD?
- Hey, I can add.
I just don't like tests.
- Bathroom break.
- Vince, we just got started.
Wasn't really a question.
This one right here was prom queen junior and senior year.
She's a cute little filly.
Now she's a beer-hauling Clydesdale.
Well, that prom queen is gonna be green with envy when she sees you walking in with your yoga booty and your sexy man on your arm.
Oh, yeah.
She'll be snorting and stomping her hoof.
I better bring some carrots and sugar cubes.
- Something smells good in here.
- I'm trying a new brownie recipe.
The secret is less brownie, more pot.
Don't burn it like the last batch.
I was secondhand high for a week.
So where's Vince tonight?
He said he had to work late, but he's coming over later.
That reminds me, I gotta wax the wigglies.
Hey, is, uh, everything okay with you two?
Sure.
Have you noticed anything odd about his behavior?
Well, he's been a little cranky lately.
But he's probably just annoyed at me for pushing him to lose weight grow hair and have his neck waddle taped back.
- Why do you ask?
- Oh, no reason.
You're my mom, I love you, I just wanna make sure you're happy.
- Oh, well, thank you, baby.
Oh...
I am.
Good.
Ha, ha.
Working late.
That dirtbag's not even a good liar.
What's going on?
I don't know for sure.
But I know he and Mike had a little secret man talk last night and Mike's being very cagey about it.
You don't think Vince is doing anything behind Mom's back?
See, that's where my mind went too.
My God, he's cheating on her, isn't he?
You did not hear that from me.
How long is it gonna take to grade this thing?
Hang on a second.
"Add the combined scores of sentence structure and usage with the subtotal of language arts from Page 3."
Man, this is like putting together a bookcase from Ikea.
You know, forget about it.
I'm sure I flunked.
No.
Now, just hang on a second.
We don't know that.
Bup-bup-bup, carry the two...
Now we know that you flunked.
My old man always told me I was an idiot.
You know what?
He was right.
You're not an idiot.
You're just not a good test taker.
Remarkably bad, in fact.
Well, how else am I gonna get a GED?
Abraham Lincoln never graduated high school.
- He did pretty well for himself.
- Yeah, except for getting shot in the head.
To be fair, a high school diploma is not gonna stop a bullet.
So you're saying I just gotta live with my secret shame?
Everybody's got one.
I'll share mine if it makes you feel better.
Food?
Maybe.
The more you try to hide it, the worse it's gonna feel.
- Just go to Joyce and tell her the truth.
- I don't know.
You'll feel better.
The woman loves you.
She's not gonna judge you over something like that.
Would you mind going with me to tell her?
You know, for moral support.
I'd be happy to.
All right.
Boy, I hope she's gonna be okay when she finds out her erudite prince is just a well-hung frog.
"Erudite." I can't believe you didn't score higher in the verbal.
Listen, when I get in there I may embellish my reasons for dropping out of school a little bit.
Papa got sick, I had to work the fields, care for the other young'uns.
Something in that vein.
For another cigar, I'll tell her you were a coal miner's daughter.
- What is going on here, Mike?
- I gotta talk to your mom.
He just needs to get something off his chest.
What's that?
The breasts of a younger woman?
Joyce, doll, why are you crying?
I know all about your dirty little secret.
Who told you?
Did you tell her?
I didn't tell anybody, except Carl and Samuel.
Oh, you could tell Carl and Samuel, but you couldn't tell me.
You thought you could keep something like that from me?
- Boy, you're dumber than I thought.
- I had to work the fields.
You are such a pig.
Whoa, I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but you're kind of making me feel bad.
Well, you should feel bad.
You're cheating on my mother.
- What?
I never cheated on you.
Mm-hm.
Then why are you here with your tail between your legs?
I came to tell you I don't have a high school diploma.
And now, thanks to Lumpy, the study partner, I never will.
- What?
- I was ashamed to tell you because I thought you'd think less of me, but apparently you already do.
You told me he was having an affair.
No.
Now...
I didn't exactly use those words.
It's all moot.
Damage is done.
I got this, Mom.
"Moot." The man is a wordsmith.
Vince, wait.
Look, I get that I'm not your favorite person but I never thought you'd spread lies about me.
- I'm sorry.
- I may not have a formal education or a high school diploma, but I got a heart.
And you stuck a knife in it by way of my back.
I know.
I made a terrible mistake.
Let me...
Let me make it up to you.
How?
A kick in the groin?
No, thank you.
- Hey, Moranto.
- What?
I think you owe me an apology too.
You have got an actual teacher right here and you asked Mike to tutor you.
I regret that deeply.
The only thing I learned from that guy is that the Chicago Police Department is not a very picky organization.
Come on, give me a chance.
Why you wanna help me?
Well, that's why I became a teacher.
And seeing as that you're my mom's fiancé kind of makes you family.
- Family?
- Kind of.
Damn it, you're a tough nut to crack.
But I love you, snowball.
I really do.
Okay, okay.
Oh, Vince, I'm so sorry I doubted you.
We just didn't know what to think, Vince.
But stupid is so much better than cheater.
I forgive all you broads.
Hey, where's the big guy?
Yes.
The apes do wear suits and get jobs.
Wow, I can't believe you got Vince to actually go and take the GED exam.
Well, part of what a good teacher does is to inspire her students, you know.
Instill in them the confidence that they need to go out and achieve academic excellence.
I guess we know why you hold the record for teacher of the month.
Heh.
Every student is different.
You have to figure out what their individual needs are.
Now, for Vince, I just had to give him the proper tools to overcome his fear of taking tests.
Oh, man, do you guys know what happened to the two pot brownies I was saving?
Don't you want somebody to love
Don't you need somebody to love
Done.
I mean, I understand that the woman is new to the school and everybody's bending over backwards trying to make her feel welcome, but "teacher of the month?"
Please.
That's an outrage.
And it has nothing to do with the fact that I was "teacher of the month" for the last six months.
You know, two more and I would have gotten to keep the ceramic owl.
I did not know that.
Not that I'm bragging, you know.
Just a deserved recognition for being a good teacher.
I didn't get it for wearing a push-up bra and giggling like an idiot every time some man "makes a funny."
(Chuckles)
That reminds me.
Did you hear the joke about the blind prostitute?
Mike, I'm telling you about my day.
Punch line is "you gotta hand it to her." (Laughs)
You know, 'cause she's blind.
Yeah.
Vince:
I tell you, Joyce,
I'm really starting to get the hang of this yoga malarkey.
If I get any more limber, I won't need you anymore.
Hey, cowboy, if you can do it, do it.
That cuts my workload in half.
She's got you doing yoga?
Yeah, she wants to show me off at her high school reunion.
That's why she's got me twisting in knots and sniffing my own buttocks.
I can't wait to glide into that Sheraton banquet hall with this hunk of Italian sausage on my arm.
You know, when you describe me as a piece of meat, it makes me feel like a piece of meat.
Anyway, if you ask me, I think little miss "teacher of the month"
is in for a rude awakening.
And we're back.
She's gonna, she's gonna find that your field trips, and learning games and, you know, trying to be best friends with the kids is not the-- a substitute for actual teaching.
I mean, she lets the kids call her by her first name.
There is a balance between being loving and being firm.
I don't think miss Jennifer gets that.
♪ For the first time in my life ♪
♪ I see love. ♪
It's just insane the way people are fawning all over her.
Oh, did I tell you about the great parking spot they gave her?
You did.
I was appalled.
Oh, look, escape from the planet of the apes is on.
I think that's the one where the monkeys go back in time and wear suits and get jobs.
Mike.
That parking thing is a travesty.
Right?
And meanwhile, I'm parking behind the cafeteria, under a tree filled with birds who apparently eat nothing but lasagna and chocolate milk.
My glutes are still vibrating from that yoga class.
You could shake up a Martini in my crack.
Hey, I just got a batch of Cuban cigars and I thought you might want to partake.
That sounds great.
Mike, we're-we're in the middle of a conversation.
It's just the middle?
I'd love to Vince, but, uh, my girlfriend is sharing her day with me.
Actually, we're sharing our days with each other.
Yeah, right.
That.
Well, have you gotten to the part where you pass on an $80 cigar because you were pretending to listen to your girlfriend?
Hey, I'm not pretending.
I listen to every word she says.
I could tell you for a fact that today, for lunch,
Molly had lasagna and chocolate milk.
Go smoke.
Nothing like the taste of a fine havana cigar smuggled through the negligent borders of our Canadian cousins.
Lucky for the both of us, we're burning the evidence.
Where the commies fall short is tennis shoes and electronics.
Never ever buy a Cuban iPhone or a pair of air castros.
Good to know.
Listen,
I wanted to talk to you about something.
Kind of a personal matter.
Oh, boy, everybody's in a chatty mood tonight.
What I'm about to tell you is strictly hush-hush.
'Cause if Joyce ever found out, it would kill her.
Thank you for the cigar and the pleasant conversation, but I don't want to hear about another woman.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This ain't about me getting some on the side.
Geez.
I got to pop oysters and stiffy pills just to keep up with the big red machine in there.
Good.
'Cause I really want to finish that cigar.
Come on, sit down.
Take a considerable load off.
Okay, here it is.
All this talk about Joyce's high school reunion has made me feel bad about not being a high school graduate.
Is that it?
Yeah, what'd you think,
I was gonna profess my love to you?
No, it's just that not graduating from high school isn't that big a deal.
It is to me.
And I've never told that to another living soul.
You're kidding.
Well,
I was gonna confide it to my wife on her death bed, but we had so many other important things to talk about.
Of course.
Code to the alarm system, her recipe for manicotti, what dry cleaners my good black suit was at.
Well, if you're worried about what Joyce will think,
I'm sure she'll understand.
Joyce must never know.
I don't want her to find out my worldly, sophisticated exterior is nothing but a facade.
You know, technically, the exterior is the facade.
I think it's French or something.
See, that right there is why I don't tell people.
You're already talking to me like I'm an idiot.
No, I'm just saying, you shouldn't feel bad about not graduating high school.
Easy for you to say;
You're a learned man.
Well, I wouldn't say "learned,"
but I had a strong "c" average in high school, which made the transition to junior college a smooth path.
Hang on.
You're telling me you went to college?
Two full years and a mandatory summer session.
That was eighth grade for me!
Geometry made me its bitch.
Ell, why don't you just get your ged?
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
You're a government employee.
Maybe you could pull a couple of strings and slide me one under the table.
Doesn't really work that way.
This isn't something I can just fix, like a parking ticket.
You told me you couldn't fix parking tickets.
I can't.
Then why are you dangling the carrot?
Look, if you want to get your ged, you got to take the test.
But lucky for you, there's a woman in that house that can help you study.
You mean Molly.
Voted "teacher of the mont"" six times in a row.
She received the coveted ceramic owl.
She doesn't really like me, though.
I mean, I get that kids are always standoffish when they know you're banging their mom, but she goes the extra mile.
Yeah, she has yet to succumb to your unique charms.
Plus, women tell each other everything, and she'll end up blabbing it to Joyce.
Can't argue with you there.
That family could talk underwater.
Hey, maybe you could get a tutor.
How 'bout you?
I don't know.
I was always kind of a "wing and a prayer" kind of student.
They used to call me Mr. cliff notes.
But what about junior college?
That's really just a high school where you can smoke.
My point exactly.
If a load like you can get kicked through the system, there's still hope for me.
Well, that's not flattering, but I can certainly see what got you there.
(Door opens, Mike sighs)
A shower was a good idea.
I am fresh as a Daisy.
Unfortunately, now your loofah smells like cigar smoke and b.O.
Sexy.
Did you and Vince have a good time tonight?
It was okay.
He's a decent enough guy.
See, that's where you and I part ways.
What did he want to talk to you about?
Nothing in particular.
Just cigar talk.
"Cigar talk?" You know,
"this is a good cigar."
"Glad you like it." "I like it a lot."
"Hey, is that a cat?"
"No, it's a possum." Cigar talk.
Well, I guess that's more fun than having a conversation with your girlfriend.
Only because of the cigars and the possum sighting.
May I offer you some squeaky-clean loving?
Hang on, hang on.
So Vince just wanted to give you an $80 cigar and didn't want anything in return?
Same guy that offered you a box of steaks in exchange for a handicap parking pass.
I felt bad about that.
He already bought those nice aluminum crutches.
But tonight, he just wanted to share something in confidence, you know, man-to-man.
Doesn't have anything to do with my mom, does it?
Not really;
I mean, other than the fact he doesn't want her to know about it.
Wait a minute, are you telling me that he's keeping something from her?
Just because he's deeply ashamed.
Okay.
So if that's a "no" on the sex,
I will bid you good night.
What can I do?
A man tells me a secret,
I got to take it to the grave.
Of course.
So Vince moranto didn't graduate high school.
And you can understand why I couldn't tell Molly that, right?
Absolutely.
It's a personal, private matter.
And we all know women are notorious blabbermouths.
I hate to say it, but it is kind of true, isn't it?
I tell my grandma one secret and the next thing you know, everybody in church is peeking around to see if I'm really going commando underneath my choir robe.
You actually do that?
If they spent the money on air-conditioning instead of that stupid youth bus,
I wouldn't have to be swinging low while I'm singing "sweet chariot""
hey, what are you guys talking about?
Molly's mom's boyfriend told Mike something in confidence, and now Molly's upset because Mike didn't tell her what it is.
Oh... women love the gossip, don't they?
In Senegal, I once dated two sisters at the same time, and it was less than a week before they blabbed it to each other.
Then on top of that, they tried to make me the bad guy.
So what is the big secret?
Vince didn't graduate high school.
Interesting.
You know, Henry the cook is a dropout, too.
But you didn't hear it from me.
So, I was looking through one of the study guides, and they say the best way to start is by taking a sample test.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Right to it?
No foreplay?
You don't want to dance or rub zippers?
Look, this is just a way to find out where your weak areas are and what we need to concentrate on.
I can tell you what my weak areas are:
Processing dairy and taking tests.
And they both turn my bowels into an ass Cannon.
Vince, relax.
And remember, most of this stuff is just common sense.
So take your time and do your best.
All right.
"Which of the following political actions
"violated the principles of unalienable rights of liberty that evolved from the U.S. Declaration of independence?"
Is this for high school or to become President of the United States?
Come on.
Just think it through and break it down.
I told you,
I don't break things down well, and I had a milk shake for lunch.
All right, let's just move on to the next question.
Fine.
"Which three of the original 13 colonies..."
For crying out loud,
I don't know if this is math or history.
I'm not really sure where they're headed, either.
Just forget it.
I'm not good at tests.
I never been good at tests.
I get nervous, I can't focus, I get fidgety.
Add?
Hey, I can add.
I just don't like tests.
Bathroom break.
Vince, we just got started.
Wasn't really a question.
This one right here was prom queen, junior and senior year.
She's a cute little filly.
Now she's a beer-hauling clydesdale.
Well, that prom queen is going to be green with envy when she sees you walking in, with your yoga Booty and your sexy man on your arm.
Oh, yeah.
She'll be snorting and stomping her hoof.
I better bring some carrots and sugar cubes.
Ooh, something smells good in here.
I'm trying a new brownie recipe.
The secret is lessg smells brownie, more pot.Ere.
Don't burn it like the last batch.
I was second-hand high for a week.
So... where's Vince tonight?
Mm, he said he had to work late, but he's coming over later.
Ooh, that reminds me.
I gotta wax the wigglies.
Hey, is, uh, everything okay with you two?
Sure.
You didn't notice anything odd about his behavior?
Well, he's been a little cranky lately, but he's probably just annoyed at me for pushing him to lose weight, grow hair and have his neck wattle taped back.
Why do you ask?
Oh, no reason.
You're my mom.
I love you.
Just want to make sure you're happy.
Oh.
Well, thank you, baby.
Oh.
I am.
Good.
(Chuckles)
"Working late""
that dirtbag's not even a good liar.
What's going on?
I don't know for sure.
But I know that he and Mike had a little secret man talk last night, and Mike's being very cagey about it.
You don't think Vince is doing anything behind mom's back, do you?
See, that's where my mind went, too.
Oh, my God, he's cheating on her, isn't he?
You did not hear that from me.
How long is it going to take you to grade this thing?
Hang on a second.
"Add the combined scores of sentence structure and usage with the subtotal of language arts from page three."
Man, this is like putting together a bookcase from Ikea.
You know what?
Forget about it.
I'm sure I flunked.
No.
Now, just hang on a second.
We don't know that.
Bup, bup, bup...
Carry the two...
Now we know that you flunked.
My old man always told me I was an idiot.
You know what?
He was right.
Come on, you're not an idiot.
You're just not a good test taker.
Remarkably bad, in fact.
Well, how else am I going to get a ged?
Abraham Lincoln never graduated high school.
He did pretty well f himself.
Yeah, except for getting shot in the head.
To be fair, a high school diploma's not going to stop a bullet.
So you're saying I just got to live with my secret shame?
Everybody's got one.
I'll share mine with you, it makes you feel better.
Food?
Maybe.
The point is, the more you try to hide it, the worse it's going to feel.
Why don't you just go to Joyce and tell her the truth?
I don't know.
You'll feel a lot better.
And the woman loves you.
She's not going to judge you over something like that.
Would you mind going with me to tell her?
You know, for moral support.
I'd be happy to.
All right.
Boy, I hope she's going to be okay when she finds out her erudite prince is just a well-hung frog.
"Erudite." I can't believe you didn't score higher on the verbal.
Listen.
When I get in there, I may embellish my reasons for dropping out of school a little bit.
Papa got sick, I had to work the fields, care for the other young'uns.
Something in that vein.
For another cigar,
I'll tell her you were a coal miner's daughter.
What is going on here, Mike?
I gotta talk to your mom.
He just needs to get something off his chest.
Yeah?
What's that?
The breasts of a younger woman?
Joyce, doll, why you crying?
I know all about your dirty little secret.
Who told you?
Did you tell her?
I didn't tell anybody.
Except Carl and Samuel.
Oh!
You could tell Carl and Samuel, but you couldn't tell me!
You really thought you could keep something like that from me?
Boy, you're dumber than I thought.
I had to work the fields.
(Groans):
Oh...
You're such a pig!
Whoa!
I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but you're kind of making me feel bad.
Well, you should feel bad.
You're cheating on my mother.
What?
!
Mm-hmm.
I never cheated on you.
Then why you showing up here with your tail tucked between your legs?
I came to tell you
I don't have a high school diploma.
And now, thanks to lumpy, the study partner,
I never will.
What?
I was ashamed to tell you, 'cause I thought you'd think less of me.
But apparently you already do.
You told me he was having an affair!
No.
Now...
I didn't exactly use those words.
It's all moot.
Damage is done.
I got this, mom.
"Moot." The man is a wordsmith.
Vince, wait.
Look,
I get that I'm not your favorite person, but I never thought you'd spread lies about me.
I'm sorry.
I may not have a formal education or a high school diploma, but I got a heart;
And you stuck a knife in it by way of my back.
I know.
I-I made a terrible mistake.
Let me make it up to you.
How?
A kick in the groin?
No, thank you.
Hey!
Moranto!
What?
I think you owe me an apology, too.
I mean, you have an actual teacher right here, and you asked Mike to tutor you.
I regret that deeply.
The only thing I learned from that guy is that the Chicago police department is not a very picky organization.
Come on.
Give me a chance.
Why you want to help me?
Well, it's why I became a teacher.
And seeing as that you're my mom's fiancé,
I... kind of makes you family.
Family?
Kind of.
Damn it, you're a tough nut to crack.
But I love you, snowball, I really do.
Okay, okay.
Oh, Vince, I'm so sorry I doubted you.
We just didn't know what to think, Vince.
But stupid is so much better than cheater.
I forgive all you broads.
Hey, where's the big guy?
Yes!
The apes do wear suits and get jobs.
Wow, I can't believe you got Vince to actually go and take the ged exam.
****entire sentence missing**** to go out and achieve academic excellence.
Well, I guess we know why you hold the record for "teacher of the month." (Chuckles)
Every student is different.
You have to figure out what their individual needs are.
Now, for Vince,
I just had to give him the proper tools to overcome his fear of taking tests.
Oh, man.
Do you guys know what happened to the two pot brownies I was saving?
(Quietly): ♪ don't you want somebody to love?
♪
♪ don't you need somebody to love?
♪
Done.
Look.
Where?
There.
Yes.
I think so.
Hello.
Are you a new student?
Yes.
Good.
We thought so.
We'd like to help you.
Help me?
Uh...
What do you mean?
As a freshman, it can be very tough.
You get to college and it's supposed to be great, but it's not.
University life can be pretty bad.
There are a lot of suicides.
Well, attempted ones.
I'm not actually a freshman.
I'm a transfer student.
Oh, an entering sophomore?
Yes.
You were unappy and are looking to recover here.
Well, I think you will.
Yes.
Would you welcome that?
Would our help be something you'd appreciate?
Or would you rather sink or swim on your own?
Either way is fine.
We'll be friends.
Yes, whichever you'd prefer.
Yes.
Sure.
Great.
Heh.
We should start immediately.
Clothes can be crucial for confidence and an overall sense of well-being.
Clothes don't have to be expensive.
You need friends of the same size.
You don't like my clothes?
I'm just saying.
Move it out.
What?
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
You didn't notice that?
No.
What?
Those guys.
That smell.
That awful, acrid odour.
Have you heard of nasal shock syndrome?
Any harsh, acrid or just disgusting odour sends Rose into nasal shock.
Just from some BO?
"Just some BO"?
Oh, my God, Lily.
You must have a very high threshold for pain.
That'll serve you well at Seven Oaks.
What do you mean?
Seven Oaks is notorious for its BO.
It was the last of the Select Seven to go coed.
An atmosphere of male barbarism predominates, but we're going to change that.
Yes.
Where are you going?
Gotta get to the Housing Department.
They lost my rooming assignment.
That's terrible.
You have no place to stay?
Was it just mislaid?
No, there were more acceptances than they anticipated, and not enough rooms to go around, so...
Why don't you stay with us?
Really?
Don't think of this in the old-fashioned sense of going to a party to find someone or not find someone.
That's not the dynamic that we're talking about.
What dynamic are you talking about?
Glad you asked.
Our going to a party of this kind is more a form of youth outreach.
Of what?
Youth outreach.
It's not just some moronic frat-house social function.
Though it will be that too.
We've gotta keep in mind that these guys are young people.
They're essentially immature and crying out for help and guidance.
Though they don't know it.
No, they don't, but we do.
Arert they the same age as we are?
Only numerically.
I'm a lot fatter than you are, but I think we could pin it.
Oh, my gosh, that's beautiful.
Ooh la la.
Stunning.
Take Frank, my friend.
He's not some cool, handsome, studly macho type.
No, not at all.
I can't stand guys like that.
He's more of a sad sack really, wouldn't you say?
Definitely.
What is a sad sack?
A loser.
You like losers?
Very much so.
Do you know what's the major problem in social life?
What?
The tendency, widespread, to always seek someone cooler than yourself.
It's always a stretch.
Often a big stretch.
Why not find someone who's inferior?
Someone like Frank.
Yes.
It's more rewarding.
And, in fact, quite reassuring.
You mean someone you can help, not just thinking of yourself.
Yes, that's it, precisely.
But without the goody-goody implications.
Our aspirations are pretty basic.
Take a guy who hasn't realised his full potential or doesn't even have much, and then help him realise it or find more.
There's enough material here for a lifetime of social work.
What's really worrisome is that that was intentional.
Frank.
Mm.
Frank, this is Lily.
She's just come to Seven Oaks as a transfer student.
Isn't she great?
Lily failed or wasn't happy at her last school.
We're sure that she's going to adapt here.
In fact, she already has.
Oh, good.
# Another night Another dream #
Oh, my God.
A golden oldie.
I love these.
# Another night Another dream but always you #
# In the night I dream of love So true #
# Just another night Another vision of love #
# You feel joy, you feel pain 'Cause nothing will be the same #
# Just another night Is all that it tak es #
# To understand the difference Between lovers and fak es #
# So baby, I talk, talk I talk to you #
# In the night in your dream Of love so true #
# I talk, talk I talk to you #
Oh, my gosh.
Wasn't that great?
That was really fun.
I know that people can have useful careers in many areas.
Medicine, government, law, finance.
Education.
Yes, even education.
But I'd like to do something especially significant in my lifetime.
That could change the course of human history.
Such as starting a new dance craze.
Really?
Yes.
Something that could improve the lives of every person and every couple.
# That seems to be true Another night ##
I'm so proud of what you accomplished last night.
You showed those guys a really good time.
Without anything really bad happening.
That's good.
The guys you know, are they all Greeks?
What?
Are all the guys you know Greeks?
Excuse me.
I don't understand.
Are all the guys you know Greeks?
I don't think we know any Greeks.
Greeks, like frat boys.
Oh, yes.
Fraternities.
You mean members of the Greek-letter fraternities.
Yeah.
Like last night.
Actually, last night we were at the DU house.
DU.
Roman letters.
Not Greek.
Seven Oaks has never had a Greek-letter fraternity system.
It's always been a Roman-letter system here.
It's very different.
What house is this?
Oh, this isn't a fraternity.
At least not one anyone should want to join.
You probably think we're frivolous, empty-headed college coeds.
You're probably right.
I often feel empty-headed.
We're trying to make a difference in people's lives.
One way to do that is to stop them from killing themselves.
Have you ever heard of "Prevention is nine-tenths the cure"?
Well, in the case of suicide, it's actually 10-tenths the cure.
Those are clichés, aren't they?
Yes, they are.
It's interesting you say that.
I love clichés and hackneyed expressions.
Do you know why?
No.
Because they're largely true.
The hundreds, perhaps thousands, of such clichés and hackneyed expressions that our language has bequeathed us are a stunning treasure trove of human insight and knowledge.
Really?
Yes.
Oh, please sit down.
During these formative college years, we should learn as many clichéd and hackneyed thoughts as possible.
Furthermore, I think we will.
Speaking of suicide prevention, do you have a boyfriend, Lily?
Are you dating anyone?
I don't see the connection.
You don't?
Boyfriends are a primary suicide risk.
You don't have any particular friend?
No one at all?
No.
Well, there's this grad student I met over summer.
Xavier.
We became pretty good pals.
He has a girlfriend whom I've met.
She's very nice.
"Zavier. " With a Z?
No, I think it's with an X. No, I'm certain it's Z.
Zavier, like Zorro.
It's the same sound.
Zorro marked his name with a Z.
It's an X.
But Zorro's with a Z.
Okay, let me see if I can figure this out.
Used at the beginning of a name, Z and X have the same pronunciation.
But it's Zorro with a Z. Actually, there were two Zorros.
One spelled his name with a Z and made a Z mark for Zorro.
And there's Xorro who spelled his name with an X, and with his sword he'd make an X mark.
What was really unfair was because he marked his name with X, everybody assumed he was illiterate when he was spelling correctly.
Hello.
Can we help you?
Of course we can.
No case is too challenging.
Would you like a doughnut?
Okay.
Please, sit down.
Here, have some coffee.
Thank you.
What's your name?
Jim Bose.
But my friends call me Jimbo.
Why?
What?
Why do your friends call you Jimbo?
Well, it's a contraction of Jim and the first part of my last name, Bose.
Yeah, I got that.
But why bother?
What do you mean?
Jim is already a lovely name.
It's short, simple, evocative.
Shouldrt a nickname simplify the name that it replaces?
Jimbo doesn't really simplify anything.
I don't know.
Well, maybe you should ask your friends.
Where do you live or reside?
Doar Dorm.
Ugh.
Oh, my God.
Yuck.
What?
The smell, it's notorious.
What smell?
You're right, it's more like a stink.
Unclean clothing, I'd say, mostly.
Vomit.
Stale beer.
Pot.
Cheap deodorant.
There might be a vermin infestation.
Did you know a good-smelling environment is crucial to our sense of well-being?
Have you tried to find a better-smelling place?
Wait, wait.
It's not me, I'm not depressed.
You're not?
No.
Are you sure?
You kind of seem on edge.
No, I'm fine.
That's a terrible expression. "Fine. "
"I'm fine. " Something smug about it. "I'm fine. "
Why do you say that you're fine?
I'm not depressed.
I'm not suicidal.
Why are you here, then?
Are you a con man?
A confidence trickster?
No, there's a girl.
Her boyfriend dumped her.
She was crying but now is silent.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you say so?
We have to go.
Call the cops!
A suicide might be in progress!
The campus cops?
Yes, of course the campus cops.
Take this.
We have a lot of students coming to the centre pretending to be depressed to get doughnuts.
Confidence tricksters.
Yes, it's really bad.
Really cynical.
We pledged to the doughnut company, we would only give doughnuts to students who were depressed or otherwise nutty.
We're a nonprofit, so the rules are pretty strict.
This man could still be a trickster.
Well, we'll soon find out.
Tell me about this girl.
Well, ahem, her name is Priss.
She's very pretty.
Oh, yes.
It's very hard for beautiful women to experience rejection.
Priss?
Priss.
Are you okay?
Priss!
Priss, say something!
Priss!
Open up!
Oh, thank God.
We're gonna have to force this door.
Priss?
Are you okay?
What?
Please don't.
Please, come with us.
Do you wanna talk about it?
What was his name?
Josh.
If you'd rather not talk, we don't have to.
No, it's okay, I just...
I keep thinking how he used to gaze at me with such love in his eyes.
You know what I mean?
No.
No, I've never actually seen that.
Yes.
Just days ago, he'd gaze at me.
His eyes, so blue.
He had blue eyes?
So does Frank.
Frank's the guy that I go out with.
Otherwise, he's not conventionally good-looking, which I actually prefer.
Would you describe Josh as handsome?
That's a problem.
Could I join you guys?
Yes, please.
Priss and I were just talking.
In my view, handsome men are to be avoided.
I don't even consider good looks to be flattering in a man.
Do you know what I mean?
No.
Cookie-cutter, good-looking guys, with their chiselled features, running around, full of themselves, getting everything they want, never suffering or experiencing...
We suffered?
We're not under discussion.
That's irrelevant.
That's besides the point.
Is this making you feel any better?
Yes.
I think so.
Good.
I hoped it would.
Okay, it's nearly 4 and The Daily Complainer's orientation meeting is about to start and I think we should go.
The editor, Rick DeWolfe, he's terrible.
A real jerk.
Why do you think he's such a jerk?
He's one of those that I was talking about.
Tall.
Probably considers himself very smart and handsome.
A journalist, so you can imagine the mindboggling arrogance and conceit.
But, Violet, don't you think...?
What?
Well, don't you think that the way you talk could be considered arrogant too?
I mean, a little?
Yes, of course.
But what's your point?
Wouldrt that be hypocritical, criticising Rick for something you could be criticised for yourself?
No.
I don't see why.
We're all flawed.
Must that render us mute to the flaws of others?
Must we tether ourselves from comment because our natures are human too?
We've got a rebel amongst us.
That's good, I think.
It's good to be challenged and criticised.
I know your intentions are good, it's just...
That's it precisely.
Our intentions are good.
We're seeking to help people rescue their lives from terrible sadness and failure, which is a won'thy goal, don't you think?
Yes.
But not exactly a humble one.
No.
I agree with you there.
You're right, absolutely.
I'd like to thank you for this chastisement.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to chastise.
No, I think you did, and I think it's good.
It's good to have a friend to put one in one's place when that's what one needs.
Now I see that I have that kind of friend in you.
I think that's great.
Hello, people.
Listen up.
People, quiet.
Quiet, people.
Shut up!
Ha-ha-ha.
Okay, that's better.
I'm Rick DeWolfe, editor of The Complainer.
Over the next weeks, I'm the person you're gonna hate most in the world.
You're gonna hate me because I'm gonna work you, point out your stupidity and incompetence, and do everything in my power to turn you into journalists.
Albeit barely literate ones.
Oh, brother.
Any questions?
No?
Yes.
How did The Daily Complainer get its name?
Hmm.
Isn't that pretty obvious?
Heh-heh.
Um, it comes out every day and it's the university daily.
So The Daily Complainer.
The Daily...
No, I meant...
Oh, you mean, why The Complainer?
The name dates from Seven Oaks' earliest days as a divinity school.
The reference is to the Book of Job.
Job's complaint with the world.
Before justice can be achieved, a complaint must be made.
That is what we do and people don't like it a bit.
Right now, what that means is extirpating Seven Oaks' elitist Roman Letter Clubs that are like a cancer on the community.
They're not elitist in the least.
Yes, they are.
Have you met any of their members?
The guys from the DU, for example?
They're barely competent for the tasks of everyday life.
They have to drink a quart of beer just to talk to a woman?
Two quarts.
Yet you salivate at the idea of taking the roof off their heads and throwing them on the street where who knows what would happen.
You call yourself a Christian.
No, I don't.
What unkindness and cruelty.
This is the darkness in the heart of man, which Joseph Conrad wrote about most eloquently.
Ooh.
He was actually Polish.
Oh, my God.
Unkind, self-righteous and pedantic.
In short, a model journalist.
You should know something about these girls.
They run the suicide centre where their preferred therapy for depressed and suicidal people is tap dancing.
I kid you not.
Tap is a highly effective therapy, as well as a dazzlingly expressive dance form that has been sadly neglected for too many years.
It's moronic and barbaric.
You expect tap dancing to solve people's problems?
No, we don't.
We're using the whole range of musical dance numbers which have proven themselves to be effective therapies for the suicidal and the hopelessly depressed.
That really got me down.
I thought you handled it well.
You did?
Thanks.
No, it's all this aggression and hostility that gets me down.
Not just his but also my own.
It leaves you feeling unclean.
Have you thought of taking a shower?
Maybe you'd feel better.
You're probably right.
No, there's something else.
What Lily was saying about me being conceited and arrogant.
I'm sorry.
No, I think you're right.
I'm really ashamed.
You're joking.
No, it's terrible how I've acted.
We're all Christians.
Or I should say Judeo-Christians.
Humility should be our watchword.
The essence of being a good person.
Humility comes from within.
If it's not there in the first place, where do you go to get it?
I stopped looking a long time ago.
Very good, Freak.
You really think so?
Yes.
Certainly.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Violet.
Is it such a good idea to call him Freak?
What?
He's already depressed and you're calling him Freak.
That's his name.
Freak.
Freak Astaire.
That's how he wants to be called.
What are you talking about?
Lily was just saying she likes your dancing.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Are you okay?
What do you mean?
I thought you looked sad and was wondering if there was anything we could do.
What could you do?
Oh, I know.
You think I'm gonna kill myself and make you look bad.
No, I'm worried that you'll kill yourself and make yourself look bad.
Do you have any idea how demoralising it is to be constantly questioned about whether you're suicidal or not?
No.
After a while, you wonder, why is everyone asking me this?
They want me to be suicidal?
Or is it just the consequence of your utter absurdity?
Excuse me.
What scent are you wearing?
What are you talking about?
The perfume you're wearing.
I'm not wearing any perfume!
You see, that could be the problem.
I've become friends with a group.
Really?
Although they're perfume-obsessed.
Oh, them?
Those girls?
The ones who volunteer at the centre?
Yeah.
But they're terrible.
The blond one?
She's notorious.
What do you mean?
Such a bitch.
Terrible, isn't she?
Would balsamic be okay?
What?
Balsamic vinegar.
For the dressing.
Oh.
Yeah, sure.
What's that?
What?
Those.
Artichokes?
Is that what they look like?
Come on, Lily.
You've seen an artichoke before.
You haven't?
They look so weird.
I'm not convinced that having a suicide-prevention centre prevents any suicides.
Well, the coffee's good.
If someone were determined to destroy themselves,
I don't think they'd stop for coffee.
It depends on what it tastes like.
Where are we going?
I thought I'd take Priss over to DU.
Why?
It might be helpful for her to meet some of the guys.
How would that be helpful?
They're morons.
Oh, come on, Lily.
No, they're morons.
No.
Not medically.
I like them.
They're in that sympathetic range of being not good-looking and yet not smart.
There's something likeable about that.
Spending time with them, you get the sense that you're making a difference.
For somebody suicidal, like Priss, that could be a real boost.
I'm not suicidal.
Oh, that's good.
It's better not to have an identity as a suicidal person, don't you think?
Well, uh, bye.
Well...
Where are you going?
Over to Xavier's.
Is that a good idea?
Why wouldn't it be?
Is his girlfriend gonna be there?
Of course.
Gosh, you're nosy.
No, no, it's just a general foreboding.
"Foreboding"?
You know, you're absolutely right.
I was being nosy.
Terribly so.
I've gotta watch that.
Yes, we must improve ourselves.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Lily.
You were coming over?
Hey.
Yeah.
Is Alice home?
Alice is working.
Oh, she is?
But it's not a problem.
It's good you came.
Let's go to the Oak Bar.
I'll buy you a beer.
I thought Alice would be back.
I'll call her.
She'll join us there.
Come on.
Okay.
She's actually quite a good person.
Her entire identity revolves around helping people.
You really think that's true?
What's she have against The Complainer?
That's bizarre.
Well, she thinks the editor, Rick DeWolfe, is completely egotistical.
And your friend isn't?
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, Lily.
Hi.
Great.
You got the message.
Yeah.
Who's egotistical?
Lily's roommate.
She sounds unbearable.
She's on a rampage against The Complainer.
Really?
Why?
She thinks the editor, Rick DeWolfe, is conceited.
And, in fact, quite mean.
Mean?
Yes.
He wants to close the Seven Oaks Roman Letter Clubs.
That's good, isn't it?
Everyone was against them.
No.
Come on.
There's no justification for those places.
They're exclusive and elitist.
The point that Violet makes is that they can't be elitist.
They're morons.
Yeah, elitist morons.
You'll grant they're morons.
That's a handicap.
Such people should be helped, not hounded and persecuted.
Persecuted?
Yes, losing the roof over your head?
That's the worst thing that can happen.
Violet thinks there could be some risk of suicide.
Because some boy might kill himself, Seven Oaks can't do what's right?
It's a factor to be considered.
Yeah.
No, it isn't.
You can't set policy that way.
Excuse me, we didn't order these.
Compliments of the guy at the bar.
That's a playboy or operator move.
Operators like that are to be avoided.
Why?
It seems generous, sending drinks to people you don't know.
Drinks are expensive.
Drinks to two gorgeous girls.
His intention was to seduce and he assumed he could.
Both?
That seems a bit harsh.
You don't know what he was thinking.
Was he alone?
Yes.
You see?
He was alone and probably lonely.
He could see that Alice and Lily were students.
Students are known for their intelligent conversation.
They can always talk about their courses.
That was probably what attracted him.
Nonsense.
Perhaps his view was even loftier.
To court Lily with a view to matrimony.
We're in the north, but a southern gentleman can wander into these parts.
Rubbish.
Seeing Lily across a crowded bar filled with the usual undergraduate slobs.
Why wouldn't a thoughtful young man seek her out?
She's lovely.
Isn't it incumbent on men and women to find ways to meet each other?
Buying drinks for a person you don't know seems to be a generous one.
Yes.
Most guys won't even pay for the women they do know.
What you've described is a playboy or operator move.
I'll grant you that it's a tactic or perhaps even a ruse, but without some of that, would our species even survive?
The Lord said, "Be fruitful and multiply. "
Oh, my gosh.
No, this is how the world works, seeing someone across a room.
This could be the romantic story you tell your grandchildren.
And if you do marry and have children, then he'll really learn how to squander cash.
Isn't it good to know that he's basically generous from the start?
Where's Priss?
Your eyes are so striking.
So blue.
Really?
They're blue?
Yes.
The most piercing blue.
You must know your eyes are blue.
No.
What do you mean?
What?
Heh.
You must know what colour your eyes are.
Your eyes are very blue.
You know that.
I'm not gonna go around checking what colour my eyes are.
When you look in the mirror, you see that your eyes are blue.
Oh, come on.
What?
I don't think my eyes have a colour.
If my eyes are so blue looking out, wouldn't everything be kind of blue?
Like, have a bluish tinge to it?
Doesrt.
Just looks normal.
That's...?
That's blue?
That colour?
Yes, of course.
Then what colour is that?
Green.
You're saying that chair's green but Frank's eyes are blue?
Yes.
Then what colour are the walls?
Also green.
Huh.
You didn't know that?
No.
How's that possible?
You think knowing the colours is so important?
You're in college and you don't know the colours?
Doesrt that embarrass you?
Well, no.
Why should it?
That's why the 'rents are paying big bucks to send me here.
You know, to learn stuff.
Well, gotta go hit the books.
I don't think anyone should feel embarrassed about not knowing stuff.
What's embarrassing is pretending to know.
Or putting people down because you think they don't know as much.
Look, I'm happy to admit I'm completely ignorant.
That's why I'm here and plan to really hit the books.
So the next time you see me, I will know more than I do now.
I'll be older but also wiser.
Or at least know more stuff.
For me, that's education.
Cheers.
Thor's great.
He's very clear about his objectives.
He really wants to learn things.
Frank?
What a jerk.
He's a monster.
Oh, my gosh, Violet.
You did everything for them.
They're nothing without you.
What a rat.
He's a moron.
Don't waste a tear on that creep.
Don't waste a single breath.
Jerk.
Stop.
Please.
What?
I love Frank.
I love him.
Come on, Violet, Frank's a moron.
You are well rid of him.
Don't say that.
Frank's not a moron?
You know, Lily, you're a bit harsh.
This obsession with intelligence.
Do you think it has some magical quality transforming everything?
The intelligence line is not an immutable barrier.
Love can cross it.
You can love someone whose mental capacity is not large.
I know.
I have.
Well, there's a mutable barrier, then.
Frank's stupid, we knew.
That he's a rat playboy operator, I hadrt realised.
I don't want to turn bitter.
I worry for Frank.
I care about him.
Well, I'd stop.
No.
I love Frank.
I always will.
If that's the case, why not fight for him?
Against Priss?
I'd never win.
Sure you would.
Priss is a rat.
A bitch.
A rat bitch.
Don't blame Priss.
She was crushed when her blue-eyed Josh left her.
I should've known.
Of course she'd fall for Frank.
Josh and Frank are both blue-eyed heartbreakers.
Poor Violet.
She's the roommate who's so self-confident?
Yeah.
But now she's a wreck.
But there's no logic to the algebra of love.
"The algebra of love. " Mm-hm.
That sounds like the title to some lame book.
It's a title, but the book's not lame at all.
Love's algebra?
I thought it was more geometry.
Okay, the title's not good, but the book is.
What's it say?
Well, that while we're all perverse in our romantic preferences, there's actually this logic or algebra to our perversity, and it has something to do with how the species has evolved.
The survival of the species?
Yes.
And whether it will continue to do so.
No booze?
Just to find the nearest package store, you had to drive 40 miles.
These aren't so strong.
No, they're really strong.
I think I'd like another.
That wouldn't be a good idea.
Why not?
Well...
Are you trying to stifle me?
Lily?
Oh, hi.
Listen, we're gonna get something to eat.
Why don't you come with us?
I'm with Charlie.
I can see that.
But you really should come.
Why?
I just think it would be a good idea.
But why?
You really must come.
I insist.
Lily?
Lily?
Lily, are you angry?
Lily, this is it.
We're here.
What's the matter?
That was so rude.
He's a nice guy and you embarrassed him.
He's not nice.
He was trying to get you drunk.
No, he wasn't.
Plying you with martinis?
I was plying myself with martinis.
Come on, the guy's a total sleaze.
A creep.
You don't know anything about him.
The way he sent drinks over to our table?
Alice.
Alice, what's wrong?
I had no idea that Xavier could be so mean.
Sounds as if he was just trying to protect you.
This Charlie Walker sounds like an operator or playboy type.
No, he's not like that.
He's actually a really nice guy.
I thought he was a slick businessman.
No.
He dresses well, but he works in strategic development.
What?
Strategic development.
He works at SDA.
Strategic Development Associates.
He's an associate there.
What he is, is a strategic operator.
Violet, are you okay?
Hey, miss, rairs coming!
Better get back!
Polly, have you seen Violet?
No.
Is something wrong?
We're not sure.
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
Oh, my gosh, what happened?
I don't understand.
What were you doing?
How long were you gone for?
I'm sorry, I don't know.
I lost track of time.
But you feel better now?
Well, cleaner.
She'll say anything to get in the show.
She'll want doughnuts.
You don't have to be suicidal to get doughnuts, just depressed.
Clinically depressed.
From a clinic.
Would you say you're depressed?
I don't like the term.
I prefer to say I'm in a tailspin.
Oh, my God.
A tailspin?
She can't even say she's depressed.
She's gotta say something special.
Priss was honest.
She was depressed and she had a right to be in the show.
Now every silly tailspinner's trying to get in.
The show is for everyone.
No, it isn't, Freak.
To be in the centre's programmes, you have to be clinically depressed.
That means that you've been to a clinic, and they've said that you're depressed.
Have you been to a clinic?
Have you been to a clinic?
Then you're not clinically depressed.
Violet.
Violet.
What is it?
Where are you going?
All I wanted was to make Frank happy.
I had all these plans.
Things we could've done together.
I never even got to tell him.
Hey!
Where all your boyfriends at?
Come on!
They don't wear bikinis.
They're ladies, they wear thongs.
I can't imagine where she could've gone.
Wherever she went, she should be back by now.
How did she seem when you last saw her?
Really sad about Frank.
Still?
Yeah.
How can someone so smart continue mooning over a dope like that?
People aren't exactly as you assume.
The Violet you know bears little resemblance to the girl I met in seventh grade.
You met Violet in seventh grade?
Well, her name wasn't Violet then.
What's your name?
You can tell us your name.
We won't bite.
What's your name?
Tell us.
Are you retarded?
Tell us your name.
Emily Tweeter.
Tweeter?
Like a bird?
That's ridiculous.
Tweeter?
Like a bird?
Not an easy name to have at that age.
Not at any age.
What was she like?
Timid.
Bookish.
Classic scholarship student.
Her parents were writers.
They didn't have a dime.
Finances were the least of her worries.
What do you mean?
Well, she was crazy.
I got stuck rooming with her on a trip when no one else would.
It was awful.
Did she smell bad?
No.
Obsessive cleanliness was part of her insanity.
You were nice to her.
No.
The idea of being nice to weird kids hadrt arrived.
Why was she so unpopular?
Well, she was very strange.
Constantly setting herself odd, repetitive tasks.
Tasks?
For example, on that trip she had with her a little square suitcase.
The idea came into her head she had to move it in a precise pattern over and over again, and if she didn't execute this movement flawlessly 10 times, she'd start over.
Another was to slide her hand across her forehead, trying not to touch her hair or eyebrows on either side, also repeating it 10 times.
Any niggling thought she'd touched the hair, she'd start over.
My God, that is insane.
Why would she do that?
She had the conviction that if she didn't complete these tasks, her parents would die.
Was she Catholic?
No.
But what made the whole thing really sad was that her parents did die.
Oh, my God.
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
Violet?
Violet!
Violet, where are you?
Something's wrong, isn't it, dear?
You mind my asking?
Well, I do mind a little.
Excuse me, Your Highness.
I'm sorry.
It's just kind of awkward to talk about.
No matter.
I hope you haven't come to get run over on the highway.
What do you mean?
Suicides.
They come down from the university.
Jump out in the road.
Get hit by the blind curve.
Hope you're not one of them.
Do I look like one of them?
I don't know.
Maybe.
Messy people, suicides.
Think only of themselves and their own deaths.
Not what comes after.
They leave quite a mess.
Mm-hm.
They don't stick around to clean it up.
Mm-mm.
So you're not one of those depressed students from the university?
I don't like the word "depressed. " I prefer to say that I'm in a tailspin.
A tailspin?
Does this tailspin involve a man?
Yes, it does.
But I'm not as crazy as I was up till yesterday.
Apparently that's due to the salutary effect of scent on the human psyche.
Its importance is, I believe, almost incalculable.
At the motel, I happened to use this soap.
It was provided to me as a courtesy as one of the guests.
That an economical motel would provide such good soap is quite unusual.
The scent is very precise.
Really?
Tell me if it provokes any particular reaction in your psyche.
A state of mind.
Hmm.
I always knew she was unstable.
They're gonna have her photo at the registrar's.
Violet!
Violet!
You're back!
You're okay!
Not really.
Oh, my gosh, Violet, we were so worried.
Why didn't you tell us or leave a note?
I did leave a note.
Would that be a suicide note?
I wouldn't leave without a note.
Where did you go?
I took the train to Villafranca and checked into a motel there.
The Motel 6?
No, the Motel 4.
It's even less expensive.
The Motel 4 in Villafranca?
My God, you really were suicidal.
Why'd you go?
I had to do something.
And you really thought you were gonna find the answer in Villafranca?
I'm not sure what I expected, but I might have found it.
What?
Soap?
This scent and this soap is what gives me hope.
Hello?
Hello?
Is anyone here?
Hello?
Lily?
Hello?
Oh, my gosh.
I couldn't understand where everyone was.
Sorry, I just went out to get some things.
Where's Alice?
Gone.
What do you mean?
Left.
We broke up.
But when you called, you said...
I know, I'm sorry.
I thought it better to tell you in person.
Alice couldn't control her jealousy.
It completely overwhelmed her.
Really?
What was she jealous of?
Come on.
No, what?
You.
After a while, I just couldn't handle it.
Things became impossible.
She was jealous of me?
Of course.
Would it be okay if we watch a film?
Yes.
Um...
What would you like to see?
I thought maybe Truffaut's Baisers v olés.
Stolen Kisses.
Do you know it?
No, is it new?
It's a classic of French New Wave cinema.
I think you'll like it.
But it's in colour?
Yeah.
You don't know Truffaut?
No.
Do you know Godard, À bout de souffle?
Why was Alice so jealous?
What do you think?
She was jealous because Lily's lovely.
I don't know.
They had a lot of problems.
Of course.
You wouldn't break up a happy couple.
What's that?
A note Frank left.
Really?
Recently?
No, when we were together.
Now that most correspondence is electronic, it's rare to be left anything written by hand.
Frank can write by hand?
What is it?
It's not very important.
It's just all I have.
What's it say?
"Out for brewskis.
Back in a giff. "
What's a "giff"?
One of those little motor scooters, isn't it?
I'm sure he meant to write "jiff" with a J. "Back in a jiff. "
But he wrote "giff. "
Could Frank be dyslexic?
No.
Dyslexics are intelligent.
What's that?
Frank's bean ball.
He gave you his bean ball?
Not exactly.
This is an extra.
He thought he'd leave it here just in case he lost his other one.
Gosh, Violet, you've really gotta stop thinking about Frank.
Why?
I don't wanna stop thinking about him.
Recently I had a thought that cheered me up a lot.
Life is like a long, flowing river, and as a long, flowing river, some debris you never expect to see again is almost certain to reappear floating to the surface.
Frank and I may very well be together again one day.
Maybe it'll take years, but somewhere down the line, he's very likely to pop up again, and I'll be there to catch him.
I don't think we've spoken about this.
What?
Have you been to the south of France?
To the walled city of Carcassonne?
I've never been anywhere.
But you've seen pictures of it.
No, I don't think so.
Oh, it's fascinating.
I'd like to visit.
You never studied the Cathars?
They were a religious movement, very idealistic, located mostly in the southwest of France that the Catholic Church repressed.
Oh, my God.
The Catholic Church is, like, always bad.
Ideas can't be killed as easily as people.
Especially such enlightened ones as the Cathars held.
In recent years, more and more people have returned to their beliefs.
So you're a Cathar?
Yes.
I aspire to be.
I'm trying to follow the path the Cathars marked out.
That's so impressive.
I can tell you we didn't have any Cathars back home.
I think you'd be surprised.
In the Cathar view, the highest form of lovemaking avoids procreation entirely.
Sure.
Condoms, right?
Well, according to Cathar ideas, sex with condoms is just a parody of the procreative act.
Mm.
What do you mean?
The standard, cliché form of sexual intercourse is for the man to approach a woman from the front.
Cathar lovemaking, I think you'll find very fulfilling.
I'll be very careful, we'll go slowly.
It'll be a new experience, but one which I think you'll find brings an inexpressible closeness.
Might your drinks-buying friend be around?
It would be great to get complimentary cocktails.
Charlie?
No.
Do you still see him at all?
He calls from time to time.
He does?
Why don't you introduce us?
Why should I introduce you?
Because you know him, and we don't.
So?
"So?"
"So" is probably the unkindest word in the English language.
I can't bear it.
I think it should be outlawed. "So. "
You're crazy.
Come on, Lily, you have Xavier.
You can't keep two guys for yourself.
Guys do that all the time.
We're not guys, fortunately.
It's unconscionable for you not to bring him and introduce us.
Charlie is a friend.
He's a nice guy.
What do you mean?
I hate to think what'd happen if you got your claws into him.
That's outrageous.
We're perfectly nice.
We've met lots of pathetic guys and nothing bad's happened.
Charlie's not pathetic.
Well, all the better, then.
The Roman Holidays will be coming soon.
What's that?
A festival Roman Letter Clubs put on.
A kind of moron jamboree.
The Roman elements are the worship of Bacchus, Beerus and Blotto.
It could've all been so uplifting.
Charlie.
Hey, Charlie.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Have you the day off?
Yeah.
This is my friend Charlie, whom I think I've mentioned.
And, Charlie, these are my roommates.
This is, um...
This is Rose.
And this is Heather.
And Violet.
Charlie works for Strategic Development Associates.
He's an associate there.
You work in strategic development?
You've heard of it?
Of course, yes.
My cousin Jay in Philadelphia works in strategic development.
Something business-related?
Mostly business, but any kind of organisation.
Only businesses pay the big bucks.
Nonprofits and government pay well.
That's how they keep from having profits, by paying lots of money to companies like yours.
Excuse me, but aren't you in Professor Ryars course at the Ed School?
No.
You're not in Professor Ryars Flit Lit course?
No.
Flit Lit?
The dandy tradition in literature.
I'm sure I've seen you there.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm not in any courses at the Ed School.
Good to meet you.
It was great to see you.
Bye.
God, Violet, what was that about?
That guy is definitely in Professor Ryars class.
Not possible.
He has a fulltime job for Strategic Development Associates.
He never got his coffee.
Why lie about something like that?
He's lying.
I find that very attractive.
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna stop cutting Professor Ryars class.
It can be argued that Firbank was too little disciplined, too unserious in his unseriousness to create works of enduring value.
But as a liberating influence on later writers such as Waugh, his importance should not be discounted.
It's not Firbank's work itself but the idea of his work that so helped later writers as Thomas Love Peacock did in the previous century.
I'm not gonna come anymore.
What a waste of time.
Charlie.
Charlie.
Charlie?
Charlie, you are taking the course.
Charlie?
Who's Charlie?
Fred, what's going on?
Fred?
Uh-oh.
Fred.
Sounds like you got some explaining to do.
Well, you were lying.
I wasn't lying, I was making it up.
Why were you making it up?
If you were an eighth-year Ed School student, would you advertise that?
Eighth year.
Impressive.
But your whole life was a lie.
Dressing up in suits.
Buying people drinks.
The suits were real.
The drinks, real.
Not just drinks for people.
They were for cute girls.
There's a perfectly rational, easily explainable agenda.
So it was a playboy or operator move.
Of course.
Transparently so.
I admire that.
Drinks are expensive.
But strategic development, that was made up too?
You said your cousin Jay was in it.
What cousin Jay?
In Philadelphia.
I don't have a cousin in Philadelphia.
You said your cousin Jay was working in strategic development.
I was just saying that to be friendly.
To make a kind of link.
So your name's Fred something?
Yes.
Fred something.
Packenstacker?
Oh, my God.
How crazy.
He's completely insane.
I almost dated him.
You can say that about a lot of guys.
I don't think he's crazy.
Making up an entirely fictitious identity, that's not crazy?
It's insane.
It's psycho.
Violet's identity is made up.
I don't think she's crazy.
No, I am.
No, this is different.
It's crazy and pathetic.
All that about strategic development he just made up.
Don't tell me that's not weird.
I've heard of strategic development.
I think it's something pretty important.
Violet, you're not gonna start going out with him.
You're not, are you?
Well, we had planned to go to the library.
Not to the stacks, I hope.
Yes.
Oh, my gosh, do you realise how dangerous that is?
Dangerous?
Yes, the stacks.
They're dark and deserted.
Anything could happen.
It's true.
With the study habits at Seven Oaks, your body won't be found until spring.
Promise you won't go with him to the stacks.
Please.
Okay.
I'll suggest the Randall Room.
Don't suggest.
Insist.
And please not at night.
Okay.
What are you reading?
Have you chosen a topic for your final paper?
The decline of decadence.
You think that decadence has declined?
Definitely.
Bigtime.
Major, major decline.
How?
How or in what ways?
Either.
Well, take the flit movement in literature, or homosexuality.
It's gone completely downill, right down the tubes.
Poof!
What do you mean?
Before, homosexuality was something refined, hidden, aspiring to the highest levels of creativity and often achieving it.
Now it seems to be musclebound morons running around in T-shirts.
It's pretty disillusioning.
Are you gay?
Not especially, but in another era, it might have had some appeal.
Now I just don't see the point.
You might be romanticising the past.
We'll never know.
The past is gone, so we might as well romanticise it.
Hmm.
You could be right.
I wanted to ask, how's Lily?
Lily.
She's okay.
Here, check it out.
A.L.A. Nope.
Hello.
Good afternoon.
Check it out.
The A.L.A. Heard of it?
We have a meeting on Tuesday.
You should come by.
What is the A.L.A.?
Oh.
Just join us.
Come Tuesday.
I think you'll really like it.
So...
A fellow was passing these out, and invited us to a meeting on Tuesday.
The A.L.A.?
Oh, my God.
I thought it was something related.
No?
The A.L.A. Has got nothing to do with us.
Can't you see that?
The way we express love has meaning.
It's in the context of something beautiful.
We're following our creator's teaching.
Aspiring to an ideal.
A beautiful one that brings an inexpressible closeness.
Not just to each other, but...
For the A.L.A., and those like them, the love act is just hedonistic pleasure-seeking of a perverted nature.
I can't believe you'd think we had anything in common with them.
We don't.
Nothing, not an iota.
My God, can't you see that?
Lily.
Lily, come back.
Please.
Don't be that way.

Oh, my gosh, Lily.
Are you okay?
It's all right.
You don't wanna talk about it?
I don't understand.
You don't understand what?
What is non-procreative lovemaking?
It could be a lot of things.
Yeah, but in this case?
We don't have to talk about this.
I don't mind.
Could somebody explain what this is about?
Well, if...
Cathars don't believe in procreative sex.
They don't have intercourse the usual way.
The usual way?
You don't have to talk about this.
No, it's okay.
It's the normal way, from the front where you can have procreation, not from the other side, where you can't.
The other side?
That's their religion?
No, but it's the direction their beliefs head in.
When they express love, that's what they do.
Wow.
How horrible.
You poor girl.
What?
That's terrible, what he obliged Lily to do.

Of course Priss.

Depressed.

She was so depressed, she had to get everything her own way.
"I'm so stressed.
Frantic. "
Man.
What a bitch.
Priss dumped you?
No.
It was mutual.
Oh, listen, I have a question.
You remember that bean ball that I left in your room?
Yeah.
Do you still have it?
Yeah.
Do you think I could get it back?
I lost the other one, and with everything that's happened,
I'd really like to have it.
Nothing like some bean ball after a breakup.
Yeah.
God, you're smart.
You always get it.

Violet, what's wrong?
I'm sorry.
Lily's lovely.
Now she's free.
Go.
I understand.
Latin!
Et cetera!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Ha-ha!
This is what comes from not teaching Latin in the schools.
Yeah, it's moronic and boorish, but it's also kind of fun, don't you think?
No.
What's that stench?
I suppose this is what happens when decadence rots society from within.
And from without.
Such a society is, I fear, destined to fail and be overrun.
Maybe that's good.
Finally.
It's about time those cesspools were drained.
What colour would you say that chair is?
That's a chair?
I have no idea.
Guys have preferences.
You're going to accept that?
You're not going to do anything?
There's nothing to be done.
Fred must know his own mind.
Oh, really?
I seriously doubt that.
Come on.
Lily's got that slender, delicately swelling beauty that no man can resist.
Okay, you're probably right.
Poor Lily.
Just think of all Xavier put her through.
He just used her body.
And not even the right side.
Have you noticed that good people tend to have large posteriors?
Not everyone, by any means.
I know it's not logical.
But it does seem to be true.
The genetic link between morality and large posteriors?
Yes, I think that's well known.
You and Violet have that build.
It's nice.
You're still very attractive, but also sensible and moralistic.
I don't.
I have narrow hips, but also no very strong principles.
Yes?
Oh, hi.
Hi, Frank.
Hey, Heather.
Wow.
So I guess you guys all heard.
University's closing all the Roman Letter Houses.
Sorry.
This year's Roman Holidays did seem like the end of civilisation, but when civilisation ends people are going to need a place to stay.
Man.
It's bad.
It's that bastard from The Complainer.
Someone from the administratiors been reading it.
Hard to believe.
Bastard.
Listen, we were wondering if you thought it would be okay if we stayed at the suicide centre.
Okay, sure.
That sounds like a good stopgap measure.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, um...
So there's one more thing.
Remember that bean ball we talked about?
Yes.
You think I could pick that up?
Just after everything that's happened, it...
I could really use it right now.
Yes.
What's that?
What?
The note.
Oh.
One gets so few things written by hand anymore, I guess I kept it.
"Out for brewskis, back in a giff. "
What's a giff?
It's the scooter.
Like a Vespa, right?
That's what I thought.
I was thinking about getting one.
You must've meant "jiff. " "Back in a jiff. "
And then misspelled it, or spelled it in a nonstandard way.
Oh...
Heh.
Yeah.
Not a good speller.
Mm.
Thanks.
You're great.
Priss was such a bitch.
Damn.
Ha-ha.
Damn.
Hey, Heather.
Bye.
Bye.
Ha-ha.
Bye.
Bye.
Wow.
Heather is really cute.
She, um, going out with anyone?
There might be something between her and Thor.
Thor?
Damn.
Heather and Thor?
Damn.
I'm worried about Thor.
It's hard for us to imagine how upsetting it is not knowing the colours.
It's impossible for me to imagine.
When Thor sees a rainbow, it's so much gibberish to him.
There was one this afternoon.
Oh, my gosh, he took it hard.
Recently, there was a parade in the city where the marchers carried rainbow-coloured flags and banners.
Thor was so upset.
He had no idea what it meant.
What kind of retard is he?
See, that's the conclusion people jump to.
Well, it is somewhat understandable.
Not if you knew the full story.
What's the full story?
You know how parents love bragging about how precocious their children are?
Thor's parents had become precocity addicts, constantly needing an ever-greater precocity fix.
He should've entered kindergarten.
They pushed him into first grade.
"Thor skipped a grade," they could tell.
What Thor's parents failed to consider is the work done in nursery school.
Key being the study of colours.
I suppose they just assumed that colours are knowledge people pick up.
Like, for example, not stepping on sidewalk cracks.
What's that?
I think Rose is sleeping.
Am I boring?
No, not at all.
When you have problems, it's great to hear someone else's idiotic ones.
Please go on.
Wow.
What?
What you said about depressed people being mean, you werert joking.
I'm sorry, you're right.
Please go on.
No.
I'm sorry.
You know how I am.
Please continue.
Thor decided he absolutely had to learn all the colours.
Both primary and mixed.
He's been hitting the books hard, and thought he'd mastered them.
Then, in town, he said, "That traffic light's blue. "
I had to say, "No, it's green. "
He was really upset.
Oh, hi, Lily.
Hi.
We were worried about you.
I can't bear this tension with Lily.
It's terrible to have the group divided this way.
Better not next to Robertson.
What?
Didrt you hear?
Ed students have been going up to the roof and throwing themselves off.
But it's only two storeys.
Yes, I know.
It's terrible.
Not high enough to kill, but high enough to maim.
And particularly dangerous for anyone below.
I've got to forget about Fred.
But you really liked him.
This whole thing of a person meeting someone else first, it's so arbitrary.
It's terrible and cruel.
I have to say, I was wrong about Fred.
I thought he was a playboy or operator type.
In fact, he's just another guy rendered helpless by the attentions of a pretty girl.
Cary!
No, don't!
I love you!
Why did you do that?
Oh, my God!
Cary, I love you!
Isn't the Ed School essentially a teacher's college?
Yeah.
If they can't even destroy themselves, how are they going to teach America's youth?
# It's just that my happiness Finally commences #

What do you think you're doing?
Sorry.
Did I disturb you?
Why are you wearing tap shoes?
You out of your mind?
I think that's pretty clear.
I'm so sick of that.
Oh, really?
I think it's cute.
Since you won't be treating us to one of your incompetent tap routines, why don't you take those things off?
No.
We'll do the routine.
Rose.
Madge wants to see the routine.
I don't want to see your routine.
I asked you to take those off.
We need a break.
Just briefly, please.
It's helpful to have an audience.
Rose, the music.
I'm gonna report you.
Suzanne.
For me, it'd be Madame Curie, Simone de Beauvoir, and Margaret Sanger.
Good.
Violet.
I would say
Richard Strauss, Roderick Charleston, and Chubbard Checker.
Richard Strauss?
The composer?
Yes, that was one of his posts.
I'm not familiar with the others.
Could you tell us who they are?
Yes.
Each one of these men started an international dance craze.
Richard Strauss, the waltz.
Roderick Charleston, the Charleston.
Chubbard Checker, known as Chubby, the dance we know as the twist.
Why do you consider a dance craze important?
Dance crazes enance and elevate the human experience, bringing together millions of people in a joyous celebration of our God-given faculties, and passing these modes of physical expression down through the generations.
Though not so much anymore.
I thought...
Well, I assumed that the Charleston was named after the city of Charleston.
No.
Though that misconception is quite widely held.
It was Roderick Charleston.
Usually, behind some great creative phenomenon, there's a person, not a town.
This is so exciting.
It's really great, isn't it?
Hey, could you guys help?
Sure.
What's up?
We need help packing soap, which we'll distribute to Doar Dorm residents.
Cool.
What would you say are effective means to fight depression?
Maybe some of your DU brothers have an idea?
Uh...
Beer?
No.
Beer's a downer.
Cocktails.
Hard liquor and spirits is what really gives you a lift.
It's interesting what you say.
My cousin Jay is a medical officer in Philadelphia.
He says that alcoholism, by which I mean chronic, excessive consumption of alcohol, is the primary self-administered treatment for depression.
Cool.
No.
It leaves you much worse off than before.
Oh, no, not me.
I just boot and then I feel fine.
By "boot" do you mean vomit?
Yes.
No.
None of the effective anti-suicide treatments involve vomiting.
Hygiene?
Exactly.
It's very important.
That's why we have such hope in the wonder bar.
Do you know its scent?
Wow.
Transformative, we think.
This is so exciting.
When should we go over there?
I don't think there's any rush.
I'd like to go soon.
Doar Dorm has the highest fatality rate, as well as the worst hygiene.
Highest suicide rate.
Fatality rate.
It's uncertain what percentage were intentional and how many were just due to unawareness of gravity's laws.
I can just see those guys getting the gold packages, opening them, and finding the good-smelling soap inside.
The cute packaging should prove irresistible.
And once clean, they'll start to see the world with new eyes.
The change could be dramatic.
Doar Dorm could soon become Dior Dorm.
I doubt that, to be perfectly, absolutely honest.
I love the idea.
Dior Dorm.
I adore optimism, even when it's completely absurd.
Perhaps especially then.
Great.
Ready?
Let's go.
Let's hurry.
Let's not get our hopes up too high, Heather.
No, you said yourself, the wonder bar is transformative.
Hey, Violet.
Hi.
Hi.
Where you going?
Doar Dorm.
Fred, hi.
Hey.
Good one.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
I guess it wasn't realistic to expect Doar Dorm to turn into Dior Dorm overnight.
They wouldn't even open them.
They said without the soap, the discs wouldn't fly properly.
Are you coming Friday?
Violet's launching her dance craze.
Oh, really?
That's great.
What's the dance?
The Sambola.
The devil's dance.
Oh, cool.
We'll go, right?
Yes, I'd like to.
But I have several papers to finish.
But I'd like to.
Great.
Thanks, Gus.
I don't see how we're going to start a dance craze if no guys show up.
Most guys aren't very good with the dance-craze thing.
Very good news.
I was just in my procrastination seminar and the two guys from Doar Dorm had showered.
It was clear they'd used soap.
Oh, my gosh, what a difference.
Seems they'd been throwing packages so energetically, a soap bar fell out.
The unfamiliar ivory-like object intrigued them and one thing led to another, and, well...
It was just as you said.
Isn't that great?
Oh, look, here's Jimbo.
Jimbo doesn't count.
Where is everybody?
Arert we gonna be late for Violet's dance craze?
You wanna go to that?
Yeah.
You're kidding.
No, I love dance crazes.
Gosh, you're strange.
But aren't we already late?
No, it's later on.
Like 10, I think.
I have to confess, I've started losing patience with Violet.
Depression calls for serious treatment.
Medication.
Psychopharmaceuticals.
Talk therapy.
Are those approaches effective?
Despite the medication and therapy,
Ed School students are still throwing themselves off Robertson Hall.
Violet's ideas might seem a little offbeat...
A little?
Oh, my God.
I don't know how much you know about Violet, but there's some pretty weird stuff.
You know, Violet.
Violet Wister.
It's not even her real name.
It isn't?
No, it's Emily Tweeter.
When she was 11, she went completely crazy and has had several relapses since.
So it's a little worrisome to have her counsel nearly suicidal individuals.
I can't believe it.
What?
Emily Tweeter.
In first grade, I had an enormous crush on a girl with that name.
And you remember that?
Yeah.
Pretty huge Dr. Zhivago stuff.
Any idea or even mention of her filled me with emotion.
I had a strange perspective on the world.
I don't think my brain was functioning properly.
Everything was a bit of a dream.
You think this was Violet?
You have any idea if Violet attended Willamette Montessori?
In Portland?
We didn't order these.
Compliments of the guy at the bar.
It was so brutal how it ended between us.
I know I was too angry and a bit crazy, but I thought that what we had was stronger than that.
That you would not just walk away after one disagreement.
It wasn't just that.
Oh.
You mean my Cathar beliefs.
Well, ahem,
I am no longer a Cathar.
How is that possible?
It's been very difficult.
You've dropped your adherence to the Cathar faith?
Yes, I have.
Good.
Heh-heh.
Normally I'd be reluctant to comment on anyone's religion, but...
What?
I'm sorry.
I guess...
I guess I'm a bit of a bigot.
I just...
I could never take seriously any religion that worships on Tuesdays.
Major religions require worship on the weekend.
Friday, Saturday or Sunday.
I find it just really laudatory that people sacrifice their weekend time to worship God.
Having the Sabbath on Tuesday always seemed very bizarre to me.
It's not right.
You know what?
We'd better get to the Lone Star.
Why are you so concerned about that?
Well, it's not as if international dance crazes start every day.
We'd better hurry.
What's wrong?
Another fiasco.
Sometimes our struggle reminds me of the myth of Sisyphus.
Who?
The myth about the guy who pushes an enormous rock only to have it keep rolling back.
Oh, yeah.
What a knucklehead.
The important thing to remember is that he was mythical.
He never really existed.
Violet?
Did you spend any part of your education at Willamette Montessori?
In Oregon?
Why?
Sound like "tweaker. "
Would you say today is very grey?
I'd say so.
Maybe blue-grey.
Yeah, no, that rings a bell now.
Bye.
I'm sorry.
Her name wasn't Emily Tweeter, but Lucy Wurlitzer.
They're not similar.
I'm beginning to realise that the human memory is not the foolproof instrument we sometimes imagine.
What's worse, everyone knew about my obsession, including my parents, those from whom I most wanted it kept.
So from your earliest years, you were already a playboy or operator type?
Yes.
I suppose that's why secrecy seemed so desirable.
Violet, can we talk?
What's the plural of doofus?
Doufi.
Not doofuses?
You can say either.
"Doufi" respects the Latin root and is preferred.
"Doofuses" is also correct, although a bit inelegant.
You've thought a lot about this.
Yes, I've had to.
Mm.
Why?
What is it?
I like Fred, he's a nice guy.
And I can see why you like him.
When I first met you and Rose, I thought you were the cool crowd.
And in many ways you are.
I find your perfume and fashion sense excellent.
Thank you.
But there's a reason, I think, why you are so strongly attracted to... doufi.
And it's not an accident how different groups divide up.
Isn't that a rainbow?
That's a rainbow!
Thor.
No, Thor!
Thor, no!
Stop!
Please, stop!
He's headed for Robertson Hall!
Red.
Orange.
Yellow.
Green.

Hallelujah!
Lord God, thank you.

It's dangerous, parents letting children travel.
They send them off and they don't know what they'll be getting back.
I don't know what you're referring to.
You're not from London.
I'm from London.
I was there, now I'm here.
I'm from London.
I just miss my nice American friend.
Nice?
Nice?
Fine.
I'm fine.
Those are not adjectives I like to use.
God gave us abilities.
He requires that we use them.
Good, better, best, excelsior, higher.
Only excellence can glorify the Lord.
Vulgarity is, in essence, blasphemous.
I'm sorry for what I was saying before.
Of course you're not linked to the doufi, or even that such distinctions are valid.
No, don't apologise.
I probably do have a doufi orientation.
But behind coolness, isn't there a certain repressing, squashing down, or lack of cultivation of one's humanity?
Oh, so you think that cool people have less humanity?
No, I don't think cool people are entirely inuman.
Just enough to be cool.
In our society, there's all this propaganda, in favour of uniqueness, eccentricity, et cetera.
But does the world really want or need more of such traits?
Arert such people usually terrible pains in the neck?
What the world needs to work properly is a large mass of normal people.
I would like to be one of those.
Sorry.
But you'll still do the part?
Yeah, of course.
So do you know every number in every Fred Astaire movie?
There were two in our school musical.
I know those.
Did performing those two numbers help you overcome feelings of discouragement and despair?
Absolutely.
Freak.
# If I should suddenly start to sing #

# Don't think that I've lost my senses #
# It's just that my happiness Finally commences #

- Look.
- Where?
There.
Yes.
I think so.
Hello.
Are you a new student?
- Yes.
- Good.
We thought so.
We'd like to help you.
Help me?
What do you mean?
As a freshman, it can be very tough.
You get to college and it's supposed to be great, but it's not.
University life can be pretty bad.
- There are a lot of suicides.
- Well, attempted ones.
I'm not actually a freshman.
I'm a transfer student.
- Oh, an entering sophomore?
- Yes.
You were unhappy and are looking to recover here.
- Well, I think you will.
- Yes.
Would you welcome that?
Would our help be something you'd appreciate?
Or would you rather sink or swim on your own?
- Either way is fine.
We'll be friends.
- Yes, whichever you'd prefer.
Yes.
Sure.
Great.
We should start immediately.
Clothes can be crucial for confidence and an overall sense of well-being.
- Clothes don't have to be expensive.
- You need friends of the same size.
- You don't like my clothes?
- I'm just saying.
Move it out.
What?
What's wrong?
- What's wrong?
- You didn't notice that?
- No.
What?
- Those guys.
That smell.
That awful, acrid odor.
Have you heard of nasal shock syndrome?
Any harsh, acrid or just disgusting odor sends Rose into nasal shock.
Just from some BO?
"Just some BO"?
Oh, my God, Lily.
You must have a very high threshold for pain.
That'll serve you well at Seven Oaks.
- What do you mean?
- Seven Oaks is notorious for its BO.
It was the last of the Select Seven to go coed.
An atmosphere of male barbarism predominates...
- ...but we're going to change that.
- Yes.
Where are you going?
Gotta get to the Housing Department.
They lost my rooming assignment.
That's terrible.
You have no place to stay?
Was it just mislaid?
No, there were more acceptances than they anticipated... and not enough rooms to go around, so...
Why don't you stay with us?
Really?
Don't think of this in the old-fashioned sense of going to a party... to find someone or not find someone.
That's not the dynamic that we're talking about.
- What dynamic are you talking about?
- Glad you asked.
Our going to a party of this kind is more a form of youth outreach.
- Of what?
- Youth outreach.
It's not just some moronic frat-house social function.
Though it will be that too.
We've gotta keep in mind that these guys are young people.
They're essentially immature and crying out for help and guidance.
- Though they don't know it.
- No, they don't, but we do.
- Aren't they the same age as we are?
- Only numerically.
I'm a lot fatter than you are, but I think we could pin it.
Oh, my gosh, that's beautiful.
Stunning.
Take Frank, my friend.
He's not some cool, handsome, studly macho type.
No, not at all.
I can't stand guys like that.
He's more of a sad sack really, wouldn't you say?
- Definitely.
- What is a sad sack?
A loser.
- You like losers?
- Very much so.
Do you know what's the major problem in social life?
What?
The tendency, widespread, to always seek someone cooler than yourself.
It's always a stretch.
Often a big stretch.
Why not find someone who's inferior?
- Someone like Frank.
- Yes.
It's more rewarding.
And, in fact, quite reassuring.
You mean someone you can help, not just thinking of yourself.
Yes, that's it, precisely.
But without the goody-goody implications.
Our aspirations are pretty basic.
Take a guy who hasn't realized his full potential... or doesn't even have much... and then help him realize it or find more.
There's enough material here for a lifetime of social work.
What's really worrisome is that that was intentional.
Frank.
Frank, this is Lily.
She's just come to Seven Oaks as a transfer student.
Isn't she great?
Lily failed or wasn't happy at her last school.
We're sure that she's going to adapt here.
- In fact, she already has.
- Oh, good.
Oh, my God.
A golden oldie.
I love these.
- Oh, my gosh.
Wasn't that great?
- That was really fun.
I know that people can have useful careers in many areas.
Medicine, government, law, finance.
- Education.
- Yes, even education.
But I'd like to do something especially significant in my lifetime.
That could change the course of human history.
- Such as starting a new dance craze.
- Really?
Yes.
Something that could improve the lives... of every person and every couple.
I'm so proud of what you accomplished last night.
You showed those guys a really good time.
Without anything really bad happening.
That's good.
The guys you know, are they all Greeks?
- What?
- Are all the guys you know Greeks?
Excuse me.
I don't understand.
Are all the guys you know Greeks?
- I don't think we know any Greeks.
- Greeks, like frat boys.
Oh, yes.
Fraternities.
You mean members of the Greek-letter fraternities.
Yeah.
Like last night.
Actually, last night we were at the DU house.
DU.
Roman letters.
Not Greek.
Seven Oaks has never had a Greek-letter fraternity system.
It's always been a Roman-letter system here.
It's very different.
- What house is this?
- Oh, this isn't a fraternity.
At least not one anyone should want to join.
You probably think we're frivolous, empty-headed college coeds.
You're probably right.
I often feel empty-headed.
We're trying to make a difference in people's lives.
One way to do that is to stop them from killing themselves.
Have you ever heard of "Prevention is nine-tenths the cure"?
Well, in the case of suicide, it's actually 10-tenths the cure.
- Those are clichés, aren't they?
- Yes, they are.
It's interesting you say that.
I love clichés and hackneyed expressions.
- Do you know why?
- No.
Because they're largely true.
The hundreds, perhaps thousands... of such clichés and hackneyed expressions... that our language has bequeathed us... are a stunning treasure trove of human insight and knowledge.
- Really?
- Yes.
Oh, please sit down.
During these formative college years... we should learn as many clichéd and hackneyed thoughts as possible.
Furthermore, I think we will.
Speaking of suicide prevention, do you have a boyfriend, Lily?
- Are you dating anyone?
- I don't see the connection.
- You don't?
- Boyfriends are a primary suicide risk.
You don't have any particular friend?
No one at all?
No.
Well, there's this grad student I met over summer.
Xavier.
We became pretty good pals.
He has a girlfriend whom I've met.
She's very nice.
"Zavier." With a Z?
- No, I think it's with an X.
- No, I'm certain it's Z.
Zavier, like Zorro.
It's the same sound.
Zorro marked his name with a Z.
It's an X.
But Zorro's with a Z.
Okay, let me see if I can figure this out.
Used at the beginning of a name, Z and X have the same pronunciation.
- But it's Zorro with a Z.
- Actually, there were two Zorros.
One spelled his name with a Z and made a Z mark for Zorro.
And there's Xorro who spelled his name with an X... and with his sword he'd make an X mark.
What was really unfair was because he marked his name with X... everybody assumed he was illiterate... when he was spelling correctly.
- Hello.
- Can we help you?
Of course we can.
No case is too challenging.
- Would you like a doughnut?
- Okay.
Please, sit down.
- Here, have some coffee.
- Thank you.
- What's your name?
- Jim Bose.
- But my friends call me Jimbo.
- Why?
- What?
- Why do your friends call you Jimbo?
Well, it's a contraction of Jim and the first part of my last name, Bose.
Yeah, I got that.
But why bother?
- What do you mean?
- Jim is already a lovely name.
It's short, simple, evocative.
Shouldn't a nickname simplify the name that it replaces?
Jimbo doesn't really simplify anything.
I don't know.
Well, maybe you should ask your friends.
Where do you live or reside?
Doar Dorm.
- Oh, my God.
Yuck.
- What?
- The smell, it's notorious.
- What smell?
You're right, it's more like a stink.
Unclean clothing, I'd say, mostly.
- Vomit.
- Stale beer.
Pot.
Cheap deodorant.
There might be a vermin infestation.
Did you know a good-smelling environment... is crucial to our sense of well-being?
Have you tried to find a better-smelling place?
Wait, wait.
It's not me, I'm not depressed.
- You're not?
- No.
Are you sure?
You kind of seem on edge.
- No, I'm fine.
- That's a terrible expression. "Fine."
"I'm fine."
Something smug about it. "I'm fine."
- Why do you say that you're fine?
- I'm not depressed.
I'm not suicidal.
Why are you here, then?
Are you a con man?
- A confidence trickster?
- No, there's a girl.
Her boyfriend dumped her.
She was crying but now is silent.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you say so?
We have to go.
Call the cops!
A suicide might be in progress!
- The campus cops?
- Yes, of course the campus cops.
Take this.
We have a lot of students coming to the center... pretending to be depressed to get doughnuts.
- Confidence tricksters.
- Yes, it's really bad.
Really cynical.
We pledged to the doughnut company... we would only give doughnuts to students who were depressed... or otherwise nutty.
We're a nonprofit, so the rules are pretty strict.
- This man could still be a trickster.
- Well, we'll soon find out.
Tell me about this girl.
Well, her name is Priss.
She's very pretty.
Oh, yes.
It's very hard for beautiful women to experience rejection.
Priss?
Priss.
Are you okay?
Priss!
Priss, say something!
Priss!
Open up!
Oh, thank God.
We're gonna have to force this door.
Priss?
Are you okay?
- What?
- Please don't.
Please, come with us.
Do you wanna talk about it?
What was his name?
Josh.
If you'd rather not talk, we don't have to.
No, it's okay, I just...
I keep thinking how he used to gaze at me with such love in his eyes.
You know what I mean?
No.
No, I've never actually seen that.
Yes.
Just days ago, he'd gaze at me.
His eyes, so blue.
He had blue eyes?
So does Frank.
Frank's the guy that I go out with.
Otherwise, he's not conventionally good-looking, which I actually prefer.
Would you describe Josh as handsome?
- That's a problem.
- Could I join you guys?
Yes, please.
Priss and I were just talking.
In my view, handsome men are to be avoided.
I don't even consider good looks to be flattering in a man.
- Do you know what I mean?
- No.
Cookie-cutter, good-looking guys, with their chiseled features... running around, full of themselves... getting everything they want, never suffering or experiencing...
We suffered?
We're not under discussion.
That's irrelevant.
That's besides the point.
- Is this making you feel any better?
- Yes.
I think so.
Good.
I hoped it would.
Okay, it's nearly 4 and The Daily Complainer's orientation meeting... is about to start and I think we should go.
The editor, Rick DeWolfe, he's terrible.
A real jerk.
Why do you think he's such a jerk?
He's one of those that I was talking about.
Tall.
Probably considers himself very smart and handsome.
A journalist, so you can imagine the mindboggling arrogance and conceit.
- But, Violet, don't you think...?
- What?
Well, don't you think that the way you talk could be considered arrogant too?
I mean, a little?
Yes, of course.
But what's your point?
Wouldn't that be hypocritical, criticizing Rick... for something you could be criticized for yourself?
No.
I don't see why.
We're all flawed.
Must that render us mute to the flaws of others?
Must we tether ourselves from comment... because our natures are human too?
We've got a rebel amongst us.
That's good, I think.
It's good to be challenged and criticized.
I know your intentions are good, it's just...
That's it precisely.
Our intentions are good.
We're seeking to help people rescue their lives... from terrible sadness and failure... which is a worthy goal, don't you think?
Yes.
But not exactly a humble one.
No.
I agree with you there.
You're right, absolutely.
I'd like to thank you for this chastisement.
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to chastise.
- No, I think you did... and I think it's good.
It's good to have a friend... to put one in one's place when that's what one needs.
Now I see that I have that kind of friend in you.
I think that's great.
Hello, people.
Listen up.
People, quiet.
Quiet, people.
Shut up!
Okay, that's better.
I'm Rick DeWolfe, editor of The Complainer.
Over the next weeks, I'm the person you're gonna hate most in the world.
You're gonna hate me because I'm gonna work you... point out your stupidity and incompetence... and do everything in my power to turn you into journalists.
- Albeit barely literate ones.
- Oh, brother.
Any questions?
No?
Yes.
How did The Daily Complainer get its name?
Isn't that pretty obvious?
It comes out every day and it's the university daily.
So The Daily Complainer.
- The Daily...
- No, I meant...
Oh, you mean, why The Complainer?
The name dates from Seven Oaks' earliest days as a divinity school.
The reference is to the Book of Job.
Job's complaint with the world.
Before justice can be achieved, a complaint must be made.
That is what we do and people don't like it a bit.
Right now, what that means... is extirpating Seven Oaks' elitist Roman Letter Clubs... that are like a cancer on the community.
They're not elitist in the least.
Yes, they are.
Have you met any of their members?
The guys from the DU, for example?
They're barely competent for the tasks of everyday life.
They have to drink a quart of beer just to talk to a woman?
- Two quarts.
- Yet you salivate at the idea... of taking the roof off their heads and throwing them on the street... where who knows what would happen.
You call yourself a Christian.
- No, I don't.
- What unkindness and cruelty.
This is the darkness in the heart of man, which Joseph Conrad... wrote about most eloquently.
- He was actually Polish.
- Oh, my God.
Unkind, self-righteous and pedantic.
In short, a model journalist.
You should know something about these girls.
They run the suicide center where their preferred therapy for depressed... and suicidal people is... tap dancing.
- I kid you not.
- Tap is a highly effective therapy... as well as a dazzlingly expressive dance form... that has been sadly neglected for too many years.
It's moronic and barbaric.
You expect tap dancing to solve people's problems?
No, we don't.
We're using the whole range of musical dance numbers... which have proven themselves to be effective therapies... for the suicidal and the hopelessly depressed.
That really got me down.
- I thought you handled it well.
- You did?
Thanks.
No, it's all this aggression and hostility that gets me down.
Not just his but also my own.
It leaves you feeling unclean.
Have you thought of taking a shower?
Maybe you'd feel better.
You're probably right.
No, there's something else.
What Lily was saying about me being conceited and arrogant.
- I'm sorry.
- No, I think you're right.
I'm really ashamed.
- You're joking.
- No, it's terrible how I've acted.
We're all Christians.
Or I should say Judeo-Christians.
Humility should be our watchword.
The essence of being a good person.
Humility comes from within.
If it's not there in the first place, where do you go to get it?
I stopped looking a long time ago.
Very good, Freak.
- You really think so?
- Yes.
Certainly.
- Five, six, seven, eight.
- Violet.
Is it such a good idea to call him Freak?
What?
He's already depressed and you're calling him Freak.
That's his name.
Freak.
Freak Astaire.
That's how he wants to be called.
What are you talking about?
Lily was just saying she likes your dancing.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Are you okay?
What do you mean?
I thought you looked sad and was wondering...
- ...if there was anything we could do.
- What could you do?
Oh, I know.
You think I'm gonna kill myself and make you look bad.
No, I'm worried that you'll kill yourself and make yourself look bad.
Do you have any idea how demoralizing it is... to be constantly questioned about whether you're suicidal or not?
No.
After a while, you wonder, why is everyone asking me this?
They want me to be suicidal?
Or is it just the consequence of your utter absurdity?
Excuse me.
What scent are you wearing?
- What are you talking about?
- The perfume you're wearing.
I'm not wearing any perfume!
You see, that could be the problem.
- I've become friends with a group.
- Really?
- Although they're perfume-obsessed.
- Oh, them?
Those girls?
The ones who volunteer at the center?
- Yeah.
- But they're terrible.
The blond one?
She's notorious.
- What do you mean?
- Such a bitch.
Terrible, isn't she?
- Would balsamic be okay?
- What?
Balsamic vinegar.
For the dressing.
Yeah, sure.
- What's that?
- What?
- Those.
- Artichokes?
Is that what they look like?
Come on, Lily.
You've seen an artichoke before.
- You haven't?
- They look so weird.
I'm not convinced that having a suicide-prevention center... prevents any suicides.
Well, the coffee's good.
If someone were determined to destroy themselves...
- ...
I don't think they'd stop for coffee.
- It depends on what it tastes like.
- Where are we going?
- I thought I'd take Priss over to DU.
Why?
It might be helpful for her to meet some of the guys.
How would that be helpful?
They're morons.
- Oh, come on, Lily.
- No, they're morons.
No.
Not medically.
I like them.
They're in that sympathetic range of being not good-looking... and yet not smart.
There's something likable about that.
Spending time with them, you get the sense that you're making a difference.
For somebody suicidal, like Priss, that could be a real boost.
- I'm not suicidal.
- Oh, that's good.
It's better not to have an identity as a suicidal person, don't you think?
- Well, bye.
- Well...
- Where are you going?
- Over to Xavier's.
- Is that a good idea?
- Why wouldn't it be?
- Is his girlfriend gonna be there?
- Of course.
- Gosh, you're nosy.
- No, no, it's just a general foreboding.
"Foreboding"?
You know, you're absolutely right.
I was being nosy.
Terribly so.
- I've gotta watch that.
- Yes, we must improve ourselves.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
Lily.
- You were coming over?
- Hey.
Yeah.
Is Alice home?
Alice is working.
- Oh, she is?
- But it's not a problem.
It's good you came.
Let's go to the Oak Bar.
I'll buy you a beer.
- I thought Alice would be back.
- I'll call her.
She'll join us there.
Come on.
Okay.
She's actually quite a good person.
Her entire identity revolves around helping people.
You really think that's true?
What's she have against The Complainer?
That's bizarre.
Well, she thinks the editor, Rick DeWolfe, is completely egotistical.
And your friend isn't?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi, Lily.
- Hi.
- Great.
You got the message.
- Yeah.
- Who's egotistical?
- Lily's roommate.
She sounds unbearable.
She's on a rampage against The Complainer.
Really?
Why?
She thinks the editor, Rick DeWolfe, is conceited.
- And, in fact, quite mean.
- Mean?
Yes.
He wants to close the Seven Oaks Roman Letter Clubs.
That's good, isn't it?
Everyone was against them.
- No.
- Come on.
There's no justification for those places.
They're exclusive and elitist.
The point that Violet makes is that they can't be elitist.
- They're morons.
- Yeah, elitist morons.
You'll grant they're morons.
That's a handicap.
Such people should be helped, not hounded and persecuted.
- Persecuted?
- Yes, losing the roof over your head?
That's the worst thing that can happen.
Violet thinks there could be some risk of suicide.
Because some boy might kill himself, Seven Oaks can't do what's right?
It's a factor to be considered.
- Yeah.
- No, it isn't.
You can't set policy that way.
- Excuse me, we didn't order these.
- Compliments of the guy at the bar.
That's a playboy or operator move.
Operators like that are to be avoided.
Why?
It seems generous, sending drinks to people you don't know.
- Drinks are expensive.
- Drinks to two gorgeous girls.
His intention was to seduce and he assumed he could.
- Both?
- That seems a bit harsh.
You don't know what he was thinking.
Was he alone?
Yes.
You see?
He was alone and probably lonely.
He could see that Alice and Lily were students.
Students are known for their intelligent conversation.
They can always talk about their courses.
That was probably what attracted him.
Nonsense.
Perhaps his view was even loftier.
To court Lily with a view to matrimony.
We're in the north, but a southern gentleman... can wander into these parts.
Rubbish.
Seeing Lily across a crowded bar filled with the usual undergraduate slobs.
Why wouldn't a thoughtful young man seek her out?
She's lovely.
Isn't it incumbent on men and women to find ways to meet each other?
Buying drinks for a person you don't know seems to be a generous one.
Yes.
Most guys won't even pay for the women they do know.
What you've described is a playboy or operator move.
I'll grant you that it's a tactic or perhaps even a ruse... but without some of that, would our species even survive?
The Lord said, "Be fruitful and multiply."
Oh, my gosh.
No, this is how the world works, seeing someone across a room.
This could be the romantic story you tell your grandchildren.
And if you do marry and have children... then he'll really learn how to squander cash.
Isn't it good to know that he's basically generous from the start?
Where's Priss?
Your eyes are so striking.
So blue.
- Really?
They're blue?
- Yes.
The most piercing blue.
You must know your eyes are blue.
- No.
- What do you mean?
What?
You must know what color your eyes are.
Your eyes are very blue.
You know that.
I'm not gonna go around checking what color my eyes are.
When you look in the mirror, you see that your eyes are blue.
- Oh, come on.
- What?
I don't think my eyes have a color.
If my eyes are so blue looking out, wouldn't everything be kind of blue?
Like, have a bluish tinge to it?
Doesn't.
Just looks normal.
That's...?
That's blue?
- That color?
- Yes, of course.
Then what color is that?
Green.
You're saying that chair's green but Frank's eyes are blue?
Yes.
Then what color are the walls?
Also green.
You didn't know that?
No.
How's that possible?
You think knowing the colors is so important?
You're in college and you don't know the colors?
Doesn't that embarrass you?
Well, no.
Why should it?
That's why the 'rents are paying big bucks to send me here.
You know, to learn stuff.
Well, gotta go hit the books.
I don't think anyone should feel embarrassed about not knowing stuff.
What's embarrassing is pretending to know.
Or putting people down because you think they don't know as much.
Look, I'm happy to admit I'm completely ignorant.
That's why I'm here and plan to really hit the books.
So the next time you see me, I will know more than I do now.
I'll be older but also wiser.
Or at least know more stuff.
For me, that's education.
Cheers.
Thor's great.
He's very clear about his objectives.
He really wants to learn things.
Frank?
What a jerk.
- He's a monster.
- Oh, my gosh, Violet.
You did everything for them.
They're nothing without you.
- What a rat.
- He's a moron.
- Don't waste a tear on that creep.
- Don't waste a single breath.
- Jerk.
- Stop.
- Please.
- What?
I love Frank.
I love him.
Come on, Violet, Frank's a moron.
You are well rid of him.
- Don't say that.
- Frank's not a moron?
You know, Lily, you're a bit harsh.
This obsession with intelligence.
Do you think it has some magical quality transforming everything?
The intelligence line is not an immutable barrier.
Love can cross it.
You can love someone whose mental capacity is not large.
I know.
I have.
- Well, there's a mutable barrier, then.
- Frank's stupid, we knew.
That he's a rat playboy operator, I hadn't realized.
I don't want to turn bitter.
- I worry for Frank.
I care about him.
- Well, I'd stop.
No.
I love Frank.
I always will.
If that's the case, why not fight for him?
- Against Priss?
I'd never win.
- Sure you would.
Priss is a rat.
A bitch.
A rat bitch.
Don't blame Priss.
She was crushed when her blue-eyed Josh left her.
I should've known.
Of course she'd fall for Frank.
Josh and Frank are both blue-eyed heartbreakers.
Poor Violet.
She's the roommate who's so self-confident?
Yeah.
But now she's a wreck.
But there's no logic to the algebra of love.
"The algebra of love."
That sounds like the title to some lame book.
It's a title, but the book's not lame at all.
Love's algebra?
I thought it was more geometry.
Okay, the title's not good, but the book is.
What's it say?
Well, that while we're all perverse in our romantic preferences... there's actually this logic or algebra to our perversity... and it has something to do with how the species has evolved.
- The survival of the species?
- Yes.
And whether it will continue to do so.
No booze?
Just to find the nearest package store, you had to drive 40 miles.
- These aren't so strong.
- No, they're really strong.
I think I'd like another.
- That wouldn't be a good idea.
- Why not?
- Well...
- Are you trying to stifle me?
- Lily?
- Oh, hi.
Listen, we're gonna get something to eat.
Why don't you come with us?
- I'm with Charlie.
- I can see that.
- But you really should come.
- Why?
I just think it would be a good idea.
- But why?
- You really must come.
I insist.
Lily?
Lily, are you angry?
Lily, this is it.
We're here.
What's the matter?
That was so rude.
He's a nice guy and you embarrassed him.
He's not nice.
He was trying to get you drunk.
- No, he wasn't.
- Plying you with martinis?
- I was plying myself with martinis.
- Come on, the guy's a total sleaze.
- A creep.
- You don't know anything about him.
The way he sent drinks over to our table?
Alice.
Alice, what's wrong?
I had no idea that Xavier could be so mean.
Sounds as if he was just trying to protect you.
This Charlie Walker sounds like an operator or playboy type.
No, he's not like that.
He's actually a really nice guy.
I thought he was a slick businessman.
No.
He dresses well, but he works in strategic development.
- What?
- Strategic development.
He works at SDA.
Strategic Development Associates.
- He's an associate there.
- What he is, is a strategic operator.
Violet, are you okay?
Hey, miss, rain's coming!
Better get back!
- Polly, have you seen Violet?
- No.
Is something wrong?
We're not sure.
Violet!
- Violet!
- Violet!
Oh, my gosh, what happened?
I don't understand.
What were you doing?
How long were you gone for?
I'm sorry, I don't know.
I lost track of time.
But you feel better now?
Well, cleaner.
She'll say anything to get in the show.
- She'll want doughnuts.
- You don't have to be suicidal...
- ...to get doughnuts, just depressed.
- Clinically depressed.
From a clinic.
- Would you say you're depressed?
- I don't like the term.
- I prefer to say I'm in a tailspin.
- Oh, my God.
A tailspin?
She can't even say she's depressed.
She's gotta say something special.
Priss was honest.
She was depressed and she had a right to be in the show.
Now every silly tailspinner's trying to get in.
- The show is for everyone.
- No, it isn't, Freak.
To be in the center's programs, you have to be clinically depressed.
That means that you've been to a clinic... and they've said that you're depressed.
Have you been to a clinic?
Have you been to a clinic?
Then you're not clinically depressed.
Violet.
Violet.
What is it?
Where are you going?
All I wanted was to make Frank happy.
I had all these plans.
Things we could've done together.
I never even got to tell him.
Hey!
Where all your boyfriends at?
Come on!
They don't wear bikinis.
They're ladies, they wear thongs.
I can't imagine where she could've gone.
Wherever she went, she should be back by now.
How did she seem when you last saw her?
Really sad about Frank.
- Still?
- Yeah.
How can someone so smart continue mooning over a dope like that?
People aren't exactly as you assume.
The Violet you know... bears little resemblance to the girl I met in seventh grade.
- You met Violet in seventh grade?
- Well, her name wasn't Violet then.
What's your name?
You can tell us your name.
We won't bite.
What's your name?
Tell us.
Are you retarded?
Tell us your name.
Emily Tweeter.
- Tweeter?
Like a bird?
- That's ridiculous.
Tweeter?
Like a bird?
- Not an easy name to have at that age.
- Not at any age.
What was she like?
Timid.
Bookish.
Classic scholarship student.
Her parents were writers.
They didn't have a dime.
Finances were the least of her worries.
- What do you mean?
- Well, she was crazy.
I got stuck rooming with her on a trip when no one else would.
- It was awful.
- Did she smell bad?
No.
Obsessive cleanliness was part of her insanity.
- You were nice to her.
- No.
The idea of being nice to weird kids hadn't arrived.
- Why was she so unpopular?
- Well, she was very strange.
Constantly setting herself odd, repetitive tasks.
Tasks?
For example, on that trip she had with her a little square suitcase.
The idea came into her head she had to move it... in a precise pattern over and over again... and if she didn't execute this movement flawlessly 10 times... she'd start over.
Another was to slide her hand across her forehead... trying not to touch her hair or eyebrows on either side... also repeating it 10 times.
Any niggling thought she'd touched the hair, she'd start over.
- My God, that is insane.
- Why would she do that?
She had the conviction that if she didn't complete these tasks... her parents would die.
- Was she Catholic?
- No.
But what made the whole thing really sad... was that her parents did die.
Oh, my God.
Violet!
Violet?
Violet!
Violet, where are you?
Something's wrong, isn't it, dear?
You mind my asking?
Well, I do mind a little.
- Excuse me, Your Highness.
- I'm sorry.
- It's just kind of awkward to talk about.
- No matter.
I hope you haven't come to get run over on the highway.
- What do you mean?
- Suicides.
They come down from the university.
Jump out in the road.
Get hit by the blind curve.
Hope you're not one of them.
Do I look like one of them?
I don't know.
Maybe.
Messy people, suicides.
Think only of themselves and their own deaths.
Not what comes after.
They leave quite a mess.
They don't stick around to clean it up.
So you're not one of those depressed students from the university?
I don't like the word "depressed." I prefer to say that I'm in a tailspin.
A tailspin?
- Does this tailspin involve a man?
- Yes, it does.
But I'm not as crazy as I was up till yesterday.
Apparently that's due to the salutary effect of scent on the human psyche.
Its importance is, I believe, almost incalculable.
At the motel, I happened to use this soap.
It was provided to me as a courtesy as one of the guests.
That an economical motel... would provide such good soap is quite unusual.
- The scent is very precise.
- Really?
Tell me if it provokes any particular reaction in your psyche.
A state of mind.
I always knew she was unstable.
They're gonna have her photo at the registrar's.
Violet!
Violet!
You're back!
You're okay!
Not really.
Oh, my gosh, Violet, we were so worried.
Why didn't you tell us or leave a note?
I did leave a note.
Would that be a suicide note?
- I wouldn't leave without a note.
- Where did you go?
I took the train to Villafranca and checked into a motel there.
- The Motel 6?
- No, the Motel 4.
- It's even less expensive.
- The Motel 4 in Villafranca?
- My God, you really were suicidal.
- Why'd you go?
I had to do something.
And you really thought you were gonna find the answer in Villafranca?
I'm not sure what I expected, but I might have found it.
What?
Soap?
This scent and this soap... is what gives me hope.
Hello?
Is anyone here?
Hello?
Lily?
- Hello?
- Oh, my gosh.
I couldn't understand where everyone was.
Sorry, I just went out to get some things.
- Where's Alice?
- Gone.
What do you mean?
Left.
We broke up.
- But when you called, you said...
- I know, I'm sorry.
I thought it better to tell you in person.
Alice couldn't control her jealousy.
It completely overwhelmed her.
Really?
What was she jealous of?
Come on.
No, what?
You.
After a while, I just couldn't handle it.
Things became impossible.
She was jealous of me?
Of course.
Would it be okay if we watch a film?
Yes.
What would you like to see?
I thought maybe Truffaut's Baisers volés.
Stolen Kisses.
Do you know it?
No, is it new?
It's a classic of French New Wave cinema.
I think you'll like it.
- But it's in color?
- Yeah.
- You don't know Truffaut?
- No.
Do you know Godard, Á bout de souffle?
- Why was Alice so jealous?
- What do you think?
She was jealous because Lily's lovely.
I don't know.
They had a lot of problems.
Of course.
You wouldn't break up a happy couple.
- What's that?
- A note Frank left.
- Really?
Recently?
- No, when we were together.
Now that most correspondence is electronic... it's rare to be left anything written by hand.
Frank can write by hand?
- What is it?
- It's not very important.
It's just all I have.
- What's it say?
- "Out for brewskis.
Back in a giff."
What's a "giff"?
One of those little motor scooters, isn't it?
I'm sure he meant to write "jiff" with a J. "Back in a jiff."
But he wrote "giff."
- Could Frank be dyslexic?
- No.
Dyslexics are intelligent.
- What's that?
- Frank's bean ball.
- He gave you his bean ball?
- Not exactly.
This is an extra.
He thought he'd leave it here just in case he lost his other one.
Gosh, Violet, you've really gotta stop thinking about Frank.
Why?
I don't wanna stop thinking about him.
Recently I had a thought that cheered me up a lot.
Life is like a long, flowing river... and as a long, flowing river, some debris you never expect to see again... is almost certain to reappear floating to the surface.
Frank and I may very well be together again one day.
Maybe it'll take years, but somewhere down the line... he's very likely to pop up again, and I'll be there to catch him.
I don't think we've spoken about this.
What?
Have you been to the south of France?
To the walled city of Carcassonne?
- I've never been anywhere.
- But you've seen pictures of it.
No, I don't think so.
Oh, it's fascinating.
- I'd like to visit.
- You never studied the Cathars?
They were a religious movement... very idealistic... located mostly in the southwest of France... that the Catholic Church repressed.
Oh, my God.
The Catholic Church is, like, always bad.
Ideas can't be killed as easily as people.
Especially such enlightened ones as the Cathars held.
In recent years, more and more people have returned to their beliefs.
So you're a Cathar?
Yes.
I aspire to be.
I'm trying to follow the path the Cathars marked out.
That's so impressive.
I can tell you we didn't have any Cathars back home.
I think you'd be surprised.
In the Cathar view... the highest form of lovemaking avoids procreation entirely.
Sure.
Condoms, right?
Well, according to Cathar ideas... sex with condoms is just a parody of the procreative act.
What do you mean?
The standard, cliché form of sexual intercourse... is for the man to approach a woman from the front.
Cathar lovemaking, I think you'll find very fulfilling.
I'll be very careful, we'll go slowly.
It'll be a new experience... but one which I think you'll find brings an inexpressible closeness.
Might your drinks-buying friend be around?
It would be great to get complimentary cocktails.
- Charlie?
No.
- Do you still see him at all?
- He calls from time to time.
- He does?
- Why don't you introduce us?
- Why should I introduce you?
Because you know him, and we don't.
So?
"So?"
"So" is probably the unkindest word in the English language.
I can't bear it.
I think it should be outlawed. "So."
You're crazy.
Come on, Lily, you have Xavier.
- You can't keep two guys for yourself.
- Guys do that all the time.
We're not guys, fortunately.
It's unconscionable for you not to bring him and introduce us.
Charlie is a friend.
He's a nice guy.
What do you mean?
I hate to think what'd happen if you got your claws into him.
That's outrageous.
We're perfectly nice.
We've met lots of pathetic guys and nothing bad's happened.
- Charlie's not pathetic.
- Well, all the better, then.
The Roman Holidays will be coming soon.
- What's that?
- A festival Roman Letter Clubs put on.
A kind of moron jamboree.
The Roman elements are the worship of Bacchus, Beerus and Blotto.
- It could've all been so uplifting.
- Charlie.
Hey, Charlie.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
- Have you the day off?
- Yeah.
This is my friend Charlie, whom I think I've mentioned.
And, Charlie, these are my roommates.
This is...
This is Rose.
And this is Heather.
And Violet.
Charlie works for Strategic Development Associates.
He's an associate there.
You work in strategic development?
- You've heard of it?
- Of course, yes.
My cousin Jay in Philadelphia works in strategic development.
Something business-related?
Mostly business, but any kind of organization.
- Only businesses pay the big bucks.
- Nonprofits and government pay well.
That's how they keep from having profits... by paying lots of money to companies like yours.
Excuse me, but aren't you in Professor Ryan's course at the Ed School?
No.
You're not in Professor Ryan's Flit Lit course?
No.
- Flit Lit?
- The dandy tradition in literature.
- I'm sure I've seen you there.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm not in any courses at the Ed School.
Good to meet you.
- It was great to see you.
- Bye.
God, Violet, what was that about?
That guy is definitely in Professor Ryan's class.
Not possible.
He has a fulltime job for Strategic Development Associates.
He never got his coffee.
- Why lie about something like that?
- He's lying.
I find that very attractive.
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna stop cutting Professor Ryan's class.
It can be argued that Firbank was too little disciplined... too unserious in his unseriousness... to create works of enduring value.
But as a liberating influence on later writers such as Waugh... his importance should not be discounted.
It's not Firbank's work itself but the idea of his work... that so helped later writers... as Thomas Love Peacock did in the previous century.
I'm not gonna come anymore.
- What a waste of time.
- Charlie.
Charlie.
- Charlie?
- Charlie, you are taking the course.
Charlie?
Who's Charlie?
- Fred, what's going on?
- Fred?
Fred.
Sounds like you got some explaining to do.
- Well, you were lying.
- I wasn't lying, I was making it up.
Why were you making it up?
If you were an eighth-year Ed School student, would you advertise that?
Eighth year.
Impressive.
But your whole life was a lie.
Dressing up in suits.
Buying people drinks.
The suits were real.
The drinks, real.
Not just drinks for people.
They were for cute girls.
There's a perfectly rational, easily explainable agenda.
So it was a playboy or operator move.
- Of course.
Transparently so.
- I admire that.
Drinks are expensive.
But strategic development, that was made up too?
- You said your cousin Jay was in it.
- What cousin Jay?
- In Philadelphia.
- I don't have a cousin in Philadelphia.
You said your cousin Jay was working in strategic development.
I was just saying that to be friendly.
To make a kind of link.
- So your name's Fred something?
- Yes.
Fred something.
- Packenstacker?
- Oh, my God.
How crazy.
He's completely insane.
I almost dated him.
- You can say that about a lot of guys.
- I don't think he's crazy.
Making up an entirely fictitious identity, that's not crazy?
- It's insane.
It's psycho.
- Violet's identity is made up.
- I don't think she's crazy.
- No, I am.
No, this is different.
It's crazy and pathetic.
All that about strategic development he just made up.
Don't tell me that's not weird.
I've heard of strategic development.
I think it's something pretty important.
Violet, you're not gonna start going out with him.
You're not, are you?
Well, we had planned to go to the library.
- Not to the stacks, I hope.
- Yes.
Oh, my gosh, do you realize how dangerous that is?
- Dangerous?
- Yes, the stacks.
They're dark and deserted.
Anything could happen.
It's true.
With the study habits at Seven Oaks... your body won't be found until spring.
Promise you won't go with him to the stacks.
Please.
Okay.
I'll suggest the Randall Room.
- Don't suggest.
Insist.
- And please not at night.
Okay.
What are you reading?
Have you chosen a topic for your final paper?
The decline of decadence.
You think that decadence has declined?
Definitely.
Bigtime.
Major, major decline.
How?
How or in what ways?
Either.
Well, take the flit movement in literature, or homosexuality.
It's gone completely downhill, right down the tubes.
What do you mean?
Before, homosexuality was something refined, hidden... aspiring to the highest levels of creativity and often achieving it.
Now it seems to be musclebound morons running around in T-shirts.
It's pretty disillusioning.
Are you gay?
Not especially, but in another era, it might have had some appeal.
- Now I just don't see the point.
- You might be romanticizing the past.
We'll never know.
The past is gone, so we might as well romanticize it.
You could be right.
I wanted to ask, how's Lily?
Lily.
She's okay.
Here, check it out.
A.L.A. Nope.
Hello.
Good afternoon.
Check it out.
The A.L.A. Heard of it?
We have a meeting on Tuesday.
- You should come by.
- What is the A.L.A.?
Just join us.
Come Tuesday.
I think you'll really like it.
So...
A fellow was passing these out, and invited us to a meeting on Tuesday.
The A.L.A.?
Oh, my God.
I thought it was something related.
No?
The A.L.A. has got nothing to do with us.
Can't you see that?
The way we express love has meaning.
It's in the context of something beautiful.
We're following our creator's teaching.
Aspiring to an ideal.
A beautiful one that brings an inexpressible closeness.
Not just to each other, but...
For the A.L.A., and those like them... the love act is just hedonistic pleasure-seeking... of a perverted nature.
I can't believe you'd think we had anything in common with them.
We don't.
Nothing, not an iota.
My God, can't you see that?
Lily.
Lily, come back.
Please.
Don't be that way.
- Oh, my gosh, Lily.
Are you okay?
- It's all right.
You don't wanna talk about it?
I don't understand.
- You don't understand what?
- What is non-procreative lovemaking?
- It could be a lot of things.
- Yeah, but in this case?
- We don't have to talk about this.
- I don't mind.
Could somebody explain what this is about?
Well, if...
Cathars don't believe in procreative sex.
They don't have intercourse the usual way.
The usual way?
- You don't have to talk about this.
- No, it's okay.
It's the normal way, from the front where you can have procreation... not from the other side, where you can't.
The other side?
That's their religion?
No, but it's the direction their beliefs head in.
When they express love, that's what they do.
How horrible.
You poor girl.
What?
That's terrible... what he obliged Lily to do.
Violet.
Can we talk?
You must be pretty mad at me.
No.
You're not?
Not really.
But it was so terrible how everything happened.
Your walking in on us.
Maybe it's easier that way.
That bitch!
I can't believe it.
What a bitch.
- Priss?
- Of course Priss.
"I'm so stressed.
Sad.
Depressed.
I'm so tired.
I'm fatigued."
She was so depressed... she had to get everything her own way.
"I'm so stressed.
Frantic."
Man.
What a bitch.
Priss dumped you?
No.
It was mutual.
Oh, listen, I have a question.
You remember that bean ball that I left in your room?
Yeah.
Do you still have it?
Yeah.
Do you think I could get it back?
I lost the other one, and with everything that's happened...
I'd really like to have it.
Nothing like some bean ball after a breakup.
Yeah.
God, you're smart.
You always get it.
Whatever I say... you understand.
Man.
Hey, Heather.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey.
Violet.
Violet, what's wrong?
I'm sorry.
Lily's lovely.
Now she's free.
Go.
I understand.
Latin!
Et cetera!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
This is what comes from not teaching Latin in the schools.
Yeah, it's moronic and boorish, but it's also kind of fun, don't you think?
No.
What's that stench?
I suppose this is what happens when decadence rots society from within.
And from without.
Such a society is, I fear... destined to fail and be overrun.
Maybe that's good.
Finally.
It's about time those cesspools were drained.
What color would you say that chair is?
That's a chair?
I have no idea.
- Guys have preferences.
- You're going to accept that?
- You're not going to do anything?
- There's nothing to be done.
- Fred must know his own mind.
- Oh, really?
- I seriously doubt that.
- Come on.
Lily's got that slender, delicately swelling beauty...
- ...that no man can resist.
- Okay, you're probably right.
Poor Lily.
Just think of all Xavier put her through.
He just used her body.
And not even the right side.
Have you noticed that good people tend to have large posteriors?
Not everyone, by any means.
I know it's not logical.
But it does seem to be true.
The genetic link between morality and large posteriors?
Yes, I think that's well known.
You and Violet have that build.
It's nice.
You're still very attractive, but also sensible and moralistic.
I don't.
I have narrow hips, but also no very strong principles.
Yes?
Oh, hi.
- Hi, Frank.
- Hey, Heather.
So I guess you guys all heard.
University's closing all the Roman Letter Houses.
Sorry.
This year's Roman Holidays did seem like the end of civilization... but when civilization ends people are going to need a place to stay.
Man.
It's bad.
It's that bastard from The Complainer.
Someone from the administration's been reading it.
Hard to believe.
Bastard.
Listen... we were wondering... if you thought it would be okay if we stayed at the suicide center.
Okay, sure.
That sounds like a good stopgap measure.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So there's one more thing.
Remember that bean ball we talked about?
Yes.
You think I could pick that up?
Just after everything that's happened, it...
I could really use it right now.
Yes.
- What's that?
- What?
The note.
One gets so few things written by hand anymore, I guess I kept it.
"Out for brewskis, back in a giff."
What's a giff?
It's the scooter.
Like a Vespa, right?
- That's what I thought.
- I was thinking about getting one.
You must've meant "jiff." "Back in a jiff."
And then misspelled it, or spelled it in a nonstandard way.
Yeah.
Not a good speller.
Thanks.
You're great.
Priss was such a bitch.
Damn.
Hey, Heather.
Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Heather is really cute.
She going out with anyone?
There might be something between her and Thor.
Thor?
Damn.
Heather and Thor?
Damn.
I'm worried about Thor.
It's hard for us to imagine... how upsetting it is not knowing the colors.
It's impossible for me to imagine.
When Thor sees a rainbow, it's so much gibberish to him.
There was one this afternoon.
Oh, my gosh, he took it hard.
Recently, there was a parade in the city... where the marchers carried rainbow-colored flags and banners.
Thor was so upset.
He had no idea what it meant.
What kind of retard is he?
See, that's the conclusion people jump to.
- Well, it is somewhat understandable.
- Not if you knew the full story.
What's the full story?
You know how parents love bragging... about how precocious their children are?
Thor's parents had become precocity addicts... constantly needing an ever-greater precocity fix.
He should've entered kindergarten.
They pushed him into first grade.
"Thor skipped a grade," they could tell.
What Thor's parents failed to consider is the work done in nursery school.
Key being the study of colors.
I suppose they just assumed... that colors are knowledge people pick up.
Like, for example, not stepping on sidewalk cracks.
What's that?
I think Rose is sleeping.
Am I boring?
No, not at all.
When you have problems, it's great to hear someone else's idiotic ones.
Please go on.
- What?
- What you said about... depressed people being mean, you weren't joking.
I'm sorry, you're right.
Please go on.
No.
I'm sorry.
You know how I am.
Please continue.
Thor decided he absolutely had to learn all the colors.
Both primary and mixed.
He's been hitting the books hard, and thought he'd mastered them.
Then, in town, he said, "That traffic light's blue."
I had to say, "No, it's green."
He was really upset.
Oh, hi, Lily.
Hi.
We were worried about you.
I can't bear this tension with Lily.
It's terrible to have the group divided this way.
Better not next to Robertson.
What?
Didn't you hear?
Ed students have been going up to the roof... and throwing themselves off.
- But it's only two stories.
- Yes, I know.
It's terrible.
Not high enough to kill, but high enough to maim.
And particularly dangerous for anyone below.
I've got to forget about Fred.
But you really liked him.
This whole thing of a person meeting someone else first, it's so arbitrary.
- It's terrible and cruel.
- I have to say, I was wrong about Fred.
I thought he was a playboy or operator type.
In fact, he's just another guy rendered helpless...
- ...by the attentions of a pretty girl.
- Cary!
No, don't!
I love you!
- Why did you do that?
- Oh, my God!
Cary, I love you!
Isn't the Ed School essentially a teacher's college?
Yeah.
If they can't even destroy themselves... how are they going to teach America's youth?
- What do you think you're doing?
- Sorry.
Did I disturb you?
Why are you wearing tap shoes?
You out of your mind?
- I think that's pretty clear.
- I'm so sick of that.
Oh, really?
I think it's cute.
Since you won't be treating us to one of your incompetent tap routines...
- ...why don't you take those things off?
- No.
We'll do the routine.
Rose.
- Madge wants to see the routine.
- I don't want to see your routine.
- I asked you to take those off.
- We need a break.
Just briefly, please.
It's helpful to have an audience.
Rose, the music.
I'm gonna report you.
Suzanne.
For me, it'd be Madame Curie, Simone de Beauvoir...
- ...and Margaret Sanger.
- Good.
Violet.
I would say...
Richard Strauss, Roderick Charleston... and Chubbard Checker.
- Richard Strauss?
The composer?
- Yes, that was one of his posts.
I'm not familiar with the others.
Could you tell us who they are?
Yes.
Each one of these men started an international dance craze.
Richard Strauss, the waltz.
Roderick Charleston, the Charleston.
Chubbard Checker, known as Chubby... the dance we know as the twist.
Why do you consider a dance craze important?
Dance crazes enhance and elevate the human experience... bringing together millions of people... in a joyous celebration of our God-given faculties... and passing these modes of physical expression... down through the generations.
Though not so much anymore.
I thought...
Well, I assumed that the Charleston... was named after the city of Charleston.
No.
Though that misconception is quite widely held.
It was Roderick Charleston.
Usually, behind some great creative phenomenon... there's a person, not a town.
This is so exciting.
It's really great, isn't it?
- Hey, could you guys help?
- Sure.
What's up?
We need help packing soap... which we'll distribute to Doar Dorm residents.
Cool.
What would you say are effective means to fight depression?
Maybe some of your DU brothers have an idea?
- Beer?
- No.
Beer's a downer.
Cocktails.
Hard liquor and spirits is what really gives you a lift.
It's interesting what you say.
My cousin Jay is a medical officer in Philadelphia.
He says that alcoholism... by which I mean chronic, excessive consumption of alcohol... is the primary self-administered treatment for depression.
- Cool.
- No.
It leaves you much worse off than before.
Oh, no, not me.
I just boot and then I feel fine.
- By "boot" do you mean vomit?
- Yes.
No.
None of the effective anti-suicide treatments involve vomiting.
- Hygiene?
- Exactly.
It's very important.
That's why we have such hope in the wonder bar.
Do you know its scent?
Transformative, we think.
This is so exciting.
When should we go over there?
- I don't think there's any rush.
- I'd like to go soon.
Doar Dorm has the highest fatality rate, as well as the worst hygiene.
Highest suicide rate.
Fatality rate.
It's uncertain what percentage were intentional... and how many were just due to unawareness of gravity's laws.
I can just see those guys getting the gold packages, opening them... and finding the good-smelling soap inside.
The cute packaging should prove irresistible.
And once clean, they'll start to see the world with new eyes.
The change could be dramatic.
Doar Dorm could soon become Dior Dorm.
I doubt that, to be perfectly, absolutely honest.
I love the idea.
Dior Dorm.
I adore optimism, even when it's completely absurd.
- Perhaps especially then.
- Great.
Ready?
Let's go.
Let's hurry.
Let's not get our hopes up too high, Heather.
No, you said yourself, the wonder bar is transformative.
- Hey, Violet.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Where you going?
- Doar Dorm.
- Fred, hi.
- Hey.
Good one.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
I guess it wasn't realistic to expect Doar Dorm... to turn into Dior Dorm overnight.
They wouldn't even open them.
They said without the soap, the discs wouldn't fly properly.
Are you coming Friday?
Violet's launching her dance craze.
Oh, really?
That's great.
- What's the dance?
- The Sambola.
The devil's dance.
- Oh, cool.
We'll go, right?
- Yes, I'd like to.
But I have several papers to finish.
But I'd like to.
Great.
Thanks, Gus.
I don't see how we're going to start a dance craze if no guys show up.
Most guys aren't very good with the dance-craze thing.
Very good news.
I was just in my procrastination seminar... and the two guys from Doar Dorm had showered.
It was clear they'd used soap.
Oh, my gosh, what a difference.
Seems they'd been throwing packages so energetically, a soap bar fell out.
The unfamiliar ivory-like object intrigued them... and one thing led to another, and, well...
It was just as you said.
Isn't that great?
- Oh, look, here's Jimbo.
- Jimbo doesn't count.
Where is everybody?
Aren't we gonna be late for Violet's dance craze?
You wanna go to that?
Yeah.
- You're kidding.
- No, I love dance crazes.
Gosh, you're strange.
But aren't we already late?
No, it's later on.
Like 10, I think.
I have to confess, I've started losing patience with Violet.
Depression calls for serious treatment.
Medication.
Psychopharmaceuticals.
Talk therapy.
Are those approaches effective?
Despite the medication and therapy...
Ed School students are still throwing themselves off Robertson Hall.
Violet's ideas might seem a little offbeat...
A little?
Oh, my God.
I don't know how much you know about Violet... but there's some pretty weird stuff.
You know, Violet.
Violet Wister.
It's not even her real name.
- It isn't?
- No, it's Emily Tweeter.
When she was 11, she went completely crazy... and has had several relapses since.
So it's a little worrisome to have her counsel nearly suicidal individuals.
I can't believe it.
- What?
- Emily Tweeter.
In first grade, I had an enormous crush on a girl with that name.
- And you remember that?
- Yeah.
Pretty huge Dr. Zhivago stuff.
Any idea or even mention of her filled me with emotion.
I had a strange perspective on the world.
I don't think my brain was functioning properly.
Everything was a bit of a dream.
You think this was Violet?
You have any idea if Violet attended willamette Montessori?
In Portland?
- We didn't order these.
- Compliments of the guy at the bar.
It was so brutal how it ended between us.
I know I was too angry and a bit crazy... but I thought that what we had was stronger than that.
That you would not just walk away after one disagreement.
It wasn't just that.
You mean my Cathar beliefs.
Well...
I am no longer a Cathar.
How is that possible?
It's been very difficult.
You've dropped your adherence to the Cathar faith?
- Yes, I have.
- Good.
Normally I'd be reluctant to comment on anyone's religion, but...
What?
I'm sorry.
I guess...
I guess I'm a bit of a bigot.
I just...
I could never take seriously any religion that worships on Tuesdays.
Major religions require worship on the weekend.
Friday, Saturday or Sunday.
I find it just really laudatory... that people sacrifice their weekend time to worship God.
Having the Sabbath on Tuesday always seemed very bizarre to me.
It's not right.
You know what?
We'd better get to the Lone Star.
Why are you so concerned about that?
Well, it's not as if international dance crazes start every day.
We'd better hurry.
What's wrong?
Another fiasco.
Sometimes our struggle reminds me of the myth of Sisyphus.
- Who?
- The myth about the guy... who pushes an enormous rock only to have it keep rolling back.
Oh, yeah.
What a knucklehead.
The important thing to remember is that he was mythical.
He never really existed.
Violet?
Did you spend any part of your education... at Willamette Montessori?
In Oregon?
Why?
Sound like "tweaker."
Would you say today is very gray?
I'd say so.
Maybe blue-gray.
Yeah, no, that rings a bell now.
Bye.
I'm sorry.
Her name wasn't Emily Tweeter, but Lucy Wurlitzer.
They're not similar.
I'm beginning to realize that the human memory... is not the foolproof instrument we sometimes imagine.
What's worse, everyone knew about my obsession, including my parents... those from whom I most wanted it kept.
So from your earliest years, you were already a playboy or operator type?
Yes.
I suppose that's why secrecy seemed so desirable.
Violet, can we talk?
- What's the plural of doofus?
- Doufi.
Not doofuses?
You can say either.
"Doufi" respects the Latin root and is preferred.
"Doofuses" is also correct, although a bit inelegant.
- You've thought a lot about this.
- Yes, I've had to.
Why?
What is it?
I like Fred, he's a nice guy.
And I can see why you like him.
When I first met you and Rose, I thought you were the cool crowd.
And in many ways you are.
I find your perfume and fashion sense excellent.
Thank you.
But there's a reason, I think... why you are so strongly attracted to... doufi.
And it's not an accident how different groups divide up.
Isn't that a rainbow?
- That's a rainbow!
- Thor.
No, Thor!
Thor, no!
Stop!
Please, stop!
He's headed for Robertson Hall!
Red.
Orange.
Yellow.
Green.
Blue.
Indigo.
Hallelujah!
Lord God, thank you.
Education.
Education.
We can learn the subjects we set out to master... no matter how hard or impossible they may seem.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I wasn't sure I was gonna make it.
Magenta.
Pink.
Mauve.
I miss my nice American friend.
No, you're mistaken.
- You go to London for four weeks?
- Six.
It's dangerous, parents letting children travel.
They send them off and they don't know what they'll be getting back.
I don't know what you're referring to.
You're not from London.
I'm from London.
I was there, now I'm here.
I'm from London.
I just miss my nice American friend.
Nice?
Nice?
Fine.
I'm fine.
Those are not adjectives I like to use.
God gave us abilities.
He requires that we use them.
Good, better, best, excelsior, higher.
Only excellence can glorify the Lord.
Vulgarity is, in essence, blasphemous.
I'm sorry for what I was saying before.
Of course you're not linked to the doufi... or even that such distinctions are valid.
No, don't apologize.
I probably do have a doufi orientation.
But behind coolness, isn't there a certain repressing... squashing down, or lack of cultivation of one's humanity?
Oh, so you think that cool people have less humanity?
No, I don't think cool people are entirely inhuman.
Just enough to be cool.
In our society, there's all this propaganda... in favor of uniqueness, eccentricity, et cetera.
But does the world really want or need more of such traits?
Aren't such people usually terrible pains in the neck?
What the world needs to work properly... is a large mass of normal people.
I would like to be one of those.
Sorry.
But you'll still do the part?
Yeah, of course.
So do you know every number...
- ...in every Fred Astaire movie?
- There were two in our school musical.
- I know those.
- Did performing those two numbers... help you overcome feelings of discouragement and despair?
Absolutely.
Freak.
Hey, everybody, let's do the Sambola.
-Look.
-Where?
There.
Yes. I think so.
Hello.
Are you a new student?
-Yes.
-Good.
We thought so.
We'd like to help you.
Help me?
What do you mean?
As a freshman, it can be very tough.
You get to college and it's supposed to be great, but it's not.
University life can be pretty bad.
-There are a lot of suicides.
-Well, attempted ones.
I'm not actually a freshman.
I'm a transfer student.
-Oh, an entering sophomore?
-Yes.
You were unhappy and are looking to recover here.
-Well, I think you will.
-Yes.
Would you welcome that?
Would our help be something you'd appreciate?
Or would you rather sink or swim on your own?
-Either way is fine.
We'll be friends.
-Yes, whichever you'd prefer.
Yes.
Sure.
Great.
We should start immediately.
Clothes can be crucial for confidence and an overall sense of well-being.
-Clothes don't have to be expensive.
-You need friends of the same size.
-You don't like my clothes?
-l'm just saying.
Move it out.
What?
What's wrong?
-What's wrong?
-You didn't notice that?
-No.
What?
-Those guys.
That smell.
That awful, acrid odor.
Have you heard of nasal shock syndrome?
Any harsh, acrid or just disgusting odor sends Rose into nasal shock.
Just from some BO?
"Just some BO"?
Oh, my God, Lily.
You must have a very high threshold for pain.
That'll serve you well at Seven Oaks.
-What do you mean?
-Seven Oaks is notorious for its BO.
It was the last of the Select Seven to go coed.
An atmosphere of male barbarism predominates...
-...but we're going to change that.
-Yes.
Where are you going?
Gotta get to the Housing Department.
They lost my rooming assignment.
That's terrible.
You have no place to stay?
Was it just mislaid?
No, there were more acceptances than they anticipated and not enough rooms to go around, so....
Why don't you stay with us?
Really?
Don't think of this in the old-fashioned sense of going to a party to find someone or not find someone.
That's not the dynamic that we're talking about.
-What dynamic are you talking about?
-Glad you asked.
Our going to a party of this kind is more a form of youth outreach.
-Of what?
-Youth outreach.
It's not just some moronic frat-house social function.
Though it will be that too.
We've gotta keep in mind that these guys are young people.
They're essentially immature and crying out for help and guidance.
-Though they don't know it.
-No, they don't, but we do.
-Aren't they the same age as we are?
-Only numerically.
I'm a lot fatter than you are, but I think we could pin it.
Oh, my gosh, that's beautiful.
Stunning.
Take Frank, my friend.
He's not some cool, handsome, studly macho type.
No, not at all.
I can't stand guys like that.
He's more of a sad sack really, wouldn't you say?
-Definitely.
-What is a sad sack?
A loser.
-You like losers?
-Very much so.
Do you know what's the major problem in social life?
What?
The tendency, widespread, to always seek someone cooler than yourself.
It's always a stretch.
Often a big stretch.
Why not find someone who's inferior?
-Someone like Frank.
-Yes. lt's more rewarding.
And, in fact, quite reassuring.
You mean someone you can help, not just thinking of yourself.
Yes, that's it, precisely.
But without the goody-goody implications.
Our aspirations are pretty basic.
Take a guy who hasn't realized his full potential or doesn't even have much and then help him realize it or find more.
There's enough material here for a lifetime of social work.
What's really worrisome is that that was intentional.
Frank.
Frank, this is Lily.
She's just come to Seven Oaks as a transfer student. lsn't she great?
Lily failed or wasn't happy at her last school.
We're sure that she's going to adapt here.
-ln fact, she already has.
-Oh, good.
Oh, my God.
A golden oldie.
I love these.
-Oh, my gosh.
Wasn't that great?
-That was really fun.
I know that people can have useful careers in many areas.
Medicine, government, law, finance.
-Education.
-Yes, even education.
But I'd like to do something especially significant in my lifetime.
That could change the course of human history.
-Such as starting a new dance craze.
-Really?
Yes.
Something that could improve the lives of every person and every couple.
I'm so proud of what you accomplished last night.
You showed those guys a really good time.
Without anything really bad happening.
That's good.
The guys you know, are they all Greeks?
-What?
-Are all the guys you know Greeks?
Excuse me. I don't understand.
Are all the guys you know Greeks?
-l don't think we know any Greeks.
-Greeks, like frat boys.
Oh, yes.
Fraternities.
You mean members of the Greek-letter fraternities.
Yeah.
Like last night.
Actually, last night we were at the DU house.
DU.
Roman letters.
Not Greek.
Seven Oaks has never had a Greek-letter fraternity system.
It's always been a Roman-letter system here.
It's very different.
-What house is this?
-Oh, this isn't a fraternity.
At least not one anyone should want to join.
You probably think we're frivolous, empty-headed college coeds.
You're probably right.
I often feel empty-headed.
We're trying to make a difference in people's lives.
One way to do that is to stop them from killing themselves.
Have you ever heard of "Prevention is nine-tenths the cure"?
Well, in the case of suicide, it's actually 1 0-tenths the cure.
-Those are clichés, aren't they?
-Yes, they are.
It's interesting you say that. I love clichés and hackneyed expressions.
-Do you know why?
-No.
Because they're largely true.
The hundreds, perhaps thousands of such clichés and hackneyed expressions that our language has bequeathed us are a stunning treasure trove of human insight and knowledge.
-Really?
-Yes.
Oh, please sit down.
During these formative college years we should learn as many clichéd and hackneyed thoughts as possible.
Furthermore, I think we will.
Speaking of suicide prevention, do you have a boyfriend, Lily?
-Are you dating anyone?
-l don't see the connection.
-You don't?
-Boyfriends are a primary suicide risk.
You don't have any particular friend?
No one at all?
No.
Well, there's this grad student I met over summer.
Xavier.
We became pretty good pals.
He has a girlfriend whom I've met.
She's very nice.
"Zavier." With a Z?
-No, I think it's with an X.
-No, I'm certain it's Z.
Zavier, like Zorro.
It's the same sound.
Zorro marked his name with a Z.
It's an X.
But Zorro's with a Z.
Okay, let me see if I can figure this out.
Used at the beginning of a name, Z and X have the same pronunciation.
-But it's Zorro with a Z.
-Actually, there were two Zorros.
One spelled his name with a Z and made a Z mark for Zorro.
And there's Xorro who spelled his name with an X and with his sword he'd make an X mark.
What was really unfair was because he marked his name with X everybody assumed he was illiterate when he was spelling correctly.
-Hello.
-Can we help you?
Of course we can.
No case is too challenging.
-Would you like a doughnut?
-Okay.
Please, sit down.
-Here, have some coffee.
-Thank you.
-What's your name?
-Jim Bose.
-But my friends call me Jimbo.
-Why?
-What?
-Why do your friends call you Jimbo?
Well, it's a contraction of Jim and the first part of my last name, Bose.
Yeah, I got that.
But why bother?
-What do you mean?
-Jim is already a lovely name.
It's short, simple, evocative.
Shouldn't a nickname simplify the name that it replaces?
Jimbo doesn't really simplify anything.
I don't know.
Well, maybe you should ask your friends.
Where do you live or reside?
Doar Dorm.
-Oh, my God.
Yuck.
-What?
-The smell, it's notorious.
-What smell?
You're right, it's more like a stink.
Unclean clothing, I'd say, mostly.
-Vomit.
-Stale beer.
Pot.
Cheap deodorant.
There might be a vermin infestation.
Did you know a good-smelling environment is crucial to our sense of well-being?
Have you tried to find a better-smelling place?
Wait, wait.
It's not me, I'm not depressed.
-You're not?
-No.
Are you sure?
You kind of seem on edge.
-No, I'm fine.
-That's a terrible expression. "Fine."
"l'm fine."
Something smug about it. "l'm fine."
-Why do you say that you're fine?
-l'm not depressed. I'm not suicidal.
Why are you here, then?
Are you a con man?
-A confidence trickster?
-No, there's a girl.
Her boyfriend dumped her.
She was crying but now is silent.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you say so?
We have to go.
Call the cops!
A suicide might be in progress!
-The campus cops?
-Yes, of course the campus cops.
Take this.
We have a lot of students coming to the center pretending to be depressed to get doughnuts.
-Confidence tricksters.
-Yes, it's really bad.
Really cynical.
We pledged to the doughnut company we would only give doughnuts to students who were depressed or otherwise nutty.
We're a nonprofit, so the rules are pretty strict.
-This man could still be a trickster.
-Well, we'll soon find out.
Tell me about this girl.
Well, her name is Priss.
She's very pretty.
Oh, yes. lt's very hard for beautiful women to experience rejection.
Priss?
Priss.
Are you okay?
Priss!
Priss, say something!
Priss!
Open up!
Oh, thank God.
We're gonna have to force this door.
Priss?
Are you okay?
-What?
-Please don't.
Please, come with us.
Do you wanna talk about it?
What was his name?
Josh.
If you'd rather not talk, we don't have to.
No, it's okay, I just....
l keep thinking how he used to gaze at me with such love in his eyes.
You know what I mean?
No.
No, I've never actually seen that.
Yes.
Just days ago, he'd gaze at me.
His eyes, so blue.
He had blue eyes?
So does Frank.
Frank's the guy that I go out with.
Otherwise, he's not conventionally good-looking, which I actually prefer.
Would you describe Josh as handsome?
-That's a problem.
-Could I join you guys?
Yes, please.
Priss and I were just talking.
In my view, handsome men are to be avoided.
I don't even consider good looks to be flattering in a man.
-Do you know what I mean?
-No.
Cookie-cutter, good-looking guys, with their chiseled features running around, full of themselves getting everything they want, never suffering or experiencing--
We suffered?
We're not under discussion.
That's irrelevant.
That's besides the point.
-ls this making you feel any better?
-Yes. I think so.
Good. I hoped it would.
Okay, it's nearly 4 and The Daily Complainer's orientation meeting is about to start and I think we should go.
The editor, Rick DeWolfe, he's terrible.
A real jerk.
Why do you think he's such a jerk?
He's one of those that I was talking about.
Tall.
Probably considers himself very smart and handsome.
A journalist, so you can imagine the mindboggling arrogance and conceit.
-But, Violet, don't you think--?
-What?
Well, don't you think that the way you talk could be considered arrogant too?
I mean, a little?
Yes, of course.
But what's your point?
Wouldn't that be hypocritical, criticizing Rick for something you could be criticized for yourself?
No. I don't see why.
We're all flawed.
Must that render us mute to the flaws of others?
Must we tether ourselves from comment because our natures are human too?
We've got a rebel amongst us.
That's good, I think. lt's good to be challenged and criticized.
I know your intentions are good, it's just--
That's it precisely.
Our intentions are good.
We're seeking to help people rescue their lives from terrible sadness and failure which is a worthy goal, don't you think?
Yes.
But not exactly a humble one.
No.
I agree with you there.
You're right, absolutely.
I'd like to thank you for this chastisement.
-l'm sorry, I didn't mean to chastise.
-No, I think you did and I think it's good.
It's good to have a friend to put one in one's place when that's what one needs.
Now I see that I have that kind of friend in you.
I think that's great.
Hello, people.
Listen up.
People, quiet.
Quiet, people.
Shut up!
Okay, that's better. I'm Rick DeWolfe, editor of The Complainer.
Over the next weeks, I'm the person you're gonna hate most in the world.
You're gonna hate me because I'm gonna work you point out your stupidity and incompetence and do everything in my power to turn you into journalists.
-Albeit barely literate ones.
-Oh, brother.
Any questions?
No?
Yes.
How did The Daily Complainer get its name?
Isn't that pretty obvious?
It comes out every day and it's the university daily.
So The Daily Complainer.
-The Daily--
-No, I meant--
Oh, you mean, why The Complainer?
The name dates from Seven Oaks' earliest days as a divinity school.
The reference is to the Book of Job.
Job's complaint with the world.
Before justice can be achieved, a complaint must be made.
That is what we do and people don't like it a bit.
Right now, what that means is extirpating Seven Oaks' elitist Roman Letter Clubs that are like a cancer on the community.
They're not elitist in the least.
Yes, they are.
Have you met any of their members?
The guys from the DU, for example?
They're barely competent for the tasks of everyday life.
They have to drink a quart of beer just to talk to a woman?
-Two quarts.
-Yet you salivate at the idea of taking the roof off their heads and throwing them on the street where who knows what would happen.
You call yourself a Christian.
-No, I don't.
-What unkindness and cruelty.
This is the darkness in the heart of man, which Joseph Conrad wrote about most eloquently.
-He was actually Polish.
-Oh, my God.
Unkind, self-righteous and pedantic.
In short, a model journalist.
You should know something about these girls.
They run the suicide center where their preferred therapy for depressed and suicidal people is tap dancing.
-l kid you not.
-Tap is a highly effective therapy as well as a dazzlingly expressive dance form that has been sadly neglected for too many years.
It's moronic and barbaric.
You expect tap dancing to solve people's problems?
No, we don't.
We're using the whole range of musical dance numbers which have proven themselves to be effective therapies for the suicidal and the hopelessly depressed.
That really got me down.
-l thought you handled it well.
-You did?
Thanks.
No, it's all this aggression and hostility that gets me down.
Not just his but also my own.
It leaves you feeling unclean.
Have you thought of taking a shower?
Maybe you'd feel better.
You're probably right.
No, there's something else.
What Lily was saying about me being conceited and arrogant.
-l'm sorry.
-No, I think you're right.
I'm really ashamed.
-You're joking.
-No, it's terrible how I've acted.
We're all Christians.
Or I should say Judeo-Christians.
Humility should be our watchword.
The essence of being a good person.
Humility comes from within.
If it's not there in the first place, where do you go to get it?
I stopped looking a long time ago.
Very good, Freak.
-You really think so?
-Yes.
Certainly.
-Five, six, seven, eight.
-Violet.
is it such a good idea to call him Freak?
What?
He's already depressed and you're calling him Freak.
That's his name.
Freak.
Freak Astaire.
That's how he wants to be called.
What are you talking about?
Lily was just saying she likes your dancing.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Are you okay?
What do you mean?
I thought you looked sad and was wondering...
-...if there was anything we could do.
-What could you do?
Oh, I know.
You think I'm gonna kill myself and make you look bad.
No, I'm worried that you'll kill yourself and make yourself look bad.
Do you have any idea how demoralizing it is to be constantly questioned about whether you're suicidal or not?
No.
After a while, you wonder, why is everyone asking me this?
They want me to be suicidal?
Or is it just the consequence of your utter absurdity?
Excuse me.
What scent are you wearing?
-What are you talking about?
-The perfume you're wearing.
I'm not wearing any perfume!
You see, that could be the problem.
-l've become friends with a group.
-Really?
-Although they're perfume-obsessed.
-Oh, them?
Those girls?
The ones who volunteer at the center?
-Yeah.
-But they're terrible.
The blond one?
She's notorious.
-What do you mean?
-Such a bitch.
Terrible, isn't she?
-Would balsamic be okay?
-What?
Balsamic vinegar.
For the dressing.
Yeah, sure.
-What's that?
-What?
-Those.
-Artichokes?
is that what they look like?
Come on, Lily.
You've seen an artichoke before.
-You haven't?
-They look so weird.
I'm not convinced that having a suicide-prevention center prevents any suicides.
Well, the coffee's good.
If someone were determined to destroy themselves...
-...
I don't think they'd stop for coffee.
-lt depends on what it tastes like.
-Where are we going?
-l thought I'd take Priss over to DU.
Why?
It might be helpful for her to meet some of the guys.
How would that be helpful?
They're morons.
-Oh, come on, Lily.
-No, they're morons.
No.
Not medically. I like them.
They're in that sympathetic range of being not good-looking and yet not smart.
There's something likable about that.
Spending time with them, you get the sense that you're making a difference.
For somebody suicidal, like Priss, that could be a real boost.
-l'm not suicidal.
-Oh, that's good.
It's better not to have an identity as a suicidal person, don't you think?
-Well, bye.
-Well....
-Where are you going?
-Over to Xavier's.
-ls that a good idea?
-Why wouldn't it be?
-ls his girlfriend gonna be there?
-Of course.
-Gosh, you're nosy.
-No, no, it's just a general foreboding.
"Foreboding"?
You know, you're absolutely right.
I was being nosy.
Terribly so.
-l've gotta watch that.
-Yes, we must improve ourselves.
-Bye.
-Bye.
Bye.
Lily.
-You were coming over?
-Hey.
Yeah. ls Alice home?
Alice is working.
-Oh, she is?
-But it's not a problem.
It's good you came.
Let's go to the Oak Bar.
I'll buy you a beer.
-l thought Alice would be back.
-l'll call her.
She'll join us there.
Come on.
Okay.
She's actually quite a good person.
Her entire identity revolves around helping people.
You really think that's true?
What's she have against The Complainer?
That's bizarre.
Well, she thinks the editor, Rick DeWolfe, is completely egotistical.
And your friend isn't?
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Hi, Lily.
-Hi.
-Great.
You got the message.
-Yeah.
-Who's egotistical?
-Lily's roommate.
She sounds unbearable.
She's on a rampage against The Complainer.
Really?
Why?
She thinks the editor, Rick DeWolfe, is conceited.
-And, in fact, quite mean.
-Mean?
Yes.
He wants to close the Seven Oaks Roman Letter Clubs.
That's good, isn't it?
Everyone was against them.
-No.
-Come on.
There's no justification for those places.
They're exclusive and elitist.
The point that Violet makes is that they can't be elitist.
-They're morons.
-Yeah, elitist morons.
You'll grant they're morons.
That's a handicap.
Such people should be helped, not hounded and persecuted.
-Persecuted?
-Yes, losing the roof over your head?
That's the worst thing that can happen.
Violet thinks there could be some risk of suicide.
Because some boy might kill himself, Seven Oaks can't do what's right?
It's a factor to be considered.
-Yeah.
-No, it isn't.
You can't set policy that way.
-Excuse me, we didn't order these.
-Compliments of the guy at the bar.
That's a playboy or operator move.
Operators like that are to be avoided.
Why?
It seems generous, sending drinks to people you don't know.
-Drinks are expensive.
-Drinks to two gorgeous girls.
His intention was to seduce and he assumed he could.
-Both?
-That seems a bit harsh.
You don't know what he was thinking.
Was he alone?
Yes.
You see?
He was alone and probably lonely.
He could see that Alice and Lily were students.
Students are known for their intelligent conversation.
They can always talk about their courses.
That was probably what attracted him.
Nonsense.
Perhaps his view was even loftier.
To court Lily with a view to matrimony.
We're in the north, but a southern gentleman can wander into these parts.
Rubbish.
Seeing Lily across a crowded bar filled with the usual undergraduate slobs.
Why wouldn't a thoughtful young man seek her out?
She's lovely.
Isn't it incumbent on men and women to find ways to meet each other?
Buying drinks for a person you don't know seems to be a generous one.
Yes.
Most guys won't even pay for the women they do know.
What you've described is a playboy or operator move.
I'll grant you that it's a tactic or perhaps even a ruse but without some of that, would our species even survive?
The Lord said, "Be fruitful and multiply."
Oh, my gosh.
No, this is how the world works, seeing someone across a room.
This could be the romantic story you tell your grandchildren.
And if you do marry and have children then he'll really learn how to squander cash.
Isn't it good to know that he's basically generous from the start?
Where's Priss?
Your eyes are so striking.
So blue.
-Really?
They're blue?
-Yes.
The most piercing blue.
You must know your eyes are blue.
-No.
-What do you mean?
What?
You must know what color your eyes are.
Your eyes are very blue.
You know that.
I'm not gonna go around checking what color my eyes are.
When you look in the mirror, you see that your eyes are blue.
-Oh, come on.
-What?
I don't think my eyes have a color.
If my eyes are so blue looking out, wouldn't everything be kind of blue?
Like, have a bluish tinge to it?
Doesn't.
Just looks normal.
That's...?
That's blue?
-That color?
-Yes, of course.
Then what color is that?
Green.
You're saying that chair's green but Frank's eyes are blue?
Yes.
Then what color are the walls?
Also green.
You didn't know that?
No.
How's that possible?
You think knowing the colors is so important?
You're in college and you don't know the colors?
Doesn't that embarrass you?
Well, no.
Why should it?
That's why the 'rents are paying big bucks to send me here.
You know, to learn stuff.
Well, gotta go hit the books.
I don't think anyone should feel embarrassed about not knowing stuff.
What's embarrassing is pretending to know.
Or putting people down because you think they don't know as much.
Look, I'm happy to admit I'm completely ignorant.
That's why I'm here and plan to really hit the books.
So the next time you see me, I will know more than I do now.
I'll be older but also wiser.
Or at least know more stuff.
For me, that's education.
Cheers.
Thor's great.
He's very clear about his objectives.
He really wants to learn things.
Frank?
What a jerk.
-He's a monster.
-Oh, my gosh, Violet.
You did everything for them.
They're nothing without you.
-What a rat.
-He's a moron.
-Don't waste a tear on that creep.
-Don't waste a single breath.
-Jerk.
-Stop.
-Please.
-What?
I love Frank.
I love him.
Come on, Violet, Frank's a moron.
You are well rid of him.
-Don't say that.
-Frank's not a moron?
You know, Lily, you're a bit harsh.
This obsession with intelligence.
Do you think it has some magical quality transforming everything?
The intelligence line is not an immutable barrier.
Love can cross it.
You can love someone whose mental capacity is not large.
I know. I have.
-Well, there's a mutable barrier, then.
-Frank's stupid, we knew.
That he's a rat playboy operator, I hadn't realized.
I don't want to turn bitter.
-l worry for Frank. I care about him.
-Well, I'd stop.
No.
I love Frank.
I always will.
If that's the case, why not fight for him?
-Against Priss?
I'd never win.
-Sure you would.
Priss is a rat.
A bitch.
A rat bitch.
Don't blame Priss.
She was crushed when her blue-eyed Josh left her.
I should've known.
Of course she'd fall for Frank.
Josh and Frank are both blue-eyed heartbreakers.
Poor Violet.
She's the roommate who's so self-confident?
Yeah.
But now she's a wreck.
But there's no logic to the algebra of love.
"The algebra of love."
That sounds like the title to some lame book.
It's a title, but the book's not lame at all.
Love's algebra?
I thought it was more geometry.
Okay, the title's not good, but the book is.
What's it say?
Well, that while we're all perverse in our romantic preferences there's actually this logic or algebra to our perversity and it has something to do with how the species has evolved.
-The survival of the species?
-Yes.
And whether it will continue to do so.
No booze?
Just to find the nearest package store, you had to drive 40 miles.
-These aren't so strong.
-No, they're really strong.
I think I'd like another.
-That wouldn't be a good idea.
-Why not?
-Well....
-Are you trying to stifle me?
-Lily?
-Oh, hi.
Listen, we're gonna get something to eat.
Why don't you come with us?
-l'm with Charlie.
-l can see that.
-But you really should come.
-Why?
I just think it would be a good idea.
-But why?
-You really must come. I insist.
Lily?
Lily, are you angry?
Lily, this is it.
We're here.
What's the matter?
That was so rude.
He's a nice guy and you embarrassed him.
He's not nice.
He was trying to get you drunk.
-No, he wasn't.
-Plying you with martinis?
-l was plying myself with martinis.
-Come on, the guy's a total sleaze.
-A creep.
-You don't know anything about him.
The way he sent drinks over to our table?
Alice.
Alice, what's wrong?
I had no idea that Xavier could be so mean.
Sounds as if he was just trying to protect you.
This Charlie Walker sounds like an operator or playboy type.
No, he's not like that.
He's actually a really nice guy.
I thought he was a slick businessman.
No.
He dresses well, but he works in strategic development.
-What?
-Strategic development.
He works at SDA.
Strategic Development Associates.
-He's an associate there.
-What he is, is a strategic operator.
Violet, are you okay?
Hey, miss, rain's coming!
Better get back!
-Polly, have you seen Violet?
-No. ls something wrong?
We're not sure.
Violet!
-Violet!
-Violet!
Oh, my gosh, what happened?
I don't understand.
What were you doing?
How long were you gone for?
I'm sorry, I don't know.
I lost track of time.
But you feel better now?
Well, cleaner.
She'll say anything to get in the show.
-She'll want doughnuts.
-You don't have to be suicidal...
-...to get doughnuts, just depressed.
-Clinically depressed.
From a clinic.
-Would you say you're depressed?
-l don't like the term.
-l prefer to say I'm in a tailspin.
-Oh, my God.
A tailspin?
She can't even say she's depressed.
She's gotta say something special.
Priss was honest.
She was depressed and she had a right to be in the show.
Now every silly tailspinner's trying to get in.
-The show is for everyone.
-No, it isn't, Freak.
To be in the center's programs, you have to be clinically depressed.
That means that you've been to a clinic and they've said that you're depressed.
Have you been to a clinic?
Have you been to a clinic?
Then you're not clinically depressed.
Violet.
Violet.
What is it?
Where are you going?
All I wanted was to make Frank happy.
I had all these plans.
Things we could've done together.
I never even got to tell him.
Hey!
Where all your boyfriends at?
Come on!
They don't wear bikinis.
They're ladies, they wear thongs.
I can't imagine where she could've gone.
Wherever she went, she should be back by now.
How did she seem when you last saw her?
Really sad about Frank.
-Still?
-Yeah.
How can someone so smart continue mooning over a dope like that?
People aren't exactly as you assume.
The Violet you know bears little resemblance to the girl I met in seventh grade.
-You met Violet in seventh grade?
-Well, her name wasn't Violet then.
What's your name?
You can tell us your name.
We won't bite.
What's your name?
Tell us.
Are you retarded?
Tell us your name.
Emily Tweeter.
-Tweeter?
Like a bird?
-That's ridiculous.
Tweeter?
Like a bird?
-Not an easy name to have at that age.
-Not at any age.
What was she like?
Timid.
Bookish.
Classic scholarship student.
Her parents were writers.
They didn't have a dime.
Finances were the least of her worries.
-What do you mean?
-Well, she was crazy.
I got stuck rooming with her on a trip when no one else would.
-lt was awful.
-Did she smell bad?
No.
Obsessive cleanliness was part of her insanity.
-You were nice to her.
-No.
The idea of being nice to weird kids hadn't arrived.
-Why was she so unpopular?
-Well, she was very strange.
Constantly setting herself odd, repetitive tasks.
Tasks?
For example, on that trip she had with her a little square suitcase.
The idea came into her head she had to move it in a precise pattern over and over again and if she didn't execute this movement flawlessly 1 0 times she'd start over.
Another was to slide her hand across her forehead trying not to touch her hair or eyebrows on either side also repeating it 1 0 times.
Any niggling thought she'd touched the hair, she'd start over.
-My God, that is insane.
-Why would she do that?
She had the conviction that if she didn't complete these tasks her parents would die.
-Was she Catholic?
-No.
But what made the whole thing really sad was that her parents did die.
Oh, my God.
Violet!
Violet?
Violet!
Violet, where are you?
Something's wrong, isn't it, dear?
You mind my asking?
Well, I do mind a little.
-Excuse me, Your Highness.
-l'm sorry.
-lt's just kind of awkward to talk about.
-No matter.
I hope you haven't come to get run over on the highway.
-What do you mean?
-Suicides.
They come down from the university.
Jump out in the road.
Get hit by the blind curve.
Hope you're not one of them.
Do I look like one of them?
I don't know.
Maybe.
Messy people, suicides.
Think only of themselves and their own deaths.
Not what comes after.
They leave quite a mess.
They don't stick around to clean it up.
So you're not one of those depressed students from the university?
I don't like the word "depressed." l prefer to say that I'm in a tailspin.
A tailspin?
-Does this tailspin involve a man?
-Yes, it does.
But I'm not as crazy as I was up till yesterday.
Apparently that's due to the salutary effect of scent on the human psyche.
Its importance is, I believe, almost incalculable.
At the motel, I happened to use this soap.
It was provided to me as a courtesy as one of the guests.
That an economical motel would provide such good soap is quite unusual.
-The scent is very precise.
-Really?
Tell me if it provokes any particular reaction in your psyche.
A state of mind.
I always knew she was unstable.
They're gonna have her photo at the registrar's.
Violet!
Violet!
You're back!
You're okay!
Not really.
Oh, my gosh, Violet, we were so worried.
Why didn't you tell us or leave a note?
I did leave a note.
Would that be a suicide note?
-l wouldn't leave without a note.
-Where did you go?
I took the train to Villafranca and checked into a motel there.
-The Motel 6?
-No, the Motel 4.
-lt's even less expensive.
-The Motel 4 in Villafranca?
-My God, you really were suicidal.
-Why'd you go?
I had to do something.
And you really thought you were gonna find the answer in Villafranca?
I'm not sure what I expected, but I might have found it.
What?
Soap?
This scent and this soap is what gives me hope.
Hello?
is anyone here?
Hello?
Lily?
-Hello?
-Oh, my gosh.
I couldn't understand where everyone was.
Sorry, I just went out to get some things.
-Where's Alice?
-Gone.
What do you mean?
Left.
We broke up.
-But when you called, you said-- -l know, I'm sorry.
I thought it better to tell you in person.
Alice couldn't control her jealousy.
It completely overwhelmed her.
Really?
What was she jealous of?
Come on.
No, what?
You.
After a while, I just couldn't handle it.
Things became impossible.
She was jealous of me?
Of course.
Would it be okay if we watch a film?
Yes.
What would you like to see?
I thought maybe Truffaut's Baisers volés.
Stolen Kisses.
Do you know it?
No, is it new?
It's a classic of French New Wave cinema.
I think you'll like it.
-But it's in color?
-Yeah.
-You don't know Truffaut?
-No.
Do you know Godard, Á bout de souffle?
-Why was Alice so jealous?
-What do you think?
She was jealous because Lily's lovely.
I don't know.
They had a lot of problems.
Of course.
You wouldn't break up a happy couple.
-What's that?
-A note Frank left.
-Really?
Recently?
-No, when we were together.
Now that most correspondence is electronic it's rare to be left anything written by hand.
Frank can write by hand?
-What is it?
-lt's not very important.
It's just all I have.
-What's it say?
-"Out for brewskis.
Back in a giff."
What's a "giff"?
One of those little motor scooters, isn't it?
I'm sure he meant to write "jiff" with a J. "Back in a jiff."
But he wrote "giff."
-Could Frank be dyslexic?
-No.
Dyslexics are intelligent.
-What's that?
-Frank's bean ball.
-He gave you his bean ball?
-Not exactly.
This is an extra.
He thought he'd leave it here just in case he lost his other one.
Gosh, Violet, you've really gotta stop thinking about Frank.
Why?
I don't wanna stop thinking about him.
Recently I had a thought that cheered me up a lot.
Life is like a long, flowing river and as a long, flowing river, some debris you never expect to see again is almost certain to reappear floating to the surface.
Frank and I may very well be together again one day.
Maybe it'll take years, but somewhere down the line he's very likely to pop up again, and I'll be there to catch him.
I don't think we've spoken about this.
What?
Have you been to the south of France?
To the walled city of Carcassonne?
-l've never been anywhere.
-But you've seen pictures of it.
No, I don't think so.
Oh, it's fascinating.
-l'd like to visit.
-You never studied the Cathars?
They were a religious movement very idealistic located mostly in the southwest of France that the Catholic Church repressed.
Oh, my God.
The Catholic Church is, like, always bad.
Ideas can't be killed as easily as people.
Especially such enlightened ones as the Cathars held.
In recent years, more and more people have returned to their beliefs.
So you're a Cathar?
Yes. I aspire to be.
I'm trying to follow the path the Cathars marked out.
That's so impressive.
I can tell you we didn't have any Cathars back home.
I think you'd be surprised.
In the Cathar view the highest form of lovemaking avoids procreation entirely.
Sure.
Condoms, right?
Well, according to Cathar ideas sex with condoms is just a parody of the procreative act.
What do you mean?
The standard, cliché form of sexual intercourse is for the man to approach a woman from the front.
Cathar lovemaking, I think you'll find very fulfilling.
I'll be very careful, we'll go slowly.
It'll be a new experience but one which I think you'll find brings an inexpressible closeness.
Might your drinks-buying friend be around?
It would be great to get complimentary cocktails.
-Charlie?
No.
-Do you still see him at all?
-He calls from time to time.
-He does?
-Why don't you introduce us?
-Why should I introduce you?
Because you know him, and we don't.
So?
"So?"
"So" is probably the unkindest word in the English language.
I can't bear it. I think it should be outlawed. "So."
You're crazy.
Come on, Lily, you have Xavier.
-You can't keep two guys for yourself.
-Guys do that all the time.
We're not guys, fortunately.
It's unconscionable for you not to bring him and introduce us.
Charlie is a friend.
He's a nice guy.
What do you mean?
I hate to think what'd happen if you got your claws into him.
That's outrageous.
We're perfectly nice.
We've met lots of pathetic guys and nothing bad's happened.
-Charlie's not pathetic.
-Well, all the better, then.
The Roman Holidays will be coming soon.
-What's that?
-A festival Roman Letter Clubs put on.
A kind of moron jamboree.
The Roman elements are the worship of Bacchus, Beerus and Blotto.
-lt could've all been so uplifting.
-Charlie.
Hey, Charlie.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
-Have you the day off?
-Yeah.
This is my friend Charlie, whom I think I've mentioned.
And, Charlie, these are my roommates.
This is....
This is Rose.
And this is Heather.
And Violet.
Charlie works for Strategic Development Associates.
He's an associate there.
You work in strategic development?
-You've heard of it?
-Of course, yes.
My cousin Jay in Philadelphia works in strategic development.
Something business-related?
Mostly business, but any kind of organization.
-Only businesses pay the big bucks.
-Nonprofits and government pay well.
That's how they keep from having profits by paying lots of money to companies like yours.
Excuse me, but aren't you in Professor Ryan's course at the Ed School?
No.
You're not in Professor Ryan's Flit Lit course?
No.
-Flit Lit?
-The dandy tradition in literature.
-l'm sure I've seen you there.
-Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm not in any courses at the Ed School.
Good to meet you.
-lt was great to see you.
-Bye.
God, Violet, what was that about?
That guy is definitely in Professor Ryan's class.
Not possible.
He has a fulltime job for Strategic Development Associates.
He never got his coffee.
-Why lie about something like that?
-He's lying.
I find that very attractive.
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna stop cutting Professor Ryan's class.
It can be argued that Firbank was too little disciplined too unserious in his unseriousness to create works of enduring value.
But as a liberating influence on later writers such as Waugh his importance should not be discounted.
It's not Firbank's work itself but the idea of his work that so helped later writers as Thomas Love Peacock did in the previous century.
I'm not gonna come anymore.
-What a waste of time.
-Charlie.
Charlie.
-Charlie?
-Charlie, you are taking the course.
Charlie?
Who's Charlie?
-Fred, what's going on?
-Fred?
Fred. sounds like you got some explaining to do.
-Well, you were lying.
-l wasn't lying, I was making it up.
Why were you making it up?
If you were an eighth-year Ed School student, would you advertise that?
Eighth year. impressive.
But your whole life was a lie.
Dressing up in suits.
Buying people drinks.
The suits were real.
The drinks, real.
Not just drinks for people.
They were for cute girls.
There's a perfectly rational, easily explainable agenda.
So it was a playboy or operator move.
-Of course.
Transparently so.
-l admire that.
Drinks are expensive.
But strategic development, that was made up too?
-You said your cousin Jay was in it.
-What cousin Jay?
-ln Philadelphia.
-l don't have a cousin in Philadelphia.
You said your cousin Jay was working in strategic development.
I was just saying that to be friendly.
To make a kind of link.
-So your name's Fred something?
-Yes.
Fred something.
-Packenstacker?
-Oh, my God.
How crazy.
He's completely insane.
I almost dated him.
-You can say that about a lot of guys.
-l don't think he's crazy.
Making up an entirely fictitious identity, that's not crazy?
-lt's insane. it's psycho.
-Violet's identity is made up.
-l don't think she's crazy.
-No, I am.
No, this is different.
It's crazy and pathetic.
All that about strategic development he just made up.
Don't tell me that's not weird.
I've heard of strategic development.
I think it's something pretty important.
Violet, you're not gonna start going out with him.
You're not, are you?
Well, we had planned to go to the library.
-Not to the stacks, I hope.
-Yes.
Oh, my gosh, do you realize how dangerous that is?
-Dangerous?
-Yes, the stacks.
They're dark and deserted.
Anything could happen.
It's true.
With the study habits at Seven Oaks your body won't be found until spring.
Promise you won't go with him to the stacks.
Please.
Okay. I'll suggest the Randall Room.
-Don't suggest. insist.
-And please not at night.
Okay.
What are you reading?
Have you chosen a topic for your final paper?
The decline of decadence.
You think that decadence has declined?
Definitely.
Bigtime.
Major, major decline.
How?
How or in what ways?
Either.
Well, take the flit movement in literature, or homosexuality.
It's gone completely downhill, right down the tubes.
What do you mean?
Before, homosexuality was something refined, hidden aspiring to the highest levels of creativity and often achieving it.
Now it seems to be musclebound morons running around in T-shirts.
It's pretty disillusioning.
Are you gay?
Not especially, but in another era, it might have had some appeal.
-Now I just don't see the point.
-You might be romanticizing the past.
We'll never know.
The past is gone, so we might as well romanticize it.
You could be right.
I wanted to ask, how's Lily?
Lily.
She's okay.
Here, check it out.
A.L.A. Nope.
Hello.
Good afternoon.
Check it out.
The A.L.A. Heard of it?
We have a meeting on Tuesday.
-You should come by.
-What is the A.L.A.?
Just join us.
Come Tuesday.
I think you'll really like it.
So....
A fellow was passing these out, and invited us to a meeting on Tuesday.
The A.L.A.?
Oh, my God.
I thought it was something related.
No?
The A.L.A. has got nothing to do with us.
Can't you see that?
The way we express love has meaning.
It's in the context of something beautiful.
We're following our creator's teaching.
Aspiring to an ideal.
A beautiful one that brings an inexpressible closeness.
Not just to each other, but....
For the A.L.A., and those like them the love act is just hedonistic pleasure-seeking of a perverted nature.
I can't believe you'd think we had anything in common with them.
We don't.
Nothing, not an iota.
My God, can't you see that?
Lily.
Lily, come back.
Please.
Don't be that way.
-Oh, my gosh, Lily.
Are you okay?
-lt's all right.
You don't wanna talk about it?
I don't understand.
-You don't understand what?
-What is non-procreative lovemaking?
-lt could be a lot of things.
-Yeah, but in this case?
-We don't have to talk about this.
-l don't mind.
Could somebody explain what this is about?
Well, if--
Cathars don't believe in procreative sex.
They don't have intercourse the usual way.
The usual way?
-You don't have to talk about this.
-No, it's okay.
It's the normal way, from the front where you can have procreation not from the other side, where you can't.
The other side?
That's their religion?
No, but it's the direction their beliefs head in.
When they express love, that's what they do.
How horrible.
You poor girl.
What?
That's terrible what he obliged Lily to do.
Violet.
Can we talk?
You must be pretty mad at me.
No.
You're not?
Not really.
But it was so terrible how everything happened.
Your walking in on us.
Maybe it's easier that way.
That bitch!
I can't believe it. what a bitch.
-Priss?
-Of course Priss.
"l'm so stressed.
Sad.
Depressed.
I'm so tired. I'm fatigued."
She was so depressed she had to get everything her own way.
"l'm so stressed.
Frantic."
Man.
What a bitch.
Priss dumped you?
No. lt was mutual.
Oh, listen, I have a question.
You remember that bean ball that I left in your room?
Yeah.
Do you still have it?
Yeah.
Do you think I could get it back?
I lost the other one, and with everything that's happened I'd really like to have it.
Nothing like some bean ball after a breakup.
Yeah.
God, you're smart.
You always get it.
Whatever I say you understand.
Man.
Hey, Heather.
-Hey.
-Hey.
Hey.
Violet.
Violet, what's wrong?
I'm sorry.
Lily's lovely.
Now she's free.
Go. I understand.
Latin!
Et cetera!
-Yeah!
-Yeah!
This is what comes from not teaching Latin in the schools.
Yeah, it's moronic and boorish, but it's also kind of fun, don't you think?
No.
What's that stench?
I suppose this is what happens when decadence rots society from within.
And from without.
Such a society is, I fear destined to fail and be overrun.
Maybe that's good.
Finally. it's about time those cesspools were drained.
What color would you say that chair is?
That's a chair?
I have no idea.
-Guys have preferences.
-You're going to accept that?
-You're not going to do anything?
-There's nothing to be done.
-Fred must know his own mind.
-Oh, really?
-l seriously doubt that.
-Come on.
Lily's got that slender, delicately swelling beauty...
-...that no man can resist.
-Okay, you're probably right.
Poor Lily.
Just think of all Xavier put her through.
He just used her body.
And not even the right side.
Have you noticed that good people tend to have large posteriors?
Not everyone, by any means.
I know it's not logical.
But it does seem to be true.
The genetic link between morality and large posteriors?
Yes, I think that's well known.
You and Violet have that build.
It's nice.
You're still very attractive, but also sensible and moralistic.
I don't. I have narrow hips, but also no very strong principles.
Yes?
Oh, hi.
-Hi, Frank.
-Hey, Heather.
So I guess you guys all heard.
University's closing all the Roman Letter Houses.
Sorry.
This year's Roman Holidays did seem like the end of civilization but when civilization ends people are going to need a place to stay.
Man.
It's bad.
It's that bastard from The Complainer.
Someone from the administration's been reading it.
Hard to believe.
Bastard.
Listen we were wondering if you thought it would be okay if we stayed at the suicide center.
Okay, sure.
That sounds like a good stopgap measure.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So there's one more thing.
Remember that bean ball we talked about?
Yes.
You think I could pick that up?
Just after everything that's happened, it-- l could really use it right now.
Yes.
-What's that?
-What?
The note.
One gets so few things written by hand anymore, I guess I kept it.
"Out for brewskis, back in a giff."
What's a giff?
It's the scooter.
Like a Vespa, right?
-That's what I thought.
-l was thinking about getting one.
You must've meant "jiff." "Back in a jiff."
And then misspelled it, or spelled it in a nonstandard way.
Yeah.
Not a good speller.
Thanks.
You're great.
Priss was such a bitch.
Damn.
Hey, Heather.
Bye.
-Bye.
-Bye.
Heather is really cute.
She going out with anyone?
There might be something between her and Thor.
Thor?
Damn.
Heather and Thor?
Damn.
I'm worried about Thor.
It's hard for us to imagine how upsetting it is not knowing the colors.
It's impossible for me to imagine.
When Thor sees a rainbow, it's so much gibberish to him.
There was one this afternoon.
Oh, my gosh, he took it hard.
Recently, there was a parade in the city where the marchers carried rainbow-colored flags and banners.
Thor was so upset.
He had no idea what it meant.
What kind of retard is he?
See, that's the conclusion people jump to.
-Well, it is somewhat understandable.
-Not if you knew the full story.
What's the full story?
You know how parents love bragging about how precocious their children are?
Thor's parents had become precocity addicts constantly needing an ever-greater precocity fix.
He should've entered kindergarten.
They pushed him into first grade.
"Thor skipped a grade," they could tell.
What Thor's parents failed to consider is the work done in nursery school.
Key being the study of colors.
I suppose they just assumed that colors are knowledge people pick up.
Like, for example, not stepping on sidewalk cracks.
What's that?
I think Rose is sleeping.
Am I boring?
No, not at all.
When you have problems, it's great to hear someone else's idiotic ones.
Please go on.
-What?
-What you said about depressed people being mean, you weren't joking.
I'm sorry, you're right.
Please go on.
No.
I'm sorry.
You know how I am.
Please continue.
Thor decided he absolutely had to learn all the colors.
Both primary and mixed.
He's been hitting the books hard, and thought he'd mastered them.
Then, in town, he said, "That traffic light's blue."
I had to say, "No, it's green."
He was really upset.
Oh, hi, Lily.
Hi.
We were worried about you.
I can't bear this tension with Lily.
It's terrible to have the group divided this way.
Better not next to Robertson.
What?
Didn't you hear?
Ed students have been going up to the roof and throwing themselves off.
-But it's only two stories.
-Yes, I know.
It's terrible.
Not high enough to kill, but high enough to maim.
And particularly dangerous for anyone below.
I've got to forget about Fred.
But you really liked him.
This whole thing of a person meeting someone else first, it's so arbitrary.
-lt's terrible and cruel.
-l have to say, I was wrong about Fred.
I thought he was a playboy or operator type.
In fact, he's just another guy rendered helpless...
-...by the attentions of a pretty girl.
-Cary!
No, don't!
I love you!
-Why did you do that?
-Oh, my God!
Cary, I love you!
Isn't the Ed School essentially a teacher's college?
Yeah.
If they can't even destroy themselves how are they going to teach America's youth?
-What do you think you're doing?
-Sorry.
Did I disturb you?
Why are you wearing tap shoes?
You out of your mind?
-l think that's pretty clear.
-l'm so sick of that.
Oh, really?
I think it's cute.
Since you won't be treating us to one of your incompetent tap routines...
-...why don't you take those things off?
-No.
We'll do the routine.
Rose.
-Madge wants to see the routine.
-l don't want to see your routine.
-l asked you to take those off.
-We need a break.
Just briefly, please.
It's helpful to have an audience.
Rose, the music.
I'm gonna report you.
Suzanne.
For me, it'd be Madame Curie, Simone de Beauvoir...
-...and Margaret Sanger.
-Good.
Violet.
I would say Richard Strauss, Roderick Charleston and Chubbard Checker.
-Richard Strauss?
The composer?
-Yes, that was one of his posts.
I'm not familiar with the others.
Could you tell us who they are?
Yes.
Each one of these men started an international dance craze.
Richard Strauss, the waltz.
Roderick Charleston, the Charleston.
Chubbard Checker, known as Chubby the dance we know as the twist.
Why do you consider a dance craze important?
Dance crazes enhance and elevate the human experience bringing together millions of people in a joyous celebration of our God-given faculties and passing these modes of physical expression down through the generations.
Though not so much anymore.
I thought-- Well, I assumed that the Charleston was named after the city of Charleston.
No.
Though that misconception is quite widely held.
It was Roderick Charleston.
Usually, behind some great creative phenomenon there's a person, not a town.
This is so exciting.
It's really great, isn't it?
-Hey, could you guys help?
-Sure.
What's up?
We need help packing soap which we'll distribute to Doar Dorm residents.
Cool.
What would you say are effective means to fight depression?
Maybe some of your DU brothers have an idea?
-Beer?
-No.
Beer's a downer.
Cocktails.
Hard liquor and spirits is what really gives you a lift.
It's interesting what you say.
My cousin Jay is a medical officer in Philadelphia.
He says that alcoholism by which I mean chronic, excessive consumption of alcohol is the primary self-administered treatment for depression.
-Cool.
-No.
It leaves you much worse off than before.
Oh, no, not me.
I just boot and then I feel fine.
-By "boot" do you mean vomit?
-Yes.
No.
None of the effective anti-suicide treatments involve vomiting.
-Hygiene?
-Exactly.
It's very important.
That's why we have such hope in the wonder bar.
Do you know its scent?
Transformative, we think.
This is so exciting.
When should we go over there?
-l don't think there's any rush.
-l'd like to go soon.
Doar Dorm has the highest fatality rate, as well as the worst hygiene.
Highest suicide rate.
Fatality rate. lt's uncertain what percentage were intentional and how many were just due to unawareness of gravity's laws.
I can just see those guys getting the gold packages, opening them and finding the good-smelling soap inside.
The cute packaging should prove irresistible.
And once clean, they'll start to see the world with new eyes.
The change could be dramatic.
Doar Dorm could soon become Dior Dorm.
I doubt that, to be perfectly, absolutely honest.
I love the idea.
Dior Dorm.
I adore optimism, even when it's completely absurd.
-Perhaps especially then.
-Great.
Ready?
Let's go.
Let's hurry.
Let's not get our hopes up too high, Heather.
No, you said yourself, the wonder bar is transformative.
-Hey, Violet.
Hi.
-Hi.
-Where you going?
-Doar Dorm.
-Fred, hi.
-Hey.
Good one.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
I guess it wasn't realistic to expect Doar Dorm to turn into Dior Dorm overnight.
They wouldn't even open them.
They said without the soap, the discs wouldn't fly properly.
Are you coming Friday?
Violet's launching her dance craze.
Oh, really?
That's great.
-What's the dance?
-The Sambola.
The devil's dance.
-Oh, cool.
We'll go, right?
-Yes, I'd like to.
But I have several papers to finish.
But I'd like to.
Great.
Thanks, Gus.
I don't see how we're going to start a dance craze if no guys show up.
Most guys aren't very good with the dance-craze thing.
Very good news. I was just in my procrastination seminar and the two guys from Doar Dorm had showered.
It was clear they'd used soap.
Oh, my gosh, what a difference.
Seems they'd been throwing packages so energetically, a soap bar fell out.
The unfamiliar ivory-like object intrigued them and one thing led to another, and, well.... lt was just as you said.
Isn't that great?
-Oh, look, here's Jimbo.
-Jimbo doesn't count.
Where is everybody?
Aren't we gonna be late for Violet's dance craze?
You wanna go to that?
Yeah.
-You're kidding.
-No, I love dance crazes.
Gosh, you're strange.
But aren't we already late?
No, it's later on.
Like 1 0, I think.
I have to confess, I've started losing patience with Violet.
Depression calls for serious treatment.
Medication.
Psychopharmaceuticals.
Talk therapy.
Are those approaches effective?
Despite the medication and therapy Ed School students are still throwing themselves off Robertson Hall.
Violet's ideas might seem a little offbeat--
A little?
Oh, my God. I don't know how much you know about Violet but there's some pretty weird stuff.
You know, Violet.
Violet Wister.
It's not even her real name.
-lt isn't?
-No, it's Emily Tweeter.
When she was 1 1 , she went completely crazy and has had several relapses since.
So it's a little worrisome to have her counsel nearly suicidal individuals.
I can't believe it.
-What?
-Emily Tweeter.
In first grade, I had an enormous crush on a girl with that name.
-And you remember that?
-Yeah.
Pretty huge Dr. Zhivago stuff.
Any idea or even mention of her filled me with emotion.
I had a strange perspective on the world.
I don't think my brain was functioning properly.
Everything was a bit of a dream.
You think this was Violet?
You have any idea if Violet attended willamette Montessori?
In Portland?
-We didn't order these.
-Compliments of the guy at the bar.
It was so brutal how it ended between us.
I know I was too angry and a bit crazy but I thought that what we had was stronger than that.
That you would not just walk away after one disagreement.
It wasn't just that.
You mean my Cathar beliefs.
Well I am no longer a Cathar.
How is that possible?
It's been very difficult.
You've dropped your adherence to the Cathar faith?
-Yes, I have.
-Good.
Normally I'd be reluctant to comment on anyone's religion, but....
What?
I'm sorry. I guess-- l guess I'm a bit of a bigot. I just-- l could never take seriously any religion that worships on Tuesdays.
Major religions require worship on the weekend.
Friday, Saturday or Sunday.
I find it just really laudatory that people sacrifice their weekend time to worship God.
Having the Sabbath on Tuesday always seemed very bizarre to me.
It's not right.
You know what?
We'd better get to the Lone Star.
Why are you so concerned about that?
Well, it's not as if international dance crazes start every day.
We'd better hurry.
What's wrong?
Another fiasco.
Sometimes our struggle reminds me of the myth of Sisyphus.
-Who?
-The myth about the guy who pushes an enormous rock only to have it keep rolling back.
Oh, yeah.
What a knucklehead.
The important thing to remember is that he was mythical.
He never really existed.
Violet?
Did you spend any part of your education at Willamette Montessori?
In Oregon?
Why?
Sound like "tweaker."
Would you say today is very gray?
I'd say so.
Maybe blue-gray.
Yeah, no, that rings a bell now.
Bye.
I'm sorry.
Her name wasn't Emily Tweeter, but Lucy Wurlitzer.
They're not similar. I'm beginning to realize that the human memory is not the foolproof instrument we sometimes imagine.
What's worse, everyone knew about my obsession, including my parents those from whom I most wanted it kept.
So from your earliest years, you were already a playboy or operator type?
Yes. I suppose that's why secrecy seemed so desirable.
Violet, can we talk?
-What's the plural of doofus?
-Doufi.
Not doofuses?
You can say either.
"Doufi" respects the Latin root and is preferred.
"Doofuses" is also correct, although a bit inelegant.
-You've thought a lot about this.
-Yes, I've had to.
Why?
What is it?
I like Fred, he's a nice guy.
And I can see why you like him.
When I first met you and Rose, I thought you were the cool crowd.
And in many ways you are. I find your perfume and fashion sense excellent.
Thank you.
But there's a reason, I think why you are so strongly attracted to doufi.
And it's not an accident how different groups divide up.
Isn't that a rainbow?
-That's a rainbow!
-Thor.
No, Thor!
Thor, no!
Stop!
Please, stop!
He's headed for Robertson Hall!
Red.
Orange.
Yellow.
Green.
Blue. Indigo.
Hallelujah!
Lord God, thank you.
Education.
Education.
We can learn the subjects we set out to master no matter how hard or impossible they may seem.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I wasn't sure I was gonna make it.
Magenta.
Pink.
Mauve.
I miss my nice American friend.
No, you're mistaken.
-You go to London for four weeks?
-Six.
It's dangerous, parents letting children travel.
They send them off and they don't know what they'll be getting back.
I don't know what you're referring to.
You're not from London.
I'm from London.
I was there, now I'm here.
I'm from London.
I just miss my nice American friend.
Nice?
Nice?
Fine. I'm fine.
Those are not adjectives I like to use.
God gave us abilities.
He requires that we use them.
Good, better, best, excelsior, higher.
Only excellence can glorify the Lord.
Vulgarity is, in essence, blasphemous.
I'm sorry for what I was saying before.
Of course you're not linked to the doufi or even that such distinctions are valid.
No, don't apologize.
I probably do have a doufi orientation.
But behind coolness, isn't there a certain repressing squashing down, or lack of cultivation of one's humanity?
Oh, so you think that cool people have less humanity?
No, I don't think cool people are entirely inhuman.
Just enough to be cool.
In our society, there's all this propaganda in favor of uniqueness, eccentricity, et cetera.
But does the world really want or need more of such traits?
Aren't such people usually terrible pains in the neck?
What the world needs to work properly is a large mass of normal people.
I would like to be one of those.
Sorry.
But you'll still do the part?
Yeah, of course.
So do you know every number...
-...in every Fred Astaire movie?
-There were two in our school musical.
-l know those.
-Did performing those two numbers help you overcome feelings of discouragement and despair?
Absolutely.
Freak.
Hey, everybody, let's do the Sambola.
Subs by SyncBoss
Look.
Where?
There.
Yes.
I think so.
Hello.
Are you a new student?
Yes.
Good.
We thought so.
We'd like to help you.
Help me?
Uh...
What do you mean?
As a freshman, it can be very tough.
You get to college and it's supposed to be great, but it's not.
University life can be pretty bad.
There are a lot of suicides.
Well, attempted ones.
I'm not actually a freshman.
I'm a transfer student.
Oh, an entering sophomore?
Yes.
You were unappy and are looking to recover here.
Well, I think you will.
Yes.
Would you welcome that?
Would our help be something you'd appreciate?
Or would you rather sink or swim on your own?
Either way is fine.
We'll be friends.
Yes, whichever you'd prefer.
Yes.
Sure.
Great.
Heh.
We should start immediately.
Clothes can be crucial for confidence and an overall sense of well-being.
Clothes don't have to be expensive.
You need friends of the same size.
You don't like my clothes?
I'm just saying.
Move it out.
What?
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
You didn't notice that?
No.
What?
Those guys.
That smell.
That awful, acrid odour.
Have you heard of nasal shock syndrome?
Any harsh, acrid or just disgusting odour sends Rose into nasal shock.
Just from some BO?
"Just some BO"?
Oh, my God, Lily.
You must have a very high threshold for pain.
That'll serve you well at Seven Oaks.
What do you mean?
Seven Oaks is notorious for its BO.
It was the last of the Select Seven to go coed.
An atmosphere of male barbarism predominates, but we're going to change that.
Yes.
Where are you going?
Gotta get to the Housing Department.
They lost my rooming assignment.
That's terrible.
You have no place to stay?
Was it just mislaid?
No, there were more acceptances than they anticipated, and not enough rooms to go around, so...
Why don't you stay with us?
Really?
Don't think of this in the old-fashioned sense of going to a party to find someone or not find someone.
That's not the dynamic that we're talking about.
What dynamic are you talking about?
Glad you asked.
Our going to a party of this kind is more a form of youth outreach.
Of what?
Youth outreach.
It's not just some moronic frat-house social function.
Though it will be that too.
We've gotta keep in mind that these guys are young people.
They're essentially immature and crying out for help and guidance.
Though they don't know it.
No, they don't, but we do.
Arert they the same age as we are?
Only numerically.
I'm a lot fatter than you are, but I think we could pin it.
Oh, my gosh, that's beautiful.
Ooh la la.
Stunning.
Take Frank, my friend.
He's not some cool, handsome, studly macho type.
No, not at all.
I can't stand guys like that.
He's more of a sad sack really, wouldn't you say?
Definitely.
What is a sad sack?
A loser.
You like losers?
Very much so.
Do you know what's the major problem in social life?
What?
The tendency, widespread, to always seek someone cooler than yourself.
It's always a stretch.
Often a big stretch.
Why not find someone who's inferior?
Someone like Frank.
Yes.
It's more rewarding.
And, in fact, quite reassuring.
You mean someone you can help, not just thinking of yourself.
Yes, that's it, precisely.
But without the goody-goody implications.
Our aspirations are pretty basic.
Take a guy who hasn't realised his full potential or doesn't even have much, and then help him realise it or find more.
There's enough material here for a lifetime of social work.
What's really worrisome is that that was intentional.
Frank.
Mm.
Frank, this is Lily.
She's just come to Seven Oaks as a transfer student.
Isn't she great?
Lily failed or wasrt happy at her last school.
We're sure that she's going to adapt here.
In fact, she already has.
Oh, good.
# Another night Another dream #
Oh, my God.
A golden oldie.
I love these.
# Another night Another dream but always you #
# In the night I dream of love So true #
# Just another night Another vision of love #
# You feel joy, you feel pain 'Cause nothing will be the same #
# Just another night Is all that it tak es #
# To understand the difference Between lovers and fak es #
# So baby, I talk, talk I talk to you #
# In the night in your dream Of love so true #
# I talk, talk I talk to you #
Oh, my gosh.
Wasrt that great?
That was really fun.
I know that people can have useful careers in many areas.
Medicine, government, law, finance.
Education.
Yes, even education.
But I'd like to do something especially significant in my lifetime.
That could change the course of human history.
Such as starting a new dance craze.
Really?
Yes.
Something that could improve the lives of every person and every couple.
# That seems to be true Another night ##
I'm so proud of what you accomplished last night.
You showed those guys a really good time.
Without anything really bad happening.
That's good.
The guys you know, are they all Greeks?
What?
Are all the guys you know Greeks?
Excuse me.
I don't understand.
Are all the guys you know Greeks?
I don't think we know any Greeks.
Greeks, like frat boys.
Oh, yes.
Fraternities.
You mean members of the Greek-letter fraternities.
Yeah.
Like last night.
Actually, last night we were at the DU house.
DU.
Roman letters.
Not Greek.
Seven Oaks has never had a Greek-letter fraternity system.
It's always been a Roman-letter system here.
It's very different.
What house is this?
Oh, this isn't a fraternity.
At least not one anyone should want to join.
You probably think we're frivolous, empty-headed college coeds.
You're probably right.
I often feel empty-headed.
We're trying to make a difference in people's lives.
One way to do that is to stop them from killing themselves.
Have you ever heard of "Prevention is nine-tenths the cure"?
Well, in the case of suicide, it's actually 10-tenths the cure.
Those are clichés, aren't they?
Yes, they are.
It's interesting you say that.
I love clichés and hackneyed expressions.
Do you know why?
No.
Because they're largely true.
The hundreds, perhaps thousands, of such clichés and hackneyed expressions that our language has bequeathed us are a stunning treasure trove of human insight and knowledge.
Really?
Yes.
Oh, please sit down.
During these formative college years, we should learn as many clichéd and hackneyed thoughts as possible.
Furthermore, I think we will.
Speaking of suicide prevention, do you have a boyfriend, Lily?
Are you dating anyone?
I don't see the connection.
You don't?
Boyfriends are a primary suicide risk.
You don't have any particular friend?
No one at all?
No.
Well, there's this grad student I met over summer.
Xavier.
We became pretty good pals.
He has a girlfriend whom I've met.
She's very nice.
"Zavier. " With a Z?
No, I think it's with an X. No, I'm certain it's Z.
Zavier, like Zorro.
It's the same sound.
Zorro marked his name with a Z.
It's an X.
But Zorro's with a Z.
Okay, let me see if I can figure this out.
Used at the beginning of a name, Z and X have the same pronunciation.
But it's Zorro with a Z. Actually, there were two Zorros.
One spelled his name with a Z and made a Z mark for Zorro.
And there's Xorro who spelled his name with an X, and with his sword he'd make an X mark.
What was really unfair was because he marked his name with X, everybody assumed he was illiterate when he was spelling correctly.
Hello.
Can we help you?
Of course we can.
No case is too challenging.
Would you like a doughnut?
Okay.
Please, sit down.
Here, have some coffee.
Thank you.
What's your name?
Jim Bose.
But my friends call me Jimbo.
Why?
What?
Why do your friends call you Jimbo?
Well, it's a contraction of Jim and the first part of my last name, Bose.
Yeah, I got that.
But why bother?
What do you mean?
Jim is already a lovely name.
It's short, simple, evocative.
Shouldrt a nickname simplify the name that it replaces?
Jimbo doesn't really simplify anything.
I don't know.
Well, maybe you should ask your friends.
Where do you live or reside?
Doar Dorm.
Ugh.
Oh, my God.
Yuck.
What?
The smell, it's notorious.
What smell?
You're right, it's more like a stink.
Unclean clothing, I'd say, mostly.
Vomit.
Stale beer.
Pot.
Cheap deodorant.
There might be a vermin infestation.
Did you know a good-smelling environment is crucial to our sense of well-being?
Have you tried to find a better-smelling place?
Wait, wait.
It's not me, I'm not depressed.
You're not?
No.
Are you sure?
You kind of seem on edge.
No, I'm fine.
That's a terrible expression. "Fine. "
"I'm fine. " Something smug about it. "I'm fine. "
Why do you say that you're fine?
I'm not depressed.
I'm not suicidal.
Why are you here, then?
Are you a con man?
A confidence trickster?
No, there's a girl.
Her boyfriend dumped her.
She was crying but now is silent.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you say so?
We have to go.
Call the cops!
A suicide might be in progress!
The campus cops?
Yes, of course the campus cops.
Take this.
We have a lot of students coming to the centre pretending to be depressed to get doughnuts.
Confidence tricksters.
Yes, it's really bad.
Really cynical.
We pledged to the doughnut company, we would only give doughnuts to students who were depressed or otherwise nutty.
We're a nonprofit, so the rules are pretty strict.
This man could still be a trickster.
Well, we'll soon find out.
Tell me about this girl.
Well, ahem, her name is Priss.
She's very pretty.
Oh, yes.
It's very hard for beautiful women to experience rejection.
Priss?
Priss.
Are you okay?
Priss!
Priss, say something!
Priss!
Open up!
Oh, thank God.
We're gonna have to force this door.
Priss?
Are you okay?
What?
Please don't.
Please, come with us.
Do you wanna talk about it?
What was his name?
Josh.
If you'd rather not talk, we don't have to.
No, it's okay, I just...
I keep thinking how he used to gaze at me with such love in his eyes.
You know what I mean?
No.
No, I've never actually seen that.
Yes.
Just days ago, he'd gaze at me.
His eyes, so blue.
He had blue eyes?
So does Frank.
Frank's the guy that I go out with.
Otherwise, he's not conventionally good-looking, which I actually prefer.
Would you describe Josh as handsome?
That's a problem.
Could I join you guys?
Yes, please.
Priss and I were just talking.
In my view, handsome men are to be avoided.
I don't even consider good looks to be flattering in a man.
Do you know what I mean?
No.
Cookie-cutter, good-looking guys, with their chiselled features, running around, full of themselves, getting everything they want, never suffering or experiencing...
We suffered?
We're not under discussion.
That's irrelevant.
That's besides the point.
Is this making you feel any better?
Yes.
I think so.
Good.
I hoped it would.
Okay, it's nearly 4 and The Daily Complainer's orientation meeting is about to start and I think we should go.
The editor, Rick DeWolfe, he's terrible.
A real jerk.
Why do you think he's such a jerk?
He's one of those that I was talking about.
Tall.
Probably considers himself very smart and handsome.
A journalist, so you can imagine the mindboggling arrogance and conceit.
But, Violet, don't you think...?
What?
Well, don't you think that the way you talk could be considered arrogant too?
I mean, a little?
Yes, of course.
But what's your point?
Wouldrt that be hypocritical, criticising Rick for something you could be criticised for yourself?
No.
I don't see why.
We're all flawed.
Must that render us mute to the flaws of others?
Must we tether ourselves from comment because our natures are human too?
We've got a rebel amongst us.
That's good, I think.
It's good to be challenged and criticised.
I know your intentions are good, it's just...
That's it precisely.
Our intentions are good.
We're seeking to help people rescue their lives from terrible sadness and failure, which is a won'thy goal, don't you think?
Yes.
But not exactly a humble one.
No.
I agree with you there.
You're right, absolutely.
I'd like to thank you for this chastisement.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to chastise.
No, I think you did, and I think it's good.
It's good to have a friend to put one in one's place when that's what one needs.
Now I see that I have that kind of friend in you.
I think that's great.
Hello, people.
Listen up.
People, quiet.
Quiet, people.
Shut up!
Ha-ha-ha.
Okay, that's better.
I'm Rick DeWolfe, editor of The Complainer.
Over the next weeks, I'm the person you're gonna hate most in the world.
You're gonna hate me because I'm gonna work you, point out your stupidity and incompetence, and do everything in my power to turn you into journalists.
Albeit barely literate ones.
Oh, brother.
Any questions?
No?
Yes.
How did The Daily Complainer get its name?
Hmm.
Isn't that pretty obvious?
Heh-heh.
Um, it comes out every day and it's the university daily.
So The Daily Complainer.
The Daily...
No, I meant...
Oh, you mean, why The Complainer?
The name dates from Seven Oaks' earliest days as a divinity school.
The reference is to the Book of Job.
Job's complaint with the world.
Before justice can be achieved, a complaint must be made.
That is what we do and people don't like it a bit.
Right now, what that means is extirpating Seven Oaks' elitist Roman Letter Clubs that are like a cancer on the community.
They're not elitist in the least.
Yes, they are.
Have you met any of their members?
The guys from the DU, for example?
They're barely competent for the tasks of everyday life.
They have to drink a quart of beer just to talk to a woman?
Two quarts.
Yet you salivate at the idea of taking the roof off their heads and throwing them on the street where who knows what would happen.
You call yourself a Christian.
No, I don't.
What unkindness and cruelty.
This is the darkness in the heart of man, which Joseph Conrad wrote about most eloquently.
Ooh.
He was actually Polish.
Oh, my God.
Unkind, self-righteous and pedantic.
In short, a model journalist.
You should know something about these girls.
They run the suicide centre where their preferred therapy for depressed and suicidal people is tap dancing.
I kid you not.
Tap is a highly effective therapy, as well as a dazzlingly expressive dance form that has been sadly neglected for too many years.
It's moronic and barbaric.
You expect tap dancing to solve people's problems?
No, we don't.
We're using the whole range of musical dance numbers which have proven themselves to be effective therapies for the suicidal and the hopelessly depressed.
That really got me down.
I thought you handled it well.
You did?
Thanks.
No, it's all this aggression and hostility that gets me down.
Not just his but also my own.
It leaves you feeling unclean.
Have you thought of taking a shower?
Maybe you'd feel better.
You're probably right.
No, there's something else.
What Lily was saying about me being conceited and arrogant.
I'm sorry.
No, I think you're right.
I'm really ashamed.
You're joking.
No, it's terrible how I've acted.
We're all Christians.
Or I should say Judeo-Christians.
Humility should be our watchword.
The essence of being a good person.
Humility comes from within.
If it's not there in the first place, where do you go to get it?
I stopped looking a long time ago.
Very good, Freak.
You really think so?
Yes.
Certainly.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Violet.
Is it such a good idea to call him Freak?
What?
He's already depressed and you're calling him Freak.
That's his name.
Freak.
Freak Astaire.
That's how he wants to be called.
What are you talking about?
Lily was just saying she likes your dancing.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Are you okay?
What do you mean?
I thought you looked sad and was wondering if there was anything we could do.
What could you do?
Oh, I know.
You think I'm gonna kill myself and make you look bad.
No, I'm worried that you'll kill yourself and make yourself look bad.
Do you have any idea how demoralising it is to be constantly questioned about whether you're suicidal or not?
No.
After a while, you wonder, why is everyone asking me this?
They want me to be suicidal?
Or is it just the consequence of your utter absurdity?
Excuse me.
What scent are you wearing?
What are you talking about?
The perfume you're wearing.
I'm not wearing any perfume!
You see, that could be the problem.
I've become friends with a group.
Really?
Although they're perfume-obsessed.
Oh, them?
Those girls?
The ones who volunteer at the centre?
Yeah.
But they're terrible.
The blond one?
She's notorious.
What do you mean?
Such a bitch.
Terrible, isn't she?
Would balsamic be okay?
What?
Balsamic vinegar.
For the dressing.
Oh.
Yeah, sure.
What's that?
What?
Those.
Artichokes?
Is that what they look like?
Come on, Lily.
You've seen an artichoke before.
You haven't?
They look so weird.
I'm not convinced that having a suicide-prevention centre prevents any suicides.
Well, the coffee's good.
If someone were determined to destroy themselves,
I don't think they'd stop for coffee.
It depends on what it tastes like.
Where are we going?
I thought I'd take Priss over to DU.
Why?
It might be helpful for her to meet some of the guys.
How would that be helpful?
They're morons.
Oh, come on, Lily.
No, they're morons.
No.
Not medically.
I like them.
They're in that sympathetic range of being not good-looking and yet not smart.
There's something likeable about that.
Spending time with them, you get the sense that you're making a difference.
For somebody suicidal, like Priss, that could be a real boost.
I'm not suicidal.
Oh, that's good.
It's better not to have an identity as a suicidal person, don't you think?
Well, uh, bye.
Well...
Where are you going?
Over to Xavier's.
Is that a good idea?
Why wouldn't it be?
Is his girlfriend gonna be there?
Of course.
Gosh, you're nosy.
No, no, it's just a general foreboding.
"Foreboding"?
You know, you're absolutely right.
I was being nosy.
Terribly so.
I've gotta watch that.
Yes, we must improve ourselves.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Lily.
You were coming over?
Hey.
Yeah.
Is Alice home?
Alice is working.
Oh, she is?
But it's not a problem.
It's good you came.
Let's go to the Oak Bar.
I'll buy you a beer.
I thought Alice would be back.
I'll call her.
She'll join us there.
Come on.
Okay.
She's actually quite a good person.
Her entire identity revolves around helping people.
You really think that's true?
What's she have against The Complainer?
That's bizarre.
Well, she thinks the editor, Rick DeWolfe, is completely egotistical.
And your friend isn't?
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, Lily.
Hi.
Great.
You got the message.
Yeah.
Who's egotistical?
Lily's roommate.
She sounds unbearable.
She's on a rampage against The Complainer.
Really?
Why?
She thinks the editor, Rick DeWolfe, is conceited.
And, in fact, quite mean.
Mean?
Yes.
He wants to close the Seven Oaks Roman Letter Clubs.
That's good, isn't it?
Everyone was against them.
No.
Come on.
There's no justification for those places.
They're exclusive and elitist.
The point that Violet makes is that they can't be elitist.
They're morons.
Yeah, elitist morons.
You'll grant they're morons.
That's a handicap.
Such people should be helped, not hounded and persecuted.
Persecuted?
Yes, losing the roof over your head?
That's the worst thing that can happen.
Violet thinks there could be some risk of suicide.
Because some boy might kill himself, Seven Oaks can't do what's right?
It's a factor to be considered.
Yeah.
No, it isn't.
You can't set policy that way.
Excuse me, we didn't order these.
Compliments of the guy at the bar.
That's a playboy or operator move.
Operators like that are to be avoided.
Why?
It seems generous, sending drinks to people you don't know.
Drinks are expensive.
Drinks to two gorgeous girls.
His intention was to seduce and he assumed he could.
Both?
That seems a bit harsh.
You don't know what he was thinking.
Was he alone?
Yes.
You see?
He was alone and probably lonely.
He could see that Alice and Lily were students.
Students are known for their intelligent conversation.
They can always talk about their courses.
That was probably what attracted him.
Nonsense.
Perhaps his view was even loftier.
To court Lily with a view to matrimony.
We're in the north, but a southern gentleman can wander into these parts.
Rubbish.
Seeing Lily across a crowded bar filled with the usual undergraduate slobs.
Why wouldn't a thoughtful young man seek her out?
She's lovely.
Isn't it incumbent on men and women to find ways to meet each other?
Buying drinks for a person you don't know seems to be a generous one.
Yes.
Most guys won't even pay for the women they do know.
What you've described is a playboy or operator move.
I'll grant you that it's a tactic or perhaps even a ruse, but without some of that, would our species even survive?
The Lord said, "Be fruitful and multiply. "
Oh, my gosh.
No, this is how the world works, seeing someone across a room.
This could be the romantic story you tell your grandchildren.
And if you do marry and have children, then he'll really learn how to squander cash.
Isn't it good to know that he's basically generous from the start?
Where's Priss?
Your eyes are so striking.
So blue.
Really?
They're blue?
Yes.
The most piercing blue.
You must know your eyes are blue.
No.
What do you mean?
What?
Heh.
You must know what colour your eyes are.
Your eyes are very blue.
You know that.
I'm not gonna go around checking what colour my eyes are.
When you look in the mirror, you see that your eyes are blue.
Oh, come on.
What?
I don't think my eyes have a colour.
If my eyes are so blue looking out, wouldn't everything be kind of blue?
Like, have a bluish tinge to it?
Doesrt.
Just looks normal.
That's...?
That's blue?
That colour?
Yes, of course.
Then what colour is that?
Green.
You're saying that chair's green but Frank's eyes are blue?
Yes.
Then what colour are the walls?
Also green.
Huh.
You didn't know that?
No.
How's that possible?
You think knowing the colours is so important?
You're in college and you don't know the colours?
Doesrt that embarrass you?
Well, no.
Why should it?
That's why the 'rents are paying big bucks to send me here.
You know, to learn stuff.
Well, gotta go hit the books.
I don't think anyone should feel embarrassed about not knowing stuff.
What's embarrassing is pretending to know.
Or putting people down because you think they don't know as much.
Look, I'm happy to admit I'm completely ignorant.
That's why I'm here and plan to really hit the books.
So the next time you see me, I will know more than I do now.
I'll be older but also wiser.
Or at least know more stuff.
For me, that's education.
Cheers.
Thor's great.
He's very clear about his objectives.
He really wants to learn things.
Frank?
What a jerk.
He's a monster.
Oh, my gosh, Violet.
You did everything for them.
They're nothing without you.
What a rat.
He's a moron.
Don't waste a tear on that creep.
Don't waste a single breath.
Jerk.
Stop.
Please.
What?
I love Frank.
I love him.
Come on, Violet, Frank's a moron.
You are well rid of him.
Don't say that.
Frank's not a moron?
You know, Lily, you're a bit harsh.
This obsession with intelligence.
Do you think it has some magical quality transforming everything?
The intelligence line is not an immutable barrier.
Love can cross it.
You can love someone whose mental capacity is not large.
I know.
I have.
Well, there's a mutable barrier, then.
Frank's stupid, we knew.
That he's a rat playboy operator, I hadrt realised.
I don't want to turn bitter.
I worry for Frank.
I care about him.
Well, I'd stop.
No.
I love Frank.
I always will.
If that's the case, why not fight for him?
Against Priss?
I'd never win.
Sure you would.
Priss is a rat.
A bitch.
A rat bitch.
Don't blame Priss.
She was crushed when her blue-eyed Josh left her.
I should've known.
Of course she'd fall for Frank.
Josh and Frank are both blue-eyed heartbreakers.
Poor Violet.
She's the roommate who's so self-confident?
Yeah.
But now she's a wreck.
But there's no logic to the algebra of love.
"The algebra of love. " Mm-hm.
That sounds like the title to some lame book.
It's a title, but the book's not lame at all.
Love's algebra?
I thought it was more geometry.
Okay, the title's not good, but the book is.
What's it say?
Well, that while we're all perverse in our romantic preferences, there's actually this logic or algebra to our perversity, and it has something to do with how the species has evolved.
The survival of the species?
Yes.
And whether it will continue to do so.
No booze?
Just to find the nearest package store, you had to drive 40 miles.
These aren't so strong.
No, they're really strong.
I think I'd like another.
That wouldn't be a good idea.
Why not?
Well...
Are you trying to stifle me?
Lily?
Oh, hi.
Listen, we're gonna get something to eat.
Why don't you come with us?
I'm with Charlie.
I can see that.
But you really should come.
Why?
I just think it would be a good idea.
But why?
You really must come.
I insist.
Lily?
Lily?
Lily, are you angry?
Lily, this is it.
We're here.
What's the matter?
That was so rude.
He's a nice guy and you embarrassed him.
He's not nice.
He was trying to get you drunk.
No, he wasrt.
Plying you with martinis?
I was plying myself with martinis.
Come on, the guy's a total sleaze.
A creep.
You don't know anything about him.
The way he sent drinks over to our table?
Alice.
Alice, what's wrong?
I had no idea that Xavier could be so mean.
Sounds as if he was just trying to protect you.
This Charlie Walker sounds like an operator or playboy type.
No, he's not like that.
He's actually a really nice guy.
I thought he was a slick businessman.
No.
He dresses well, but he works in strategic development.
What?
Strategic development.
He works at SDA.
Strategic Development Associates.
He's an associate there.
What he is, is a strategic operator.
Violet, are you okay?
Hey, miss, rairs coming!
Better get back!
Polly, have you seen Violet?
No.
Is something wrong?
We're not sure.
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
Oh, my gosh, what happened?
I don't understand.
What were you doing?
How long were you gone for?
I'm sorry, I don't know.
I lost track of time.
But you feel better now?
Well, cleaner.
She'll say anything to get in the show.
She'll want doughnuts.
You don't have to be suicidal to get doughnuts, just depressed.
Clinically depressed.
From a clinic.
Would you say you're depressed?
I don't like the term.
I prefer to say I'm in a tailspin.
Oh, my God.
A tailspin?
She can't even say she's depressed.
She's gotta say something special.
Priss was honest.
She was depressed and she had a right to be in the show.
Now every silly tailspinner's trying to get in.
The show is for everyone.
No, it isn't, Freak.
To be in the centre's programmes, you have to be clinically depressed.
That means that you've been to a clinic, and they've said that you're depressed.
Have you been to a clinic?
Have you been to a clinic?
Then you're not clinically depressed.
Violet.
Violet.
What is it?
Where are you going?
All I wanted was to make Frank happy.
I had all these plans.
Things we could've done together.
I never even got to tell him.
Hey!
Where all your boyfriends at?
Come on!
They don't wear bikinis.
They're ladies, they wear thongs.
I can't imagine where she could've gone.
Wherever she went, she should be back by now.
How did she seem when you last saw her?
Really sad about Frank.
Still?
Yeah.
How can someone so smart continue mooning over a dope like that?
People aren't exactly as you assume.
The Violet you know bears little resemblance to the girl I met in seventh grade.
You met Violet in seventh grade?
Well, her name wasrt Violet then.
What's your name?
You can tell us your name.
We won't bite.
What's your name?
Tell us.
Are you retarded?
Tell us your name.
Emily Tweeter.
Tweeter?
Like a bird?
That's ridiculous.
Tweeter?
Like a bird?
Not an easy name to have at that age.
Not at any age.
What was she like?
Timid.
Bookish.
Classic scholarship student.
Her parents were writers.
They didn't have a dime.
Finances were the least of her worries.
What do you mean?
Well, she was crazy.
I got stuck rooming with her on a trip when no one else would.
It was awful.
Did she smell bad?
No.
Obsessive cleanliness was part of her insanity.
You were nice to her.
No.
The idea of being nice to weird kids hadrt arrived.
Why was she so unpopular?
Well, she was very strange.
Constantly setting herself odd, repetitive tasks.
Tasks?
For example, on that trip she had with her a little square suitcase.
The idea came into her head she had to move it in a precise pattern over and over again, and if she didn't execute this movement flawlessly 10 times, she'd start over.
Another was to slide her hand across her forehead, trying not to touch her hair or eyebrows on either side, also repeating it 10 times.
Any niggling thought she'd touched the hair, she'd start over.
My God, that is insane.
Why would she do that?
She had the conviction that if she didn't complete these tasks, her parents would die.
Was she Catholic?
No.
But what made the whole thing really sad was that her parents did die.
Oh, my God.
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
Violet?
Violet!
Violet, where are you?
Something's wrong, isn't it, dear?
You mind my asking?
Well, I do mind a little.
Excuse me, Your Highness.
I'm sorry.
It's just kind of awkward to talk about.
No matter.
I hope you haven't come to get run over on the highway.
What do you mean?
Suicides.
They come down from the university.
Jump out in the road.
Get hit by the blind curve.
Hope you're not one of them.
Do I look like one of them?
I don't know.
Maybe.
Messy people, suicides.
Think only of themselves and their own deaths.
Not what comes after.
They leave quite a mess.
Mm-hm.
They don't stick around to clean it up.
Mm-mm.
So you're not one of those depressed students from the university?
I don't like the word "depressed. " I prefer to say that I'm in a tailspin.
A tailspin?
Does this tailspin involve a man?
Yes, it does.
But I'm not as crazy as I was up till yesterday.
Apparently that's due to the salutary effect of scent on the human psyche.
Its importance is, I believe, almost incalculable.
At the motel, I happened to use this soap.
It was provided to me as a courtesy as one of the guests.
That an economical motel would provide such good soap is quite unusual.
The scent is very precise.
Really?
Tell me if it provokes any particular reaction in your psyche.
A state of mind.
Hmm.
I always knew she was unstable.
They're gonna have her photo at the registrar's.
Violet!
Violet!
You're back!
You're okay!
Not really.
Oh, my gosh, Violet, we were so worried.
Why didn't you tell us or leave a note?
I did leave a note.
Would that be a suicide note?
I wouldn't leave without a note.
Where did you go?
I took the train to Villafranca and checked into a motel there.
The Motel 6?
No, the Motel 4.
It's even less expensive.
The Motel 4 in Villafranca?
My God, you really were suicidal.
Why'd you go?
I had to do something.
And you really thought you were gonna find the answer in Villafranca?
I'm not sure what I expected, but I might have found it.
What?
Soap?
This scent and this soap is what gives me hope.
Hello?
Hello?
Is anyone here?
Hello?
Lily?
Hello?
Oh, my gosh.
I couldn't understand where everyone was.
Sorry, I just went out to get some things.
Where's Alice?
Gone.
What do you mean?
Left.
We broke up.
But when you called, you said...
I know, I'm sorry.
I thought it better to tell you in person.
Alice couldn't control her jealousy.
It completely overwhelmed her.
Really?
What was she jealous of?
Come on.
No, what?
You.
After a while, I just couldn't handle it.
Things became impossible.
She was jealous of me?
Of course.
Would it be okay if we watch a film?
Yes.
Um...
What would you like to see?
I thought maybe Truffaut's Baisers v olés.
Stolen Kisses.
Do you know it?
No, is it new?
It's a classic of French New Wave cinema.
I think you'll like it.
But it's in colour?
Yeah.
You don't know Truffaut?
No.
Do you know Godard, À bout de souffle?
Why was Alice so jealous?
What do you think?
She was jealous because Lily's lovely.
I don't know.
They had a lot of problems.
Of course.
You wouldn't break up a happy couple.
What's that?
A note Frank left.
Really?
Recently?
No, when we were together.
Now that most correspondence is electronic, it's rare to be left anything written by hand.
Frank can write by hand?
What is it?
It's not very important.
It's just all I have.
What's it say?
"Out for brewskis.
Back in a giff. "
What's a "giff"?
One of those little motor scooters, isn't it?
I'm sure he meant to write "jiff" with a J. "Back in a jiff. "
But he wrote "giff. "
Could Frank be dyslexic?
No.
Dyslexics are intelligent.
What's that?
Frank's bean ball.
He gave you his bean ball?
Not exactly.
This is an extra.
He thought he'd leave it here just in case he lost his other one.
Gosh, Violet, you've really gotta stop thinking about Frank.
Why?
I don't wanna stop thinking about him.
Recently I had a thought that cheered me up a lot.
Life is like a long, flowing river, and as a long, flowing river, some debris you never expect to see again is almost certain to reappear floating to the surface.
Frank and I may very well be together again one day.
Maybe it'll take years, but somewhere down the line, he's very likely to pop up again, and I'll be there to catch him.
I don't think we've spoken about this.
What?
Have you been to the south of France?
To the walled city of Carcassonne?
I've never been anywhere.
But you've seen pictures of it.
No, I don't think so.
Oh, it's fascinating.
I'd like to visit.
You never studied the Cathars?
They were a religious movement, very idealistic, located mostly in the southwest of France that the Catholic Church repressed.
Oh, my God.
The Catholic Church is, like, always bad.
Ideas can't be killed as easily as people.
Especially such enlightened ones as the Cathars held.
In recent years, more and more people have returned to their beliefs.
So you're a Cathar?
Yes.
I aspire to be.
I'm trying to follow the path the Cathars marked out.
That's so impressive.
I can tell you we didn't have any Cathars back home.
I think you'd be surprised.
In the Cathar view, the highest form of lovemaking avoids procreation entirely.
Sure.
Condoms, right?
Well, according to Cathar ideas, sex with condoms is just a parody of the procreative act.
Mm.
What do you mean?
The standard, cliché form of sexual intercourse is for the man to approach a woman from the front.
Cathar lovemaking, I think you'll find very fulfilling.
I'll be very careful, we'll go slowly.
It'll be a new experience, but one which I think you'll find brings an inexpressible closeness.
Might your drinks-buying friend be around?
It would be great to get complimentary cocktails.
Charlie?
No.
Do you still see him at all?
He calls from time to time.
He does?
Why don't you introduce us?
Why should I introduce you?
Because you know him, and we don't.
So?
"So?"
"So" is probably the unkindest word in the English language.
I can't bear it.
I think it should be outlawed. "So. "
You're crazy.
Come on, Lily, you have Xavier.
You can't keep two guys for yourself.
Guys do that all the time.
We're not guys, fortunately.
It's unconscionable for you not to bring him and introduce us.
Charlie is a friend.
He's a nice guy.
What do you mean?
I hate to think what'd happen if you got your claws into him.
That's outrageous.
We're perfectly nice.
We've met lots of pathetic guys and nothing bad's happened.
Charlie's not pathetic.
Well, all the better, then.
The Roman Holidays will be coming soon.
What's that?
A festival Roman Letter Clubs put on.
A kind of moron jamboree.
The Roman elements are the worship of Bacchus, Beerus and Blotto.
It could've all been so uplifting.
Charlie.
Hey, Charlie.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Have you the day off?
Yeah.
This is my friend Charlie, whom I think I've mentioned.
And, Charlie, these are my roommates.
This is, um...
This is Rose.
And this is Heather.
And Violet.
Charlie works for Strategic Development Associates.
He's an associate there.
You work in strategic development?
You've heard of it?
Of course, yes.
My cousin Jay in Philadelphia works in strategic development.
Something business-related?
Mostly business, but any kind of organisation.
Only businesses pay the big bucks.
Nonprofits and government pay well.
That's how they keep from having profits, by paying lots of money to companies like yours.
Excuse me, but aren't you in Professor Ryars course at the Ed School?
No.
You're not in Professor Ryars Flit Lit course?
No.
Flit Lit?
The dandy tradition in literature.
I'm sure I've seen you there.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm not in any courses at the Ed School.
Good to meet you.
It was great to see you.
Bye.
God, Violet, what was that about?
That guy is definitely in Professor Ryars class.
Not possible.
He has a fulltime job for Strategic Development Associates.
He never got his coffee.
Why lie about something like that?
He's lying.
I find that very attractive.
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna stop cutting Professor Ryars class.
It can be argued that Firbank was too little disciplined, too unserious in his unseriousness to create works of enduring value.
But as a liberating influence on later writers such as Waugh, his importance should not be discounted.
It's not Firbank's work itself but the idea of his work that so helped later writers as Thomas Love Peacock did in the previous century.
I'm not gonna come anymore.
What a waste of time.
Charlie.
Charlie.
Charlie?
Charlie, you are taking the course.
Charlie?
Who's Charlie?
Fred, what's going on?
Fred?
Uh-oh.
Fred.
Sounds like you got some explaining to do.
Well, you were lying.
I wasrt lying, I was making it up.
Why were you making it up?
If you were an eighth-year Ed School student, would you advertise that?
Eighth year.
Impressive.
But your whole life was a lie.
Dressing up in suits.
Buying people drinks.
The suits were real.
The drinks, real.
Not just drinks for people.
They were for cute girls.
There's a perfectly rational, easily explainable agenda.
So it was a playboy or operator move.
Of course.
Transparently so.
I admire that.
Drinks are expensive.
But strategic development, that was made up too?
You said your cousin Jay was in it.
What cousin Jay?
In Philadelphia.
I don't have a cousin in Philadelphia.
You said your cousin Jay was working in strategic development.
I was just saying that to be friendly.
To make a kind of link.
So your name's Fred something?
Yes.
Fred something.
Packenstacker?
Oh, my God.
How crazy.
He's completely insane.
I almost dated him.
You can say that about a lot of guys.
I don't think he's crazy.
Making up an entirely fictitious identity, that's not crazy?
It's insane.
It's psycho.
Violet's identity is made up.
I don't think she's crazy.
No, I am.
No, this is different.
It's crazy and pathetic.
All that about strategic development he just made up.
Don't tell me that's not weird.
I've heard of strategic development.
I think it's something pretty important.
Violet, you're not gonna start going out with him.
You're not, are you?
Well, we had planned to go to the library.
Not to the stacks, I hope.
Yes.
Oh, my gosh, do you realise how dangerous that is?
Dangerous?
Yes, the stacks.
They're dark and deserted.
Anything could happen.
It's true.
With the study habits at Seven Oaks, your body won't be found until spring.
Promise you won't go with him to the stacks.
Please.
Okay.
I'll suggest the Randall Room.
Don't suggest.
Insist.
And please not at night.
Okay.
What are you reading?
Have you chosen a topic for your final paper?
The decline of decadence.
You think that decadence has declined?
Definitely.
Bigtime.
Major, major decline.
How?
How or in what ways?
Either.
Well, take the flit movement in literature, or homosexuality.
It's gone completely downill, right down the tubes.
Poof!
What do you mean?
Before, homosexuality was something refined, hidden, aspiring to the highest levels of creativity and often achieving it.
Now it seems to be musclebound morons running around in T-shirts.
It's pretty disillusioning.
Are you gay?
Not especially, but in another era, it might have had some appeal.
Now I just don't see the point.
You might be romanticising the past.
We'll never know.
The past is gone, so we might as well romanticise it.
Hmm.
You could be right.
I wanted to ask, how's Lily?
Lily.
She's okay.
Here, check it out.
A.L.A. Nope.
Hello.
Good afternoon.
Check it out.
The A.L.A. Heard of it?
We have a meeting on Tuesday.
You should come by.
What is the A.L.A.?
Oh.
Just join us.
Come Tuesday.
I think you'll really like it.
So...
A fellow was passing these out, and invited us to a meeting on Tuesday.
The A.L.A.?
Oh, my God.
I thought it was something related.
No?
The A.L.A. Has got nothing to do with us.
Can't you see that?
The way we express love has meaning.
It's in the context of something beautiful.
We're following our creator's teaching.
Aspiring to an ideal.
A beautiful one that brings an inexpressible closeness.
Not just to each other, but...
For the A.L.A., and those like them, the love act is just hedonistic pleasure-seeking of a perverted nature.
I can't believe you'd think we had anything in common with them.
We don't.
Nothing, not an iota.
My God, can't you see that?
Lily.
Lily, come back.
Please.
Don't be that way.

Oh, my gosh, Lily.
Are you okay?
It's all right.
You don't wanna talk about it?
I don't understand.
You don't understand what?
What is non-procreative lovemaking?
It could be a lot of things.
Yeah, but in this case?
We don't have to talk about this.
I don't mind.
Could somebody explain what this is about?
Well, if...
Cathars don't believe in procreative sex.
They don't have intercourse the usual way.
The usual way?
You don't have to talk about this.
No, it's okay.
It's the normal way, from the front where you can have procreation, not from the other side, where you can't.
The other side?
That's their religion?
No, but it's the direction their beliefs head in.
When they express love, that's what they do.
Wow.
How horrible.
You poor girl.
What?
That's terrible, what he obliged Lily to do.

What a bitch.
Priss?
Of course Priss.
"I'm so stressed.
Sad.
Depressed.
I'm so tired.
I'm fati-ged. "
She was so depressed, she had to get everything her own way.
"I'm so stressed.
Frantic. "
Man.
What a bitch.
Priss dumped you?
No.
It was mutual.
Oh, listen, I have a question.
You remember that bean ball that I left in your room?
Yeah.
Do you still have it?
Yeah.
Do you think I could get it back?
I lost the other one, and with everything that's happened,
I'd really like to have it.
Nothing like some bean ball after a breakup.
Yeah.
God, you're smart.
You always get it.

Violet, what's wrong?
I'm sorry.
Lily's lovely.
Now she's free.
Go.
I understand.
Latin!
Et cetera!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Ha-ha!
This is what comes from not teaching Latin in the schools.
Yeah, it's moronic and boorish, but it's also kind of fun, don't you think?
No.
What's that stench?
I suppose this is what happens when decadence rots society from within.
And from without.
Such a society is, I fear, destined to fail and be overrun.
Maybe that's good.
Finally.
It's about time those cesspools were drained.
What colour would you say that chair is?
That's a chair?
I have no idea.
Guys have preferences.
You're going to accept that?
You're not going to do anything?
There's nothing to be done.
Fred must know his own mind.
Oh, really?
I seriously doubt that.
Come on.
Lily's got that slender, delicately swelling beauty that no man can resist.
Okay, you're probably right.
Poor Lily.
Just think of all Xavier put her through.
He just used her body.
And not even the right side.
Have you noticed that good people tend to have large posteriors?
Not everyone, by any means.
I know it's not logical.
But it does seem to be true.
The genetic link between morality and large posteriors?
Yes, I think that's well known.
You and Violet have that build.
It's nice.
You're still very attractive, but also sensible and moralistic.
I don't.
I have narrow hips, but also no very strong principles.
Yes?
Oh, hi.
Hi, Frank.
Hey, Heather.
Wow.
So I guess you guys all heard.
University's closing all the Roman Letter Houses.
Sorry.
This year's Roman Holidays did seem like the end of civilisation, but when civilisation ends people are going to need a place to stay.
Man.
It's bad.
It's that bastard from The Complainer.
Someone from the administratiors been reading it.
Hard to believe.
Bastard.
Listen, we were wondering if you thought it would be okay if we stayed at the suicide centre.
Okay, sure.
That sounds like a good stopgap measure.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, um...
So there's one more thing.
Remember that bean ball we talked about?
Yes.
You think I could pick that up?
Just after everything that's happened, it...
I could really use it right now.
Yes.
What's that?
What?
The note.
Oh.
One gets so few things written by hand anymore, I guess I kept it.
"Out for brewskis, back in a giff. "
What's a giff?
It's the scooter.
Like a Vespa, right?
That's what I thought.
I was thinking about getting one.
You must've meant "jiff. " "Back in a jiff. "
And then misspelled it, or spelled it in a nonstandard way.
Oh...
Heh.
Yeah.
Not a good speller.
Mm.
Thanks.
You're great.
Priss was such a bitch.
Damn.
Ha-ha.
Damn.
Hey, Heather.
Bye.
Bye.
Ha-ha.
Bye.
Bye.
Wow.
Heather is really cute.
She, um, going out with anyone?
There might be something between her and Thor.
Thor?
Damn.
Heather and Thor?
Damn.
I'm worried about Thor.
It's hard for us to imagine how upsetting it is not knowing the colours.
It's impossible for me to imagine.
When Thor sees a rainbow, it's so much gibberish to him.
There was one this afternoon.
Oh, my gosh, he took it hard.
Recently, there was a parade in the city where the marchers carried rainbow-coloured flags and banners.
Thor was so upset.
He had no idea what it meant.
What kind of retard is he?
See, that's the conclusion people jump to.
Well, it is somewhat understandable.
Not if you knew the full story.
What's the full story?
You know how parents love bragging about how precocious their children are?
Thor's parents had become precocity addicts, constantly needing an ever-greater precocity fix.
He should've entered kindergarten.
They pushed him into first grade.
"Thor skipped a grade," they could tell.
What Thor's parents failed to consider is the work done in nursery school.
Key being the study of colours.
I suppose they just assumed that colours are knowledge people pick up.
Like, for example, not stepping on sidewalk cracks.
What's that?
I think Rose is sleeping.
Am I boring?
No, not at all.
When you have problems, it's great to hear someone else's idiotic ones.
Please go on.
Wow.
What?
What you said about depressed people being mean, you werert joking.
I'm sorry, you're right.
Please go on.
No.
I'm sorry.
You know how I am.
Please continue.
Thor decided he absolutely had to learn all the colours.
Both primary and mixed.
He's been hitting the books hard, and thought he'd mastered them.
Then, in town, he said, "That traffic light's blue. "
I had to say, "No, it's green. "
He was really upset.
Oh, hi, Lily.
Hi.
We were worried about you.
I can't bear this tension with Lily.
It's terrible to have the group divided this way.
Better not next to Robertson.
What?
Didrt you hear?
Ed students have been going up to the roof and throwing themselves off.
But it's only two storeys.
Yes, I know.
It's terrible.
Not high enough to kill, but high enough to maim.
And particularly dangerous for anyone below.
I've got to forget about Fred.
But you really liked him.
This whole thing of a person meeting someone else first, it's so arbitrary.
It's terrible and cruel.
I have to say, I was wrong about Fred.
I thought he was a playboy or operator type.
In fact, he's just another guy rendered helpless by the attentions of a pretty girl.
Cary!
No, don't!
I love you!
Why did you do that?
Oh, my God!
Cary, I love you!
Isn't the Ed School essentially a teacher's college?
Yeah.
If they can't even destroy themselves, how are they going to teach America's youth?
# It's just that my happiness Finally commences #

# But no more Will I be the mourner #

What do you think you're doing?
Sorry.
Did I disturb you?
Why are you wearing tap shoes?
You out of your mind?
I think that's pretty clear.
I'm so sick of that.
Oh, really?
I think it's cute.
Since you won't be treating us to one of your incompetent tap routines, why don't you take those things off?
No.
We'll do the routine.
Rose.
Madge wants to see the routine.
I don't want to see your routine.
I asked you to take those off.
We need a break.
Just briefly, please.
It's helpful to have an audience.
Rose, the music.
I'm gonna report you.
Suzanne.
For me, it'd be Madame Curie, Simone de Beauvoir, and Margaret Sanger.
Good.
Violet.
I would say
Richard Strauss, Roderick Charleston, and Chubbard Checker.
Richard Strauss?
The composer?
Yes, that was one of his posts.
I'm not familiar with the others.
Could you tell us who they are?
Yes.
Each one of these men started an international dance craze.
Richard Strauss, the waltz.
Roderick Charleston, the Charleston.
Chubbard Checker, known as Chubby, the dance we know as the twist.
Why do you consider a dance craze important?
Dance crazes enance and elevate the human experience, bringing together millions of people in a joyous celebration of our God-given faculties, and passing these modes of physical expression down through the generations.
Though not so much anymore.
I thought...
Well, I assumed that the Charleston was named after the city of Charleston.
No.
Though that misconception is quite widely held.
It was Roderick Charleston.
Usually, behind some great creative phenomenon, there's a person, not a town.
This is so exciting.
It's really great, isn't it?
Hey, could you guys help?
Sure.
What's up?
We need help packing soap, which we'll distribute to Doar Dorm residents.
Cool.
What would you say are effective means to fight depression?
Maybe some of your DU brothers have an idea?
Uh...
Beer?
No.
Beer's a downer.
Cocktails.
Hard liquor and spirits is what really gives you a lift.
It's interesting what you say.
My cousin Jay is a medical officer in Philadelphia.
He says that alcoholism, by which I mean chronic, excessive consumption of alcohol, is the primary self-administered treatment for depression.
Cool.
No.
It leaves you much worse off than before.
Oh, no, not me.
I just boot and then I feel fine.
By "boot" do you mean vomit?
Yes.
No.
None of the effective anti-suicide treatments involve vomiting.
Hygiene?
Exactly.
It's very important.
That's why we have such hope in the wonder bar.
Do you know its scent?
Wow.
Transformative, we think.
This is so exciting.
When should we go over there?
I don't think there's any rush.
I'd like to go soon.
Doar Dorm has the highest fatality rate, as well as the worst hygiene.
Highest suicide rate.
Fatality rate.
It's uncertain what percentage were intentional and how many were just due to unawareness of gravity's laws.
I can just see those guys getting the gold packages, opening them, and finding the good-smelling soap inside.
The cute packaging should prove irresistible.
And once clean, they'll start to see the world with new eyes.
The change could be dramatic.
Doar Dorm could soon become Dior Dorm.
I doubt that, to be perfectly, absolutely honest.
I love the idea.
Dior Dorm.
I adore optimism, even when it's completely absurd.
Perhaps especially then.
Great.
Ready?
Let's go.
Let's hurry.
Let's not get our hopes up too high, Heather.
No, you said yourself, the wonder bar is transformative.
Hey, Violet.
Hi.
Hi.
Where you going?
Doar Dorm.
Fred, hi.
Hey.
Good one.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
I guess it wasrt realistic to expect Doar Dorm to turn into Dior Dorm overnight.
They wouldn't even open them.
They said without the soap, the discs wouldn't fly properly.
Are you coming Friday?
Violet's launching her dance craze.
Oh, really?
That's great.
What's the dance?
The Sambola.
The devil's dance.
Oh, cool.
We'll go, right?
Yes, I'd like to.
But I have several papers to finish.
But I'd like to.
Great.
Thanks, Gus.
I don't see how we're going to start a dance craze if no guys show up.
Most guys aren't very good with the dance-craze thing.
Very good news.
I was just in my procrastination seminar and the two guys from Doar Dorm had showered.
It was clear they'd used soap.
Oh, my gosh, what a difference.
Seems they'd been throwing packages so energetically, a soap bar fell out.
The unfamiliar ivory-like object intrigued them and one thing led to another, and, well...
It was just as you said.
Isn't that great?
Oh, look, here's Jimbo.
Jimbo doesn't count.
Where is everybody?
Arert we gonna be late for Violet's dance craze?
You wanna go to that?
Yeah.
You're kidding.
No, I love dance crazes.
Gosh, you're strange.
But aren't we already late?
No, it's later on.
Like 10, I think.
I have to confess, I've started losing patience with Violet.
Depression calls for serious treatment.
Medication.
Psychopharmaceuticals.
Talk therapy.
Are those approaches effective?
Despite the medication and therapy,
Ed School students are still throwing themselves off Robertson Hall.
Violet's ideas might seem a little offbeat...
A little?
Oh, my God.
I don't know how much you know about Violet, but there's some pretty weird stuff.
You know, Violet.
Violet Wister.
It's not even her real name.
It isn't?
No, it's Emily Tweeter.
When she was 11, she went completely crazy and has had several relapses since.
So it's a little worrisome to have her counsel nearly suicidal individuals.
I can't believe it.
What?
Emily Tweeter.
In first grade, I had an enormous crush on a girl with that name.
And you remember that?
Yeah.
Pretty huge Dr. Zhivago stuff.
Any idea or even mention of her filled me with emotion.
I had a strange perspective on the world.
I don't think my brain was functioning properly.
Everything was a bit of a dream.
You think this was Violet?
You have any idea if Violet attended Willamette Montessori?
In Portland?
We didn't order these.
Compliments of the guy at the bar.
It was so brutal how it ended between us.
I know I was too angry and a bit crazy, but I thought that what we had was stronger than that.
That you would not just walk away after one disagreement.
It wasrt just that.
Oh.
You mean my Cathar beliefs.
Well, ahem,
I am no longer a Cathar.
How is that possible?
It's been very difficult.
You've dropped your adherence to the Cathar faith?
Yes, I have.
Good.
Heh-heh.
Normally I'd be reluctant to comment on anyone's religion, but...
What?
I'm sorry.
I guess...
I guess I'm a bit of a bigot.
I just...
I could never take seriously any religion that worships on Tuesdays.
Major religions require worship on the weekend.
Friday, Saturday or Sunday.
I find it just really laudatory that people sacrifice their weekend time to worship God.
Having the Sabbath on Tuesday always seemed very bizarre to me.
It's not right.
You know what?
We'd better get to the Lone Star.
Why are you so concerned about that?
Well, it's not as if international dance crazes start every day.
We'd better hurry.
What's wrong?
Another fiasco.
Sometimes our struggle reminds me of the myth of Sisyphus.
Who?
The myth about the guy who pushes an enormous rock only to have it keep rolling back.
Oh, yeah.
What a knucklehead.
The important thing to remember is that he was mythical.
He never really existed.
Violet?
Did you spend any part of your education at Willamette Montessori?
In Oregon?
Why?
Sound like "tweaker. "
Would you say today is very grey?
I'd say so.
Maybe blue-grey.
Yeah, no, that rings a bell now.
Bye.
I'm sorry.
Her name wasrt Emily Tweeter, but Lucy Wurlitzer.
They're not similar.
I'm beginning to realise that the human memory is not the foolproof instrument we sometimes imagine.
What's worse, everyone knew about my obsession, including my parents, those from whom I most wanted it kept.
So from your earliest years, you were already a playboy or operator type?
Yes.
I suppose that's why secrecy seemed so desirable.
Violet, can we talk?
What's the plural of doofus?
Doufi.
Not doofuses?
You can say either.
"Doufi" respects the Latin root and is preferred.
"Doofuses" is also correct, although a bit inelegant.
You've thought a lot about this.
Yes, I've had to.
Mm.
Why?
What is it?
I like Fred, he's a nice guy.
And I can see why you like him.
When I first met you and Rose, I thought you were the cool crowd.
And in many ways you are.
I find your perfume and fashion sense excellent.
Thank you.
But there's a reason, I think, why you are so strongly attracted to... doufi.
And it's not an accident how different groups divide up.
Isn't that a rainbow?
That's a rainbow!
Thor.
No, Thor!
Thor, no!
Stop!
Please, stop!
He's headed for Robertson Hall!
Red.
Orange.
Yellow.
Green.
Blue.
Indigo.
Hallelujah!
Lord God, thank you.
Education.
Education.
We can learn the subjects we set out to master, no matter how hard or impossible they may seem.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I wasrt sure I was gonna make it.
Magenta.
Pink.
Gold.
I miss my nice American friend.
No, you're mistaken.
You go to London for four weeks?
Six.
It's dangerous, parents letting children travel.
They send them off and they don't know what they'll be getting back.
I don't know what you're referring to.
You're not from London.
I'm from London.
I was there, now I'm here.
I'm from London.
I just miss my nice American friend.
Nice?
Nice?
Fine.
I'm fine.
Those are not adjectives I like to use.
God gave us abilities.
He requires that we use them.
Good, better, best, excelsior, higher.
Only excellence can glorify the Lord.
Vulgarity is, in essence, blasphemous.
I'm sorry for what I was saying before.
Of course you're not linked to the doufi, or even that such distinctions are valid.
No, don't apologise.
I probably do have a doufi orientation.
But behind coolness, isn't there a certain repressing, squashing down, or lack of cultivation of one's humanity?
Oh, so you think that cool people have less humanity?
No, I don't think cool people are entirely inuman.
Just enough to be cool.
In our society, there's all this propaganda, in favour of uniqueness, eccentricity, et cetera.
But does the world really want or need more of such traits?
Arert such people usually terrible pains in the neck?
What the world needs to work properly is a large mass of normal people.
I would like to be one of those.
Sorry.
But you'll still do the part?
Yeah, of course.
So do you know every number in every Fred Astaire movie?
There were two in our school musical.
I know those.
Did performing those two numbers help you overcome feelings of discouragement and despair?
Absolutely.
Freak.
# If I should suddenly start to sing #

Look.
Where?
There.
Yes.
I think so.
Hello.
Are you a new student?
Yes.
Good.
We thought so.
We'd like to help you.
Help me?
Uh...
What do you mean?
As a freshman, it can be very tough.
You get to college and it's supposed to be great, but it's not.
University life can be pretty bad.
There are a lot of suicides.
Well, attempted ones.
I'm not actually a freshman.
I'm a transfer student.
Oh, an entering sophomore?
Yes.
You were unappy and are looking to recover here.
Well, I think you will.
Yes.
Would you welcome that?
Would our help be something you'd appreciate?
Or would you rather sink or swim on your own?
Either way is fine.
We'll be friends.
Yes, whichever you'd prefer.
Yes.
Sure.
Great.
Heh.
We should start immediately.
Clothes can be crucial for confidence and an overall sense of well-being.
Clothes don't have to be expensive.
You need friends of the same size.
You don't like my clothes?
I'm just saying.
Move it out.
What?
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
You didn't notice that?
No.
What?
Those guys.
That smell.
That awful, acrid odour.
Have you heard of nasal shock syndrome?
Any harsh, acrid or just disgusting odour sends Rose into nasal shock.
Just from some BO?
"Just some BO"?
Oh, my God, Lily.
You must have a very high threshold for pain.
That'll serve you well at Seven Oaks.
What do you mean?
Seven Oaks is notorious for its BO.
It was the last of the Select Seven to go coed.
An atmosphere of male barbarism predominates, but we're going to change that.
Yes.
Where are you going?
Gotta get to the Housing Department.
They lost my rooming assignment.
That's terrible.
You have no place to stay?
Was it just mislaid?
No, there were more acceptances than they anticipated, and not enough rooms to go around, so...
Why don't you stay with us?
Really?
Don't think of this in the old-fashioned sense of going to a party to find someone or not find someone.
That's not the dynamic that we're talking about.
What dynamic are you talking about?
Glad you asked.
Our going to a party of this kind is more a form of youth outreach.
Of what?
Youth outreach.
It's not just some moronic frat-house social function.
Though it will be that too.
We've gotta keep in mind that these guys are young people.
They're essentially immature and crying out for help and guidance.
Though they don't know it.
No, they don't, but we do.
Arert they the same age as we are?
Only numerically.
I'm a lot fatter than you are, but I think we could pin it.
Oh, my gosh, that's beautiful.
Ooh la la.
Stunning.
Take Frank, my friend.
He's not some cool, handsome, studly macho type.
No, not at all.
I can't stand guys like that.
He's more of a sad sack really, wouldn't you say?
Definitely.
What is a sad sack?
A loser.
You like losers?
Very much so.
Do you know what's the major problem in social life?
What?
The tendency, widespread, to always seek someone cooler than yourself.
It's always a stretch.
Often a big stretch.
Why not find someone who's inferior?
Someone like Frank.
Yes.
It's more rewarding.
And, in fact, quite reassuring.
You mean someone you can help, not just thinking of yourself.
Yes, that's it, precisely.
But without the goody-goody implications.
Our aspirations are pretty basic.
Take a guy who hasn't realised his full potential or doesn't even have much, and then help him realise it or find more.
There's enough material here for a lifetime of social work.
What's really worrisome is that that was intentional.
Frank.
Mm.
Frank, this is Lily.
She's just come to Seven Oaks as a transfer student.
Isn't she great?
Lily failed or wasn't happy at her last school.
We're sure that she's going to adapt here.
In fact, she already has.
Oh, good.
# Another night Another dream #
Oh, my God.
A golden oldie.
I love these.
# Another night Another dream but always you #
# In the night I dream of love So true #
# Just another night Another vision of love #
# You feel joy, you feel pain 'Cause nothing will be the same #
# Just another night Is all that it tak es #
# To understand the difference Between lovers and fak es #
# So baby, I talk, talk I talk to you #
# In the night in your dream Of love so true #
# I talk, talk I talk to you #
Oh, my gosh.
Wasn't that great?
That was really fun.
I know that people can have useful careers in many areas.
Medicine, government, law, finance.
Education.
Yes, even education.
But I'd like to do something especially significant in my lifetime.
That could change the course of human history.
Such as starting a new dance craze.
Really?
Yes.
Something that could improve the lives of every person and every couple.
# That seems to be true Another night ##
I'm so proud of what you accomplished last night.
You showed those guys a really good time.
Without anything really bad happening.
That's good.
The guys you know, are they all Greeks?
What?
Are all the guys you know Greeks?
Excuse me.
I don't understand.
Are all the guys you know Greeks?
I don't think we know any Greeks.
Greeks, like frat boys.
Oh, yes.
Fraternities.
You mean members of the Greek-letter fraternities.
Yeah.
Like last night.
Actually, last night we were at the DU house.
DU.
Roman letters.
Not Greek.
Seven Oaks has never had a Greek-letter fraternity system.
It's always been a Roman-letter system here.
It's very different.
What house is this?
Oh, this isn't a fraternity.
At least not one anyone should want to join.
You probably think we're frivolous, empty-headed college coeds.
You're probably right.
I often feel empty-headed.
We're trying to make a difference in people's lives.
One way to do that is to stop them from killing themselves.
Have you ever heard of "Prevention is nine-tenths the cure"?
Well, in the case of suicide, it's actually 10-tenths the cure.
Those are clichés, aren't they?
Yes, they are.
It's interesting you say that.
I love clichés and hackneyed expressions.
Do you know why?
No.
Because they're largely true.
The hundreds, perhaps thousands, of such clichés and hackneyed expressions that our language has bequeathed us are a stunning treasure trove of human insight and knowledge.
Really?
Yes.
Oh, please sit down.
During these formative college years, we should learn as many clichéd and hackneyed thoughts as possible.
Furthermore, I think we will.
Speaking of suicide prevention, do you have a boyfriend, Lily?
Are you dating anyone?
I don't see the connection.
You don't?
Boyfriends are a primary suicide risk.
You don't have any particular friend?
No one at all?
No.
Well, there's this grad student I met over summer.
Xavier.
We became pretty good pals.
He has a girlfriend whom I've met.
She's very nice.
"Zavier. " With a Z?
No, I think it's with an X. No, I'm certain it's Z.
Zavier, like Zorro.
It's the same sound.
Zorro marked his name with a Z.
It's an X.
But Zorro's with a Z.
Okay, let me see if I can figure this out.
Used at the beginning of a name, Z and X have the same pronunciation.
But it's Zorro with a Z. Actually, there were two Zorros.
One spelled his name with a Z and made a Z mark for Zorro.
And there's Xorro who spelled his name with an X, and with his sword he'd make an X mark.
What was really unfair was because he marked his name with X, everybody assumed he was illiterate when he was spelling correctly.
Hello.
Can we help you?
Of course we can.
No case is too challenging.
Would you like a doughnut?
Okay.
Please, sit down.
Here, have some coffee.
Thank you.
What's your name?
Jim Bose.
But my friends call me Jimbo.
Why?
What?
Why do your friends call you Jimbo?
Well, it's a contraction of Jim and the first part of my last name, Bose.
Yeah, I got that.
But why bother?
What do you mean?
Jim is already a lovely name.
It's short, simple, evocative.
Shouldrt a nickname simplify the name that it replaces?
Jimbo doesn't really simplify anything.
I don't know.
Well, maybe you should ask your friends.
Where do you live or reside?
Doar Dorm.
Ugh.
Oh, my God.
Yuck.
What?
The smell, it's notorious.
What smell?
You're right, it's more like a stink.
Unclean clothing, I'd say, mostly.
Vomit.
Stale beer.
Pot.
Cheap deodorant.
There might be a vermin infestation.
Did you know a good-smelling environment is crucial to our sense of well-being?
Have you tried to find a better-smelling place?
Wait, wait.
It's not me, I'm not depressed.
You're not?
No.
Are you sure?
You kind of seem on edge.
No, I'm fine.
That's a terrible expression. "Fine. "
"I'm fine. " Something smug about it. "I'm fine. "
Why do you say that you're fine?
I'm not depressed.
I'm not suicidal.
Why are you here, then?
Are you a con man?
A confidence trickster?
No, there's a girl.
Her boyfriend dumped her.
She was crying but now is silent.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you say so?
We have to go.
Call the cops!
A suicide might be in progress!
The campus cops?
Yes, of course the campus cops.
Take this.
We have a lot of students coming to the centre pretending to be depressed to get doughnuts.
Confidence tricksters.
Yes, it's really bad.
Really cynical.
We pledged to the doughnut company, we would only give doughnuts to students who were depressed or otherwise nutty.
We're a nonprofit, so the rules are pretty strict.
This man could still be a trickster.
Well, we'll soon find out.
Tell me about this girl.
Well, ahem, her name is Priss.
She's very pretty.
Oh, yes.
It's very hard for beautiful women to experience rejection.
Priss?
Priss.
Are you okay?
Priss!
Priss, say something!
Priss!
Open up!
Oh, thank God.
We're gonna have to force this door.
Priss?
Are you okay?
What?
Please don't.
Please, come with us.
Do you wanna talk about it?
What was his name?
Josh.
If you'd rather not talk, we don't have to.
No, it's okay, I just...
I keep thinking how he used to gaze at me with such love in his eyes.
You know what I mean?
No.
No, I've never actually seen that.
Yes.
Just days ago, he'd gaze at me.
His eyes, so blue.
He had blue eyes?
So does Frank.
Frank's the guy that I go out with.
Otherwise, he's not conventionally good-looking, which I actually prefer.
Would you describe Josh as handsome?
That's a problem.
Could I join you guys?
Yes, please.
Priss and I were just talking.
In my view, handsome men are to be avoided.
I don't even consider good looks to be flattering in a man.
Do you know what I mean?
No.
Cookie-cutter, good-looking guys, with their chiselled features, running around, full of themselves, getting everything they want, never suffering or experiencing...
We suffered?
We're not under discussion.
That's irrelevant.
That's besides the point.
Is this making you feel any better?
Yes.
I think so.
Good.
I hoped it would.
Okay, it's nearly 4 and The Daily Complainer's orientation meeting is about to start and I think we should go.
The editor, Rick DeWolfe, he's terrible.
A real jerk.
Why do you think he's such a jerk?
He's one of those that I was talking about.
Tall.
Probably considers himself very smart and handsome.
A journalist, so you can imagine the mindboggling arrogance and conceit.
But, Violet, don't you think...?
What?
Well, don't you think that the way you talk could be considered arrogant too?
I mean, a little?
Yes, of course.
But what's your point?
Wouldrt that be hypocritical, criticising Rick for something you could be criticised for yourself?
No.
I don't see why.
We're all flawed.
Must that render us mute to the flaws of others?
Must we tether ourselves from comment because our natures are human too?
We've got a rebel amongst us.
That's good, I think.
It's good to be challenged and criticised.
I know your intentions are good, it's just...
That's it precisely.
Our intentions are good.
We're seeking to help people rescue their lives from terrible sadness and failure, which is a won'thy goal, don't you think?
Yes.
But not exactly a humble one.
No.
I agree with you there.
You're right, absolutely.
I'd like to thank you for this chastisement.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to chastise.
No, I think you did, and I think it's good.
It's good to have a friend to put one in one's place when that's what one needs.
Now I see that I have that kind of friend in you.
I think that's great.
Hello, people.
Listen up.
People, quiet.
Quiet, people.
Shut up!
Ha-ha-ha.
Okay, that's better.
I'm Rick DeWolfe, editor of The Complainer.
Over the next weeks, I'm the person you're gonna hate most in the world.
You're gonna hate me because I'm gonna work you, point out your stupidity and incompetence, and do everything in my power to turn you into journalists.
Albeit barely literate ones.
Oh, brother.
Any questions?
No?
Yes.
How did The Daily Complainer get its name?
Hmm.
Isn't that pretty obvious?
Heh-heh.
Um, it comes out every day and it's the university daily.
So The Daily Complainer.
The Daily...
No, I meant...
Oh, you mean, why The Complainer?
The name dates from Seven Oaks' earliest days as a divinity school.
The reference is to the Book of Job.
Job's complaint with the world.
Before justice can be achieved, a complaint must be made.
That is what we do and people don't like it a bit.
Right now, what that means is extirpating Seven Oaks' elitist Roman Letter Clubs that are like a cancer on the community.
They're not elitist in the least.
Yes, they are.
Have you met any of their members?
The guys from the DU, for example?
They're barely competent for the tasks of everyday life.
They have to drink a quart of beer just to talk to a woman?
Two quarts.
Yet you salivate at the idea of taking the roof off their heads and throwing them on the street where who knows what would happen.
You call yourself a Christian.
No, I don't.
What unkindness and cruelty.
This is the darkness in the heart of man, which Joseph Conrad wrote about most eloquently.
Ooh.
He was actually Polish.
Oh, my God.
Unkind, self-righteous and pedantic.
In short, a model journalist.
You should know something about these girls.
They run the suicide centre where their preferred therapy for depressed and suicidal people is tap dancing.
I kid you not.
Tap is a highly effective therapy, as well as a dazzlingly expressive dance form that has been sadly neglected for too many years.
It's moronic and barbaric.
You expect tap dancing to solve people's problems?
No, we don't.
We're using the whole range of musical dance numbers which have proven themselves to be effective therapies for the suicidal and the hopelessly depressed.
That really got me down.
I thought you handled it well.
You did?
Thanks.
No, it's all this aggression and hostility that gets me down.
Not just his but also my own.
It leaves you feeling unclean.
Have you thought of taking a shower?
Maybe you'd feel better.
You're probably right.
No, there's something else.
What Lily was saying about me being conceited and arrogant.
I'm sorry.
No, I think you're right.
I'm really ashamed.
You're joking.
No, it's terrible how I've acted.
We're all Christians.
Or I should say Judeo-Christians.
Humility should be our watchword.
The essence of being a good person.
Humility comes from within.
If it's not there in the first place, where do you go to get it?
I stopped looking a long time ago.
Very good, Freak.
You really think so?
Yes.
Certainly.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Violet.
Is it such a good idea to call him Freak?
What?
He's already depressed and you're calling him Freak.
That's his name.
Freak.
Freak Astaire.
That's how he wants to be called.
What are you talking about?
Lily was just saying she likes your dancing.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Are you okay?
What do you mean?
I thought you looked sad and was wondering if there was anything we could do.
What could you do?
Oh, I know.
You think I'm gonna kill myself and make you look bad.
No, I'm worried that you'll kill yourself and make yourself look bad.
Do you have any idea how demoralising it is to be constantly questioned about whether you're suicidal or not?
No.
After a while, you wonder, why is everyone asking me this?
They want me to be suicidal?
Or is it just the consequence of your utter absurdity?
Excuse me.
What scent are you wearing?
What are you talking about?
The perfume you're wearing.
I'm not wearing any perfume!
You see, that could be the problem.
I've become friends with a group.
Really?
Although they're perfume-obsessed.
Oh, them?
Those girls?
The ones who volunteer at the centre?
Yeah.
But they're terrible.
The blond one?
She's notorious.
What do you mean?
Such a bitch.
Terrible, isn't she?
Would balsamic be okay?
What?
Balsamic vinegar.
For the dressing.
Oh.
Yeah, sure.
What's that?
What?
Those.
Artichokes?
Is that what they look like?
Come on, Lily.
You've seen an artichoke before.
You haven't?
They look so weird.
I'm not convinced that having a suicide-prevention centre prevents any suicides.
Well, the coffee's good.
If someone were determined to destroy themselves,
I don't think they'd stop for coffee.
It depends on what it tastes like.
Where are we going?
I thought I'd take Priss over to DU.
Why?
It might be helpful for her to meet some of the guys.
How would that be helpful?
They're morons.
Oh, come on, Lily.
No, they're morons.
No.
Not medically.
I like them.
They're in that sympathetic range of being not good-looking and yet not smart.
There's something likeable about that.
Spending time with them, you get the sense that you're making a difference.
For somebody suicidal, like Priss, that could be a real boost.
I'm not suicidal.
Oh, that's good.
It's better not to have an identity as a suicidal person, don't you think?
Well, uh, bye.
Well...
Where are you going?
Over to Xavier's.
Is that a good idea?
Why wouldn't it be?
Is his girlfriend gonna be there?
Of course.
Gosh, you're nosy.
No, no, it's just a general foreboding.
"Foreboding"?
You know, you're absolutely right.
I was being nosy.
Terribly so.
I've gotta watch that.
Yes, we must improve ourselves.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Lily.
You were coming over?
Hey.
Yeah.
Is Alice home?
Alice is working.
Oh, she is?
But it's not a problem.
It's good you came.
Let's go to the Oak Bar.
I'll buy you a beer.
I thought Alice would be back.
I'll call her.
She'll join us there.
Come on.
Okay.
She's actually quite a good person.
Her entire identity revolves around helping people.
You really think that's true?
What's she have against The Complainer?
That's bizarre.
Well, she thinks the editor, Rick DeWolfe, is completely egotistical.
And your friend isn't?
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, Lily.
Hi.
Great.
You got the message.
Yeah.
Who's egotistical?
Lily's roommate.
She sounds unbearable.
She's on a rampage against The Complainer.
Really?
Why?
She thinks the editor, Rick DeWolfe, is conceited.
And, in fact, quite mean.
Mean?
Yes.
He wants to close the Seven Oaks Roman Letter Clubs.
That's good, isn't it?
Everyone was against them.
No.
Come on.
There's no justification for those places.
They're exclusive and elitist.
The point that Violet makes is that they can't be elitist.
They're morons.
Yeah, elitist morons.
You'll grant they're morons.
That's a handicap.
Such people should be helped, not hounded and persecuted.
Persecuted?
Yes, losing the roof over your head?
That's the worst thing that can happen.
Violet thinks there could be some risk of suicide.
Because some boy might kill himself, Seven Oaks can't do what's right?
It's a factor to be considered.
Yeah.
No, it isn't.
You can't set policy that way.
Excuse me, we didn't order these.
Compliments of the guy at the bar.
That's a playboy or operator move.
Operators like that are to be avoided.
Why?
It seems generous, sending drinks to people you don't know.
Drinks are expensive.
Drinks to two gorgeous girls.
His intention was to seduce and he assumed he could.
Both?
That seems a bit harsh.
You don't know what he was thinking.
Was he alone?
Yes.
You see?
He was alone and probably lonely.
He could see that Alice and Lily were students.
Students are known for their intelligent conversation.
They can always talk about their courses.
That was probably what attracted him.
Nonsense.
Perhaps his view was even loftier.
To court Lily with a view to matrimony.
We're in the north, but a southern gentleman can wander into these parts.
Rubbish.
Seeing Lily across a crowded bar filled with the usual undergraduate slobs.
Why wouldn't a thoughtful young man seek her out?
She's lovely.
Isn't it incumbent on men and women to find ways to meet each other?
Buying drinks for a person you don't know seems to be a generous one.
Yes.
Most guys won't even pay for the women they do know.
What you've described is a playboy or operator move.
I'll grant you that it's a tactic or perhaps even a ruse, but without some of that, would our species even survive?
The Lord said, "Be fruitful and multiply. "
Oh, my gosh.
No, this is how the world works, seeing someone across a room.
This could be the romantic story you tell your grandchildren.
And if you do marry and have children, then he'll really learn how to squander cash.
Isn't it good to know that he's basically generous from the start?
Where's Priss?
Your eyes are so striking.
So blue.
Really?
They're blue?
Yes.
The most piercing blue.
You must know your eyes are blue.
No.
What do you mean?
What?
Heh.
You must know what colour your eyes are.
Your eyes are very blue.
You know that.
I'm not gonna go around checking what colour my eyes are.
When you look in the mirror, you see that your eyes are blue.
Oh, come on.
What?
I don't think my eyes have a colour.
If my eyes are so blue looking out, wouldn't everything be kind of blue?
Like, have a bluish tinge to it?
Doesrt.
Just looks normal.
That's...?
That's blue?
That colour?
Yes, of course.
Then what colour is that?
Green.
You're saying that chair's green but Frank's eyes are blue?
Yes.
Then what colour are the walls?
Also green.
Huh.
You didn't know that?
No.
How's that possible?
You think knowing the colours is so important?
You're in college and you don't know the colours?
Doesrt that embarrass you?
Well, no.
Why should it?
That's why the 'rents are paying big bucks to send me here.
You know, to learn stuff.
Well, gotta go hit the books.
I don't think anyone should feel embarrassed about not knowing stuff.
What's embarrassing is pretending to know.
Or putting people down because you think they don't know as much.
Look, I'm happy to admit I'm completely ignorant.
That's why I'm here and plan to really hit the books.
So the next time you see me, I will know more than I do now.
I'll be older but also wiser.
Or at least know more stuff.
For me, that's education.
Cheers.
Thor's great.
He's very clear about his objectives.
He really wants to learn things.
Frank?
What a jerk.
He's a monster.
Oh, my gosh, Violet.
You did everything for them.
They're nothing without you.
What a rat.
He's a moron.
Don't waste a tear on that creep.
Don't waste a single breath.
Jerk.
Stop.
Please.
What?
I love Frank.
I love him.
Come on, Violet, Frank's a moron.
You are well rid of him.
Don't say that.
Frank's not a moron?
You know, Lily, you're a bit harsh.
This obsession with intelligence.
Do you think it has some magical quality transforming everything?
The intelligence line is not an immutable barrier.
Love can cross it.
You can love someone whose mental capacity is not large.
I know.
I have.
Well, there's a mutable barrier, then.
Frank's stupid, we knew.
That he's a rat playboy operator, I hadrt realised.
I don't want to turn bitter.
I worry for Frank.
I care about him.
Well, I'd stop.
No.
I love Frank.
I always will.
If that's the case, why not fight for him?
Against Priss?
I'd never win.
Sure you would.
Priss is a rat.
A bitch.
A rat bitch.
Don't blame Priss.
She was crushed when her blue-eyed Josh left her.
I should've known.
Of course she'd fall for Frank.
Josh and Frank are both blue-eyed heartbreakers.
Poor Violet.
She's the roommate who's so self-confident?
Yeah.
But now she's a wreck.
But there's no logic to the algebra of love.
"The algebra of love. " Mm-hm.
That sounds like the title to some lame book.
It's a title, but the book's not lame at all.
Love's algebra?
I thought it was more geometry.
Okay, the title's not good, but the book is.
What's it say?
Well, that while we're all perverse in our romantic preferences, there's actually this logic or algebra to our perversity, and it has something to do with how the species has evolved.
The survival of the species?
Yes.
And whether it will continue to do so.
No booze?
Just to find the nearest package store, you had to drive 40 miles.
These aren't so strong.
No, they're really strong.
I think I'd like another.
That wouldn't be a good idea.
Why not?
Well...
Are you trying to stifle me?
Lily?
Oh, hi.
Listen, we're gonna get something to eat.
Why don't you come with us?
I'm with Charlie.
I can see that.
But you really should come.
Why?
I just think it would be a good idea.
But why?
You really must come.
I insist.
Lily?
Lily?
Lily, are you angry?
Lily, this is it.
We're here.
What's the matter?
That was so rude.
He's a nice guy and you embarrassed him.
He's not nice.
He was trying to get you drunk.
No, he wasn't.
Plying you with martinis?
I was plying myself with martinis.
Come on, the guy's a total sleaze.
A creep.
You don't know anything about him.
The way he sent drinks over to our table?
Alice.
Alice, what's wrong?
I had no idea that Xavier could be so mean.
Sounds as if he was just trying to protect you.
This Charlie Walker sounds like an operator or playboy type.
No, he's not like that.
He's actually a really nice guy.
I thought he was a slick businessman.
No.
He dresses well, but he works in strategic development.
What?
Strategic development.
He works at SDA.
Strategic Development Associates.
He's an associate there.
What he is, is a strategic operator.
Violet, are you okay?
Hey, miss, rairs coming!
Better get back!
Polly, have you seen Violet?
No.
Is something wrong?
We're not sure.
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
Oh, my gosh, what happened?
I don't understand.
What were you doing?
How long were you gone for?
I'm sorry, I don't know.
I lost track of time.
But you feel better now?
Well, cleaner.
She'll say anything to get in the show.
She'll want doughnuts.
You don't have to be suicidal to get doughnuts, just depressed.
Clinically depressed.
From a clinic.
Would you say you're depressed?
I don't like the term.
I prefer to say I'm in a tailspin.
Oh, my God.
A tailspin?
She can't even say she's depressed.
She's gotta say something special.
Priss was honest.
She was depressed and she had a right to be in the show.
Now every silly tailspinner's trying to get in.
The show is for everyone.
No, it isn't, Freak.
To be in the centre's programmes, you have to be clinically depressed.
That means that you've been to a clinic, and they've said that you're depressed.
Have you been to a clinic?
Have you been to a clinic?
Then you're not clinically depressed.
Violet.
Violet.
What is it?
Where are you going?
All I wanted was to make Frank happy.
I had all these plans.
Things we could've done together.
I never even got to tell him.
Hey!
Where all your boyfriends at?
Come on!
They don't wear bikinis.
They're ladies, they wear thongs.
I can't imagine where she could've gone.
Wherever she went, she should be back by now.
How did she seem when you last saw her?
Really sad about Frank.
Still?
Yeah.
How can someone so smart continue mooning over a dope like that?
People aren't exactly as you assume.
The Violet you know bears little resemblance to the girl I met in seventh grade.
You met Violet in seventh grade?
Well, her name wasn't Violet then.
What's your name?
You can tell us your name.
We won't bite.
What's your name?
Tell us.
Are you retarded?
Tell us your name.
Emily Tweeter.
Tweeter?
Like a bird?
That's ridiculous.
Tweeter?
Like a bird?
Not an easy name to have at that age.
Not at any age.
What was she like?
Timid.
Bookish.
Classic scholarship student.
Her parents were writers.
They didn't have a dime.
Finances were the least of her worries.
What do you mean?
Well, she was crazy.
I got stuck rooming with her on a trip when no one else would.
It was awful.
Did she smell bad?
No.
Obsessive cleanliness was part of her insanity.
You were nice to her.
No.
The idea of being nice to weird kids hadrt arrived.
Why was she so unpopular?
Well, she was very strange.
Constantly setting herself odd, repetitive tasks.
Tasks?
For example, on that trip she had with her a little square suitcase.
The idea came into her head she had to move it in a precise pattern over and over again, and if she didn't execute this movement flawlessly 10 times, she'd start over.
Another was to slide her hand across her forehead, trying not to touch her hair or eyebrows on either side, also repeating it 10 times.
Any niggling thought she'd touched the hair, she'd start over.
My God, that is insane.
Why would she do that?
She had the conviction that if she didn't complete these tasks, her parents would die.
Was she Catholic?
No.
But what made the whole thing really sad was that her parents did die.
Oh, my God.
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
Violet?
Violet!
Violet, where are you?
Something's wrong, isn't it, dear?
You mind my asking?
Well, I do mind a little.
Excuse me, Your Highness.
I'm sorry.
It's just kind of awkward to talk about.
No matter.
I hope you haven't come to get run over on the highway.
What do you mean?
Suicides.
They come down from the university.
Jump out in the road.
Get hit by the blind curve.
Hope you're not one of them.
Do I look like one of them?
I don't know.
Maybe.
Messy people, suicides.
Think only of themselves and their own deaths.
Not what comes after.
They leave quite a mess.
Mm-hm.
They don't stick around to clean it up.
Mm-mm.
So you're not one of those depressed students from the university?
I don't like the word "depressed. " I prefer to say that I'm in a tailspin.
A tailspin?
Does this tailspin involve a man?
Yes, it does.
But I'm not as crazy as I was up till yesterday.
Apparently that's due to the salutary effect of scent on the human psyche.
Its importance is, I believe, almost incalculable.
At the motel, I happened to use this soap.
It was provided to me as a courtesy as one of the guests.
That an economical motel would provide such good soap is quite unusual.
The scent is very precise.
Really?
Tell me if it provokes any particular reaction in your psyche.
A state of mind.
Hmm.
I always knew she was unstable.
They're gonna have her photo at the registrar's.
Violet!
Violet!
You're back!
You're okay!
Not really.
Oh, my gosh, Violet, we were so worried.
Why didn't you tell us or leave a note?
I did leave a note.
Would that be a suicide note?
I wouldn't leave without a note.
Where did you go?
I took the train to Villafranca and checked into a motel there.
The Motel 6?
No, the Motel 4.
It's even less expensive.
The Motel 4 in Villafranca?
My God, you really were suicidal.
Why'd you go?
I had to do something.
And you really thought you were gonna find the answer in Villafranca?
I'm not sure what I expected, but I might have found it.
What?
Soap?
This scent and this soap is what gives me hope.
Hello?
Hello?
Is anyone here?
Hello?
Lily?
Hello?
Oh, my gosh.
I couldn't understand where everyone was.
Sorry, I just went out to get some things.
Where's Alice?
Gone.
What do you mean?
Left.
We broke up.
But when you called, you said...
I know, I'm sorry.
I thought it better to tell you in person.
Alice couldn't control her jealousy.
It completely overwhelmed her.
Really?
What was she jealous of?
Come on.
No, what?
You.
After a while, I just couldn't handle it.
Things became impossible.
She was jealous of me?
Of course.
Would it be okay if we watch a film?
Yes.
Um...
What would you like to see?
I thought maybe Truffaut's Baisers v olés.
Stolen Kisses.
Do you know it?
No, is it new?
It's a classic of French New Wave cinema.
I think you'll like it.
But it's in colour?
Yeah.
You don't know Truffaut?
No.
Do you know Godard, À bout de souffle?
Why was Alice so jealous?
What do you think?
She was jealous because Lily's lovely.
I don't know.
They had a lot of problems.
Of course.
You wouldn't break up a happy couple.
What's that?
A note Frank left.
Really?
Recently?
No, when we were together.
Now that most correspondence is electronic, it's rare to be left anything written by hand.
Frank can write by hand?
What is it?
It's not very important.
It's just all I have.
What's it say?
"Out for brewskis.
Back in a giff. "
What's a "giff"?
One of those little motor scooters, isn't it?
I'm sure he meant to write "jiff" with a J. "Back in a jiff. "
But he wrote "giff. "
Could Frank be dyslexic?
No.
Dyslexics are intelligent.
What's that?
Frank's bean ball.
He gave you his bean ball?
Not exactly.
This is an extra.
He thought he'd leave it here just in case he lost his other one.
Gosh, Violet, you've really gotta stop thinking about Frank.
Why?
I don't wanna stop thinking about him.
Recently I had a thought that cheered me up a lot.
Life is like a long, flowing river, and as a long, flowing river, some debris you never expect to see again is almost certain to reappear floating to the surface.
Frank and I may very well be together again one day.
Maybe it'll take years, but somewhere down the line, he's very likely to pop up again, and I'll be there to catch him.
I don't think we've spoken about this.
What?
Have you been to the south of France?
To the walled city of Carcassonne?
I've never been anywhere.
But you've seen pictures of it.
No, I don't think so.
Oh, it's fascinating.
I'd like to visit.
You never studied the Cathars?
They were a religious movement, very idealistic, located mostly in the southwest of France that the Catholic Church repressed.
Oh, my God.
The Catholic Church is, like, always bad.
Ideas can't be killed as easily as people.
Especially such enlightened ones as the Cathars held.
In recent years, more and more people have returned to their beliefs.
So you're a Cathar?
Yes.
I aspire to be.
I'm trying to follow the path the Cathars marked out.
That's so impressive.
I can tell you we didn't have any Cathars back home.
I think you'd be surprised.
In the Cathar view, the highest form of lovemaking avoids procreation entirely.
Sure.
Condoms, right?
Well, according to Cathar ideas, sex with condoms is just a parody of the procreative act.
Mm.
What do you mean?
The standard, cliché form of sexual intercourse is for the man to approach a woman from the front.
Cathar lovemaking, I think you'll find very fulfilling.
I'll be very careful, we'll go slowly.
It'll be a new experience, but one which I think you'll find brings an inexpressible closeness.
Might your drinks-buying friend be around?
It would be great to get complimentary cocktails.
Charlie?
No.
Do you still see him at all?
He calls from time to time.
He does?
Why don't you introduce us?
Why should I introduce you?
Because you know him, and we don't.
So?
"So?"
"So" is probably the unkindest word in the English language.
I can't bear it.
I think it should be outlawed. "So. "
You're crazy.
Come on, Lily, you have Xavier.
You can't keep two guys for yourself.
Guys do that all the time.
We're not guys, fortunately.
It's unconscionable for you not to bring him and introduce us.
Charlie is a friend.
He's a nice guy.
What do you mean?
I hate to think what'd happen if you got your claws into him.
That's outrageous.
We're perfectly nice.
We've met lots of pathetic guys and nothing bad's happened.
Charlie's not pathetic.
Well, all the better, then.
The Roman Holidays will be coming soon.
What's that?
A festival Roman Letter Clubs put on.
A kind of moron jamboree.
The Roman elements are the worship of Bacchus, Beerus and Blotto.
It could've all been so uplifting.
Charlie.
Hey, Charlie.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Have you the day off?
Yeah.
This is my friend Charlie, whom I think I've mentioned.
And, Charlie, these are my roommates.
This is, um...
This is Rose.
And this is Heather.
And Violet.
Charlie works for Strategic Development Associates.
He's an associate there.
You work in strategic development?
You've heard of it?
Of course, yes.
My cousin Jay in Philadelphia works in strategic development.
Something business-related?
Mostly business, but any kind of organisation.
Only businesses pay the big bucks.
Nonprofits and government pay well.
That's how they keep from having profits, by paying lots of money to companies like yours.
Excuse me, but aren't you in Professor Ryars course at the Ed School?
No.
You're not in Professor Ryars Flit Lit course?
No.
Flit Lit?
The dandy tradition in literature.
I'm sure I've seen you there.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm not in any courses at the Ed School.
Good to meet you.
It was great to see you.
Bye.
God, Violet, what was that about?
That guy is definitely in Professor Ryars class.
Not possible.
He has a fulltime job for Strategic Development Associates.
He never got his coffee.
Why lie about something like that?
He's lying.
I find that very attractive.
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna stop cutting Professor Ryars class.
It can be argued that Firbank was too little disciplined, too unserious in his unseriousness to create works of enduring value.
But as a liberating influence on later writers such as Waugh, his importance should not be discounted.
It's not Firbank's work itself but the idea of his work that so helped later writers as Thomas Love Peacock did in the previous century.
I'm not gonna come anymore.
What a waste of time.
Charlie.
Charlie.
Charlie?
Charlie, you are taking the course.
Charlie?
Who's Charlie?
Fred, what's going on?
Fred?
Uh-oh.
Fred.
Sounds like you got some explaining to do.
Well, you were lying.
I wasn't lying, I was making it up.
Why were you making it up?
If you were an eighth-year Ed School student, would you advertise that?
Eighth year.
Impressive.
But your whole life was a lie.
Dressing up in suits.
Buying people drinks.
The suits were real.
The drinks, real.
Not just drinks for people.
They were for cute girls.
There's a perfectly rational, easily explainable agenda.
So it was a playboy or operator move.
Of course.
Transparently so.
I admire that.
Drinks are expensive.
But strategic development, that was made up too?
You said your cousin Jay was in it.
What cousin Jay?
In Philadelphia.
I don't have a cousin in Philadelphia.
You said your cousin Jay was working in strategic development.
I was just saying that to be friendly.
To make a kind of link.
So your name's Fred something?
Yes.
Fred something.
Packenstacker?
Oh, my God.
How crazy.
He's completely insane.
I almost dated him.
You can say that about a lot of guys.
I don't think he's crazy.
Making up an entirely fictitious identity, that's not crazy?
It's insane.
It's psycho.
Violet's identity is made up.
I don't think she's crazy.
No, I am.
No, this is different.
It's crazy and pathetic.
All that about strategic development he just made up.
Don't tell me that's not weird.
I've heard of strategic development.
I think it's something pretty important.
Violet, you're not gonna start going out with him.
You're not, are you?
Well, we had planned to go to the library.
Not to the stacks, I hope.
Yes.
Oh, my gosh, do you realise how dangerous that is?
Dangerous?
Yes, the stacks.
They're dark and deserted.
Anything could happen.
It's true.
With the study habits at Seven Oaks, your body won't be found until spring.
Promise you won't go with him to the stacks.
Please.
Okay.
I'll suggest the Randall Room.
Don't suggest.
Insist.
And please not at night.
Okay.
What are you reading?
Have you chosen a topic for your final paper?
The decline of decadence.
You think that decadence has declined?
Definitely.
Bigtime.
Major, major decline.
How?
How or in what ways?
Either.
Well, take the flit movement in literature, or homosexuality.
It's gone completely downill, right down the tubes.
Poof!
What do you mean?
Before, homosexuality was something refined, hidden, aspiring to the highest levels of creativity and often achieving it.
Now it seems to be musclebound morons running around in T-shirts.
It's pretty disillusioning.
Are you gay?
Not especially, but in another era, it might have had some appeal.
Now I just don't see the point.
You might be romanticising the past.
We'll never know.
The past is gone, so we might as well romanticise it.
Hmm.
You could be right.
I wanted to ask, how's Lily?
Lily.
She's okay.
Here, check it out.
A.L.A. Nope.
Hello.
Good afternoon.
Check it out.
The A.L.A. Heard of it?
We have a meeting on Tuesday.
You should come by.
What is the A.L.A.?
Oh.
Just join us.
Come Tuesday.
I think you'll really like it.
So...
A fellow was passing these out, and invited us to a meeting on Tuesday.
The A.L.A.?
Oh, my God.
I thought it was something related.
No?
The A.L.A. Has got nothing to do with us.
Can't you see that?
The way we express love has meaning.
It's in the context of something beautiful.
We're following our creator's teaching.
Aspiring to an ideal.
A beautiful one that brings an inexpressible closeness.
Not just to each other, but...
For the A.L.A., and those like them, the love act is just hedonistic pleasure-seeking of a perverted nature.
I can't believe you'd think we had anything in common with them.
We don't.
Nothing, not an iota.
My God, can't you see that?
Lily.
Lily, come back.
Please.
Don't be that way.

Oh, my gosh, Lily.
Are you okay?
It's all right.
You don't wanna talk about it?
I don't understand.
You don't understand what?
What is non-procreative lovemaking?
It could be a lot of things.
Yeah, but in this case?
We don't have to talk about this.
I don't mind.
Could somebody explain what this is about?
Well, if...
Cathars don't believe in procreative sex.
They don't have intercourse the usual way.
The usual way?
You don't have to talk about this.
No, it's okay.
It's the normal way, from the front where you can have procreation, not from the other side, where you can't.
The other side?
That's their religion?
No, but it's the direction their beliefs head in.
When they express love, that's what they do.
Wow.
How horrible.
You poor girl.
What?
That's terrible, what he obliged Lily to do.

I'm fati-ged. "
She was so depressed, she had to get everything her own way.
"I'm so stressed.
Frantic. "
Man.
What a bitch.
Priss dumped you?
No.
It was mutual.
Oh, listen, I have a question.
You remember that bean ball that I left in your room?
Yeah.
Do you still have it?
Yeah.
Do you think I could get it back?
I lost the other one, and with everything that's happened,
I'd really like to have it.
Nothing like some bean ball after a breakup.
Yeah.
God, you're smart.
You always get it.
Whatever I say, you understand.
Man.
# Lucy, you know The world must be flat #
# 'Cause when people leave town #
Hey, Heather.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
# Put the pedal to the metal 'fore they change their mind #
Hey.
# Howl at the moon Shoot out the light #
# It's a small town Saturday night #
# It's a small town Saturday night #
# Bobby told Lucy The world ain't round ##
Violet.
Violet, what's wrong?
I'm sorry.
Lily's lovely.
Now she's free.
Go.
I understand.
Latin!
Et cetera!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Ha-ha!
This is what comes from not teaching Latin in the schools.
Yeah, it's moronic and boorish, but it's also kind of fun, don't you think?
No.
What's that stench?
I suppose this is what happens when decadence rots society from within.
And from without.
Such a society is, I fear, destined to fail and be overrun.
Maybe that's good.
Finally.
It's about time those cesspools were drained.
What colour would you say that chair is?
That's a chair?
I have no idea.
Guys have preferences.
You're going to accept that?
You're not going to do anything?
There's nothing to be done.
Fred must know his own mind.
Oh, really?
I seriously doubt that.
Come on.
Lily's got that slender, delicately swelling beauty that no man can resist.
Okay, you're probably right.
Poor Lily.
Just think of all Xavier put her through.
He just used her body.
And not even the right side.
Have you noticed that good people tend to have large posteriors?
Not everyone, by any means.
I know it's not logical.
But it does seem to be true.
The genetic link between morality and large posteriors?
Yes, I think that's well known.
You and Violet have that build.
It's nice.
You're still very attractive, but also sensible and moralistic.
I don't.
I have narrow hips, but also no very strong principles.
Yes?
Oh, hi.
Hi, Frank.
Hey, Heather.
Wow.
So I guess you guys all heard.
University's closing all the Roman Letter Houses.
Sorry.
This year's Roman Holidays did seem like the end of civilisation, but when civilisation ends people are going to need a place to stay.
Man.
It's bad.
It's that bastard from The Complainer.
Someone from the administratiors been reading it.
Hard to believe.
Bastard.
Listen, we were wondering if you thought it would be okay if we stayed at the suicide centre.
Okay, sure.
That sounds like a good stopgap measure.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, um...
So there's one more thing.
Remember that bean ball we talked about?
Yes.
You think I could pick that up?
Just after everything that's happened, it...
I could really use it right now.
Yes.
What's that?
What?
The note.
Oh.
One gets so few things written by hand anymore, I guess I kept it.
"Out for brewskis, back in a giff. "
What's a giff?
It's the scooter.
Like a Vespa, right?
That's what I thought.
I was thinking about getting one.
You must've meant "jiff. " "Back in a jiff. "
And then misspelled it, or spelled it in a nonstandard way.
Oh...
Heh.
Yeah.
Not a good speller.
Mm.
Thanks.
You're great.
Priss was such a bitch.
Damn.
Ha-ha.
Damn.
Hey, Heather.
Bye.
Bye.
Ha-ha.
Bye.
Bye.
Wow.
Heather is really cute.
She, um, going out with anyone?
There might be something between her and Thor.
Thor?
Damn.
Heather and Thor?
Damn.
I'm worried about Thor.
It's hard for us to imagine how upsetting it is not knowing the colours.
It's impossible for me to imagine.
When Thor sees a rainbow, it's so much gibberish to him.
There was one this afternoon.
Oh, my gosh, he took it hard.
Recently, there was a parade in the city where the marchers carried rainbow-coloured flags and banners.
Thor was so upset.
He had no idea what it meant.
What kind of retard is he?
See, that's the conclusion people jump to.
Well, it is somewhat understandable.
Not if you knew the full story.
What's the full story?
You know how parents love bragging about how precocious their children are?
Thor's parents had become precocity addicts, constantly needing an ever-greater precocity fix.
He should've entered kindergarten.
They pushed him into first grade.
"Thor skipped a grade," they could tell.
What Thor's parents failed to consider is the work done in nursery school.
Key being the study of colours.
I suppose they just assumed that colours are knowledge people pick up.
Like, for example, not stepping on sidewalk cracks.
What's that?
I think Rose is sleeping.
Am I boring?
No, not at all.
When you have problems, it's great to hear someone else's idiotic ones.
Please go on.
Wow.
What?
What you said about depressed people being mean, you werert joking.
I'm sorry, you're right.
Please go on.
No.
I'm sorry.
You know how I am.
Please continue.
Thor decided he absolutely had to learn all the colours.
Both primary and mixed.
He's been hitting the books hard, and thought he'd mastered them.
Then, in town, he said, "That traffic light's blue. "
I had to say, "No, it's green. "
He was really upset.
Oh, hi, Lily.
Hi.
We were worried about you.
I can't bear this tension with Lily.
It's terrible to have the group divided this way.
Better not next to Robertson.
What?
Didrt you hear?
Ed students have been going up to the roof and throwing themselves off.
But it's only two storeys.
Yes, I know.
It's terrible.
Not high enough to kill, but high enough to maim.
And particularly dangerous for anyone below.
I've got to forget about Fred.
But you really liked him.
This whole thing of a person meeting someone else first, it's so arbitrary.
It's terrible and cruel.
I have to say, I was wrong about Fred.
I thought he was a playboy or operator type.
In fact, he's just another guy rendered helpless by the attentions of a pretty girl.
Cary!
No, don't!
I love you!
Why did you do that?
Oh, my God!
Cary, I love you!
Isn't the Ed School essentially a teacher's college?
Yeah.
If they can't even destroy themselves, how are they going to teach America's youth?
# It's just that my happiness Finally commences #
# Things are looking up #
# I've been looking The landscape over #
# And it's covered With four-leaf clover #
# Oh, things are looking up #
# Since love looked up at me #
# But no more Will I be the mourner #
# For I've certainly turned the corner ##
What do you think you're doing?
Sorry.
Did I disturb you?
Why are you wearing tap shoes?
You out of your mind?
I think that's pretty clear.
I'm so sick of that.
Oh, really?
I think it's cute.
Since you won't be treating us to one of your incompetent tap routines, why don't you take those things off?
No.
We'll do the routine.
Rose.
Madge wants to see the routine.
I don't want to see your routine.
I asked you to take those off.
We need a break.
Just briefly, please.
It's helpful to have an audience.
Rose, the music.
I'm gonna report you.
Suzanne.
For me, it'd be Madame Curie, Simone de Beauvoir, and Margaret Sanger.
Good.
Violet.
I would say
Richard Strauss, Roderick Charleston, and Chubbard Checker.
Richard Strauss?
The composer?
Yes, that was one of his posts.
I'm not familiar with the others.
Could you tell us who they are?
Yes.
Each one of these men started an international dance craze.
Richard Strauss, the waltz.
Roderick Charleston, the Charleston.
Chubbard Checker, known as Chubby, the dance we know as the twist.
Why do you consider a dance craze important?
Dance crazes enance and elevate the human experience, bringing together millions of people in a joyous celebration of our God-given faculties, and passing these modes of physical expression down through the generations.
Though not so much anymore.
I thought...
Well, I assumed that the Charleston was named after the city of Charleston.
No.
Though that misconception is quite widely held.
It was Roderick Charleston.
Usually, behind some great creative phenomenon, there's a person, not a town.
This is so exciting.
It's really great, isn't it?
Hey, could you guys help?
Sure.
What's up?
We need help packing soap, which we'll distribute to Doar Dorm residents.
Cool.
What would you say are effective means to fight depression?
Maybe some of your DU brothers have an idea?
Uh...
Beer?
No.
Beer's a downer.
Cocktails.
Hard liquor and spirits is what really gives you a lift.
It's interesting what you say.
My cousin Jay is a medical officer in Philadelphia.
He says that alcoholism, by which I mean chronic, excessive consumption of alcohol, is the primary self-administered treatment for depression.
Cool.
No.
It leaves you much worse off than before.
Oh, no, not me.
I just boot and then I feel fine.
By "boot" do you mean vomit?
Yes.
No.
None of the effective anti-suicide treatments involve vomiting.
Hygiene?
Exactly.
It's very important.
That's why we have such hope in the wonder bar.
Do you know its scent?
Wow.
Transformative, we think.
This is so exciting.
When should we go over there?
I don't think there's any rush.
I'd like to go soon.
Doar Dorm has the highest fatality rate, as well as the worst hygiene.
Highest suicide rate.
Fatality rate.
It's uncertain what percentage were intentional and how many were just due to unawareness of gravity's laws.
I can just see those guys getting the gold packages, opening them, and finding the good-smelling soap inside.
The cute packaging should prove irresistible.
And once clean, they'll start to see the world with new eyes.
The change could be dramatic.
Doar Dorm could soon become Dior Dorm.
I doubt that, to be perfectly, absolutely honest.
I love the idea.
Dior Dorm.
I adore optimism, even when it's completely absurd.
Perhaps especially then.
Great.
Ready?
Let's go.
Let's hurry.
Let's not get our hopes up too high, Heather.
No, you said yourself, the wonder bar is transformative.
Hey, Violet.
Hi.
Hi.
Where you going?
Doar Dorm.
Fred, hi.
Hey.
Good one.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
I guess it wasn't realistic to expect Doar Dorm to turn into Dior Dorm overnight.
They wouldn't even open them.
They said without the soap, the discs wouldn't fly properly.
Are you coming Friday?
Violet's launching her dance craze.
Oh, really?
That's great.
What's the dance?
The Sambola.
The devil's dance.
Oh, cool.
We'll go, right?
Yes, I'd like to.
But I have several papers to finish.
But I'd like to.
Great.
Thanks, Gus.
I don't see how we're going to start a dance craze if no guys show up.
Most guys aren't very good with the dance-craze thing.
Very good news.
I was just in my procrastination seminar and the two guys from Doar Dorm had showered.
It was clear they'd used soap.
Oh, my gosh, what a difference.
Seems they'd been throwing packages so energetically, a soap bar fell out.
The unfamiliar ivory-like object intrigued them and one thing led to another, and, well...
It was just as you said.
Isn't that great?
Oh, look, here's Jimbo.
Jimbo doesn't count.
Where is everybody?
Arert we gonna be late for Violet's dance craze?
You wanna go to that?
Yeah.
You're kidding.
No, I love dance crazes.
Gosh, you're strange.
But aren't we already late?
No, it's later on.
Like 10, I think.
I have to confess, I've started losing patience with Violet.
Depression calls for serious treatment.
Medication.
Psychopharmaceuticals.
Talk therapy.
Are those approaches effective?
Despite the medication and therapy,
Ed School students are still throwing themselves off Robertson Hall.
Violet's ideas might seem a little offbeat...
A little?
Oh, my God.
I don't know how much you know about Violet, but there's some pretty weird stuff.
You know, Violet.
Violet Wister.
It's not even her real name.
It isn't?
No, it's Emily Tweeter.
When she was 11, she went completely crazy and has had several relapses since.
So it's a little worrisome to have her counsel nearly suicidal individuals.
I can't believe it.
What?
Emily Tweeter.
In first grade, I had an enormous crush on a girl with that name.
And you remember that?
Yeah.
Pretty huge Dr. Zhivago stuff.
Any idea or even mention of her filled me with emotion.
I had a strange perspective on the world.
I don't think my brain was functioning properly.
Everything was a bit of a dream.
You think this was Violet?
You have any idea if Violet attended Willamette Montessori?
In Portland?
We didn't order these.
Compliments of the guy at the bar.
It was so brutal how it ended between us.
I know I was too angry and a bit crazy, but I thought that what we had was stronger than that.
That you would not just walk away after one disagreement.
It wasn't just that.
Oh.
You mean my Cathar beliefs.
Well, ahem,
I am no longer a Cathar.
How is that possible?
It's been very difficult.
You've dropped your adherence to the Cathar faith?
Yes, I have.
Good.
Heh-heh.
Normally I'd be reluctant to comment on anyone's religion, but...
What?
I'm sorry.
I guess...
I guess I'm a bit of a bigot.
I just...
I could never take seriously any religion that worships on Tuesdays.
Major religions require worship on the weekend.
Friday, Saturday or Sunday.
I find it just really laudatory that people sacrifice their weekend time to worship God.
Having the Sabbath on Tuesday always seemed very bizarre to me.
It's not right.
You know what?
We'd better get to the Lone Star.
Why are you so concerned about that?
Well, it's not as if international dance crazes start every day.
We'd better hurry.
What's wrong?
Another fiasco.
Sometimes our struggle reminds me of the myth of Sisyphus.
Who?
The myth about the guy who pushes an enormous rock only to have it keep rolling back.
Oh, yeah.
What a knucklehead.
The important thing to remember is that he was mythical.
He never really existed.
Violet?
Did you spend any part of your education at Willamette Montessori?
In Oregon?
Why?
Sound like "tweaker. "
Would you say today is very grey?
I'd say so.
Maybe blue-grey.
Yeah, no, that rings a bell now.
Bye.
I'm sorry.
Her name wasn't Emily Tweeter, but Lucy Wurlitzer.
They're not similar.
I'm beginning to realise that the human memory is not the foolproof instrument we sometimes imagine.
What's worse, everyone knew about my obsession, including my parents, those from whom I most wanted it kept.
So from your earliest years, you were already a playboy or operator type?
Yes.
I suppose that's why secrecy seemed so desirable.
Violet, can we talk?
What's the plural of doofus?
Doufi.
Not doofuses?
You can say either.
"Doufi" respects the Latin root and is preferred.
"Doofuses" is also correct, although a bit inelegant.
You've thought a lot about this.
Yes, I've had to.
Mm.
Why?
What is it?
I like Fred, he's a nice guy.
And I can see why you like him.
When I first met you and Rose, I thought you were the cool crowd.
And in many ways you are.
I find your perfume and fashion sense excellent.
Thank you.
But there's a reason, I think, why you are so strongly attracted to... doufi.
And it's not an accident how different groups divide up.
Isn't that a rainbow?
That's a rainbow!
Thor.
No, Thor!
Thor, no!
Stop!
Please, stop!
He's headed for Robertson Hall!
Red.
Orange.
Yellow.
Green.
Blue.
Indigo.
Hallelujah!
Lord God, thank you.
Education.
Education.
We can learn the subjects we set out to master, no matter how hard or impossible they may seem.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I wasn't sure I was gonna make it.
Magenta.
Pink.
Gold.
I miss my nice American friend.
No, you're mistaken.
You go to London for four weeks?
Six.
It's dangerous, parents letting children travel.
They send them off and they don't know what they'll be getting back.
I don't know what you're referring to.
You're not from London.
I'm from London.
I was there, now I'm here.
I'm from London.
I just miss my nice American friend.
Nice?
Nice?
Fine.
I'm fine.
Those are not adjectives I like to use.
God gave us abilities.
He requires that we use them.
Good, better, best, excelsior, higher.
Only excellence can glorify the Lord.
Vulgarity is, in essence, blasphemous.
I'm sorry for what I was saying before.
Of course you're not linked to the doufi, or even that such distinctions are valid.
No, don't apologise.
I probably do have a doufi orientation.
But behind coolness, isn't there a certain repressing, squashing down, or lack of cultivation of one's humanity?
Oh, so you think that cool people have less humanity?
No, I don't think cool people are entirely inuman.
Just enough to be cool.
In our society, there's all this propaganda, in favour of uniqueness, eccentricity, et cetera.
But does the world really want or need more of such traits?
Arert such people usually terrible pains in the neck?
What the world needs to work properly is a large mass of normal people.
I would like to be one of those.
Sorry.
But you'll still do the part?
Yeah, of course.
So do you know every number in every Fred Astaire movie?
There were two in our school musical.
I know those.
Did performing those two numbers help you overcome feelings of discouragement and despair?
Absolutely.
Freak.

- Look.
- Where?
There.
Yes.
I think so.
Hello.
Are you a new student?
- Yes.
- Good.
We thought so.
We'd like to help you.
Help me?
What do you mean?
As a freshman, it can be very tough.
You get to college and it's supposed to be great, but it's not.
University life can be pretty bad.
- There are a lot of suicides.
- Well, attempted ones.
I'm not actually a freshman.
I'm a transfer student.
- Oh, an entering sophomore?
- Yes.
You were unhappy and are looking to recover here.
- Well, I think you will.
- Yes.
Would you welcome that?
Would our help be something you'd appreciate?
Or would you rather sink or swim on your own?
- Either way is fine.
We'll be friends.
- Yes, whichever you'd prefer.
Yes.
Sure.
Great.
We should start immediately.
Clothes can be crucial for confidence and an overall sense of well-being.
- Clothes don't have to be expensive.
- You need friends of the same size.
- You don't like my clothes?
- I'm just saying.
Move it out.
What?
What's wrong?
- What's wrong?
- You didn't notice that?
- No.
What?
- Those guys.
That smell.
That awful, acrid odour.
Have you heard of nasal shock syndrome?
Any harsh, acrid or just disgusting odour sends Rose into nasal shock.
Just from some BO?
"Just some BO"?
Oh, my God, Lily.
You must have a very high threshold for pain.
That'll serve you well at Seven Oaks.
- What do you mean?
- Seven Oaks is notorious for its BO.
It was the last of the Select Seven to go coed.
An atmosphere of male barbarism predominates...
- ...but we're going to change that.
- Yes.
Where are you going?
Gotta get to the Housing Department.
They lost my rooming assignment.
That's terrible.
You have no place to stay?
Was it just mislaid?
No, there were more acceptances than they anticipated and not enough rooms to go around, so....
Why don't you stay with us?
Really?
Don't think of this in the old-fashioned sense of going to a party to find someone or not find someone.
That's not the dynamic that we're talking about.
- What dynamic are you talking about?
- Glad you asked.
Our going to a party of this kind is more a form of youth outreach.
- Of what?
- Youth outreach.
It's not just some moronic frat-house social function.
Though it will be that too.
We've gotta keep in mind that these guys are young people.
They're essentially immature and crying out for help and guidance.
- Though they don't know it.
- No, they don't, but we do.
- Aren't they the same age as we are?
- Only numerically.
I'm a lot fatter than you are, but I think we could pin it.
Oh, my gosh, that's beautiful.
Stunning.
Take Frank, my friend.
He's not some cool, handsome, studly macho type.
No, not at all.
I can't stand guys like that.
He's more of a sad sack really, wouldn't you say?
- Definitely.
- What is a sad sack?
A loser.
- You like losers?
- Very much so.
Do you know what's the major problem in social life?
What?
The tendency, widespread, to always seek someone cooler than yourself.
It's always a stretch.
Often a big stretch.
Why not find someone who's inferior?
- Someone like Frank.
- Yes.
It's more rewarding.
And, in fact, quite reassuring.
You mean someone you can help, not just thinking of yourself.
Yes, that's it, precisely.
But without the goody-goody implications.
Our aspirations are pretty basic.
Take a guy who hasn't realised his full potential or doesn't even have much and then help him realise it or find more.
There's enough material here for a lifetime of social work.
What's really worrisome is that that was intentional.
Frank.
Frank, this is Lily.
She's just come to Seven Oaks as a transfer student.
Isn't she great?
Lily failed or wasn't happy at her last school.
We're sure that she's going to adapt here.
- In fact, she already has.
- Oh, good.
Oh, my God.
A golden oldie.
I love these.
- Oh, my gosh.
Wasn't that great?
- That was really fun.
I know that people can have useful careers in many areas.
Medicine, government, law, finance.
- Education.
- Yes, even education.
But I'd like to do something especially significant in my lifetime.
That could change the course of human history.
- Such as starting a new dance craze.
- Really?
Yes.
Something that could improve the lives of every person and every couple.
I'm so proud of what you accomplished last night.
You showed those guys a really good time.
Without anything really bad happening.
That's good.
The guys you know, are they all Greeks?
- What?
- Are all the guys you know Greeks?
Excuse me.
I don't understand.
Are all the guys you know Greeks?
- I don't think we know any Greeks.
- Greeks, like frat boys.
Oh, yes.
Fraternities.
You mean members of the Greek-letter fraternities.
Yeah.
Like last night.
Actually, last night we were at the DU house.
DU.
Roman letters.
Not Greek.
Seven Oaks has never had a Greek-letter fraternity system.
It's always been a Roman-letter system here.
It's very different.
- What house is this?
- Oh, this isn't a fraternity.
At least not one anyone should want to join.
You probably think we're frivolous, empty-headed college coeds.
You're probably right.
I often feel empty-headed.
We're trying to make a difference in people's lives.
One way to do that is to stop them from killing themselves.
Have you ever heard of "Prevention is nine-tenths the cure"?
Well, in the case of suicide, it's actually 10-tenths the cure.
- Those are clichés, aren't they?
- Yes, they are.
It's interesting you say that.
I love clichés and hackneyed expressions.
- Do you know why?
- No.
Because they're largely true.
The hundreds, perhaps thousands of such clichés and hackneyed expressions that our language has bequeathed us are a stunning treasure trove of human insight and knowledge.
- Really?
- Yes.
Oh, please sit down.
During these formative college years we should learn as many clichéd and hackneyed thoughts as possible.
Furthermore, I think we will.
Speaking of suicide prevention, do you have a boyfriend, Lily?
- Are you dating anyone?
- I don't see the connection.
- You don't?
- Boyfriends are a primary suicide risk.
You don't have any particular friend?
No one at all?
No.
Well, there's this grad student I met over summer.
Xavier.
We became pretty good pals.
He has a girlfriend whom I've met.
She's very nice.
"Zavier." With a Z?
- No, I think it's with an X.
- No, I'm certain it's Z.
Zavier, like Zorro.
It's the same sound.
Zorro marked his name with a Z.
It's an X.
But Zorro's with a Z.
Okay, let me see if I can figure this out.
Used at the beginning of a name, Z and X have the same pronunciation.
- But it's Zorro with a Z.
- Actually, there were two Zorros.
One spelled his name with a Z and made a Z mark for Zorro.
And there's Xorro who spelled his name with an X and with his sword he'd make an X mark.
What was really unfair was because he marked his name with X everybody assumed he was illiterate when he was spelling correctly.
- Hello.
- Can we help you?
Of course we can.
No case is too challenging.
- Would you like a doughnut?
- Okay.
Please, sit down.
- Here, have some coffee.
- Thank you.
- What's your name?
- Jim Bose.
- But my friends call me Jimbo.
- Why?
- What?
- Why do your friends call you Jimbo?
Well, it's a contraction of Jim and the first part of my last name, Bose.
Yeah, I got that.
But why bother?
- What do you mean?
- Jim is already a lovely name.
It's short, simple, evocative.
Shouldn't a nickname simplify the name that it replaces?
Jimbo doesn't really simplify anything.
I don't know.
Well, maybe you should ask your friends.
Where do you live or reside?
Doar Dorm.
- Oh, my God.
Yuck.
- What?
- The smell, it's notorious.
- What smell?
You're right, it's more like a stink.
Unclean clothing, I'd say, mostly.
- Vomit.
- Stale beer.
Pot.
Cheap deodorant.
There might be a vermin infestation.
Did you know a good-smelling environment is crucial to our sense of well-being?
Have you tried to find a better-smelling place?
Wait, wait.
It's not me, I'm not depressed.
- You're not?
- No.
Are you sure?
You kind of seem on edge.
- No, I'm fine.
- That's a terrible expression. "Fine."
"I'm fine."
Something smug about it. "I'm fine."
- Why do you say that you're fine?
- I'm not depressed.
I'm not suicidal.
Why are you here, then?
Are you a con man?
- A confidence trickster?
- No, there's a girl.
Her boyfriend dumped her.
She was crying but now is silent.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you say so?
We have to go.
Call the cops!
A suicide might be in progress!
- The campus cops?
- Yes, of course the campus cops.
Take this.
We have a lot of students coming to the centre pretending to be depressed to get doughnuts.
- Confidence tricksters.
- Yes, it's really bad.
Really cynical.
We pledged to the doughnut company we would only give doughnuts to students who were depressed or otherwise nutty.
We're a nonprofit, so the rules are pretty strict.
- This man could still be a trickster.
- Well, we'll soon find out.
Tell me about this girl.
Well, her name is Priss.
She's very pretty.
Oh, yes.
It's very hard for beautiful women to experience rejection.
Priss?
Priss.
Are you okay?
Priss!
Priss, say something!
Priss!
Open up!
Oh, thank God.
We're gonna have to force this door.
Priss?
Are you okay?
- What?
- Please don't.
Please, come with us.
Do you wanna talk about it?
What was his name?
Josh.
If you'd rather not talk, we don't have to.
No, it's okay, I just....
I keep thinking how he used to gaze at me with such love in his eyes.
You know what I mean?
No.
No, I've never actually seen that.
Yes.
Just days ago, he'd gaze at me.
His eyes, so blue.
He had blue eyes?
So does Frank.
Frank's the guy that I go out with.
Otherwise, he's not conventionally good-looking, which I actually prefer.
Would you describe Josh as handsome?
- That's a problem.
- Could I join you guys?
Yes, please.
Priss and I were just talking.
In my view, handsome men are to be avoided.
I don't even consider good looks to be flattering in a man.
- Do you know what I mean?
- No.
Cookie-cutter, good-looking guys, with their chiselled features running around, full of themselves getting everything they want, never suffering or experiencing--
We suffered?
We're not under discussion.
That's irrelevant.
That's besides the point.
- Is this making you feel any better?
- Yes.
I think so.
Good.
I hoped it would.
Okay, it's nearly 4 and The Daily Complainer's orientation meeting is about to start and I think we should go.
The editor, Rick DeWolfe, he's terrible.
A real jerk.
Why do you think he's such a jerk?
He's one of those that I was talking about.
Tall.
Probably considers himself very smart and handsome.
A journalist, so you can imagine the mindboggling arrogance and conceit.
- But, Violet, don't you think--?
- What?
Well, don't you think that the way you talk could be considered arrogant too?
I mean, a little?
Yes, of course.
But what's your point?
Wouldn't that be hypocritical, criticising Rick for something you could be criticised for yourself?
No.
I don't see why.
We're all flawed.
Must that render us mute to the flaws of others?
Must we tether ourselves from comment because our natures are human too?
We've got a rebel amongst us.
That's good, I think.
It's good to be challenged and criticised.
I know your intentions are good, it's just--
That's it precisely.
Our intentions are good.
We're seeking to help people rescue their lives from terrible sadness and failure which is a worthy goal, don't you think?
Yes.
But not exactly a humble one.
No.
I agree with you there.
You're right, absolutely.
I'd like to thank you for this chastisement.
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to chastise.
- No, I think you did and I think it's good.
It's good to have a friend to put one in one's place when that's what one needs.
Now I see that I have that kind of friend in you.
I think that's great.
Hello, people.
Listen up.
People, quiet.
Quiet, people.
Shut up!
Okay, that's better.
I'm Rick DeWolfe, editor of The Complainer.
Over the next weeks, I'm the person you're gonna hate most in the world.
You're gonna hate me because I'm gonna work you point out your stupidity and incompetence and do everything in my power to turn you into journalists.
- Albeit barely literate ones.
- Oh, brother.
Any questions?
No?
Yes.
How did The Daily Complainer get its name?
Isn't that pretty obvious?
It comes out every day and it's the university daily.
So The Daily Complainer.
- The Daily--
- No, I meant--
Oh, you mean, why The Complainer?
The name dates from Seven Oaks' earliest days as a divinity school.
The reference is to the Book of Job.
Job's complaint with the world.
Before justice can be achieved, a complaint must be made.
That is what we do and people don't like it a bit.
Right now, what that means is extirpating Seven Oaks' elitist Roman Letter Clubs that are like a cancer on the community.
They're not elitist in the least.
Yes, they are.
Have you met any of their members?
The guys from the DU, for example?
They're barely competent for the tasks of everyday life.
They have to drink a quart of beer just to talk to a woman?
- Two quarts.
- Yet you salivate at the idea of taking the roof off their heads and throwing them on the street where who knows what would happen.
You call yourself a Christian.
- No, I don't.
- What unkindness and cruelty.
This is the darkness in the heart of man, which Joseph Conrad wrote about most eloquently.
- He was actually Polish.
- Oh, my God.
Unkind, self-righteous and pedantic.
In short, a model journalist.
You should know something about these girls.
They run the suicide centre where their preferred therapy for depressed and suicidal people is tap dancing.
- I kid you not.
- Tap is a highly effective therapy as well as a dazzlingly expressive dance form that has been sadly neglected for too many years.
It's moronic and barbaric.
You expect tap dancing to solve people's problems?
No, we don't.
We're using the whole range of musical dance numbers which have proven themselves to be effective therapies for the suicidal and the hopelessly depressed.
That really got me down.
- I thought you handled it well.
- You did?
Thanks.
No, it's all this aggression and hostility that gets me down.
Not just his but also my own.
It leaves you feeling unclean.
Have you thought of taking a shower?
Maybe you'd feel better.
You're probably right.
No, there's something else.
What Lily was saying about me being conceited and arrogant.
- I'm sorry.
- No, I think you're right.
I'm really ashamed.
- You're joking.
- No, it's terrible how I've acted.
We're all Christians.
Or I should say Judeo-Christians.
Humility should be our watchword.
The essence of being a good person.
Humility comes from within.
If it's not there in the first place, where do you go to get it?
I stopped looking a long time ago.
Very good, Freak.
- You really think so?
- Yes.
Certainly.
- Five, six, seven, eight.
- Violet.
Is it such a good idea to call him Freak?
What?
He's already depressed and you're calling him Freak.
That's his name.
Freak.
Freak Astaire.
That's how he wants to be called.
What are you talking about?
Lily was just saying she likes your dancing.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Are you okay?
What do you mean?
I thought you looked sad and was wondering...
- ...if there was anything we could do.
- What could you do?
Oh, I know.
You think I'm gonna kill myself and make you look bad.
No, I'm worried that you'll kill yourself and make yourself look bad.
Do you have any idea how demoralising it is to be constantly questioned about whether you're suicidal or not?
No.
After a while, you wonder, why is everyone asking me this?
They want me to be suicidal?
Or is it just the consequence of your utter absurdity?
Excuse me.
What scent are you wearing?
- What are you talking about?
- The perfume you're wearing.
I'm not wearing any perfume!
You see, that could be the problem.
- I've become friends with a group.
- Really?
- Although they're perfume-obsessed.
- Oh, them?
Those girls?
The ones who volunteer at the centre?
- Yeah.
- But they're terrible.
The blond one?
She's notorious.
- What do you mean?
- Such a bitch.
Terrible, isn't she?
- Would balsamic be okay?
- What?
Balsamic vinegar.
For the dressing.
Yeah, sure.
- What's that?
- What?
- Those.
- Artichokes?
Is that what they look like?
Come on, Lily.
You've seen an artichoke before.
- You haven't?
- They look so weird.
I'm not convinced that having a suicide-prevention centre prevents any suicides.
Well, the coffee's good.
If someone were determined to destroy themselves...
- ...
I don't think they'd stop for coffee.
- It depends on what it tastes like.
- Where are we going?
- I thought I'd take Priss over to DU.
Why?
It might be helpful for her to meet some of the guys.
How would that be helpful?
They're morons.
- Oh, come on, Lily.
- No, they're morons.
No.
Not medically.
I like them.
They're in that sympathetic range of being not good-looking and yet not smart.
There's something likeable about that.
Spending time with them, you get the sense that you're making a difference.
For somebody suicidal, like Priss, that could be a real boost.
- I'm not suicidal.
- Oh, that's good.
It's better not to have an identity as a suicidal person, don't you think?
- Well, bye.
- Well....
- Where are you going?
- Over to Xavier's.
- Is that a good idea?
- Why wouldn't it be?
- Is his girlfriend gonna be there?
- Of course.
- Gosh, you're nosy.
- No, no, it's just a general foreboding.
"Foreboding"?
You know, you're absolutely right.
I was being nosy.
Terribly so.
- I've gotta watch that.
- Yes, we must improve ourselves.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
Lily.
- You were coming over?
- Hey.
Yeah.
Is Alice home?
Alice is working.
- Oh, she is?
- But it's not a problem.
It's good you came.
Let's go to the Oak Bar.
I'll buy you a beer.
- I thought Alice would be back.
- I'll call her.
She'll join us there.
Come on.
Okay.
She's actually quite a good person.
Her entire identity revolves around helping people.
You really think that's true?
What's she have against The Complainer?
That's bizarre.
Well, she thinks the editor, Rick DeWolfe, is completely egotistical.
And your friend isn't?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi, Lily.
- Hi.
- Great.
You got the message.
- Yeah.
- Who's egotistical?
- Lily's roommate.
She sounds unbearable.
She's on a rampage against The Complainer.
Really?
Why?
She thinks the editor, Rick DeWolfe, is conceited.
- And, in fact, quite mean.
- Mean?
Yes.
He wants to close the Seven Oaks Roman Letter Clubs.
That's good, isn't it?
Everyone was against them.
- No.
- Come on.
There's no justification for those places.
They're exclusive and elitist.
The point that Violet makes is that they can't be elitist.
- They're morons.
- Yeah, elitist morons.
You'll grant they're morons.
That's a handicap.
Such people should be helped, not hounded and persecuted.
- Persecuted?
- Yes, losing the roof over your head?
That's the worst thing that can happen.
Violet thinks there could be some risk of suicide.
Because some boy might kill himself, Seven Oaks can't do what's right?
It's a factor to be considered.
- Yeah.
- No, it isn't.
You can't set policy that way.
- Excuse me, we didn't order these.
- Compliments of the guy at the bar.
That's a playboy or operator move.
Operators like that are to be avoided.
Why?
It seems generous, sending drinks to people you don't know.
- Drinks are expensive.
- Drinks to two gorgeous girls.
His intention was to seduce and he assumed he could.
- Both?
- That seems a bit harsh.
You don't know what he was thinking.
Was he alone?
Yes.
You see?
He was alone and probably lonely.
He could see that Alice and Lily were students.
Students are known for their intelligent conversation.
They can always talk about their courses.
That was probably what attracted him.
Nonsense.
Perhaps his view was even loftier.
To court Lily with a view to matrimony.
We're in the north, but a southern gentleman can wander into these parts.
Rubbish.
Seeing Lily across a crowded bar filled with the usual undergraduate slobs.
Why wouldn't a thoughtful young man seek her out?
She's lovely.
Isn't it incumbent on men and women to find ways to meet each other?
Buying drinks for a person you don't know seems to be a generous one.
Yes.
Most guys won't even pay for the women they do know.
What you've described is a playboy or operator move.
I'll grant you that it's a tactic or perhaps even a ruse but without some of that, would our species even survive?
The Lord said, "Be fruitful and multiply."
Oh, my gosh.
No, this is how the world works, seeing someone across a room.
This could be the romantic story you tell your grandchildren.
And if you do marry and have children then he'll really learn how to squander cash.
Isn't it good to know that he's basically generous from the start?
Where's Priss?
Your eyes are so striking.
So blue.
- Really?
They're blue?
- Yes.
The most piercing blue.
You must know your eyes are blue.
- No.
- What do you mean?
What?
You must know what colour your eyes are.
Your eyes are very blue.
You know that.
I'm not gonna go around checking what colour my eyes are.
When you look in the mirror, you see that your eyes are blue.
- Oh, come on.
- What?
I don't think my eyes have a colour.
If my eyes are so blue looking out, wouldn't everything be kind of blue?
Like, have a bluish tinge to it?
Doesn't.
Just looks normal.
That's...?
That's blue?
- That colour?
- Yes, of course.
Then what colour is that?
Green.
You're saying that chair's green but Frank's eyes are blue?
Yes.
Then what colour are the walls?
Also green.
You didn't know that?
No.
How's that possible?
You think knowing the colours is so important?
You're in college and you don't know the colours?
Doesn't that embarrass you?
Well, no.
Why should it?
That's why the 'rents are paying big bucks to send me here.
You know, to learn stuff.
Well, gotta go hit the books.
I don't think anyone should feel embarrassed about not knowing stuff.
What's embarrassing is pretending to know.
Or putting people down because you think they don't know as much.
Look, I'm happy to admit I'm completely ignorant.
That's why I'm here and plan to really hit the books.
So the next time you see me, I will know more than I do now.
I'll be older but also wiser.
Or at least know more stuff.
For me, that's education.
Cheers.
Thor's great.
He's very clear about his objectives.
He really wants to learn things.
Frank?
What a jerk.
- He's a monster.
- Oh, my gosh, Violet.
You did everything for them.
They're nothing without you.
- What a rat.
- He's a moron.
- Don't waste a tear on that creep.
- Don't waste a single breath.
- Jerk.
- Stop.
- Please.
- What?
I love Frank.
I love him.
Come on, Violet, Frank's a moron.
You are well rid of him.
- Don't say that.
- Frank's not a moron?
You know, Lily, you're a bit harsh.
This obsession with intelligence.
Do you think it has some magical quality transforming everything?
The intelligence line is not an immutable barrier.
Love can cross it.
You can love someone whose mental capacity is not large.
I know.
I have.
- Well, there's a mutable barrier, then.
- Frank's stupid, we knew.
That he's a rat playboy operator, I hadn't realised.
I don't want to turn bitter.
- I worry for Frank.
I care about him.
- Well, I'd stop.
No.
I love Frank.
I always will.
If that's the case, why not fight for him?
- Against Priss?
I'd never win.
- Sure you would.
Priss is a rat.
A bitch.
A rat bitch.
Don't blame Priss.
She was crushed when her blue-eyed Josh left her.
I should've known.
Of course she'd fall for Frank.
Josh and Frank are both blue-eyed heartbreakers.
Poor Violet.
She's the roommate who's so self-confident?
Yeah.
But now she's a wreck.
But there's no logic to the algebra of love.
"The algebra of love."
That sounds like the title to some lame book.
It's a title, but the book's not lame at all.
Love's algebra?
I thought it was more geometry.
Okay, the title's not good, but the book is.
What's it say?
Well, that while we're all perverse in our romantic preferences there's actually this logic or algebra to our perversity and it has something to do with how the species has evolved.
- The survival of the species?
- Yes.
And whether it will continue to do so.
No booze?
Just to find the nearest package store, you had to drive 40 miles.
- These aren't so strong.
- No, they're really strong.
I think I'd like another.
- That wouldn't be a good idea.
- Why not?
- Well....
- Are you trying to stifle me?
- Lily?
- Oh, hi.
Listen, we're gonna get something to eat.
Why don't you come with us?
- I'm with Charlie.
- I can see that.
- But you really should come.
- Why?
I just think it would be a good idea.
- But why?
- You really must come.
I insist.
Lily?
Lily?
Lily, are you angry?
Lily, this is it.
We're here.
What's the matter?
That was so rude.
He's a nice guy and you embarrassed him.
He's not nice.
He was trying to get you drunk.
- No, he wasn't.
- Plying you with martinis?
- I was plying myself with martinis.
- Come on, the guy's a total sleaze.
- A creep.
- You don't know anything about him.
The way he sent drinks over to our table?
Alice.
Alice, what's wrong?
I had no idea that Xavier could be so mean.
Sounds as if he was just trying to protect you.
This Charlie Walker sounds like an operator or playboy type.
No, he's not like that.
He's actually a really nice guy.
I thought he was a slick businessman.
No.
He dresses well, but he works in strategic development.
- What?
- Strategic development.
He works at SDA.
Strategic Development Associates.
- He's an associate there.
- What he is, is a strategic operator.
Violet, are you okay?
Hey, miss, rain's coming!
Better get back!
- Polly, have you seen Violet?
- No.
Is something wrong?
We're not sure.
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
- Violet!
- Violet!
Oh, my gosh, what happened?
I don't understand.
What were you doing?
How long were you gone for?
I'm sorry, I don't know.
I lost track of time.
But you feel better now?
Well, cleaner.
She'll say anything to get in the show.
- She'll want doughnuts.
- You don't have to be suicidal...
- ...to get doughnuts, just depressed.
- Clinically depressed.
From a clinic.
- Would you say you're depressed?
- I don't like the term.
- I prefer to say I'm in a tailspin.
- Oh, my God.
A tailspin?
She can't even say she's depressed.
She's gotta say something special.
Priss was honest.
She was depressed and she had a right to be in the show.
Now every silly tailspinner's trying to get in.
- The show is for everyone.
- No, it isn't, Freak.
To be in the centre's programmes, you have to be clinically depressed.
That means that you've been to a clinic and they've said that you're depressed.
Have you been to a clinic?
Have you been to a clinic?
Then you're not clinically depressed.
Violet.
Violet.
What is it?
Where are you going?
All I wanted was to make Frank happy.
I had all these plans.
Things we could've done together.
I never even got to tell him.
Hey!
Where all your boyfriends at?
Come on!
They don't wear bikinis.
They're ladies, they wear thongs.
I can't imagine where she could've gone.
Wherever she went, she should be back by now.
How did she seem when you last saw her?
Really sad about Frank.
- Still?
- Yeah.
How can someone so smart continue mooning over a dope like that?
People aren't exactly as you assume.
The Violet you know bears little resemblance to the girl I met in seventh grade.
- You met Violet in seventh grade?
- Well, her name wasn't Violet then.
What's your name?
You can tell us your name.
We won't bite.
What's your name?
Tell us.
Are you retarded?
Tell us your name.
Emily Tweeter.
- Tweeter?
Like a bird?
- That's ridiculous.
Tweeter?
Like a bird?
- Not an easy name to have at that age.
- Not at any age.
What was she like?
Timid.
Bookish.
Classic scholarship student.
Her parents were writers.
They didn't have a dime.
Finances were the least of her worries.
- What do you mean?
- Well, she was crazy.
I got stuck rooming with her on a trip when no one else would.
- It was awful.
- Did she smell bad?
No.
Obsessive cleanliness was part of her insanity.
- You were nice to her.
- No.
The idea of being nice to weird kids hadn't arrived.
- Why was she so unpopular?
- Well, she was very strange.
Constantly setting herself odd, repetitive tasks.
Tasks?
For example, on that trip she had with her a little square suitcase.
The idea came into her head she had to move it in a precise pattern over and over again and if she didn't execute this movement flawlessly 10 times she'd start over.
Another was to slide her hand across her forehead trying not to touch her hair or eyebrows on either side also repeating it 10 times.
Any niggling thought she'd touched the hair, she'd start over.
- My God, that is insane.
- Why would she do that?
She had the conviction that if she didn't complete these tasks her parents would die.
- Was she Catholic?
- No.
But what made the whole thing really sad was that her parents did die.
Oh, my God.
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
Violet!
Violet?
Violet!
Violet, where are you?
Something's wrong, isn't it, dear?
You mind my asking?
Well, I do mind a little.
- Excuse me, Your Highness.
- I'm sorry.
- It's just kind of awkward to talk about.
- No matter.
I hope you haven't come to get run over on the highway.
- What do you mean?
- Suicides.
They come down from the university.
Jump out in the road.
Get hit by the blind curve.
Hope you're not one of them.
Do I look like one of them?
I don't know.
Maybe.
Messy people, suicides.
Think only of themselves and their own deaths.
Not what comes after.
They leave quite a mess.
They don't stick around to clean it up.
So you're not one of those depressed students from the university?
I don't like the word "depressed." I prefer to say that I'm in a tailspin.
A tailspin?
- Does this tailspin involve a man?
- Yes, it does.
But I'm not as crazy as I was up till yesterday.
Apparently that's due to the salutary effect of scent on the human psyche.
Its importance is, I believe, almost incalculable.
At the motel, I happened to use this soap.
It was provided to me as a courtesy as one of the guests.
That an economical motel would provide such good soap is quite unusual.
- The scent is very precise.
- Really?
Tell me if it provokes any particular reaction in your psyche.
A state of mind.
I always knew she was unstable.
They're gonna have her photo at the registrar's.
Violet!
Violet!
You're back!
You're okay!
Not really.
Oh, my gosh, Violet, we were so worried.
Why didn't you tell us or leave a note?
I did leave a note.
Would that be a suicide note?
- I wouldn't leave without a note.
- Where did you go?
I took the train to Villafranca and checked into a motel there.
- The Motel 6?
- No, the Motel 4.
- It's even less expensive.
- The Motel 4 in Villafranca?
- My God, you really were suicidal.
- Why'd you go?
I had to do something.
And you really thought you were gonna find the answer in Villafranca?
I'm not sure what I expected, but I might have found it.
What?
Soap?
This scent and this soap is what gives me hope.
Hello?
Hello?
Is anyone here?
Hello?
Lily?
- Hello?
- Oh, my gosh.
I couldn't understand where everyone was.
Sorry, I just went out to get some things.
- Where's Alice?
- Gone.
What do you mean?
Left.
We broke up.
- But when you called, you said--
- I know, I'm sorry.
I thought it better to tell you in person.
Alice couldn't control her jealousy.
It completely overwhelmed her.
Really?
What was she jealous of?
Come on.
No, what?
You.
After a while, I just couldn't handle it.
Things became impossible.
She was jealous of me?
Of course.
Would it be okay if we watch a film?
Yes.
What would you like to see?
I thought maybe Truffaut's Baisers volés.
Stolen Kisses.
Do you know it?
No, is it new?
It's a classic of French New Wave cinema.
I think you'll like it.
- But it's in colour?
- Yeah.
- You don't know Truffaut?
- No.
Do you know Godard, À bout de souffle?
- Why was Alice so jealous?
- What do you think?
She was jealous because Lily's lovely.
I don't know.
They had a lot of problems.
Of course.
You wouldn't break up a happy couple.
- What's that?
- A note Frank left.
- Really?
Recently?
- No, when we were together.
Now that most correspondence is electronic it's rare to be left anything written by hand.
Frank can write by hand?
- What is it?
- It's not very important.
It's just all I have.
- What's it say?
- "Out for brewskis.
Back in a giff."
What's a "giff"?
One of those little motor scooters, isn't it?
I'm sure he meant to write "jiff" with a J. "Back in a jiff."
But he wrote "giff."
- Could Frank be dyslexic?
- No.
Dyslexics are intelligent.
- What's that?
- Frank's bean ball.
- He gave you his bean ball?
- Not exactly.
This is an extra.
He thought he'd leave it here just in case he lost his other one.
Gosh, Violet, you've really gotta stop thinking about Frank.
Why?
I don't wanna stop thinking about him.
Recently I had a thought that cheered me up a lot.
Life is like a long, flowing river and as a long, flowing river, some debris you never expect to see again is almost certain to reappear floating to the surface.
Frank and I may very well be together again one day.
Maybe it'll take years, but somewhere down the line he's very likely to pop up again, and I'll be there to catch him.
I don't think we've spoken about this.
What?
Have you been to the south of France?
To the walled city of Carcassonne?
- I've never been anywhere.
- But you've seen pictures of it.
No, I don't think so.
Oh, it's fascinating.
- I'd like to visit.
- You never studied the Cathars?
They were a religious movement very idealistic located mostly in the southwest of France that the Catholic Church repressed.
Oh, my God.
The Catholic Church is, like, always bad.
Ideas can't be killed as easily as people.
Especially such enlightened ones as the Cathars held.
In recent years, more and more people have returned to their beliefs.
So you're a Cathar?
Yes.
I aspire to be.
I'm trying to follow the path the Cathars marked out.
That's so impressive.
I can tell you we didn't have any Cathars back home.
I think you'd be surprised.
In the Cathar view the highest form of lovemaking avoids procreation entirely.
Sure.
Condoms, right?
Well, according to Cathar ideas sex with condoms is just a parody of the procreative act.
What do you mean?
The standard, cliché form of sexual intercourse is for the man to approach a woman from the front.
Cathar lovemaking, I think you'll find very fulfilling.
I'll be very careful, we'll go slowly.
It'll be a new experience but one which I think you'll find brings an inexpressible closeness.
Might your drinks-buying friend be around?
It would be great to get complimentary cocktails.
- Charlie?
No.
- Do you still see him at all?
- He calls from time to time.
- He does?
- Why don't you introduce us.
- Why should I introduce you?
Because you know him, and we don't.
So?
"So?"
"So" is probably the unkindest word in the English language.
I can't bear it.
I think it should be outlawed. "So."
You're crazy.
Come on, Lily, you have Xavier.
- You can't keep two guys for yourself.
- Guys do that all the time.
We're not guys, fortunately.
It's unconscionable for you not to bring him and introduce us.
Charlie is a friend.
He's a nice guy.
What do you mean?
I hate to think what'd happen if you got your claws into him.
That's outrageous.
We're perfectly nice.
We've met lots of pathetic guys and nothing bad's happened.
- Charlie's not pathetic.
- Well, all the better, then.
The Roman Holidays will be coming soon.
- What's that?
- A festival Roman Letter Clubs put on.
A kind of moron jamboree.
The Roman elements are the worship of Bacchus, Beerus and Blotto.
- It could've all been so uplifting.
- Charlie.
Hey, Charlie.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
- Have you the day off?
- Yeah.
This is my friend Charlie, whom I think I've mentioned.
And, Charlie, these are my roommates.
This is....
This is Rose.
And this is Heather.
And Violet.
Charlie works for Strategic Development Associates.
He's an associate there.
You work in strategic development?
- You've heard of it?
- Of course, yes.
My cousin Jay in Philadelphia works in strategic development.
Something business-related?
Mostly business, but any kind of organisation.
- Only businesses pay the big bucks.
- Nonprofits and government pay well.
That's how they keep from having profits by paying lots of money to companies like yours.
Excuse me, but aren't you in Professor Ryan's course at the Ed School?
No.
You're not in Professor Ryan's Flit Lit course?
No.
- Flit Lit?
- The dandy tradition in literature.
- I'm sure I've seen you there.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm not in any courses at the Ed School.
Good to meet you.
- It was great to see you.
- Bye.
God, Violet, what was that about?
That guy is definitely in Professor Ryan's class.
Not possible.
He has a fulltime job for Strategic Development Associates.
He never got his coffee.
- Why lie about something like that?
- He's lying.
I find that very attractive.
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna stop cutting Professor Ryan's class.
It can be argued that Firbank was too little disciplined too unserious in his unseriousness to create works of enduring value.
But as a liberating influence on later writers such as Waugh his importance should not be discounted.
It's not Firbank's work itself but the idea of his work that so helped later writers as Thomas Love Peacock did in the previous century.
I'm not gonna come anymore.
- What a waste of time.
- Charlie.
Charlie.
- Charlie?
- Charlie, you are taking the course.
Charlie?
Who's Charlie?
- Fred, what's going on?
- Fred?
Fred. sounds like you got some explaining to do.
- Well, you were lying.
- I wasn't lying, I was making it up.
Why were you making it up?
If you were an eighth-year Ed School student, would you advertise that?
Eighth year.
Impressive.
But your whole life was a lie.
Dressing up in suits.
Buying people drinks.
The suits were real.
The drinks, real.
Not just drinks for people.
They were for cute girls.
There's a perfectly rational, easily explainable agenda.
So it was a playboy or operator move.
- Of course.
Transparently so.
- I admire that.
Drinks are expensive.
But strategic development, that was made up too?
- You said your cousin Jay was in it.
- What cousin Jay?
- In Philadelphia.
- I don't have a cousin in Philadelphia.
You said your cousin Jay was working in strategic development.
I was just saying that to be friendly.
To make a kind of link.
- So your name's Fred something?
- Yes.
Fred something.
- Packenstacker?
- Oh, my God.
How crazy.
He's completely insane.
I almost dated him.
- You can say that about a lot of guys.
- I don't think he's crazy.
Making up an entirely fictitious identity, that's not crazy?
- It's insane.
It's psycho.
- Violet's identity is made up.
- I don't think she's crazy.
- No, I am.
No, this is different.
It's crazy and pathetic.
All that about strategic development he just made up.
Don't tell me that's not weird.
I've heard of strategic development.
I think it's something pretty important.
Violet, you're not gonna start going out with him.
You're not, are you?
Well, we had planned to go to the library.
- Not to the stacks, I hope.
- Yes.
Oh, my gosh, do you realise how dangerous that is?
- Dangerous?
- Yes, the stacks.
They're dark and deserted.
Anything could happen.
It's true.
With the study habits at Seven Oaks your body won't be found until spring.
Promise you won't go with him to the stacks.
Please.
Okay.
I'll suggest the Randall Room.
- Don't suggest.
Insist.
- And please not at night.
Okay.
What are you reading?
Have you chosen a topic for your final paper?
The decline of decadence.
You think that decadence has declined?
Definitely.
Bigtime.
Major, major decline.
How?
How or in what ways?
Either.
Well, take the flit movement in literature, or homosexuality.
It's gone completely downhill, right down the tubes.
What do you mean?
Before, homosexuality was something refined, hidden aspiring to the highest levels of creativity and often achieving it.
Now it seems to be musclebound morons running around in T-shirts.
It's pretty disillusioning.
Are you gay?
Not especially, but in another era, it might have had some appeal.
- Now I just don't see the point.
- You might be romanticising the past.
We'll never know.
The past is gone, so we might as well romanticise it.
You could be right.
I wanted to ask, how's Lily?
Lily.
She's okay.
Here, check it out.
A.L.A. Nope.
Hello.
Good afternoon.
Check it out.
The A.L.A. Heard of it?
We have a meeting on Tuesday.
- You should come by.
- What is the A.L.A.?
Just join us.
Come Tuesday.
I think you'll really like it.
So....
A fellow was passing these out, and invited us to a meeting on Tuesday.
The A.L.A.?
Oh, my God.
I thought it was something related.
No?
The A.L.A. has got nothing to do with us.
Can't you see that?
The way we express love has meaning.
It's in the context of something beautiful.
We're following our creator's teaching.
Aspiring to an ideal.
A beautiful one that brings an inexpressible closeness.
Not just to each other, but....
For the A.L.A., and those like them the love act is just hedonistic pleasure-seeking of a perverted nature.
I can't believe you'd think we had anything in common with them.
We don't.
Nothing, not an iota.
My God, can't you see that?
Lily.
Lily, come back.
Please.
Don't be that way.
- Oh, my gosh, Lily.
Are you okay?
- It's all right.
You don't wanna talk about it?
I don't understand.
- You don't understand what?
- What is non-procreative lovemaking?
- It could be a lot of things.
- Yeah, but in this case?
- We don't have to talk about this.
- I don't mind.
Could somebody explain what this is about?
Well, if--
Cathars don't believe in procreative sex.
They don't have intercourse the usual way.
The usual way?
- You don't have to talk about this.
- No, it's okay.
It's the normal way, from the front where you can have procreation not from the other side, where you can't.
The other side?
That's their religion?
No, but it's the direction their beliefs head in.
When they express love, that's what they do.
How horrible.
You poor girl.
What?
That's terrible what he obliged Lily to do.
Violet.
Can we talk?
You must be pretty mad at me.
No.
You're not?
Not really.
But it was so terrible how everything happened.
Your walking in on us.
Maybe it's easier that way.
That bitch!
I can't believe it.
What a bitch.
- Priss?
- Of course Priss.
"I'm so stressed.
Sad.
Depressed.
I'm so tired.
I'm fatigued."
She was so depressed she had to get everything her own way.
"I'm so stressed.
Frantic."
Man.
What a bitch.
Priss dumped you?
No.
It was mutual.
Oh, listen, I have a question.
You remember that bean ball that I left in your room?
Yeah.
Do you still have it?
Yeah.
Do you think I could get it back?
I lost the other one, and with everything that's happened I'd really like to have it.
Nothing like some bean ball after a breakup.
Yeah.
God, you're smart.
You always get it.
Whatever I say you understand.
Man.
Hey, Heather.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Violet.
Violet, what's wrong?
I'm sorry.
Lily's lovely.
Now she's free.
Go.
I understand.
Latin!
Et cetera!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
This is what comes from not teaching Latin in the schools.
Yeah, it's moronic and boorish, but it's also kind of fun, don't you think?
No.
What's that stench?
I suppose this is what happens when decadence rots society from within.
And from without.
Such a society is, I fear destined to fail and be overrun.
Maybe that's good.
Finally.
It's about time those cesspools were drained.
What colour would you say that chair is?
That's a chair?
I have no idea.
- Guys have preferences.
- You're going to accept that?
- You're not going to do anything?
- There's nothing to be done.
- Fred must know his own mind.
- Oh, really?
- I seriously doubt that.
- Come on.
Lily's got that slender, delicately swelling beauty...
- ...that no man can resist.
- Okay, you're probably right.
Poor Lily.
Just think of all Xavier put her through.
He just used her body.
And not even the right side.
Have you noticed that good people tend to have large posteriors?
Not everyone, by any means.
I know it's not logical.
But it does seem to be true.
The genetic link between morality and large posteriors?
Yes, I think that's well known.
You and Violet have that build.
It's nice.
You're still very attractive, but also sensible and moralistic.
I don't.
I have narrow hips, but also no very strong principles.
Yes?
Oh, hi.
- Hi, Frank.
- Hey, Heather.
So I guess you guys all heard.
University's closing all the Roman Letter Houses.
Sorry.
This year's Roman Holidays did seem like the end of civilisation but when civilisation ends people are going to need a place to stay.
Man.
It's bad.
It's that bastard from The Complainer.
Someone from the administration's been reading it.
Hard to believe.
Bastard.
Listen we were wondering if you thought it would be okay if we stayed at the suicide centre.
Okay, sure.
That sounds like a good stopgap measure.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So there's one more thing.
Remember that bean ball we talked about?
Yes.
You think I could pick that up?
Just after everything that's happened, it--
I could really use it right now.
Yes.
- What's that?
- What?
The note.
One gets so few things written by hand anymore, I guess I kept it.
"Out for brewskis, back in a giff."
What's a giff?
It's the scooter.
Like a Vespa, right?
- That's what I thought.
- I was thinking about getting one.
You must've meant "jiff." "Back in a jiff."
And then misspelled it, or spelled it in a nonstandard way.
Yeah.
Not a good speller.
Thanks.
You're great.
Priss was such a bitch.
Damn.
Damn.
Hey, Heather.
Bye.
Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Heather is really cute.
She going out with anyone?
There might be something between her and Thor.
Thor?
Damn.
Heather and Thor?
Damn.
I'm worried about Thor.
It's hard for us to imagine how upsetting it is not knowing the colours.
It's impossible for me to imagine.
When Thor sees a rainbow, it's so much gibberish to him.
There was one this afternoon.
Oh, my gosh, he took it hard.
Recently, there was a parade in the city where the marchers carried rainbow-coloured flags and banners.
Thor was so upset.
He had no idea what it meant.
What kind of retard is he?
See, that's the conclusion people jump to.
- Well, it is somewhat understandable.
- Not if you knew the full story.
What's the full story?
You know how parents love bragging about how precocious their children are?
Thor's parents had become precocity addicts constantly needing an ever-greater precocity fix.
He should've entered kindergarten.
They pushed him into first grade.
"Thor skipped a grade," they could tell.
What Thor's parents failed to consider is the work done in nursery school.
Key being the study of colours.
I suppose they just assumed that colours are knowledge people pick up.
Like, for example, not stepping on sidewalk cracks.
What's that?
I think Rose is sleeping.
Am I boring?
No, not at all.
When you have problems, it's great to hear someone else's idiotic ones.
Please go on.
- What?
- What you said about depressed people being mean, you weren't joking.
I'm sorry, you're right.
Please go on.
No.
I'm sorry.
You know how I am.
Please continue.
Thor decided he absolutely had to learn all the colours.
Both primary and mixed.
He's been hitting the books hard, and thought he'd mastered them.
Then, in town, he said, "That traffic light's blue."
I had to say, "No, it's green."
He was really upset.
Oh, hi, Lily.
Hi.
We were worried about you.
I can't bear this tension with Lily.
It's terrible to have the group divided this way.
Better not next to Robertson.
What?
Didn't you hear?
Ed students have been going up to the roof and throwing themselves off.
- But it's only two storeys.
- Yes, I know.
It's terrible.
Not high enough to kill, but high enough to maim.
And particularly dangerous for anyone below.
I've got to forget about Fred.
But you really liked him.
This whole thing of a person meeting someone else first, it's so arbitrary.
- It's terrible and cruel.
- I have to say, I was wrong about Fred.
I thought he was a playboy or operator type.
In fact, he's just another guy rendered helpless...
- ...by the attentions of a pretty girl.
- Cary!
No, don't!
I love you!
- Why did you do that?
- Oh, my God!
Cary, I love you!
Isn't the Ed School essentially a teacher's college?
Yeah.
If they can't even destroy themselves how are they going to teach America's youth?
- What do you think you're doing?
- Sorry.
Did I disturb you?
Why are you wearing tap shoes?
You out of your mind?
- I think that's pretty clear.
- I'm so sick of that.
Oh, really?
I think it's cute.
Since you won't be treating us to one of your incompetent tap routines...
- ...why don't you take those things off?
- No.
We'll do the routine.
Rose.
- Madge wants to see the routine.
- I don't want to see your routine.
- I asked you to take those off.
- We need a break.
Just briefly, please.
It's helpful to have an audience.
Rose, the music.
I'm gonna report you.
Suzanne.
For me, it'd be Madame Curie, Simone de Beauvoir...
- ...and Margaret Sanger.
- Good.
Violet.
I would say Richard Strauss, Roderick Charleston and Chubbard Checker.
- Richard Strauss?
The composer?
- Yes, that was one of his posts.
I'm not familiar with the others.
Could you tell us who they are?
Yes.
Each one of these men started an international dance craze.
Richard Strauss, the waltz.
Roderick Charleston, the Charleston.
Chubbard Checker, known as Chubby the dance we know as the twist.
Why do you consider a dance craze important?
Dance crazes enhance and elevate the human experience bringing together millions of people in a joyous celebration of our God-given faculties and passing these modes of physical expression down through the generations.
Though not so much anymore.
I thought-- Well, I assumed that the Charleston was named after the city of Charleston.
No.
Though that misconception is quite widely held.
It was Roderick Charleston.
Usually, behind some great creative phenomenon there's a person, not a town.
This is so exciting.
It's really great, isn't it?
- Hey, could you guys help?
- Sure.
What's up?
We need help packing soap which we'll distribute to Doar Dorm residents.
Cool.
What would you say are effective means to fight depression?
Maybe some of your DU brothers have an idea?
- Beer?
- No.
Beer's a downer.
Cocktails.
Hard liquor and spirits is what really gives you a lift.
It's interesting what you say.
My cousin Jay is a medical officer in Philadelphia.
He says that alcoholism by which I mean chronic, excessive consumption of alcohol is the primary self-administered treatment for depression.
- Cool.
- No.
It leaves you much worse off than before.
Oh, no, not me.
I just boot and then I feel fine.
- By "boot" do you mean vomit?
- Yes.
No.
None of the effective anti-suicide treatments involve vomiting.
- Hygiene?
- Exactly.
It's very important.
That's why we have such hope in the wonder bar.
Do you know its scent?
Transformative, we think.
This is so exciting.
When should we go over there?
- I don't think there's any rush.
- I'd like to go soon.
Doar Dorm has the highest fatality rate, as well as the worst hygiene.
Highest suicide rate.
Fatality rate.
It's uncertain what percentage were intentional and how many were just due to unawareness of gravity's laws.
I can just see those guys getting the gold packages, opening them and finding the good-smelling soap inside.
The cute packaging should prove irresistible.
And once clean, they'll start to see the world with new eyes.
The change could be dramatic.
Doar Dorm could soon become Dior Dorm.
I doubt that, to be perfectly, absolutely honest.
I love the idea.
Dior Dorm.
I adore optimism, even when it's completely absurd.
- Perhaps especially then.
- Great.
Ready?
Let's go.
Let's hurry.
Let's not get our hopes up too high, Heather.
No, you said yourself, the wonder bar is transformative.
- Hey, Violet.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Where you going?
- Doar Dorm.
- Fred, hi.
- Hey.
Good one.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
I guess it wasn't realistic to expect Doar Dorm to turn into Dior Dorm overnight.
They wouldn't even open them.
They said without the soap, the discs wouldn't fly properly.
Are you coming Friday?
Violet's launching her dance craze.
Oh, really?
That's great.
- What's the dance?
- The Sambola.
The devil's dance.
- Oh, cool.
We'll go, right?
- Yes, I'd like to.
But I have several papers to finish.
But I'd like to.
Great.
Thanks, Gus.
I don't see how we're going to start a dance craze if no guys show up.
Most guys aren't very good with the dance-craze thing.
Very good news.
I was just in my procrastination seminar and the two guys from Doar Dorm had showered.
It was clear they'd used soap.
Oh, my gosh, what a difference.
Seems they'd been throwing packages so energetically, a soap bar fell out.
The unfamiliar ivory-like object intrigued them and one thing led to another, and, well....
It was just as you said.
Isn't that great?
- Oh, look, here's Jimbo.
- Jimbo doesn't count.
Where is everybody?
Aren't we gonna be late for Violet's dance craze?
You wanna go to that?
Yeah.
- You're kidding.
- No, I love dance crazes.
Gosh, you're strange.
But aren't we already late?
No, it's later on.
Like 10, I think.
I have to confess, I've started losing patience with Violet.
Depression calls for serious treatment.
Medication.
Psychopharmaceuticals.
Talk therapy.
Are those approaches effective?
Despite the medication and therapy Ed School students are still throwing themselves off Robertson Hall.
Violet's ideas might seem a little offbeat--
A little?
Oh, my God.
I don't know how much you know about Violet but there's some pretty weird stuff.
You know, Violet.
Violet Wister.
It's not even her real name.
- It isn't?
- No, it's Emily Tweeter.
When she was 11, she went completely crazy and has had several relapses since.
So it's a little worrisome to have her counsel nearly suicidal individuals.
I can't believe it.
- What?
- Emily Tweeter.
In first grade, I had an enormous crush on a girl with that name.
- And you remember that?
- Yeah.
Pretty huge Dr. Zhivago stuff.
Any idea or even mention of her filled me with emotion.
I had a strange perspective on the world.
I don't think my brain was functioning properly.
Everything was a bit of a dream.
You think this was Violet?
You have any idea if Violet attended Willamette Montessori?
In Portland?
- We didn't order these.
- Compliments of the guy at the bar.
It was so brutal how it ended between us.
I know I was too angry and a bit crazy but I thought that what we had was stronger than that.
That you would not just walk away after one disagreement.
It wasn't just that.
You mean my Cathar beliefs.
Well I am no longer a Cathar.
How is that possible?
It's been very difficult.
You've dropped your adherence to the Cathar faith?
- Yes, I have.
- Good.
Normally I'd be reluctant to comment on anyone's religion, but....
What?
I'm sorry.
I guess-- I guess I'm a bit of a bigot.
I just--
I could never take seriously any religion that worships on Tuesdays.
Major religions require worship on the weekend.
Friday, Saturday or Sunday.
I find it just really laudatory that people sacrifice their weekend time to worship God.
Having the Sabbath on Tuesday always seemed very bizarre to me.
It's not right.
You know what?
We'd better get to the Lone Star.
Why are you so concerned about that?
Well, it's not as if international dance crazes start every day.
We'd better hurry.
What's wrong?
Another fiasco.
Sometimes our struggle reminds me of the myth of Sisyphus.
- Who?
- The myth about the guy who pushes an enormous rock only to have it keep rolling back.
Oh, yeah.
What a knucklehead.
The important thing to remember is that he was mythical.
He never really existed.
Violet?
Did you spend any part of your education at Willamette Montessori?
In Oregon?
Why?
Sound like "tweaker."
Would you say today is very grey?
I'd say so.
Maybe blue-grey.
Yeah, no, that rings a bell now.
Bye.
I'm sorry.
Her name wasn't Emily Tweeter, but Lucy Wurlitzer.
They're not similar.
I'm beginning to realise that the human memory is not the foolproof instrument we sometimes imagine.
What's worse, everyone knew about my obsession, including my parents those from whom I most wanted it kept.
So from your earliest years, you were already a playboy or operator type?
Yes.
I suppose that's why secrecy seemed so desirable.
Violet, can we talk?
- What's the plural of doofus?
- Doufi.
Not doofuses?
You can say either.
"Doufi" respects the Latin root and is preferred.
"Doofuses" is also correct, although a bit inelegant.
- You've thought a lot about this.
- Yes, I've had to.
Why?
What is it?
I like Fred, he's a nice guy.
And I can see why you like him.
When I first met you and Rose, I thought you were the cool crowd.
And in many ways you are.
I find your perfume and fashion sense excellent.
Thank you.
But there's a reason, I think why you are so strongly attracted to doufi.
And it's not an accident how different groups divide up.
Isn't that a rainbow?
- That's a rainbow!
- Thor.
No, Thor!
Thor, no!
Stop!
Please, stop!
He's headed for Robertson Hall!
Red.
Orange.
Yellow.
Green.
Blue.
Indigo.
Hallelujah!
Lord God, thank you.
Education.
Education.
We can learn the subjects we set out to master no matter how hard or impossible they may seem.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I wasn't sure I was gonna make it.
Magenta.
Pink.
Gold.
I miss my nice American friend.
No, you're mistaken.
- You go to London for four weeks?
- Six.
It's dangerous, parents letting children travel.
They send them off and they don't know what they'll be getting back.
I don't know what you're referring to.
You're not from London.
I'm from London.
I was there, now I'm here.
I'm from London.
I just miss my nice American friend.
Nice?
Nice?
Fine.
I'm fine.
Those are not adjectives I like to use.
God gave us abilities.
He requires that we use them.
Good, better, best, excelsior, higher.
Only excellence can glorify the Lord.
Vulgarity is, in essence, blasphemous.
I'm sorry for what I was saying before.
Of course you're not linked to the doufi or even that such distinctions are valid.
No, don't apologise.
I probably do have a doufi orientation.
But behind coolness, isn't there a certain repressing squashing down, or lack of cultivation of one's humanity?
Oh, so you think that cool people have less humanity?
No, I don't think cool people are entirely inhuman.
Just enough to be cool.
In our society, there's all this propaganda in favour of uniqueness, eccentricity, et cetera.
But does the world really want or need more of such traits?
Aren't such people usually terrible pains in the neck?
What the world needs to work properly is a large mass of normal people.
I would like to be one of those.
Sorry.
But you'll still do the part?
Yeah, of course.
So do you know every number...
- ...in every Fred Astaire movie?
- There were two in our school musical.
- I know those.
- Did performing those two numbers help you overcome feelings of discouragement and despair?
Absolutely.
Freak.
Hey, everybody, let's do the Sambola.

- Look.
- Where?
There.
Yes. I think so.
Hello.
Are you a new student?
- Yes.
- Good.
We thought so.
We'd like to help you.
Help me?
What do you mean?
As a freshman, it can be very tough.
You get to college and it's supposed to be great, but it's not.
University life can be pretty bad.
- There are a lot of suicides.
- Well, attempted ones.
I'm not actually a freshman.
I'm a transfer student.
- Oh, an entering sophomore?
- Yes.
You were unhappy and are looking to recover here.
- Well, I think you will.
- Yes.
Would you welcome that?
Would our help be something you'd appreciate?
Or would you rather sink or swim on your own?
- Either way is fine.
We'll be friends.
- Yes, whichever you'd prefer.
Yes.
Sure.
Great.
We should start immediately.
Clothes can be crucial for confidence and an overall sense of well-being.
- Clothes don't have to be expensive.
- You need friends of the same size.
- You don't like my clothes?
- l'm just saying.
Move it out.
What?
What's wrong?
- What's wrong?
- You didn't notice that?
- No.
What?
- Those guys.
That smell.
That awful, acrid odor.
Have you heard of nasal shock syndrome?
Any harsh, acrid or just disgusting odor sends Rose into nasal shock.
Just from some BO?
"Just some BO"?
Oh, my God, Lily.
You must have a very high threshold for pain.
That'll serve you well at Seven Oaks.
- What do you mean?
- Seven Oaks is notorious for its BO.
It was the last of the Select Seven to go coed.
An atmosphere of male barbarism predominates...
- ...but we're going to change that.
- Yes.
Where are you going?
Gotta get to the Housing Department.
They lost my rooming assignment.
That's terrible.
You have no place to stay?
Was it just mislaid?
No, there were more acceptances than they anticipated and not enough rooms to go around, so....
Why don't you stay with us?
Really?
Don't think of this in the old-fashioned sense of going to a party to find someone or not find someone.
That's not the dynamic that we're talking about.
- What dynamic are you talking about?
- Glad you asked.
Our going to a party of this kind is more a form of youth outreach.
- Of what?
- Youth outreach.
It's not just some moronic frat-house social function.
Though it will be that too.
We've gotta keep in mind that these guys are young people.
They're essentially immature and crying out for help and guidance.
- Though they don't know it.
- No, they don't, but we do.
- Aren't they the same age as we are?
- Only numerically.
I'm a lot fatter than you are, but I think we could pin it.
Oh, my gosh, that's beautiful.
Stunning.
Take Frank, my friend.
He's not some cool, handsome, studly macho type.
No, not at all.
I can't stand guys like that.
He's more of a sad sack really, wouldn't you say?
- Definitely.
- What is a sad sack?
A loser.
- You like losers?
- Very much so.
Do you know what's the major problem in social life?
What?
The tendency, widespread, to always seek someone cooler than yourself.
It's always a stretch.
Often a big stretch.
Why not find someone who's inferior?
- Someone like Frank.
- Yes. lt's more rewarding.
And, in fact, quite reassuring.
You mean someone you can help, not just thinking of yourself.
Yes, that's it, precisely.
But without the goody-goody implications.
Our aspirations are pretty basic.
Take a guy who hasn't realized his full potential or doesn't even have much and then help him realize it or find more.
There's enough material here for a lifetime of social work.
What's really worrisome is that that was intentional.
Frank.
Frank, this is Lily.
She's just come to Seven Oaks as a transfer student. lsn't she great?
Lily failed or wasn't happy at her last school.
We're sure that she's going to adapt here.
- ln fact, she already has.
- Oh, good.
Oh, my God.
A golden oldie.
I love these.
- Oh, my gosh.
Wasn't that great?
- That was really fun.
I know that people can have useful careers in many areas.
Medicine, government, law, finance.
- Education.
- Yes, even education.
But I'd like to do something especially significant in my lifetime.
That could change the course of human history.
- Such as starting a new dance craze.
- Really?
Yes.
Something that could improve the lives of every person and every couple.
I'm so proud of what you accomplished last night.
You showed those guys a really good time.
Without anything really bad happening.
That's good.
The guys you know, are they all Greeks?
- What?
- Are all the guys you know Greeks?
Excuse me. I don't understand.
Are all the guys you know Greeks?
- l don't think we know any Greeks.
- Greeks, like frat boys.
Oh, yes.
Fraternities.
You mean members of the Greek-letter fraternities.
Yeah.
Like last night.
Actually, last night we were at the DU house.
DU.
Roman letters.
Not Greek.
Seven Oaks has never had a Greek-letter fraternity system.
It's always been a Roman-letter system here.
It's very different.
- What house is this?
- Oh, this isn't a fraternity.
At least not one anyone should want to join.
You probably think we're frivolous, empty-headed college coeds.
You're probably right.
I often feel empty-headed.
We're trying to make a difference in people's lives.
One way to do that is to stop them from killing themselves.
Have you ever heard of "Prevention is nine-tenths the cure"?
Well, in the case of suicide, it's actually 1 0-tenths the cure.
- Those are clichés, aren't they?
- Yes, they are.
It's interesting you say that. I love clichés and hackneyed expressions.
- Do you know why?
- No.
Because they're largely true.
The hundreds, perhaps thousands of such clichés and hackneyed expressions that our language has bequeathed us are a stunning treasure trove of human insight and knowledge.
- Really?
- Yes.
Oh, please sit down.
During these formative college years we should learn as many clichéd and hackneyed thoughts as possible.
Furthermore, I think we will.
Speaking of suicide prevention, do you have a boyfriend, Lily?
- Are you dating anyone?
- l don't see the connection.
- You don't?
- Boyfriends are a primary suicide risk.
You don't have any particular friend?
No one at all?
No.
Well, there's this grad student I met over summer.
Xavier.
We became pretty good pals.
He has a girlfriend whom I've met.
She's very nice.
"Zavier." With a Z?
- No, I think it's with an X.
- No, I'm certain it's Z.
Zavier, like Zorro.
It's the same sound.
Zorro marked his name with a Z.
It's an X.
But Zorro's with a Z.
Okay, let me see if I can figure this out.
Used at the beginning of a name, Z and X have the same pronunciation.
- But it's Zorro with a Z.
- Actually, there were two Zorros.
One spelled his name with a Z and made a Z mark for Zorro.
And there's Xorro who spelled his name with an X and with his sword he'd make an X mark.
What was really unfair was because he marked his name with X everybody assumed he was illiterate when he was spelling correctly.
- Hello.
- Can we help you?
Of course we can.
No case is too challenging.
- Would you like a doughnut?
- Okay.
Please, sit down.
- Here, have some coffee.
- Thank you.
- What's your name?
- Jim Bose.
- But my friends call me Jimbo.
- Why?
- What?
- Why do your friends call you Jimbo?
Well, it's a contraction of Jim and the first part of my last name, Bose.
Yeah, I got that.
But why bother?
- What do you mean?
- Jim is already a lovely name.
It's short, simple, evocative.
Shouldn't a nickname simplify the name that it replaces?
Jimbo doesn't really simplify anything.
I don't know.
Well, maybe you should ask your friends.
Where do you live or reside?
Doar Dorm.
- Oh, my God.
Yuck.
- What?
- The smell, it's notorious.
- What smell?
You're right, it's more like a stink.
Unclean clothing, I'd say, mostly.
- Vomit.
- Stale beer.
Pot.
Cheap deodorant.
There might be a vermin infestation.
Did you know a good-smelling environment is crucial to our sense of well-being?
Have you tried to find a better-smelling place?
Wait, wait.
It's not me, I'm not depressed.
- You're not?
- No.
Are you sure?
You kind of seem on edge.
- No, I'm fine.
- That's a terrible expression. "Fine."
"l'm fine."
Something smug about it. "l'm fine."
- Why do you say that you're fine?
- l'm not depressed. I'm not suicidal.
Why are you here, then?
Are you a con man?
- A confidence trickster?
- No, there's a girl.
Her boyfriend dumped her.
She was crying but now is silent.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you say so?
We have to go.
Call the cops!
A suicide might be in progress!
- The campus cops?
- Yes, of course the campus cops.
Take this.
We have a lot of students coming to the center pretending to be depressed to get doughnuts.
- Confidence tricksters.
- Yes, it's really bad.
Really cynical.
We pledged to the doughnut company we would only give doughnuts to students who were depressed or otherwise nutty.
We're a nonprofit, so the rules are pretty strict.
- This man could still be a trickster.
- Well, we'll soon find out.
Tell me about this girl.
Well, her name is Priss.
She's very pretty.
Oh, yes. lt's very hard for beautiful women to experience rejection.
Priss?
Priss.
Are you okay?
Priss!
Priss, say something!
Priss!
Open up!
Oh, thank God.
We're gonna have to force this door.
Priss?
Are you okay?
- What?
- Please don't.
Please, come with us.
Do you wanna talk about it?
What was his name?
Josh.
If you'd rather not talk, we don't have to.
No, it's okay, I just....
l keep thinking how he used to gaze at me with such love in his eyes.
You know what I mean?
No.
No, I've never actually seen that.
Yes.
Just days ago, he'd gaze at me.
His eyes, so blue.
He had blue eyes?
So does Frank.
Frank's the guy that I go out with.
Otherwise, he's not conventionally good-looking, which I actually prefer.
Would you describe Josh as handsome?
- That's a problem.
- Could I join you guys?
Yes, please.
Priss and I were just talking.
In my view, handsome men are to be avoided.
I don't even consider good looks to be flattering in a man.
- Do you know what I mean?
- No.
Cookie-cutter, good-looking guys, with their chiseled features running around, full of themselves getting everything they want, never suffering or experiencing--
We suffered?
We're not under discussion.
That's irrelevant.
That's besides the point.
- ls this making you feel any better?
- Yes. I think so.
Good. I hoped it would.
Okay, it's nearly 4 and The Daily Complainer's orientation meeting is about to start and I think we should go.
The editor, Rick DeWolfe, he's terrible.
A real jerk.
Why do you think he's such a jerk?
He's one of those that I was talking about.
Tall.
Probably considers himself very smart and handsome.
A journalist, so you can imagine the mindboggling arrogance and conceit.
- But, Violet, don't you think--?
- What?
Well, don't you think that the way you talk could be considered arrogant too?
I mean, a little?
Yes, of course.
But what's your point?
Wouldn't that be hypocritical, criticizing Rick for something you could be criticized for yourself?
No. I don't see why.
We're all flawed.
Must that render us mute to the flaws of others?
Must we tether ourselves from comment because our natures are human too?
We've got a rebel amongst us.
That's good, I think. lt's good to be challenged and criticized.
I know your intentions are good, it's just--
That's it precisely.
Our intentions are good.
We're seeking to help people rescue their lives from terrible sadness and failure which is a worthy goal, don't you think?
Yes.
But not exactly a humble one.
No.
I agree with you there.
You're right, absolutely.
I'd like to thank you for this chastisement.
- l'm sorry, I didn't mean to chastise.
- No, I think you did and I think it's good.
It's good to have a friend to put one in one's place when that's what one needs.
Now I see that I have that kind of friend in you.
I think that's great.
Hello, people.
Listen up.
People, quiet.
Quiet, people.
Shut up!
Okay, that's better. I'm Rick DeWolfe, editor of The Complainer.
Over the next weeks, I'm the person you're gonna hate most in the world.
You're gonna hate me because I'm gonna work you point out your stupidity and incompetence and do everything in my power to turn you into journalists.
- Albeit barely literate ones.
- Oh, brother.
Any questions?
No?
Yes.
How did The Daily Complainer get its name?
Isn't that pretty obvious?
It comes out every day and it's the university daily.
So The Daily Complainer.
- The Daily--
- No, I meant--
Oh, you mean, why The Complainer?
The name dates from Seven Oaks' earliest days as a divinity school.
The reference is to the Book of Job.
Job's complaint with the world.
Before justice can be achieved, a complaint must be made.
That is what we do and people don't like it a bit.
Right now, what that means is extirpating Seven Oaks' elitist Roman Letter Clubs that are like a cancer on the community.
They're not elitist in the least.
Yes, they are.
Have you met any of their members?
The guys from the DU, for example?
They're barely competent for the tasks of everyday life.
They have to drink a quart of beer just to talk to a woman?
- Two quarts.
- Yet you salivate at the idea of taking the roof off their heads and throwing them on the street where who knows what would happen.
You call yourself a Christian.
- No, I don't.
- What unkindness and cruelty.
This is the darkness in the heart of man, which Joseph Conrad wrote about most eloquently.
- He was actually Polish.
- Oh, my God.
Unkind, self-righteous and pedantic.
In short, a model journalist.
You should know something about these girls.
They run the suicide center where their preferred therapy for depressed and suicidal people is tap dancing.
- l kid you not.
- Tap is a highly effective therapy as well as a dazzlingly expressive dance form that has been sadly neglected for too many years.
It's moronic and barbaric.
You expect tap dancing to solve people's problems?
No, we don't.
We're using the whole range of musical dance numbers which have proven themselves to be effective therapies for the suicidal and the hopelessly depressed.
That really got me down.
- l thought you handled it well.
- You did?
Thanks.
No, it's all this aggression and hostility that gets me down.
Not just his but also my own.
It leaves you feeling unclean.
Have you thought of taking a shower?
Maybe you'd feel better.
You're probably right.
No, there's something else.
What Lily was saying about me being conceited and arrogant.
- l'm sorry.
- No, I think you're right.
I'm really ashamed.
- You're joking.
- No, it's terrible how I've acted.
We're all Christians.
Or I should say Judeo-Christians.
Humility should be our watchword.
The essence of being a good person.
Humility comes from within.
If it's not there in the first place, where do you go to get it?
I stopped looking a long time ago.
Very good, Freak.
- You really think so?
- Yes.
Certainly.
- Five, six, seven, eight.
- Violet.
is it such a good idea to call him Freak?
What?
He's already depressed and you're calling him Freak.
That's his name.
Freak.
Freak Astaire.
That's how he wants to be called.
What are you talking about?
Lily was just saying she likes your dancing.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Are you okay?
What do you mean?
I thought you looked sad and was wondering...
- ...if there was anything we could do.
- What could you do?
Oh, I know.
You think I'm gonna kill myself and make you look bad.
No, I'm worried that you'll kill yourself and make yourself look bad.
Do you have any idea how demoralizing it is to be constantly questioned about whether you're suicidal or not?
No.
After a while, you wonder, why is everyone asking me this?
They want me to be suicidal?
Or is it just the consequence of your utter absurdity?
Excuse me.
What scent are you wearing?
- What are you talking about?
- The perfume you're wearing.
I'm not wearing any perfume!
You see, that could be the problem.
- l've become friends with a group.
- Really?
- Although they're perfume-obsessed.
- Oh, them?
Those girls?
The ones who volunteer at the center?
- Yeah.
- But they're terrible.
The blond one?
She's notorious.
- What do you mean?
- Such a bitch.
Terrible, isn't she?
- Would balsamic be okay?
- What?
Balsamic vinegar.
For the dressing.
Yeah, sure.
- What's that?
- What?
- Those.
- Artichokes?
is that what they look like?
Come on, Lily.
You've seen an artichoke before.
- You haven't?
- They look so weird.
I'm not convinced that having a suicide-prevention center prevents any suicides.
Well, the coffee's good.
If someone were determined to destroy themselves...
- ...
I don't think they'd stop for coffee.
- lt depends on what it tastes like.
- Where are we going?
- l thought I'd take Priss over to DU.
Why?
It might be helpful for her to meet some of the guys.
How would that be helpful?
They're morons.
- Oh, come on, Lily.
- No, they're morons.
No.
Not medically. I like them.
They're in that sympathetic range of being not good-looking and yet not smart.
There's something likable about that.
Spending time with them, you get the sense that you're making a difference.
For somebody suicidal, like Priss, that could be a real boost.
- l'm not suicidal.
- Oh, that's good.
It's better not to have an identity as a suicidal person, don't you think?
- Well, bye.
- Well....
- Where are you going?
- Over to Xavier's.
- ls that a good idea?
- Why wouldn't it be?
- ls his girlfriend gonna be there?
- Of course.
- Gosh, you're nosy.
- No, no, it's just a general foreboding.
"Foreboding"?
You know, you're absolutely right.
I was being nosy.
Terribly so.
- l've gotta watch that.
- Yes, we must improve ourselves.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
Lily.
- You were coming over?
- Hey.
Yeah. ls Alice home?
Alice is working.
- Oh, she is?
- But it's not a problem.
It's good you came.
Let's go to the Oak Bar.
I'll buy you a beer.
- l thought Alice would be back.
- l'll call her.
She'll join us there.
Come on.
Okay.
She's actually quite a good person.
Her entire identity revolves around helping people.
You really think that's true?
What's she have against The Complainer?
That's bizarre.
Well, she thinks the editor, Rick DeWolfe, is completely egotistical.
And your friend isn't?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi, Lily.
- Hi.
- Great.
You got the message.
- Yeah.
- Who's egotistical?
- Lily's roommate.
She sounds unbearable.
She's on a rampage against The Complainer.
Really?
Why?
She thinks the editor, Rick DeWolfe, is conceited.
- And, in fact, quite mean.
- Mean?
Yes.
He wants to close the Seven Oaks Roman Letter Clubs.
That's good, isn't it?
Everyone was against them.
- No.
- Come on.
There's no justification for those places.
They're exclusive and elitist.
The point that Violet makes is that they can't be elitist.
- They're morons.
- Yeah, elitist morons.
You'll grant they're morons.
That's a handicap.
Such people should be helped, not hounded and persecuted.
- Persecuted?
- Yes, losing the roof over your head?
That's the worst thing that can happen.
Violet thinks there could be some risk of suicide.
Because some boy might kill himself, Seven Oaks can't do what's right?
It's a factor to be considered.
- Yeah.
- No, it isn't.
You can't set policy that way.
- Excuse me, we didn't order these.
- Compliments of the guy at the bar.
That's a playboy or operator move.
Operators like that are to be avoided.
Why?
It seems generous, sending drinks to people you don't know.
- Drinks are expensive.
- Drinks to two gorgeous girls.
His intention was to seduce and he assumed he could.
- Both?
- That seems a bit harsh.
You don't know what he was thinking.
Was he alone?
Yes.
You see?
He was alone and probably lonely.
He could see that Alice and Lily were students.
Students are known for their intelligent conversation.
They can always talk about their courses.
That was probably what attracted him.
Nonsense.
Perhaps his view was even loftier.
To court Lily with a view to matrimony.
We're in the north, but a southern gentleman can wander into these parts.
Rubbish.
Seeing Lily across a crowded bar filled with the usual undergraduate slobs.
Why wouldn't a thoughtful young man seek her out?
She's lovely.
Isn't it incumbent on men and women to find ways to meet each other?
Buying drinks for a person you don't know seems to be a generous one.
Yes.
Most guys won't even pay for the women they do know.
What you've described is a playboy or operator move.
I'll grant you that it's a tactic or perhaps even a ruse but without some of that, would our species even survive?
The Lord said, "Be fruitful and multiply."
Oh, my gosh.
No, this is how the world works, seeing someone across a room.
This could be the romantic story you tell your grandchildren.
And if you do marry and have children then he'll really learn how to squander cash.
Isn't it good to know that he's basically generous from the start?
Where's Priss?
Your eyes are so striking.
So blue.
- Really?
They're blue?
- Yes.
The most piercing blue.
You must know your eyes are blue.
- No.
- What do you mean?
What?
You must know what color your eyes are.
Your eyes are very blue.
You know that.
I'm not gonna go around checking what color my eyes are.
When you look in the mirror, you see that your eyes are blue.
- Oh, come on.
- What?
I don't think my eyes have a color.
If my eyes are so blue looking out, wouldn't everything be kind of blue?
Like, have a bluish tinge to it?
Doesn't.
Just looks normal.
That's...?
That's blue?
- That color?
- Yes, of course.
Then what color is that?
Green.
You're saying that chair's green but Frank's eyes are blue?
Yes.
Then what color are the walls?
Also green.
You didn't know that?
No.
How's that possible?
You think knowing the colors is so important?
You're in college and you don't know the colors?
Doesn't that embarrass you?
Well, no.
Why should it?
That's why the 'rents are paying big bucks to send me here.
You know, to learn stuff.
Well, gotta go hit the books.
I don't think anyone should feel embarrassed about not knowing stuff.
What's embarrassing is pretending to know.
Or putting people down because you think they don't know as much.
Look, I'm happy to admit I'm completely ignorant.
That's why I'm here and plan to really hit the books.
So the next time you see me, I will know more than I do now.
I'll be older but also wiser.
Or at least know more stuff.
For me, that's education.
Cheers.
Thor's great.
He's very clear about his objectives.
He really wants to learn things.
Frank?
What a jerk.
- He's a monster.
- Oh, my gosh, Violet.
You did everything for them.
They're nothing without you.
- What a rat.
- He's a moron.
- Don't waste a tear on that creep.
- Don't waste a single breath.
- Jerk.
- Stop.
- Please.
- What?
I love Frank.
I love him.
Come on, Violet, Frank's a moron.
You are well rid of him.
- Don't say that.
- Frank's not a moron?
You know, Lily, you're a bit harsh.
This obsession with intelligence.
Do you think it has some magical quality transforming everything?
The intelligence line is not an immutable barrier.
Love can cross it.
You can love someone whose mental capacity is not large.
I know. I have.
- Well, there's a mutable barrier, then.
- Frank's stupid, we knew.
That he's a rat playboy operator, I hadn't realized.
I don't want to turn bitter.
- l worry for Frank. I care about him.
- Well, I'd stop.
No.
I love Frank.
I always will.
If that's the case, why not fight for him?
- Against Priss?
I'd never win.
- Sure you would.
Priss is a rat.
A bitch.
A rat bitch.
Don't blame Priss.
She was crushed when her blue-eyed Josh left her.
I should've known.
Of course she'd fall for Frank.
Josh and Frank are both blue-eyed heartbreakers.
Poor Violet.
She's the roommate who's so self-confident?
Yeah.
But now she's a wreck.
But there's no logic to the algebra of love.
"The algebra of love."
That sounds like the title to some lame book.
It's a title, but the book's not lame at all.
Love's algebra?
I thought it was more geometry.
Okay, the title's not good, but the book is.
What's it say?
Well, that while we're all perverse in our romantic preferences there's actually this logic or algebra to our perversity and it has something to do with how the species has evolved.
- The survival of the species?
- Yes.
And whether it will continue to do so.
No booze?
Just to find the nearest package store, you had to drive 40 miles.
- These aren't so strong.
- No, they're really strong.
I think I'd like another.
- That wouldn't be a good idea.
- Why not?
- Well....
- Are you trying to stifle me?
- Lily?
- Oh, hi.
Listen, we're gonna get something to eat.
Why don't you come with us?
- l'm with Charlie.
- l can see that.
- But you really should come.
- Why?
I just think it would be a good idea.
- But why?
- You really must come. I insist.
Lily?
Lily, are you angry?
Lily, this is it.
We're here.
What's the matter?
That was so rude.
He's a nice guy and you embarrassed him.
He's not nice.
He was trying to get you drunk.
- No, he wasn't.
- Plying you with martinis?
- l was plying myself with martinis.
- Come on, the guy's a total sleaze.
- A creep.
- You don't know anything about him.
The way he sent drinks over to our table?
Alice.
Alice, what's wrong?
I had no idea that Xavier could be so mean.
Sounds as if he was just trying to protect you.
This Charlie Walker sounds like an operator or playboy type.
No, he's not like that.
He's actually a really nice guy.
I thought he was a slick businessman.
No.
He dresses well, but he works in strategic development.
- What?
- Strategic development.
He works at SDA.
Strategic Development Associates.
- He's an associate there.
- What he is, is a strategic operator.
Violet, are you okay?
Hey, miss, rain's coming!
Better get back!
- Polly, have you seen Violet?
- No. ls something wrong?
We're not sure.
Violet!
- Violet!
- Violet!
Oh, my gosh, what happened?
I don't understand.
What were you doing?
How long were you gone for?
I'm sorry, I don't know.
I lost track of time.
But you feel better now?
Well, cleaner.
She'll say anything to get in the show.
- She'll want doughnuts.
- You don't have to be suicidal...
- ...to get doughnuts, just depressed.
- Clinically depressed.
From a clinic.
- Would you say you're depressed?
- l don't like the term.
- l prefer to say I'm in a tailspin.
- Oh, my God.
A tailspin?
She can't even say she's depressed.
She's gotta say something special.
Priss was honest.
She was depressed and she had a right to be in the show.
Now every silly tailspinner's trying to get in.
- The show is for everyone.
- No, it isn't, Freak.
To be in the center's programs, you have to be clinically depressed.
That means that you've been to a clinic and they've said that you're depressed.
Have you been to a clinic?
Have you been to a clinic?
Then you're not clinically depressed.
Violet.
Violet.
What is it?
Where are you going?
All I wanted was to make Frank happy.
I had all these plans.
Things we could've done together.
I never even got to tell him.
Hey!
Where all your boyfriends at?
Come on!
They don't wear bikinis.
They're ladies, they wear thongs.
I can't imagine where she could've gone.
Wherever she went, she should be back by now.
How did she seem when you last saw her?
Really sad about Frank.
- Still?
- Yeah.
How can someone so smart continue mooning over a dope like that?
People aren't exactly as you assume.
The Violet you know bears little resemblance to the girl I met in seventh grade.
- You met Violet in seventh grade?
- Well, her name wasn't Violet then.
What's your name?
You can tell us your name.
We won't bite.
What's your name?
Tell us.
Are you retarded?
Tell us your name.
Emily Tweeter.
- Tweeter?
Like a bird?
- That's ridiculous.
Tweeter?
Like a bird?
- Not an easy name to have at that age.
- Not at any age.
What was she like?
Timid.
Bookish.
Classic scholarship student.
Her parents were writers.
They didn't have a dime.
Finances were the least of her worries.
- What do you mean?
- Well, she was crazy.
I got stuck rooming with her on a trip when no one else would.
- lt was awful.
- Did she smell bad?
No.
Obsessive cleanliness was part of her insanity.
- You were nice to her.
- No.
The idea of being nice to weird kids hadn't arrived.
- Why was she so unpopular?
- Well, she was very strange.
Constantly setting herself odd, repetitive tasks.
Tasks?
For example, on that trip she had with her a little square suitcase.
The idea came into her head she had to move it in a precise pattern over and over again and if she didn't execute this movement flawlessly 10 times she'd start over.
Another was to slide her hand across her forehead trying not to touch her hair or eyebrows on either side also repeating it 10 times.
Any niggling thought she'd touched the hair, she'd start over.
- My God, that is insane.
- Why would she do that?
She had the conviction that if she didn't complete these tasks her parents would die.
- Was she Catholic?
- No.
But what made the whole thing really sad was that her parents did die.
Oh, my God.
Violet!
Violet?
Violet!
Violet, where are you?
Something's wrong, isn't it, dear?
You mind my asking?
Well, I do mind a little.
- Excuse me, Your Highness.
- l'm sorry.
- lt's just kind of awkward to talk about.
- No matter.
I hope you haven't come to get run over on the highway.
- What do you mean?
- Suicides.
They come down from the university.
Jump out in the road.
Get hit by the blind curve.
Hope you're not one of them.
Do I look like one of them?
I don't know.
Maybe.
Messy people, suicides.
Think only of themselves and their own deaths.
Not what comes after.
They leave quite a mess.
They don't stick around to clean it up.
So you're not one of those depressed students from the university?
I don't like the word "depressed." l prefer to say that I'm in a tailspin.
A tailspin?
- Does this tailspin involve a man?
- Yes, it does.
But I'm not as crazy as I was up till yesterday.
Apparently that's due to the salutary effect of scent on the human psyche.
Its importance is, I believe, almost incalculable.
At the motel, I happened to use this soap.
It was provided to me as a courtesy as one of the guests.
That an economical motel would provide such good soap is quite unusual.
- The scent is very precise.
- Really?
Tell me if it provokes any particular reaction in your psyche.
A state of mind.
I always knew she was unstable.
They're gonna have her photo at the registrar's.
Violet!
Violet!
You're back!
You're okay!
Not really.
Oh, my gosh, Violet, we were so worried.
Why didn't you tell us or leave a note?
I did leave a note.
Would that be a suicide note?
- l wouldn't leave without a note.
- Where did you go?
I took the train to Villafranca and checked into a motel there.
- The Motel 6?
- No, the Motel 4.
- lt's even less expensive.
- The Motel 4 in Villafranca?
- My God, you really were suicidal.
- Why'd you go?
I had to do something.
And you really thought you were gonna find the answer in Villafranca?
I'm not sure what I expected, but I might have found it.
What?
Soap?
This scent and this soap is what gives me hope.
Hello?
is anyone here?
Hello?
Lily?
- Hello?
- Oh, my gosh.
I couldn't understand where everyone was.
Sorry, I just went out to get some things.
- Where's Alice?
- Gone.
What do you mean?
Left.
We broke up.
- But when you called, you said-- - l know, I'm sorry.
I thought it better to tell you in person.
Alice couldn't control her jealousy.
It completely overwhelmed her.
Really?
What was she jealous of?
Come on.
No, what?
You.
After a while, I just couldn't handle it.
Things became impossible.
She was jealous of me?
Of course.
Would it be okay if we watch a film?
Yes.
What would you like to see?
I thought maybe Truffaut's Baisers volés.
Stolen Kisses.
Do you know it?
No, is it new?
It's a classic of French New Wave cinema.
I think you'll like it.
- But it's in color?
- Yeah.
- You don't know Truffaut?
- No.
Do you know Godard, Á bout de souffle?
- Why was Alice so jealous?
- What do you think?
She was jealous because Lily's lovely.
I don't know.
They had a lot of problems.
Of course.
You wouldn't break up a happy couple.
- What's that?
- A note Frank left.
- Really?
Recently?
- No, when we were together.
Now that most correspondence is electronic it's rare to be left anything written by hand.
Frank can write by hand?
- What is it?
- lt's not very important.
It's just all I have.
- What's it say?
- "Out for brewskis.
Back in a giff."
What's a "giff"?
One of those little motor scooters, isn't it?
I'm sure he meant to write "jiff" with a J. "Back in a jiff."
But he wrote "giff."
- Could Frank be dyslexic?
- No.
Dyslexics are intelligent.
- What's that?
- Frank's bean ball.
- He gave you his bean ball?
- Not exactly.
This is an extra.
He thought he'd leave it here just in case he lost his other one.
Gosh, Violet, you've really gotta stop thinking about Frank.
Why?
I don't wanna stop thinking about him.
Recently I had a thought that cheered me up a lot.
Life is like a long, flowing river and as a long, flowing river, some debris you never expect to see again is almost certain to reappear floating to the surface.
Frank and I may very well be together again one day.
Maybe it'll take years, but somewhere down the line he's very likely to pop up again, and I'll be there to catch him.
I don't think we've spoken about this.
What?
Have you been to the south of France?
To the walled city of Carcassonne?
- l've never been anywhere.
- But you've seen pictures of it.
No, I don't think so.
Oh, it's fascinating.
- l'd like to visit.
- You never studied the Cathars?
They were a religious movement very idealistic located mostly in the southwest of France that the Catholic Church repressed.
Oh, my God.
The Catholic Church is, like, always bad.
Ideas can't be killed as easily as people.
Especially such enlightened ones as the Cathars held.
In recent years, more and more people have returned to their beliefs.
So you're a Cathar?
Yes. I aspire to be.
I'm trying to follow the path the Cathars marked out.
That's so impressive.
I can tell you we didn't have any Cathars back home.
I think you'd be surprised.
In the Cathar view the highest form of lovemaking avoids procreation entirely.
Sure.
Condoms, right?
Well, according to Cathar ideas sex with condoms is just a parody of the procreative act.
What do you mean?
The standard, cliché form of sexual intercourse is for the man to approach a woman from the front.
Cathar lovemaking, I think you'll find very fulfilling.
I'll be very careful, we'll go slowly.
It'll be a new experience but one which I think you'll find brings an inexpressible closeness.
Might your drinks-buying friend be around?
It would be great to get complimentary cocktails.
- Charlie?
No.
- Do you still see him at all?
- He calls from time to time.
- He does?
- Why don't you introduce us?
- Why should I introduce you?
Because you know him, and we don't.
So?
"So?"
"So" is probably the unkindest word in the English language.
I can't bear it. I think it should be outlawed. "So."
You're crazy.
Come on, Lily, you have Xavier.
- You can't keep two guys for yourself.
- Guys do that all the time.
We're not guys, fortunately.
It's unconscionable for you not to bring him and introduce us.
Charlie is a friend.
He's a nice guy.
What do you mean?
I hate to think what'd happen if you got your claws into him.
That's outrageous.
We're perfectly nice.
We've met lots of pathetic guys and nothing bad's happened.
- Charlie's not pathetic.
- Well, all the better, then.
The Roman Holidays will be coming soon.
- What's that?
- A festival Roman Letter Clubs put on.
A kind of moron jamboree.
The Roman elements are the worship of Bacchus, Beerus and Blotto.
- lt could've all been so uplifting.
- Charlie.
Hey, Charlie.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
- Have you the day off?
- Yeah.
This is my friend Charlie, whom I think I've mentioned.
And, Charlie, these are my roommates.
This is....
This is Rose.
And this is Heather.
And Violet.
Charlie works for Strategic Development Associates.
He's an associate there.
You work in strategic development?
- You've heard of it?
- Of course, yes.
My cousin Jay in Philadelphia works in strategic development.
Something business-related?
Mostly business, but any kind of organization.
- Only businesses pay the big bucks.
- Nonprofits and government pay well.
That's how they keep from having profits by paying lots of money to companies like yours.
Excuse me, but aren't you in Professor Ryan's course at the Ed School?
No.
You're not in Professor Ryan's Flit Lit course?
No.
- Flit Lit?
- The dandy tradition in literature.
- l'm sure I've seen you there.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm not in any courses at the Ed School.
Good to meet you.
- lt was great to see you.
- Bye.
God, Violet, what was that about?
That guy is definitely in Professor Ryan's class.
Not possible.
He has a fulltime job for Strategic Development Associates.
He never got his coffee.
- Why lie about something like that?
- He's lying.
I find that very attractive.
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna stop cutting Professor Ryan's class.
It can be argued that Firbank was too little disciplined too unserious in his unseriousness to create works of enduring value.
But as a liberating influence on later writers such as Waugh his importance should not be discounted.
It's not Firbank's work itself but the idea of his work that so helped later writers as Thomas Love Peacock did in the previous century.
I'm not gonna come anymore.
- What a waste of time.
- Charlie.
Charlie.
- Charlie?
- Charlie, you are taking the course.
Charlie?
Who's Charlie?
- Fred, what's going on?
- Fred?
Fred. sounds like you got some explaining to do.
- Well, you were lying.
- l wasn't lying, I was making it up.
Why were you making it up?
If you were an eighth-year Ed School student, would you advertise that?
Eighth year. impressive.
But your whole life was a lie.
Dressing up in suits.
Buying people drinks.
The suits were real.
The drinks, real.
Not just drinks for people.
They were for cute girls.
There's a perfectly rational, easily explainable agenda.
So it was a playboy or operator move.
- Of course.
Transparently so.
- l admire that.
Drinks are expensive.
But strategic development, that was made up too?
- You said your cousin Jay was in it.
- What cousin Jay?
- ln Philadelphia.
- l don't have a cousin in Philadelphia.
You said your cousin Jay was working in strategic development.
I was just saying that to be friendly.
To make a kind of link.
- So your name's Fred something?
- Yes.
Fred something.
- Packenstacker?
- Oh, my God.
How crazy.
He's completely insane.
I almost dated him.
- You can say that about a lot of guys.
- l don't think he's crazy.
Making up an entirely fictitious identity, that's not crazy?
- lt's insane. it's psycho.
- Violet's identity is made up.
- l don't think she's crazy.
- No, I am.
No, this is different.
It's crazy and pathetic.
All that about strategic development he just made up.
Don't tell me that's not weird.
I've heard of strategic development.
I think it's something pretty important.
Violet, you're not gonna start going out with him.
You're not, are you?
Well, we had planned to go to the library.
- Not to the stacks, I hope.
- Yes.
Oh, my gosh, do you realize how dangerous that is?
- Dangerous?
- Yes, the stacks.
They're dark and deserted.
Anything could happen.
It's true.
With the study habits at Seven Oaks your body won't be found until spring.
Promise you won't go with him to the stacks.
Please.
Okay. I'll suggest the Randall Room.
- Don't suggest. insist.
- And please not at night.
Okay.
What are you reading?
Have you chosen a topic for your final paper?
The decline of decadence.
You think that decadence has declined?
Definitely.
Bigtime.
Major, major decline.
How?
How or in what ways?
Either.
Well, take the flit movement in literature, or homosexuality.
It's gone completely downhill, right down the tubes.
What do you mean?
Before, homosexuality was something refined, hidden aspiring to the highest levels of creativity and often achieving it.
Now it seems to be musclebound morons running around in T-shirts.
It's pretty disillusioning.
Are you gay?
Not especially, but in another era, it might have had some appeal.
- Now I just don't see the point.
- You might be romanticizing the past.
We'll never know.
The past is gone, so we might as well romanticize it.
You could be right.
I wanted to ask, how's Lily?
Lily.
She's okay.
Here, check it out.
A.L.A. Nope.
Hello.
Good afternoon.
Check it out.
The A.L.A. Heard of it?
We have a meeting on Tuesday.
- You should come by.
- What is the A.L.A.?
Just join us.
Come Tuesday.
I think you'll really like it.
So....
A fellow was passing these out, and invited us to a meeting on Tuesday.
The A.L.A.?
Oh, my God.
I thought it was something related.
No?
The A.L.A. has got nothing to do with us.
Can't you see that?
The way we express love has meaning.
It's in the context of something beautiful.
We're following our creator's teaching.
Aspiring to an ideal.
A beautiful one that brings an inexpressible closeness.
Not just to each other, but....
For the A.L.A., and those like them the love act is just hedonistic pleasure-seeking of a perverted nature.
I can't believe you'd think we had anything in common with them.
We don't.
Nothing, not an iota.
My God, can't you see that?
Lily.
Lily, come back.
Please.
Don't be that way.
- Oh, my gosh, Lily.
Are you okay?
- lt's all right.
You don't wanna talk about it?
I don't understand.
- You don't understand what?
- What is non-procreative lovemaking?
- lt could be a lot of things.
- Yeah, but in this case?
- We don't have to talk about this.
- l don't mind.
Could somebody explain what this is about?
Well, if--
Cathars don't believe in procreative sex.
They don't have intercourse the usual way.
The usual way?
- You don't have to talk about this.
- No, it's okay.
It's the normal way, from the front where you can have procreation not from the other side, where you can't.
The other side?
That's their religion?
No, but it's the direction their beliefs head in.
When they express love, that's what they do.
How horrible.
You poor girl.
What?
That's terrible what he obliged Lily to do.
Violet.
Can we talk?
You must be pretty mad at me.
No.
You're not?
Not really.
But it was so terrible how everything happened.
Your walking in on us.
Maybe it's easier that way.
That bitch!
I can't believe it. what a bitch.
- Priss?
- Of course Priss.
"l'm so stressed.
Sad.
Depressed.
I'm so tired. I'm fatigued."
She was so depressed she had to get everything her own way.
"l'm so stressed.
Frantic."
Man.
What a bitch.
Priss dumped you?
No. lt was mutual.
Oh, listen, I have a question.
You remember that bean ball that I left in your room?
Yeah.
Do you still have it?
Yeah.
Do you think I could get it back?
I lost the other one, and with everything that's happened I'd really like to have it.
Nothing like some bean ball after a breakup.
Yeah.
God, you're smart.
You always get it.
Whatever I say you understand.
Man.
Hey, Heather.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey.
Violet.
Violet, what's wrong?
I'm sorry.
Lily's lovely.
Now she's free.
Go. I understand.
Latin!
Et cetera!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
This is what comes from not teaching Latin in the schools.
Yeah, it's moronic and boorish, but it's also kind of fun, don't you think?
No.
What's that stench?
I suppose this is what happens when decadence rots society from within.
And from without.
Such a society is, I fear destined to fail and be overrun.
Maybe that's good.
Finally. it's about time those cesspools were drained.
What color would you say that chair is?
That's a chair?
I have no idea.
- Guys have preferences.
- You're going to accept that?
- You're not going to do anything?
- There's nothing to be done.
- Fred must know his own mind.
- Oh, really?
- l seriously doubt that.
- Come on.
Lily's got that slender, delicately swelling beauty...
- ...that no man can resist.
- Okay, you're probably right.
Poor Lily.
Just think of all Xavier put her through.
He just used her body.
And not even the right side.
Have you noticed that good people tend to have large posteriors?
Not everyone, by any means.
I know it's not logical.
But it does seem to be true.
The genetic link between morality and large posteriors?
Yes, I think that's well known.
You and Violet have that build.
It's nice.
You're still very attractive, but also sensible and moralistic.
I don't. I have narrow hips, but also no very strong principles.
Yes?
Oh, hi.
- Hi, Frank.
- Hey, Heather.
So I guess you guys all heard.
University's closing all the Roman Letter Houses.
Sorry.
This year's Roman Holidays did seem like the end of civilization but when civilization ends people are going to need a place to stay.
Man.
It's bad.
It's that bastard from The Complainer.
Someone from the administration's been reading it.
Hard to believe.
Bastard.
Listen we were wondering if you thought it would be okay if we stayed at the suicide center.
Okay, sure.
That sounds like a good stopgap measure.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So there's one more thing.
Remember that bean ball we talked about?
Yes.
You think I could pick that up?
Just after everything that's happened, it-- l could really use it right now.
Yes.
- What's that?
- What?
The note.
One gets so few things written by hand anymore, I guess I kept it.
"Out for brewskis, back in a giff."
What's a giff?
It's the scooter.
Like a Vespa, right?
- That's what I thought.
- l was thinking about getting one.
You must've meant "jiff." "Back in a jiff."
And then misspelled it, or spelled it in a nonstandard way.
Yeah.
Not a good speller.
Thanks.
You're great.
Priss was such a bitch.
Damn.
Hey, Heather.
Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Heather is really cute.
She going out with anyone?
There might be something between her and Thor.
Thor?
Damn.
Heather and Thor?
Damn.
I'm worried about Thor.
It's hard for us to imagine how upsetting it is not knowing the colors.
It's impossible for me to imagine.
When Thor sees a rainbow, it's so much gibberish to him.
There was one this afternoon.
Oh, my gosh, he took it hard.
Recently, there was a parade in the city where the marchers carried rainbow-colored flags and banners.
Thor was so upset.
He had no idea what it meant.
What kind of retard is he?
See, that's the conclusion people jump to.
- Well, it is somewhat understandable.
- Not if you knew the full story.
What's the full story?
You know how parents love bragging about how precocious their children are?
Thor's parents had become precocity addicts constantly needing an ever-greater precocity fix.
He should've entered kindergarten.
They pushed him into first grade.
"Thor skipped a grade," they could tell.
What Thor's parents failed to consider is the work done in nursery school.
Key being the study of colors.
I suppose they just assumed that colors are knowledge people pick up.
Like, for example, not stepping on sidewalk cracks.
What's that?
I think Rose is sleeping.
Am I boring?
No, not at all.
When you have problems, it's great to hear someone else's idiotic ones.
Please go on.
- What?
- What you said about depressed people being mean, you weren't joking.
I'm sorry, you're right.
Please go on.
No.
I'm sorry.
You know how I am.
Please continue.
Thor decided he absolutely had to learn all the colors.
Both primary and mixed.
He's been hitting the books hard, and thought he'd mastered them.
Then, in town, he said, "That traffic light's blue."
I had to say, "No, it's green."
He was really upset.
Oh, hi, Lily.
Hi.
We were worried about you.
I can't bear this tension with Lily.
It's terrible to have the group divided this way.
Better not next to Robertson.
What?
Didn't you hear?
Ed students have been going up to the roof and throwing themselves off.
- But it's only two stories.
- Yes, I know.
It's terrible.
Not high enough to kill, but high enough to maim.
And particularly dangerous for anyone below.
I've got to forget about Fred.
But you really liked him.
This whole thing of a person meeting someone else first, it's so arbitrary.
- lt's terrible and cruel.
- l have to say, I was wrong about Fred.
I thought he was a playboy or operator type.
In fact, he's just another guy rendered helpless...
- ...by the attentions of a pretty girl.
- Cary!
No, don't!
I love you!
- Why did you do that?
- Oh, my God!
Cary, I love you!
Isn't the Ed School essentially a teacher's college?
Yeah.
If they can't even destroy themselves how are they going to teach America's youth?
- What do you think you're doing?
- Sorry.
Did I disturb you?
Why are you wearing tap shoes?
You out of your mind?
- l think that's pretty clear.
- l'm so sick of that.
Oh, really?
I think it's cute.
Since you won't be treating us to one of your incompetent tap routines...
- ...why don't you take those things off?
- No.
We'll do the routine.
Rose.
- Madge wants to see the routine.
- l don't want to see your routine.
- l asked you to take those off.
- We need a break.
Just briefly, please.
It's helpful to have an audience.
Rose, the music.
I'm gonna report you.
Suzanne.
For me, it'd be Madame Curie, Simone de Beauvoir...
- ...and Margaret Sanger.
- Good.
Violet.
I would say Richard Strauss, Roderick Charleston and Chubbard Checker.
- Richard Strauss?
The composer?
- Yes, that was one of his posts.
I'm not familiar with the others.
Could you tell us who they are?
Yes.
Each one of these men started an international dance craze.
Richard Strauss, the waltz.
Roderick Charleston, the Charleston.
Chubbard Checker, known as Chubby the dance we know as the twist.
Why do you consider a dance craze important?
Dance crazes enhance and elevate the human experience bringing together millions of people in a joyous celebration of our God-given faculties and passing these modes of physical expression down through the generations.
Though not so much anymore.
I thought-- Well, I assumed that the Charleston was named after the city of Charleston.
No.
Though that misconception is quite widely held.
It was Roderick Charleston.
Usually, behind some great creative phenomenon there's a person, not a town.
This is so exciting.
It's really great, isn't it?
- Hey, could you guys help?
- Sure.
What's up?
We need help packing soap which we'll distribute to Doar Dorm residents.
Cool.
What would you say are effective means to fight depression?
Maybe some of your DU brothers have an idea?
- Beer?
- No.
Beer's a downer.
Cocktails.
Hard liquor and spirits is what really gives you a lift.
It's interesting what you say.
My cousin Jay is a medical officer in Philadelphia.
He says that alcoholism by which I mean chronic, excessive consumption of alcohol is the primary self-administered treatment for depression.
- Cool.
- No.
It leaves you much worse off than before.
Oh, no, not me.
I just boot and then I feel fine.
- By "boot" do you mean vomit?
- Yes.
No.
None of the effective anti-suicide treatments involve vomiting.
- Hygiene?
- Exactly.
It's very important.
That's why we have such hope in the wonder bar.
Do you know its scent?
Transformative, we think.
This is so exciting.
When should we go over there?
- l don't think there's any rush.
- l'd like to go soon.
Doar Dorm has the highest fatality rate, as well as the worst hygiene.
Highest suicide rate.
Fatality rate. lt's uncertain what percentage were intentional and how many were just due to unawareness of gravity's laws.
I can just see those guys getting the gold packages, opening them and finding the good-smelling soap inside.
The cute packaging should prove irresistible.
And once clean, they'll start to see the world with new eyes.
The change could be dramatic.
Doar Dorm could soon become Dior Dorm.
I doubt that, to be perfectly, absolutely honest.
I love the idea.
Dior Dorm.
I adore optimism, even when it's completely absurd.
- Perhaps especially then.
- Great.
Ready?
Let's go.
Let's hurry.
Let's not get our hopes up too high, Heather.
No, you said yourself, the wonder bar is transformative.
- Hey, Violet.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Where you going?
- Doar Dorm.
- Fred, hi.
- Hey.
Good one.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
I guess it wasn't realistic to expect Doar Dorm to turn into Dior Dorm overnight.
They wouldn't even open them.
They said without the soap, the discs wouldn't fly properly.
Are you coming Friday?
Violet's launching her dance craze.
Oh, really?
That's great.
- What's the dance?
- The Sambola.
The devil's dance.
- Oh, cool.
We'll go, right?
- Yes, I'd like to.
But I have several papers to finish.
But I'd like to.
Great.
Thanks, Gus.
I don't see how we're going to start a dance craze if no guys show up.
Most guys aren't very good with the dance-craze thing.
Very good news. I was just in my procrastination seminar and the two guys from Doar Dorm had showered.
It was clear they'd used soap.
Oh, my gosh, what a difference.
Seems they'd been throwing packages so energetically, a soap bar fell out.
The unfamiliar ivory-like object intrigued them and one thing led to another, and, well.... lt was just as you said.
Isn't that great?
- Oh, look, here's Jimbo.
- Jimbo doesn't count.
Where is everybody?
Aren't we gonna be late for Violet's dance craze?
You wanna go to that?
Yeah.
- You're kidding.
- No, I love dance crazes.
Gosh, you're strange.
But aren't we already late?
No, it's later on.
Like 10, I think.
I have to confess, I've started losing patience with Violet.
Depression calls for serious treatment.
Medication.
Psychopharmaceuticals.
Talk therapy.
Are those approaches effective?
Despite the medication and therapy Ed School students are still throwing themselves off Robertson Hall.
Violet's ideas might seem a little offbeat--
A little?
Oh, my God. I don't know how much you know about Violet but there's some pretty weird stuff.
You know, Violet.
Violet Wister.
It's not even her real name.
- lt isn't?
- No, it's Emily Tweeter.
When she was 11, she went completely crazy and has had several relapses since.
So it's a little worrisome to have her counsel nearly suicidal individuals.
I can't believe it.
- What?
- Emily Tweeter.
In first grade, I had an enormous crush on a girl with that name.
- And you remember that?
- Yeah.
Pretty huge Dr. Zhivago stuff.
Any idea or even mention of her filled me with emotion.
I had a strange perspective on the world.
I don't think my brain was functioning properly.
Everything was a bit of a dream.
You think this was Violet?
You have any idea if Violet attended willamette Montessori?
In Portland?
- We didn't order these.
- Compliments of the guy at the bar.
It was so brutal how it ended between us.
I know I was too angry and a bit crazy but I thought that what we had was stronger than that.
That you would not just walk away after one disagreement.
It wasn't just that.
You mean my Cathar beliefs.
Well I am no longer a Cathar.
How is that possible?
It's been very difficult.
You've dropped your adherence to the Cathar faith?
- Yes, I have.
- Good.
Normally I'd be reluctant to comment on anyone's religion, but....
What?
I'm sorry. I guess-- l guess I'm a bit of a bigot. I just-- l could never take seriously any religion that worships on Tuesdays.
Major religions require worship on the weekend.
Friday, Saturday or Sunday.
I find it just really laudatory that people sacrifice their weekend time to worship God.
Having the Sabbath on Tuesday always seemed very bizarre to me.
It's not right.
You know what?
We'd better get to the Lone Star.
Why are you so concerned about that?
Well, it's not as if international dance crazes start every day.
We'd better hurry.
What's wrong?
Another fiasco.
Sometimes our struggle reminds me of the myth of Sisyphus.
- Who?
- The myth about the guy who pushes an enormous rock only to have it keep rolling back.
Oh, yeah.
What a knucklehead.
The important thing to remember is that he was mythical.
He never really existed.
Violet?
Did you spend any part of your education at Willamette Montessori?
In Oregon?
Why?
Sound like "tweaker."
Would you say today is very gray?
I'd say so.
Maybe blue-gray.
Yeah, no, that rings a bell now.
Bye.
I'm sorry.
Her name wasn't Emily Tweeter, but Lucy Wurlitzer.
They're not similar. I'm beginning to realize that the human memory is not the foolproof instrument we sometimes imagine.
What's worse, everyone knew about my obsession, including my parents those from whom I most wanted it kept.
So from your earliest years, you were already a playboy or operator type?
Yes. I suppose that's why secrecy seemed so desirable.
Violet, can we talk?
- What's the plural of doofus?
- Doufi.
Not doofuses?
You can say either.
"Doufi" respects the Latin root and is preferred.
"Doofuses" is also correct, although a bit inelegant.
- You've thought a lot about this.
- Yes, I've had to.
Why?
What is it?
I like Fred, he's a nice guy.
And I can see why you like him.
When I first met you and Rose, I thought you were the cool crowd.
And in many ways you are. I find your perfume and fashion sense excellent.
Thank you.
But there's a reason, I think why you are so strongly attracted to doufi.
And it's not an accident how different groups divide up.
Isn't that a rainbow?
- That's a rainbow!
- Thor.
No, Thor!
Thor, no!
Stop!
Please, stop!
He's headed for Robertson Hall!
Red.
Orange.
Yellow.
Green.
Blue. Indigo.
Hallelujah!
Lord God, thank you.
Education.
Education.
We can learn the subjects we set out to master no matter how hard or impossible they may seem.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I wasn't sure I was gonna make it.
Magenta.
Pink.
Mauve.
I miss my nice American friend.
No, you're mistaken.
- You go to London for four weeks?
- Six.
It's dangerous, parents letting children travel.
They send them off and they don't know what they'll be getting back.
I don't know what you're referring to.
You're not from London.
I'm from London.
I was there, now I'm here.
I'm from London.
I just miss my nice American friend.
Nice?
Nice?
Fine. I'm fine.
Those are not adjectives I like to use.
God gave us abilities.
He requires that we use them.
Good, better, best, excelsior, higher.
Only excellence can glorify the Lord.
Vulgarity is, in essence, blasphemous.
I'm sorry for what I was saying before.
Of course you're not linked to the doufi or even that such distinctions are valid.
No, don't apologize.
I probably do have a doufi orientation.
But behind coolness, isn't there a certain repressing squashing down, or lack of cultivation of one's humanity?
Oh, so you think that cool people have less humanity?
No, I don't think cool people are entirely inhuman.
Just enough to be cool.
In our society, there's all this propaganda in favor of uniqueness, eccentricity, et cetera.
But does the world really want or need more of such traits?
Aren't such people usually terrible pains in the neck?
What the world needs to work properly is a large mass of normal people.
I would like to be one of those.
Sorry.
But you'll still do the part?
Yeah, of course.
So do you know every number...
- ...in every Fred Astaire movie?
- There were two in our school musical.
- l know those.
- Did performing those two numbers help you overcome feelings of discouragement and despair?
Absolutely.
Freak.
Hey, everybody, let's do the Sambola.
Priredba:
IlluzN
- Look.
- Where?
There.
Yes. I think so.
Hello.
Are you a new student?
- Yes.
- Good.
We thought so.
We'd like to help you.
Help me?
What do you mean?
As a freshman, it can be very tough.
You get to college and it's supposed to be great, but it's not.
University life can be pretty bad.
- There are a lot of suicides.
- Well, attempted ones.
I'm not actually a freshman.
I'm a transfer student.
- Oh, an entering sophomore?
- Yes.
You were unhappy and are looking to recover here.
- Well, I think you will.
- Yes.
Would you welcome that?
Would our help be something you'd appreciate?
Or would you rather sink or swim on your own?
- Either way is fine.
We'll be friends.
- Yes, whichever you'd prefer.
Yes.
Sure.
Great.
We should start immediately.
Clothes can be crucial for confidence and an overall sense of well-being.
- Clothes don't have to be expensive.
- You need friends of the same size.
- You don't like my clothes?
- l'm just saying.
Move it out.
What?
What's wrong?
- What's wrong?
- You didn't notice that?
- No.
What?
- Those guys.
That smell.
That awful, acrid odor.
Have you heard of nasal shock syndrome?
Any harsh, acrid or just disgusting odor sends Rose into nasal shock.
Just from some BO?
"Just some BO"?
Oh, my God, Lily.
You must have a very high threshold for pain.
That'll serve you well at Seven Oaks.
- What do you mean?
- Seven Oaks is notorious for its BO.
It was the last of the Select Seven to go coed.
An atmosphere of male barbarism predominates...
- ...but we're going to change that.
- Yes.
Where are you going?
Gotta get to the Housing Department.
They lost my rooming assignment.
That's terrible.
You have no place to stay?
Was it just mislaid?
No, there were more acceptances than they anticipated and not enough rooms to go around, so....
Why don't you stay with us?
Really?
Don't think of this in the old-fashioned sense of going to a party to find someone or not find someone.
That's not the dynamic that we're talking about.
- What dynamic are you talking about?
- Glad you asked.
Our going to a party of this kind is more a form of youth outreach.
- Of what?
- Youth outreach.
It's not just some moronic frat-house social function.
Though it will be that too.
We've gotta keep in mind that these guys are young people.
They're essentially immature and crying out for help and guidance.
- Though they don't know it.
- No, they don't, but we do.
- Aren't they the same age as we are?
- Only numerically.
I'm a lot fatter than you are, but I think we could pin it.
Oh, my gosh, that's beautiful.
Stunning.
Take Frank, my friend.
He's not some cool, handsome, studly macho type.
No, not at all.
I can't stand guys like that.
He's more of a sad sack really, wouldn't you say?
- Definitely.
- What is a sad sack?
A loser.
- You like losers?
- Very much so.
Do you know what's the major problem in social life?
What?
The tendency, widespread, to always seek someone cooler than yourself.
It's always a stretch.
Often a big stretch.
Why not find someone who's inferior?
- Someone like Frank.
- Yes. lt's more rewarding.
And, in fact, quite reassuring.
You mean someone you can help, not just thinking of yourself.
Yes, that's it, precisely.
But without the goody-goody implications.
Our aspirations are pretty basic.
Take a guy who hasn't realized his full potential or doesn't even have much and then help him realize it or find more.
There's enough material here for a lifetime of social work.
What's really worrisome is that that was intentional.
Frank.
Frank, this is Lily.
She's just come to Seven Oaks as a transfer student. lsn't she great?
Lily failed or wasn't happy at her last school.
We're sure that she's going to adapt here.
- ln fact, she already has.
- Oh, good.
Oh, my God.
A golden oldie.
I love these.
- Oh, my gosh.
Wasn't that great?
- That was really fun.
I know that people can have useful careers in many areas.
Medicine, government, law, finance.
- Education.
- Yes, even education.
But I'd like to do something especially significant in my lifetime.
That could change the course of human history.
- Such as starting a new dance craze.
- Really?
Yes.
Something that could improve the lives of every person and every couple.
I'm so proud of what you accomplished last night.
You showed those guys a really good time.
Without anything really bad happening.
That's good.
The guys you know, are they all Greeks?
- What?
- Are all the guys you know Greeks?
Excuse me. I don't understand.
Are all the guys you know Greeks?
- l don't think we know any Greeks.
- Greeks, like frat boys.
Oh, yes.
Fraternities.
You mean members of the Greek-letter fraternities.
Yeah.
Like last night.
Actually, last night we were at the DU house.
DU.
Roman letters.
Not Greek.
Seven Oaks has never had a Greek-letter fraternity system.
It's always been a Roman-letter system here.
It's very different.
- What house is this?
- Oh, this isn't a fraternity.
At least not one anyone should want to join.
You probably think we're frivolous, empty-headed college coeds.
You're probably right.
I often feel empty-headed.
We're trying to make a difference in people's lives.
One way to do that is to stop them from killing themselves.
Have you ever heard of "Prevention is nine-tenths the cure"?
Well, in the case of suicide, it's actually 1 0-tenths the cure.
- Those are clichés, aren't they?
- Yes, they are.
It's interesting you say that. I love clichés and hackneyed expressions.
- Do you know why?
- No.
Because they're largely true.
The hundreds, perhaps thousands of such clichés and hackneyed expressions that our language has bequeathed us are a stunning treasure trove of human insight and knowledge.
- Really?
- Yes.
Oh, please sit down.
During these formative college years we should learn as many clichéd and hackneyed thoughts as possible.
Furthermore, I think we will.
Speaking of suicide prevention, do you have a boyfriend, Lily?
- Are you dating anyone?
- l don't see the connection.
- You don't?
- Boyfriends are a primary suicide risk.
You don't have any particular friend?
No one at all?
No.
Well, there's this grad student I met over summer.
Xavier.
We became pretty good pals.
He has a girlfriend whom I've met.
She's very nice.
"Zavier." With a Z?
- No, I think it's with an X.
- No, I'm certain it's Z.
Zavier, like Zorro.
It's the same sound.
Zorro marked his name with a Z.
It's an X.
But Zorro's with a Z.
Okay, let me see if I can figure this out.
Used at the beginning of a name, Z and X have the same pronunciation.
- But it's Zorro with a Z.
- Actually, there were two Zorros.
One spelled his name with a Z and made a Z mark for Zorro.
And there's Xorro who spelled his name with an X and with his sword he'd make an X mark.
What was really unfair was because he marked his name with X everybody assumed he was illiterate when he was spelling correctly.
- Hello.
- Can we help you?
Of course we can.
No case is too challenging.
- Would you like a doughnut?
- Okay.
Please, sit down.
- Here, have some coffee.
- Thank you.
- What's your name?
- Jim Bose.
- But my friends call me Jimbo.
- Why?
- What?
- Why do your friends call you Jimbo?
Well, it's a contraction of Jim and the first part of my last name, Bose.
Yeah, I got that.
But why bother?
- What do you mean?
- Jim is already a lovely name.
It's short, simple, evocative.
Shouldn't a nickname simplify the name that it replaces?
Jimbo doesn't really simplify anything.
I don't know.
Well, maybe you should ask your friends.
Where do you live or reside?
Doar Dorm.
- Oh, my God.
Yuck.
- What?
- The smell, it's notorious.
- What smell?
You're right, it's more like a stink.
Unclean clothing, I'd say, mostly.
- Vomit.
- Stale beer.
Pot.
Cheap deodorant.
There might be a vermin infestation.
Did you know a good-smelling environment is crucial to our sense of well-being?
Have you tried to find a better-smelling place?
Wait, wait.
It's not me, I'm not depressed.
- You're not?
- No.
Are you sure?
You kind of seem on edge.
- No, I'm fine.
- That's a terrible expression. "Fine."
"l'm fine."
Something smug about it. "l'm fine."
- Why do you say that you're fine?
- l'm not depressed. I'm not suicidal.
Why are you here, then?
Are you a con man?
- A confidence trickster?
- No, there's a girl.
Her boyfriend dumped her.
She was crying but now is silent.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you say so?
We have to go.
Call the cops!
A suicide might be in progress!
- The campus cops?
- Yes, of course the campus cops.
Take this.
We have a lot of students coming to the center pretending to be depressed to get doughnuts.
- Confidence tricksters.
- Yes, it's really bad.
Really cynical.
We pledged to the doughnut company we would only give doughnuts to students who were depressed or otherwise nutty.
We're a nonprofit, so the rules are pretty strict.
- This man could still be a trickster.
- Well, we'll soon find out.
Tell me about this girl.
Well, her name is Priss.
She's very pretty.
Oh, yes. lt's very hard for beautiful women to experience rejection.
Priss?
Priss.
Are you okay?
Priss!
Priss, say something!
Priss!
Open up!
Oh, thank God.
We're gonna have to force this door.
Priss?
Are you okay?
- What?
- Please don't.
Please, come with us.
Do you wanna talk about it?
What was his name?
Josh.
If you'd rather not talk, we don't have to.
No, it's okay, I just....
l keep thinking how he used to gaze at me with such love in his eyes.
You know what I mean?
No.
No, I've never actually seen that.
Yes.
Just days ago, he'd gaze at me.
His eyes, so blue.
He had blue eyes?
So does Frank.
Frank's the guy that I go out with.
Otherwise, he's not conventionally good-looking, which I actually prefer.
Would you describe Josh as handsome?
- That's a problem.
- Could I join you guys?
Yes, please.
Priss and I were just talking.
In my view, handsome men are to be avoided.
I don't even consider good looks to be flattering in a man.
- Do you know what I mean?
- No.
Cookie-cutter, good-looking guys, with their chiseled features running around, full of themselves getting everything they want, never suffering or experiencing--
We suffered?
We're not under discussion.
That's irrelevant.
That's besides the point.
- ls this making you feel any better?
- Yes. I think so.
Good. I hoped it would.
Okay, it's nearly 4 and The Daily Complainer's orientation meeting is about to start and I think we should go.
The editor, Rick DeWolfe, he's terrible.
A real jerk.
Why do you think he's such a jerk?
He's one of those that I was talking about.
Tall.
Probably considers himself very smart and handsome.
A journalist, so you can imagine the mindboggling arrogance and conceit.
- But, Violet, don't you think--?
- What?
Well, don't you think that the way you talk could be considered arrogant too?
I mean, a little?
Yes, of course.
But what's your point?
Wouldn't that be hypocritical, criticizing Rick for something you could be criticized for yourself?
No. I don't see why.
We're all flawed.
Must that render us mute to the flaws of others?
Must we tether ourselves from comment because our natures are human too?
We've got a rebel amongst us.
That's good, I think. lt's good to be challenged and criticized.
I know your intentions are good, it's just--
That's it precisely.
Our intentions are good.
We're seeking to help people rescue their lives from terrible sadness and failure which is a worthy goal, don't you think?
Yes.
But not exactly a humble one.
No.
I agree with you there.
You're right, absolutely.
I'd like to thank you for this chastisement.
- l'm sorry, I didn't mean to chastise.
- No, I think you did and I think it's good.
It's good to have a friend to put one in one's place when that's what one needs.
Now I see that I have that kind of friend in you.
I think that's great.
Hello, people.
Listen up.
People, quiet.
Quiet, people.
Shut up!
Okay, that's better. I'm Rick DeWolfe, editor of The Complainer.
Over the next weeks, I'm the person you're gonna hate most in the world.
You're gonna hate me because I'm gonna work you point out your stupidity and incompetence and do everything in my power to turn you into journalists.
- Albeit barely literate ones.
- Oh, brother.
Any questions?
No?
Yes.
How did The Daily Complainer get its name?
Isn't that pretty obvious?
It comes out every day and it's the university daily.
So The Daily Complainer.
- The Daily--
- No, I meant--
Oh, you mean, why The Complainer?
The name dates from Seven Oaks' earliest days as a divinity school.
The reference is to the Book of Job.
Job's complaint with the world.
Before justice can be achieved, a complaint must be made.
That is what we do and people don't like it a bit.
Right now, what that means is extirpating Seven Oaks' elitist Roman Letter Clubs that are like a cancer on the community.
They're not elitist in the least.
Yes, they are.
Have you met any of their members?
The guys from the DU, for example?
They're barely competent for the tasks of everyday life.
They have to drink a quart of beer just to talk to a woman?
- Two quarts.
- Yet you salivate at the idea of taking the roof off their heads and throwing them on the street where who knows what would happen.
You call yourself a Christian.
- No, I don't.
- What unkindness and cruelty.
This is the darkness in the heart of man, which Joseph Conrad wrote about most eloquently.
- He was actually Polish.
- Oh, my God.
Unkind, self-righteous and pedantic.
In short, a model journalist.
You should know something about these girls.
They run the suicide center where their preferred therapy for depressed and suicidal people is tap dancing.
- l kid you not.
- Tap is a highly effective therapy as well as a dazzlingly expressive dance form that has been sadly neglected for too many years.
It's moronic and barbaric.
You expect tap dancing to solve people's problems?
No, we don't.
We're using the whole range of musical dance numbers which have proven themselves to be effective therapies for the suicidal and the hopelessly depressed.
That really got me down.
- l thought you handled it well.
- You did?
Thanks.
No, it's all this aggression and hostility that gets me down.
Not just his but also my own.
It leaves you feeling unclean.
Have you thought of taking a shower?
Maybe you'd feel better.
You're probably right.
No, there's something else.
What Lily was saying about me being conceited and arrogant.
- l'm sorry.
- No, I think you're right.
I'm really ashamed.
- You're joking.
- No, it's terrible how I've acted.
We're all Christians.
Or I should say Judeo-Christians.
Humility should be our watchword.
The essence of being a good person.
Humility comes from within.
If it's not there in the first place, where do you go to get it?
I stopped looking a long time ago.
Very good, Freak.
- You really think so?
- Yes.
Certainly.
- Five, six, seven, eight.
- Violet.
is it such a good idea to call him Freak?
What?
He's already depressed and you're calling him Freak.
That's his name.
Freak.
Freak Astaire.
That's how he wants to be called.
What are you talking about?
Lily was just saying she likes your dancing.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Are you okay?
What do you mean?
I thought you looked sad and was wondering...
- ...if there was anything we could do.
- What could you do?
Oh, I know.
You think I'm gonna kill myself and make you look bad.
No, I'm worried that you'll kill yourself and make yourself look bad.
Do you have any idea how demoralizing it is to be constantly questioned about whether you're suicidal or not?
No.
After a while, you wonder, why is everyone asking me this?
They want me to be suicidal?
Or is it just the consequence of your utter absurdity?
Excuse me.
What scent are you wearing?
- What are you talking about?
- The perfume you're wearing.
I'm not wearing any perfume!
You see, that could be the problem.
- l've become friends with a group.
- Really?
- Although they're perfume-obsessed.
- Oh, them?
Those girls?
The ones who volunteer at the center?
- Yeah.
- But they're terrible.
The blond one?
She's notorious.
- What do you mean?
- Such a bitch.
Terrible, isn't she?
- Would balsamic be okay?
- What?
Balsamic vinegar.
For the dressing.
Yeah, sure.
- What's that?
- What?
- Those.
- Artichokes?
is that what they look like?
Come on, Lily.
You've seen an artichoke before.
- You haven't?
- They look so weird.
I'm not convinced that having a suicide-prevention center prevents any suicides.
Well, the coffee's good.
If someone were determined to destroy themselves...
- ...
I don't think they'd stop for coffee.
- lt depends on what it tastes like.
- Where are we going?
- l thought I'd take Priss over to DU.
Why?
It might be helpful for her to meet some of the guys.
How would that be helpful?
They're morons.
- Oh, come on, Lily.
- No, they're morons.
No.
Not medically. I like them.
They're in that sympathetic range of being not good-looking and yet not smart.
There's something likable about that.
Spending time with them, you get the sense that you're making a difference.
For somebody suicidal, like Priss, that could be a real boost.
- l'm not suicidal.
- Oh, that's good.
It's better not to have an identity as a suicidal person, don't you think?
- Well, bye.
- Well....
- Where are you going?
- Over to Xavier's.
- ls that a good idea?
- Why wouldn't it be?
- ls his girlfriend gonna be there?
- Of course.
- Gosh, you're nosy.
- No, no, it's just a general foreboding.
"Foreboding"?
You know, you're absolutely right.
I was being nosy.
Terribly so.
- l've gotta watch that.
- Yes, we must improve ourselves.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
Lily.
- You were coming over?
- Hey.
Yeah. ls Alice home?
Alice is working.
- Oh, she is?
- But it's not a problem.
It's good you came.
Let's go to the Oak Bar.
I'll buy you a beer.
- l thought Alice would be back.
- l'll call her.
She'll join us there.
Come on.
Okay.
She's actually quite a good person.
Her entire identity revolves around helping people.
You really think that's true?
What's she have against The Complainer?
That's bizarre.
Well, she thinks the editor, Rick DeWolfe, is completely egotistical.
And your friend isn't?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi, Lily.
- Hi.
- Great.
You got the message.
- Yeah.
- Who's egotistical?
- Lily's roommate.
She sounds unbearable.
She's on a rampage against The Complainer.
Really?
Why?
She thinks the editor, Rick DeWolfe, is conceited.
- And, in fact, quite mean.
- Mean?
Yes.
He wants to close the Seven Oaks Roman Letter Clubs.
That's good, isn't it?
Everyone was against them.
- No.
- Come on.
There's no justification for those places.
They're exclusive and elitist.
The point that Violet makes is that they can't be elitist.
- They're morons.
- Yeah, elitist morons.
You'll grant they're morons.
That's a handicap.
Such people should be helped, not hounded and persecuted.
- Persecuted?
- Yes, losing the roof over your head?
That's the worst thing that can happen.
Violet thinks there could be some risk of suicide.
Because some boy might kill himself, Seven Oaks can't do what's right?
It's a factor to be considered.
- Yeah.
- No, it isn't.
You can't set policy that way.
- Excuse me, we didn't order these.
- Compliments of the guy at the bar.
That's a playboy or operator move.
Operators like that are to be avoided.
Why?
It seems generous, sending drinks to people you don't know.
- Drinks are expensive.
- Drinks to two gorgeous girls.
His intention was to seduce and he assumed he could.
- Both?
- That seems a bit harsh.
You don't know what he was thinking.
Was he alone?
Yes.
You see?
He was alone and probably lonely.
He could see that Alice and Lily were students.
Students are known for their intelligent conversation.
They can always talk about their courses.
That was probably what attracted him.
Nonsense.
Perhaps his view was even loftier.
To court Lily with a view to matrimony.
We're in the north, but a southern gentleman can wander into these parts.
Rubbish.
Seeing Lily across a crowded bar filled with the usual undergraduate slobs.
Why wouldn't a thoughtful young man seek her out?
She's lovely.
Isn't it incumbent on men and women to find ways to meet each other?
Buying drinks for a person you don't know seems to be a generous one.
Yes.
Most guys won't even pay for the women they do know.
What you've described is a playboy or operator move.
I'll grant you that it's a tactic or perhaps even a ruse but without some of that, would our species even survive?
The Lord said, "Be fruitful and multiply."
Oh, my gosh.
No, this is how the world works, seeing someone across a room.
This could be the romantic story you tell your grandchildren.
And if you do marry and have children then he'll really learn how to squander cash.
Isn't it good to know that he's basically generous from the start?
Where's Priss?
Your eyes are so striking.
So blue.
- Really?
They're blue?
- Yes.
The most piercing blue.
You must know your eyes are blue.
- No.
- What do you mean?
What?
You must know what color your eyes are.
Your eyes are very blue.
You know that.
I'm not gonna go around checking what color my eyes are.
When you look in the mirror, you see that your eyes are blue.
- Oh, come on.
- What?
I don't think my eyes have a color.
If my eyes are so blue looking out, wouldn't everything be kind of blue?
Like, have a bluish tinge to it?
Doesn't.
Just looks normal.
That's...?
That's blue?
- That color?
- Yes, of course.
Then what color is that?
Green.
You're saying that chair's green but Frank's eyes are blue?
Yes.
Then what color are the walls?
Also green.
You didn't know that?
No.
How's that possible?
You think knowing the colors is so important?
You're in college and you don't know the colors?
Doesn't that embarrass you?
Well, no.
Why should it?
That's why the 'rents are paying big bucks to send me here.
You know, to learn stuff.
Well, gotta go hit the books.
I don't think anyone should feel embarrassed about not knowing stuff.
What's embarrassing is pretending to know.
Or putting people down because you think they don't know as much.
Look, I'm happy to admit I'm completely ignorant.
That's why I'm here and plan to really hit the books.
So the next time you see me, I will know more than I do now.
I'll be older but also wiser.
Or at least know more stuff.
For me, that's education.
Cheers.
Thor's great.
He's very clear about his objectives.
He really wants to learn things.
Frank?
What a jerk.
- He's a monster.
- Oh, my gosh, Violet.
You did everything for them.
They're nothing without you.
- What a rat.
- He's a moron.
- Don't waste a tear on that creep.
- Don't waste a single breath.
- Jerk.
- Stop.
- Please.
- What?
I love Frank.
I love him.
Come on, Violet, Frank's a moron.
You are well rid of him.
- Don't say that.
- Frank's not a moron?
You know, Lily, you're a bit harsh.
This obsession with intelligence.
Do you think it has some magical quality transforming everything?
The intelligence line is not an immutable barrier.
Love can cross it.
You can love someone whose mental capacity is not large.
I know. I have.
- Well, there's a mutable barrier, then.
- Frank's stupid, we knew.
That he's a rat playboy operator, I hadn't realized.
I don't want to turn bitter.
- l worry for Frank. I care about him.
- Well, I'd stop.
No.
I love Frank.
I always will.
If that's the case, why not fight for him?
- Against Priss?
I'd never win.
- Sure you would.
Priss is a rat.
A bitch.
A rat bitch.
Don't blame Priss.
She was crushed when her blue-eyed Josh left her.
I should've known.
Of course she'd fall for Frank.
Josh and Frank are both blue-eyed heartbreakers.
Poor Violet.
She's the roommate who's so self-confident?
Yeah.
But now she's a wreck.
But there's no logic to the algebra of love.
"The algebra of love."
That sounds like the title to some lame book.
It's a title, but the book's not lame at all.
Love's algebra?
I thought it was more geometry.
Okay, the title's not good, but the book is.
What's it say?
Well, that while we're all perverse in our romantic preferences there's actually this logic or algebra to our perversity and it has something to do with how the species has evolved.
- The survival of the species?
- Yes.
And whether it will continue to do so.
No booze?
Just to find the nearest package store, you had to drive 40 miles.
- These aren't so strong.
- No, they're really strong.
I think I'd like another.
- That wouldn't be a good idea.
- Why not?
- Well....
- Are you trying to stifle me?
- Lily?
- Oh, hi.
Listen, we're gonna get something to eat.
Why don't you come with us?
- l'm with Charlie.
- l can see that.
- But you really should come.
- Why?
I just think it would be a good idea.
- But why?
- You really must come. I insist.
Lily?
Lily, are you angry?
Lily, this is it.
We're here.
What's the matter?
That was so rude.
He's a nice guy and you embarrassed him.
He's not nice.
He was trying to get you drunk.
- No, he wasn't.
- Plying you with martinis?
- l was plying myself with martinis.
- Come on, the guy's a total sleaze.
- A creep.
- You don't know anything about him.
The way he sent drinks over to our table?
Alice.
Alice, what's wrong?
I had no idea that Xavier could be so mean.
Sounds as if he was just trying to protect you.
This Charlie Walker sounds like an operator or playboy type.
No, he's not like that.
He's actually a really nice guy.
I thought he was a slick businessman.
No.
He dresses well, but he works in strategic development.
- What?
- Strategic development.
He works at SDA.
Strategic Development Associates.
- He's an associate there.
- What he is, is a strategic operator.
Violet, are you okay?
Hey, miss, rain's coming!
Better get back!
- Polly, have you seen Violet?
- No. ls something wrong?
We're not sure.
Violet!
- Violet!
- Violet!
Oh, my gosh, what happened?
I don't understand.
What were you doing?
How long were you gone for?
I'm sorry, I don't know.
I lost track of time.
But you feel better now?
Well, cleaner.
She'll say anything to get in the show.
- She'll want doughnuts.
- You don't have to be suicidal...
- ...to get doughnuts, just depressed.
- Clinically depressed.
From a clinic.
- Would you say you're depressed?
- l don't like the term.
- l prefer to say I'm in a tailspin.
- Oh, my God.
A tailspin?
She can't even say she's depressed.
She's gotta say something special.
Priss was honest.
She was depressed and she had a right to be in the show.
Now every silly tailspinner's trying to get in.
- The show is for everyone.
- No, it isn't, Freak.
To be in the center's programs, you have to be clinically depressed.
That means that you've been to a clinic and they've said that you're depressed.
Have you been to a clinic?
Have you been to a clinic?
Then you're not clinically depressed.
Violet.
Violet.
What is it?
Where are you going?
All I wanted was to make Frank happy.
I had all these plans.
Things we could've done together.
I never even got to tell him.
Hey!
Where all your boyfriends at?
Come on!
They don't wear bikinis.
They're ladies, they wear thongs.
I can't imagine where she could've gone.
Wherever she went, she should be back by now.
How did she seem when you last saw her?
Really sad about Frank.
- Still?
- Yeah.
How can someone so smart continue mooning over a dope like that?
People aren't exactly as you assume.
The Violet you know bears little resemblance to the girl I met in seventh grade.
- You met Violet in seventh grade?
- Well, her name wasn't Violet then.
What's your name?
You can tell us your name.
We won't bite.
What's your name?
Tell us.
Are you retarded?
Tell us your name.
Emily Tweeter.
- Tweeter?
Like a bird?
- That's ridiculous.
Tweeter?
Like a bird?
- Not an easy name to have at that age.
- Not at any age.
What was she like?
Timid.
Bookish.
Classic scholarship student.
Her parents were writers.
They didn't have a dime.
Finances were the least of her worries.
- What do you mean?
- Well, she was crazy.
I got stuck rooming with her on a trip when no one else would.
- lt was awful.
- Did she smell bad?
No.
Obsessive cleanliness was part of her insanity.
- You were nice to her.
- No.
The idea of being nice to weird kids hadn't arrived.
- Why was she so unpopular?
- Well, she was very strange.
Constantly setting herself odd, repetitive tasks.
Tasks?
For example, on that trip she had with her a little square suitcase.
The idea came into her head she had to move it in a precise pattern over and over again and if she didn't execute this movement flawlessly 10 times she'd start over.
Another was to slide her hand across her forehead trying not to touch her hair or eyebrows on either side also repeating it 10 times.
Any niggling thought she'd touched the hair, she'd start over.
- My God, that is insane.
- Why would she do that?
She had the conviction that if she didn't complete these tasks her parents would die.
- Was she Catholic?
- No.
But what made the whole thing really sad was that her parents did die.
Oh, my God.
Violet!
Violet?
Violet!
Violet, where are you?
Something's wrong, isn't it, dear?
You mind my asking?
Well, I do mind a little.
- Excuse me, Your Highness.
- l'm sorry.
- lt's just kind of awkward to talk about.
- No matter.
I hope you haven't come to get run over on the highway.
- What do you mean?
- Suicides.
They come down from the university.
Jump out in the road.
Get hit by the blind curve.
Hope you're not one of them.
Do I look like one of them?
I don't know.
Maybe.
Messy people, suicides.
Think only of themselves and their own deaths.
Not what comes after.
They leave quite a mess.
They don't stick around to clean it up.
So you're not one of those depressed students from the university?
I don't like the word "depressed." l prefer to say that I'm in a tailspin.
A tailspin?
- Does this tailspin involve a man?
- Yes, it does.
But I'm not as crazy as I was up till yesterday.
Apparently that's due to the salutary effect of scent on the human psyche.
Its importance is, I believe, almost incalculable.
At the motel, I happened to use this soap.
It was provided to me as a courtesy as one of the guests.
That an economical motel would provide such good soap is quite unusual.
- The scent is very precise.
- Really?
Tell me if it provokes any particular reaction in your psyche.
A state of mind.
I always knew she was unstable.
They're gonna have her photo at the registrar's.
Violet!
Violet!
You're back!
You're okay!
Not really.
Oh, my gosh, Violet, we were so worried.
Why didn't you tell us or leave a note?
I did leave a note.
Would that be a suicide note?
- l wouldn't leave without a note.
- Where did you go?
I took the train to Villafranca and checked into a motel there.
- The Motel 6?
- No, the Motel 4.
- lt's even less expensive.
- The Motel 4 in Villafranca?
- My God, you really were suicidal.
- Why'd you go?
I had to do something.
And you really thought you were gonna find the answer in Villafranca?
I'm not sure what I expected, but I might have found it.
What?
Soap?
This scent and this soap is what gives me hope.
Hello?
is anyone here?
Hello?
Lily?
- Hello?
- Oh, my gosh.
I couldn't understand where everyone was.
Sorry, I just went out to get some things.
- Where's Alice?
- Gone.
What do you mean?
Left.
We broke up.
- But when you called, you said-- - l know, I'm sorry.
I thought it better to tell you in person.
Alice couldn't control her jealousy.
It completely overwhelmed her.
Really?
What was she jealous of?
Come on.
No, what?
You.
After a while, I just couldn't handle it.
Things became impossible.
She was jealous of me?
Of course.
Would it be okay if we watch a film?
Yes.
What would you like to see?
I thought maybe Truffaut's Baisers volés.
Stolen Kisses.
Do you know it?
No, is it new?
It's a classic of French New Wave cinema.
I think you'll like it.
- But it's in color?
- Yeah.
- You don't know Truffaut?
- No.
Do you know Godard, Á bout de souffle?
- Why was Alice so jealous?
- What do you think?
She was jealous because Lily's lovely.
I don't know.
They had a lot of problems.
Of course.
You wouldn't break up a happy couple.
- What's that?
- A note Frank left.
- Really?
Recently?
- No, when we were together.
Now that most correspondence is electronic it's rare to be left anything written by hand.
Frank can write by hand?
- What is it?
- lt's not very important.
It's just all I have.
- What's it say?
- "Out for brewskis.
Back in a giff."
What's a "giff"?
One of those little motor scooters, isn't it?
I'm sure he meant to write "jiff" with a J. "Back in a jiff."
But he wrote "giff."
- Could Frank be dyslexic?
- No.
Dyslexics are intelligent.
- What's that?
- Frank's bean ball.
- He gave you his bean ball?
- Not exactly.
This is an extra.
He thought he'd leave it here just in case he lost his other one.
Gosh, Violet, you've really gotta stop thinking about Frank.
Why?
I don't wanna stop thinking about him.
Recently I had a thought that cheered me up a lot.
Life is like a long, flowing river and as a long, flowing river, some debris you never expect to see again is almost certain to reappear floating to the surface.
Frank and I may very well be together again one day.
Maybe it'll take years, but somewhere down the line he's very likely to pop up again, and I'll be there to catch him.
I don't think we've spoken about this.
What?
Have you been to the south of France?
To the walled city of Carcassonne?
- l've never been anywhere.
- But you've seen pictures of it.
No, I don't think so.
Oh, it's fascinating.
- l'd like to visit.
- You never studied the Cathars?
They were a religious movement very idealistic located mostly in the southwest of France that the Catholic Church repressed.
Oh, my God.
The Catholic Church is, like, always bad.
Ideas can't be killed as easily as people.
Especially such enlightened ones as the Cathars held.
In recent years, more and more people have returned to their beliefs.
So you're a Cathar?
Yes. I aspire to be.
I'm trying to follow the path the Cathars marked out.
That's so impressive.
I can tell you we didn't have any Cathars back home.
I think you'd be surprised.
In the Cathar view the highest form of lovemaking avoids procreation entirely.
Sure.
Condoms, right?
Well, according to Cathar ideas sex with condoms is just a parody of the procreative act.
What do you mean?
The standard, cliché form of sexual intercourse is for the man to approach a woman from the front.
Cathar lovemaking, I think you'll find very fulfilling.
I'll be very careful, we'll go slowly.
It'll be a new experience but one which I think you'll find brings an inexpressible closeness.
Might your drinks-buying friend be around?
It would be great to get complimentary cocktails.
- Charlie?
No.
- Do you still see him at all?
- He calls from time to time.
- He does?
- Why don't you introduce us?
- Why should I introduce you?
Because you know him, and we don't.
So?
"So?"
"So" is probably the unkindest word in the English language.
I can't bear it. I think it should be outlawed. "So."
You're crazy.
Come on, Lily, you have Xavier.
- You can't keep two guys for yourself.
- Guys do that all the time.
We're not guys, fortunately.
It's unconscionable for you not to bring him and introduce us.
Charlie is a friend.
He's a nice guy.
What do you mean?
I hate to think what'd happen if you got your claws into him.
That's outrageous.
We're perfectly nice.
We've met lots of pathetic guys and nothing bad's happened.
- Charlie's not pathetic.
- Well, all the better, then.
The Roman Holidays will be coming soon.
- What's that?
- A festival Roman Letter Clubs put on.
A kind of moron jamboree.
The Roman elements are the worship of Bacchus, Beerus and Blotto.
- lt could've all been so uplifting.
- Charlie.
Hey, Charlie.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
- Have you the day off?
- Yeah.
This is my friend Charlie, whom I think I've mentioned.
And, Charlie, these are my roommates.
This is....
This is Rose.
And this is Heather.
And Violet.
Charlie works for Strategic Development Associates.
He's an associate there.
You work in strategic development?
- You've heard of it?
- Of course, yes.
My cousin Jay in Philadelphia works in strategic development.
Something business-related?
Mostly business, but any kind of organization.
- Only businesses pay the big bucks.
- Nonprofits and government pay well.
That's how they keep from having profits by paying lots of money to companies like yours.
Excuse me, but aren't you in Professor Ryan's course at the Ed School?
No.
You're not in Professor Ryan's Flit Lit course?
No.
- Flit Lit?
- The dandy tradition in literature.
- l'm sure I've seen you there.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm not in any courses at the Ed School.
Good to meet you.
- lt was great to see you.
- Bye.
God, Violet, what was that about?
That guy is definitely in Professor Ryan's class.
Not possible.
He has a fulltime job for Strategic Development Associates.
He never got his coffee.
- Why lie about something like that?
- He's lying.
I find that very attractive.
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna stop cutting Professor Ryan's class.
It can be argued that Firbank was too little disciplined too unserious in his unseriousness to create works of enduring value.
But as a liberating influence on later writers such as Waugh his importance should not be discounted.
It's not Firbank's work itself but the idea of his work that so helped later writers as Thomas Love Peacock did in the previous century.
I'm not gonna come anymore.
- What a waste of time.
- Charlie.
Charlie.
- Charlie?
- Charlie, you are taking the course.
Charlie?
Who's Charlie?
- Fred, what's going on?
- Fred?
Fred. sounds like you got some explaining to do.
- Well, you were lying.
- l wasn't lying, I was making it up.
Why were you making it up?
If you were an eighth-year Ed School student, would you advertise that?
Eighth year. impressive.
But your whole life was a lie.
Dressing up in suits.
Buying people drinks.
The suits were real.
The drinks, real.
Not just drinks for people.
They were for cute girls.
There's a perfectly rational, easily explainable agenda.
So it was a playboy or operator move.
- Of course.
Transparently so.
- l admire that.
Drinks are expensive.
But strategic development, that was made up too?
- You said your cousin Jay was in it.
- What cousin Jay?
- ln Philadelphia.
- l don't have a cousin in Philadelphia.
You said your cousin Jay was working in strategic development.
I was just saying that to be friendly.
To make a kind of link.
- So your name's Fred something?
- Yes.
Fred something.
- Packenstacker?
- Oh, my God.
How crazy.
He's completely insane.
I almost dated him.
- You can say that about a lot of guys.
- l don't think he's crazy.
Making up an entirely fictitious identity, that's not crazy?
- lt's insane. it's psycho.
- Violet's identity is made up.
- l don't think she's crazy.
- No, I am.
No, this is different.
It's crazy and pathetic.
All that about strategic development he just made up.
Don't tell me that's not weird.
I've heard of strategic development.
I think it's something pretty important.
Violet, you're not gonna start going out with him.
You're not, are you?
Well, we had planned to go to the library.
- Not to the stacks, I hope.
- Yes.
Oh, my gosh, do you realize how dangerous that is?
- Dangerous?
- Yes, the stacks.
They're dark and deserted.
Anything could happen.
It's true.
With the study habits at Seven Oaks your body won't be found until spring.
Promise you won't go with him to the stacks.
Please.
Okay. I'll suggest the Randall Room.
- Don't suggest. insist.
- And please not at night.
Okay.
What are you reading?
Have you chosen a topic for your final paper?
The decline of decadence.
You think that decadence has declined?
Definitely.
Bigtime.
Major, major decline.
How?
How or in what ways?
Either.
Well, take the flit movement in literature, or homosexuality.
It's gone completely downhill, right down the tubes.
What do you mean?
Before, homosexuality was something refined, hidden aspiring to the highest levels of creativity and often achieving it.
Now it seems to be musclebound morons running around in T-shirts.
It's pretty disillusioning.
Are you gay?
Not especially, but in another era, it might have had some appeal.
- Now I just don't see the point.
- You might be romanticizing the past.
We'll never know.
The past is gone, so we might as well romanticize it.
You could be right.
I wanted to ask, how's Lily?
Lily.
She's okay.
Here, check it out.
A.L.A. Nope.
Hello.
Good afternoon.
Check it out.
The A.L.A. Heard of it?
We have a meeting on Tuesday.
- You should come by.
- What is the A.L.A.?
Just join us.
Come Tuesday.
I think you'll really like it.
So....
A fellow was passing these out, and invited us to a meeting on Tuesday.
The A.L.A.?
Oh, my God.
I thought it was something related.
No?
The A.L.A. has got nothing to do with us.
Can't you see that?
The way we express love has meaning.
It's in the context of something beautiful.
We're following our creator's teaching.
Aspiring to an ideal.
A beautiful one that brings an inexpressible closeness.
Not just to each other, but....
For the A.L.A., and those like them the love act is just hedonistic pleasure-seeking of a perverted nature.
I can't believe you'd think we had anything in common with them.
We don't.
Nothing, not an iota.
My God, can't you see that?
Lily.
Lily, come back.
Please.
Don't be that way.
- Oh, my gosh, Lily.
Are you okay?
- lt's all right.
You don't wanna talk about it?
I don't understand.
- You don't understand what?
- What is non-procreative lovemaking?
- lt could be a lot of things.
- Yeah, but in this case?
- We don't have to talk about this.
- l don't mind.
Could somebody explain what this is about?
Well, if--
Cathars don't believe in procreative sex.
They don't have intercourse the usual way.
The usual way?
- You don't have to talk about this.
- No, it's okay.
It's the normal way, from the front where you can have procreation not from the other side, where you can't.
The other side?
That's their religion?
No, but it's the direction their beliefs head in.
When they express love, that's what they do.
How horrible.
You poor girl.
What?
That's terrible what he obliged Lily to do.
Violet.
Can we talk?
You must be pretty mad at me.
No.
You're not?
Not really.
But it was so terrible how everything happened.
Your walking in on us.
Maybe it's easier that way.
That bitch!
I can't believe it. what a bitch.
- Priss?
- Of course Priss.
"l'm so stressed.
Sad.
Depressed.
I'm so tired. I'm fatigued."
She was so depressed she had to get everything her own way.
"l'm so stressed.
Frantic."
Man.
What a bitch.
Priss dumped you?
No. lt was mutual.
Oh, listen, I have a question.
You remember that bean ball that I left in your room?
Yeah.
Do you still have it?
Yeah.
Do you think I could get it back?
I lost the other one, and with everything that's happened I'd really like to have it.
Nothing like some bean ball after a breakup.
Yeah.
God, you're smart.
You always get it.
Whatever I say you understand.
Man.
Hey, Heather.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey.
Violet.
Violet, what's wrong?
I'm sorry.
Lily's lovely.
Now she's free.
Go. I understand.
Latin!
Et cetera!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
This is what comes from not teaching Latin in the schools.
Yeah, it's moronic and boorish, but it's also kind of fun, don't you think?
No.
What's that stench?
I suppose this is what happens when decadence rots society from within.
And from without.
Such a society is, I fear destined to fail and be overrun.
Maybe that's good.
Finally. it's about time those cesspools were drained.
What color would you say that chair is?
That's a chair?
I have no idea.
- Guys have preferences.
- You're going to accept that?
- You're not going to do anything?
- There's nothing to be done.
- Fred must know his own mind.
- Oh, really?
- l seriously doubt that.
- Come on.
Lily's got that slender, delicately swelling beauty...
- ...that no man can resist.
- Okay, you're probably right.
Poor Lily.
Just think of all Xavier put her through.
He just used her body.
And not even the right side.
Have you noticed that good people tend to have large posteriors?
Not everyone, by any means.
I know it's not logical.
But it does seem to be true.
The genetic link between morality and large posteriors?
Yes, I think that's well known.
You and Violet have that build.
It's nice.
You're still very attractive, but also sensible and moralistic.
I don't. I have narrow hips, but also no very strong principles.
Yes?
Oh, hi.
- Hi, Frank.
- Hey, Heather.
So I guess you guys all heard.
University's closing all the Roman Letter Houses.
Sorry.
This year's Roman Holidays did seem like the end of civilization but when civilization ends people are going to need a place to stay.
Man.
It's bad.
It's that bastard from The Complainer.
Someone from the administration's been reading it.
Hard to believe.
Bastard.
Listen we were wondering if you thought it would be okay if we stayed at the suicide center.
Okay, sure.
That sounds like a good stopgap measure.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So there's one more thing.
Remember that bean ball we talked about?
Yes.
You think I could pick that up?
Just after everything that's happened, it-- l could really use it right now.
Yes.
- What's that?
- What?
The note.
One gets so few things written by hand anymore, I guess I kept it.
"Out for brewskis, back in a giff."
What's a giff?
It's the scooter.
Like a Vespa, right?
- That's what I thought.
- l was thinking about getting one.
You must've meant "jiff." "Back in a jiff."
And then misspelled it, or spelled it in a nonstandard way.
Yeah.
Not a good speller.
Thanks.
You're great.
Priss was such a bitch.
Damn.
Hey, Heather.
Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Heather is really cute.
She going out with anyone?
There might be something between her and Thor.
Thor?
Damn.
Heather and Thor?
Damn.
I'm worried about Thor.
It's hard for us to imagine how upsetting it is not knowing the colors.
It's impossible for me to imagine.
When Thor sees a rainbow, it's so much gibberish to him.
There was one this afternoon.
Oh, my gosh, he took it hard.
Recently, there was a parade in the city where the marchers carried rainbow-colored flags and banners.
Thor was so upset.
He had no idea what it meant.
What kind of retard is he?
See, that's the conclusion people jump to.
- Well, it is somewhat understandable.
- Not if you knew the full story.
What's the full story?
You know how parents love bragging about how precocious their children are?
Thor's parents had become precocity addicts constantly needing an ever-greater precocity fix.
He should've entered kindergarten.
They pushed him into first grade.
"Thor skipped a grade," they could tell.
What Thor's parents failed to consider is the work done in nursery school.
Key being the study of colors.
I suppose they just assumed that colors are knowledge people pick up.
Like, for example, not stepping on sidewalk cracks.
What's that?
I think Rose is sleeping.
Am I boring?
No, not at all.
When you have problems, it's great to hear someone else's idiotic ones.
Please go on.
- What?
- What you said about depressed people being mean, you weren't joking.
I'm sorry, you're right.
Please go on.
No.
I'm sorry.
You know how I am.
Please continue.
Thor decided he absolutely had to learn all the colors.
Both primary and mixed.
He's been hitting the books hard, and thought he'd mastered them.
Then, in town, he said, "That traffic light's blue."
I had to say, "No, it's green."
He was really upset.
Oh, hi, Lily.
Hi.
We were worried about you.
I can't bear this tension with Lily.
It's terrible to have the group divided this way.
Better not next to Robertson.
What?
Didn't you hear?
Ed students have been going up to the roof and throwing themselves off.
- But it's only two stories.
- Yes, I know.
It's terrible.
Not high enough to kill, but high enough to maim.
And particularly dangerous for anyone below.
I've got to forget about Fred.
But you really liked him.
This whole thing of a person meeting someone else first, it's so arbitrary.
- lt's terrible and cruel.
- l have to say, I was wrong about Fred.
I thought he was a playboy or operator type.
In fact, he's just another guy rendered helpless...
- ...by the attentions of a pretty girl.
- Cary!
No, don't!
I love you!
- Why did you do that?
- Oh, my God!
Cary, I love you!
Isn't the Ed School essentially a teacher's college?
Yeah.
If they can't even destroy themselves how are they going to teach America's youth?
- What do you think you're doing?
- Sorry.
Did I disturb you?
Why are you wearing tap shoes?
You out of your mind?
- l think that's pretty clear.
- l'm so sick of that.
Oh, really?
I think it's cute.
Since you won't be treating us to one of your incompetent tap routines...
- ...why don't you take those things off?
- No.
We'll do the routine.
Rose.
- Madge wants to see the routine.
- l don't want to see your routine.
- l asked you to take those off.
- We need a break.
Just briefly, please.
It's helpful to have an audience.
Rose, the music.
I'm gonna report you.
Suzanne.
For me, it'd be Madame Curie, Simone de Beauvoir...
- ...and Margaret Sanger.
- Good.
Violet.
I would say Richard Strauss, Roderick Charleston and Chubbard Checker.
- Richard Strauss?
The composer?
- Yes, that was one of his posts.
I'm not familiar with the others.
Could you tell us who they are?
Yes.
Each one of these men started an international dance craze.
Richard Strauss, the waltz.
Roderick Charleston, the Charleston.
Chubbard Checker, known as Chubby the dance we know as the twist.
Why do you consider a dance craze important?
Dance crazes enhance and elevate the human experience bringing together millions of people in a joyous celebration of our God-given faculties and passing these modes of physical expression down through the generations.
Though not so much anymore.
I thought-- Well, I assumed that the Charleston was named after the city of Charleston.
No.
Though that misconception is quite widely held.
It was Roderick Charleston.
Usually, behind some great creative phenomenon there's a person, not a town.
This is so exciting.
It's really great, isn't it?
- Hey, could you guys help?
- Sure.
What's up?
We need help packing soap which we'll distribute to Doar Dorm residents.
Cool.
What would you say are effective means to fight depression?
Maybe some of your DU brothers have an idea?
- Beer?
- No.
Beer's a downer.
Cocktails.
Hard liquor and spirits is what really gives you a lift.
It's interesting what you say.
My cousin Jay is a medical officer in Philadelphia.
He says that alcoholism by which I mean chronic, excessive consumption of alcohol is the primary self-administered treatment for depression.
- Cool.
- No.
It leaves you much worse off than before.
Oh, no, not me.
I just boot and then I feel fine.
- By "boot" do you mean vomit?
- Yes.
No.
None of the effective anti-suicide treatments involve vomiting.
- Hygiene?
- Exactly.
It's very important.
That's why we have such hope in the wonder bar.
Do you know its scent?
Transformative, we think.
This is so exciting.
When should we go over there?
- l don't think there's any rush.
- l'd like to go soon.
Doar Dorm has the highest fatality rate, as well as the worst hygiene.
Highest suicide rate.
Fatality rate. lt's uncertain what percentage were intentional and how many were just due to unawareness of gravity's laws.
I can just see those guys getting the gold packages, opening them and finding the good-smelling soap inside.
The cute packaging should prove irresistible.
And once clean, they'll start to see the world with new eyes.
The change could be dramatic.
Doar Dorm could soon become Dior Dorm.
I doubt that, to be perfectly, absolutely honest.
I love the idea.
Dior Dorm.
I adore optimism, even when it's completely absurd.
- Perhaps especially then.
- Great.
Ready?
Let's go.
Let's hurry.
Let's not get our hopes up too high, Heather.
No, you said yourself, the wonder bar is transformative.
- Hey, Violet.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Where you going?
- Doar Dorm.
- Fred, hi.
- Hey.
Good one.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
I guess it wasn't realistic to expect Doar Dorm to turn into Dior Dorm overnight.
They wouldn't even open them.
They said without the soap, the discs wouldn't fly properly.
Are you coming Friday?
Violet's launching her dance craze.
Oh, really?
That's great.
- What's the dance?
- The Sambola.
The devil's dance.
- Oh, cool.
We'll go, right?
- Yes, I'd like to.
But I have several papers to finish.
But I'd like to.
Great.
Thanks, Gus.
I don't see how we're going to start a dance craze if no guys show up.
Most guys aren't very good with the dance-craze thing.
Very good news. I was just in my procrastination seminar and the two guys from Doar Dorm had showered.
It was clear they'd used soap.
Oh, my gosh, what a difference.
Seems they'd been throwing packages so energetically, a soap bar fell out.
The unfamiliar ivory-like object intrigued them and one thing led to another, and, well.... lt was just as you said.
Isn't that great?
- Oh, look, here's Jimbo.
- Jimbo doesn't count.
Where is everybody?
Aren't we gonna be late for Violet's dance craze?
You wanna go to that?
Yeah.
- You're kidding.
- No, I love dance crazes.
Gosh, you're strange.
But aren't we already late?
No, it's later on.
Like 10, I think.
I have to confess, I've started losing patience with Violet.
Depression calls for serious treatment.
Medication.
Psychopharmaceuticals.
Talk therapy.
Are those approaches effective?
Despite the medication and therapy Ed School students are still throwing themselves off Robertson Hall.
Violet's ideas might seem a little offbeat--
A little?
Oh, my God. I don't know how much you know about Violet but there's some pretty weird stuff.
You know, Violet.
Violet Wister.
It's not even her real name.
- lt isn't?
- No, it's Emily Tweeter.
When she was 11, she went completely crazy and has had several relapses since.
So it's a little worrisome to have her counsel nearly suicidal individuals.
I can't believe it.
- What?
- Emily Tweeter.
In first grade, I had an enormous crush on a girl with that name.
- And you remember that?
- Yeah.
Pretty huge Dr. Zhivago stuff.
Any idea or even mention of her filled me with emotion.
I had a strange perspective on the world.
I don't think my brain was functioning properly.
Everything was a bit of a dream.
You think this was Violet?
You have any idea if Violet attended willamette Montessori?
In Portland?
- We didn't order these.
- Compliments of the guy at the bar.
It was so brutal how it ended between us.
I know I was too angry and a bit crazy but I thought that what we had was stronger than that.
That you would not just walk away after one disagreement.
It wasn't just that.
You mean my Cathar beliefs.
Well I am no longer a Cathar.
How is that possible?
It's been very difficult.
You've dropped your adherence to the Cathar faith?
- Yes, I have.
- Good.
Normally I'd be reluctant to comment on anyone's religion, but....
What?
I'm sorry. I guess-- l guess I'm a bit of a bigot. I just-- l could never take seriously any religion that worships on Tuesdays.
Major religions require worship on the weekend.
Friday, Saturday or Sunday.
I find it just really laudatory that people sacrifice their weekend time to worship God.
Having the Sabbath on Tuesday always seemed very bizarre to me.
It's not right.
You know what?
We'd better get to the Lone Star.
Why are you so concerned about that?
Well, it's not as if international dance crazes start every day.
We'd better hurry.
What's wrong?
Another fiasco.
Sometimes our struggle reminds me of the myth of Sisyphus.
- Who?
- The myth about the guy who pushes an enormous rock only to have it keep rolling back.
Oh, yeah.
What a knucklehead.
The important thing to remember is that he was mythical.
He never really existed.
Violet?
Did you spend any part of your education at Willamette Montessori?
In Oregon?
Why?
Sound like "tweaker."
Would you say today is very gray?
I'd say so.
Maybe blue-gray.
Yeah, no, that rings a bell now.
Bye.
I'm sorry.
Her name wasn't Emily Tweeter, but Lucy Wurlitzer.
They're not similar. I'm beginning to realize that the human memory is not the foolproof instrument we sometimes imagine.
What's worse, everyone knew about my obsession, including my parents those from whom I most wanted it kept.
So from your earliest years, you were already a playboy or operator type?
Yes. I suppose that's why secrecy seemed so desirable.
Violet, can we talk?
- What's the plural of doofus?
- Doufi.
Not doofuses?
You can say either.
"Doufi" respects the Latin root and is preferred.
"Doofuses" is also correct, although a bit inelegant.
- You've thought a lot about this.
- Yes, I've had to.
Why?
What is it?
I like Fred, he's a nice guy.
And I can see why you like him.
When I first met you and Rose, I thought you were the cool crowd.
And in many ways you are. I find your perfume and fashion sense excellent.
Thank you.
But there's a reason, I think why you are so strongly attracted to doufi.
And it's not an accident how different groups divide up.
Isn't that a rainbow?
- That's a rainbow!
- Thor.
No, Thor!
Thor, no!
Stop!
Please, stop!
He's headed for Robertson Hall!
Red.
Orange.
Yellow.
Green.
Blue. Indigo.
Hallelujah!
Lord God, thank you.
Education.
Education.
We can learn the subjects we set out to master no matter how hard or impossible they may seem.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I wasn't sure I was gonna make it.
Magenta.
Pink.
Mauve.
I miss my nice American friend.
No, you're mistaken.
- You go to London for four weeks?
- Six.
It's dangerous, parents letting children travel.
They send them off and they don't know what they'll be getting back.
I don't know what you're referring to.
You're not from London.
I'm from London.
I was there, now I'm here.
I'm from London.
I just miss my nice American friend.
Nice?
Nice?
Fine. I'm fine.
Those are not adjectives I like to use.
God gave us abilities.
He requires that we use them.
Good, better, best, excelsior, higher.
Only excellence can glorify the Lord.
Vulgarity is, in essence, blasphemous.
I'm sorry for what I was saying before.
Of course you're not linked to the doufi or even that such distinctions are valid.
No, don't apologize.
I probably do have a doufi orientation.
But behind coolness, isn't there a certain repressing squashing down, or lack of cultivation of one's humanity?
Oh, so you think that cool people have less humanity?
No, I don't think cool people are entirely inhuman.
Just enough to be cool.
In our society, there's all this propaganda in favor of uniqueness, eccentricity, et cetera.
But does the world really want or need more of such traits?
Aren't such people usually terrible pains in the neck?
What the world needs to work properly is a large mass of normal people.
I would like to be one of those.
Sorry.
But you'll still do the part?
Yeah, of course.
So do you know every number...
- ...in every Fred Astaire movie?
- There were two in our school musical.
- l know those.
- Did performing those two numbers help you overcome feelings of discouragement and despair?
Absolutely.
Freak.
Hey, everybody, let's do the Sambola.
Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET
- Look.
- Where?
There.
Yes. I think so.
Hello.
Are you a new student?
- Yes.
- Good.
We thought so.
We'd like to help you.
Help me?
What do you mean?
As a freshman, it can be very tough.
You get to college and it's supposed to be great, but it's not.
University life can be pretty bad.
- There are a lot of suicides.
- Well, attempted ones.
I'm not actually a freshman.
I'm a transfer student.
- Oh, an entering sophomore?
- Yes.
You were unhappy and are looking to recover here.
- Well, I think you will.
- Yes.
Would you welcome that?
Would our help be something you'd appreciate?
Or would you rather sink or swim on your own?
- Either way is fine.
We'll be friends.
- Yes, whichever you'd prefer.
Yes.
Sure.
Great.
We should start immediately.
Clothes can be crucial for confidence and an overall sense of well-being.
- Clothes don't have to be expensive.
- You need friends of the same size.
- You don't like my clothes?
- l'm just saying.
Move it out.
What?
What's wrong?
- What's wrong?
- You didn't notice that?
- No.
What?
- Those guys.
That smell.
That awful, acrid odor.
Have you heard of nasal shock syndrome?
Any harsh, acrid or just disgusting odor sends Rose into nasal shock.
Just from some BO?
"Just some BO"?
Oh, my God, Lily.
You must have a very high threshold for pain.
That'll serve you well at Seven Oaks.
- What do you mean?
- Seven Oaks is notorious for its BO.
It was the last of the Select Seven to go coed.
An atmosphere of male barbarism predominates...
- ...but we're going to change that.
- Yes.
Where are you going?
Gotta get to the Housing Department.
They lost my rooming assignment.
That's terrible.
You have no place to stay?
Was it just mislaid?
No, there were more acceptances than they anticipated and not enough rooms to go around, so....
Why don't you stay with us?
Really?
Don't think of this in the old-fashioned sense of going to a party to find someone or not find someone.
That's not the dynamic that we're talking about.
- What dynamic are you talking about?
- Glad you asked.
Our going to a party of this kind is more a form of youth outreach.
- Of what?
- Youth outreach.
It's not just some moronic frat-house social function.
Though it will be that too.
We've gotta keep in mind that these guys are young people.
They're essentially immature and crying out for help and guidance.
- Though they don't know it.
- No, they don't, but we do.
- Aren't they the same age as we are?
- Only numerically.
I'm a lot fatter than you are, but I think we could pin it.
Oh, my gosh, that's beautiful.
Stunning.
Take Frank, my friend.
He's not some cool, handsome, studly macho type.
No, not at all.
I can't stand guys like that.
He's more of a sad sack really, wouldn't you say?
- Definitely.
- What is a sad sack?
A loser.
- You like losers?
- Very much so.
Do you know what's the major problem in social life?
What?
The tendency, widespread, to always seek someone cooler than yourself.
It's always a stretch.
Often a big stretch.
Why not find someone who's inferior?
- Someone like Frank.
- Yes. lt's more rewarding.
And, in fact, quite reassuring.
You mean someone you can help, not just thinking of yourself.
Yes, that's it, precisely.
But without the goody-goody implications.
Our aspirations are pretty basic.
Take a guy who hasn't realized his full potential or doesn't even have much and then help him realize it or find more.
There's enough material here for a lifetime of social work.
What's really worrisome is that that was intentional.
Frank.
Frank, this is Lily.
She's just come to Seven Oaks as a transfer student. lsn't she great?
Lily failed or wasn't happy at her last school.
We're sure that she's going to adapt here.
- ln fact, she already has.
- Oh, good.
Oh, my God.
A golden oldie.
I love these.
- Oh, my gosh.
Wasn't that great?
- That was really fun.
I know that people can have useful careers in many areas.
Medicine, government, law, finance.
- Education.
- Yes, even education.
But I'd like to do something especially significant in my lifetime.
That could change the course of human history.
- Such as starting a new dance craze.
- Really?
Yes.
Something that could improve the lives of every person and every couple.
I'm so proud of what you accomplished last night.
You showed those guys a really good time.
Without anything really bad happening.
That's good.
The guys you know, are they all Greeks?
- What?
- Are all the guys you know Greeks?
Excuse me. I don't understand.
Are all the guys you know Greeks?
- l don't think we know any Greeks.
- Greeks, like frat boys.
Oh, yes.
Fraternities.
You mean members of the Greek-letter fraternities.
Yeah.
Like last night.
Actually, last night we were at the DU house.
DU.
Roman letters.
Not Greek.
Seven Oaks has never had a Greek-letter fraternity system.
It's always been a Roman-letter system here.
It's very different.
- What house is this?
- Oh, this isn't a fraternity.
At least not one anyone should want to join.
You probably think we're frivolous, empty-headed college coeds.
You're probably right.
I often feel empty-headed.
We're trying to make a difference in people's lives.
One way to do that is to stop them from killing themselves.
Have you ever heard of "Prevention is nine-tenths the cure"?
Well, in the case of suicide, it's actually 1 0-tenths the cure.
- Those are clichés, aren't they?
- Yes, they are.
It's interesting you say that. I love clichés and hackneyed expressions.
- Do you know why?
- No.
Because they're largely true.
The hundreds, perhaps thousands of such clichés and hackneyed expressions that our language has bequeathed us are a stunning treasure trove of human insight and knowledge.
- Really?
- Yes.
Oh, please sit down.
During these formative college years we should learn as many clichéd and hackneyed thoughts as possible.
Furthermore, I think we will.
Speaking of suicide prevention, do you have a boyfriend, Lily?
- Are you dating anyone?
- l don't see the connection.
- You don't?
- Boyfriends are a primary suicide risk.
You don't have any particular friend?
No one at all?
No.
Well, there's this grad student I met over summer.
Xavier.
We became pretty good pals.
He has a girlfriend whom I've met.
She's very nice.
"Zavier." With a Z?
- No, I think it's with an X.
- No, I'm certain it's Z.
Zavier, like Zorro.
It's the same sound.
Zorro marked his name with a Z.
It's an X.
But Zorro's with a Z.
Okay, let me see if I can figure this out.
Used at the beginning of a name, Z and X have the same pronunciation.
- But it's Zorro with a Z.
- Actually, there were two Zorros.
One spelled his name with a Z and made a Z mark for Zorro.
And there's Xorro who spelled his name with an X and with his sword he'd make an X mark.
What was really unfair was because he marked his name with X everybody assumed he was illiterate when he was spelling correctly.
- Hello.
- Can we help you?
Of course we can.
No case is too challenging.
- Would you like a doughnut?
- Okay.
Please, sit down.
- Here, have some coffee.
- Thank you.
- What's your name?
- Jim Bose.
- But my friends call me Jimbo.
- Why?
- What?
- Why do your friends call you Jimbo?
Well, it's a contraction of Jim and the first part of my last name, Bose.
Yeah, I got that.
But why bother?
- What do you mean?
- Jim is already a lovely name.
It's short, simple, evocative.
Shouldn't a nickname simplify the name that it replaces?
Jimbo doesn't really simplify anything.
I don't know.
Well, maybe you should ask your friends.
Where do you live or reside?
Doar Dorm.
- Oh, my God.
Yuck.
- What?
- The smell, it's notorious.
- What smell?
You're right, it's more like a stink.
Unclean clothing, I'd say, mostly.
- Vomit.
- Stale beer.
Pot.
Cheap deodorant.
There might be a vermin infestation.
Did you know a good-smelling environment is crucial to our sense of well-being?
Have you tried to find a better-smelling place?
Wait, wait.
It's not me, I'm not depressed.
- You're not?
- No.
Are you sure?
You kind of seem on edge.
- No, I'm fine.
- That's a terrible expression. "Fine."
"l'm fine."
Something smug about it. "l'm fine."
- Why do you say that you're fine?
- l'm not depressed. I'm not suicidal.
Why are you here, then?
Are you a con man?
- A confidence trickster?
- No, there's a girl.
Her boyfriend dumped her.
She was crying but now is silent.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you say so?
We have to go.
Call the cops!
A suicide might be in progress!
- The campus cops?
- Yes, of course the campus cops.
Take this.
We have a lot of students coming to the center pretending to be depressed to get doughnuts.
- Confidence tricksters.
- Yes, it's really bad.
Really cynical.
We pledged to the doughnut company we would only give doughnuts to students who were depressed or otherwise nutty.
We're a nonprofit, so the rules are pretty strict.
- This man could still be a trickster.
- Well, we'll soon find out.
Tell me about this girl.
Well, her name is Priss.
She's very pretty.
Oh, yes. lt's very hard for beautiful women to experience rejection.
Priss?
Priss.
Are you okay?
Priss!
Priss, say something!
Priss!
Open up!
Oh, thank God.
We're gonna have to force this door.
Priss?
Are you okay?
- What?
- Please don't.
Please, come with us.
Do you wanna talk about it?
What was his name?
Josh.
If you'd rather not talk, we don't have to.
No, it's okay, I just....
l keep thinking how he used to gaze at me with such love in his eyes.
You know what I mean?
No.
No, I've never actually seen that.
Yes.
Just days ago, he'd gaze at me.
His eyes, so blue.
He had blue eyes?
So does Frank.
Frank's the guy that I go out with.
Otherwise, he's not conventionally good-looking, which I actually prefer.
Would you describe Josh as handsome?
- That's a problem.
- Could I join you guys?
Yes, please.
Priss and I were just talking.
In my view, handsome men are to be avoided.
I don't even consider good looks to be flattering in a man.
- Do you know what I mean?
- No.
Cookie-cutter, good-looking guys, with their chiseled features running around, full of themselves getting everything they want, never suffering or experiencing--
We suffered?
We're not under discussion.
That's irrelevant.
That's besides the point.
- ls this making you feel any better?
- Yes. I think so.
Good. I hoped it would.
Okay, it's nearly 4 and The Daily Complainer's orientation meeting is about to start and I think we should go.
The editor, Rick DeWolfe, he's terrible.
A real jerk.
Why do you think he's such a jerk?
He's one of those that I was talking about.
Tall.
Probably considers himself very smart and handsome.
A journalist, so you can imagine the mindboggling arrogance and conceit.
- But, Violet, don't you think--?
- What?
Well, don't you think that the way you talk could be considered arrogant too?
I mean, a little?
Yes, of course.
But what's your point?
Wouldn't that be hypocritical, criticizing Rick for something you could be criticized for yourself?
No. I don't see why.
We're all flawed.
Must that render us mute to the flaws of others?
Must we tether ourselves from comment because our natures are human too?
We've got a rebel amongst us.
That's good, I think. lt's good to be challenged and criticized.
I know your intentions are good, it's just--
That's it precisely.
Our intentions are good.
We're seeking to help people rescue their lives from terrible sadness and failure which is a worthy goal, don't you think?
Yes.
But not exactly a humble one.
No.
I agree with you there.
You're right, absolutely.
I'd like to thank you for this chastisement.
- l'm sorry, I didn't mean to chastise.
- No, I think you did and I think it's good.
It's good to have a friend to put one in one's place when that's what one needs.
Now I see that I have that kind of friend in you.
I think that's great.
Hello, people.
Listen up.
People, quiet.
Quiet, people.
Shut up!
Okay, that's better. I'm Rick DeWolfe, editor of The Complainer.
Over the next weeks, I'm the person you're gonna hate most in the world.
You're gonna hate me because I'm gonna work you point out your stupidity and incompetence and do everything in my power to turn you into journalists.
- Albeit barely literate ones.
- Oh, brother.
Any questions?
No?
Yes.
How did The Daily Complainer get its name?
Isn't that pretty obvious?
It comes out every day and it's the university daily.
So The Daily Complainer.
- The Daily--
- No, I meant--
Oh, you mean, why The Complainer?
The name dates from Seven Oaks' earliest days as a divinity school.
The reference is to the Book of Job.
Job's complaint with the world.
Before justice can be achieved, a complaint must be made.
That is what we do and people don't like it a bit.
Right now, what that means is extirpating Seven Oaks' elitist Roman Letter Clubs that are like a cancer on the community.
They're not elitist in the least.
Yes, they are.
Have you met any of their members?
The guys from the DU, for example?
They're barely competent for the tasks of everyday life.
They have to drink a quart of beer just to talk to a woman?
- Two quarts.
- Yet you salivate at the idea of taking the roof off their heads and throwing them on the street where who knows what would happen.
You call yourself a Christian.
- No, I don't.
- What unkindness and cruelty.
This is the darkness in the heart of man, which Joseph Conrad wrote about most eloquently.
- He was actually Polish.
- Oh, my God.
Unkind, self-righteous and pedantic.
In short, a model journalist.
You should know something about these girls.
They run the suicide center where their preferred therapy for depressed and suicidal people is tap dancing.
- l kid you not.
- Tap is a highly effective therapy as well as a dazzlingly expressive dance form that has been sadly neglected for too many years.
It's moronic and barbaric.
You expect tap dancing to solve people's problems?
No, we don't.
We're using the whole range of musical dance numbers which have proven themselves to be effective therapies for the suicidal and the hopelessly depressed.
That really got me down.
- l thought you handled it well.
- You did?
Thanks.
No, it's all this aggression and hostility that gets me down.
Not just his but also my own.
It leaves you feeling unclean.
Have you thought of taking a shower?
Maybe you'd feel better.
You're probably right.
No, there's something else.
What Lily was saying about me being conceited and arrogant.
- l'm sorry.
- No, I think you're right.
I'm really ashamed.
- You're joking.
- No, it's terrible how I've acted.
We're all Christians.
Or I should say Judeo-Christians.
Humility should be our watchword.
The essence of being a good person.
Humility comes from within.
If it's not there in the first place, where do you go to get it?
I stopped looking a long time ago.
Very good, Freak.
- You really think so?
- Yes.
Certainly.
- Five, six, seven, eight.
- Violet.
is it such a good idea to call him Freak?
What?
He's already depressed and you're calling him Freak.
That's his name.
Freak.
Freak Astaire.
That's how he wants to be called.
What are you talking about?
Lily was just saying she likes your dancing.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Are you okay?
What do you mean?
I thought you looked sad and was wondering...
- ...if there was anything we could do.
- What could you do?
Oh, I know.
You think I'm gonna kill myself and make you look bad.
No, I'm worried that you'll kill yourself and make yourself look bad.
Do you have any idea how demoralizing it is to be constantly questioned about whether you're suicidal or not?
No.
After a while, you wonder, why is everyone asking me this?
They want me to be suicidal?
Or is it just the consequence of your utter absurdity?
Excuse me.
What scent are you wearing?
- What are you talking about?
- The perfume you're wearing.
I'm not wearing any perfume!
You see, that could be the problem.
- l've become friends with a group.
- Really?
- Although they're perfume-obsessed.
- Oh, them?
Those girls?
The ones who volunteer at the center?
- Yeah.
- But they're terrible.
The blond one?
She's notorious.
- What do you mean?
- Such a bitch.
Terrible, isn't she?
- Would balsamic be okay?
- What?
Balsamic vinegar.
For the dressing.
Yeah, sure.
- What's that?
- What?
- Those.
- Artichokes?
is that what they look like?
Come on, Lily.
You've seen an artichoke before.
- You haven't?
- They look so weird.
I'm not convinced that having a suicide-prevention center prevents any suicides.
Well, the coffee's good.
If someone were determined to destroy themselves...
- ...
I don't think they'd stop for coffee.
- lt depends on what it tastes like.
- Where are we going?
- l thought I'd take Priss over to DU.
Why?
It might be helpful for her to meet some of the guys.
How would that be helpful?
They're morons.
- Oh, come on, Lily.
- No, they're morons.
No.
Not medically. I like them.
They're in that sympathetic range of being not good-looking and yet not smart.
There's something likable about that.
Spending time with them, you get the sense that you're making a difference.
For somebody suicidal, like Priss, that could be a real boost.
- l'm not suicidal.
- Oh, that's good.
It's better not to have an identity as a suicidal person, don't you think?
- Well, bye.
- Well....
- Where are you going?
- Over to Xavier's.
- ls that a good idea?
- Why wouldn't it be?
- ls his girlfriend gonna be there?
- Of course.
- Gosh, you're nosy.
- No, no, it's just a general foreboding.
"Foreboding"?
You know, you're absolutely right.
I was being nosy.
Terribly so.
- l've gotta watch that.
- Yes, we must improve ourselves.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
Lily.
- You were coming over?
- Hey.
Yeah. ls Alice home?
Alice is working.
- Oh, she is?
- But it's not a problem.
It's good you came.
Let's go to the Oak Bar.
I'll buy you a beer.
- l thought Alice would be back.
- l'll call her.
She'll join us there.
Come on.
Okay.
She's actually quite a good person.
Her entire identity revolves around helping people.
You really think that's true?
What's she have against The Complainer?
That's bizarre.
Well, she thinks the editor, Rick DeWolfe, is completely egotistical.
And your friend isn't?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi, Lily.
- Hi.
- Great.
You got the message.
- Yeah.
- Who's egotistical?
- Lily's roommate.
She sounds unbearable.
She's on a rampage against The Complainer.
Really?
Why?
She thinks the editor, Rick DeWolfe, is conceited.
- And, in fact, quite mean.
- Mean?
Yes.
He wants to close the Seven Oaks Roman Letter Clubs.
That's good, isn't it?
Everyone was against them.
- No.
- Come on.
There's no justification for those places.
They're exclusive and elitist.
The point that Violet makes is that they can't be elitist.
- They're morons.
- Yeah, elitist morons.
You'll grant they're morons.
That's a handicap.
Such people should be helped, not hounded and persecuted.
- Persecuted?
- Yes, losing the roof over your head?
That's the worst thing that can happen.
Violet thinks there could be some risk of suicide.
Because some boy might kill himself, Seven Oaks can't do what's right?
It's a factor to be considered.
- Yeah.
- No, it isn't.
You can't set policy that way.
- Excuse me, we didn't order these.
- Compliments of the guy at the bar.
That's a playboy or operator move.
Operators like that are to be avoided.
Why?
It seems generous, sending drinks to people you don't know.
- Drinks are expensive.
- Drinks to two gorgeous girls.
His intention was to seduce and he assumed he could.
- Both?
- That seems a bit harsh.
You don't know what he was thinking.
Was he alone?
Yes.
You see?
He was alone and probably lonely.
He could see that Alice and Lily were students.
Students are known for their intelligent conversation.
They can always talk about their courses.
That was probably what attracted him.
Nonsense.
Perhaps his view was even loftier.
To court Lily with a view to matrimony.
We're in the north, but a southern gentleman can wander into these parts.
Rubbish.
Seeing Lily across a crowded bar filled with the usual undergraduate slobs.
Why wouldn't a thoughtful young man seek her out?
She's lovely.
Isn't it incumbent on men and women to find ways to meet each other?
Buying drinks for a person you don't know seems to be a generous one.
Yes.
Most guys won't even pay for the women they do know.
What you've described is a playboy or operator move.
I'll grant you that it's a tactic or perhaps even a ruse but without some of that, would our species even survive?
The Lord said, "Be fruitful and multiply."
Oh, my gosh.
No, this is how the world works, seeing someone across a room.
This could be the romantic story you tell your grandchildren.
And if you do marry and have children then he'll really learn how to squander cash.
Isn't it good to know that he's basically generous from the start?
Where's Priss?
Your eyes are so striking.
So blue.
- Really?
They're blue?
- Yes.
The most piercing blue.
You must know your eyes are blue.
- No.
- What do you mean?
What?
You must know what color your eyes are.
Your eyes are very blue.
You know that.
I'm not gonna go around checking what color my eyes are.
When you look in the mirror, you see that your eyes are blue.
- Oh, come on.
- What?
I don't think my eyes have a color.
If my eyes are so blue looking out, wouldn't everything be kind of blue?
Like, have a bluish tinge to it?
Doesn't.
Just looks normal.
That's...?
That's blue?
- That color?
- Yes, of course.
Then what color is that?
Green.
You're saying that chair's green but Frank's eyes are blue?
Yes.
Then what color are the walls?
Also green.
You didn't know that?
No.
How's that possible?
You think knowing the colors is so important?
You're in college and you don't know the colors?
Doesn't that embarrass you?
Well, no.
Why should it?
That's why the 'rents are paying big bucks to send me here.
You know, to learn stuff.
Well, gotta go hit the books.
I don't think anyone should feel embarrassed about not knowing stuff.
What's embarrassing is pretending to know.
Or putting people down because you think they don't know as much.
Look, I'm happy to admit I'm completely ignorant.
That's why I'm here and plan to really hit the books.
So the next time you see me, I will know more than I do now.
I'll be older but also wiser.
Or at least know more stuff.
For me, that's education.
Cheers.
Thor's great.
He's very clear about his objectives.
He really wants to learn things.
Frank?
What a jerk.
- He's a monster.
- Oh, my gosh, Violet.
You did everything for them.
They're nothing without you.
- What a rat.
- He's a moron.
- Don't waste a tear on that creep.
- Don't waste a single breath.
- Jerk.
- Stop.
- Please.
- What?
I love Frank.
I love him.
Come on, Violet, Frank's a moron.
You are well rid of him.
- Don't say that.
- Frank's not a moron?
You know, Lily, you're a bit harsh.
This obsession with intelligence.
Do you think it has some magical quality transforming everything?
The intelligence line is not an immutable barrier.
Love can cross it.
You can love someone whose mental capacity is not large.
I know. I have.
- Well, there's a mutable barrier, then.
- Frank's stupid, we knew.
That he's a rat playboy operator, I hadn't realized.
I don't want to turn bitter.
- l worry for Frank. I care about him.
- Well, I'd stop.
No.
I love Frank.
I always will.
If that's the case, why not fight for him?
- Against Priss?
I'd never win.
- Sure you would.
Priss is a rat.
A bitch.
A rat bitch.
Don't blame Priss.
She was crushed when her blue-eyed Josh left her.
I should've known.
Of course she'd fall for Frank.
Josh and Frank are both blue-eyed heartbreakers.
Poor Violet.
She's the roommate who's so self-confident?
Yeah.
But now she's a wreck.
But there's no logic to the algebra of love.
"The algebra of love."
That sounds like the title to some lame book.
It's a title, but the book's not lame at all.
Love's algebra?
I thought it was more geometry.
Okay, the title's not good, but the book is.
What's it say?
Well, that while we're all perverse in our romantic preferences there's actually this logic or algebra to our perversity and it has something to do with how the species has evolved.
- The survival of the species?
- Yes.
And whether it will continue to do so.
No booze?
Just to find the nearest package store, you had to drive 40 miles.
- These aren't so strong.
- No, they're really strong.
I think I'd like another.
- That wouldn't be a good idea.
- Why not?
- Well....
- Are you trying to stifle me?
- Lily?
- Oh, hi.
Listen, we're gonna get something to eat.
Why don't you come with us?
- l'm with Charlie.
- l can see that.
- But you really should come.
- Why?
I just think it would be a good idea.
- But why?
- You really must come. I insist.
Lily?
Lily, are you angry?
Lily, this is it.
We're here.
What's the matter?
That was so rude.
He's a nice guy and you embarrassed him.
He's not nice.
He was trying to get you drunk.
- No, he wasn't.
- Plying you with martinis?
- l was plying myself with martinis.
- Come on, the guy's a total sleaze.
- A creep.
- You don't know anything about him.
The way he sent drinks over to our table?
Alice.
Alice, what's wrong?
I had no idea that Xavier could be so mean.
Sounds as if he was just trying to protect you.
This Charlie Walker sounds like an operator or playboy type.
No, he's not like that.
He's actually a really nice guy.
I thought he was a slick businessman.
No.
He dresses well, but he works in strategic development.
- What?
- Strategic development.
He works at SDA.
Strategic Development Associates.
- He's an associate there.
- What he is, is a strategic operator.
Violet, are you okay?
Hey, miss, rain's coming!
Better get back!
- Polly, have you seen Violet?
- No. ls something wrong?
We're not sure.
Violet!
- Violet!
- Violet!
Oh, my gosh, what happened?
I don't understand.
What were you doing?
How long were you gone for?
I'm sorry, I don't know.
I lost track of time.
But you feel better now?
Well, cleaner.
She'll say anything to get in the show.
- She'll want doughnuts.
- You don't have to be suicidal...
- ...to get doughnuts, just depressed.
- Clinically depressed.
From a clinic.
- Would you say you're depressed?
- l don't like the term.
- l prefer to say I'm in a tailspin.
- Oh, my God.
A tailspin?
She can't even say she's depressed.
She's gotta say something special.
Priss was honest.
She was depressed and she had a right to be in the show.
Now every silly tailspinner's trying to get in.
- The show is for everyone.
- No, it isn't, Freak.
To be in the center's programs, you have to be clinically depressed.
That means that you've been to a clinic and they've said that you're depressed.
Have you been to a clinic?
Have you been to a clinic?
Then you're not clinically depressed.
Violet.
Violet.
What is it?
Where are you going?
All I wanted was to make Frank happy.
I had all these plans.
Things we could've done together.
I never even got to tell him.
Hey!
Where all your boyfriends at?
Come on!
They don't wear bikinis.
They're ladies, they wear thongs.
I can't imagine where she could've gone.
Wherever she went, she should be back by now.
How did she seem when you last saw her?
Really sad about Frank.
- Still?
- Yeah.
How can someone so smart continue mooning over a dope like that?
People aren't exactly as you assume.
The Violet you know bears little resemblance to the girl I met in seventh grade.
- You met Violet in seventh grade?
- Well, her name wasn't Violet then.
What's your name?
You can tell us your name.
We won't bite.
What's your name?
Tell us.
Are you retarded?
Tell us your name.
Emily Tweeter.
- Tweeter?
Like a bird?
- That's ridiculous.
Tweeter?
Like a bird?
- Not an easy name to have at that age.
- Not at any age.
What was she like?
Timid.
Bookish.
Classic scholarship student.
Her parents were writers.
They didn't have a dime.
Finances were the least of her worries.
- What do you mean?
- Well, she was crazy.
I got stuck rooming with her on a trip when no one else would.
- lt was awful.
- Did she smell bad?
No.
Obsessive cleanliness was part of her insanity.
- You were nice to her.
- No.
The idea of being nice to weird kids hadn't arrived.
- Why was she so unpopular?
- Well, she was very strange.
Constantly setting herself odd, repetitive tasks.
Tasks?
For example, on that trip she had with her a little square suitcase.
The idea came into her head she had to move it in a precise pattern over and over again and if she didn't execute this movement flawlessly 10 times she'd start over.
Another was to slide her hand across her forehead trying not to touch her hair or eyebrows on either side also repeating it 10 times.
Any niggling thought she'd touched the hair, she'd start over.
- My God, that is insane.
- Why would she do that?
She had the conviction that if she didn't complete these tasks her parents would die.
- Was she Catholic?
- No.
But what made the whole thing really sad was that her parents did die.
Oh, my God.
Violet!
Violet?
Violet!
Violet, where are you?
Something's wrong, isn't it, dear?
You mind my asking?
Well, I do mind a little.
- Excuse me, Your Highness.
- l'm sorry.
- lt's just kind of awkward to talk about.
- No matter.
I hope you haven't come to get run over on the highway.
- What do you mean?
- Suicides.
They come down from the university.
Jump out in the road.
Get hit by the blind curve.
Hope you're not one of them.
Do I look like one of them?
I don't know.
Maybe.
Messy people, suicides.
Think only of themselves and their own deaths.
Not what comes after.
They leave quite a mess.
They don't stick around to clean it up.
So you're not one of those depressed students from the university?
I don't like the word "depressed." l prefer to say that I'm in a tailspin.
A tailspin?
- Does this tailspin involve a man?
- Yes, it does.
But I'm not as crazy as I was up till yesterday.
Apparently that's due to the salutary effect of scent on the human psyche.
Its importance is, I believe, almost incalculable.
At the motel, I happened to use this soap.
It was provided to me as a courtesy as one of the guests.
That an economical motel would provide such good soap is quite unusual.
- The scent is very precise.
- Really?
Tell me if it provokes any particular reaction in your psyche.
A state of mind.
I always knew she was unstable.
They're gonna have her photo at the registrar's.
Violet!
Violet!
You're back!
You're okay!
Not really.
Oh, my gosh, Violet, we were so worried.
Why didn't you tell us or leave a note?
I did leave a note.
Would that be a suicide note?
- l wouldn't leave without a note.
- Where did you go?
I took the train to Villafranca and checked into a motel there.
- The Motel 6?
- No, the Motel 4.
- lt's even less expensive.
- The Motel 4 in Villafranca?
- My God, you really were suicidal.
- Why'd you go?
I had to do something.
And you really thought you were gonna find the answer in Villafranca?
I'm not sure what I expected, but I might have found it.
What?
Soap?
This scent and this soap is what gives me hope.
Hello?
is anyone here?
Hello?
Lily?
- Hello?
- Oh, my gosh.
I couldn't understand where everyone was.
Sorry, I just went out to get some things.
- Where's Alice?
- Gone.
What do you mean?
Left.
We broke up.
- But when you called, you said-- - l know, I'm sorry.
I thought it better to tell you in person.
Alice couldn't control her jealousy.
It completely overwhelmed her.
Really?
What was she jealous of?
Come on.
No, what?
You.
After a while, I just couldn't handle it.
Things became impossible.
She was jealous of me?
Of course.
Would it be okay if we watch a film?
Yes.
What would you like to see?
I thought maybe Truffaut's Baisers volés.
Stolen Kisses.
Do you know it?
No, is it new?
It's a classic of French New Wave cinema.
I think you'll like it.
- But it's in color?
- Yeah.
- You don't know Truffaut?
- No.
Do you know Godard, Á bout de souffle?
- Why was Alice so jealous?
- What do you think?
She was jealous because Lily's lovely.
I don't know.
They had a lot of problems.
Of course.
You wouldn't break up a happy couple.
- What's that?
- A note Frank left.
- Really?
Recently?
- No, when we were together.
Now that most correspondence is electronic it's rare to be left anything written by hand.
Frank can write by hand?
- What is it?
- lt's not very important.
It's just all I have.
- What's it say?
- "Out for brewskis.
Back in a giff."
What's a "giff"?
One of those little motor scooters, isn't it?
I'm sure he meant to write "jiff" with a J. "Back in a jiff."
But he wrote "giff."
- Could Frank be dyslexic?
- No.
Dyslexics are intelligent.
- What's that?
- Frank's bean ball.
- He gave you his bean ball?
- Not exactly.
This is an extra.
He thought he'd leave it here just in case he lost his other one.
Gosh, Violet, you've really gotta stop thinking about Frank.
Why?
I don't wanna stop thinking about him.
Recently I had a thought that cheered me up a lot.
Life is like a long, flowing river and as a long, flowing river, some debris you never expect to see again is almost certain to reappear floating to the surface.
Frank and I may very well be together again one day.
Maybe it'll take years, but somewhere down the line he's very likely to pop up again, and I'll be there to catch him.
I don't think we've spoken about this.
What?
Have you been to the south of France?
To the walled city of Carcassonne?
- l've never been anywhere.
- But you've seen pictures of it.
No, I don't think so.
Oh, it's fascinating.
- l'd like to visit.
- You never studied the Cathars?
They were a religious movement very idealistic located mostly in the southwest of France that the Catholic Church repressed.
Oh, my God.
The Catholic Church is, like, always bad.
Ideas can't be killed as easily as people.
Especially such enlightened ones as the Cathars held.
In recent years, more and more people have returned to their beliefs.
So you're a Cathar?
Yes. I aspire to be.
I'm trying to follow the path the Cathars marked out.
That's so impressive.
I can tell you we didn't have any Cathars back home.
I think you'd be surprised.
In the Cathar view the highest form of lovemaking avoids procreation entirely.
Sure.
Condoms, right?
Well, according to Cathar ideas sex with condoms is just a parody of the procreative act.
What do you mean?
The standard, cliché form of sexual intercourse is for the man to approach a woman from the front.
Cathar lovemaking, I think you'll find very fulfilling.
I'll be very careful, we'll go slowly.
It'll be a new experience but one which I think you'll find brings an inexpressible closeness.
Might your drinks-buying friend be around?
It would be great to get complimentary cocktails.
- Charlie?
No.
- Do you still see him at all?
- He calls from time to time.
- He does?
- Why don't you introduce us?
- Why should I introduce you?
Because you know him, and we don't.
So?
"So?"
"So" is probably the unkindest word in the English language.
I can't bear it. I think it should be outlawed. "So."
You're crazy.
Come on, Lily, you have Xavier.
- You can't keep two guys for yourself.
- Guys do that all the time.
We're not guys, fortunately.
It's unconscionable for you not to bring him and introduce us.
Charlie is a friend.
He's a nice guy.
What do you mean?
I hate to think what'd happen if you got your claws into him.
That's outrageous.
We're perfectly nice.
We've met lots of pathetic guys and nothing bad's happened.
- Charlie's not pathetic.
- Well, all the better, then.
The Roman Holidays will be coming soon.
- What's that?
- A festival Roman Letter Clubs put on.
A kind of moron jamboree.
The Roman elements are the worship of Bacchus, Beerus and Blotto.
- lt could've all been so uplifting.
- Charlie.
Hey, Charlie.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
- Have you the day off?
- Yeah.
This is my friend Charlie, whom I think I've mentioned.
And, Charlie, these are my roommates.
This is....
This is Rose.
And this is Heather.
And Violet.
Charlie works for Strategic Development Associates.
He's an associate there.
You work in strategic development?
- You've heard of it?
- Of course, yes.
My cousin Jay in Philadelphia works in strategic development.
Something business-related?
Mostly business, but any kind of organization.
- Only businesses pay the big bucks.
- Nonprofits and government pay well.
That's how they keep from having profits by paying lots of money to companies like yours.
Excuse me, but aren't you in Professor Ryan's course at the Ed School?
No.
You're not in Professor Ryan's Flit Lit course?
No.
- Flit Lit?
- The dandy tradition in literature.
- l'm sure I've seen you there.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm not in any courses at the Ed School.
Good to meet you.
- lt was great to see you.
- Bye.
God, Violet, what was that about?
That guy is definitely in Professor Ryan's class.
Not possible.
He has a fulltime job for Strategic Development Associates.
He never got his coffee.
- Why lie about something like that?
- He's lying.
I find that very attractive.
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna stop cutting Professor Ryan's class.
It can be argued that Firbank was too little disciplined too unserious in his unseriousness to create works of enduring value.
But as a liberating influence on later writers such as Waugh his importance should not be discounted.
It's not Firbank's work itself but the idea of his work that so helped later writers as Thomas Love Peacock did in the previous century.
I'm not gonna come anymore.
- What a waste of time.
- Charlie.
Charlie.
- Charlie?
- Charlie, you are taking the course.
Charlie?
Who's Charlie?
- Fred, what's going on?
- Fred?
Fred. sounds like you got some explaining to do.
- Well, you were lying.
- l wasn't lying, I was making it up.
Why were you making it up?
If you were an eighth-year Ed School student, would you advertise that?
Eighth year. impressive.
But your whole life was a lie.
Dressing up in suits.
Buying people drinks.
The suits were real.
The drinks, real.
Not just drinks for people.
They were for cute girls.
There's a perfectly rational, easily explainable agenda.
So it was a playboy or operator move.
- Of course.
Transparently so.
- l admire that.
Drinks are expensive.
But strategic development, that was made up too?
- You said your cousin Jay was in it.
- What cousin Jay?
- ln Philadelphia.
- l don't have a cousin in Philadelphia.
You said your cousin Jay was working in strategic development.
I was just saying that to be friendly.
To make a kind of link.
- So your name's Fred something?
- Yes.
Fred something.
- Packenstacker?
- Oh, my God.
How crazy.
He's completely insane.
I almost dated him.
- You can say that about a lot of guys.
- l don't think he's crazy.
Making up an entirely fictitious identity, that's not crazy?
- lt's insane. it's psycho.
- Violet's identity is made up.
- l don't think she's crazy.
- No, I am.
No, this is different.
It's crazy and pathetic.
All that about strategic development he just made up.
Don't tell me that's not weird.
I've heard of strategic development.
I think it's something pretty important.
Violet, you're not gonna start going out with him.
You're not, are you?
Well, we had planned to go to the library.
- Not to the stacks, I hope.
- Yes.
Oh, my gosh, do you realize how dangerous that is?
- Dangerous?
- Yes, the stacks.
They're dark and deserted.
Anything could happen.
It's true.
With the study habits at Seven Oaks your body won't be found until spring.
Promise you won't go with him to the stacks.
Please.
Okay. I'll suggest the Randall Room.
- Don't suggest. insist.
- And please not at night.
Okay.
What are you reading?
Have you chosen a topic for your final paper?
The decline of decadence.
You think that decadence has declined?
Definitely.
Bigtime.
Major, major decline.
How?
How or in what ways?
Either.
Well, take the flit movement in literature, or homosexuality.
It's gone completely downhill, right down the tubes.
What do you mean?
Before, homosexuality was something refined, hidden aspiring to the highest levels of creativity and often achieving it.
Now it seems to be musclebound morons running around in T-shirts.
It's pretty disillusioning.
Are you gay?
Not especially, but in another era, it might have had some appeal.
- Now I just don't see the point.
- You might be romanticizing the past.
We'll never know.
The past is gone, so we might as well romanticize it.
You could be right.
I wanted to ask, how's Lily?
Lily.
She's okay.
Here, check it out.
A.L.A. Nope.
Hello.
Good afternoon.
Check it out.
The A.L.A. Heard of it?
We have a meeting on Tuesday.
- You should come by.
- What is the A.L.A.?
Just join us.
Come Tuesday.
I think you'll really like it.
So....
A fellow was passing these out, and invited us to a meeting on Tuesday.
The A.L.A.?
Oh, my God.
I thought it was something related.
No?
The A.L.A. has got nothing to do with us.
Can't you see that?
The way we express love has meaning.
It's in the context of something beautiful.
We're following our creator's teaching.
Aspiring to an ideal.
A beautiful one that brings an inexpressible closeness.
Not just to each other, but....
For the A.L.A., and those like them the love act is just hedonistic pleasure-seeking of a perverted nature.
I can't believe you'd think we had anything in common with them.
We don't.
Nothing, not an iota.
My God, can't you see that?
Lily.
Lily, come back.
Please.
Don't be that way.
- Oh, my gosh, Lily.
Are you okay?
- lt's all right.
You don't wanna talk about it?
I don't understand.
- You don't understand what?
- What is non-procreative lovemaking?
- lt could be a lot of things.
- Yeah, but in this case?
- We don't have to talk about this.
- l don't mind.
Could somebody explain what this is about?
Well, if--
Cathars don't believe in procreative sex.
They don't have intercourse the usual way.
The usual way?
- You don't have to talk about this.
- No, it's okay.
It's the normal way, from the front where you can have procreation not from the other side, where you can't.
The other side?
That's their religion?
No, but it's the direction their beliefs head in.
When they express love, that's what they do.
How horrible.
You poor girl.
What?
That's terrible what he obliged Lily to do.
Violet.
Can we talk?
You must be pretty mad at me.
No.
You're not?
Not really.
But it was so terrible how everything happened.
Your walking in on us.
Maybe it's easier that way.
That bitch!
I can't believe it. what a bitch.
- Priss?
- Of course Priss.
"l'm so stressed.
Sad.
Depressed.
I'm so tired. I'm fatigued."
She was so depressed she had to get everything her own way.
"l'm so stressed.
Frantic."
Man.
What a bitch.
Priss dumped you?
No. lt was mutual.
Oh, listen, I have a question.
You remember that bean ball that I left in your room?
Yeah.
Do you still have it?
Yeah.
Do you think I could get it back?
I lost the other one, and with everything that's happened I'd really like to have it.
Nothing like some bean ball after a breakup.
Yeah.
God, you're smart.
You always get it.
Whatever I say you understand.
Man.
Hey, Heather.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey.
Violet.
Violet, what's wrong?
I'm sorry.
Lily's lovely.
Now she's free.
Go. I understand.
Latin!
Et cetera!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
This is what comes from not teaching Latin in the schools.
Yeah, it's moronic and boorish, but it's also kind of fun, don't you think?
No.
What's that stench?
I suppose this is what happens when decadence rots society from within.
And from without.
Such a society is, I fear destined to fail and be overrun.
Maybe that's good.
Finally. it's about time those cesspools were drained.
What color would you say that chair is?
That's a chair?
I have no idea.
- Guys have preferences.
- You're going to accept that?
- You're not going to do anything?
- There's nothing to be done.
- Fred must know his own mind.
- Oh, really?
- l seriously doubt that.
- Come on.
Lily's got that slender, delicately swelling beauty...
- ...that no man can resist.
- Okay, you're probably right.
Poor Lily.
Just think of all Xavier put her through.
He just used her body.
And not even the right side.
Have you noticed that good people tend to have large posteriors?
Not everyone, by any means.
I know it's not logical.
But it does seem to be true.
The genetic link between morality and large posteriors?
Yes, I think that's well known.
You and Violet have that build.
It's nice.
You're still very attractive, but also sensible and moralistic.
I don't. I have narrow hips, but also no very strong principles.
Yes?
Oh, hi.
- Hi, Frank.
- Hey, Heather.
So I guess you guys all heard.
University's closing all the Roman Letter Houses.
Sorry.
This year's Roman Holidays did seem like the end of civilization but when civilization ends people are going to need a place to stay.
Man.
It's bad.
It's that bastard from The Complainer.
Someone from the administration's been reading it.
Hard to believe.
Bastard.
Listen we were wondering if you thought it would be okay if we stayed at the suicide center.
Okay, sure.
That sounds like a good stopgap measure.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So there's one more thing.
Remember that bean ball we talked about?
Yes.
You think I could pick that up?
Just after everything that's happened, it-- l could really use it right now.
Yes.
- What's that?
- What?
The note.
One gets so few things written by hand anymore, I guess I kept it.
"Out for brewskis, back in a giff."
What's a giff?
It's the scooter.
Like a Vespa, right?
- That's what I thought.
- l was thinking about getting one.
You must've meant "jiff." "Back in a jiff."
And then misspelled it, or spelled it in a nonstandard way.
Yeah.
Not a good speller.
Thanks.
You're great.
Priss was such a bitch.
Damn.
Hey, Heather.
Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Heather is really cute.
She going out with anyone?
There might be something between her and Thor.
Thor?
Damn.
Heather and Thor?
Damn.
I'm worried about Thor.
It's hard for us to imagine how upsetting it is not knowing the colors.
It's impossible for me to imagine.
When Thor sees a rainbow, it's so much gibberish to him.
There was one this afternoon.
Oh, my gosh, he took it hard.
Recently, there was a parade in the city where the marchers carried rainbow-colored flags and banners.
Thor was so upset.
He had no idea what it meant.
What kind of retard is he?
See, that's the conclusion people jump to.
- Well, it is somewhat understandable.
- Not if you knew the full story.
What's the full story?
You know how parents love bragging about how precocious their children are?
Thor's parents had become precocity addicts constantly needing an ever-greater precocity fix.
He should've entered kindergarten.
They pushed him into first grade.
"Thor skipped a grade," they could tell.
What Thor's parents failed to consider is the work done in nursery school.
Key being the study of colors.
I suppose they just assumed that colors are knowledge people pick up.
Like, for example, not stepping on sidewalk cracks.
What's that?
I think Rose is sleeping.
Am I boring?
No, not at all.
When you have problems, it's great to hear someone else's idiotic ones.
Please go on.
- What?
- What you said about depressed people being mean, you weren't joking.
I'm sorry, you're right.
Please go on.
No.
I'm sorry.
You know how I am.
Please continue.
Thor decided he absolutely had to learn all the colors.
Both primary and mixed.
He's been hitting the books hard, and thought he'd mastered them.
Then, in town, he said, "That traffic light's blue."
I had to say, "No, it's green."
He was really upset.
Oh, hi, Lily.
Hi.
We were worried about you.
I can't bear this tension with Lily.
It's terrible to have the group divided this way.
Better not next to Robertson.
What?
Didn't you hear?
Ed students have been going up to the roof and throwing themselves off.
- But it's only two stories.
- Yes, I know.
It's terrible.
Not high enough to kill, but high enough to maim.
And particularly dangerous for anyone below.
I've got to forget about Fred.
But you really liked him.
This whole thing of a person meeting someone else first, it's so arbitrary.
- lt's terrible and cruel.
- l have to say, I was wrong about Fred.
I thought he was a playboy or operator type.
In fact, he's just another guy rendered helpless...
- ...by the attentions of a pretty girl.
- Cary!
No, don't!
I love you!
- Why did you do that?
- Oh, my God!
Cary, I love you!
Isn't the Ed School essentially a teacher's college?
Yeah.
If they can't even destroy themselves how are they going to teach America's youth?
- What do you think you're doing?
- Sorry.
Did I disturb you?
Why are you wearing tap shoes?
You out of your mind?
- l think that's pretty clear.
- l'm so sick of that.
Oh, really?
I think it's cute.
Since you won't be treating us to one of your incompetent tap routines...
- ...why don't you take those things off?
- No.
We'll do the routine.
Rose.
- Madge wants to see the routine.
- l don't want to see your routine.
- l asked you to take those off.
- We need a break.
Just briefly, please.
It's helpful to have an audience.
Rose, the music.
I'm gonna report you.
Suzanne.
For me, it'd be Madame Curie, Simone de Beauvoir...
- ...and Margaret Sanger.
- Good.
Violet.
I would say Richard Strauss, Roderick Charleston and Chubbard Checker.
- Richard Strauss?
The composer?
- Yes, that was one of his posts.
I'm not familiar with the others.
Could you tell us who they are?
Yes.
Each one of these men started an international dance craze.
Richard Strauss, the waltz.
Roderick Charleston, the Charleston.
Chubbard Checker, known as Chubby the dance we know as the twist.
Why do you consider a dance craze important?
Dance crazes enhance and elevate the human experience bringing together millions of people in a joyous celebration of our God-given faculties and passing these modes of physical expression down through the generations.
Though not so much anymore.
I thought-- Well, I assumed that the Charleston was named after the city of Charleston.
No.
Though that misconception is quite widely held.
It was Roderick Charleston.
Usually, behind some great creative phenomenon there's a person, not a town.
This is so exciting.
It's really great, isn't it?
- Hey, could you guys help?
- Sure.
What's up?
We need help packing soap which we'll distribute to Doar Dorm residents.
Cool.
What would you say are effective means to fight depression?
Maybe some of your DU brothers have an idea?
- Beer?
- No.
Beer's a downer.
Cocktails.
Hard liquor and spirits is what really gives you a lift.
It's interesting what you say.
My cousin Jay is a medical officer in Philadelphia.
He says that alcoholism by which I mean chronic, excessive consumption of alcohol is the primary self-administered treatment for depression.
- Cool.
- No.
It leaves you much worse off than before.
Oh, no, not me.
I just boot and then I feel fine.
- By "boot" do you mean vomit?
- Yes.
No.
None of the effective anti-suicide treatments involve vomiting.
- Hygiene?
- Exactly.
It's very important.
That's why we have such hope in the wonder bar.
Do you know its scent?
Transformative, we think.
This is so exciting.
When should we go over there?
- l don't think there's any rush.
- l'd like to go soon.
Doar Dorm has the highest fatality rate, as well as the worst hygiene.
Highest suicide rate.
Fatality rate. lt's uncertain what percentage were intentional and how many were just due to unawareness of gravity's laws.
I can just see those guys getting the gold packages, opening them and finding the good-smelling soap inside.
The cute packaging should prove irresistible.
And once clean, they'll start to see the world with new eyes.
The change could be dramatic.
Doar Dorm could soon become Dior Dorm.
I doubt that, to be perfectly, absolutely honest.
I love the idea.
Dior Dorm.
I adore optimism, even when it's completely absurd.
- Perhaps especially then.
- Great.
Ready?
Let's go.
Let's hurry.
Let's not get our hopes up too high, Heather.
No, you said yourself, the wonder bar is transformative.
- Hey, Violet.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Where you going?
- Doar Dorm.
- Fred, hi.
- Hey.
Good one.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
I guess it wasn't realistic to expect Doar Dorm to turn into Dior Dorm overnight.
They wouldn't even open them.
They said without the soap, the discs wouldn't fly properly.
Are you coming Friday?
Violet's launching her dance craze.
Oh, really?
That's great.
- What's the dance?
- The Sambola.
The devil's dance.
- Oh, cool.
We'll go, right?
- Yes, I'd like to.
But I have several papers to finish.
But I'd like to.
Great.
Thanks, Gus.
I don't see how we're going to start a dance craze if no guys show up.
Most guys aren't very good with the dance-craze thing.
Very good news. I was just in my procrastination seminar and the two guys from Doar Dorm had showered.
It was clear they'd used soap.
Oh, my gosh, what a difference.
Seems they'd been throwing packages so energetically, a soap bar fell out.
The unfamiliar ivory-like object intrigued them and one thing led to another, and, well.... lt was just as you said.
Isn't that great?
- Oh, look, here's Jimbo.
- Jimbo doesn't count.
Where is everybody?
Aren't we gonna be late for Violet's dance craze?
You wanna go to that?
Yeah.
- You're kidding.
- No, I love dance crazes.
Gosh, you're strange.
But aren't we already late?
No, it's later on.
Like 10, I think.
I have to confess, I've started losing patience with Violet.
Depression calls for serious treatment.
Medication.
Psychopharmaceuticals.
Talk therapy.
Are those approaches effective?
Despite the medication and therapy Ed School students are still throwing themselves off Robertson Hall.
Violet's ideas might seem a little offbeat--
A little?
Oh, my God. I don't know how much you know about Violet but there's some pretty weird stuff.
You know, Violet.
Violet Wister.
It's not even her real name.
- lt isn't?
- No, it's Emily Tweeter.
When she was 11, she went completely crazy and has had several relapses since.
So it's a little worrisome to have her counsel nearly suicidal individuals.
I can't believe it.
- What?
- Emily Tweeter.
In first grade, I had an enormous crush on a girl with that name.
- And you remember that?
- Yeah.
Pretty huge Dr. Zhivago stuff.
Any idea or even mention of her filled me with emotion.
I had a strange perspective on the world.
I don't think my brain was functioning properly.
Everything was a bit of a dream.
You think this was Violet?
You have any idea if Violet attended willamette Montessori?
In Portland?
- We didn't order these.
- Compliments of the guy at the bar.
It was so brutal how it ended between us.
I know I was too angry and a bit crazy but I thought that what we had was stronger than that.
That you would not just walk away after one disagreement.
It wasn't just that.
You mean my Cathar beliefs.
Well I am no longer a Cathar.
How is that possible?
It's been very difficult.
You've dropped your adherence to the Cathar faith?
- Yes, I have.
- Good.
Normally I'd be reluctant to comment on anyone's religion, but....
What?
I'm sorry. I guess-- l guess I'm a bit of a bigot. I just-- l could never take seriously any religion that worships on Tuesdays.
Major religions require worship on the weekend.
Friday, Saturday or Sunday.
I find it just really laudatory that people sacrifice their weekend time to worship God.
Having the Sabbath on Tuesday always seemed very bizarre to me.
It's not right.
You know what?
We'd better get to the Lone Star.
Why are you so concerned about that?
Well, it's not as if international dance crazes start every day.
We'd better hurry.
What's wrong?
Another fiasco.
Sometimes our struggle reminds me of the myth of Sisyphus.
- Who?
- The myth about the guy who pushes an enormous rock only to have it keep rolling back.
Oh, yeah.
What a knucklehead.
The important thing to remember is that he was mythical.
He never really existed.
Violet?
Did you spend any part of your education at Willamette Montessori?
In Oregon?
Why?
Sound like "tweaker."
Would you say today is very gray?
I'd say so.
Maybe blue-gray.
Yeah, no, that rings a bell now.
Bye.
I'm sorry.
Her name wasn't Emily Tweeter, but Lucy Wurlitzer.
They're not similar. I'm beginning to realize that the human memory is not the foolproof instrument we sometimes imagine.
What's worse, everyone knew about my obsession, including my parents those from whom I most wanted it kept.
So from your earliest years, you were already a playboy or operator type?
Yes. I suppose that's why secrecy seemed so desirable.
Violet, can we talk?
- What's the plural of doofus?
- Doufi.
Not doofuses?
You can say either.
"Doufi" respects the Latin root and is preferred.
"Doofuses" is also correct, although a bit inelegant.
- You've thought a lot about this.
- Yes, I've had to.
Why?
What is it?
I like Fred, he's a nice guy.
And I can see why you like him.
When I first met you and Rose, I thought you were the cool crowd.
And in many ways you are. I find your perfume and fashion sense excellent.
Thank you.
But there's a reason, I think why you are so strongly attracted to doufi.
And it's not an accident how different groups divide up.
Isn't that a rainbow?
- That's a rainbow!
- Thor.
No, Thor!
Thor, no!
Stop!
Please, stop!
He's headed for Robertson Hall!
Red.
Orange.
Yellow.
Green.
Blue. Indigo.
Hallelujah!
Lord God, thank you.
Education.
Education.
We can learn the subjects we set out to master no matter how hard or impossible they may seem.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I wasn't sure I was gonna make it.
Magenta.
Pink.
Mauve.
I miss my nice American friend.
No, you're mistaken.
- You go to London for four weeks?
- Six.
It's dangerous, parents letting children travel.
They send them off and they don't know what they'll be getting back.
I don't know what you're referring to.
You're not from London.
I'm from London.
I was there, now I'm here.
I'm from London.
I just miss my nice American friend.
Nice?
Nice?
Fine. I'm fine.
Those are not adjectives I like to use.
God gave us abilities.
He requires that we use them.
Good, better, best, excelsior, higher.
Only excellence can glorify the Lord.
Vulgarity is, in essence, blasphemous.
I'm sorry for what I was saying before.
Of course you're not linked to the doufi or even that such distinctions are valid.
No, don't apologize.
I probably do have a doufi orientation.
But behind coolness, isn't there a certain repressing squashing down, or lack of cultivation of one's humanity?
Oh, so you think that cool people have less humanity?
No, I don't think cool people are entirely inhuman.
Just enough to be cool.
In our society, there's all this propaganda in favor of uniqueness, eccentricity, et cetera.
But does the world really want or need more of such traits?
Aren't such people usually terrible pains in the neck?
What the world needs to work properly is a large mass of normal people.
I would like to be one of those.
Sorry.
But you'll still do the part?
Yeah, of course.
So do you know every number...
- ...in every Fred Astaire movie?
- There were two in our school musical.
- l know those.
- Did performing those two numbers help you overcome feelings of discouragement and despair?
Absolutely.
Freak.
Hey, everybody, let's do the Sambola.
-Look.
-Where?
There.
Yes. I think so.
Hello.
Are you a new student?
-Yes.
-Good.
We thought so.
We'd like to help you.
Help me?
What do you mean?
As a freshman, it can be very tough.
You get to college and it's supposed to be great, but it's not.
University life can be pretty bad.
-There are a lot of suicides.
-Well, attempted ones.
I'm not actually a freshman.
I'm a transfer student.
-Oh, an entering sophomore?
-Yes.
You were unhappy and are looking to recover here.
-Well, I think you will.
-Yes.
Would you welcome that?
Would our help be something you'd appreciate?
Or would you rather sink or swim on your own?
-Either way is fine.
We'll be friends.
-Yes, whichever you'd prefer.
Yes.
Sure.
Great.
We should start immediately.
Clothes can be crucial for confidence and an overall sense of well-being.
-Clothes don't have to be expensive.
-You need friends of the same size.
-You don't like my clothes?
-l'm just saying.
Move it out.
What?
What's wrong?
-What's wrong?
-You didn't notice that?
-No.
What?
-Those guys.
That smell.
That awful, acrid odor.
Have you heard of nasal shock syndrome?
Any harsh, acrid or just disgusting odor sends Rose into nasal shock.
Just from some BO?
"Just some BO"?
Oh, my God, Lily.
You must have a very high threshold for pain.
That'll serve you well at Seven Oaks.
-What do you mean?
-Seven Oaks is notorious for its BO.
It was the last of the Select Seven to go coed.
An atmosphere of male barbarism predominates...
-...but we're going to change that.
-Yes.
Where are you going?
Gotta get to the Housing Department.
They lost my rooming assignment.
That's terrible.
You have no place to stay?
Was it just mislaid?
No, there were more acceptances than they anticipated and not enough rooms to go around, so....
Why don't you stay with us?
Really?
Don't think of this in the old-fashioned sense of going to a party to find someone or not find someone.
That's not the dynamic that we're talking about.
-What dynamic are you talking about?
-Glad you asked.
Our going to a party of this kind is more a form of youth outreach.
-Of what?
-Youth outreach.
It's not just some moronic frat-house social function.
Though it will be that too.
We've gotta keep in mind that these guys are young people.
They're essentially immature and crying out for help and guidance.
-Though they don't know it.
-No, they don't, but we do.
-Aren't they the same age as we are?
-Only numerically.
I'm a lot fatter than you are, but I think we could pin it.
Oh, my gosh, that's beautiful.
Stunning.
Take Frank, my friend.
He's not some cool, handsome, studly macho type.
No, not at all.
I can't stand guys like that.
He's more of a sad sack really, wouldn't you say?
-Definitely.
-What is a sad sack?
A loser.
-You like losers?
-Very much so.
Do you know what's the major problem in social life?
What?
The tendency, widespread, to always seek someone cooler than yourself.
It's always a stretch.
Often a big stretch.
Why not find someone who's inferior?
-Someone like Frank.
-Yes. lt's more rewarding.
And, in fact, quite reassuring.
You mean someone you can help, not just thinking of yourself.
Yes, that's it, precisely.
But without the goody-goody implications.
Our aspirations are pretty basic.
Take a guy who hasn't realized his full potential or doesn't even have much and then help him realize it or find more.
There's enough material here for a lifetime of social work.
What's really worrisome is that that was intentional.
Frank.
Frank, this is Lily.
She's just come to Seven Oaks as a transfer student. lsn't she great?
Lily failed or wasn't happy at her last school.
We're sure that she's going to adapt here.
-ln fact, she already has.
-Oh, good.
Oh, my God.
A golden oldie.
I love these.
-Oh, my gosh.
Wasn't that great?
-That was really fun.
I know that people can have useful careers in many areas.
Medicine, government, law, finance.
-Education.
-Yes, even education.
But I'd like to do something especially significant in my lifetime.
That could change the course of human history.
-Such as starting a new dance craze.
-Really?
Yes.
Something that could improve the lives of every person and every couple.
I'm so proud of what you accomplished last night.
You showed those guys a really good time.
Without anything really bad happening.
That's good.
The guys you know, are they all Greeks?
-What?
-Are all the guys you know Greeks?
Excuse me. I don't understand.
Are all the guys you know Greeks?
-l don't think we know any Greeks.
-Greeks, like frat boys.
Oh, yes.
Fraternities.
You mean members of the Greek-letter fraternities.
Yeah.
Like last night.
Actually, last night we were at the DU house.
DU.
Roman letters.
Not Greek.
Seven Oaks has never had a Greek-letter fraternity system.
It's always been a Roman-letter system here.
It's very different.
-What house is this?
-Oh, this isn't a fraternity.
At least not one anyone should want to join.
You probably think we're frivolous, empty-headed college coeds.
You're probably right.
I often feel empty-headed.
We're trying to make a difference in people's lives.
One way to do that is to stop them from killing themselves.
Have you ever heard of "Prevention is nine-tenths the cure"?
Well, in the case of suicide, it's actually 1 0-tenths the cure.
-Those are clichés, aren't they?
-Yes, they are.
It's interesting you say that. I love clichés and hackneyed expressions.
-Do you know why?
-No.
Because they're largely true.
The hundreds, perhaps thousands of such clichés and hackneyed expressions that our language has bequeathed us are a stunning treasure trove of human insight and knowledge.
-Really?
-Yes.
Oh, please sit down.
During these formative college years we should learn as many clichéd and hackneyed thoughts as possible.
Furthermore, I think we will.
Speaking of suicide prevention, do you have a boyfriend, Lily?
-Are you dating anyone?
-l don't see the connection.
-You don't?
-Boyfriends are a primary suicide risk.
You don't have any particular friend?
No one at all?
No.
Well, there's this grad student I met over summer.
Xavier.
We became pretty good pals.
He has a girlfriend whom I've met.
She's very nice.
"Zavier." With a Z?
-No, I think it's with an X.
-No, I'm certain it's Z.
Zavier, like Zorro.
It's the same sound.
Zorro marked his name with a Z.
It's an X.
But Zorro's with a Z.
Okay, let me see if I can figure this out.
Used at the beginning of a name, Z and X have the same pronunciation.
-But it's Zorro with a Z.
-Actually, there were two Zorros.
One spelled his name with a Z and made a Z mark for Zorro.
And there's Xorro who spelled his name with an X and with his sword he'd make an X mark.
What was really unfair was because he marked his name with X everybody assumed he was illiterate when he was spelling correctly.
-Hello.
-Can we help you?
Of course we can.
No case is too challenging.
-Would you like a doughnut?
-Okay.
Please, sit down.
-Here, have some coffee.
-Thank you.
-What's your name?
-Jim Bose.
-But my friends call me Jimbo.
-Why?
-What?
-Why do your friends call you Jimbo?
Well, it's a contraction of Jim and the first part of my last name, Bose.
Yeah, I got that.
But why bother?
-What do you mean?
-Jim is already a lovely name.
It's short, simple, evocative.
Shouldn't a nickname simplify the name that it replaces?
Jimbo doesn't really simplify anything.
I don't know.
Well, maybe you should ask your friends.
Where do you live or reside?
Doar Dorm.
-Oh, my God.
Yuck.
-What?
-The smell, it's notorious.
-What smell?
You're right, it's more like a stink.
Unclean clothing, I'd say, mostly.
-Vomit.
-Stale beer.
Pot.
Cheap deodorant.
There might be a vermin infestation.
Did you know a good-smelling environment is crucial to our sense of well-being?
Have you tried to find a better-smelling place?
Wait, wait.
It's not me, I'm not depressed.
-You're not?
-No.
Are you sure?
You kind of seem on edge.
-No, I'm fine.
-That's a terrible expression. "Fine."
"l'm fine."
Something smug about it. "l'm fine."
-Why do you say that you're fine?
-l'm not depressed. I'm not suicidal.
Why are you here, then?
Are you a con man?
-A confidence trickster?
-No, there's a girl.
Her boyfriend dumped her.
She was crying but now is silent.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you say so?
We have to go.
Call the cops!
A suicide might be in progress!
-The campus cops?
-Yes, of course the campus cops.
Take this.
We have a lot of students coming to the center pretending to be depressed to get doughnuts.
-Confidence tricksters.
-Yes, it's really bad.
Really cynical.
We pledged to the doughnut company we would only give doughnuts to students who were depressed or otherwise nutty.
We're a nonprofit, so the rules are pretty strict.
-This man could still be a trickster.
-Well, we'll soon find out.
Tell me about this girl.
Well, her name is Priss.
She's very pretty.
Oh, yes. lt's very hard for beautiful women to experience rejection.
Priss?
Priss.
Are you okay?
Priss!
Priss, say something!
Priss!
Open up!
Oh, thank God.
We're gonna have to force this door.
Priss?
Are you okay?
-What?
-Please don't.
Please, come with us.
Do you wanna talk about it?
What was his name?
Josh.
If you'd rather not talk, we don't have to.
No, it's okay, I just....
l keep thinking how he used to gaze at me with such love in his eyes.
You know what I mean?
No.
No, I've never actually seen that.
Yes.
Just days ago, he'd gaze at me.
His eyes, so blue.
He had blue eyes?
So does Frank.
Frank's the guy that I go out with.
Otherwise, he's not conventionally good-looking, which I actually prefer.
Would you describe Josh as handsome?
-That's a problem.
-Could I join you guys?
Yes, please.
Priss and I were just talking.
In my view, handsome men are to be avoided.
I don't even consider good looks to be flattering in a man.
-Do you know what I mean?
-No.
Cookie-cutter, good-looking guys, with their chiseled features running around, full of themselves getting everything they want, never suffering or experiencing--
We suffered?
We're not under discussion.
That's irrelevant.
That's besides the point.
-ls this making you feel any better?
-Yes. I think so.
Good. I hoped it would.
Okay, it's nearly 4 and The Daily Complainer's orientation meeting is about to start and I think we should go.
The editor, Rick DeWolfe, he's terrible.
A real jerk.
Why do you think he's such a jerk?
He's one of those that I was talking about.
Tall.
Probably considers himself very smart and handsome.
A journalist, so you can imagine the mindboggling arrogance and conceit.
-But, Violet, don't you think--?
-What?
Well, don't you think that the way you talk could be considered arrogant too?
I mean, a little?
Yes, of course.
But what's your point?
Wouldn't that be hypocritical, criticizing Rick for something you could be criticized for yourself?
No. I don't see why.
We're all flawed.
Must that render us mute to the flaws of others?
Must we tether ourselves from comment because our natures are human too?
We've got a rebel amongst us.
That's good, I think. lt's good to be challenged and criticized.
I know your intentions are good, it's just--
That's it precisely.
Our intentions are good.
We're seeking to help people rescue their lives from terrible sadness and failure which is a worthy goal, don't you think?
Yes.
But not exactly a humble one.
No.
I agree with you there.
You're right, absolutely.
I'd like to thank you for this chastisement.
-l'm sorry, I didn't mean to chastise.
-No, I think you did and I think it's good.
It's good to have a friend to put one in one's place when that's what one needs.
Now I see that I have that kind of friend in you.
I think that's great.
Hello, people.
Listen up.
People, quiet.
Quiet, people.
Shut up!
Okay, that's better. I'm Rick DeWolfe, editor of The Complainer.
Over the next weeks, I'm the person you're gonna hate most in the world.
You're gonna hate me because I'm gonna work you point out your stupidity and incompetence and do everything in my power to turn you into journalists.
-Albeit barely literate ones.
-Oh, brother.
Any questions?
No?
Yes.
How did The Daily Complainer get its name?
Isn't that pretty obvious?
It comes out every day and it's the university daily.
So The Daily Complainer.
-The Daily--
-No, I meant--
Oh, you mean, why The Complainer?
The name dates from Seven Oaks' earliest days as a divinity school.
The reference is to the Book of Job.
Job's complaint with the world.
Before justice can be achieved, a complaint must be made.
That is what we do and people don't like it a bit.
Right now, what that means is extirpating Seven Oaks' elitist Roman Letter Clubs that are like a cancer on the community.
They're not elitist in the least.
Yes, they are.
Have you met any of their members?
The guys from the DU, for example?
They're barely competent for the tasks of everyday life.
They have to drink a quart of beer just to talk to a woman?
-Two quarts.
-Yet you salivate at the idea of taking the roof off their heads and throwing them on the street where who knows what would happen.
You call yourself a Christian.
-No, I don't.
-What unkindness and cruelty.
This is the darkness in the heart of man, which Joseph Conrad wrote about most eloquently.
-He was actually Polish.
-Oh, my God.
Unkind, self-righteous and pedantic.
In short, a model journalist.
You should know something about these girls.
They run the suicide center where their preferred therapy for depressed and suicidal people is tap dancing.
-l kid you not.
-Tap is a highly effective therapy as well as a dazzlingly expressive dance form that has been sadly neglected for too many years.
It's moronic and barbaric.
You expect tap dancing to solve people's problems?
No, we don't.
We're using the whole range of musical dance numbers which have proven themselves to be effective therapies for the suicidal and the hopelessly depressed.
That really got me down.
-l thought you handled it well.
-You did?
Thanks.
No, it's all this aggression and hostility that gets me down.
Not just his but also my own.
It leaves you feeling unclean.
Have you thought of taking a shower?
Maybe you'd feel better.
You're probably right.
No, there's something else.
What Lily was saying about me being conceited and arrogant.
-l'm sorry.
-No, I think you're right.
I'm really ashamed.
-You're joking.
-No, it's terrible how I've acted.
We're all Christians.
Or I should say Judeo-Christians.
Humility should be our watchword.
The essence of being a good person.
Humility comes from within.
If it's not there in the first place, where do you go to get it?
I stopped looking a long time ago.
Very good, Freak.
-You really think so?
-Yes.
Certainly.
-Five, six, seven, eight.
-Violet.
is it such a good idea to call him Freak?
What?
He's already depressed and you're calling him Freak.
That's his name.
Freak.
Freak Astaire.
That's how he wants to be called.
What are you talking about?
Lily was just saying she likes your dancing.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Are you okay?
What do you mean?
I thought you looked sad and was wondering...
-...if there was anything we could do.
-What could you do?
Oh, I know.
You think I'm gonna kill myself and make you look bad.
No, I'm worried that you'll kill yourself and make yourself look bad.
Do you have any idea how demoralizing it is to be constantly questioned about whether you're suicidal or not?
No.
After a while, you wonder, why is everyone asking me this?
They want me to be suicidal?
Or is it just the consequence of your utter absurdity?
Excuse me.
What scent are you wearing?
-What are you talking about?
-The perfume you're wearing.
I'm not wearing any perfume!
You see, that could be the problem.
-l've become friends with a group.
-Really?
-Although they're perfume-obsessed.
-Oh, them?
Those girls?
The ones who volunteer at the center?
-Yeah.
-But they're terrible.
The blond one?
She's notorious.
-What do you mean?
-Such a bitch.
Terrible, isn't she?
-Would balsamic be okay?
-What?
Balsamic vinegar.
For the dressing.
Yeah, sure.
-What's that?
-What?
-Those.
-Artichokes?
is that what they look like?
Come on, Lily.
You've seen an artichoke before.
-You haven't?
-They look so weird.
I'm not convinced that having a suicide-prevention center prevents any suicides.
Well, the coffee's good.
If someone were determined to destroy themselves...
-...
I don't think they'd stop for coffee.
-lt depends on what it tastes like.
-Where are we going?
-l thought I'd take Priss over to DU.
Why?
It might be helpful for her to meet some of the guys.
How would that be helpful?
They're morons.
-Oh, come on, Lily.
-No, they're morons.
No.
Not medically. I like them.
They're in that sympathetic range of being not good-looking and yet not smart.
There's something likable about that.
Spending time with them, you get the sense that you're making a difference.
For somebody suicidal, like Priss, that could be a real boost.
-l'm not suicidal.
-Oh, that's good.
It's better not to have an identity as a suicidal person, don't you think?
-Well, bye.
-Well....
-Where are you going?
-Over to Xavier's.
-ls that a good idea?
-Why wouldn't it be?
-ls his girlfriend gonna be there?
-Of course.
-Gosh, you're nosy.
-No, no, it's just a general foreboding.
"Foreboding"?
You know, you're absolutely right.
I was being nosy.
Terribly so.
-l've gotta watch that.
-Yes, we must improve ourselves.
-Bye.
-Bye.
Bye.
Lily.
-You were coming over?
-Hey.
Yeah. ls Alice home?
Alice is working.
-Oh, she is?
-But it's not a problem.
It's good you came.
Let's go to the Oak Bar.
I'll buy you a beer.
-l thought Alice would be back.
-l'll call her.
She'll join us there.
Come on.
Okay.
She's actually quite a good person.
Her entire identity revolves around helping people.
You really think that's true?
What's she have against The Complainer?
That's bizarre.
Well, she thinks the editor, Rick DeWolfe, is completely egotistical.
And your friend isn't?
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Hi, Lily.
-Hi.
-Great.
You got the message.
-Yeah.
-Who's egotistical?
-Lily's roommate.
She sounds unbearable.
She's on a rampage against The Complainer.
Really?
Why?
She thinks the editor, Rick DeWolfe, is conceited.
-And, in fact, quite mean.
-Mean?
Yes.
He wants to close the Seven Oaks Roman Letter Clubs.
That's good, isn't it?
Everyone was against them.
-No.
-Come on.
There's no justification for those places.
They're exclusive and elitist.
The point that Violet makes is that they can't be elitist.
-They're morons.
-Yeah, elitist morons.
You'll grant they're morons.
That's a handicap.
Such people should be helped, not hounded and persecuted.
-Persecuted?
-Yes, losing the roof over your head?
That's the worst thing that can happen.
Violet thinks there could be some risk of suicide.
Because some boy might kill himself, Seven Oaks can't do what's right?
It's a factor to be considered.
-Yeah.
-No, it isn't.
You can't set policy that way.
-Excuse me, we didn't order these.
-Compliments of the guy at the bar.
That's a playboy or operator move.
Operators like that are to be avoided.
Why?
It seems generous, sending drinks to people you don't know.
-Drinks are expensive.
-Drinks to two gorgeous girls.
His intention was to seduce and he assumed he could.
-Both?
-That seems a bit harsh.
You don't know what he was thinking.
Was he alone?
Yes.
You see?
He was alone and probably lonely.
He could see that Alice and Lily were students.
Students are known for their intelligent conversation.
They can always talk about their courses.
That was probably what attracted him.
Nonsense.
Perhaps his view was even loftier.
To court Lily with a view to matrimony.
We're in the north, but a southern gentleman can wander into these parts.
Rubbish.
Seeing Lily across a crowded bar filled with the usual undergraduate slobs.
Why wouldn't a thoughtful young man seek her out?
She's lovely.
Isn't it incumbent on men and women to find ways to meet each other?
Buying drinks for a person you don't know seems to be a generous one.
Yes.
Most guys won't even pay for the women they do know.
What you've described is a playboy or operator move.
I'll grant you that it's a tactic or perhaps even a ruse but without some of that, would our species even survive?
The Lord said, "Be fruitful and multiply."
Oh, my gosh.
No, this is how the world works, seeing someone across a room.
This could be the romantic story you tell your grandchildren.
And if you do marry and have children then he'll really learn how to squander cash.
Isn't it good to know that he's basically generous from the start?
Where's Priss?
Your eyes are so striking.
So blue.
-Really?
They're blue?
-Yes.
The most piercing blue.
You must know your eyes are blue.
-No.
-What do you mean?
What?
You must know what color your eyes are.
Your eyes are very blue.
You know that.
I'm not gonna go around checking what color my eyes are.
When you look in the mirror, you see that your eyes are blue.
-Oh, come on.
-What?
I don't think my eyes have a color.
If my eyes are so blue looking out, wouldn't everything be kind of blue?
Like, have a bluish tinge to it?
Doesn't.
Just looks normal.
That's...?
That's blue?
-That color?
-Yes, of course.
Then what color is that?
Green.
You're saying that chair's green but Frank's eyes are blue?
Yes.
Then what color are the walls?
Also green.
You didn't know that?
No.
How's that possible?
You think knowing the colors is so important?
You're in college and you don't know the colors?
Doesn't that embarrass you?
Well, no.
Why should it?
That's why the 'rents are paying big bucks to send me here.
You know, to learn stuff.
Well, gotta go hit the books.
I don't think anyone should feel embarrassed about not knowing stuff.
What's embarrassing is pretending to know.
Or putting people down because you think they don't know as much.
Look, I'm happy to admit I'm completely ignorant.
That's why I'm here and plan to really hit the books.
So the next time you see me, I will know more than I do now.
I'll be older but also wiser.
Or at least know more stuff.
For me, that's education.
Cheers.
Thor's great.
He's very clear about his objectives.
He really wants to learn things.
Frank?
What a jerk.
-He's a monster.
-Oh, my gosh, Violet.
You did everything for them.
They're nothing without you.
-What a rat.
-He's a moron.
-Don't waste a tear on that creep.
-Don't waste a single breath.
-Jerk.
-Stop.
-Please.
-What?
I love Frank.
I love him.
Come on, Violet, Frank's a moron.
You are well rid of him.
-Don't say that.
-Frank's not a moron?
You know, Lily, you're a bit harsh.
This obsession with intelligence.
Do you think it has some magical quality transforming everything?
The intelligence line is not an immutable barrier.
Love can cross it.
You can love someone whose mental capacity is not large.
I know. I have.
-Well, there's a mutable barrier, then.
-Frank's stupid, we knew.
That he's a rat playboy operator, I hadn't realized.
I don't want to turn bitter.
-l worry for Frank. I care about him.
-Well, I'd stop.
No.
I love Frank.
I always will.
If that's the case, why not fight for him?
-Against Priss?
I'd never win.
-Sure you would.
Priss is a rat.
A bitch.
A rat bitch.
Don't blame Priss.
She was crushed when her blue-eyed Josh left her.
I should've known.
Of course she'd fall for Frank.
Josh and Frank are both blue-eyed heartbreakers.
Poor Violet.
She's the roommate who's so self-confident?
Yeah.
But now she's a wreck.
But there's no logic to the algebra of love.
"The algebra of love."
That sounds like the title to some lame book.
It's a title, but the book's not lame at all.
Love's algebra?
I thought it was more geometry.
Okay, the title's not good, but the book is.
What's it say?
Well, that while we're all perverse in our romantic preferences there's actually this logic or algebra to our perversity and it has something to do with how the species has evolved.
-The survival of the species?
-Yes.
And whether it will continue to do so.
No booze?
Just to find the nearest package store, you had to drive 40 miles.
-These aren't so strong.
-No, they're really strong.
I think I'd like another.
-That wouldn't be a good idea.
-Why not?
-Well....
-Are you trying to stifle me?
-Lily?
-Oh, hi.
Listen, we're gonna get something to eat.
Why don't you come with us?
-l'm with Charlie.
-l can see that.
-But you really should come.
-Why?
I just think it would be a good idea.
-But why?
-You really must come. I insist.
Lily?
Lily, are you angry?
Lily, this is it.
We're here.
What's the matter?
That was so rude.
He's a nice guy and you embarrassed him.
He's not nice.
He was trying to get you drunk.
-No, he wasn't.
-Plying you with martinis?
-l was plying myself with martinis.
-Come on, the guy's a total sleaze.
-A creep.
-You don't know anything about him.
The way he sent drinks over to our table?
Alice.
Alice, what's wrong?
I had no idea that Xavier could be so mean.
Sounds as if he was just trying to protect you.
This Charlie Walker sounds like an operator or playboy type.
No, he's not like that.
He's actually a really nice guy.
I thought he was a slick businessman.
No.
He dresses well, but he works in strategic development.
-What?
-Strategic development.
He works at SDA.
Strategic Development Associates.
-He's an associate there.
-What he is, is a strategic operator.
Violet, are you okay?
Hey, miss, rain's coming!
Better get back!
-Polly, have you seen Violet?
-No. ls something wrong?
We're not sure.
Violet!
-Violet!
-Violet!
Oh, my gosh, what happened?
I don't understand.
What were you doing?
How long were you gone for?
I'm sorry, I don't know.
I lost track of time.
But you feel better now?
Well, cleaner.
She'll say anything to get in the show.
-She'll want doughnuts.
-You don't have to be suicidal...
-...to get doughnuts, just depressed.
-Clinically depressed.
From a clinic.
-Would you say you're depressed?
-l don't like the term.
-l prefer to say I'm in a tailspin.
-Oh, my God.
A tailspin?
She can't even say she's depressed.
She's gotta say something special.
Priss was honest.
She was depressed and she had a right to be in the show.
Now every silly tailspinner's trying to get in.
-The show is for everyone.
-No, it isn't, Freak.
To be in the center's programs, you have to be clinically depressed.
That means that you've been to a clinic and they've said that you're depressed.
Have you been to a clinic?
Have you been to a clinic?
Then you're not clinically depressed.
Violet.
Violet.
What is it?
Where are you going?
All I wanted was to make Frank happy.
I had all these plans.
Things we could've done together.
I never even got to tell him.
Hey!
Where all your boyfriends at?
Come on!
They don't wear bikinis.
They're ladies, they wear thongs.
I can't imagine where she could've gone.
Wherever she went, she should be back by now.
How did she seem when you last saw her?
Really sad about Frank.
-Still?
-Yeah.
How can someone so smart continue mooning over a dope like that?
People aren't exactly as you assume.
The Violet you know bears little resemblance to the girl I met in seventh grade.
-You met Violet in seventh grade?
-Well, her name wasn't Violet then.
What's your name?
You can tell us your name.
We won't bite.
What's your name?
Tell us.
Are you retarded?
Tell us your name.
Emily Tweeter.
-Tweeter?
Like a bird?
-That's ridiculous.
Tweeter?
Like a bird?
-Not an easy name to have at that age.
-Not at any age.
What was she like?
Timid.
Bookish.
Classic scholarship student.
Her parents were writers.
They didn't have a dime.
Finances were the least of her worries.
-What do you mean?
-Well, she was crazy.
I got stuck rooming with her on a trip when no one else would.
-lt was awful.
-Did she smell bad?
No.
Obsessive cleanliness was part of her insanity.
-You were nice to her.
-No.
The idea of being nice to weird kids hadn't arrived.
-Why was she so unpopular?
-Well, she was very strange.
Constantly setting herself odd, repetitive tasks.
Tasks?
For example, on that trip she had with her a little square suitcase.
The idea came into her head she had to move it in a precise pattern over and over again and if she didn't execute this movement flawlessly 1 0 times she'd start over.
Another was to slide her hand across her forehead trying not to touch her hair or eyebrows on either side also repeating it 1 0 times.
Any niggling thought she'd touched the hair, she'd start over.
-My God, that is insane.
-Why would she do that?
She had the conviction that if she didn't complete these tasks her parents would die.
-Was she Catholic?
-No.
But what made the whole thing really sad was that her parents did die.
Oh, my God.
Violet!
Violet?
Violet!
Violet, where are you?
Something's wrong, isn't it, dear?
You mind my asking?
Well, I do mind a little.
-Excuse me, Your Highness.
-l'm sorry.
-lt's just kind of awkward to talk about.
-No matter.
I hope you haven't come to get run over on the highway.
-What do you mean?
-Suicides.
They come down from the university.
Jump out in the road.
Get hit by the blind curve.
Hope you're not one of them.
Do I look like one of them?
I don't know.
Maybe.
Messy people, suicides.
Think only of themselves and their own deaths.
Not what comes after.
They leave quite a mess.
They don't stick around to clean it up.
So you're not one of those depressed students from the university?
I don't like the word "depressed." l prefer to say that I'm in a tailspin.
A tailspin?
-Does this tailspin involve a man?
-Yes, it does.
But I'm not as crazy as I was up till yesterday.
Apparently that's due to the salutary effect of scent on the human psyche.
Its importance is, I believe, almost incalculable.
At the motel, I happened to use this soap.
It was provided to me as a courtesy as one of the guests.
That an economical motel would provide such good soap is quite unusual.
-The scent is very precise.
-Really?
Tell me if it provokes any particular reaction in your psyche.
A state of mind.
I always knew she was unstable.
They're gonna have her photo at the registrar's.
Violet!
Violet!
You're back!
You're okay!
Not really.
Oh, my gosh, Violet, we were so worried.
Why didn't you tell us or leave a note?
I did leave a note.
Would that be a suicide note?
-l wouldn't leave without a note.
-Where did you go?
I took the train to Villafranca and checked into a motel there.
-The Motel 6?
-No, the Motel 4.
-lt's even less expensive.
-The Motel 4 in Villafranca?
-My God, you really were suicidal.
-Why'd you go?
I had to do something.
And you really thought you were gonna find the answer in Villafranca?
I'm not sure what I expected, but I might have found it.
What?
Soap?
This scent and this soap is what gives me hope.
Hello?
is anyone here?
Hello?
Lily?
-Hello?
-Oh, my gosh.
I couldn't understand where everyone was.
Sorry, I just went out to get some things.
-Where's Alice?
-Gone.
What do you mean?
Left.
We broke up.
-But when you called, you said-- -l know, I'm sorry.
I thought it better to tell you in person.
Alice couldn't control her jealousy.
It completely overwhelmed her.
Really?
What was she jealous of?
Come on.
No, what?
You.
After a while, I just couldn't handle it.
Things became impossible.
She was jealous of me?
Of course.
Would it be okay if we watch a film?
Yes.
What would you like to see?
I thought maybe Truffaut's Baisers volés.
Stolen Kisses.
Do you know it?
No, is it new?
It's a classic of French New Wave cinema.
I think you'll like it.
-But it's in color?
-Yeah.
-You don't know Truffaut?
-No.
Do you know Godard, Á bout de souffle?
-Why was Alice so jealous?
-What do you think?
She was jealous because Lily's lovely.
I don't know.
They had a lot of problems.
Of course.
You wouldn't break up a happy couple.
-What's that?
-A note Frank left.
-Really?
Recently?
-No, when we were together.
Now that most correspondence is electronic it's rare to be left anything written by hand.
Frank can write by hand?
-What is it?
-lt's not very important.
It's just all I have.
-What's it say?
-"Out for brewskis.
Back in a giff."
What's a "giff"?
One of those little motor scooters, isn't it?
I'm sure he meant to write "jiff" with a J. "Back in a jiff."
But he wrote "giff."
-Could Frank be dyslexic?
-No.
Dyslexics are intelligent.
-What's that?
-Frank's bean ball.
-He gave you his bean ball?
-Not exactly.
This is an extra.
He thought he'd leave it here just in case he lost his other one.
Gosh, Violet, you've really gotta stop thinking about Frank.
Why?
I don't wanna stop thinking about him.
Recently I had a thought that cheered me up a lot.
Life is like a long, flowing river and as a long, flowing river, some debris you never expect to see again is almost certain to reappear floating to the surface.
Frank and I may very well be together again one day.
Maybe it'll take years, but somewhere down the line he's very likely to pop up again, and I'll be there to catch him.
I don't think we've spoken about this.
What?
Have you been to the south of France?
To the walled city of Carcassonne?
-l've never been anywhere.
-But you've seen pictures of it.
No, I don't think so.
Oh, it's fascinating.
-l'd like to visit.
-You never studied the Cathars?
They were a religious movement very idealistic located mostly in the southwest of France that the Catholic Church repressed.
Oh, my God.
The Catholic Church is, like, always bad.
Ideas can't be killed as easily as people.
Especially such enlightened ones as the Cathars held.
In recent years, more and more people have returned to their beliefs.
So you're a Cathar?
Yes. I aspire to be.
I'm trying to follow the path the Cathars marked out.
That's so impressive.
I can tell you we didn't have any Cathars back home.
I think you'd be surprised.
In the Cathar view the highest form of lovemaking avoids procreation entirely.
Sure.
Condoms, right?
Well, according to Cathar ideas sex with condoms is just a parody of the procreative act.
What do you mean?
The standard, cliché form of sexual intercourse is for the man to approach a woman from the front.
Cathar lovemaking, I think you'll find very fulfilling.
I'll be very careful, we'll go slowly.
It'll be a new experience but one which I think you'll find brings an inexpressible closeness.
Might your drinks-buying friend be around?
It would be great to get complimentary cocktails.
-Charlie?
No.
-Do you still see him at all?
-He calls from time to time.
-He does?
-Why don't you introduce us?
-Why should I introduce you?
Because you know him, and we don't.
So?
"So?"
"So" is probably the unkindest word in the English language.
I can't bear it. I think it should be outlawed. "So."
You're crazy.
Come on, Lily, you have Xavier.
-You can't keep two guys for yourself.
-Guys do that all the time.
We're not guys, fortunately.
It's unconscionable for you not to bring him and introduce us.
Charlie is a friend.
He's a nice guy.
What do you mean?
I hate to think what'd happen if you got your claws into him.
That's outrageous.
We're perfectly nice.
We've met lots of pathetic guys and nothing bad's happened.
-Charlie's not pathetic.
-Well, all the better, then.
The Roman Holidays will be coming soon.
-What's that?
-A festival Roman Letter Clubs put on.
A kind of moron jamboree.
The Roman elements are the worship of Bacchus, Beerus and Blotto.
-lt could've all been so uplifting.
-Charlie.
Hey, Charlie.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
-Have you the day off?
-Yeah.
This is my friend Charlie, whom I think I've mentioned.
And, Charlie, these are my roommates.
This is....
This is Rose.
And this is Heather.
And Violet.
Charlie works for Strategic Development Associates.
He's an associate there.
You work in strategic development?
-You've heard of it?
-Of course, yes.
My cousin Jay in Philadelphia works in strategic development.
Something business-related?
Mostly business, but any kind of organization.
-Only businesses pay the big bucks.
-Nonprofits and government pay well.
That's how they keep from having profits by paying lots of money to companies like yours.
Excuse me, but aren't you in Professor Ryan's course at the Ed School?
No.
You're not in Professor Ryan's Flit Lit course?
No.
-Flit Lit?
-The dandy tradition in literature.
-l'm sure I've seen you there.
-Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm not in any courses at the Ed School.
Good to meet you.
-lt was great to see you.
-Bye.
God, Violet, what was that about?
That guy is definitely in Professor Ryan's class.
Not possible.
He has a fulltime job for Strategic Development Associates.
He never got his coffee.
-Why lie about something like that?
-He's lying.
I find that very attractive.
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna stop cutting Professor Ryan's class.
It can be argued that Firbank was too little disciplined too unserious in his unseriousness to create works of enduring value.
But as a liberating influence on later writers such as Waugh his importance should not be discounted.
It's not Firbank's work itself but the idea of his work that so helped later writers as Thomas Love Peacock did in the previous century.
I'm not gonna come anymore.
-What a waste of time.
-Charlie.
Charlie.
-Charlie?
-Charlie, you are taking the course.
Charlie?
Who's Charlie?
-Fred, what's going on?
-Fred?
Fred. sounds like you got some explaining to do.
-Well, you were lying.
-l wasn't lying, I was making it up.
Why were you making it up?
If you were an eighth-year Ed School student, would you advertise that?
Eighth year. impressive.
But your whole life was a lie.
Dressing up in suits.
Buying people drinks.
The suits were real.
The drinks, real.
Not just drinks for people.
They were for cute girls.
There's a perfectly rational, easily explainable agenda.
So it was a playboy or operator move.
-Of course.
Transparently so.
-l admire that.
Drinks are expensive.
But strategic development, that was made up too?
-You said your cousin Jay was in it.
-What cousin Jay?
-ln Philadelphia.
-l don't have a cousin in Philadelphia.
You said your cousin Jay was working in strategic development.
I was just saying that to be friendly.
To make a kind of link.
-So your name's Fred something?
-Yes.
Fred something.
-Packenstacker?
-Oh, my God.
How crazy.
He's completely insane.
I almost dated him.
-You can say that about a lot of guys.
-l don't think he's crazy.
Making up an entirely fictitious identity, that's not crazy?
-lt's insane. it's psycho.
-Violet's identity is made up.
-l don't think she's crazy.
-No, I am.
No, this is different.
It's crazy and pathetic.
All that about strategic development he just made up.
Don't tell me that's not weird.
I've heard of strategic development.
I think it's something pretty important.
Violet, you're not gonna start going out with him.
You're not, are you?
Well, we had planned to go to the library.
-Not to the stacks, I hope.
-Yes.
Oh, my gosh, do you realize how dangerous that is?
-Dangerous?
-Yes, the stacks.
They're dark and deserted.
Anything could happen.
It's true.
With the study habits at Seven Oaks your body won't be found until spring.
Promise you won't go with him to the stacks.
Please.
Okay. I'll suggest the Randall Room.
-Don't suggest. insist.
-And please not at night.
Okay.
What are you reading?
Have you chosen a topic for your final paper?
The decline of decadence.
You think that decadence has declined?
Definitely.
Bigtime.
Major, major decline.
How?
How or in what ways?
Either.
Well, take the flit movement in literature, or homosexuality.
It's gone completely downhill, right down the tubes.
What do you mean?
Before, homosexuality was something refined, hidden aspiring to the highest levels of creativity and often achieving it.
Now it seems to be musclebound morons running around in T-shirts.
It's pretty disillusioning.
Are you gay?
Not especially, but in another era, it might have had some appeal.
-Now I just don't see the point.
-You might be romanticizing the past.
We'll never know.
The past is gone, so we might as well romanticize it.
You could be right.
I wanted to ask, how's Lily?
Lily.
She's okay.
Here, check it out.
A.L.A. Nope.
Hello.
Good afternoon.
Check it out.
The A.L.A. Heard of it?
We have a meeting on Tuesday.
-You should come by.
-What is the A.L.A.?
Just join us.
Come Tuesday.
I think you'll really like it.
So....
A fellow was passing these out, and invited us to a meeting on Tuesday.
The A.L.A.?
Oh, my God.
I thought it was something related.
No?
The A.L.A. has got nothing to do with us.
Can't you see that?
The way we express love has meaning.
It's in the context of something beautiful.
We're following our creator's teaching.
Aspiring to an ideal.
A beautiful one that brings an inexpressible closeness.
Not just to each other, but....
For the A.L.A., and those like them the love act is just hedonistic pleasure-seeking of a perverted nature.
I can't believe you'd think we had anything in common with them.
We don't.
Nothing, not an iota.
My God, can't you see that?
Lily.
Lily, come back.
Please.
Don't be that way.
-Oh, my gosh, Lily.
Are you okay?
-lt's all right.
You don't wanna talk about it?
I don't understand.
-You don't understand what?
-What is non-procreative lovemaking?
-lt could be a lot of things.
-Yeah, but in this case?
-We don't have to talk about this.
-l don't mind.
Could somebody explain what this is about?
Well, if--
Cathars don't believe in procreative sex.
They don't have intercourse the usual way.
The usual way?
-You don't have to talk about this.
-No, it's okay.
It's the normal way, from the front where you can have procreation not from the other side, where you can't.
The other side?
That's their religion?
No, but it's the direction their beliefs head in.
When they express love, that's what they do.
How horrible.
You poor girl.
What?
That's terrible what he obliged Lily to do.
Violet.
Can we talk?
You must be pretty mad at me.
No.
You're not?
Not really.
But it was so terrible how everything happened.
Your walking in on us.
Maybe it's easier that way.
That bitch!
I can't believe it. what a bitch.
-Priss?
-Of course Priss.
"l'm so stressed.
Sad.
Depressed.
I'm so tired. I'm fatigued."
She was so depressed she had to get everything her own way.
"l'm so stressed.
Frantic."
Man.
What a bitch.
Priss dumped you?
No. lt was mutual.
Oh, listen, I have a question.
You remember that bean ball that I left in your room?
Yeah.
Do you still have it?
Yeah.
Do you think I could get it back?
I lost the other one, and with everything that's happened I'd really like to have it.
Nothing like some bean ball after a breakup.
Yeah.
God, you're smart.
You always get it.
Whatever I say you understand.
Man.
Hey, Heather.
-Hey.
-Hey.
Hey.
Violet.
Violet, what's wrong?
I'm sorry.
Lily's lovely.
Now she's free.
Go. I understand.
Latin!
Et cetera!
-Yeah!
-Yeah!
This is what comes from not teaching Latin in the schools.
Yeah, it's moronic and boorish, but it's also kind of fun, don't you think?
No.
What's that stench?
I suppose this is what happens when decadence rots society from within.
And from without.
Such a society is, I fear destined to fail and be overrun.
Maybe that's good.
Finally. it's about time those cesspools were drained.
What color would you say that chair is?
That's a chair?
I have no idea.
-Guys have preferences.
-You're going to accept that?
-You're not going to do anything?
-There's nothing to be done.
-Fred must know his own mind.
-Oh, really?
-l seriously doubt that.
-Come on.
Lily's got that slender, delicately swelling beauty...
-...that no man can resist.
-Okay, you're probably right.
Poor Lily.
Just think of all Xavier put her through.
He just used her body.
And not even the right side.
Have you noticed that good people tend to have large posteriors?
Not everyone, by any means.
I know it's not logical.
But it does seem to be true.
The genetic link between morality and large posteriors?
Yes, I think that's well known.
You and Violet have that build.
It's nice.
You're still very attractive, but also sensible and moralistic.
I don't. I have narrow hips, but also no very strong principles.
Yes?
Oh, hi.
-Hi, Frank.
-Hey, Heather.
So I guess you guys all heard.
University's closing all the Roman Letter Houses.
Sorry.
This year's Roman Holidays did seem like the end of civilization but when civilization ends people are going to need a place to stay.
Man.
It's bad.
It's that bastard from The Complainer.
Someone from the administration's been reading it.
Hard to believe.
Bastard.
Listen we were wondering if you thought it would be okay if we stayed at the suicide center.
Okay, sure.
That sounds like a good stopgap measure.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So there's one more thing.
Remember that bean ball we talked about?
Yes.
You think I could pick that up?
Just after everything that's happened, it-- l could really use it right now.
Yes.
-What's that?
-What?
The note.
One gets so few things written by hand anymore, I guess I kept it.
"Out for brewskis, back in a giff."
What's a giff?
It's the scooter.
Like a Vespa, right?
-That's what I thought.
-l was thinking about getting one.
You must've meant "jiff." "Back in a jiff."
And then misspelled it, or spelled it in a nonstandard way.
Yeah.
Not a good speller.
Thanks.
You're great.
Priss was such a bitch.
Damn.
Hey, Heather.
Bye.
-Bye.
-Bye.
Heather is really cute.
She going out with anyone?
There might be something between her and Thor.
Thor?
Damn.
Heather and Thor?
Damn.
I'm worried about Thor.
It's hard for us to imagine how upsetting it is not knowing the colors.
It's impossible for me to imagine.
When Thor sees a rainbow, it's so much gibberish to him.
There was one this afternoon.
Oh, my gosh, he took it hard.
Recently, there was a parade in the city where the marchers carried rainbow-colored flags and banners.
Thor was so upset.
He had no idea what it meant.
What kind of retard is he?
See, that's the conclusion people jump to.
-Well, it is somewhat understandable.
-Not if you knew the full story.
What's the full story?
You know how parents love bragging about how precocious their children are?
Thor's parents had become precocity addicts constantly needing an ever-greater precocity fix.
He should've entered kindergarten.
They pushed him into first grade.
"Thor skipped a grade," they could tell.
What Thor's parents failed to consider is the work done in nursery school.
Key being the study of colors.
I suppose they just assumed that colors are knowledge people pick up.
Like, for example, not stepping on sidewalk cracks.
What's that?
I think Rose is sleeping.
Am I boring?
No, not at all.
When you have problems, it's great to hear someone else's idiotic ones.
Please go on.
-What?
-What you said about depressed people being mean, you weren't joking.
I'm sorry, you're right.
Please go on.
No.
I'm sorry.
You know how I am.
Please continue.
Thor decided he absolutely had to learn all the colors.
Both primary and mixed.
He's been hitting the books hard, and thought he'd mastered them.
Then, in town, he said, "That traffic light's blue."
I had to say, "No, it's green."
He was really upset.
Oh, hi, Lily.
Hi.
We were worried about you.
I can't bear this tension with Lily.
It's terrible to have the group divided this way.
Better not next to Robertson.
What?
Didn't you hear?
Ed students have been going up to the roof and throwing themselves off.
-But it's only two stories.
-Yes, I know.
It's terrible.
Not high enough to kill, but high enough to maim.
And particularly dangerous for anyone below.
I've got to forget about Fred.
But you really liked him.
This whole thing of a person meeting someone else first, it's so arbitrary.
-lt's terrible and cruel.
-l have to say, I was wrong about Fred.
I thought he was a playboy or operator type.
In fact, he's just another guy rendered helpless...
-...by the attentions of a pretty girl.
-Cary!
No, don't!
I love you!
-Why did you do that?
-Oh, my God!
Cary, I love you!
Isn't the Ed School essentially a teacher's college?
Yeah.
If they can't even destroy themselves how are they going to teach America's youth?
-What do you think you're doing?
-Sorry.
Did I disturb you?
Why are you wearing tap shoes?
You out of your mind?
-l think that's pretty clear.
-l'm so sick of that.
Oh, really?
I think it's cute.
Since you won't be treating us to one of your incompetent tap routines...
-...why don't you take those things off?
-No.
We'll do the routine.
Rose.
-Madge wants to see the routine.
-l don't want to see your routine.
-l asked you to take those off.
-We need a break.
Just briefly, please.
It's helpful to have an audience.
Rose, the music.
I'm gonna report you.
Suzanne.
For me, it'd be Madame Curie, Simone de Beauvoir...
-...and Margaret Sanger.
-Good.
Violet.
I would say Richard Strauss, Roderick Charleston and Chubbard Checker.
-Richard Strauss?
The composer?
-Yes, that was one of his posts.
I'm not familiar with the others.
Could you tell us who they are?
Yes.
Each one of these men started an international dance craze.
Richard Strauss, the waltz.
Roderick Charleston, the Charleston.
Chubbard Checker, known as Chubby the dance we know as the twist.
Why do you consider a dance craze important?
Dance crazes enhance and elevate the human experience bringing together millions of people in a joyous celebration of our God-given faculties and passing these modes of physical expression down through the generations.
Though not so much anymore.
I thought-- Well, I assumed that the Charleston was named after the city of Charleston.
No.
Though that misconception is quite widely held.
It was Roderick Charleston.
Usually, behind some great creative phenomenon there's a person, not a town.
This is so exciting.
It's really great, isn't it?
-Hey, could you guys help?
-Sure.
What's up?
We need help packing soap which we'll distribute to Doar Dorm residents.
Cool.
What would you say are effective means to fight depression?
Maybe some of your DU brothers have an idea?
-Beer?
-No.
Beer's a downer.
Cocktails.
Hard liquor and spirits is what really gives you a lift.
It's interesting what you say.
My cousin Jay is a medical officer in Philadelphia.
He says that alcoholism by which I mean chronic, excessive consumption of alcohol is the primary self-administered treatment for depression.
-Cool.
-No.
It leaves you much worse off than before.
Oh, no, not me.
I just boot and then I feel fine.
-By "boot" do you mean vomit?
-Yes.
No.
None of the effective anti-suicide treatments involve vomiting.
-Hygiene?
-Exactly.
It's very important.
That's why we have such hope in the wonder bar.
Do you know its scent?
Transformative, we think.
This is so exciting.
When should we go over there?
-l don't think there's any rush.
-l'd like to go soon.
Doar Dorm has the highest fatality rate, as well as the worst hygiene.
Highest suicide rate.
Fatality rate. lt's uncertain what percentage were intentional and how many were just due to unawareness of gravity's laws.
I can just see those guys getting the gold packages, opening them and finding the good-smelling soap inside.
The cute packaging should prove irresistible.
And once clean, they'll start to see the world with new eyes.
The change could be dramatic.
Doar Dorm could soon become Dior Dorm.
I doubt that, to be perfectly, absolutely honest.
I love the idea.
Dior Dorm.
I adore optimism, even when it's completely absurd.
-Perhaps especially then.
-Great.
Ready?
Let's go.
Let's hurry.
Let's not get our hopes up too high, Heather.
No, you said yourself, the wonder bar is transformative.
-Hey, Violet.
Hi.
-Hi.
-Where you going?
-Doar Dorm.
-Fred, hi.
-Hey.
Good one.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
I guess it wasn't realistic to expect Doar Dorm to turn into Dior Dorm overnight.
They wouldn't even open them.
They said without the soap, the discs wouldn't fly properly.
Are you coming Friday?
Violet's launching her dance craze.
Oh, really?
That's great.
-What's the dance?
-The Sambola.
The devil's dance.
-Oh, cool.
We'll go, right?
-Yes, I'd like to.
But I have several papers to finish.
But I'd like to.
Great.
Thanks, Gus.
I don't see how we're going to start a dance craze if no guys show up.
Most guys aren't very good with the dance-craze thing.
Very good news. I was just in my procrastination seminar and the two guys from Doar Dorm had showered.
It was clear they'd used soap.
Oh, my gosh, what a difference.
Seems they'd been throwing packages so energetically, a soap bar fell out.
The unfamiliar ivory-like object intrigued them and one thing led to another, and, well.... lt was just as you said.
Isn't that great?
-Oh, look, here's Jimbo.
-Jimbo doesn't count.
Where is everybody?
Aren't we gonna be late for Violet's dance craze?
You wanna go to that?
Yeah.
-You're kidding.
-No, I love dance crazes.
Gosh, you're strange.
But aren't we already late?
No, it's later on.
Like 1 0, I think.
I have to confess, I've started losing patience with Violet.
Depression calls for serious treatment.
Medication.
Psychopharmaceuticals.
Talk therapy.
Are those approaches effective?
Despite the medication and therapy Ed School students are still throwing themselves off Robertson Hall.
Violet's ideas might seem a little offbeat--
A little?
Oh, my God. I don't know how much you know about Violet but there's some pretty weird stuff.
You know, Violet.
Violet Wister.
It's not even her real name.
-lt isn't?
-No, it's Emily Tweeter.
When she was 1 1 , she went completely crazy and has had several relapses since.
So it's a little worrisome to have her counsel nearly suicidal individuals.
I can't believe it.
-What?
-Emily Tweeter.
In first grade, I had an enormous crush on a girl with that name.
-And you remember that?
-Yeah.
Pretty huge Dr. Zhivago stuff.
Any idea or even mention of her filled me with emotion.
I had a strange perspective on the world.
I don't think my brain was functioning properly.
Everything was a bit of a dream.
You think this was Violet?
You have any idea if Violet attended willamette Montessori?
In Portland?
-We didn't order these.
-Compliments of the guy at the bar.
It was so brutal how it ended between us.
I know I was too angry and a bit crazy but I thought that what we had was stronger than that.
That you would not just walk away after one disagreement.
It wasn't just that.
You mean my Cathar beliefs.
Well I am no longer a Cathar.
How is that possible?
It's been very difficult.
You've dropped your adherence to the Cathar faith?
-Yes, I have.
-Good.
Normally I'd be reluctant to comment on anyone's religion, but....
What?
I'm sorry. I guess-- l guess I'm a bit of a bigot. I just-- l could never take seriously any religion that worships on Tuesdays.
Major religions require worship on the weekend.
Friday, Saturday or Sunday.
I find it just really laudatory that people sacrifice their weekend time to worship God.
Having the Sabbath on Tuesday always seemed very bizarre to me.
It's not right.
You know what?
We'd better get to the Lone Star.
Why are you so concerned about that?
Well, it's not as if international dance crazes start every day.
We'd better hurry.
What's wrong?
Another fiasco.
Sometimes our struggle reminds me of the myth of Sisyphus.
-Who?
-The myth about the guy who pushes an enormous rock only to have it keep rolling back.
Oh, yeah.
What a knucklehead.
The important thing to remember is that he was mythical.
He never really existed.
Violet?
Did you spend any part of your education at Willamette Montessori?
In Oregon?
Why?
Sound like "tweaker."
Would you say today is very gray?
I'd say so.
Maybe blue-gray.
Yeah, no, that rings a bell now.
Bye.
I'm sorry.
Her name wasn't Emily Tweeter, but Lucy Wurlitzer.
They're not similar. I'm beginning to realize that the human memory is not the foolproof instrument we sometimes imagine.
What's worse, everyone knew about my obsession, including my parents those from whom I most wanted it kept.
So from your earliest years, you were already a playboy or operator type?
Yes. I suppose that's why secrecy seemed so desirable.
Violet, can we talk?
-What's the plural of doofus?
-Doufi.
Not doofuses?
You can say either.
"Doufi" respects the Latin root and is preferred.
"Doofuses" is also correct, although a bit inelegant.
-You've thought a lot about this.
-Yes, I've had to.
Why?
What is it?
I like Fred, he's a nice guy.
And I can see why you like him.
When I first met you and Rose, I thought you were the cool crowd.
And in many ways you are. I find your perfume and fashion sense excellent.
Thank you.
But there's a reason, I think why you are so strongly attracted to doufi.
And it's not an accident how different groups divide up.
Isn't that a rainbow?
-That's a rainbow!
-Thor.
No, Thor!
Thor, no!
Stop!
Please, stop!
He's headed for Robertson Hall!
Red.
Orange.
Yellow.
Green.
Blue. Indigo.
Hallelujah!
Lord God, thank you.
Education.
Education.
We can learn the subjects we set out to master no matter how hard or impossible they may seem.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I wasn't sure I was gonna make it.
Magenta.
Pink.
Mauve.
I miss my nice American friend.
No, you're mistaken.
-You go to London for four weeks?
-Six.
It's dangerous, parents letting children travel.
They send them off and they don't know what they'll be getting back.
I don't know what you're referring to.
You're not from London.
I'm from London.
I was there, now I'm here.
I'm from London.
I just miss my nice American friend.
Nice?
Nice?
Fine. I'm fine.
Those are not adjectives I like to use.
God gave us abilities.
He requires that we use them.
Good, better, best, excelsior, higher.
Only excellence can glorify the Lord.
Vulgarity is, in essence, blasphemous.
I'm sorry for what I was saying before.
Of course you're not linked to the doufi or even that such distinctions are valid.
No, don't apologize.
I probably do have a doufi orientation.
But behind coolness, isn't there a certain repressing squashing down, or lack of cultivation of one's humanity?
Oh, so you think that cool people have less humanity?
No, I don't think cool people are entirely inhuman.
Just enough to be cool.
In our society, there's all this propaganda in favor of uniqueness, eccentricity, et cetera.
But does the world really want or need more of such traits?
Aren't such people usually terrible pains in the neck?
What the world needs to work properly is a large mass of normal people.
I would like to be one of those.
Sorry.
But you'll still do the part?
Yeah, of course.
So do you know every number...
-...in every Fred Astaire movie?
-There were two in our school musical.
-l know those.
-Did performing those two numbers help you overcome feelings of discouragement and despair?
Absolutely.
Freak.
Hey, everybody, let's do the Sambola.

This will not lead anywhere.

Yes it is.
- But the paperwork ...
You're a good worker.
We have no complaints about it.
And this is the point:
this is exactly the reason we want to keep them, if you take your final exam.
But the possibility is not enough.
You have to want it.
We have no doubt that the physical and intellectual exactly for this job

Hey, look who's there!
Marco!
- Marco!
Hello!
- Come to us!
Huh?
- Come here!
Will not you hang with us a little?
Sit down and drink a beer.
- You know I do not drink.
Where are you going?
- Come on.
Sit less.
I'll see you tomorrow.
- Do not be such!
Eat your organic trash then.
- You made me eat this.
What's going on?
- Last year it was.
Teach you to write anymore?
- I do not know.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
Good morning.
I'm Jacob.

What is your name?
- I'm Mrs. Timiyan.
Come on!
Log in here!
Freeze!
Have big horns!
- Be careful with them.
Come on!

They know that they will be punched in the nose.
- Clear.
Do not you dare, that ...
Then, look to close Fast door!
Check whether closed nice.
It is not necessary to be so clean.

Stinks!
Give, I will do it.
- No, nothing.
Do not you have work to do?
Actually, I have.
Do not leave then.
- Okay.
Come here!
Are you OK?
I realized that Lola worked to 2 in the afternoon.
Catherine, do you?
- From 7 in the morning.
I'm afraid I have to work and Sundays during the harvest.
There is no other way.
And you, Christian?
Yesterday?
- Yes.
7 to 18:15.
- And the day before?
From 7 to 17.
Yesterday grain he boots?
- No, straw.
Before I check your notebooks,
I want to present you the new student probationer
It was alone would imagine, Jacob?
- Well
I'm Jacob Schaefer.
We want to know a little more.
Tell us a little about yourself.
I'm from Ludwigsfelde and ...
I started training for work in a bank, but I decided to quit.
What made you decide to be go about farming rather than banking?
I do not know.
It just was not my thing.
There is a great difference in pay between banks and farms.
And I think they are very conceited!
This too.
What earns a beginner bank clerk?
The first year you take about 800 euros per month
Sad but true.
And it will not change soon.
Bankers will always receive more.
than people in production.
I just want to say something:
responsible for areas authorized you instruct.
If they tell you to do something, do not reply:
"You can not command me, loser!"
Who said so?
- Does not matter.
"Loser?" Nobody would say so ...
- Reports me ...
I just wanted to make it clear
"Report to me?" What does it mean?
Or tell what you mean or do not say anything?
Beat him in the head, you should treat others with respect.
Otherwise, I have to cover it in your recommendations.
You go with Catherine.
Do not be afraid to come and get me ask if you have any questions.
All right.
Successful first day Jacob!
- Thank you.
Do not you take a shower today?
Damn it!
What pushed?
It is OK.
And to me it happened to me once.
Push it!
- What's happening?
Floods cause?
Push it!
Honestly!
- Well, nothing.
Well, let's go!
Hi.
- Hi.
I experienced the day?
- Of course.
You will go again tomorrow?
- Yes.
Something to eat?
- The table is.
Here you №18.
And Cola.
Five euros, please.
Thank you.
Bye.
- Bye.
Marco?
Oh, hello.
- What's up?
Well, how are you?
- Good and you?
Great.
Thank you.
I was thought to come for more beer.
Want one?
- No thanks.
OK I understand.
Prefer sweet things, right?
- Yes, you know me.
Is everything okay with the work?
Yes.
A life in general?
- All right.
Do you know the girls?
- No.
Hello.
- Hi.
Maybe another time.
- Okay.
See you soon.
- Goodbye.
Good night.
- Goodbye.
Have you ever had problems?
- Actually, no, knock on wood.
What does "really"?
- Do not take unnecessary risks with them.
As we come and see that one cows hopping left and right or ears and sharpened or her head tilted side then we know that something's wrong.
We must be careful if you have a calf.
But nobody happened to him so far, knock on wood.
Now what?
- No, not there.
This right to your knee.
Disconnect the two wires.
They are not under pressure?
- No.
Do not be afraid.
Not under tension.
Simply disconnected from the insulators.
Exactly.
Now pull them behind your car or sideways.
And so it is.
- Is it OK?
Not so far.
Then you will go kilometers on foot to get them back.
This is a breeding bull.
I fed him by hand.
Says Philip.
More young.
Only 2 years old.
Two years?
- Yes.
Philip.
Philip!
What's on your mind again?
Come here.
Come here.
Philip.
Good boy.
Are not you afraid?
- No, Philip knows me.
Not you, boy?
You see small, red with white tip on the tail?
This may be a new bull.
I'll watch him.
If we can not catch him, I will ride my little faster and when the calf tail lift, Stretch try to catch it.
Right?
Here.
This is the new calf.
Now we just have to recognize that the mother is in a good mood or not.
See how run.
Now I have to drive faster.
- What should I do?
Wait!
Give me those pliers!
Now we need to ...
Oh no!
I forgot my things.
Relax, Abuela!
What's that?
- 49084.
And if I come down?
I never took things.
Get out of the car now. take this with you!
Quietly, Philip!
What to do?
- Follow me!
I will try to catch the calf.
If the cow to leave me, do so and say, "Get out!"
But do not run away!
Calm, calm ...
Get out, get out!
Right?
- Yes, yes, exactly.
Go away!
- Easy now ...
Watch her mouth is closed.
I do not want us slobbering purposes.
Go away.
Calm!
Calm!
Watch cow, not me!
Pull now!
Calm.
Everything is fine.
Do not go mad now!
Calm!
Everything is fine!
Well, let's go.
Done.
Probably a little afraid when alone?
Yes.
Everyone chasing little shubeto.
You will open my gate?
You have to come down here.
Close the door!
Close the door!
Otherwise will tremble.
Hang them again?
- To catch them.
Look at you!
It was scary, right?
- Yes, of course.
Hi Jacob.
What's up?
Is everything alright?
Good morning.
- Hello.
Hi, Holger.
Now the rest!
First we will include battery to check tension.
If animals touch it receive a slight electric shock.
And if I touch it?
- You will get a shock.
Powerful?
- Wait a minute.
Keep it here.
- Yes.
Take this leaf and lightly touch the wire.
Nothing is going to happen.
Pretty nasty electric shock.
Now imagine how they feel cows touch it with wet snouts.
That was fun, right?
- Found its new victim.
Exactly.
New victim.
Easily tied.
Bye.
See you soon.
- Goodbye.
Do you want?
Mrs. Timmy stabilyaga, right?
But getting up early and so ...
Hard work is.
Sailing our ever?
Yes.
To where?
To Tunisia.
With my parents.
Are you studying for exams and practice?
You should.
But instead go to Lemkayten.
What is that?
Lake.
- Lake?
Wait a minute.
What others have done them?
Do you have a girlfriend?
You threw the eye of one?
- No, not yet.
All?
How to tell ...
I had someone, but it was not available.
Rather internet teaser.
Internet?
Chat room?
- Yes.
Why do not you get?
Really I do not know.
Well, you'll find someone.
Super.
Nice house!
Well, thank you.
- No problem.
Have a good evening!
Do you have a tank there?
- Yes.
Will look.
Where is this thing?
- Further.
Attention!
Attention!
The tank could not be located!
Do you live alone?
- No, in a shared apartment.
I gave a further 17.
- And your parents?
My mother was constantly drunk.
I had to move out.
... And your father?
Not worth to mention it.
What are you staring at?
Do you have a problem?
I do not have.
You're Zver me.
What is the problem?
Soon you'll have one foot!
Go!
Get out!
So you're thinking, right?
- Stay a little coffee?
Will have drained whatever.
What happens if you merge blonde with a husky?
Blonde and husky?
I have no idea.
Or stupid dog or ninth song bitch.
Would me the ashtray?
What is Mrs. Butch?
- Mrs. Butch?
It is like our second mother all of us.
Did you odeve?
I had a small scratch and: "Oh, let him namazhem drug "
It is great.
I helped me get back driver's license.
They took my book for four years.
- What have you done?
I drove drunk.
Caught me on the border.
They opened the door and fell inside two bottles of vodka.
Seriously?
- We were five.
Me me out of the car and they took my blood sample on the spot.
Shit!
It helped me when squabbling with her mother.
I do not get along with her boyfriend and she threw me out of the house.
So, no place to live.
And she let me settle an apartment.
Right here in Yenikendorf.
One-room apartment.
I will not find anything so fast without her help.
You also may want I will take it from Dad.
Really bad.
- Hey, it could've been worse.
Back to work, guys.
Hey!
Are you ready?
Is it OK?
- Slight right.
Exactly.
I hooked it.
- Now connect both hose.
Yes, those.
Contact them over there ..
One there.
Just push it hard.
Come on.
Before it reached us.
- What?
Before flow is reached the tractor.
Well, let's go.
I might stay here for a while.
- Why?
I do not know, I like it here.
- You want to stay here?
All right.
I'm out.
Will go ...
Excuse me, do you know where Mrs. Butch?
Mrs. Butch is in the conference room.
- Thank you.
Here it is explained how to write a report.
And your success so far It has reached the requirements.
Few have to admit to preliminary exam.
Hello.
- Jacob?
I can come back later.
- No, go.
Marco difficulties writing reports.
And I'll have to do it.
- What?
To write reports.
Everyone is obliged to write.
If you think school is over while you practice, I will disappoint.
Mark, could you gave him several sheets to try and he?
Sit down.
Do not despair so easily.
- Not too many, right?
Do not, for example, when you were the mill processing carrots.
So you can describe the technology process there in his report.
Writing reports, is not different by writing an essay in school.
And you should do the same only for plowing.
Your report should be focus on plowing, to show that you understand all stages of this activity.
Why should I write about?
Now I do it for the fifth time.
Exactly because of that.
Nobody will read it so why write it?
I will read it to check if he understood everything.
And finally you yourself will understand better.
But I will not read it.
And you must write such reports to be admitted to the final exam.
Let me help you?
- No.
Imagine that you go to the bank and all they say:
"This stupid farmer can not even to write".
That's how things are.
Imagine that you give a document and you can not even understand it.
Now let's finish this sentence.
Will not do it!
No!
Will not do it!
Here's your paper.
Come on!
Now take a piece of paper ...
- This is stupid!
Hey!
Man, his heavy!
I see.
- What?
I see.
- I thought so.
Stop.
Come here.
Hold it!
Hey!
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Can I come in?
- Of course.
Does it work?
I have no idea.
All right.
Stop!
I would like to travel somewhere.
In Poland or Berlin.
What are you doing in Poland?
- I do not know.
To see something new.
Rather, I went to Berlin.
But it's so expensive ...
Is everything alright?
What's wrong?
Fuck you with me?
Tell me, what's wrong.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Jakob.
You do not lightly dressed?
Well, how's it going?
Do you work?
Yes of course.
- But it is hard work, right?
Getting up early, due to burrowing of shit and so on ...
No, it is normal.
Everything else okay?
- Yes.
You see with others?
- Yes, we're fine.
All right.
To pick it up then.
Jacob comes to you.
Where is Mark?
- I have no idea.
Jacob!
Jakob.
What are you doing here?
I have been waiting for you.
Where were you?
Today I had the exam.
Where are you going this car?
I just wanted to drive somewhere.
Where?
I have no idea.
Where you want.
Two beers please.
Thank you.
I do not drink alcohol.
What?
And why?
What are you doing?
It seems silly.
Do not look at me!
What is that?
Awesome!
For freedom!
Do you think I cope with exam?
- I have no idea.
I do not think.
And what if you have taken it?
Then I'll be fully qualified farmer.
Will you stay here?
Where else to go?
I do not know - in Berlin.
- Never!
My dad ran in Berlin.
I have not seen him.
And you like it?
What?
- Internship.
More exciting than I expected.
You are drunk!
- No, I am not.
You are drunk!
I do not drink as much as you.
I'm not drinking anything.
Watch out!
Will take to stumble.
Come to me!
Wait!
To walk on.
You are drunk.
Were there any cigarettes?
How will you get home?
I do not know.
Walk.
It was cool.
Carefully.
Jacob?
Where were you?
Good morning.
At home.
I came home late last night.
See what time it is.
Late.
Where were you yesterday?
- I was ill.
We had our first call.
- To know.
I should have zvannesh.
Run job now.
Wait wait.
Have you seen Mark?
- No.
Why?
I have not seen and Marco today.
I have no idea where he is.
He took his exam.
Tell him, If you see it, right?
Goodbye.
- Bye.

Previously on Nikita:
We have to stop Division, and to do that, we need to find the black boxes.
They contain evidence of every job Division has done.
I help you get the black box if you help me get the man who ordered my family's death and now has men hunting me.
Our arrangement concerns the black boxes.
We heard a rumor that Nikita has one.
- Can you verify that?
- She doesn't.
Guardian's not here.
I take it our target wasn't present.
- He cleared out recently.
- Hmm.
Near miss.
I don't get it.
All the signs were right.
Shadow bank account, movement patterns.
- Guardian should have been here.
- Perhaps he took a trip a weekend getaway.
Guardians don't take trips.
They don't do anything but stay at their posts and guard their black boxes.
Well, you are the expert.
Not that we have anything to show for that.
You got something to say?
Just that our business arrangement hasn't been good business, Mr. Elliot.
Gogol has given you time, money, resources, and what have you given us?
The limited pleasure of your company?
- Look, I--
- No more excuses, Mr. Elliot.
You will find and destroy the remaining black boxes.
I expect proof of real progress soon.
Until that time you may consider our business up for review.
Nikita?
What are you doing here?
- Gogol?
- Now, hold on.
Ari Tasarov?
!
- It's not what you think.
- Really'?
!
What I think is that you are working with a Russian blackops group whose top priority is killing me.
I know this looks bad.
But Ari wants Percy dead just as much as we do.
I'm not working with Gogol, Nikita.
I'm using them.
Oh, where have I heard that before?
Nikita, I would never let them hurt you.
I made it very clear, they even breathe in your direction I'm ripping their heads off, starting with Ari.
Now really, what are you doing here?
I need your help.
You do?
To get a black box.
I lost mine.
Lost it?
How?
Amanda.
What do you mean, you can't find Alex?
According to internal surveillance records she's been off campus for 84 hours.
She left her phone here, so no way to contact or trace her.
What about the NRO's search grid?
Anything from their systems?
No, nothing.
I'm sorry, but isn't Alex technically a free agent?
Shouldn't she be free to come and go as she likes?
Yes, of course, but after Gogol tried to kill her we all agreed the safest place for her was within these walls.
Something extraordinary must have happened to make her leave.
I need to make sure she's okay.
She accessed a series of satellite images focused just outside Moscow.
The Udinov mansion, her childhood home.
Why would she be looking at that?
Currently it's the residence of the man she intends to kill.
Knowing Alex, she's in Russia already.
Andrei Abramov?
I don't speak Russian.
But I understand you're used to dealing with an international clientele.
Heh.
What are you looking to buy?
Shoes?
Purses?
I just got some Gucci.
Guns.
Ammo.
Now, I'm gonna need a Glock 26 with a 9-millimeter suppressor five boxes of frangible rounds and five boxes of hollow points.
And a knife with a black blade.
I know Gogol's supposed to be the enemy.
But that's when we were with Division.
Sides aren't the same anymore.
Gogol is dangerous.
That could be good for us.
Nikita, we don't have a lot of friends left.
You think you're the first person who's tried to take advantage of them?
Percy tried it.
Even he got burned.
What do you mean, Percy got burned?
What are you talking about?
Operation Pale Fire.
Division collaborated with Sergei Semak to kill Nikolai Udinov and his family.
Pale Fire?
It was the first time I ever defied my orders.
I saved the daughter, Alexandra.
Alexan--?
Alex?
Your partner?
That's why she's working with you to take down Division.
Well, her focus has shifted.
She's headed somewhere dark.
And I'm as much to blame for that as anyone.
Why doesn't she trust you anymore?
All right.
You take the bed, I'll take the couch.
If we're gonna take down Gogol, we're gonna need our rest.
Or at least I will.
Ever since I got off the Regimen, I sleep all the time.
Human again, huh?
Oh, yeah.
It kind of sucks.
Owen, just to be clear, Gogol is not the priority anymore.
Black box is.
You got near a guardian.
What happened to him?
I don't know.
But whatever he's up to, it can'!
be good.
Tofu scramble.
Tarragon's the key.
A little bit of saffron.
You'll love it.
Owen, seriously this is so yum.
- Yeah?
- Heh, yeah.
Thanks.
What does Michael make for you?
It's been a long time since someone's made breakfast for me.
Speaking of which, where is your scruffier half?
He's figuring some stuff out.
You wanna call him?
I want you to tell me about this guardian.
His name is Patrick Miller according to the records at the bank where he stashed his box.
I used Gogol's computers to scan accounts using my search parameters.
I gotta tell you, those Gogol techs... they could give your little guy a run for his money.
Anyways, we got a hit.
By the time I got there, he had, uh, closed his accounts.
- Raided his farmhouse.
Cleared out.
- He leave anything behind?
Nothing.
Place was clean.
Well, we'll double-check.
You don't know that.
- What?
- Nothing, I just--
I'd forgotten how bossy you can be and, well, I kind of missed that.
Shut up.
Something still bugs me.
Guardians never leave their posts.
Not ever.
Unless they get a direct order from Percy.
Percy's locked up in Division.
He can't be doing that, not in the position he's in now.
Take everything out.
All of it.
"Reversed garment," eight letters.
You know, I have to say, I've never been a fan of word games.
I find they favor the literal-minded.
Human puzzles, on the other hand, intrigue me.
For instance, why would you tell Alex where to find Sergei Semak?
You knew that would motivate her to attempt an iii-advised mission of revenge.
At this point, isn't Semak's death something we all want?
Percy, my timetable is very specific.
Removing him before Alex is ready to take over Zetrov could do more harm than good, which you also know.
That is why you're being punished.
And I was so hoping to get the credenza to complete the set.
Alex could die in this attempt.
I have faith in Alex.
She's very resourceful.
Which brings me back to, why are you trying to kill Semak?
And don't give me that story about how you handed him Zetrov and he turned against you.
Hmm.
Just like old times, isn't it?
Turncoat.
"Reversed garment," eight letters.
What about Alexandra Udinov?
Have you found her yet?
No, but most of my resources have been assigned to finding the black boxes.
Which just means you're failing on two fronts.
After our assassination attempt it's safe to assume that Alexandra has gone into hiding.
She's probably cowering in some Division cave in no position to cause any sort of trouble.
- And moss always grows on...?
- The north side of the tree.
And the forest?
Pinsky Forest covers half a million acres 1000 are the property of the Udinovs.
I know all this, Papa.
Why are we doing this all again?
I need to have complete confidence in your abilities.
I know, because the only person I can depend on is myself.
I promise, I won't trust anyone.
There is a difference between dependence and trust.
Depend on yourself, but there will come a time when you must trust others.
And that is not bad.
You must have people close to you the way I have your mother and Uncle Sergei.
I do not want you to live your life alone, Alexandra.
I told you, I went through everything.
Regimen case.
It's empty.
I already checked it.
You said Percy used to send you your supply of Regimen.
Yeah.
Then where's the guardian getting his drugs from?
- Can't be Percy.
- It's not like ordering cough syrup.
You can't just pick up Regimen at the local drugstore.
He'd need a specialist, a doctor or a chemist.
The notes I got from Dr. Mars' lab list the chemicals needed to make it.
Gives us a shot at tracking anyone who ordered shipments of them.
Complicated trace.
Cross-reference a database of supply outlets with a list of scientists, legit, black-market.
Good thing you know someone who can do that.
Like you said, they could give Birkhoff a run for his money, right?
- Are you talking about Gogol?
- That's right.
Just so I'm clear, when I decide to use Gogol resources, I'm stupid.
But when you decide to do the same thing, it's a brilliant plan.
You made the deal with the devil.
I'm getting the biggest bang for our buck.
Okay, but you said it yourself, Ari's dangerous.
What if he decides to use this info?
What if he cuts me out of the process?
Which is why you won't let that happen and you'll go in person.
What about Birkhoff, huh?
He could run this, couldn't he?
Possibly, but not as quickly.
This is--
This data is Gogol's backyard.
It'll be at their fingertips.
And Birkhoff needs some time to himself to recover.
Recover?
From what, gamer's thumb?
Amanda captured him, tortured him.
She, uh, crushed his hand.
You Okay?
I'm fine.
No, really.
Are you okay?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Every time I feel like I've got a handle on one part of my life another part of it slips away.
I finally get Michael and I lose Alex.
We get the black box and I lose Michael.
It's like rounding up marbles on a glass table.
And if I lose focus for even one second, someone gets hurt, someone I love.
Birkhoff, Ryan.
Who am I gonna lose next, you?
I'm so tired.
I don't want to hurt anyone anymore.
What do you want?
I want to stop.
I don't think you can.
You have to help people.
You have to stand up for those people who can't fight for themselves because, Nikita, it's the right thing to do.
Division they gave you 6 gm-
When they gave you the ability to kill they also gave you the ability to protect.
You taught me that.
I don't know if Michael's coming back.
I think...
I don't know if Michael's coming back.
You know, if he can't see what he left behind then maybe you shouldn't be together.
I believe Mr. Elliot can still help us.
He's an ex-guardian.
It's a very unique skill set.
And yet the black boxes are still out there, threatening me.
I have a suggestion on that front.
When we find a box perhaps we should consider other options besides simply destroying it.
- What do you mean?
- The boxes are a record of every illegal covert operation Division has ever conducted.
The information is so damaging to the Americans that they can't wait to destroy them.
Now, at the very least, that suggests that we should have a look inside.
See if there's anything that can help us.
Too dangerous.
If the truth that I was behind Nikolai Udinov's death were to come out...
No, no loose ends.
Well, then perhaps you'd like me to take care of that other loose end.
Take care with your tone, Ari.
You are treading on dangerous ground.
MY apologies.
I meant no disrespect.
But we have many enemies, sir, and I believe that in the right hands a black box would be a very powerful weapon against them.
It could be the key to ensuring Zetrov's future.
Except we don't have one.
I know how to get you a black box.
Alexandra.
Come on, Alexandra.
Papa?
You are not alone.
Sir, the search index is complete.
Based on chemical shipments, Spider has turned up three leading chemists in the Western European region.
Uh, we have one in Cadiz, Spain another in Palermo, Italy, the last in Basel, Switzerland.
Basel's close to Colmar.
It's gotta be the one.
The candidate is one Werner Christinger.
He's a professor of chemistry at Basel Institute of Technology.
Uh, specializes in Neuropharmacology.
Looks like he's handled some black-market requests as well.
Like the Regimen.
I'm on my way.
I have a team in Germany, they can be there in under an hour.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's not how it works.
I find the guardian, I destroy the box.
Oh, we're not going to destroy the box.
Not immediately.
I'm sending a retrieval team.
- That's not the deal.
- New deal.
Employer's prerogative.
The chemist is a Werner Christinger from the Basel Institute of Technology.
- But there's a Gogol team on its way.
- On its way from where?
Germany.
So it's close.
I'd never make it back on time.
You've gotta get there first.
I'm on it.
Hey.
It's me.
You should know Nikita's closing in on the black box.
And she's making the approach solo.
Bring Mr. Elliot with us.
His knowledge of the box and the guardian may still prove to be useful.
Thank you, Papa.
Amsterdam.
Amsterdam.
Acknowledged.
Do you have black box?
- Aye.
Good.
Keep it secure.
You'll receive further instructions after you rendezvous with the guardians.
I'm on my way.
Just about to pick up the last of my Regimen.
Is my order ready?
Yes.
One hundred count of each.
Just as you'd asked.
Hands.
Hands!
Take the black box out.
Slowly put it on the table.
Slowly.
Step away.
You, grab the box.
Bring it to me.
Sir, we have visuals.
Taking them out.
Gogol.
- Yes?
- Local authorities have custody of the target and the box.
The authorities?
Who alerted them?
It seems the chemist was under observation for his illegal activities.
Once the shooting started DARE units were called in.
Also, they have Nikita.
She was with them.
They're being transported to Zurich.
Follow them.
Call in Teams 2 and 3 for backup.
We'll be there shortly.
Nikita.
Well, now we know the answer to who you were calling.
Not that that's a surprise.
For such a highly-trained operative, Mr. Elliot, you're absurdly transparent.
A single-celled organism.
It's no wonder Percy assigned you to watch a box.
Now, Nikita is perhaps the most complex individual I have ever come across.
I honestly don't know what she sees in you.
We share a common interest.
We both can't wait to kill you.
Yuri, over here.
But if we give Americans what they want, they might help us in the future.
The Americans are being bullies, and bullies only respond to strength.
But Sergei, enough business, huh?
Heh, it's a beautiful day.
You are coming over for Easter, yes?
Katya is making a kulichi.
- I don't know, uh--
- What is it?
Heh, not another woman?
No, not a woman.
But, uh, Easter is meant for families.
And, uh, you should be with yours.
You're right, Easter is for families.
So shall I tell Katya you will arrive by noon?
You're truly blessed, Nikolai.
You have a fine house, a beautiful wife, a loving daughter.
Someday you'll have all that.
Until then, you're stuck with us.
How did you find me?
Did you intercept a call?
Communication tap?
Right.
You ran a good stack.
Hard cover was solid.
But you were using a modified Weaver, when you--
What are you doing?
Tactical breakdown.
Back at the lab.
- We're not friends or partners.
- No.
But we're professionals.
- We're nothing.
- You're Division.
Was Division.
Right.
You're the rogue.
Why did you leave?
Because I realized what Division really was.
Do you even know what it is that you're guarding?
What's on that box?
I worked it out.
The box?
It's important to Percy.
Which means ifs leverage.
It's power.
I'm not stupid, I know what Division is.
It's a giant criminal organization.
Granted, one that plays on a world stage but the principles, they're all the same as any local racket.
There will be a payout, a massive one in this case for anyone who can keep their head low, know which player to get behind.
My bet's on Percy.
So yes, I know what the box is.
It's a golden ticket.
You chose the wrong side to back.
Percy's rotting in a hole in Jersey.
He's finished.
What?
You really have no idea what's going on, do you?
Who's on the wrong side now?
Make sure the van is clean.
- No loose ends.
- Understood.
Mr. Elliot has outlived his usefulness.
Make sure he's non-operational.
I have the box.
It's about time.
Bring it straight to the house.
- No stops.
- On my way.
There's three more.
Go.
- Thanks.
- Thanks for calling.
Nikita's in the van.
Guys.
He's gone.
So how's Max?
He's good.
He asked about you actually.
Called you tsiotsya s pistaletam.
-"The Gun Lady."
- Yeah, well...
-...at least you made an impression.
- Ha, ha, yeah.
How's Birkhoff?
He's better.
He needs some time.
Yeah, well, he's tough.
He'll be annoying the hell out of you in no time.
And you?
How are you?
I'm glad to see you.
We have to go.
The guardian's on the move.
He doesn't have the box.
And Ari's probably destroyed it by now.
No.
Ari told me he wants to keep it.
They must think they can use it for something.
We got a bigger problem.
The police confiscated this laptop from the guardian.
I took it when we left the scene.
Guardians are on secondary protocol.
Wait.
What are you talking about?
All right.
Primary protocol is to stay put, guard the box.
Secondary protocol is to pull stakes and report to a designated location and await further instructions.
Percy instituted it a few years back.
- Why he cleared out of the farmhouse.
- Who can initiate secondary protocol?
- Only Percy.
- That's impossible.
He's locked up.
What location?
Where are they going?
I don't know.
It was to be given by verbal command.
Which is why we've got to get going, start tracking the guardians.
They're gathering.
Percy's behind it.
We don't know if there's anything happening with Percy.
What we do know is Ari has the box, we need it back.
It's biometrically sealed.
They can't decrypt it without the guardian's blood.
Which is why the box isn't an issue.
The box is always an issue.
Okay.
I'll go after the guardian, you go after Ari.
And you'll be fine with him.
No, Michael goes with you.
- What?
- Hold on.
There are at least three guardians.
You're outgunned.
It's gonna take both.
Nikita, I just got here.
I can't leave you now.
- This isn't about us.
- You have no way of finding Ari.
Yeah, she does.
When Ari started threatening me, I figured I'd keep tabs.
I put a tracker on his car.
Michael, we'll have the time to deal with this all later.
You realize every law-enforcement agency is on high alert.
And you're chasing Ari Tasarov into the heart of Gogol territory.
You don't know where he's headed.
Yes.
But ifs the right thing to do.
You're right.
I don't know what I'm going to find there.
Uncomfortable?
It's hard to go back.
It's not my first choice.
Mine either.
But it was necessary.
However, punishment is only effective if there's an opportunity for rehabilitation.
I'm willing to restore some of your privileges if you tell me everything you told Alex.
Where she's getting her resources, who she's working with how much she really knows about Semak.
Let's start again.
I told her she needs to think about her future.
And in order to do that, she needs to be completely clear-eyed about her past.
After all can't know where we're going until we know from where we came.
It's not an easy journey.
It can be painful.
Arduous.
But if we have the courage to face the truth it could lead to the right path.
That's something we all seek.
You expect Alex to have some kind of revelation?
Clarity.
Our memories can be unreliable narrators.
You may think you know with absolute certainty what's in your past and then you find out you don't know the past at all.
Alexandra?
Mama?
Previously on Nikita...
We have to stop Division,and to do that, we need to find the Black Boxes.
They contain evidence of every job Division has ever done.
I help you get the Black Box, if you help me get the man who ordered my family's death and now has men hunting me.
Our arrangement concerns the Black Boxes.
We heard a rumor that Nikita has one.

They don't do anything but stay at their posts and guard their Black Boxes.
Well,you're the expert...

You will find and destroy the remaining Black Boxes.

Well,Percy's locked up in Division.
He can't be doing that,not in the position he's in now.
Take everything out.
All of it.
"Reversed garment," eight letters.
You know,I have to say,I've never been a fan of word games.
I find they favor the literal-minded.
Human puzzles,on the other hand,intrigue me.
For instance,why would you tell Alex where to find Sergei Semak?
You knew that would motivate her to attempt an ill-advised mission of revenge.
At this point,isn't Semak's death something we all want?
Percy,my timetable is very specific.
Removing him before Alex is ready to take over Zetrov could do more harm than good, which is something you also know.
That is why you're being punished.
And I was so hoping to get the credenza to complete the set.
Alex could die in this attempt.
I have faith in Alex.
She's very resourceful.
Which brings me back to...
Why are you trying to kill Semak?
And don't give me that story about how you handed him Zetrov and he turned against you.
Hmm,just like old times,isn't it?
Turncoat.
"Reversed garment," eight letters.
What about Alexandra Udinov?
Have you found her yet?
No,but most of my resources have been assigned to finding the Black Boxes.
Which just means you are failing on two fronts.
Sir,after our assassination attempt, it's safe to assume that Alexandra has gone into hiding.
She's probably cowering in some Division cave, in no position to cause any sort of trouble.
- And moss always grows on?
- The north side of the tree.
And the forest?
seven***
Pinsky forest covers half a million acres, 1,000 of which are the property of the Udinovs.
I know all this,papa.
Why are we doing this all again?
I need to have complete confidence in your abilities.
I know,because the only person I can depend on is myself.
I promise,I won't trust anyone.
There is a difference between dependence and trust.
Depend on yourself, but there will come a time when you must trust others, and that is not bad.
You must keep people close to you, the way I have your mother and your Uncle Sergei.
I do not want you to live your life alone,Alexandra.
perimeter***
I told you,I went through everything.
Regimen case...
It's empty.
I already checked it.
Owen,you said that Percy used to send you your supply of the regimen,right?
Yeah.
Then where's the guardian getting his drugs from?
Can't be Percy.
It's not like ordering cough syrup.
You can't just pick up regimen at the local drugstore.
You need a specialist...
A doctor or a chemist.
The notes I got from Dr. Mars' lab list the chemicals needed to make it.
That's good...
That gives us a shot at tracking anyone who's ordered shipments of them.
It's a complicated trace.
He'd have to cross-reference a database of supply outlets with a list of scientists...
Legit,black market.
Good thing you know someone who can do that.
Like you said,they could give Birkhoff a run for his money,right?
- Are you talking about Gogol?
- That's right.
Just so I'm clear,when I decide to use Gogol resources,I'm...
I'm stupid.
But when you decide to do the same thing,I-it's a brilliant plan?
Hey,you're the one who made the deal with the devil.
I'm just trying to get us the biggest bang for our buck.
Okay,but you said it yourself...
Ari is dangerous.
W-what if he decides to use this info?
What if he decides to cut me out of the process?
Which is why you're not gonna let that happen,and you're gonna go in person.
What about Birkhoff,huh?
Birkhoff could run this,couldn't he?
Possibly,but not as quickly.
This is...
This data is Gogol's backyard.
It'll be at their fingertips.
And...
Birkhoff needs some time to himself to recover.
"Recover"?
From what... gamer's thumb?
Amanda captured him,tortured him.She...
She crushed his hand.
You okay?
Fine.
No,really.
Are you okay?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Every time I feel like I've got a handle on one part of my life,another part of it slips away.
I finally get Michael,and I lose Alex.
We get the Black Box,and I lose Michael.
It's like...
Rounding up marbles on a glass table.
And if I lose focus for even one second,someone gets hurt...
Someone I love.
Birkhoff...
Ryan.
Who am I gonna lose next...
You?
I'm so tired.
I don't want to hurt anyone...
Anymore.
What do you want?
I want to stop.
I don't think you can.
You have to help people.
You have to stand up for those people who can't fight for themselves,because,
Nikita,it's the right thing to do.
Division...
They gave you a gift.
When they gave you the ability to kill, they also gave you the ability to protect.
You taught me that.
I don't know if Michael's coming back.
I think...
I don't know if Michael's coming back.
You know,if... if he can't see what he left behind,
maybe you shouldn't be together.
I believe Mr. Elliot can still help us.
He's an ex-guardian.
It's a very unique skill set.
And yet the Black Boxes are still out there threatening me.
I have a suggestion on that front.
When we find a Box,perhaps we should consider other options besides simply destroying it.
What do you mean?
The Boxes are a record of every illegal covert operation Division has ever conducted.
The information is so damaging to the Americans that they can't wait to destroy them now.
At the very least,that suggests that...
Maybe we should have a look inside,see if there's anything there that can help us.
Too dangerous.
If the truth that I was behind Nikolai Udinov's death were to come out...
No.No loose ends.
Well,then perhaps you'd like me to take care of that other loose end.
Take care with your tone,Ari.
You are treading on dangerous ground.
My apologies.
I meant no disrespect.
We have many enemies,sir,and I believe that in the right hands, a Black Box would be a very powerful weapon against them.
It could be the key to ensuring Zetrov's future.
Except we don't have one!
I know how to get you a Black Box.
East sector is clear.
Hold on.
Found the breath.Taking a look.
This is Unit2.The north sector is clear.
Hold on¡­
Must have been an animal.
Return to base.
Understood.
When will they recalibrate these thing¡­ so not every stray rabbit sets them off?
Alexandra.
Come on,Alexandra.
Papa?
You are not alone.
Yes.
Sir,this is the day watch at the mansion.
We registered an outer perimeter breath¡­ but it turned out to be a false alarm.
An animal.
Why are you telling me this?
You told us to keep you informed of every incident.
You were very clear.
Sir,the search index is complete.
Based on chemical shipments,spider has turned up three leading chemists in the Western European region.
We have one in Cadiz,Spain,another in Palermo,Italy,and the last one in Basel,Switzerland.
Basel is close to Colmar.
That's got to be the one.
The candidate is one Werner Christinger.
He is a Professor of chemistry at Basel institute of technology...
Specializes in neuropharmacology.
Looks like he's handled some black-market requests as well
Like the regimen.
I'm on my way.
I have a team in Germany.
They can be there in under an hour.
That's not how it works.
I find the guardian.I destroy the Box.
No,we're not going to destroy the Box,not immediately.
I'm sending a retrieval team.
That's not the deal.
New deal...
Employer's prerogative.
The chemist's a Werner Christinger from the Basel institute of technology.
But there's a Gogol team on its way.
On its way from where?
Germany,so it's close.
I'd never make it back on time.You've got to get there first.
I'm on it.
It's me.
You should know Nikita's closing in on the Black Box,and she's making me approach solo.
Bring Mr. Elliot with us.
His knowledge of the Box and the guardian may still prove to be useful.
Thank you,papa.
amsterdam
We have a destination...
Amsterdam.
BASEL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY
Amsterdam...
Acknowledged.
Do you have the Black Box?
- Aye.
- Good.Keep it secure.
In Amsterdam,you'll receive further instructions after you rendezvous with the other guardians.
I'm on my way.
Just about to pick up the last of my regimen.
Is my order ready?
Yes.
100 count of each,just as you'd asked.
Hands.
Hands!
Take the Black Box out.
Slowly put it on the table.
Slowly.
Step away.
You,grab the Box.
Bring it to me.
Sir,we have visuals.
Taking them out.
Gogol!

Les manettes,par l?
Ne bougez pas.
Yes?
Local authorities have custody of the target and the Box.
"Authorities"?
Who alerted them?
It seems the chemist was under observation for his illegal activities.
Once the shooting started,Dard units were called in.
Also they have Nikita.
She was with them.
They're being transported to Zurich.
Follow them.
Call in teams two and three for backup.
We'll be there shortly.
Nikita.
Well,now we know the answer to who you were calling...
Not that that's a surprise.
For such a highly trained operative,Mr. Elliot,you are absurdly transparent...
A single-celled organism.
It's no wonder Percy assigned you to...
Watch a Box.
Now,Nikita...
Is perhaps the most complex individual I have ever come across.
I honestly don't know what she sees in you.
We share a common interest.
We both can't wait to kill you.
Yuri,over here!
But if we give Americans what they want,they might help us in the future.
The Americans are being bullies,and bullies only respond to strength.
- Yes,but...
- Sergei,enough business,huh?
It's a beautiful day.
You are coming over for Easter,yes?
Katya is making a Kulichi.
I don't know.
What is it?
Not another woman.
No,not a woman.
But,uh,Easter is meant for families.
And,uh,you should be with yours.
You're right.
Easter is for families.
So...
Should I tell Katya you will arrive by noon?
You're truly blessed,Nikolai.
You have a fine house,a beautiful wife,a loving daughter.
Someday you'll have all that.
Until then,you are stuck with us.
How did you find me?
Did you intercept a call?
A communication tap?
Right.
You ran a good stack.
Hard cover was solid,but you were using a modified Weaver when you should have been...
What are you doing?
Tactical breakdown back at the lab.
We're not friends or partners.
No,but we're professionals.
We're nothing!
You're Division.
Was Division.
Right.
You're the rogue.
Why'd you leave?
Because I realized what Division really was.
Do you even know what it is that you're guarding...
What's on that Box?
I worked it out.
The Box?
It's important to Percy,which means it's leverage.
It's power.
I'm not stupid.
I know what Division is.
It's a giant criminal organization...
Granted,one that plays on a world stage but the principles are all the same as any local racket.
There will be a payout,a massive one in this case, for anyone who can keep their head low and know which player to get behind.
My bet's on Percy.
So,yes,I know what the Box is.
It's a golden ticket.
You chose the wrong side to back.
Percy's rotting in a hole in Jersey.He's finished.
What?
You really have no idea what's going on,do you?
Who's on the wrong side now?
Make sure the van is clean...
No loose ends.
Understood.
Mr. Elliot has outlived his usefulness.
Make sure he's...
Nonoperational.
I have the Box.
It's about time.
Bring it straight to the house...
- No stops.
- On my way.
There's three more!
Go!
- Thanks.
- Thanks for calling.
Nikita's in the van.
Guys...
He's gone.
So how's Max?
He's good.
He asked about you,actually.
Called you Tsiotsya s Pistaletam.
"The gun lady."
Yeah,well,at least you made an impression.
How's Birkhoff?
He's better.
He needs some time.
Yeah,well,he's tough.
He'll be annoying the hell out of you in no time.
And you?
How are you?
I'm...
Glad to see you.
We have to go.
The guardian's on the move.
He doesn't have the Box,and Ari's probably destroyed it by now.
No,Ari told me he wants to keep it.
They must think they can use it for something.
We got a bigger problem.
The police confiscated this laptop from the guardian.
I took it when we left the scene.
The guardians are on secondary protocol.
Wait.
What are you talking about?
All right,primary protocol is to stay put and guard the Box.
Secondary protocol is to pull stakes and report to a designated location and wait for further instructions.
Percy instituted it a few years back.
That's why he cleared out of the farmhouse.
Okay,who can initiate secondary protocol?
Only Percy.
That's impossible.He's locked up.
What location?
Where are they going?
I don't know.
It was to be given by verbal command, which is why we got to get going and start tracking the...the guardians.
They're gathering.
Percy's behind it.
We don't know if there's anything happening with Percy.
But what we do know is that Ari has the Box,and we need to get it back.
It's biometrically sealed.
They can't decrypt it without the guardian's blood,which is why the Box isn't an issue.
The Box is always an issue.
Okay,I'll go after the guardian.
You go after Ari,and you'll be fine with him.
- No,Michael goes with you.
- What?
- Wait.
Hold on a second.
- There are at least three guardians out there,okay?
You're gonna be outgunned.
It's gonna take the both of you.
Nikita,I just got here.
I can't leave you now.
This isn't about us.
- You have no way of finding Ari.
- Yeah,she does.
When Ari started threatening me,I figured...
I'd keep tabs.
I put a tracker on his car.
We'll have the time to deal with this all later.
You realize every law-enforcement agency in the region is on high alert, and you're chasing Ari Tasarov into the heart of Gogol territory?
You don't even know where he's headed.
Yes.
But it's the right thing to do.
You're right.
I don't know what I'm gonna find there.
Uncomfortable?
It's hard to go back.
It's not my first choice.
Mine either,but it was necessary.
However,punishment is only effective if there's an opportunity for rehabilitation.
I'm willing to restore some of your privileges if you tell me everything you told Alex...
Where she's getting her resources,who she's working with, how much she really knows about Semak.
Let's start again.
I told her she needs to think about her future.
And in order to do that,she needs to be completely clear-eyed about her past.
After all...
We can't know where we're going until we know from where we came.
It's not an easy journey.
It can be painful,arduous.
But if we have the courage to face the truth...
It could lead to the right path.
That's something we all seek.
You expect Alex to have some kind of revelation?
Clarity.
Our memories can be unreliable narrators.
You may think you know with absolute certainty what's in your past...
And then you find out you don't know the past at all.
Alexandra?
Mama?
Previously on Nikita...
We have to stop Division, and to do that, we need to find the Black Boxes.
They contain evidence of every job Division has ever done.
I help you get the Black Box, if you help me get the man who ordered my family's death and now has men hunting me.
Our arrangement concerns the Black Boxes.
We heard a rumor that Nikita has one.
Can you verify that?
She doesn't.
The guardian's not here.
I take it our target wasn't present.
He cleared out recently.
Hmm, near miss.
I don't get it.
All the signs were right...
Shadow bank account, movement patterns.
A guardian should have been here.
Perhaps he took a trip, a weekend getaway.
Guardians don't take trips.
They don't do anything but stay at their posts and guard their Black Boxes.
Well, you're the expert...
Not that we have anything to show for that.
You got something to say?
Just that our business arrangement hasn't been very good business, Mr. Elliot.
Gogol has given you time, money, resources, and what have you given us?
The limited pleasure of your company?
Look, I-I...
No more excuses, Mr. Elliot.
You will find and destroy the remaining Black Boxes.
I expect proof of real progress soon.
Until that time...
You may consider our business up for review.
Nikita!
What are you doing here?
- Gogol?
- Hold on.
- Ari Tasarov?
- It's not what you think.
Really?
'Cause what I think is that you are working with a Russian black-ops group whose top priority is killing me!
I know this looks bad, but Ari wants Percy dead just as much as we do.
I'm not working with Gogol, Nikita.
I'm using them.
Oh, where have I heard that before?
Nikita, I would never let them hurt you.
I made it very clear.
They even breathe in your direction,
I'm ripping their heads off, starting with Ari.
Now, really...
What are you doing here?
I need your help.
You do?
To get a Black Box.
- I lost mine.
- Lost it?
How?
Amanda.
What do you mean you can't find Alex?
According to internal surveillance records, she's been off campus for 84 hours.
She left her phone here, so there's no way to contact or trace her.
What about the N.R.O.'s search grid?
- Anything from their systems?
- No, nothing.
I'm sorry, but isn't Alex technically a free agent?
Shouldn't she be free to come and go as she likes?
Yes, of course.
But after Gogol tried to kill her, we all agreed the safest place for her was within these walls.
Something extraordinary must have happened to make her leave.
I need to make sure she's okay.
She accessed a series of satellite images focused just outside Moscow.
The Udinov mansion...
Her childhood home.
Why would she be looking at that?
Because currently, it's the residence of the man she intends to kill.
And knowing Alex, she's in Russia already.
Andrei Abramov?
I don't speak Russian.
But I understand you're used to dealing with an international clientele.
What are you looking to buy...
Shoes?
Purses?
I just got some Gucci.
Guns, ammo.
Now, I'm gonna need a Glock 26 with a 9-millimeter suppressor, 5 boxes of frangible rounds and 5 boxes of hollow points, and a knife with a black blade.
I know Gogol's supposed to be the enemy, but that's when we were with Division.
The sides aren't the same anymore.
Gogol is dangerous.
That could be good for us.
Nikita, we don't have a lot of friends left.
You think you're the first person who's tried to take advantage of them?
Percy tried it.
Even he got burned.
What do you mean Percy got burned?
What are you talking about?
Operation Pale Fire.
Division collaborated with Sergei Semak to kill Nikolai Udinov and his family.
Pale Fire?
It was the first time I ever defied my orders.
I saved the daughter, Alexandra.
Alexand...
Alex?
Your partner?
That's why she's working with you to take down Division.
Well, her focus has shifted.
She's headed somewhere dark, and I'm as much to blame for that as anyone.
Why doesn't she trust you anymore?
All right.
You take the bed.
I'll take the couch.
If we're gonna take down Gogol, we're gonna need our rest...
Or at least I will.
Ever since I got off the regimen,
I sleep all the time.
Human again, huh?
Oh, yeah.
It kind of sucks.
Oh, and just to be clear,
Gogol is not the priority anymore.
Black Box is.
You said you got near a guardian.
- What happened to him?
- I don't know.
But whatever he's up to can't be good.
Tofu scramble...
Tarragon's the key, a little bit of saffron.
I love it.
Owen, seriously...
This...
Is so yum.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
What does Michael make for you?
It's been a long time since someone's made breakfast for me.
Speaking of which, where is your scruffier half?
He's figuring some stuff out.
You want to call him?
I want you to tell me about this guardian.
His name is Patrick Miller, according to the records at the bank where he stashed his Box.
I used Gogol's computers to scan accounts using my search parameters.
I got to tell you, those Gogol techs...
They could give your little guy a run for his money.
Anyways, we got a hit.
By the time I got there, he had, uh, closed his accounts.
Raided his farmhouse, cleared out.
He leave anything behind?
Nothing.
Place was clean.
Well, we'll double-check.
You don't know that.
What?
Nothing.
I just...
I'd forgotten how bossy you can be, and, well, I kind of missed that.
Shut up.
Something still bugs me.
Guardians never leave their posts, not ever, unless they get a direct order from Percy.
Well, Percy's locked up in Division.
He can't be doing that, not in the position he's in now.
Take everything out.
All of it.

That's not the deal.
New deal...
Employer's prerogative.
The chemist's a Werner Christinger from the Basel institute of technology.
But there's a Gogol team on its way.
On its way from where?
Germany, so it's close.
I'd never make it back on time.
You've got to get there first.
I'm on it.
Hey, it's me.
You should know Nikita's closing in on the Black Box, and she's making me approach solo.
Aah!
Bring Mr. Elliot with us.
His knowledge of the Box and the guardian may still prove to be useful.
Thank you, papa.
We have a destination...
Amsterdam.
Amsterdam...
Acknowledged.
- Do you have the Black Box?
- Aye.
Good.
Keep it secure.
In Amsterdam, you'll receive further instructions after you rendezvous with the other guardians.
I'm on my way.
Just about to pick up the last of my regimen.
Is my order ready?
Yes. 100 count of each, just as you'd asked.
Hands.
Hands!
Take the Black Box out.
Slowly put it on the table.
Slowly.
Step away.
You, grab the Box.
Bring it to me.
Aah!
Sir, we have visuals.
Taking them out.
Gogol!
Jetez vos armes par terre.
Doucement.
Maintenant.
Le couteau aussi.
Vos armes par terre.
Et le couteau.
Laissez-les par là.
- Commandant.
- Montre avec les manettes.
Les manettes, par là.
Ne bougez pas.
Yes?
Local authorities have custody of the target and the Box.
"Authorities"?
Who alerted them?
It seems the chemist was under observation for his illegal activities.
Once the shooting started, Dard units were called in.
Also they have Nikita.
She was with them.
They're being transported to Zurich.
Follow them.
Call in teams two and three for backup.
We'll be there shortly.
Nikita.
Well, now we know the answer to who you were calling...
Not that that's a surprise.
For such a highly trained operative, Mr. Elliot, you are absurdly transparent...
A single-celled organism.
It's no wonder Percy assigned you to...
Watch a Box.
Now, Nikita...
Is perhaps the most complex individual
I have ever come across.
I honestly don't know what she sees in you.
We share a common interest.
We both can't wait to kill you.
Yuri, over here!
But if we give Americans what they want, they might help us in the future.
The Americans are being bullies, and bullies only respond to strength.
- Yes, but...
- Sergei, enough business, huh?
It's a beautiful day.
You are coming over for Easter, yes?
Katya is making a Kulichi.
- I don't know.
Uh...
- What is it?
Not another woman.
No, not a woman.
But, uh, Easter is meant for families.
And, uh, you should be with yours.
You're right.
Easter is for families.
So...
Should I tell Katya you will arrive by noon?
You're truly blessed, Nikolai.
You have a fine house, a beautiful wife, a loving daughter.
Someday you'll have all that.
Until then, you are stuck with us.
How did you find me?
Did you intercept a call?
A communication tap?
Right.
You ran a good stack.
Hard cover was solid, but you were using a modified Weaver
- when you should have been...
- What are you doing?
Tactical breakdown back at the lab.
We're not friends or partners.
No, but we're professionals.
We're nothing!
- You're Division.
- Was Division.
Right.
You're the rogue.
Why'd you leave?
Because I realized what Division really was.
Do you even know what it is that you're guarding...
What's on that Box?
I worked it out.
The Box?
It's important to Percy, which means it's leverage.
It's power.
I'm not stupid.
I know what Division is.
It's a giant criminal organization...
Granted, one that plays on a world stage but the principles are all the same as any local racket.
There will be a payout, a massive one in this case, for anyone who can keep their head low and know which player to get behind.
My bet's on Percy.
So, yes, I know what the Box is.
It's a golden ticket.
You chose the wrong side to back.
Percy's rotting in a hole in Jersey.
He's finished.
What?
You really have no idea what's going on, do you?
Who's on the wrong side now?
Make sure the van is clean...
No loose ends.
Understood.
Mr. Elliot has outlived his usefulness.
Make sure he's...
Nonoperational.
I have the Box.
It's about time.
Bring it straight to the house...
- No stops.
- On my way.
There's three more!
Go!
- Thanks.
- Thanks for calling.
Nikita's in the van.
Guys...
He's gone.
So how's Max?
He's good.
He asked about you, actually.
Called you Tsiotsya s Pistaletam.
"The gun lady."
Yeah, well, at least you made an impression.
Yeah.
How's Birkhoff?
He's better.
He needs some time.
Yeah, well, he's tough.
He'll be annoying the hell out of you in no time.
And you?
How are you?
I'm...
Glad to see you.
We have to go.
The guardian's on the move.
He doesn't have the Box, and Ari's probably destroyed it by now.
No, Ari told me he wants to keep it.
They must think they can use it for something.
We got a bigger problem.
The police confiscated this laptop from the guardian.
I took it when we left the scene.
The guardians are on secondary protocol.
Wait.
What are you talking about?
All right, primary protocol is to stay put and guard the Box.
Secondary protocol is to pull stakes and report to a designated location and wait for further instructions.
Percy instituted it a few years back.
That's why he cleared out of the farmhouse.
Okay, who can initiate secondary protocol?
Only Percy.
That's impossible.
He's locked up.
What location?
- Where are they going?
- I don't know.
It was to be given by verbal command, which is why we got to get going and start tracking the... the guardians.
They're gathering.
Percy's behind it.
We don't know if there's anything happening with Percy.
But what we do know is that Ari has the Box,
- and we need to get it back.
- It's biometrically sealed.
They can't decrypt it without the guardian's blood, which is why the Box isn't an issue.
The Box is always an issue.
Okay, I'll go after the guardian.
You go after Ari, and you'll be fine with him.
No, Michael goes with you.
- What?
- Wait.
Hold on a second.
There are at least three guardians out there, okay?
You're gonna be outgunned.
It's gonna take the both of you.
Nikita, I just got here.
I can't leave you now.
This isn't about us.
You have no way of finding Ari.
Yeah, she does.
When Ari started threatening me, I figured...
I'd keep tabs.
I put a tracker on his car.
We'll have the time to deal with this all later.
You realize every law-enforcement agency in the region is on high alert, and you're chasing Ari Tasarov into the heart of Gogol territory?
You don't even know where he's headed.
Yes.
But it's the right thing to do.
You're right.
I don't know what I'm gonna find there.
Uncomfortable?
It's hard to go back.
It's not my first choice.
Mine either, but it was necessary.
However, punishment is only effective if there's an opportunity for rehabilitation.
I'm willing to restore some of your privileges if you tell me everything you told Alex...
Where she's getting her resources, who she's working with, how much she really knows about Semak.
Let's start again.
I told her she needs to think about her future.
And in order to do that, she needs to be completely clear-eyed about her past.
After all...
We can't know where we're going until we know from where we came.
It's not an easy journey.
It can be painful, arduous.
But if we have the courage to face the truth...
It could lead to the right path.
That's something we all seek.
You expect Alex to have some kind of revelation?
Clarity.
Our memories can be unreliable narrators.
You may think you know with absolute certainty what's in your past...
And then you find out you don't know the past at all.
Alexandra?
Mama?
Previously on Nikita...
We have to stop Division, and to do that, we need to find the Black Boxes.
They contain evidence of every job Division has ever done.
I help you get the Black Box, if you help me get the man who ordered my family's death and now has men hunting me.
Our arrangement concerns the Black Boxes.
We heard a rumor that Nikita has one.
Can you verify that?
She doesn't.
[Man speaking Russian]
The guardian's not here.
I take it our target wasn't present.
He cleared out recently.
Hmm, near miss.
I don't get it.
All the signs were right...
Shadow bank account, movement patterns.
A guardian should have been here.
Perhaps he took a trip, a weekend getaway.
Guardians don't take trips.
They don't do anything but stay at their posts and guard their Black Boxes.
Well, you're the expert...
Not that we have anything to show for that.
You got something to say?
Just that our business arrangement hasn't been very good business, Mr. Elliot.
Gogol has given you time, money, resources, and what have you given us?
The limited pleasure of your company?
Look, I-I...
No more excuses, Mr. Elliot.
You will find and destroy the remaining Black Boxes.
I expect proof of real progress soon.
Until that time...
You may consider our business up for review.
[Light thud]
[Choking] Nikita!
What are you doing here?
- Gogol?
- Hold on.
- Ari Tasarov?
- It's not what you think.
Really?
'Cause what I think is that you are working with a Russian black-ops group whose top priority is killing me!
I know this looks bad, but Ari wants Percy dead just as much as we do.
I'm not working with Gogol, Nikita.
I'm using them.
Oh, where have I heard that before?
Nikita, I would never let them hurt you.
I made it very clear.
They even breathe in your direction,
I'm ripping their heads off, starting with Ari.
Now, really...
What are you doing here?
[Sighs]
I need your help.
You do?
[Sighs] To get a Black Box.
- I lost mine.
- Lost it?
How?
Amanda.
What do you mean you can't find Alex?
According to internal surveillance records, she's been off campus for 84 hours.
She left her phone here, so there's no way to contact or trace her.
What about the N.R.O.'s search grid?
- Anything from their systems?
- No, nothing.
I'm sorry, but isn't Alex technically a free agent?
Shouldn't she be free to come and go as she likes?
Yes, of course.
But after Gogol tried to kill her, we all agreed the safest place for her was within these walls.
Something extraordinary must have happened to make her leave.
I need to make sure she's okay.
[Computer beeps]
She accessed a series of satellite images focused just outside Moscow.
[Beeping]
The Udinov mansion...
Her childhood home.
Why would she be looking at that?
Because currently, it's the residence of the man she intends to kill.
And knowing Alex, she's in Russia already.
[Hip-hop music]
Andrei Abramov?
I don't speak Russian.
But I understand you're used to dealing with an international clientele.
[Chuckles] What are you looking to buy...
Shoes?
Purses?
I just got some Gucci.
Guns, ammo.
Now, I'm gonna need a Glock 26 with a 9-millimeter suppressor, 5 boxes of frangible rounds and 5 boxes of hollow points, and a knife with a black blade.
I know Gogol's supposed to be the enemy, but that's when we were with Division.
The sides aren't the same anymore.
Gogol is dangerous.
That could be good for us.
Nikita, we don't have a lot of friends left.
You think you're the first person who's tried to take advantage of them?
Percy tried it.
Even he got burned.
What do you mean Percy got burned?
What are you talking about?
Operation Pale Fire.
Division collaborated with Sergei Semak to kill Nikolai Udinov and his family.
Pale Fire?
It was the first time I ever defied my orders.
I saved the daughter, Alexandra.
Alexand...
Alex?
Your partner?
That's why she's working with you to take down Division.
Well, her focus has shifted.
She's headed somewhere dark, and I'm as much to blame for that as anyone.
Why doesn't she trust you anymore?
All right.
You take the bed.
I'll take the couch.
If we're gonna take down Gogol, we're gonna need our rest...
Or at least I will.
Ever since I got off the regimen,
I sleep all the time.
Human again, huh?
Oh, yeah.
It kind of sucks.
[Giggles]
Oh, and just to be clear,
Gogol is not the priority anymore.
Black Box is.
You said you got near a guardian.
- What happened to him?
- I don't know.
But whatever he's up to can't be good.
[Computer beeping]
[Keys clacking]
Tofu scramble...
Tarragon's the key, a little bit of saffron.
I love it.
Owen, seriously...
This...
Is so yum.
- Yeah?
- [Chuckles] Yeah.
Thanks.
What does Michael make for you?
It's been a long time since someone's made breakfast for me.
Speaking of which, where is your scruffier half?
He's figuring some stuff out.
You want to call him?
I want you to tell me about this guardian.
[Sighs] His name is Patrick Miller, according to the records at the bank where he stashed his Box.
I used Gogol's computers to scan accounts using my search parameters.
I got to tell you, those Gogol techs...
They could give your little guy a run for his money.
Anyways, we got a hit.
By the time I got there, he had, uh, closed his accounts.
Raided his farmhouse, cleared out.
He leave anything behind?
Nothing.
Place was clean.
Well, we'll double-check.
You don't know that.
What?
Nothing.
I just...
I'd forgotten how bossy you can be, and, well, I kind of missed that.
[Chuckling] Shut up.
Something still bugs me.
Guardians never leave their posts, not ever, unless they get a direct order from Percy.
Well, Percy's locked up in Division.
He can't be doing that, not in the position he's in now.
Take everything out.
All of it.
"Reversed garment," eight letters.
You know, I have to say,
I've never been a fan of word games.
I find they favor the literal-minded.
Human puzzles, on the other hand, intrigue me.
For instance, why would you tell Alex where to find Sergei Semak?
You knew that would motivate her to attempt an ill-advised mission of revenge.
At this point, isn't Semak's death something we all want?
Percy, my timetable is very specific.
Removing him before Alex is ready to take over Zetrov could do more harm than good, which is something you also know.
That is why you're being punished.
And I was so hoping to get the credenza to complete the set.
Alex could die in this attempt.
I have faith in Alex.
She's very resourceful.
Which brings me back to...
Why are you trying to kill Semak?
And don't give me that story about how you handed him Zetrov and he turned against you.
Hmm, just like old times, isn't it?
Turncoat.
"Reversed garment," eight letters.
What about Alexandra Udinov?
Have you found her yet?
No, but most of my resources have been assigned to finding the Black Boxes.
Which just means you are failing on two fronts.
Sir, after our assassination attempt, it's safe to assume that Alexandra has gone into hiding.
She's probably cowering in some Division cave, in no position to cause any sort of trouble.
[Birds chirping]
- And moss always grows on?
- The north side of the tree.
And the forest?
Pinsky forest covers half a million acres, 1,000 of which are the property of the Udinovs.
I know all this, papa.
Why are we doing this all again?
I need to have complete confidence in your abilities.
I know, because the only person
I can depend on is myself.
I promise, I won't trust anyone.
There is a difference between dependence and trust.
Depend on yourself, but there will come a time when you must trust others, and that is not bad.
You must keep people close to you, the way I have your mother and your Uncle Sergei.
I do not want you to live your life alone, Alexandra.
[Grunts]
I told you, I went through everything.
[Cabinet door creaks]
Regimen case...
It's empty.
I already checked it.
Owen, you said that Percy used to send you your supply of the regimen, right?
Yeah.
Then where's the guardian getting his drugs from?
Can't be Percy.
It's not like ordering cough syrup.
You can't just pick up regimen at the local drugstore.
You need a specialist...
A doctor or a chemist.
The notes I got from Dr. Mars' lab list the chemicals needed to make it.
That's good...
That gives us a shot at tracking anyone who's ordered shipments of them.
It's a complicated trace.
He'd have to cross-reference a database of supply outlets with a list of scientists...
Legit, black market.
Good thing you know someone who can do that.
Like you said, they could give Birkhoff a run for his money, right?
Are you talking about Gogol?
- That's right.
- Just so I'm clear, when I decide to use Gogol resources, I'm...
I'm stupid.
But when you decide to do the same thing,
I-it's a brilliant plan?
Hey, you're the one who made the deal with the devil.
I'm just trying to get us the biggest bang for our buck.
Okay, but you said it yourself...
Ari is dangerous.
W-what if he decides to use this info?
What if he decides to cut me out of the process?
Which is why you're not gonna let that happen, and you're gonna go in person.
- What about Birkhoff, huh?
- Birkhoff could run this, couldn't he?
Possibly, but not as quickly.
This is...
This data is Gogol's backyard.
It'll be at their fingertips.
And...
Birkhoff needs some time to himself
- to recover.
- "Recover"?
From what... gamer's thumb?
Amanda captured him, tortured him.
She, uh...
She crushed his hand.
You okay?
Fine.
No, really.
Are you okay?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Every time I feel like I've got a handle on one part of my life, another part of it slips away.
I finally get Michael, and I lose Alex.
We get the Black Box, and I lose Michael.
It's like...
Rounding up marbles on a glass table.
And if I lose focus for even one second, someone gets hurt...
Someone I love.
Birkhoff...
[Softly] Ryan.
Who am I gonna lose next...
You?
I'm so tired.
I don't want to hurt anyone...
Anymore.
What do you want?
I want to stop.
[Scoffs]
I don't think you can.
You have to help people.
You have to stand up for those people who can't fight for themselves, because, Nikita, it's the right thing to do.
Division...
They gave you a gift.
When they gave you the ability to kill, they also gave you the ability to protect.
You taught me that.
[Softly] I don't know if Michael's coming back.
I think...
I don't know if Michael's coming back.
You know, if... if he can't see what he left behind, well, maybe you shouldn't be together.
I believe Mr. Elliot can still help us.
He's an ex-guardian.
It's a very unique skill set.
And yet the Black Boxes are still out there threatening me.
I have a suggestion on that front.
When we find a Box, perhaps we should consider other options besides simply destroying it.
What do you mean?
The Boxes are a record of every illegal covert operation
Division has ever conducted.
The information is so damaging to the Americans that they can't wait to destroy them.
Now, at the very least, that suggests that...
Maybe we should have a look inside, see if there's anything there that can help us.
Too dangerous.
If the truth that I was behind Nikolai Udinov's death were to come out...
No.
No loose ends.
Well, then perhaps you'd like me to take care of that other loose end.
Take care with your tone, Ari.
You are treading on dangerous ground.
My apologies.
I meant no disrespect.
But we have many enemies, sir, and I believe that in the right hands, a Black Box would be a very powerful weapon against them.
It could be the key to ensuring Zetrov's future.
Except we don't have one!
[Door opens]
I know how to get you a Black Box.
Alexandra.
Come on, Alexandra.
Papa?
You are not alone.
[Beeping]
[Phone rings]
Sir, the search index is complete.
Based on chemical shipments, spider has turned up three leading chemists in the Western European region.
Uh, we have one in Cadiz, Spain, another in Palermo, Italy, and the last one in Basel, Switzerland.
Basel is close to Colmar.
That's got to be the one.
The candidate is one Werner Christinger.
He is a Professor of chemistry at Basel institute of technology...
Uh, specializes in neuropharmacology.
Looks like he's handled some black-market requests as well, like the regimen.
I'm on my way.
I have a team in Germany.
They can be there in under an hour.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's not how it works.
I find the guardian.
I destroy the Box.
No, we're not going to destroy the Box, not immediately.
I'm sending a retrieval team.
That's not the deal.
New deal...
Employer's prerogative.
The chemist's a Werner Christinger from the Basel institute of technology.
But there's a Gogol team on its way.
On its way from where?
Germany, so it's close.
I'd never make it back on time.
You've got to get there first.
I'm on it.
[Phone beeps]
[Exhales deeply]
[Phone beeping]
Hey, it's me.
You should know Nikita's closing in on the Black Box, and she's making me approach solo.
Aah!
Bring Mr. Elliot with us.
His knowledge of the Box and the guardian may still prove to be useful.
[Birds chirping]
[Exhales deeply]
Thank you, papa.
[Phone beeps]
We have a destination...
Amsterdam.

Vos armes par terre.
Et le couteau.
Laissez-les par là.
- Commandant.
- Montre avec les manettes.
Les manettes, par là.
Ne bougez pas.
Yes?
Local authorities have custody of the target and the Box.
"Authorities"?
Who alerted them?
It seems the chemist was under observation for his illegal activities.
Once the shooting started, Dard units were called in.
Also they have Nikita.
She was with them.
They're being transported to Zurich.
Follow them.
Call in teams two and three for backup.
We'll be there shortly.
[Phone beeps]
Nikita.
Well, now we know the answer to who you were calling...
Not that that's a surprise.
For such a highly trained operative, Mr. Elliot, you are absurdly transparent...
A single-celled organism.
It's no wonder Percy assigned you to...
Watch a Box.
Now, Nikita...
Is perhaps the most complex individual

I honestly don't know what she sees in you.
We share a common interest.

Yuri, over here!
But if we give Americans what they want, they might help us in the future.
The Americans are being bullies, and bullies only respond to strength.
- Yes, but...
- Sergei, enough business, huh?
It's a beautiful day.
You are coming over for Easter, yes?
Katya is making a Kulichi.
- I don't know.
Uh...
- What is it?

You're right.
Easter is for families.
So...

You're truly blessed, Nikolai.
You have a fine house, a beautiful wife, a loving daughter.
Someday you'll have all that.
Until then, you are stuck with us.
[Chuckles]
[Man speaking Russian over radio]
How did you find me?
Did you intercept a call?
A communication tap?
Right.
You ran a good stack.
Hard cover was solid, but you were using a modified Weaver
- when you should have been...
- What are you doing?
Tactical breakdown back at the lab.
We're not friends or partners.
No, but we're professionals.
We're nothing!
- You're Division.
- Was Division.
Right.
You're the rogue.
Why'd you leave?
Because I realized what Division really was.
Do you even know what it is that you're guarding...
What's on that Box?
I worked it out.
The Box?
It's important to Percy, which means it's leverage.
It's power.
I'm not stupid.
I know what Division is.
It's a giant criminal organization...
Granted, one that plays on a world stage but the principles are all the same as any local racket.
There will be a payout, a massive one in this case, for anyone who can keep their head low and know which player to get behind.
[Softly] My bet's on Percy.
[Normal voice] So, yes, I know what the Box is.
It's a golden ticket.
You chose the wrong side to back.
Percy's rotting in a hole in Jersey.
He's finished.
What?
You really have no idea what's going on, do you?
Who's on the wrong side now?
Make sure the van is clean...
No loose ends.
Understood.
[Speaking Russian]
Mr. Elliot has outlived his usefulness.
Make sure he's...
Nonoperational.
[Phone beeps] I have the Box.
It's about time.
Bring it straight to the house...
- No stops.
- On my way.
[Tires squeal]
[Tires screeching]
There's three more!
Go!
- Thanks.
- Thanks for calling.
Nikita's in the van.
Guys...
He's gone.
So how's Max?
He's good.
He asked about you, actually.
Called you Tsiotsya s Pistaletam.
"The gun lady."
Yeah, well, at least you made an impression.
[Chuckles] Yeah.
How's Birkhoff?
He's better.
He needs some time.
Yeah, well, he's tough.
He'll be annoying the hell out of you in no time.

They can't decrypt it without the guardian's blood, which is why the Box isn't an issue.
The Box is always an issue.
Okay, I'll go after the guardian.
You go after Ari, and you'll be fine with him.
No, Michael goes with you.
- What?
- Wait.
Hold on a second.
There are at least three guardians out there, okay?
You're gonna be outgunned.
It's gonna take the both of you.
Nikita, I just got here.
I can't leave you now.
This isn't about us.
You have no way of finding Ari.
Yeah, she does.
When Ari started threatening me, I figured...
I'd keep tabs.
I put a tracker on his car.
We'll have the time to deal with this all later.
You realize every law-enforcement agency in the region is on high alert, and you're chasing Ari Tasarov into the heart of Gogol territory?
You don't even know where he's headed.
Yes.
But it's the right thing to do.
You're right.
I don't know what I'm gonna find there.
Uncomfortable?
It's hard to go back.
It's not my first choice.
Mine either, but it was necessary.
However, punishment is only effective if there's an opportunity for rehabilitation.
I'm willing to restore some of your privileges if you tell me everything you told Alex...
Where she's getting her resources, who she's working with, how much she really knows about Semak.
Let's start again.
I told her she needs to think about her future.
And in order to do that, she needs to be completely clear-eyed about her past.
After all...
We can't know where we're going until we know from where we came.
It's not an easy journey.
It can be painful, arduous.
But if we have the courage to face the truth...
It could lead to the right path.
[Device beeping]
That's something we all seek.
You expect Alex to have some kind of revelation?
Clarity.
Our memories can be unreliable narrators.
You may think you know with absolute certainty what's in your past...
And then you find out you don't know the past at all.
Alexandra?
Mama?
Previously on Sanctuary...
True or false, Normandy 1944,
Allied invasion.
You were on French soil when it happened.
Carentan.
Carentan is a very bad place.
Why don't we just attack this weather device?
If we simply blow it up, the creature they're using to power it could do massive damage.
There's no way to really kill a fire elemental.
Is there a way that you can force it down?
I appreciate it, Ravi, thank you.
I need you to visit the Mumbai Sanctuary.
Ravi is the head of house.
Dr. Zimmerman,
Ms. Freelander, namaste.
Call me Ravi.
He pretty much saved my life, twice.
Will!
What happened?
Unbelievable!
- Did you say Carentan?
- In Normandy?
Yeah, I thought it might ring a bell.
It does indeed.
How many are missing?
Well, it's hard to say exactly.
There's a media blackout, and my usual sources are strangely silent.
You have the partial list there.
Yeah, uh, a local farmer...
And his livestock.
A couple of backpacking tourists, and a busload of senior citizens.
All disappeared without a trace within a ten-kilometer radius of Carentan.
And no word from any of the residents?
No response to phone calls or emails, not even from the local police, and did you see that sat-link I sent you?
Yeah, I'm calling it up now.
Censored?
By whom?
There's the rub.
And Ravi went in five days ago?
He was already in Paris wrapping up the Bipedal Conference, so I figured...
No, absolutely, you made the right call.
I discovered he was sending a video log back to his computer at the Mumbai Sanctuary.
I called up his last post.
Take a look at this.
I'm inside the first checkpoint now, and I think I'm getting closer to the perimeter of the disturbance.
According to my estimates, it's within...
I'm feeling a strange tingling sensation...
Since then, nothing.
All contact was instantly lost.
It was like he disappeared off the face of the planet.
Bastards!
That answers my question.
First the French government, now Interpol.
Complete stonewall.
I know the feeling.
- C.I.A.?
- Schtum.
MI-6?
Waiting for a call back.
I've got a bridge I want to sell you.
Precisely.
Are you getting the feeling that we've been kicked out of the treehouse here?
It's like all our reciprocal agreements have been rescinded overnight.
Which means whatever's happening in Carentan must be terrifying the hell out of them.
I've just come from the Regional Magistrate's office.
Like blood from a stone, and apparently the Sûreté now wants me to leave the country within 12 hours, which, of course, only makes me more determined to stay.
I'm inside the first checkpoint now, and I think I'm getting closer to the perimeter of the disturbance.
According to my estimates, it's within...
I'm feeling a strange tingling sensation...
Any abnormal you heard of discharge energy like that?
Several, but they leave radiation signatures in the atmosphere, and we don't have any spikes in that area.
Gulfstream's on standby.
You ready?
Almost.
This would go a lot faster with Hank's help, by the way, but apparently they don't have phones in sweat lodges.
That's the last time we give him the weekend off to commune with his inner wolf.
Okay, so we used the background landscape from Ravi's video...
And the towers the cell signal bounced off...
To geo-map his last location, nice.
Exactly.
Oh, we got a hit.
Looks like a couple miles from the town center.
Okay, so if Ravi did find a way in, that would be our access point.
Stay sharp.
...And have the Tac Team standing by, just in case.
They're ready and waiting at Plymouth Naval Base.
It's just a 30-minute hop across the channel, if need be.
Good.
I'm leaving now.
I'll meet you there.
Ah...
Do you think that's wise?
We're already down one Sanctuary head.
Until I know what we're dealing with...
I was the one who sent Ravi in there.
I'm responsible.
So with all due respect, Guv, I'll see you at De Gaulle.
Cheeky bugger.
So, 65 years later... look a little different without the barbed wire and swastikas?
Ever so slightly.
Heads up.
What's the situation here?
Industrial spill.
We're asking everybody to turn back.
But I believe one of my colleagues...
Sorry, ma'am, until clean-up is complete, the area is off-limits.
Oh, bumpy roads...
You're not going to get carsick again?
- She's been very, very sick.
- Oh, God...
Nicely done.
Arretez!
Who's in charge here?
I am.
Dr. Magnus...
Inside.
Just you.
You know who I am.
Let's just say your reputation precedes you.
Wish I could say the same about you.
I don't have a name, not as far as you're concerned.
Right, then.
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?
This hazmat dog-and-pony show is a joke.
If there was a real radiation risk, you and your boys would be suited up.
Atmospherics from the area came back clean as a whistle.
No large industries for over a hundred kilometers.
Oh, and, by the way, you've got at least two trucks outside full of surface-to-air missiles.
Starstreaks, if I'm not mistaken.
Now, I had no idea they could be used to clean up a toxic spill.
You know the only reason you're still alive is because of who you are?
And I'm not leaving until I get some answers.
Now, one of my colleagues...
Ravi Ganapathiraman?
Have you seen him?
Six days ago.
Like you, he was stopped at our first checkpoint, and he was ordered to turn back.
But he didn't.
Is he alive?
Take your people, leave.
Now.
You know who I am, therefore you know what I do.
Whatever's going on here, maybe I can help.
This is above your pay grade, Doctor.
Yeah, even you.
Well, whoever he is, he's clearly ex-military.
He's not French Army.
Yeah, generic uniforms, no markings on the vehicles.
Some sort of private international security force.
Yet he's clearly acting with the approval of the French government, and yet his mandate's being rigorously shielded by intelligence agencies worldwide.
Well, something very big and very bad is going on inside that town.
Something no government wants to take responsibility for.
And yet all governments want to cover up.
That field, those trees.
Pull over.
I wonder if it's still there.
A tunnel from the war.
It leads under the field, and if memory serves, should end beyond the base camp.
Looks like somebody used it recently.
It must be how Ravi bypassed perimeter security.
Well, how did he know about it?
Well, it's in my old logs.
It could've come up if he did a Carentan search.
Now, you two, until we know what we're dealing with,
I'm not willing to endanger the entire team.
Aw, come on.
I could argue there's strength in numbers.
I'm sure you could, but not this time.
I guess I'll go first.
Don't even think about following.
Check our coordinates.
Yeah.
Okay, GPS says we're now behind enemy lines.
The perimeter camp is back that way.
Shh!
Listen.
It's so quiet.
Exactly.
Not even any birds.
The town's that way, beyond the treeline.
What the hell just happened?
Do you hear it?
Yeah.
Hey.
Hello.
Anglais.
Newcomers.
You were right.
You from Carentan?
Oui.
Come with us.
The Last One will be very excited to meet you.
Check it out, the whole town's gone green.
It's not quite as I remember it.
I'm not sure what I expected, but it certainly wasn't this.
I don't understand.
Something's not right.
Here he is.
The Last One.
Helen, Will...
Ravi!
Even though it's only been six days for you,
I'm now 74 years old.
My mind says it's not possible, and yet...
I look at you.
Um, I'm sorry, Ravi.
my brain is still playing catch-up here.
You say that you arrived in Carentan six days ago?
In your time.
But in this village, 40 years has passed.
In "dome-time,"
or at least, that's what I call it.
It's a massive time dilation field, and you can't leave?
Anyone who tries to pass through the boundary and re-enter the normal time stream is killed instantly.
There's an intense dimensional recoil.
It's like being hit by a train.
So we're trapped inside an invisible time dome... in France.
Awkward, but it does explain a lot.
Oh, yeah, it makes complete sense.
Come with me.
There's someone I want you to meet.
Anna!
Newcomers.
Welcome.
Helen, Will, this is my wife, Anna.
This used to be an old Nazi bunker.
Fond memories.
Of course.
But as I was saying, the time stream first erupted just over three weeks ago your time.
The epicenter was in a cave off the cliffs.
That's when the disappearances started.
The French government thought they had a Bermuda Triangle on their hands, so at first they sent in scientists.
Who never returned.
Then they sent in the military, who also never returned, and then, no one.
Until you... the Last One.
The rest, as they say, is history.
Literally.
So all this equipment...
Was already here, or brought in since.
Previous experiments?
The result of over 100 years of research by top scientists in France and the military, trying to understand the time stream, trying to solve it, dissolve it, and yet...
Here we are.
God, I can't believe it.
What?
I destroyed a massive fire elemental back in 1944.
Drove it into the earth less than half a mile from here, and now this?
You don't think this is your fault?
Well, it can't be a coincidence.
I have to admit, the thought did occur to me, but I haven't been able to find a connection.
Anna told me we had newcomers.
Josie, Helen, Will.
Josie is the granddaughter of the first French scientist to enter Carentan.
An excellent assistant.
She's also a natural at mathematics.
I also make sure he does not forget to eat his lunch.
Of course.
Let's go, Anna hates it when I'm late.
So easy to lose track of time when there's three years of daylight.
So one day of our time is equal to six years inside Carentan.
Three years of daylight, followed by three years of night.
The Dark Time.
Your 12-hour cycle translated into our years.
We're cut off, remember, from the outside world, so we have to stockpile all our resources.
Food from the harvests.
Energy from the solar panels, but it is never enough.
The stores of energy are the first to go.
Then the food runs out.
The last few months...
Only the youngest and the strongest make it through to the sunrise.
How long until the next Dark Time?
Nine months, in dome time.
But out there...
Less than three hours.
What if they don't come back?
They will.
Yeah, but what if they don't?
Then we'll go in after them.
What if we don't come back?
Well, then at least we'll be in there.
This is pointless.
You heard Magnus.
Yeah, she said "Don't go in the tunnel."
Right.
But that doesn't mean we're supposed to sit around with our thumb...
What is your point?
My point is, we're learning nothing here.
Let's go.
Freeze!
Stay right there.
Aw, crap...
Your colleagues did a very stupid thing.
They may be lost forever.
Look, you know what's going on, so just tell us.
Maybe he doesn't know.
Maybe no one knows what's happening in Carentan.
Impound their vehicle, put them in the supply tent.
- Sir.
- Let's go.
Some of this handwriting is practically indecipherable.
A combination of poor penmanship and homemade inks.
French, German, English.
Was none of this research computerized?
At first, but then they realized how risky that was.
Hard drives weren't built to last 150 years.
I barely feel like I've made a dent at all.
You've only been at it a week.
Give yourself time.
Time...
Time dilation.
Adam Worth and the time nodes.
Yet this can't have been his doing.
He died months ago in Hollow Earth.
In all my years here,
I've explored every square inch of the boundary.
There's no device anywhere.
Welcome to my world.
Do you never feel like giving up?
Just quitting?
Every day.
What keeps you going?
You.
I wanted to see the look on your face when I cracked this mother.
Well, let's get to it, then, shall we?
You take these readings every week?
The dome is like a living thing.
We're taking its pulse.
Looking for a weakening in the energy.
Have you ever found any?
If it's so dangerous to penetrate the dome, yet you can't see it, how do you...
Careful, now, we are close.
Slowly.
Yeah, I-I feel it.
It's like my skin is tingling.
If we kept walking, it would intensify.
Let me show you.
Another three meters, and...
I saw it happen once.
A young man, just before Dark Time.
He started screaming and ran, and ran, and just... blew apart.
Hey...
Don't think about that.
There's gotta be another way out, right?
What?
It's just, I was born here.
This is the only world I have ever known.
There's a hell of a lot more world outside of Carentan.
You're gonna love it.
Thanks.
Nice bathrooms you got there.
Just keep moving.
You know, it was real sweet of you to wait for me.
Get inside.
Okay.
Of course I trust you.
It's just that there are only two functioning motherboards left.
I can't give any guarantees.
But it is a chance to communicate with the outside world.
And on a frequency we know will be monitored.
But previous transmissions have never been answered.
That's because of the time differential.
When a signal broadcast from inside the dome is received on the outside, it's incredibly condensed.
We're talking hundredths of a nanosecond.
It would barely register on the most sensitive equipment.
Which is why I'm stretching out this signal, slowing it down.
Even a simple message like, "We are alive.
Time dilation field."
will take up two weeks to transmit.
And we're going to need uninterrupted power.
I've dedicated one of the solar panels.
All set, then.
I know they've only been gone half an hour, but this whole set-up gives me the creeps.
Yeah, me too.
I've got your location now.
Also, there's a strong satellite transmission coming from the same area.
The command tent.
Can you eavesdrop?
Signal's scrambled.
No surprise.
One more thing.
Just before your call came in, I picked up something odd.
Specifically?
Short bursts of static, like screeching white noise.
Interference?
Yeah, could be.
I'll look into it.
Ravi's asking that the solar panels be re-routed back to the battery stores.
Uh-huh.
You know, it's been three weeks since our S.O.S. call.
Yes, I know.
If the outside hasn't responded by now...
I'm fully aware of the situation, thank you.
Is there something I can help you with?
Yeah, I could really use a computer, or a proper pen and paper!
God, even a bloody slide-rule!
I'm sorry, Will.
These energy readings from the boundary?
Over a century's worth.
Do you know that when this time dilation field first came into existence, it was the size of a city block?
And now it's over 12 kilometers in diameter.
And every few decades, the pressure builds, like before an earthquake.
And when it breaks apart, the dome grows.
We know this.
But what we didn't know was that it was happening exponentially.
The energy readings from the past 20 years are climbing steadily, beyond anything we've ever measured.
So the dome's getting ready for another growth spurt.
A massive one.
Define "massive."
Half the Eastern coast of France, and if it keeps growing at this rate, in 120 years, the time dilation field will blanket the entire Earth.
120 years for us, in here, but out there...
Three weeks before the planet is torn apart.
This is ridiculous.
Agreed.
I mean, I didn't even work on that time dilation node we salvaged from Worth's warehouse.
Right.
Neither did you, by the way.
Right again.
And yet here we are trying to recreate it using pieces of old laptops, and-and-and iPods, and...
What is that?
Thermostat from a toaster.
I'm sorry I asked.
Look...
We know the epicenter of the original eruption.
Now, all subsequent growth radiated from there.
If I can nullify the time dilation field at that spot...
It would burst this bubble and return Carentan to normal time?
Come on, it can't be that simple.
Well, unfortunately, you're right.
However, we are lucky in that we have decades of research at our disposal.
I sense a "but" coming.
We are missing a key element, an element found in Worth's time node.
Cerrelium.
Okay, so where do we find that?
Hollow Earth.
Perfect.
Or... from the time node that Henry dismantled.
At the Sanctuary?
Mm.
In case you've forgotten, we can't just reach out and touch someone.
You know, I've been thinking about that, and I may have a way.
You were right.
This is the ultimate slow-broadcast message.
It's no wonder the satellites couldn't pick up any movement in Carentan.
In real-world time, we're moving so fast, we're not even a blur.
We are invisible.
But this should get somebody's attention.
Look at him.
I remember the early days.
It wasn't easy.
Go, talk to him.
Evening.
May I sit down?
Sure, please.
So, how are you?
I'm okay.
You?
Every day a new bone creaks.
But it does get easier, you know.
I'm not sure I want it to.
When did you...
Give up?
I was going to say "surrender."
I can't recall a specific moment.
I guess it happened gradually, a day at a time.
Next thing I knew, one day had turned into decades.
And you don't miss the real world?
Of course I do, but I've got a family here now, a life.
...it's a massive time dilation field.
It was an extremely compressed radio signal.
From here?
From Carentan.
It's Magnus!
Number 37... 750 gauss.
Probably too much copper.
Yeah.
You know, I-I think I need another coil here.
Did I see one in the tool box?
Happy birthday.
I can't believe you remembered.
Neither can I.
Can I open it?
Yeah, but I-I don't want you to get too excited, okay?
It's nothing much.
It's beautiful.
See, I think I screwed up the clasp...
Oh, be quiet.
See, I knew it.
I love it.
I'm glad you like it.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have...
No, no, no, no...
It's just complicated.
Abby.
Complicated.
Not for me.
But, see, you're... and she's the past, and...
Dark Time is coming.
If we make it through the famine years till sunrise...
I want to have a baby.
Hey, Magnus.
How's everything?
Great.
Yeah.
I'll go get us some lunch.
Anything you want to tell me?
No.
About the magnetic readings?
Oh, that.
Uh, yeah.
None of the metals that we smelted together have nearly enough gauss as Cerrelium.
Damn.
Means we'll have to wait and hope that someone's seen the rock signal.
And what if they do?
I mean, that could take years in our time to get that node here, and even then, there's no guarantee that it's going to work.
No, there isn't.
Yeah.
Will...
No, look...
You're immortal, essentially, but not me.
I mean, has it ever occurred to you that we may not solve this problem in my lifetime?
Time dilation field?
Her message is irrefutable evidence they're still alive!
And they need help, so let's move!
Your colleagues took it upon themselves to break through the barrier.
Their fate is their own responsibility.
So what the hell are you and your boys doing here, then?
'Cause you're certainly not helping anyone trapped in Carentan.
- There is a plan.
- It's in motion.
Oh, yeah, right.
Hey, this satellite feed...
How long has this been here?
A few minutes ago.
It suddenly appeared.
That's an elemental symbol.
Not according to my science guys.
No element on Earth like that.
True.
That's the symbol for Cerrelium.
An element found... elsewhere.
All personnel.
Project Greenhouse is a go.
T-minus 37 minutes.
Mark.
This is a message from Magnus and Will.
What does it mean?
Uh, it's hard to explain, but give us time.
Time, you don't have.
The field is expanding.
My job is to stop it.
Project Greenhouse.
It's an air strike.
They're going to blow Carentan off the map.
Even if you put the time node pieces on a plane right now...
There's no way we're going to beat the air strike.
Does it have to be Cerrelium?
There must be something else we can substitute.
I don't know...
Okay, Biggie, remember last week when you were making that bouillabaisse, and you ran out of saffron, so you used turmeric instead, and it tasted just as good.
Did not.
You get my point.
All right, let's give it a shot.
What do you got in your kitchen over there?
Should be just up ahead.
By the way, Will, Happy New Year.
Somehow I don't feel like celebrating.
You see that sky?
Sunset's beginning.
45 days until nightfall.
The solar panels will go dead, we'll lose power to the lab.
Which is why we're testing this node now.
Here we are, the epicenter of the original disturbance.
You know, without the Cerrelium...
I agree, and if time weren't forcing my hand, I'd wait, but what choice do we have?
Say a prayer.
Turn it off!
Bloody hell!
Ravi?
Ravi!
Your experiment, my God.
What happened?
People disappeared.
What do you mean?
Everything went very fast, then slow, and then they were gone.
Just vanished?
I saw one of them with my own eyes.
André.
He was re-sheeting one of the solar panels.
He fell, but vanished before he hit the ground.
Magnus, what have we done?
Four people were vaporized because our experiment failed.
What if it didn't fail?
What if, for a few seconds, we managed to diffuse the time dilation field?
Well, then why did those people disappear?
Because when Carentan resets itself to real world time, they don't exist.
In your time, they haven't been born yet.
Okay, okay, so... if we get the Cerrelium, stabilize the node, make it work properly...
Then anything inside this dome that was created after its inception, equipment, animals, people, will cease to exist.
And the only people who will survive the reset...
The three of us.
Everybody else...
No!
No...
Josie...
Josie, wait!
Josie, wait!
Hey, stop!
Look at me!
We didn't know!
We didn't know.
We didn't know.
Well, now you do.
So are you going to continue your experiments, even though we would all just...
How could you just... disappear me?
Oh, beauty.
It's not going to be easy walking a surface-to-air missile past these guys.
We don't need the whole missile.
The alloy Biggie mentioned is the thruster stage.
It's part of the heat shield.
Uh, I don't suppose you have a screwdriver?
Penknife?
Yeah.
Here.
Oh, come to mama...
Okay.
You're going to need this.
Thanks.
Hold your fire!
What the hell was that all about?
It's not Cerrelium, but I was able to use parts of the missile they sent.
And how's it going?
As usual, slower than I'd like.
Hopefully this new shielding will do the trick.
One more stunt like that, and the next bullet goes in your head.
To hell with you!
There are people alive in there!
There's still a chance to save them!
Not in the next nine minutes.
The birds are already in the air.
Let's go.
I don't hate you.
If the dome continues to spread, continents shifting at lightning speed...
Oceans born in the blink of an eye...
The stress on the Earth's core will rip this planet apart.
I understand all that.
Like you, I'm a scientist, but I'm also a husband.
The sun has almost set.
Are you ready?
Can I really be doing this?
Please, dear, I can't talk about this anymore.
If our small sacrifice can save billions of people...
You were always the stronger one.
Whenever the children got sick, I would worry so much, but you...
We will never leave you, I promise.
If you don't see us here, look here.
That's where we will be.
Always.
Now, go, my love.
It's time for you to be the strong one.
The shielding is as secure as it'll ever be.
It's been a long time...
not a good time.
I just wish I knew how to say goodbye.
It's Ravi!
There's a crowd in the street.
I told them that you'd come out and speak with them.
They're watching the front of the Mayor's office.
All right, we'll go through the basement and out the back.
I don't know how long I can hold them.
Every second counts.
Thank you.
Just listen to us!
A time dilation field's a massive concentration of energy.
You hit that sucker with a bomb, and there is no telling what the fallout will be!
You still don't get it, do you?
The train has left the station.
Whatever happens, it's all going to be over in 60 seconds.
Magnus!
Will!
What is it?
- You've got to hurry.
- I couldn't hold them.
They have found out where you are.
There they are!
Stop!
Stop!
Josie...
Josie, don't do this.
Helen, get away from that machine.
Please.
Who the hell are you to say who lives and who dies?
Josie!
No!
We made it.
Ravi didn't.
Anyone else?
After the reset, we were found in the field.
Kate said something about a... an air strike that was called off at the last second, but I was still pretty groggy.
I could have dreamt that.
They had a million questions, but I told them to let you sleep.
Thank you.
But now we need to get to work.
Something, or someone, is behind what happened in Carentan.
I feel it in my gut.
You're not blaming yourself, are you?
Until I know differently.
Oh, that hurt, that hurt...
Previously on Sanctuary...
It's your fault, Normandy 1944,
Allied invasion.
You were on French soil when it happened.
[Machine gun fire]
[Zimmerman]:
Carentan?
[Jeanette]:
Carentan is a very bad place.
Why don't we just attack this weather device?
[Magnus]:
If we simply blow it up, the creature they're using to power it could do massive damage.
There's no way to really kill a fire elemental.
Is there a way that you can force down?
[Air whooshing]
I appreciate it, Ravi, thank you.
I need you to visit the Mumbai Sanctuary.
Ravi is the head of house.
Dr. Zimmerman,
Ms. Freelander, namaste.
Call me Ravi.
[Will]:
He pretty much saved my life, twice.
Will!
What happened?
Unbelievable!
[Magnus]:
Did you say Carentan?
In Normandy?
Yeah, I thought it might ring a bell.
It does indeed.
How many are missing?
Well, it's hard to say exactly.
There's a media blackout, and my usual sources are strangely silent.
You have the partial list there.
Yeah, uh, a local farmer...
And his livestock.
A couple of backpacking tourists, and a busload of senior citizens.
All disappeared without a trace within a ten-kilometer radius of Carentan.
And no word from any of the residents?
No response to phone calls or emails, not even from the local police, and did you see that sat-link I sent you?
Yeah, I'm calling it up now.
Censored?
By whom?
There's the rub.
And Ravi went in five days ago?
He was already in Paris wrapping up the Bipedal Conference, so I figured--
No, absolutely, you made the right call.
I discovered he was sending a video log back to his computer at the Mumbai Sanctuary.
I called up his last post.
Take a look at this.
[Ravi]:
I'm inside the first checkpoint now, and I think I'm getting closer to the perimeter of the disturbance.
According to my estimates, it's within...
I'm feeling a strange tingling sensation--
[Declan]:
Since then, nothing.
All contact was instantly lost.
It was like he disappeared off the face of the planet.

== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Bastards!
That answers my question.
The French government, now Interpol.
Complete stonewall.
I know the feeling.
C.I.A.?
Schtum .
MI-6?
Waiting for a call back.
I've got a bridge I want to sell you.
Precisely.
Are you getting the feeling we've been kicked out of the treehouse here?
It's like all our reciprocal agreements have been rescinded overnight.
Which means whatever's happening in Carentan must be terrifying the hell out of them.
[Sighs]
I've just come from the regional Magistrate's office.
Like blood from a stone, and apparently the Surete now wants me to leave the country within 12 hours, which, of course, only makes me more determined to stay.
I'm inside the first checkpoint now, and I think I'm getting closer to the perimeter of the disturbance.
According to my estimates, it's within...
I'm feeling a strange tingling sensation--
Any abnormal you heard of discharge energy like that?
Several, but they leave radiation signatures in the atmosphere, and we don't have any spikes in that area.
Gulfstream's on standby.
You ready?
Almost.
This would go a lot faster with Hank's help, by the way, but apparently they don't have phones in sweat lodges.
That's the last time we give him the weekend off to commune with his inner wolf.
[Chuckling]
Okay, so we used the background landscape from Ravi's video...
And the towers the cell signal bounced off...
To geo-map his last location, nice.
Exactly.
Oh, we got a hit.
Looks like a couple miles from the town center.
Okay, so if Ravi did find a way in, that would be our access point.
Stay sharp.
...And have the TAC team standing by, just in case.
They're ready and waiting at Plymouth Naval Base.
It's just a 30-minute hop across the channel, if need be.
Good.
I'm leaving now.
I'll meet you there.
Ah...
Do you think that's wise?
We're already down one Sanctuary head.
Until I know what we're dealing with--
I was the one who sent Ravi in there.
I'm responsible.
So with all due respect, Guv, I'll see you at De Gaulle.
[Phone link beeps off]
Cheeky bugger.
So, 65 years later...
Look a little different without the barbed wire and swastikas?
Ever so slightly.
Heads up.
What's the situation here?
Industrial spill.
We're asking everybody to turn back.
But I believe one of my colleagues--
Sorry, ma'am, until clean-up is complete, the area is off-limits.
[Kate groans]
Oh, bumpy roads...
You're not going to get carsick again?
She's been very, very sick.
Oh, God...
She's been really sick.
[Retching]
[Blows thud]
Nicely done.
Arretez!
Who's in charge here?
I am.
Dr. Magnus...
Inside.
Just you.
You know who I am.
Let's just say your reputation precedes you.
Wish I could say the same about you.
I don't have a name, not as far as you're concerned.
Right, then.
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?
This Hazmat dog-and-pony show is a joke.
If there was a real radiation risk, you and your boys would be suited up.
Atmospherics from the area came back clean as a whistle.
No large industries for over a hundred kilometers.
Oh, and, by the way, you've got at least two trucks outside full of surface-to-air missiles.
Starstreaks , if I'm not mistaken.
Now, I had no idea they could be used to clean up a toxic spill.
You know the only reason you're still alive is because of who you are?
And I'm not leaving until I get some answers.
Now, one of my colleagues--
Ravi Ganapathiraman?
Have you seen him?
Six days ago.
Like you, he was stopped at our first checkpoint, and he was ordered to turn back.
But he didn't.
Is he alive?
Take your people, leave.
Now.
You know who I am, therefore you know what I do.
Whatever's going on here, maybe I can help.
This is above your pay grade, doctor.
Yeah, even you.
Well, whoever he is, he's clearly ex-military.
He's not French army.
Yeah, generic uniforms, no markings on the vehicles.
Some sort of private international security force.
Yet he's clearly acting with the approval of the French government, and yet his mandate's being rigorously shielded by intelligence agencies worldwide.
Well, something very big and very bad is going on inside that town.
Something no government wants to take responsibility for.
And yet all governments want to cover up.
That field, those trees.
Pull over.
I wonder if it's still there.
A tunnel from the war.
It leads under the field, and if memory serves, should end beyond the base camp.
Looks like somebody used it recently.
It must be how Ravi bypassed perimeter security.
Well, how did he know about it?
Well, it's in my old logs.
It could've come up if he did a Carentan search.
Now, you two, until we know what we're dealing with,
I'm not willing to endanger the entire team.
Aw, come on.
I could argue there's strength in numbers.
I'm sure you could, but not this time.
I guess I'll go first.
Don't even think about following.
[Grunting with effort]
Check our coordinates.
Yeah.
Okay, GPS says we're now behind enemy lines.
The perimeter camp is back that way.
Shh!
Listen.
It's so quiet.
Exactly.
Not even any birds.
The town's that way, beyond the treeline.
[Sizzling hum]
What the hell just happened?
[Forest alive with bird and insect song]
Do you hear it?
Yeah.
Hey.
Hello.
Anglais.
[In French accent]:
Newcomers.
You were right.
You from Carentan?
Oui.
Come with us.
The last one will be very excited to meet you.
[Woman giggles merrily]
[Crowd murmuring excitedly in French and English]
Check it out, the whole town's gone green.
It's not quite as I remember it.
I'm not sure what I expected, but it certainly wasn't this.
I don't understand.
Something's not right.
Here he is.
The last one.
Helen, Will...
Ravi!
Helen, even though it's only been six days for you,
I'm now 74 years old.
My mind says it's not possible, and yet...
I look at you.
Um, I'm sorry, Ravi.
My brain is still playing catch-up here.
You say that you arrived in Carentan six days ago?
In your time.
But in this village, 40 years has passed.
In "dome-time,"
or at least, that's what I call it.
It's a massive time dilation field, and you can't leave?
Anyone who tries to pass through the boundary and re-enter the normal time stream is killed instantly.
There's an intense dimensional recoil.
It's like being hit by a train.
So we're trapped inside an invisible time dome...
In France.
Awkward, but it does explain a lot.
Oh, yeah, it makes complete sense.
Come with me.
There's someone I want you to meet.
Anna!
Newcomers.
Welcome.
Helen, Will, this is my wife, Anna.
This used to be an old Nazi bunker.
Fond memories.
Of course.
But as I was saying, the time stream first erupted just over three weeks ago your time.
The epicenter was in a cave off the cliffs.
That's when the disappearances started.
The French government thought they had a Bermuda Triangle on their hands, so at first they sent in scientists.
Who never returned.
Then they sent in the military, who also never returned, and then, no one.
Until you...
The last one.
The rest, as they say, is history.
Literally.
So all this equipment...
Was already here, or brought in since.
Previous experiments?
The result of over 100 years of research by top scientists in France and the military, trying to understand the time stream, trying to solve it, dissolve it, and yet...
Here we are.
God, I can't believe it.
What?
I destroyed a massive fire elemental back in 1944.
Drove it into the Earth less than half a mile from here, and now this?
You don't think this is your fault?
Well, it can't be a coincidence.
I have to admit, the thought did occur to me, but I haven't been able to find a connection.
Anna told me we had newcomers.
Josie, Helen, Will.
Josie is the granddaughter of the first French scientist to enter Carentan.
An excellent assistant.
She's also a natural at mathematics.
I also make sure he does not forget to eat his lunch.
[Ravi laughs]
Of course.
Let's go, Anna hates it when I'm late.
So easy to lose track of time when there's three years of daylight.
So one day of our time is equal to six years inside Carentan.
Three years of daylight, followed by three years of night.
The dark time.
Your 12-hour cycle translated into our years.
We're cut off, remember, from the outside world, so we have to stockpile all our resources.
Food from the harvests.
Energy from the solar panels, but it is never enough.
The stores of energy are the first to go.
Then the food runs out.
The last few months...
Only the youngest and the strongest make it through to the sunrise.
How long until the next dark time?
Nine months, in dome time.
But out there...
Less than three hours.
What if they don't come back?
They will.
Yeah, but what if they don't?
Then we'll go in after them.
What if we don't come back?
Well, then at least we'll be in there.
[Groans in frustration]
This is pointless.
You heard Magnus.
Yeah, she said "don't go in the tunnel."
Right.
But that doesn't mean we're supposed to sit around with our thumb up--
What is your point?
My point is, we're learning nothing here.
Let's go.
Freeze!
Stay right there.
Aw, crap...
Your colleagues did a very stupid thing.
They may be lost forever.
Look, you know what's going on, so just tell us.
Maybe he doesn't know.
Maybe no one knows what's happening in Carentan.
Impound their vehicle, put them in the supply tent.
Sir.
Let's go.
Some of this handwriting is practically indecipherable.
A combination of poor penmanship and homemade inks.
French, German, English.
Was none of this research computerized?
At first, but then they realized how risky that was.
Hard drives weren't built to last 150 years.
[Sighs heavily]
I barely feel like I've made a dent at all.
You've only been at it a week.
Give yourself time.
Time...
Time dilation.
Adam Worth and the time nodes.
Yet this can't have been his doing.
He died months ago in Hollow Earth.
In all my years here,
I've explored every square inch of the boundary.
There's no device anywhere.
Do you never feel like giving up?
Just quitting?
Every day.
What keeps you going?
You.
I wanted to see the look on your face when I cracked this mother.
[Laughs]
Well, let's get to it, then, shall we?
[Device clicking]
You take these readings every week?
The dome's like a living thing.
We're taking its pulse.
Looking for a weakening in the energy.
Have you ever found any?
If it's so dangerous to penetrate the dome, yet you can't see it, how do you...
Careful, now, we are close.
Slowly.
[Chuckles in wonder]
Yeah, I-I feel it.
It's like my skin is tingling.
If we kept walking, it would intensify.
Let me show you.
Another three meters, and...
I saw it happen once.
A young man, just before dark time.
He started screaming and ran, and ran, and just...
Blew apart.
Hey...
Don't think about that.
There's gotta be another way out, right?
What?
It's just, I was born here.
This is the only world I have ever known.
There's a hell of a lot more world outside of Carentan.
You're gonna love it.
Thanks.
Nice bathrooms you got there.
Just keep moving.
You know, it was real sweet of you to wait for me.
Get inside.
Okay.
Of course I trust you.
It's just that there are only two functioning motherboards left.
I can't give any guarantees.
But it is a chance to communicate with the outside world.
And on a frequency we know will be monitored.
But previous transmissions have never been answered.
That's because of the time differential.
When a signal broadcast from inside the dome is received on the outside, it's incredibly condensed.
We're talking hundredths of a nanosecond.
It would barely register on the most sensitive equipment.
Which is why I'm stretching out this signal, slowing it down.
Even a simple message like, "we are alive.
Time dilation field."
Will take up two weeks to transmit.
And we're going to need uninterrupted power.
I've dedicated one of the solar panels.
All set, then.
[Frequency wavering]
I know they've only been gone half an hour, but this whole set-up gives me the creeps.
Yeah, me too.
I've got your location now.
Also, there's a strong satellite transmission coming from the same area.
The command tent.
Can you eavesdrop?
Signal's scrambled.
No surprise.
One more thing.
Just before your call came in, I picked up something odd.
Specifically?
Short bursts of static, like screeching white noise.
Interference?
Yeah, could be.
I'll look into it.
[Pounding calculator buttons]
Ravi's asking that the solar panels be re-routed back to the battery stores.
Uh-huh.
You know, it's been three weeks since our S.O.S. call.
Yes, I know.
If the outside hasn't responded by now--
I'm fully aware of the situation, thank you.
Is there something I can help you with?
Yeah, I could really use a computer, or a proper pen and paper!
God, even a bloody slide-rule!
I'm sorry, Will.
These energy readings from the boundary?
Over a century's worth.
Do you know that when this time dilation field first came into existence, it was the size of a city block?
And now it's over 12 kilometers in diameter.
And every few decades, the pressure builds, like before an earthquake.
And when it breaks apart, the dome grows.
We know this.
But what we didn't know was that it was happening exponentially.
The energy readings from the past 20 years are climbing steadily, beyond anything we've ever measured.
So the dome's getting ready for another growth spurt.
A massive one.
Define "massive."
Half the eastern coast of France, and if it keeps growing at this rate, in 120 years, the time dilation field will blanket the entire Earth.
120 years for us...
In here, but out there-- three weeks before the planet is torn apart.
This is ridiculous.
Agreed.
I mean, I didn't even work on that time dilation node we salvaged from Worth's warehouse.
Right.
Neither did you, by the way.
Right again.
And yet here we are trying to recreate it using pieces of old laptops, and-and-and iPods, and...
What is that?
Thermostat from a toaster.
[Scoffs] I'm sorry I asked.
[Sighs heavily]
Look...
We know the epicenter of the original eruption.
Now, all subsequent growth radiated from there.
If I can nullify the time dilation field at that spot-- it would burst this bubble and return Carentan to normal time?
Come on, it can't be that simple.
Well, unfortunately, you're right.
However, we are lucky in that we have decades of research at our disposal.
I sense a "but" coming.
We are missing a key element, an element found in Worth's time node.
Cerrelium.
Okay, so where do we find that?
Hollow Earth.
[Laughs wryly] Perfect.
Or...
From the time node that Henry dismantled.
At the Sanctuary?
Mm.
In case you've forgotten, we can't just reach out and touch someone.
You know, I've been thinking about that, and I may have a way.
You were right.
This is the ultimate slow-broadcast message.
It's no wonder the satellites couldn't pick up any movement in Carentan.
In real-world time, we're moving so fast, we're not even a blur.
We are invisible.
But this should get somebody's attention.
Look at him.
I remember the early days.
It wasn't easy.
Go, talk to him.
Evening.
May I sit down?
Sure, please.
So, how are you?
I'm okay.
You?
Every day a new bone creaks.
But it does get easier, you know.
I'm not sure I want it to.
When did you...
Give up?
I was going to say "surrender."
[Chuckles]
I can't recall a specific moment.
I guess it happened gradually, a day at a time.
Next thing I knew, one day had turned into decades.
And you don't miss the real world?
Of course I do, but I've got a family here now, a life.
[Kate]:
So it wasn't just interference?
It was an extremely compressed radio signal.
From here?
From Carentan.
It's Magnus!
Number 37... 750 gauss.
Probably too much copper.
Yeah.
You know, I-I think I need another coil here.
Did I see one in the tool box?
Happy Birthday.
I can't believe you remembered.
Neither can I.
Can I open it?
Yeah, but I-I don't want you to get too excited, okay?
It's nothing much.
It's beautiful.
See, I think I screwed up the clasp--
Oh, be quiet.
See, I knew it.
I love it.
I'm glad you like it.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have--
No, no, no, no...
It's just complicated.
Abby.
Complicated.
Not for me.
But, see, you're...
And she's the past, and...
Dark time is coming.
If we make it through the famine years till sunrise...
I want to have a baby.
Hey, Magnus.
How's everything?
Great.
Yeah.
I'll go get us some lunch.
Anything you want to tell me?
No.
About the magnetic readings?
Oh, that.
Uh, yeah.
[Clears throat awkwardly]
None of the metals that we smelted together have nearly enough gauss as cerrelium.
Damn.
Means we'll have to wait and hope that someone's seen the rock signal.
And what if they do?
I mean, that could take years in our time to get that node here, and even then, there's no guarantee that it's going to work.
No, there isn't.
Yeah.
Will--
No, look...
You're immortal, essentially, but I'm not.
I mean, has it ever occurred to you that we may not solve this problem in my lifetime?
Time dilation field?
Her message is irrefutable evidence they're still alive!
And they need help, so let's move!
Your colleagues took it upon themselves to break through the barrier.
Their fate is their own responsibility.
So, what the hell are you and your boys doing here, then?
'Cause you're certainly not helping anyone trapped in Carentan.
There is a plan.
It's in motion.
Oh, yeah, right.
Hey, this satellite feed...
How long has this been here?
A few minutes ago.
It suddenly appeared.
That's an elemental symbol.
Not according to my science guys.
No element on earth like that.
True.
It's the symbol for cerrelium.
An element found...
Elsewhere.
All personnel.
Project Greenhouse is a go.
T-minus 37 minutes.
Mark.
This is a message from Magnus and Will.
What does it mean?
Uh, it's hard to explain, but give us time.
Time, you don't have.
The field is expanding.
My job is to stop it.
Project Greenhouse.
It's an air strike.
They're going to blow Carentan off the map.
there's no way we're going to beat the air strike.
Does it have to be cerrelium?
There must be something else we can substitute.
I don't know...
Okay, Biggie, remember last week when you were making that bouillabaisse, and you ran out of saffron, so you used turmeric instead, and it tasted just as good.
Did not.
You get my point.
All right, let's give it a shot.
What do you got in your kitchen over there?
Should be just up ahead.
By the way, Will,
Happy New Year.
Somehow I don't feel like celebrating.
You see that sky?
Sunset's beginning.
45 days until nightfall.
The solar panels will go dead, we'll lose power to the lab.
Which is why we're testing this node now.
Here we are, the epicenter of the original disturbance.
You know, without the cerrelium...
I agree, and if time weren't forcing my hand, I'd wait, but what choice do we have?
Say a prayer.
[Device whirring]
[Humming grows loud, wind starts to blow]
[Voice phasing and echoing] Turn it off!
Bloody hell!
[Crowd murmuring in concern]
Ravi?
Ravi!
Your experiment, my God.
What happened?
People disappeared.
What do you mean?
Everything went very fast, then slow, and then they were gone.
Just vanished?
I saw one of them with my own eyes.
Andre.
He was re-sheeting one of the solar panels.
He fell, but vanished before he hit the ground.
Magnus, what have we done?
Four people were vaporized because our experiment failed.
What if it didn't fail?
What if, for a few seconds, we managed to diffuse the time dilation field?
Well, then why did those people disappear?
Because when Carentan resets itself to real world time, they don't exist.
In your time, they haven't been born yet.
Okay, okay, so...
If we get the cerrelium, stabilize the node, make it work properly...
Then anything inside this dome that was created after its inception, equipment, animals, people, will cease to exist.
And the only people who'll survive the reset...
The three of us.
Everybody else...
[Josie]:
No!
No...
Josie...
Josie, wait!
Josie, wait!
Hey, stop!
Look at me!
We didn't know!
We didn't know.
We didn't know.
But now you do.
So are you going to continue your experiments, even though we would all just...
How could you just...
Disappear me?
Oh, beauty.
[Declan]:
It's not going to be easy walking a surface-to-air missile past these guys.
We don't need the whole missile.
The alloy Biggie mentioned is the thruster stage.
It's part of the heat shield.
Uh, I don't suppose you have a screwdriver?
Penknife?
Yeah.
Here.
Oh, come to mama...
Okay.
You're going to need this.
Thanks.
[Starts engine]
Hold your fire!
What the hell was that all about?
It's not cerrelium, but I was able to use parts of the missile they sent.
How's it going?
As usual, slower than I'd like.
Hopefully this new shielding will do the trick.
One more stunt like that, and the next bullet goes in your head.
To hell with you!
There are people alive in there!
There's still a chance to save them!
Not in the next nine minutes.
The birds are already in the air.
Let's go.
I don't hate you.
If the dome continues to spread, continents shifting at lightning speed...
Oceans born in the blink of an eye...
The stress on the Earth's core will rip this planet apart.
I understand all that.
Like you, I'm a scientist, but I'm also a husband.
The sun has almost set.
Are you ready?
Can I really be doing this?
Please, dear,
I can't talk about this anymore.
If our small sacrifice can save billions of people...
You were always the stronger one.
Whenever the children got sick,
I would worry so much, but you-- we will never leave you, I promise.
If you don't see us here, look here.
That's where we will be.
Always.
Now, go, my love.
It's time for you to be the strong one.
The shielding is as secure as it'll ever be.
It's been a long time, not a good time.
I just wish I knew how to say goodbye.
[Banging on door]
It's Ravi!
There's a crowd in the street.
I told them that you'd come out and speak with them.
They're watching the front of the mayor's office.
All right, we'll go through the basement and out the back.
I don't know how long I can hold them.
Every second counts.
Thank you.
[Crowd shouting angrily outside]
Just listen to us!
The time dilation field's a massive concentration of energy.
You hit that sucker with a bomb, and there is no telling what the fallout will be!
You still don't get it, do you?
The train has left the station.
Whatever happens, it's all going to be over in 60 seconds.
Magnus!
Will!
What is it?
You've got to hurry.
I couldn't hold them.
They have found out where you are.
Stop!
Stop!
Josie...
Josie, don't do this.
Helen, get away from that machine.
Please.
Who the hell are you to say who lives and who dies?
[Device hums to life]
Josie!
No!
[Gun fires]
[Sounds slow dreamily]
[Thud]
[Medical monitors beep steadily]
[Announcements in French sound over P.A. system]
We made it.
Ravi didn't.
Anyone else?
[Groans groggily]
After the reset, we were found in the field.
Kate said something about a...
An air strike that was called off at the last second, but I was still pretty groggy.
I could have dreamt that.
They had a million questions, but I told them to let you sleep.
Thank you...
But now we need to get to work.
Something, or someone, is behind what happened in Carentan.
I feel it in my gut.
You're not blaming yourself, are you?
Until I know differently.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Previously on Sanctuary...
It's your fault, Normandy 1944,
Allied invasion.
You were on French soil when it happened.
[Machine gun fire]
[Zimmerman]:
Carentan?
[Jeanette]:
Carentan is a very bad place.
Why don't we just attack this weather device?
[Magnus]:
If we simply blow it up, the creature they're using to power it could do massive damage.
There's no way to really kill a fire elemental.
Is there a way that you can force down?
[Air whooshing]
I appreciate it, Ravi, thank you.
I need you to visit the Mumbai Sanctuary.
Ravi is the head of house.
Dr. Zimmerman,
Ms. Freelander, namaste.
Call me Ravi.
[Will]:
He pretty much saved my life, twice.
Will!
What happened?
Unbelievable!
[Magnus]:
Did you say Carentan?
In Normandy?
Yeah, I thought it might ring a bell.
It does indeed.
How many are missing?
Well, it's hard to say exactly.
There's a media blackout, and my usual sources are strangely silent.
You have the partial list there.
Yeah, uh, a local farmer...
And his livestock.
A couple of backpacking tourists, and a busload of senior citizens.
All disappeared without a trace within a ten-kilometer radius of Carentan.
And no word from any of the residents?
No response to phone calls or emails, not even from the local police, and did you see that sat-link I sent you?
Yeah, I'm calling it up now.
Censored?
By whom?
There's the rub.
And Ravi went in five days ago?
He was already in Paris wrapping up the Bipedal Conference, so I figured--
No, absolutely, you made the right call.
I discovered he was sending a video log back to his computer at the Mumbai Sanctuary.
I called up his last post.
Take a look at this.
[Ravi]:
I'm inside the first checkpoint now, and I think I'm getting closer to the perimeter of the disturbance.
According to my estimates, it's within...
I'm feeling a strange tingling sensation--
[Declan]:
Since then, nothing.
All contact was instantly lost.
It was like he disappeared off the face of the planet.
♪ Sanctuary 3x18 ♪ Carentan Original Air Date on June 6, 2011
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Bastards!
That answers my question.
The French government, now Interpol.
Complete stonewall.
I know the feeling.
C.I.A.?
Schtum .
MI-6?
Waiting for a call back.
I've got a bridge I want to sell you.
Precisely.
Are you getting the feeling we've been kicked out of the treehouse here?
It's like all our reciprocal agreements have been rescinded overnight.
Which means whatever's happening in Carentan must be terrifying the hell out of them.
[Sighs]
I've just come from the regional Magistrate's office.
Like blood from a stone, and apparently the Surete now wants me to leave the country within 12 hours, which, of course, only makes me more determined to stay.
I'm inside the first checkpoint now, and I think I'm getting closer to the perimeter of the disturbance.
According to my estimates, it's within...
I'm feeling a strange tingling sensation--
Any abnormal you heard of discharge energy like that?
Several, but they leave radiation signatures in the atmosphere, and we don't have any spikes in that area.
Gulfstream's on standby.
You ready?
Almost.
This would go a lot faster with Hank's help, by the way, but apparently they don't have phones in sweat lodges.
That's the last time we give him the weekend off to commune with his inner wolf.
[Chuckling]
Okay, so we used the background landscape from Ravi's video...
And the towers the cell signal bounced off...
To geo-map his last location, nice.
Exactly.
Oh, we got a hit.
Looks like a couple miles from the town center.
Okay, so if Ravi did find a way in, that would be our access point.
Stay sharp.
...And have the TAC team standing by, just in case.
They're ready and waiting at Plymouth Naval Base.
It's just a 30-minute hop across the channel, if need be.
Good.
I'm leaving now.
I'll meet you there.
Ah...
Do you think that's wise?
We're already down one Sanctuary head.
Until I know what we're dealing with--
I was the one who sent Ravi in there.
I'm responsible.
So with all due respect, Guv, I'll see you at De Gaulle.
[Phone link beeps off]
Cheeky bugger.
So, 65 years later...
Look a little different without the barbed wire and swastikas?
Ever so slightly.
Heads up.
What's the situation here?
Industrial spill.
We're asking everybody to turn back.
But I believe one of my colleagues--
Sorry, ma'am, until clean-up is complete, the area is off-limits.
[Kate groans]
Oh, bumpy roads...
You're not going to get carsick again?
She's been very, very sick.
Oh, God...
She's been really sick.
[Retching]
[Blows thud]
Nicely done.
Arretez!
Who's in charge here?
I am.
Dr. Magnus...
Inside.
Just you.
You know who I am.
Let's just say your reputation precedes you.
Wish I could say the same about you.
I don't have a name, not as far as you're concerned.
Right, then.
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?
This Hazmat dog-and-pony show is a joke.
If there was a real radiation risk, you and your boys would be suited up.
Atmospherics from the area came back clean as a whistle.
No large industries for over a hundred kilometers.
Oh, and, by the way, you've got at least two trucks outside full of surface-to-air missiles.
Starstreaks , if I'm not mistaken.
Now, I had no idea they could be used to clean up a toxic spill.
You know the only reason you're still alive is because of who you are?
And I'm not leaving until I get some answers.
Now, one of my colleagues--
Ravi Ganapathiraman?
Have you seen him?
Six days ago.
Like you, he was stopped at our first checkpoint, and he was ordered to turn back.
But he didn't.
Is he alive?
Take your people, leave.
Now.
You know who I am, therefore you know what I do.
Whatever's going on here, maybe I can help.
This is above your pay grade, doctor.
Yeah, even you.
Well, whoever he is, he's clearly ex-military.
He's not French army.
Yeah, generic uniforms, no markings on the vehicles.
Some sort of private international security force.
Yet he's clearly acting with the approval of the French government, and yet his mandate's being rigorously shielded by intelligence agencies worldwide.
Well, something very big and very bad is going on inside that town.
Something no government wants to take responsibility for.
And yet all governments want to cover up.
That field, those trees.
Pull over.
I wonder if it's still there.
A tunnel from the war.
It leads under the field, and if memory serves, should end beyond the base camp.
Looks like somebody used it recently.
It must be how Ravi bypassed perimeter security.
Well, how did he know about it?
Well, it's in my old logs.
It could've come up if he did a Carentan search.
Now, you two, until we know what we're dealing with,
I'm not willing to endanger the entire team.
Aw, come on.
I could argue there's strength in numbers.
I'm sure you could, but not this time.
I guess I'll go first.
Don't even think about following.
[Grunting with effort]
Check our coordinates.
Yeah.
Okay, GPS says we're now behind enemy lines.
The perimeter camp is back that way.
Shh!
Listen.
It's so quiet.
Exactly.
Not even any birds.
The town's that way, beyond the treeline.
[Sizzling hum]
What the hell just happened?
[Forest alive with bird and insect song]
Do you hear it?
Yeah.
Hey.
Hello.
Anglais.
[In French accent]:
Newcomers.
You were right.
You from Carentan?
Oui.
Come with us.
The last one will be very excited to meet you.
[Woman giggles merrily]
[Crowd murmuring excitedly in French and English]
Check it out, the whole town's gone green.
It's not quite as I remember it.
I'm not sure what I expected, but it certainly wasn't this.
I don't understand.
Something's not right.
Here he is.
The last one.
Helen, Will...
Ravi!
Helen, even though it's only been six days for you,
I'm now 74 years old.
My mind says it's not possible, and yet...
I look at you.
Um, I'm sorry, Ravi.
My brain is still playing catch-up here.
You say that you arrived in Carentan six days ago?
In your time.
But in this village, 40 years has passed.
In "dome-time,"
or at least, that's what I call it.
It's a massive time dilation field, and you can't leave?
Anyone who tries to pass through the boundary and re-enter the normal time stream is killed instantly.
There's an intense dimensional recoil.
It's like being hit by a train.
So we're trapped inside an invisible time dome...
In France.
Awkward, but it does explain a lot.
Oh, yeah, it makes complete sense.
Come with me.
There's someone I want you to meet.
Anna!
Newcomers.
Welcome.
Helen, Will, this is my wife, Anna.
This used to be an old Nazi bunker.
Fond memories.
Of course.
But as I was saying, the time stream first erupted just over three weeks ago your time.
The epicenter was in a cave off the cliffs.
That's when the disappearances started.
The French government thought they had a Bermuda Triangle on their hands, so at first they sent in scientists.
Who never returned.
Then they sent in the military, who also never returned, and then, no one.
Until you...
The last one.
The rest, as they say, is history.
Literally.
So all this equipment...
Was already here, or brought in since.
Previous experiments?
The result of over 100 years of research by top scientists in France and the military, trying to understand the time stream, trying to solve it, dissolve it, and yet...
Here we are.
God, I can't believe it.
What?
I destroyed a massive fire elemental back in 1944.
Drove it into the Earth less than half a mile from here, and now this?
You don't think this is your fault?
Well, it can't be a coincidence.
I have to admit, the thought did occur to me, but I haven't been able to find a connection.
Anna told me we had newcomers.
Josie, Helen, Will.
Josie is the granddaughter of the first French scientist to enter Carentan.
An excellent assistant.
She's also a natural at mathematics.
I also make sure he does not forget to eat his lunch.
[Ravi laughs]
Of course.
Let's go, Anna hates it when I'm late.
So easy to lose track of time when there's three years of daylight.
So one day of our time is equal to six years inside Carentan.
Three years of daylight, followed by three years of night.
The dark time.
Your 12-hour cycle translated into our years.
We're cut off, remember, from the outside world, so we have to stockpile all our resources.
Food from the harvests.
Energy from the solar panels, but it is never enough.
The stores of energy are the first to go.
Then the food runs out.
The last few months...
Only the youngest and the strongest make it through to the sunrise.
How long until the next dark time?
Nine months, in dome time.
But out there...
Less than three hours.
What if they don't come back?
They will.
Yeah, but what if they don't?
Then we'll go in after them.
What if we don't come back?
Well, then at least we'll be in there.
[Groans in frustration]
This is pointless.
You heard Magnus.
Yeah, she said "don't go in the tunnel."
Right.
But that doesn't mean we're supposed to sit around with our thumb up--
What is your point?
My point is, we're learning nothing here.
Let's go.
Freeze!
Stay right there.
Aw, crap...
Your colleagues did a very stupid thing.
They may be lost forever.
Look, you know what's going on, so just tell us.
Maybe he doesn't know.
Maybe no one knows what's happening in Carentan.
Impound their vehicle, put them in the supply tent.
Sir.
Let's go.
Some of this handwriting is practically indecipherable.
A combination of poor penmanship and homemade inks.
French, German, English.
Was none of this research computerized?
At first, but then they realized how risky that was.
Hard drives weren't built to last 150 years.
[Sighs heavily]
I barely feel like I've made a dent at all.
You've only been at it a week.
Give yourself time.
Time...
Time dilation.
Adam Worth and the time nodes.
Yet this can't have been his doing.
He died months ago in Hollow Earth.
In all my years here,
I've explored every square inch of the boundary.
There's no device anywhere.
Do you never feel like giving up?
Just quitting?
Every day.
What keeps you going?
You.
I wanted to see the look on your face when I cracked this mother.
[Laughs]
Well, let's get to it, then, shall we?
[Device clicking]
You take these readings every week?
The dome's like a living thing.
We're taking its pulse.
Looking for a weakening in the energy.
Have you ever found any?
If it's so dangerous to penetrate the dome, yet you can't see it, how do you...
Careful, now, we are close.
Slowly.
[Chuckles in wonder]
Yeah, I-I feel it.
It's like my skin is tingling.
If we kept walking, it would intensify.
Let me show you.
Another three meters, and...
I saw it happen once.
A young man, just before dark time.
He started screaming and ran, and ran, and just...
Blew apart.
Hey...
Don't think about that.
There's gotta be another way out, right?
What?
It's just, I was born here.
This is the only world I have ever known.
There's a hell of a lot more world outside of Carentan.
You're gonna love it.
Thanks.
Nice bathrooms you got there.
Just keep moving.
You know, it was real sweet of you to wait for me.
Get inside.
Okay.
Of course I trust you.
It's just that there are only two functioning motherboards left.
I can't give any guarantees.
But it is a chance to communicate with the outside world.
And on a frequency we know will be monitored.
But previous transmissions have never been answered.
That's because of the time differential.
When a signal broadcast from inside the dome is received on the outside, it's incredibly condensed.
We're talking hundredths of a nanosecond.
It would barely register on the most sensitive equipment.
Which is why I'm stretching out this signal, slowing it down.
Even a simple message like, "we are alive.
Time dilation field."
Will take up two weeks to transmit.
And we're going to need uninterrupted power.
I've dedicated one of the solar panels.
All set, then.
[Frequency wavering]
I know they've only been gone half an hour, but this whole set-up gives me the creeps.
Yeah, me too.
I've got your location now.
Also, there's a strong satellite transmission coming from the same area.
The command tent.
Can you eavesdrop?
Signal's scrambled.
No surprise.
One more thing.
Just before your call came in, I picked up something odd.
Specifically?
Short bursts of static, like screeching white noise.
Interference?
Yeah, could be.
I'll look into it.
[Pounding calculator buttons]
Ravi's asking that the solar panels be re-routed back to the battery stores.
Uh-huh.
You know, it's been three weeks since our S.O.S. call.
Yes, I know.
If the outside hasn't responded by now--
I'm fully aware of the situation, thank you.
Is there something I can help you with?
Yeah, I could really use a computer, or a proper pen and paper!
God, even a bloody slide-rule!
I'm sorry, Will.
These energy readings from the boundary?
Over a century's worth.
Do you know that when this time dilation field first came into existence, it was the size of a city block?
And now it's over 12 kilometers in diameter.
And every few decades, the pressure builds, like before an earthquake.
And when it breaks apart, the dome grows.
We know this.
But what we didn't know was that it was happening exponentially.
The energy readings from the past 20 years are climbing steadily, beyond anything we've ever measured.
So the dome's getting ready for another growth spurt.
A massive one.
Define "massive."
Half the eastern coast of France, and if it keeps growing at this rate, in 120 years, the time dilation field will blanket the entire Earth.
120 years for us...
In here, but out there-- three weeks before the planet is torn apart.
This is ridiculous.
Agreed.
I mean, I didn't even work on that time dilation node we salvaged from Worth's warehouse.
Right.
Neither did you, by the way.
Right again.
And yet here we are trying to recreate it using pieces of old laptops, and-and-and iPods, and...
What is that?
Thermostat from a toaster.
[Scoffs] I'm sorry I asked.
[Sighs heavily]
Look...
We know the epicenter of the original eruption.
Now, all subsequent growth radiated from there.
If I can nullify the time dilation field at that spot-- it would burst this bubble and return Carentan to normal time?
Come on, it can't be that simple.
Well, unfortunately, you're right.
However, we are lucky in that we have decades of research at our disposal.
I sense a "but" coming.
We are missing a key element, an element found in Worth's time node.
Cerrelium.
Okay, so where do we find that?
Hollow Earth.
[Laughs wryly] Perfect.
Or...
From the time node that Henry dismantled.
At the Sanctuary?
Mm.
In case you've forgotten, we can't just reach out and touch someone.
You know, I've been thinking about that, and I may have a way.
You were right.
This is the ultimate slow-broadcast message.
It's no wonder the satellites couldn't pick up any movement in Carentan.
In real-world time, we're moving so fast, we're not even a blur.
We are invisible.
But this should get somebody's attention.
Look at him.
I remember the early days.
It wasn't easy.
Go, talk to him.
Evening.
May I sit down?
Sure, please.
So, how are you?
I'm okay.
You?
Every day a new bone creaks.
But it does get easier, you know.
I'm not sure I want it to.
When did you...
Give up?
I was going to say "surrender."
[Chuckles]
I can't recall a specific moment.
I guess it happened gradually, a day at a time.
Next thing I knew, one day had turned into decades.
And you don't miss the real world?
Of course I do, but I've got a family here now, a life.
[Kate]:
So it wasn't just interference?
It was an extremely compressed radio signal.
From here?
From Carentan.
It's Magnus!
Number 37... 750 gauss.
Probably too much copper.
Yeah.
You know, I-I think I need another coil here.
Did I see one in the tool box?
Happy Birthday.
I can't believe you remembered.
Neither can I.
Can I open it?
Yeah, but I-I don't want you to get too excited, okay?
It's nothing much.
It's beautiful.
See, I think I screwed up the clasp--
Oh, be quiet.
See, I knew it.
I love it.
I'm glad you like it.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have--
No, no, no, no...
It's just complicated.
Abby.
Complicated.
Not for me.
But, see, you're...
And she's the past, and...
Dark time is coming.
If we make it through the famine years till sunrise...
I want to have a baby.
Hey, Magnus.
How's everything?
Great.
Yeah.
I'll go get us some lunch.
Anything you want to tell me?
No.
About the magnetic readings?
Oh, that.
Uh, yeah.
[Clears throat awkwardly]
None of the metals that we smelted together have nearly enough gauss as cerrelium.
Damn.
Means we'll have to wait and hope that someone's seen the rock signal.
And what if they do?
I mean, that could take years in our time to get that node here, and even then, there's no guarantee that it's going to work.
No, there isn't.
Yeah.
Will--
No, look...
You're immortal, essentially, but I'm not.
I mean, has it ever occurred to you that we may not solve this problem in my lifetime?
Time dilation field?
Her message is irrefutable evidence they're still alive!
And they need help, so let's move!
Your colleagues took it upon themselves to break through the barrier.
Their fate is their own responsibility.
So, what the hell are you and your boys doing here, then?
'Cause you're certainly not helping anyone trapped in Carentan.
There is a plan.
It's in motion.
Oh, yeah, right.
Hey, this satellite feed...
How long has this been here?
A few minutes ago.
It suddenly appeared.
That's an elemental symbol.
Not according to my science guys.
No element on earth like that.
True.
It's the symbol for cerrelium.
An element found...
Elsewhere.
All personnel.
Project Greenhouse is a go.
T-minus 37 minutes.
Mark.
This is a message from Magnus and Will.
What does it mean?
Uh, it's hard to explain, but give us time.
Time, you don't have.
The field is expanding.
My job is to stop it.
Project Greenhouse.
It's an air strike.
They're going to blow Carentan off the map.
there's no way we're going to beat the air strike.
Does it have to be cerrelium?
There must be something else we can substitute.
I don't know...
Okay, Biggie, remember last week when you were making that bouillabaisse, and you ran out of saffron, so you used turmeric instead, and it tasted just as good.
Did not.
You get my point.
All right, let's give it a shot.
What do you got in your kitchen over there?
Should be just up ahead.
By the way, Will,
Happy New Year.
Somehow I don't feel like celebrating.
You see that sky?
Sunset's beginning.
45 days until nightfall.
The solar panels will go dead, we'll lose power to the lab.
Which is why we're testing this node now.
Here we are, the epicenter of the original disturbance.
You know, without the cerrelium...
I agree, and if time weren't forcing my hand, I'd wait, but what choice do we have?
Say a prayer.
[Device whirring]
[Humming grows loud, wind starts to blow]
[Voice phasing and echoing] Turn it off!
Bloody hell!
[Crowd murmuring in concern]
Ravi?
Ravi!
Your experiment, my God.
What happened?
People disappeared.
What do you mean?
Everything went very fast, then slow, and then they were gone.
Just vanished?
I saw one of them with my own eyes.
Andre.
He was re-sheeting one of the solar panels.
He fell, but vanished before he hit the ground.
Magnus, what have we done?
Four people were vaporized because our experiment failed.
What if it didn't fail?
What if, for a few seconds, we managed to diffuse the time dilation field?
Well, then why did those people disappear?
Because when Carentan resets itself to real world time, they don't exist.
In your time, they haven't been born yet.
Okay, okay, so...
If we get the cerrelium, stabilize the node, make it work properly...
Then anything inside this dome that was created after its inception, equipment, animals, people, will cease to exist.
And the only people who'll survive the reset...
The three of us.
Everybody else...
[Josie]:
No!
No...
Josie...
Josie, wait!
Josie, wait!
Hey, stop!
Look at me!
We didn't know!
We didn't know.
We didn't know.
But now you do.
So are you going to continue your experiments, even though we would all just...
How could you just...
Disappear me?
Oh, beauty.
[Declan]:
It's not going to be easy walking a surface-to-air missile past these guys.
We don't need the whole missile.
The alloy Biggie mentioned is the thruster stage.
It's part of the heat shield.
Uh, I don't suppose you have a screwdriver?
Penknife?
Yeah.
Here.
Oh, come to mama...
Okay.
You're going to need this.
Thanks.
[Starts engine]
Hold your fire!
What the hell was that all about?
It's not cerrelium, but I was able to use parts of the missile they sent.
How's it going?
As usual, slower than I'd like.
Hopefully this new shielding will do the trick.
One more stunt like that, and the next bullet goes in your head.
To hell with you!
There are people alive in there!
There's still a chance to save them!
Not in the next nine minutes.
The birds are already in the air.
Let's go.
I don't hate you.
If the dome continues to spread, continents shifting at lightning speed...
Oceans born in the blink of an eye...
The stress on the Earth's core will rip this planet apart.
I understand all that.
Like you, I'm a scientist, but I'm also a husband.
The sun has almost set.
Are you ready?
Can I really be doing this?
Please, dear,
I can't talk about this anymore.
If our small sacrifice can save billions of people...
You were always the stronger one.
Whenever the children got sick,
I would worry so much, but you-- we will never leave you, I promise.
If you don't see us here, look here.
That's where we will be.
Always.
Now, go, my love.
It's time for you to be the strong one.
The shielding is as secure as it'll ever be.
It's been a long time, not a good time.
I just wish I knew how to say goodbye.
[Banging on door]
It's Ravi!
There's a crowd in the street.
I told them that you'd come out and speak with them.
They're watching the front of the mayor's office.
All right, we'll go through the basement and out the back.
I don't know how long I can hold them.
Every second counts.
Thank you.
[Crowd shouting angrily outside]
Just listen to us!
The time dilation field's a massive concentration of energy.
You hit that sucker with a bomb, and there is no telling what the fallout will be!
You still don't get it, do you?
The train has left the station.
Whatever happens, it's all going to be over in 60 seconds.
Magnus!
Will!
What is it?
You've got to hurry.
I couldn't hold them.
They have found out where you are.
Stop!
Stop!
Josie...
Josie, don't do this.
Helen, get away from that machine.
Please.
Who the hell are you to say who lives and who dies?
[Device hums to life]
Josie!
No!
[Gun fires]
[Sounds slow dreamily]
[Thud]
[Medical monitors beep steadily]
[Announcements in French sound over P.A. system]
We made it.
Ravi didn't.
Anyone else?
[Groans groggily]
After the reset, we were found in the field.
Kate said something about a...
An air strike that was called off at the last second, but I was still pretty groggy.
I could have dreamt that.
They had a million questions, but I told them to let you sleep.
Thank you...
But now we need to get to work.
Something, or someone, is behind what happened in Carentan.
I feel it in my gut.
You're not blaming yourself, are you?
Until I know differently.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Previously on Sanctuary...
It's your fault, Normandy 1944,
Allied invasion.
You were on French soil when it happened.
Carentan?
Carentan is a very bad place.
Why don't we just attack this weather device?
If we simply blow it up, the creature they're using to power it could do massive damage.
There's no way to really kill a fire elemental.
Is there a way that you can force down?
I appreciate it, Ravi, thank you.
I need you to visit the Mumbai Sanctuary.
Ravi is the head of house.
Dr. Zimmerman,
Ms. Freelander, namaste.
Call me Ravi.
He pretty much saved my life, twice.
Will!
What happened?
Unbelievable!
Did you say Carentan?
In Normandy?
Yeah, I thought it might ring a bell.
It does indeed.
How many are missing?
Well, it's hard to say exactly.
There's a media blackout, and my usual sources are strangely silent.
You have the partial list there.
Yeah, uh, a local farmer...
And his livestock.
A couple of backpacking tourists, and a busload of senior citizens.
All disappeared without a trace within a ten-kilometer radius of Carentan.
And no word from any of the residents?
No response to phone calls or emails, not even from the local police, and did you see that sat-link I sent you?
Yeah, I'm calling it up now.
Censored?
By whom?
There's the rub.
And Ravi went in five days ago?
He was already in Paris wrapping up the Bipedal Conference, so I figured--
No, absolutely, you made the right call.
I discovered he was sending a video log back to his computer at the Mumbai Sanctuary.
I called up his last post.
Take a look at this.
I'm inside the first checkpoint now, and I think I'm getting closer to the perimeter of the disturbance.
According to my estimates, it's within...
I'm feeling a strange tingling sensation--
Since then, nothing.
All contact was instantly lost.
It was like he disappeared off the face of the planet.

Bastards!
That answers my question.
The French government, now Interpol.
Complete stonewall.
I know the feeling.
C.I.A.?
Schtum .
MI-6?
Waiting for a call back.
I've got a bridge I want to sell you.
Precisely.
Are you getting the feeling we've been kicked out of the treehouse here?
It's like all our reciprocal agreements have been rescinded overnight.
Which means whatever's happening in Carentan must be terrifying the hell out of them.
I've just come from the regional Magistrate's office.
Like blood from a stone, and apparently the Surete now wants me to leave the country within 12 hours, which, of course, only makes me more determined to stay.
I'm inside the first checkpoint now, and I think I'm getting closer to the perimeter of the disturbance.
According to my estimates, it's within...
I'm feeling a strange tingling sensation--
Any abnormal you heard of discharge energy like that?
Several, but they leave radiation signatures in the atmosphere, and we don't have any spikes in that area.
Gulfstream's on standby.
You ready?
Almost.
This would go a lot faster with Hank's help, by the way, but apparently they don't have phones in sweat lodges.
That's the last time we give him the weekend off to commune with his inner wolf.
Okay, so we used the background landscape from Ravi's video...
And the towers the cell signal bounced off...
To geo-map his last location, nice.
Exactly.
Oh, we got a hit.
Looks like a couple miles from the town center.
Okay, so if Ravi did find a way in, that would be our access point.
Stay sharp.
...And have the TAC team standing by, just in case.
They're ready and waiting at Plymouth Naval Base.
It's just a 30-minute hop across the channel, if need be.
Good.
I'm leaving now.
I'll meet you there.
Ah...
Do you think that's wise?
We're already down one Sanctuary head.
Until I know what we're dealing with--
I was the one who sent Ravi in there.
I'm responsible.
So with all due respect, Guv, I'll see you at De Gaulle.
Cheeky bugger.
So, 65 years later...
Look a little different without the barbed wire and swastikas?
Ever so slightly.
Heads up.
What's the situation here?
Industrial spill.
We're asking everybody to turn back.
But I believe one of my colleagues--
Sorry, ma'am, until clean-up is complete, the area is off-limits.
Oh, bumpy roads...
You're not going to get carsick again?
She's been very, very sick.
Oh, God...
She's been really sick.
Nicely done.
Arretez!
Who's in charge here?
I am.
Dr. Magnus...
Inside.
Just you.
You know who I am.
Let's just say your reputation precedes you.
Wish I could say the same about you.
I don't have a name, not as far as you're concerned.
Right, then.
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?
This Hazmat dog-and-pony show is a joke.
If there was a real radiation risk, you and your boys would be suited up.
Atmospherics from the area came back clean as a whistle.
No large industries for over a hundred kilometers.
Oh, and, by the way, you've got at least two trucks outside full of surface-to-air missiles.
Starstreaks , if I'm not mistaken.
Now, I had no idea they could be used to clean up a toxic spill.
You know the only reason you're still alive is because of who you are?
And I'm not leaving until I get some answers.
Now, one of my colleagues--
Ravi Ganapathiraman?
Have you seen him?
Six days ago.
Like you, he was stopped at our first checkpoint, and he was ordered to turn back.
But he didn't.
Is he alive?
Take your people, leave.
Now.
You know who I am, therefore you know what I do.
Whatever's going on here, maybe I can help.
This is above your pay grade, doctor.
Yeah, even you.
Well, whoever he is, he's clearly ex-military.
He's not French army.
Yeah, generic uniforms, no markings on the vehicles.
Some sort of private international security force.
Yet he's clearly acting with the approval of the French government, and yet his mandate's being rigorously shielded by intelligence agencies worldwide.
Well, something very big and very bad is going on inside that town.
Something no government wants to take responsibility for.
And yet all governments want to cover up.
That field, those trees.
Pull over.
I wonder if it's still there.
A tunnel from the war.
It leads under the field, and if memory serves, should end beyond the base camp.
Looks like somebody used it recently.
It must be how Ravi bypassed perimeter security.
Well, how did he know about it?
Well, it's in my old logs.
It could've come up if he did a Carentan search.
Now, you two, until we know what we're dealing with,
I'm not willing to endanger the entire team.
Aw, come on.
I could argue there's strength in numbers.
I'm sure you could, but not this time.
I guess I'll go first.
Don't even think about following.
Check our coordinates.
Yeah.
Okay, GPS says we're now behind enemy lines.
The perimeter camp is back that way.
Shh!
Listen.
It's so quiet.
Exactly.
Not even any birds.
The town's that way, beyond the treeline.
What the hell just happened?
Do you hear it?
Yeah.
Hey.
Hello.
Anglais.
Newcomers.
You were right.
You from Carentan?
Oui.
Come with us.
The last one will be very excited to meet you.
Check it out, the whole town's gone green.
It's not quite as I remember it.
I'm not sure what I expected, but it certainly wasn't this.
I don't understand.
Something's not right.
Here he is.
The last one.
Helen, Will...
Ravi!
Helen, even though it's only been six days for you,
I'm now 74 years old.
My mind says it's not possible, and yet...
I look at you.
Um, I'm sorry, Ravi.
My brain is still playing catch-up here.
You say that you arrived in Carentan six days ago?
In your time.
But in this village, 40 years has passed.
In "dome-time,"
or at least, that's what I call it.
It's a massive time dilation field, and you can't leave?
Anyone who tries to pass through the boundary and re-enter the normal time stream is killed instantly.
There's an intense dimensional recoil.
It's like being hit by a train.
So we're trapped inside an invisible time dome...
In France.
Awkward, but it does explain a lot.
Oh, yeah, it makes complete sense.
Come with me.
There's someone I want you to meet.
Anna!
Newcomers.
Welcome.
Helen, Will, this is my wife, Anna.
This used to be an old Nazi bunker.
Fond memories.
Of course.
But as I was saying, the time stream first erupted just over three weeks ago your time.
The epicenter was in a cave off the cliffs.
That's when the disappearances started.
The French government thought they had a Bermuda Triangle on their hands, so at first they sent in scientists.
Who never returned.
Then they sent in the military, who also never returned, and then, no one.
Until you...
The last one.
The rest, as they say, is history.
Literally.
So all this equipment...
Was already here, or brought in since.
Previous experiments?
The result of over 100 years of research by top scientists in France and the military, trying to understand the time stream, trying to solve it, dissolve it, and yet...
Here we are.
God, I can't believe it.
What?
I destroyed a massive fire elemental back in 1944.
Drove it into the Earth less than half a mile from here, and now this?
You don't think this is your fault?
Well, it can't be a coincidence.
I have to admit, the thought did occur to me, but I haven't been able to find a connection.
Anna told me we had newcomers.
Josie, Helen, Will.
Josie is the granddaughter of the first French scientist to enter Carentan.
An excellent assistant.
She's also a natural at mathematics.
I also make sure he does not forget to eat his lunch.
Of course.
Let's go, Anna hates it when I'm late.
So easy to lose track of time when there's three years of daylight.
So one day of our time is equal to six years inside Carentan.
Three years of daylight, followed by three years of night.
The dark time.
Your 12-hour cycle translated into our years.
We're cut off, remember, from the outside world, so we have to stockpile all our resources.
Food from the harvests.
Energy from the solar panels, but it is never enough.
The stores of energy are the first to go.
Then the food runs out.
The last few months...
Only the youngest and the strongest make it through to the sunrise.
How long until the next dark time?
Nine months, in dome time.
But out there...
Less than three hours.
What if they don't come back?
They will.
Yeah, but what if they don't?
Then we'll go in after them.
What if we don't come back?
Well, then at least we'll be in there.
This is pointless.
You heard Magnus.
Yeah, she said "don't go in the tunnel."
Right.
But that doesn't mean we're supposed to sit around with our thumb up--
What is your point?
My point is, we're learning nothing here.
Let's go.
Freeze!
Stay right there.
Aw, crap...
Your colleagues did a very stupid thing.
They may be lost forever.
Look, you know what's going on, so just tell us.
Maybe he doesn't know.
Maybe no one knows what's happening in Carentan.
Impound their vehicle, put them in the supply tent.
Sir.
Let's go.
Some of this handwriting is practically indecipherable.
A combination of poor penmanship and homemade inks.
French, German, English.
Was none of this research computerized?
At first, but then they realized how risky that was.
Hard drives weren't built to last 150 years.
I barely feel like I've made a dent at all.
You've only been at it a week.
Give yourself time.
Time...
Time dilation.
Adam Worth and the time nodes.
Yet this can't have been his doing.
He died months ago in Hollow Earth.
In all my years here,
I've explored every square inch of the boundary.
There's no device anywhere.
Do you never feel like giving up?
Just quitting?
Every day.
What keeps you going?
You.
I wanted to see the look on your face when I cracked this mother.
Well, let's get to it, then, shall we?
You take these readings every week?
The dome's like a living thing.
We're taking its pulse.
Looking for a weakening in the energy.
Have you ever found any?
If it's so dangerous to penetrate the dome, yet you can't see it, how do you...
Careful, now, we are close.
Slowly.
Yeah, I-I feel it.
It's like my skin is tingling.
If we kept walking, it would intensify.
Let me show you.
Another three meters, and...
I saw it happen once.
A young man, just before dark time.
He started screaming and ran, and ran, and just...
Blew apart.
Hey...
Don't think about that.
There's gotta be another way out, right?
What?
It's just, I was born here.
This is the only world I have ever known.
There's a hell of a lot more world outside of Carentan.
You're gonna love it.
Thanks.
Nice bathrooms you got there.
Just keep moving.
You know, it was real sweet of you to wait for me.
Get inside.
Okay.
Of course I trust you.
It's just that there are only two functioning motherboards left.
I can't give any guarantees.
But it is a chance to communicate with the outside world.
And on a frequency we know will be monitored.
But previous transmissions have never been answered.
That's because of the time differential.
When a signal broadcast from inside the dome is received on the outside, it's incredibly condensed.
We're talking hundredths of a nanosecond.
It would barely register on the most sensitive equipment.
Which is why I'm stretching out this signal, slowing it down.
Even a simple message like, "we are alive.
Time dilation field."
Will take up two weeks to transmit.
And we're going to need uninterrupted power.
I've dedicated one of the solar panels.
All set, then.
I know they've only been gone half an hour, but this whole set-up gives me the creeps.
Yeah, me too.
I've got your location now.
Also, there's a strong satellite transmission coming from the same area.
The command tent.
Can you eavesdrop?
Signal's scrambled.
No surprise.
One more thing.
Just before your call came in, I picked up something odd.
Specifically?
Short bursts of static, like screeching white noise.
Interference?
Yeah, could be.
I'll look into it.
Ravi's asking that the solar panels be re-routed back to the battery stores.
Uh-huh.
You know, it's been three weeks since our S.O.S. call.
Yes, I know.
If the outside hasn't responded by now--
I'm fully aware of the situation, thank you.
Is there something I can help you with?
Yeah, I could really use a computer, or a proper pen and paper!
God, even a bloody slide-rule!
I'm sorry, Will.
These energy readings from the boundary?
Over a century's worth.
Do you know that when this time dilation field first came into existence, it was the size of a city block?
And now it's over 12 kilometers in diameter.
And every few decades, the pressure builds, like before an earthquake.
And when it breaks apart, the dome grows.
We know this.
But what we didn't know was that it was happening exponentially.
The energy readings from the past 20 years are climbing steadily, beyond anything we've ever measured.
So the dome's getting ready for another growth spurt.
A massive one.
Define "massive."
Half the eastern coast of France, and if it keeps growing at this rate, in 120 years, the time dilation field will blanket the entire Earth.
120 years for us...
In here, but out there-- three weeks before the planet is torn apart.
This is ridiculous.
Agreed.
I mean, I didn't even work on that time dilation node we salvaged from Worth's warehouse.
Right.
Neither did you, by the way.
Right again.
And yet here we are trying to recreate it using pieces of old laptops, and-and-and iPods, and...
What is that?
Thermostat from a toaster.
I'm sorry I asked.
Look...
We know the epicenter of the original eruption.
Now, all subsequent growth radiated from there.
If I can nullify the time dilation field at that spot-- it would burst this bubble and return Carentan to normal time?
Come on, it can't be that simple.
Well, unfortunately, you're right.
However, we are lucky in that we have decades of research at our disposal.
I sense a "but" coming.
We are missing a key element, an element found in Worth's time node.
Cerrelium.
Okay, so where do we find that?
Hollow Earth.
Perfect.
Or...
From the time node that Henry dismantled.
At the Sanctuary?
Mm.
In case you've forgotten, we can't just reach out and touch someone.
You know, I've been thinking about that, and I may have a way.
You were right.
This is the ultimate slow-broadcast message.
It's no wonder the satellites couldn't pick up any movement in Carentan.
In real-world time, we're moving so fast, we're not even a blur.
We are invisible.
But this should get somebody's attention.
Look at him.
I remember the early days.
It wasn't easy.
Go, talk to him.
Evening.
May I sit down?
Sure, please.
So, how are you?
I'm okay.
You?
Every day a new bone creaks.
But it does get easier, you know.
I'm not sure I want it to.
When did you...
Give up?
I was going to say "surrender."
I can't recall a specific moment.
I guess it happened gradually, a day at a time.
Next thing I knew, one day had turned into decades.
And you don't miss the real world?
Of course I do, but I've got a family here now, a life.
So it wasn't just interference?
It was an extremely compressed radio signal.
From here?
From Carentan.
It's Magnus!
Number 37... 750 gauss.
Probably too much copper.
Yeah.
You know, I-I think I need another coil here.
Did I see one in the tool box?
Happy Birthday.
I can't believe you remembered.
Neither can I.
Can I open it?
Yeah, but I-I don't want you to get too excited, okay?
It's nothing much.
It's beautiful.
See, I think I screwed up the clasp--
Oh, be quiet.
See, I knew it.
I love it.
I'm glad you like it.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have--
No, no, no, no...
It's just complicated.
Abby.
Complicated.
Not for me.
But, see, you're...
And she's the past, and...
Dark time is coming.
If we make it through the famine years till sunrise...
I want to have a baby.
Hey, Magnus.
How's everything?
Great.
Yeah.
I'll go get us some lunch.
Anything you want to tell me?
No.
About the magnetic readings?
Oh, that.
Uh, yeah.
None of the metals that we smelted together have nearly enough gauss as cerrelium.
Damn.
Means we'll have to wait and hope that someone's seen the rock signal.
And what if they do?
I mean, that could take years in our time to get that node here, and even then, there's no guarantee that it's going to work.
No, there isn't.
Yeah.
Will--
No, look...
You're immortal, essentially, but I'm not.
I mean, has it ever occurred to you that we may not solve this problem in my lifetime?
Time dilation field?
Her message is irrefutable evidence they're still alive!
And they need help, so let's move!
Your colleagues took it upon themselves to break through the barrier.
Their fate is their own responsibility.
So, what the hell are you and your boys doing here, then?
'Cause you're certainly not helping anyone trapped in Carentan.
There is a plan.
It's in motion.
Oh, yeah, right.
Hey, this satellite feed...
How long has this been here?
A few minutes ago.
It suddenly appeared.
That's an elemental symbol.
Not according to my science guys.
No element on earth like that.
True.
It's the symbol for cerrelium.
An element found...
Elsewhere.
All personnel.
Project Greenhouse is a go.
T-minus 37 minutes.
Mark.
This is a message from Magnus and Will.
What does it mean?
Uh, it's hard to explain, but give us time.
Time, you don't have.
The field is expanding.
My job is to stop it.
Project Greenhouse.
It's an air strike.
They're going to blow Carentan off the map.
Even if you put the time node piecesonaplanerightnow--
There's no way we're going to beat the air strike.
Does it have to be cerrelium?
There must be something else we can substitute.
I don't know...
Okay, Biggie, remember last week when you were making that bouillabaisse, and you ran out of saffron, so you used turmeric instead, and it tasted just as good.
Did not.
You get my point.
All right, let's give it a shot.
What do you got in your kitchen over there?
Should be just up ahead.
By the way, Will,
Happy New Year.
Somehow I don't feel like celebrating.
You see that sky?
Sunset's beginning.
45 days until nightfall.
The solar panels will go dead, we'll lose power to the lab.
Which is why we're testing this node now.
Here we are, the epicenter of the original disturbance.
You know, without the cerrelium...
I agree, and if time weren't forcing my hand, I'd wait, but what choice do we have?
Say a prayer.
Turn it off!
Bloody hell!
Ravi?
Ravi!
Your experiment, my God.
What happened?
People disappeared.
What do you mean?
Everything went very fast, then slow, and then they were gone.
Just vanished?
I saw one of them with my own eyes.
Andre.
He was re-sheeting one of the solar panels.
He fell, but vanished before he hit the ground.
Magnus, what have we done?
Four people were vaporized because our experiment failed.
What if it didn't fail?
What if, for a few seconds, we managed to diffuse the time dilation field?
Well, then why did those people disappear?
Because when Carentan resets itself to real world time, they don't exist.
In your time, they haven't been born yet.
Okay, okay, so...
If we get the cerrelium, stabilize the node, make it work properly...
Then anything inside this dome that was created after its inception, equipment, animals, people, will cease to exist.
And the only people who'll survive the reset...
The three of us.
Everybody else...
No!
No...
Josie...
Josie, wait!
Josie, wait!
Hey, stop!
Look at me!
We didn't know!
We didn't know.
We didn't know.
But now you do.
So are you going to continue your experiments, even though we would all just...
How could you just...
Disappear me?
Oh, beauty.
It's not going to be easy walking a surface-to-air missile past these guys.
We don't need the whole missile.
The alloy Biggie mentioned is the thruster stage.
It's part of the heat shield.
Uh, I don't suppose you have a screwdriver?
Penknife?
Yeah.
Here.
Oh, come to mama...
Okay.
You're going to need this.
Thanks.
Hold your fire!
What the hell was that all about?
It's not cerrelium, but I was able to use parts of the missile they sent.
How's it going?
As usual, slower than I'd like.
Hopefully this new shielding will do the trick.
One more stunt like that, and the next bullet goes in your head.
To hell with you!
There are people alive in there!
There's still a chance to save them!
Not in the next nine minutes.
The birds are already in the air.
Let's go.
I don't hate you.
If the dome continues to spread, continents shifting at lightning speed...
Oceans born in the blink of an eye...
The stress on the Earth's core will rip this planet apart.
I understand all that.
Like you, I'm a scientist, but I'm also a husband.
The sun has almost set.
Are you ready?
Can I really be doing this?
Please, dear,
I can't talk about this anymore.
If our small sacrifice can save billions of people...
You were always the stronger one.
Whenever the children got sick,
I would worry so much, but you-- we will never leave you, I promise.
If you don't see us here, look here.
That's where we will be.
Always.
Now, go, my love.
It's time for you to be the strong one.
The shielding is as secure as it'll ever be.
It's been a long time, not a good time.
I just wish I knew how to say goodbye.
It's Ravi!
There's a crowd in the street.
I told them that you'd come out and speak with them.
They're watching the front of the mayor's office.
All right, we'll go through the basement and out the back.
I don't know how long I can hold them.
Every second counts.
Thank you.
Just listen to us!
The time dilation field's a massive concentration of energy.
You hit that sucker with a bomb, and there is no telling what the fallout will be!
You still don't get it, do you?
The train has left the station.
Whatever happens, it's all going to be over in 60 seconds.
Magnus!
Will!
What is it?
You've got to hurry.
I couldn't hold them.
They have found out where you are.
Stop!
Stop!
Josie...
Josie, don't do this.
Helen, get away from that machine.
Please.
Who the hell are you to say who lives and who dies?
Josie!
No!
We made it.
Ravi didn't.
Anyone else?
After the reset, we were found in the field.
Kate said something about a...
An air strike that was called off at the last second, but I was still pretty groggy.
I could have dreamt that.
They had a million questions, but I told them to let you sleep.
Thank you...
But now we need to get to work.
Something, or someone, is behind what happened in Carentan.
I feel it in my gut.
You're not blaming yourself, are you?
Until I know differently.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Previously on Sanctuary...
It's your fault, Normandy 1944,
Allied invasion.
You were on French soil when it happened.
Carentan?
Carentan is a very bad place.
Why don't we just attack this weather device?
If we simply blow it up, the creature they're using to power it could do massive damage.
There's no way to really kill a fire elemental.
Is there a way that you can force down?
I appreciate it, Ravi, thank you.
I need you to visit the Mumbai Sanctuary.
Ravi is the head of house.
Dr. Zimmerman,
Ms. Freelander, namaste.
Call me Ravi.
He pretty much saved my life, twice.
Will!
What happened?
Unbelievable!
Did you say Carentan?
In Normandy?
Yeah, I thought it might ring a bell.
It does indeed.
How many are missing?
Well, it's hard to say exactly.
There's a media blackout, and my usual sources are strangely silent.
You have the partial list there.
Yeah, uh, a local farmer...
And his livestock.
A couple of backpacking tourists, and a busload of senior citizens.
All disappeared without a trace within a ten-kilometer radius of Carentan.
And no word from any of the residents?
No response to phone calls or emails, not even from the local police, and did you see that sat-link I sent you?
Yeah, I'm calling it up now.
Censored?
By whom?
There's the rub.
And Ravi went in five days ago?
He was already in Paris wrapping up the Bipedal Conference, so I figured-
No, absolutely, you made the right call.
I discovered he was sending a video log back to his computer at the Mumbai Sanctuary.
I called up his last post.
Take a look at this.
I'm inside the first checkpoint now, and I think I'm getting closer to the perimeter of the disturbance.
According to my estimates, it's within...
I'm feeling a strange tingling sensation-
Since then, nothing.
All contact was instantly lost.
It was like he disappeared off the face of the planet.

To geo-map his last location, nice.

Looks like a couple miles from the town center.
Okay, so if Ravi did find a way in, that would be our access point.
Stay sharp.
...And have the TAC team standing by, just in case.
They're ready and waiting at Plymouth Naval Base.
It's just a 30-minute hop across the channel, if need be.
Good.
I'm leaving now.
I'll meet you there.
Ah...
Do you think that's wise?
We're already down one Sanctuary head.
Until I know what we're dealing with-
I was the one who sent Ravi in there.
I'm responsible.
So with all due respect, Guv, I'll see you at De Gaulle.
Cheeky bugger.
So, 65 years later...
Look a little different without the barbed wire and swastikas?
Ever so slightly.
Heads up.
What's the situation here?
Industrial spill.
We're asking everybody to turn back.
But I believe one of my colleagues-
Sorry, ma'am, until clean-up is complete, the area is off-limits.
Oh, bumpy roads...
You're not going to get carsick again?
She's been very, very sick.
Oh, God...
She's been really sick.
Nicely done.
Arretez!
Who's in charge here?
I am.
Dr. Magnus...
Inside.
Just you.
You know who I am.
Let's just say your reputation precedes you.
Wish I could say the same about you.
I don't have a name, not as far as you're concerned.
Right, then.
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?
This Hazmat dog-and-pony show is a joke.
If there was a real radiation risk, you and your boys would be suited up.
Atmospherics from the area came back clean as a whistle.
No large industries for over a hundred kilometers.
Oh, and, by the way, you've got at least two trucks outside full of surface-to-air missiles.
Starstreaks, if I'm not mistaken.
Now, I had no idea they could be used to clean up a toxic spill.
You know the only reason you're still alive is because of who you are?
And I'm not leaving until I get some answers.
Now, one of my colleagues-
Ravi Ganapathiraman?
Have you seen him?
Six days ago.
Like you, he was stopped at our first checkpoint, and he was ordered to turn back.
But he didn't.
Is he alive?
Take your people, leave.
Now.
You know who I am, therefore you know what I do.
Whatever's going on here, maybe I can help.
This is above your pay grade, doctor.
Yeah, even you.
Well, whoever he is, he's clearly ex-military.
He's not French army.
Yeah, generic uniforms, no markings on the vehicles.
Some sort of private international security force.
Yet he's clearly acting with the approval of the French government, and yet his mandate's being rigorously shielded by intelligence agencies worldwide.
Well, something very big and very bad is going on inside that town.
Something no government wants to take responsibility for.
And yet all governments want to cover up.
That field, those trees.
Pull over.
I wonder if it's still there.
A tunnel from the war.
It leads under the field, and if memory serves, should end beyond the base camp.
Looks like somebody used it recently.
It must be how Ravi bypassed perimeter security.
Well, how did he know about it?
Well, it's in my old logs.
It could've come up if he did a Carentan search.
Now, you two, until we know what we're dealing with,
I'm not willing to endanger the entire team.
Aw, come on.
I could argue there's strength in numbers.
I'm sure you could, but not this time.
I guess I'll go first.
Don't even think about following.
Check our coordinates.
Yeah.
Okay, GPS says we're now behind enemy lines.
The perimeter camp is back that way.
Shh!
Listen.
It's so quiet.
Exactly.
Not even any birds.
The town's that way, beyond the treeline.
What the hell just happened?
Do you hear it?
Yeah.
Hey.
Hello.
Anglais.
Newcomers.
You were right.
You from Carentan?
Oui.
Come with us.
The last one will be very excited to meet you.
Check it out, the whole town's gone green.
It's not quite as I remember it.
I'm not sure what I expected, but it certainly wasn't this.
I don't understand.
Something's not right.
Here he is.
The last one.
Helen, Will...
Ravi!
Helen, even though it's only been six days for you,
I'm now 74 years old.
My mind says it's not possible, and yet...
I look at you.
Um, I'm sorry, Ravi.
My brain is still playing catch-up here.
You say that you arrived in Carentan six days ago?
In your time.
But in this village, 40 years has passed.
In "dome-time,"
or at least, that's what I call it.
It's a massive time dilation field, and you can't leave?
Anyone who tries to pass through the boundary and re-enter the normal time stream is killed instantly.
There's an intense dimensional recoil.
It's like being hit by a train.
So we're trapped inside an invisible time dome...
In France.
Awkward, but it does explain a lot.
Oh, yeah, it makes complete sense.
Come with me.
There's someone I want you to meet.
Anna!
Newcomers.
Welcome.
Helen, Will, this is my wife, Anna.
This used to be an old Nazi bunker.
Fond memories.
Of course.
But as I was saying, the time stream first erupted just over three weeks ago your time.
The epicenter was in a cave off the cliffs.
That's when the disappearances started.
The French government thought they had a Bermuda Triangle on their hands, so at first they sent in scientists.
Who never returned.
Then they sent in the military, who also never returned, and then, no one.
Until you...
The last one.
The rest, as they say, is history.
Literally.
So all this equipment...
Was already here, or brought in since.
Previous experiments?
The result of over 100 years of research by top scientists in France and the military, trying to understand the time stream, trying to solve it, dissolve it, and yet...
Here we are.
God, I can't believe it.
What?
I destroyed a massive fire elemental back in 1944.
Drove it into the Earth less than half a mile from here, and now this?
You don't think this is your fault?
Well, it can't be a coincidence.
I have to admit, the thought did occur to me, but I haven't been able to find a connection.
Anna told me we had newcomers.
Josie, Helen, Will.
Josie is the granddaughter of the first French scientist to enter Carentan.
An excellent assistant.
She's also a natural at mathematics.
I also make sure he does not forget to eat his lunch.
Of course.
Let's go, Anna hates it when I'm late.
So easy to lose track of time when there's three years of daylight.
So one day of our time is equal to six years inside Carentan.
Three years of daylight, followed by three years of night.
The dark time.
Your 12-hour cycle translated into our years.
We're cut off, remember, from the outside world, so we have to stockpile all our resources.
Food from the harvests.
Energy from the solar panels, but it is never enough.
The stores of energy are the first to go.
Then the food runs out.
The last few months...
Only the youngest and the strongest make it through to the sunrise.
How long until the next dark time?
Nine months, in dome time.
But out there...
Less than three hours.
What if they don't come back?
They will.
Yeah, but what if they don't?
Then we'll go in after them.
What if we don't come back?
Well, then at least we'll be in there.
This is pointless.
You heard Magnus.
Yeah, she said "don't go in the tunnel. "
Right.
But that doesn't mean we're supposed to sit around with our thumb up-
What is your point?
My point is, we're learning nothing here.
Let's go.
Freeze!
Stay right there.
Aw, crap...
Your colleagues did a very stupid thing.
They may be lost forever.
Look, you know what's going on, so just tell us.
Maybe he doesn't know.
Maybe no one knows what's happening in Carentan.
Impound their vehicle, put them in the supply tent.
Sir.
Let's go.
Some of this handwriting is practically indecipherable.
A combination of poor penmanship and homemade inks.
French, German, English.
Was none of this research computerized?
At first, but then they realized how risky that was.
Hard drives weren't built to last 150 years.
I barely feel like I've made a dent at all.
You've only been at it a week.
Give yourself time.
Time...
Time dilation.
Adam Worth and the time nodes.
Yet this can't have been his doing.
He died months ago in Hollow Earth.
In all my years here,
I've explored every square inch of the boundary.
There's no device anywhere.
Do you never feel like giving up?
Just quitting?
Every day.
What keeps you going?
You.
I wanted to see the look on your face when I cracked this mother.
Well, let's get to it, then, shall we?
You take these readings every week?
The dome's like a living thing.
We're taking its pulse.
Looking for a weakening in the energy.
Have you ever found any?
If it's so dangerous to penetrate the dome, yet you can't see it, how do you...
Careful, now, we are close.
Slowly.
Yeah, I-I feel it.
It's like my skin is tingling.
If we kept walking, it would intensify.
Let me show you.
Another three meters, and...
I saw it happen once.
A young man, just before dark time.
He started screaming and ran, and ran, and just...
Blew apart.
Hey...
Don't think about that.
There's gotta be another way out, right?
What?
It's just, I was born here.
This is the only world I have ever known.
There's a hell of a lot more world outside of Carentan.
You're gonna love it.
Thanks.
Nice bathrooms you got there.
Just keep moving.
You know, it was real sweet of you to wait for me.
Get inside.
Okay.
Of course I trust you.
It's just that there are only two functioning motherboards left.
I can't give any guarantees.
But it is a chance to communicate with the outside world.
And on a frequency we know will be monitored.
But previous transmissions have never been answered.
That's because of the time differential.
When a signal broadcast from inside the dome is received on the outside, it's incredibly condensed.
We're talking hundredths of a nanosecond.
It would barely register on the most sensitive equipment.
Which is why I'm stretching out this signal, slowing it down.
Even a simple message like, "we are alive.
Time dilation field. "
Will take up two weeks to transmit.
And we're going to need uninterrupted power.
I've dedicated one of the solar panels.
All set, then.
I know they've only been gone half an hour, but this whole set-up gives me the creeps.
Yeah, me too.
I've got your location now.
Also, there's a strong satellite transmission coming from the same area.
The command tent.
Can you eavesdrop?
Signal's scrambled.
No surprise.
One more thing.
Just before your call came in, I picked up something odd.
Specifically?
Short bursts of static, like screeching white noise.
Interference?
Yeah, could be.
I'll look into it.
Ravi's asking that the solar panels be re-routed back to the battery stores.
Uh-huh.
You know, it's been three weeks since our S.O.S. call.
Yes, I know.
If the outside hasn't responded by now-
I'm fully aware of the situation, thank you.
Is there something I can help you with?
Yeah, I could really use a computer, or a proper pen and paper!
God, even a bloody slide-rule!
I'm sorry, Will.
These energy readings from the boundary?
Over a century's worth.
Do you know that when this time dilation field first came into existence, it was the size of a city block?
And now it's over 12 kilometers in diameter.
And every few decades, the pressure builds, like before an earthquake.
And when it breaks apart, the dome grows.
We know this.
But what we didn't know was that it was happening exponentially.
The energy readings from the past 20 years are climbing steadily, beyond anything we've ever measured.
So the dome's getting ready for another growth spurt.
A massive one.
Define "massive. "
Half the eastern coast of France, and if it keeps growing at this rate, in 120 years, the time dilation field will blanket the entire Earth.
120 years for us...
In here, but out there- three weeks before the planet is torn apart.
This is ridiculous.
Agreed.
I mean, I didn't even work on that time dilation node we salvaged from Worth's warehouse.
Right.
Neither did you, by the way.
Right again.
And yet here we are trying to recreate it using pieces of old laptops, and-and-and iPods, and...
What is that?
Thermostat from a toaster.
I'm sorry I asked.
Look...
We know the epicenter of the original eruption.
Now, all subsequent growth radiated from there.
If I can nullify the time dilation field at that spot- it would burst this bubble and return Carentan to normal time?
Come on, it can't be that simple.
Well, unfortunately, you're right.
However, we are lucky in that we have decades of research at our disposal.
I sense a "but" coming.
We are missing a key element, an element found in Worth's time node.
Cerrelium.
Okay, so where do we find that?
Hollow Earth.
Perfect.
Or...
From the time node that Henry dismantled.
At the Sanctuary?
Mm.
In case you've forgotten, we can't just reach out and touch someone.
You know, I've been thinking about that, and I may have a way.
You were right.
This is the ultimate slow-broadcast message.
It's no wonder the satellites couldn't pick up any movement in Carentan.
In real-world time, we're moving so fast, we're not even a blur.
We are invisible.
But this should get somebody's attention.
Look at him.
I remember the early days.
It wasn't easy.
Go, talk to him.
Evening.
May I sit down?
Sure, please.
So, how are you?
I'm okay.
You?
Every day a new bone creaks.
But it does get easier, you know.
I'm not sure I want it to.
When did you...
Give up?
I was going to say "surrender. "
I can't recall a specific moment.
I guess it happened gradually, a day at a time.
Next thing I knew, one day had turned into decades.
And you don't miss the real world?
Of course I do, but I've got a family here now, a life.
So it wasn't just interference?
It was an extremely compressed radio signal.
From here?
From Carentan.
It's Magnus!
Number 37... 750 gauss.
Probably too much copper.
Yeah.
You know, I-I think I need another coil here.
Did I see one in the tool box?
Happy Birthday.
I can't believe you remembered.
Neither can I.
Can I open it?
Yeah, but I-I don't want you to get too excited, okay?
It's nothing much.
It's beautiful.
See, I think I screwed up the clasp-
Oh, be quiet.
See, I knew it.
I love it.
I'm glad you like it.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have-
No, no, no, no...
It's just complicated.
Abby.
Complicated.
Not for me.
But, see, you're...
And she's the past, and...
Dark time is coming.
If we make it through the famine years till sunrise...
I want to have a baby.
Hey, Magnus.
How's everything?
Great.
Yeah.
I'll go get us some lunch.
Anything you want to tell me?
No.
About the magnetic readings?
Oh, that.
Uh, yeah.
None of the metals that we smelted together have nearly enough gauss as cerrelium.
Damn.
Means we'll have to wait and hope that someone's seen the rock signal.
And what if they do?
I mean, that could take years in our time to get that node here, and even then, there's no guarantee that it's going to work.
No, there isn't.
Yeah.
Will-
No, look...
You're immortal, essentially, but I'm not.
I mean, has it ever occurred to you that we may not solve this problem in my lifetime?
Time dilation field?
Her message is irrefutable evidence they're still alive!
And they need help, so let's move!
Your colleagues took it upon themselves to break through the barrier.
Their fate is their own responsibility.
So, what the hell are you and your boys doing here, then?
'Cause you're certainly not helping anyone trapped in Carentan.
There is a plan.
It's in motion.
Oh, yeah, right.
Hey, this satellite feed...
How long has this been here?
A few minutes ago.
It suddenly appeared.
That's an elemental symbol.
Not according to my science guys.
No element on earth like that.
True.
It's the symbol for cerrelium.
An element found...
Elsewhere.
All personnel.
Project Greenhouse is a go.
T- minus 37 minutes.
Mark.
This is a message from Magnus and Will.
What does it mean?
Uh, it's hard to explain, but give us time.
Time, you don't have.
The field is expanding.
My job is to stop it.
Project Greenhouse.
It's an air strike.
They're going to blow Carentan off the map.
there's no way we're going to beat the air strike.
Does it have to be cerrelium?
There must be something else we can substitute.
I don't know...
Okay, Biggie, remember last week when you were making that bouillabaisse, and you ran out of saffron, so you used turmeric instead, and it tasted just as good.
Did not.
You get my point.
All right, let's give it a shot.
What do you got in your kitchen over there?
Should be just up ahead.
By the way, Will,
Happy New Year.
Somehow I don't feel like celebrating.
You see that sky?
Sunset's beginning.
45 days until nightfall.
The solar panels will go dead, we'll lose power to the lab.
Which is why we're testing this node now.
Here we are, the epicenter of the original disturbance.
You know, without the cerrelium...
I agree, and if time weren't forcing my hand, I'd wait, but what choice do we have?
Say a prayer.
Turn it off!
Bloody hell!
Ravi?
Ravi!
Your experiment, my God.
What happened?
People disappeared.
What do you mean?
Everything went very fast, then slow, and then they were gone.
Just vanished?
I saw one of them with my own eyes.
Andre.
He was re-sheeting one of the solar panels.
He fell, but vanished before he hit the ground.
Magnus, what have we done?
Four people were vaporized because our experiment failed.
What if it didn't fail?
What if, for a few seconds, we managed to diffuse the time dilation field?
Well, then why did those people disappear?
Because when Carentan resets itself to real world time, they don't exist.
In your time, they haven't been born yet.
Okay, okay, so...
If we get the cerrelium, stabilize the node, make it work properly...
Then anything inside this dome that was created after its inception, equipment, animals, people, will cease to exist.
And the only people who'll survive the reset...
The three of us.
Everybody else...
No!
No...
Josie...
Josie, wait!
Josie, wait!
Hey, stop!
Look at me!
We didn't know!
We didn't know.
We didn't know.
But now you do.
So are you going to continue your experiments, even though we would all just...
How could you just...
Disappear me?
Oh, beauty.
It's not going to be easy walking a surface-to-air missile past these guys.
We don't need the whole missile.
The alloy Biggie mentioned is the thruster stage.
It's part of the heat shield.
Uh, I don't suppose you have a screwdriver?
Penknife?
Yeah.
Here.
Oh, come to mama...
Okay.
You're going to need this.
Thanks.
Hold your fire!
What the hell was that all about?
It's not cerrelium, but I was able to use parts of the missile they sent.
How's it going?
As usual, slower than I'd like.
Hopefully this new shielding will do the trick.
One more stunt like that, and the next bullet goes in your head.
To hell with you!
There are people alive in there!
There's still a chance to save them!
Not in the next nine minutes.
The birds are already in the air.
Let's go.
I don't hate you.
If the dome continues to spread, continents shifting at lightning speed...
Oceans born in the blink of an eye...
The stress on the Earth's core will rip this planet apart.
I understand all that.
Like you, I'm a scientist, but I'm also a husband.
The sun has almost set.
Are you ready?
Can I really be doing this?
Please, dear,
I can't talk about this anymore.
If our small sacrifice can save billions of people...
You were always the stronger one.
Whenever the children got sick,
I would worry so much, but you- we will never leave you, I promise.
If you don't see us here, look here.
That's where we will be.
Always.
Now, go, my love.
It's time for you to be the strong one.
The shielding is as secure as it'll ever be.
It's been a long time, not a good time.
I just wish I knew how to say goodbye.
It's Ravi!
There's a crowd in the street.
I told them that you'd come out and speak with them.
They're watching the front of the mayor's office.
All right, we'll go through the basement and out the back.
I don't know how long I can hold them.
Every second counts.
Thank you.
Just listen to us!
The time dilation field's a massive concentration of energy.
You hit that sucker with a bomb, and there is no telling what the fallout will be!
You still don't get it, do you?
The train has left the station.
Whatever happens, it's all going to be over in 60 seconds.
Magnus!
Will!
What is it?
You've got to hurry.
I couldn't hold them.
They have found out where you are.
Stop!
Stop!
Josie...
Josie, don't do this.
Helen, get away from that machine.
Please.
Who the hell are you to say who lives and who dies?
Josie!
No!
We made it.
Ravi didn't.
Anyone else?
After the reset, we were found in the field.
Kate said something about a...
An air strike that was called off at the last second, but I was still pretty groggy.
I could have dreamt that.
They had a million questions, but I told them to let you sleep.
Thank you...
But now we need to get to work.
Something, or someone, is behind what happened in Carentan.
I feel it in my gut.
You're not blaming yourself, are you?
Until I know differently.
= sync by elderman =
Previously on Sanctuary...
It's your fault, Normandy 1944,
Allied invasion.
You were on French soil when it happened.
Carentan?
Carentan is a very bad place.
Why don't we just attack this weather device?
If we simply blow it up, the creature they're using to power it could do massive damage.
There's no way to really kill a fire elemental.
Is there a way that you can force down?
I appreciate it, Ravi, thank you.
I need you to visit the Mumbai Sanctuary.
Ravi is the head of house.
Dr. Zimmerman,
Ms. Freelander, namaste.
Call me Ravi.
He pretty much saved my life, twice.
Will!
What happened?
Unbelievable!
Did you say Carentan?
In Normandy?
Yeah, I thought it might ring a bell.
It does indeed.
How many are missing?
Well, it's hard to say exactly.
There's a media blackout, and my usual sources are strangely silent.
You have the partial list there.
Yeah, uh, a local farmer...
And his livestock.
A couple of backpacking tourists, and a busload of senior citizens.
All disappeared without a trace within a ten-kilometer radius of Carentan.
And no word from any of the residents?
No response to phone calls or emails, not even from the local police, and did you see that sat-link I sent you?
Yeah, I'm calling it up now.
Censored?
By whom?
There's the rub.
And Ravi went in five days ago?
He was already in Paris wrapping up the Bipedal Conference, so I figured--
No, absolutely, you made the right call.
I discovered he was sending a video log back to his computer at the Mumbai Sanctuary.
I called up his last post.
Take a look at this.
I'm inside the first checkpoint now, and I think I'm getting closer to the perimeter of the disturbance.
According to my estimates, it's within...
I'm feeling a strange tingling sensation--
Since then, nothing.
All contact was instantly lost.
It was like he disappeared off the face of the planet.

Bastards!
That answers my question.
The French government, now Interpol.
Complete stonewall.
I know the feeling.
C.I.A.?
Schtum .
MI-6?
Waiting for a call back.
I've got a bridge I want to sell you.
Precisely.
Are you getting the feeling we've been kicked out of the treehouse here?
It's like all our reciprocal agreements have been rescinded overnight.
Which means whatever's happening in Carentan must be terrifying the hell out of them.
I've just come from the regional Magistrate's office.
Like blood from a stone, and apparently the Surete now wants me to leave the country within 12 hours, which, of course, only makes me more determined to stay.
I'm inside the first checkpoint now, and I think I'm getting closer to the perimeter of the disturbance.
According to my estimates, it's within...
I'm feeling a strange tingling sensation--
Any abnormal you heard of discharge energy like that?
Several, but they leave radiation signatures in the atmosphere, and we don't have any spikes in that area.
Gulfstream's on standby.
You ready?
Almost.
This would go a lot faster with Hank's help, by the way, but apparently they don't have phones in sweat lodges.
That's the last time we give him the weekend off to commune with his inner wolf.
Okay, so we used the background landscape from Ravi's video...
And the towers the cell signal bounced off...
To geo-map his last location, nice.
Exactly.
Oh, we got a hit.
Looks like a couple miles from the town center.
Okay, so if Ravi did find a way in, that would be our access point.
Stay sharp.
...And have the TAC team standing by, just in case.
They're ready and waiting at Plymouth Naval Base.
It's just a 30-minute hop across the channel, if need be.
Good.
I'm leaving now.
I'll meet you there.
Ah...
Do you think that's wise?
We're already down one Sanctuary head.
Until I know what we're dealing with--
I was the one who sent Ravi in there.
I'm responsible.
So with all due respect, Guv, I'll see you at De Gaulle.
Cheeky bugger.
So, 65 years later...
Look a little different without the barbed wire and swastikas?
Ever so slightly.
Heads up.
What's the situation here?
Industrial spill.
We're asking everybody to turn back.
But I believe one of my colleagues--
Sorry, ma'am, until clean-up is complete, the area is off-limits.
Oh, bumpy roads...
You're not going to get carsick again?
She's been very, very sick.
Oh, God...
She's been really sick.
Nicely done.
Arretez!
Who's in charge here?
I am.
Dr. Magnus...
Inside.
Just you.
You know who I am.
Let's just say your reputation precedes you.
Wish I could say the same about you.
I don't have a name, not as far as you're concerned.
Right, then.
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?
This Hazmat dog-and-pony show is a joke.
If there was a real radiation risk, you and your boys would be suited up.
Atmospherics from the area came back clean as a whistle.
No large industries for over a hundred kilometers.
Oh, and, by the way, you've got at least two trucks outside full of surface-to-air missiles.
Starstreaks , if I'm not mistaken.
Now, I had no idea they could be used to clean up a toxic spill.
You know the only reason you're still alive is because of who you are?
And I'm not leaving until I get some answers.
Now, one of my colleagues--
Ravi Ganapathiraman?
Have you seen him?
Six days ago.
Like you, he was stopped at our first checkpoint, and he was ordered to turn back.
But he didn't.
Is he alive?
Take your people, leave.
Now.
You know who I am, therefore you know what I do.
Whatever's going on here, maybe I can help.
This is above your pay grade, doctor.
Yeah, even you.
Well, whoever he is, he's clearly ex-military.
He's not French army.
Yeah, generic uniforms, no markings on the vehicles.
Some sort of private international security force.
Yet he's clearly acting with the approval of the French government, and yet his mandate's being rigorously shielded by intelligence agencies worldwide.
Well, something very big and very bad is going on inside that town.
Something no government wants to take responsibility for.
And yet all governments want to cover up.
That field, those trees.
Pull over.
I wonder if it's still there.
A tunnel from the war.
It leads under the field, and if memory serves, should end beyond the base camp.
Looks like somebody used it recently.
It must be how Ravi bypassed perimeter security.
Well, how did he know about it?
Well, it's in my old logs.
It could've come up if he did a Carentan search.
Now, you two, until we know what we're dealing with,
I'm not willing to endanger the entire team.
Aw, come on.
I could argue there's strength in numbers.
I'm sure you could, but not this time.
I guess I'll go first.
Don't even think about following.
Check our coordinates.
Yeah.
Okay, GPS says we're now behind enemy lines.
The perimeter camp is back that way.
Shh!
Listen.
It's so quiet.
Exactly.
Not even any birds.
The town's that way, beyond the treeline.
What the hell just happened?
Do you hear it?
Yeah.
Hey.
Hello.
Anglais.
Newcomers.
You were right.
You from Carentan?
Oui.
Come with us.
The last one will be very excited to meet you.
Check it out, the whole town's gone green.
It's not quite as I remember it.
I'm not sure what I expected, but it certainly wasn't this.
I don't understand.
Something's not right.
Here he is.
The last one.
Helen, Will...
Ravi!
Helen, even though it's only been six days for you,
I'm now 74 years old.
My mind says it's not possible, and yet...
I look at you.
Um, I'm sorry, Ravi.
My brain is still playing catch-up here.
You say that you arrived in Carentan six days ago?
In your time.
But in this village, 40 years has passed.
In "dome-time,"
or at least, that's what I call it.
It's a massive time dilation field, and you can't leave?
Anyone who tries to pass through the boundary and re-enter the normal time stream is killed instantly.
There's an intense dimensional recoil.
It's like being hit by a train.
So we're trapped inside an invisible time dome...
In France.
Awkward, but it does explain a lot.
Oh, yeah, it makes complete sense.
Come with me.
There's someone I want you to meet.
Anna!
Newcomers.
Welcome.
Helen, Will, this is my wife, Anna.
This used to be an old Nazi bunker.
Fond memories.
Of course.
But as I was saying, the time stream first erupted just over three weeks ago your time.
The epicenter was in a cave off the cliffs.
That's when the disappearances started.
The French government thought they had a Bermuda Triangle on their hands, so at first they sent in scientists.
Who never returned.
Then they sent in the military, who also never returned, and then, no one.
Until you...
The last one.
The rest, as they say, is history.
Literally.
So all this equipment...
Was already here, or brought in since.
Previous experiments?
The result of over 100 years of research by top scientists in France and the military, trying to understand the time stream, trying to solve it, dissolve it, and yet...
Here we are.
God, I can't believe it.
What?
I destroyed a massive fire elemental back in 1944.
Drove it into the Earth less than half a mile from here, and now this?
You don't think this is your fault?
Well, it can't be a coincidence.
I have to admit, the thought did occur to me, but I haven't been able to find a connection.
Anna told me we had newcomers.
Josie, Helen, Will.
Josie is the granddaughter of the first French scientist to enter Carentan.
An excellent assistant.
She's also a natural at mathematics.
I also make sure he does not forget to eat his lunch.
Of course.
Let's go, Anna hates it when I'm late.
So easy to lose track of time when there's three years of daylight.
So one day of our time is equal to six years inside Carentan.
Three years of daylight, followed by three years of night.
The dark time.
Your 12-hour cycle translated into our years.
We're cut off, remember, from the outside world, so we have to stockpile all our resources.
Food from the harvests.
Energy from the solar panels, but it is never enough.
The stores of energy are the first to go.
Then the food runs out.
The last few months...
Only the youngest and the strongest make it through to the sunrise.
How long until the next dark time?
Nine months, in dome time.
But out there...
Less than three hours.
What if they don't come back?
They will.
Yeah, but what if they don't?
Then we'll go in after them.
What if we don't come back?
Well, then at least we'll be in there.
This is pointless.
You heard Magnus.
Yeah, she said "don't go in the tunnel."
Right.
But that doesn't mean we're supposed to sit around with our thumb up--
What is your point?
My point is, we're learning nothing here.
Let's go.
Freeze!
Stay right there.
Aw, crap...
Your colleagues did a very stupid thing.
They may be lost forever.
Look, you know what's going on, so just tell us.
Maybe he doesn't know.
Maybe no one knows what's happening in Carentan.
Impound their vehicle, put them in the supply tent.
Sir.
Let's go.
Some of this handwriting is practically indecipherable.
A combination of poor penmanship and homemade inks.
French, German, English.
Was none of this research computerized?
At first, but then they realized how risky that was.
Hard drives weren't built to last 150 years.
I barely feel like I've made a dent at all.
You've only been at it a week.
Give yourself time.
Time...
Time dilation.
Adam Worth and the time nodes.
Yet this can't have been his doing.
He died months ago in Hollow Earth.
In all my years here,
I've explored every square inch of the boundary.
There's no device anywhere.
Do you never feel like giving up?
Just quitting?
Every day.
What keeps you going?
You.
I wanted to see the look on your face when I cracked this mother.
Well, let's get to it, then, shall we?
You take these readings every week?
The dome's like a living thing.
We're taking its pulse.
Looking for a weakening in the energy.
Have you ever found any?
If it's so dangerous to penetrate the dome, yet you can't see it, how do you...
Careful, now, we are close.
Slowly.
Yeah, I-I feel it.
It's like my skin is tingling.
If we kept walking, it would intensify.
Let me show you.
Another three meters, and...
I saw it happen once.
A young man, just before dark time.
He started screaming and ran, and ran, and just...
Blew apart.
Hey...
Don't think about that.
There's gotta be another way out, right?
What?
It's just, I was born here.
This is the only world I have ever known.
There's a hell of a lot more world outside of Carentan.
You're gonna love it.
Thanks.
Nice bathrooms you got there.
Just keep moving.
You know, it was real sweet of you to wait for me.
Get inside.
Okay.
Of course I trust you.
It's just that there are only two functioning motherboards left.
I can't give any guarantees.
But it is a chance to communicate with the outside world.
And on a frequency we know will be monitored.
But previous transmissions have never been answered.
That's because of the time differential.
When a signal broadcast from inside the dome is received on the outside, it's incredibly condensed.
We're talking hundredths of a nanosecond.
It would barely register on the most sensitive equipment.
Which is why I'm stretching out this signal, slowing it down.
Even a simple message like, "we are alive.
Time dilation field."
Will take up two weeks to transmit.
And we're going to need uninterrupted power.
I've dedicated one of the solar panels.
All set, then.
I know they've only been gone half an hour, but this whole set-up gives me the creeps.
Yeah, me too.
I've got your location now.
Also, there's a strong satellite transmission coming from the same area.
The command tent.
Can you eavesdrop?
Signal's scrambled.
No surprise.
One more thing.
Just before your call came in, I picked up something odd.
Specifically?
Short bursts of static, like screeching white noise.
Interference?
Yeah, could be.
I'll look into it.
Ravi's asking that the solar panels be re-routed back to the battery stores.
Uh-huh.
You know, it's been three weeks since our S.O.S. call.
Yes, I know.
If the outside hasn't responded by now--
I'm fully aware of the situation, thank you.
Is there something I can help you with?
Yeah, I could really use a computer, or a proper pen and paper!
God, even a bloody slide-rule!
I'm sorry, Will.
These energy readings from the boundary?
Over a century's worth.
Do you know that when this time dilation field first came into existence, it was the size of a city block?
And now it's over 12 kilometers in diameter.
And every few decades, the pressure builds, like before an earthquake.
And when it breaks apart, the dome grows.
We know this.
But what we didn't know was that it was happening exponentially.
The energy readings from the past 20 years are climbing steadily, beyond anything we've ever measured.
So the dome's getting ready for another growth spurt.
A massive one.
Define "massive."
Half the eastern coast of France, and if it keeps growing at this rate, in 120 years, the time dilation field will blanket the entire Earth.
120 years for us...
In here, but out there-- three weeks before the planet is torn apart.
This is ridiculous.
Agreed.
I mean, I didn't even work on that time dilation node we salvaged from Worth's warehouse.
Right.
Neither did you, by the way.
Right again.
And yet here we are trying to recreate it using pieces of old laptops, and-and-and iPods, and...
What is that?
Thermostat from a toaster.
I'm sorry I asked.
Look...
We know the epicenter of the original eruption.
Now, all subsequent growth radiated from there.
If I can nullify the time dilation field at that spot-- it would burst this bubble and return Carentan to normal time?
Come on, it can't be that simple.
Well, unfortunately, you're right.
However, we are lucky in that we have decades of research at our disposal.
I sense a "but" coming.
We are missing a key element, an element found in Worth's time node.
Cerrelium.
Okay, so where do we find that?
Hollow Earth.
Perfect.
Or...
From the time node that Henry dismantled.
At the Sanctuary?
Mm.
In case you've forgotten, we can't just reach out and touch someone.
You know, I've been thinking about that, and I may have a way.
You were right.
This is the ultimate slow-broadcast message.
It's no wonder the satellites couldn't pick up any movement in Carentan.
In real-world time, we're moving so fast, we're not even a blur.
We are invisible.
But this should get somebody's attention.
Look at him.
I remember the early days.
It wasn't easy.
Go, talk to him.
Evening.
May I sit down?
Sure, please.
So, how are you?
I'm okay.
You?
Every day a new bone creaks.
But it does get easier, you know.
I'm not sure I want it to.
When did you...
Give up?
I was going to say "surrender."
I can't recall a specific moment.
I guess it happened gradually, a day at a time.
Next thing I knew, one day had turned into decades.
And you don't miss the real world?
Of course I do, but I've got a family here now, a life.
So it wasn't just interference?
It was an extremely compressed radio signal.
From here?
From Carentan.
It's Magnus!
Number 37... 750 gauss.
Probably too much copper.
Yeah.
You know, I-I think I need another coil here.
Did I see one in the tool box?
Happy Birthday.
I can't believe you remembered.
Neither can I.
Can I open it?
Yeah, but I-I don't want you to get too excited, okay?
It's nothing much.
It's beautiful.
See, I think I screwed up the clasp--
Oh, be quiet.
See, I knew it.
I love it.
I'm glad you like it.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have--
No, no, no, no...
It's just complicated.
Abby.
Complicated.
Not for me.
But, see, you're...
And she's the past, and...
Dark time is coming.
If we make it through the famine years till sunrise...
I want to have a baby.
Hey, Magnus.
How's everything?
Great.
Yeah.
I'll go get us some lunch.
Anything you want to tell me?
No.
About the magnetic readings?
Oh, that.
Uh, yeah.
None of the metals that we smelted together have nearly enough gauss as cerrelium.
Damn.
Means we'll have to wait and hope that someone's seen the rock signal.
And what if they do?
I mean, that could take years in our time to get that node here, and even then, there's no guarantee that it's going to work.
No, there isn't.
Yeah.
Will--
No, look...
You're immortal, essentially, but I'm not.
I mean, has it ever occurred to you that we may not solve this problem in my lifetime?
Time dilation field?
Her message is irrefutable evidence they're still alive!
And they need help, so let's move!
Your colleagues took it upon themselves to break through the barrier.
Their fate is their own responsibility.
So, what the hell are you and your boys doing here, then?
'Cause you're certainly not helping anyone trapped in Carentan.
There is a plan.
It's in motion.
Oh, yeah, right.
Hey, this satellite feed...
How long has this been here?
A few minutes ago.
It suddenly appeared.
That's an elemental symbol.
Not according to my science guys.
No element on earth like that.
True.
It's the symbol for cerrelium.
An element found...
Elsewhere.
All personnel.
Project Greenhouse is a go.
T-minus 37 minutes.
Mark.
This is a message from Magnus and Will.
What does it mean?
Uh, it's hard to explain, but give us time.
Time, you don't have.
The field is expanding.
My job is to stop it.
Project Greenhouse.
It's an air strike.
They're going to blow Carentan off the map.
there's no way we're going to beat the air strike.
Does it have to be cerrelium?
There must be something else we can substitute.
I don't know...
Okay, Biggie, remember last week when you were making that bouillabaisse, and you ran out of saffron, so you used turmeric instead, and it tasted just as good.
Did not.
You get my point.
All right, let's give it a shot.
What do you got in your kitchen over there?
Should be just up ahead.
By the way, Will,
Happy New Year.
Somehow I don't feel like celebrating.
You see that sky?
Sunset's beginning.
45 days until nightfall.
The solar panels will go dead, we'll lose power to the lab.
Which is why we're testing this node now.
Here we are, the epicenter of the original disturbance.
You know, without the cerrelium...
I agree, and if time weren't forcing my hand, I'd wait, but what choice do we have?
Say a prayer.
Turn it off!
Bloody hell!
Ravi?
Ravi!
Your experiment, my God.
What happened?
People disappeared.
What do you mean?
Everything went very fast, then slow, and then they were gone.
Just vanished?
I saw one of them with my own eyes.
Andre.
He was re-sheeting one of the solar panels.
He fell, but vanished before he hit the ground.
Magnus, what have we done?
Four people were vaporized because our experiment failed.
What if it didn't fail?
What if, for a few seconds, we managed to diffuse the time dilation field?
Well, then why did those people disappear?
Because when Carentan resets itself to real world time, they don't exist.
In your time, they haven't been born yet.
Okay, okay, so...
If we get the cerrelium, stabilize the node, make it work properly...
Then anything inside this dome that was created after its inception, equipment, animals, people, will cease to exist.
And the only people who'll survive the reset...
The three of us.
Everybody else...
No!
No...
Josie...
Josie, wait!
Josie, wait!
Hey, stop!
Look at me!
We didn't know!
We didn't know.
We didn't know.
But now you do.
So are you going to continue your experiments, even though we would all just...
How could you just...
Disappear me?
Oh, beauty.
It's not going to be easy walking a surface-to-air missile past these guys.
We don't need the whole missile.
The alloy Biggie mentioned is the thruster stage.
It's part of the heat shield.
Uh, I don't suppose you have a screwdriver?
Penknife?
Yeah.
Here.
Oh, come to mama...
Okay.
You're going to need this.
Thanks.
Hold your fire!
What the hell was that all about?
It's not cerrelium, but I was able to use parts of the missile they sent.
How's it going?
As usual, slower than I'd like.
Hopefully this new shielding will do the trick.
One more stunt like that, and the next bullet goes in your head.
To hell with you!
There are people alive in there!
There's still a chance to save them!
Not in the next nine minutes.
The birds are already in the air.
Let's go.
I don't hate you.
If the dome continues to spread, continents shifting at lightning speed...
Oceans born in the blink of an eye...
The stress on the Earth's core will rip this planet apart.
I understand all that.
Like you, I'm a scientist, but I'm also a husband.
The sun has almost set.
Are you ready?
Can I really be doing this?
Please, dear,
I can't talk about this anymore.
If our small sacrifice can save billions of people...
You were always the stronger one.
Whenever the children got sick,
I would worry so much, but you-- we will never leave you, I promise.
If you don't see us here, look here.
That's where we will be.
Always.
Now, go, my love.
It's time for you to be the strong one.
The shielding is as secure as it'll ever be.
It's been a long time, not a good time.
I just wish I knew how to say goodbye.
It's Ravi!
There's a crowd in the street.
I told them that you'd come out and speak with them.
They're watching the front of the mayor's office.
All right, we'll go through the basement and out the back.
I don't know how long I can hold them.
Every second counts.
Thank you.
Just listen to us!
The time dilation field's a massive concentration of energy.
You hit that sucker with a bomb, and there is no telling what the fallout will be!
You still don't get it, do you?
The train has left the station.
Whatever happens, it's all going to be over in 60 seconds.
Magnus!
Will!
What is it?
You've got to hurry.
I couldn't hold them.
They have found out where you are.
Stop!
Stop!
Josie...
Josie, don't do this.
Helen, get away from that machine.
Please.
Who the hell are you to say who lives and who dies?
Josie!
No!
We made it.
Ravi didn't.
Anyone else?
After the reset, we were found in the field.
Kate said something about a...
An air strike that was called off at the last second, but I was still pretty groggy.
I could have dreamt that.
They had a million questions, but I told them to let you sleep.
Thank you...
But now we need to get to work.
Something, or someone, is behind what happened in Carentan.
I feel it in my gut.
You're not blaming yourself, are you?
Until I know differently.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Previously on Sanctuary...
It's your fault, Normandy 1944,
Allied invasion.
You were on French soil when it happened.
[Machine gun fire]
[Zimmerman]:
Carentan?
[Jeanette]:
Carentan is a very bad place.
Why don't we just attack this weather device?
[Magnus]:
If we simply blow it up, the creature they're using to power it could do massive damage.
There's no way to really kill a fire elemental.
Is there a way that you can force down?
[Air whooshing]
I appreciate it, Ravi, thank you.
I need you to visit the Mumbai Sanctuary.
Ravi is the head of house.
Dr. Zimmerman,
Ms. Freelander, namaste.
Call me Ravi.
[Will]:
He pretty much saved my life, twice.
Will!
What happened?
Unbelievable!
[Magnus]:
Did you say Carentan?
In Normandy?
Yeah, I thought it might ring a bell.
It does indeed.
How many are missing?
Well, it's hard to say exactly.
There's a media blackout, and my usual sources are strangely silent.
You have the partial list there.
Yeah, uh, a local farmer...
And his livestock.
A couple of backpacking tourists, and a busload of senior citizens.
All disappeared without a trace within a ten-kilometer radius of Carentan.
And no word from any of the residents?
No response to phone calls or emails, not even from the local police, and did you see that sat-link I sent you?
Yeah, I'm calling it up now.
Censored?
By whom?
There's the rub.
And Ravi went in five days ago?
He was already in Paris wrapping up the Bipedal Conference, so I figured--
No, absolutely, you made the right call.
I discovered he was sending a video log back to his computer at the Mumbai Sanctuary.
I called up his last post.
Take a look at this.
[Ravi]:
I'm inside the first checkpoint now, and I think I'm getting closer to the perimeter of the disturbance.
According to my estimates, it's within...
I'm feeling a strange tingling sensation--
[Declan]:
Since then, nothing.
All contact was instantly lost.
It was like he disappeared off the face of the planet.
♪ Sanctuary 3x18 ♪ Carentan Original Air Date on June 6, 2011

♪ ♪
Bastards!
That answers my question.
The French government, now Interpol.
Complete stonewall.
I know the feeling.
C.I.A.?
Schtum .
MI-6?
Waiting for a call back.
I've got a bridge I want to sell you.
Precisely.
Are you getting the feeling we've been kicked out of the treehouse here?
It's like all our reciprocal agreements have been rescinded overnight.
Which means whatever's happening in Carentan must be terrifying the hell out of them.
[Sighs]
I've just come from the regional Magistrate's office.
Like blood from a stone, and apparently the Surete now wants me to leave the country within 12 hours, which, of course, only makes me more determined to stay.
I'm inside the first checkpoint now, and I think I'm getting closer to the perimeter of the disturbance.
According to my estimates, it's within...
I'm feeling a strange tingling sensation--
Any abnormal you heard of discharge energy like that?
Several, but they leave radiation signatures in the atmosphere, and we don't have any spikes in that area.
Gulfstream's on standby.
You ready?
Almost.
This would go a lot faster with Hank's help, by the way, but apparently they don't have phones in sweat lodges.
That's the last time we give him the weekend off to commune with his inner wolf.
[Chuckling]
Okay, so we used the background landscape from Ravi's video...
And the towers the cell signal bounced off...
To geo-map his last location, nice.
Exactly.
Oh, we got a hit.
Looks like a couple miles from the town center.
Okay, so if Ravi did find a way in, that would be our access point.
Stay sharp.
...And have the TAC team standing by, just in case.
They're ready and waiting at Plymouth Naval Base.
It's just a 30-minute hop across the channel, if need be.
Good.
I'm leaving now.
I'll meet you there.
Ah...
Do you think that's wise?
We're already down one Sanctuary head.
Until I know what we're dealing with--
I was the one who sent Ravi in there.
I'm responsible.
So with all due respect, Guv, I'll see you at De Gaulle.
[Phone link beeps off]
Cheeky bugger.
So, 65 years later...
Look a little different without the barbed wire and swastikas?
Ever so slightly.
Heads up.
What's the situation here?
Industrial spill.
We're asking everybody to turn back.
But I believe one of my colleagues--
Sorry, ma'am, until clean-up is complete, the area is off-limits.
[Kate groans]
Oh, bumpy roads...
You're not going to get carsick again?
She's been very, very sick.
Oh, God...
She's been really sick.
[Retching]
[Blows thud]
Nicely done.
Arretez!
Who's in charge here?
I am.
Dr. Magnus...
Inside.
Just you.
You know who I am.
Let's just say your reputation precedes you.
Wish I could say the same about you.
I don't have a name, not as far as you're concerned.
Right, then.
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?
This Hazmat dog-and-pony show is a joke.
If there was a real radiation risk, you and your boys would be suited up.
Atmospherics from the area came back clean as a whistle.
No large industries for over a hundred kilometers.
Oh, and, by the way, you've got at least two trucks outside full of surface-to-air missiles.
Starstreaks , if I'm not mistaken.
Now, I had no idea they could be used to clean up a toxic spill.
You know the only reason you're still alive is because of who you are?
And I'm not leaving until I get some answers.
Now, one of my colleagues--
Ravi Ganapathiraman?
Have you seen him?
Six days ago.
Like you, he was stopped at our first checkpoint, and he was ordered to turn back.
But he didn't.
Is he alive?
Take your people, leave.
Now.
You know who I am, therefore you know what I do.
Whatever's going on here, maybe I can help.
This is above your pay grade, doctor.
Yeah, even you.
Well, whoever he is, he's clearly ex-military.
He's not French army.
Yeah, generic uniforms, no markings on the vehicles.
Some sort of private international security force.
Yet he's clearly acting with the approval of the French government, and yet his mandate's being rigorously shielded by intelligence agencies worldwide.
Well, something very big and very bad is going on inside that town.
Something no government wants to take responsibility for.
And yet all governments want to cover up.
That field, those trees.
Pull over.
I wonder if it's still there.
A tunnel from the war.
It leads under the field, and if memory serves, should end beyond the base camp.
Looks like somebody used it recently.
It must be how Ravi bypassed perimeter security.
Well, how did he know about it?
Well, it's in my old logs.
It could've come up if he did a Carentan search.
Now, you two, until we know what we're dealing with,
I'm not willing to endanger the entire team.
Aw, come on.
I could argue there's strength in numbers.
I'm sure you could, but not this time.
I guess I'll go first.
Don't even think about following.
[Grunting with effort]
Check our coordinates.
Yeah.
Okay, GPS says we're now behind enemy lines.
The perimeter camp is back that way.
Shh!
Listen.
It's so quiet.
Exactly.
Not even any birds.
The town's that way, beyond the treeline.
[Sizzling hum]
What the hell just happened?
[Forest alive with bird and insect song]
Do you hear it?
Yeah.
Hey.
Hello.
Anglais.
[In French accent]:
Newcomers.
You were right.
You from Carentan?
Oui.
Come with us.
The last one will be very excited to meet you.
[Woman giggles merrily]
[Crowd murmuring excitedly in French and English]
Check it out, the whole town's gone green.
It's not quite as I remember it.
I'm not sure what I expected, but it certainly wasn't this.
I don't understand.
Something's not right.
Here he is.
The last one.
Helen, Will...
Ravi!
Helen, even though it's only been six days for you,
I'm now 74 years old.
My mind says it's not possible, and yet...
I look at you.
Um, I'm sorry, Ravi.
My brain is still playing catch-up here.
You say that you arrived in Carentan six days ago?
In your time.
But in this village, 40 years has passed.
In "dome-time,"
or at least, that's what I call it.
It's a massive time dilation field, and you can't leave?
Anyone who tries to pass through the boundary and re-enter the normal time stream is killed instantly.
There's an intense dimensional recoil.
It's like being hit by a train.
So we're trapped inside an invisible time dome...
In France.
Awkward, but it does explain a lot.
Oh, yeah, it makes complete sense.
Come with me.
There's someone I want you to meet.
Anna!
Newcomers.
Welcome.
Helen, Will, this is my wife, Anna.
This used to be an old Nazi bunker.
Fond memories.
Of course.
But as I was saying, the time stream first erupted just over three weeks ago your time.
The epicenter was in a cave off the cliffs.
That's when the disappearances started.
The French government thought they had a Bermuda Triangle on their hands, so at first they sent in scientists.
Who never returned.
Then they sent in the military, who also never returned, and then, no one.
Until you...
The last one.
The rest, as they say, is history.
Literally.
So all this equipment...
Was already here, or brought in since.
Previous experiments?
The result of over 100 years of research by top scientists in France and the military, trying to understand the time stream, trying to solve it, dissolve it, and yet...
Here we are.
God, I can't believe it.
What?
I destroyed a massive fire elemental back in 1944.
Drove it into the Earth less than half a mile from here, and now this?
You don't think this is your fault?
Well, it can't be a coincidence.
I have to admit, the thought did occur to me, but I haven't been able to find a connection.
Anna told me we had newcomers.
Josie, Helen, Will.
Josie is the granddaughter of the first French scientist to enter Carentan.
An excellent assistant.
She's also a natural at mathematics.
I also make sure he does not forget to eat his lunch.
[Ravi laughs]
Of course.
Let's go, Anna hates it when I'm late.
So easy to lose track of time when there's three years of daylight.
So one day of our time is equal to six years inside Carentan.
Three years of daylight, followed by three years of night.
The dark time.
Your 12-hour cycle translated into our years.
We're cut off, remember, from the outside world, so we have to stockpile all our resources.
Food from the harvests.
Energy from the solar panels, but it is never enough.
The stores of energy are the first to go.
Then the food runs out.
The last few months...
Only the youngest and the strongest make it through to the sunrise.
How long until the next dark time?
Nine months, in dome time.
But out there...
Less than three hours.
What if they don't come back?
They will.
Yeah, but what if they don't?
Then we'll go in after them.
What if we don't come back?
Well, then at least we'll be in there.
[Groans in frustration]
This is pointless.
You heard Magnus.
Yeah, she said "don't go in the tunnel."
Right.
But that doesn't mean we're supposed to sit around with our thumb up--
What is your point?
My point is, we're learning nothing here.
Let's go.
Freeze!
Stay right there.
Aw, crap...
Your colleagues did a very stupid thing.
They may be lost forever.
Look, you know what's going on, so just tell us.
Maybe he doesn't know.
Maybe no one knows what's happening in Carentan.
Impound their vehicle, put them in the supply tent.
Sir.
Let's go.
Some of this handwriting is practically indecipherable.
A combination of poor penmanship and homemade inks.
French, German, English.
Was none of this research computerized?
At first, but then they realized how risky that was.
Hard drives weren't built to last 150 years.
[Sighs heavily]
I barely feel like I've made a dent at all.
You've only been at it a week.
Give yourself time.
Time...
Time dilation.
Adam Worth and the time nodes.
Yet this can't have been his doing.
He died months ago in Hollow Earth.
In all my years here,
I've explored every square inch of the boundary.
There's no device anywhere.
Do you never feel like giving up?
Just quitting?
Every day.
What keeps you going?
You.
I wanted to see the look on your face when I cracked this mother.
[Laughs]
Well, let's get to it, then, shall we?
[Device clicking]
You take these readings every week?
The dome's like a living thing.
We're taking its pulse.
Looking for a weakening in the energy.
Have you ever found any?
If it's so dangerous to penetrate the dome, yet you can't see it, how do you...
Careful, now, we are close.
Slowly.
[Chuckles in wonder]
Yeah, I-I feel it.
It's like my skin is tingling.
If we kept walking, it would intensify.
Let me show you.
Another three meters, and...
I saw it happen once.
A young man, just before dark time.
He started screaming and ran, and ran, and just...
Blew apart.
Hey...
Don't think about that.
There's gotta be another way out, right?
What?
It's just, I was born here.
This is the only world I have ever known.
There's a hell of a lot more world outside of Carentan.
You're gonna love it.
Thanks.
Nice bathrooms you got there.
Just keep moving.
You know, it was real sweet of you to wait for me.
Get inside.
Okay.
Of course I trust you.
It's just that there are only two functioning motherboards left.
I can't give any guarantees.
But it is a chance to communicate with the outside world.
And on a frequency we know will be monitored.
But previous transmissions have never been answered.
That's because of the time differential.
When a signal broadcast from inside the dome is received on the outside, it's incredibly condensed.
We're talking hundredths of a nanosecond.
It would barely register on the most sensitive equipment.
Which is why I'm stretching out this signal, slowing it down.
Even a simple message like, "we are alive.
Time dilation field."
Will take up two weeks to transmit.
And we're going to need uninterrupted power.
I've dedicated one of the solar panels.
All set, then.
[Frequency wavering]
I know they've only been gone half an hour, but this whole set-up gives me the creeps.
Yeah, me too.
I've got your location now.
Also, there's a strong satellite transmission coming from the same area.
The command tent.
Can you eavesdrop?
Signal's scrambled.
No surprise.
One more thing.
Just before your call came in, I picked up something odd.
Specifically?
Short bursts of static, like screeching white noise.
Interference?
Yeah, could be.
I'll look into it.
[Pounding calculator buttons]
Ravi's asking that the solar panels be re-routed back to the battery stores.
Uh-huh.
You know, it's been three weeks since our S.O.S. call.
Yes, I know.
If the outside hasn't responded by now--
I'm fully aware of the situation, thank you.
Is there something I can help you with?
Yeah, I could really use a computer, or a proper pen and paper!
God, even a bloody slide-rule!
I'm sorry, Will.
These energy readings from the boundary?
Over a century's worth.
Do you know that when this time dilation field first came into existence, it was the size of a city block?
And now it's over 12 kilometers in diameter.
And every few decades, the pressure builds, like before an earthquake.
And when it breaks apart, the dome grows.
We know this.
But what we didn't know was that it was happening exponentially.
The energy readings from the past 20 years are climbing steadily, beyond anything we've ever measured.
So the dome's getting ready for another growth spurt.
A massive one.
Define "massive."
Half the eastern coast of France, and if it keeps growing at this rate, in 120 years, the time dilation field will blanket the entire Earth.
120 years for us...
In here, but out there-- three weeks before the planet is torn apart.
This is ridiculous.
Agreed.
I mean, I didn't even work on that time dilation node we salvaged from Worth's warehouse.
Right.
Neither did you, by the way.
Right again.
And yet here we are trying to recreate it using pieces of old laptops, and-and-and iPods, and...
What is that?
Thermostat from a toaster.
[Scoffs] I'm sorry I asked.
[Sighs heavily]
Look...
We know the epicenter of the original eruption.
Now, all subsequent growth radiated from there.
If I can nullify the time dilation field at that spot-- it would burst this bubble and return Carentan to normal time?
Come on, it can't be that simple.
Well, unfortunately, you're right.
However, we are lucky in that we have decades of research at our disposal.
I sense a "but" coming.
We are missing a key element, an element found in Worth's time node.
Cerrelium.
Okay, so where do we find that?
Hollow Earth.
[Laughs wryly] Perfect.
Or...
From the time node that Henry dismantled.
At the Sanctuary?
Mm.
In case you've forgotten, we can't just reach out and touch someone.
You know, I've been thinking about that, and I may have a way.
You were right.
This is the ultimate slow-broadcast message.
It's no wonder the satellites couldn't pick up any movement in Carentan.
In real-world time, we're moving so fast, we're not even a blur.
We are invisible.
But this should get somebody's attention.
Look at him.
I remember the early days.
It wasn't easy.
Go, talk to him.
Evening.
May I sit down?
Sure, please.
So, how are you?
I'm okay.
You?
Every day a new bone creaks.
But it does get easier, you know.
I'm not sure I want it to.
When did you...
Give up?
I was going to say "surrender."
[Chuckles]
I can't recall a specific moment.
I guess it happened gradually, a day at a time.
Next thing I knew, one day had turned into decades.
And you don't miss the real world?
Of course I do, but I've got a family here now, a life.
[Kate]:
So it wasn't just interference?
It was an extremely compressed radio signal.
From here?
From Carentan.
It's Magnus!
Number 37... 750 gauss.
Probably too much copper.
Yeah.
You know, I-I think I need another coil here.
Did I see one in the tool box?
Happy Birthday.
I can't believe you remembered.
Neither can I.
Can I open it?
Yeah, but I-I don't want you to get too excited, okay?
It's nothing much.
It's beautiful.
See, I think I screwed up the clasp--
Oh, be quiet.
See, I knew it.
I love it.
I'm glad you like it.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have--
No, no, no, no...
It's just complicated.
Abby.
Complicated.
Not for me.
But, see, you're...
And she's the past, and...
Dark time is coming.
If we make it through the famine years till sunrise...
I want to have a baby.
Hey, Magnus.
How's everything?
Great.
Yeah.
I'll go get us some lunch.
Anything you want to tell me?
No.
About the magnetic readings?
Oh, that.
Uh, yeah.
[Clears throat awkwardly]
None of the metals that we smelted together have nearly enough gauss as cerrelium.
Damn.
Means we'll have to wait and hope that someone's seen the rock signal.
And what if they do?
I mean, that could take years in our time to get that node here, and even then, there's no guarantee that it's going to work.
No, there isn't.
Yeah.
Will--
No, look...
You're immortal, essentially, but I'm not.
I mean, has it ever occurred to you that we may not solve this problem in my lifetime?
Time dilation field?
Her message is irrefutable evidence they're still alive!
And they need help, so let's move!
Your colleagues took it upon themselves to break through the barrier.
Their fate is their own responsibility.
So, what the hell are you and your boys doing here, then?
'Cause you're certainly not helping anyone trapped in Carentan.
There is a plan.
It's in motion.
Oh, yeah, right.
Hey, this satellite feed...
How long has this been here?
A few minutes ago.
It suddenly appeared.
That's an elemental symbol.
Not according to my science guys.
No element on earth like that.
True.
It's the symbol for cerrelium.
An element found...
Elsewhere.
All personnel.
Project Greenhouse is a go.
T-minus 37 minutes.
Mark.
This is a message from Magnus and Will.
What does it mean?
Uh, it's hard to explain, but give us time.
Time, you don't have.
The field is expanding.
My job is to stop it.
Project Greenhouse.
It's an air strike.
They're going to blow Carentan off the map.
[Kate]:
Even if you put the time node piecesonaplanerightnow--
There's no way we're going to beat the air strike.
Does it have to be cerrelium?
There must be something else we can substitute.
I don't know...
Okay, Biggie, remember last week when you were making that bouillabaisse, and you ran out of saffron, so you used turmeric instead, and it tasted just as good.
Did not.
You get my point.
All right, let's give it a shot.
What do you got in your kitchen over there?
Should be just up ahead.
By the way, Will,
Happy New Year.
Somehow I don't feel like celebrating.
You see that sky?
Sunset's beginning.
45 days until nightfall.
The solar panels will go dead, we'll lose power to the lab.
Which is why we're testing this node now.
Here we are, the epicenter of the original disturbance.
You know, without the cerrelium...
I agree, and if time weren't forcing my hand, I'd wait, but what choice do we have?
Say a prayer.
[Device whirring]
[Humming grows loud, wind starts to blow]
[Voice phasing and echoing] Turn it off!
Bloody hell!
[Crowd murmuring in concern]
Ravi?
Ravi!
Your experiment, my God.
What happened?
People disappeared.
What do you mean?
Everything went very fast, then slow, and then they were gone.
Just vanished?
I saw one of them with my own eyes.
Andre.
He was re-sheeting one of the solar panels.
He fell, but vanished before he hit the ground.
Magnus, what have we done?
Four people were vaporized because our experiment failed.
What if it didn't fail?
What if, for a few seconds, we managed to diffuse the time dilation field?
Well, then why did those people disappear?
Because when Carentan resets itself to real world time, they don't exist.
In your time, they haven't been born yet.
Okay, okay, so...
If we get the cerrelium, stabilize the node, make it work properly...
Then anything inside this dome that was created after its inception, equipment, animals, people, will cease to exist.
And the only people who'll survive the reset...
The three of us.
Everybody else...
[Josie]:
No!
No...
Josie...
Josie, wait!
Josie, wait!
Hey, stop!
Look at me!
We didn't know!
We didn't know.
We didn't know.
But now you do.
So are you going to continue your experiments, even though we would all just...
How could you just...
Disappear me?
Oh, beauty.
[Declan]:
It's not going to be easy walking a surface-to-air missile past these guys.
We don't need the whole missile.
The alloy Biggie mentioned is the thruster stage.
It's part of the heat shield.
Uh, I don't suppose you have a screwdriver?
Penknife?
Yeah.
Here.
Oh, come to mama...
Okay.
You're going to need this.
Thanks.
[Starts engine]
Hold your fire!
What the hell was that all about?
It's not cerrelium, but I was able to use parts of the missile they sent.
How's it going?
As usual, slower than I'd like.
Hopefully this new shielding will do the trick.
One more stunt like that, and the next bullet goes in your head.
To hell with you!
There are people alive in there!
There's still a chance to save them!
Not in the next nine minutes.
The birds are already in the air.
Let's go.
I don't hate you.
If the dome continues to spread, continents shifting at lightning speed...
Oceans born in the blink of an eye...
The stress on the Earth's core will rip this planet apart.
I understand all that.
Like you, I'm a scientist, but I'm also a husband.
The sun has almost set.
Are you ready?
Can I really be doing this?
Please, dear,
I can't talk about this anymore.
If our small sacrifice can save billions of people...
You were always the stronger one.
Whenever the children got sick,
I would worry so much, but you-- we will never leave you, I promise.
If you don't see us here, look here.
That's where we will be.
Always.
Now, go, my love.
It's time for you to be the strong one.
The shielding is as secure as it'll ever be.
It's been a long time, not a good time.
I just wish I knew how to say goodbye.
[Banging on door]
It's Ravi!
There's a crowd in the street.
I told them that you'd come out and speak with them.
They're watching the front of the mayor's office.
All right, we'll go through the basement and out the back.
I don't know how long I can hold them.
Every second counts.
Thank you.
[Crowd shouting angrily outside]
Just listen to us!
The time dilation field's a massive concentration of energy.
You hit that sucker with a bomb, and there is no telling what the fallout will be!
You still don't get it, do you?
The train has left the station.
Whatever happens, it's all going to be over in 60 seconds.
Magnus!
Will!
What is it?
You've got to hurry.
I couldn't hold them.
They have found out where you are.
Stop!
Stop!
Josie...
Josie, don't do this.
Helen, get away from that machine.
Please.
Who the hell are you to say who lives and who dies?
[Device hums to life]
Josie!
No!
[Gun fires]
[Sounds slow dreamily]
[Thud]
[Medical monitors beep steadily]
[Announcements in French sound over P.A. system]
We made it.
Ravi didn't.
Anyone else?
[Groans groggily]
After the reset, we were found in the field.
Kate said something about a...
An air strike that was called off at the last second, but I was still pretty groggy.
I could have dreamt that.
They had a million questions, but I told them to let you sleep.
Thank you...
But now we need to get to work.
Something, or someone, is behind what happened in Carentan.
I feel it in my gut.
You're not blaming yourself, are you?
Until I know differently.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Stephanie's in at Her Majesty's pleasure.
Take care of the business for a few days.
Yeah.
It's ã250 an hour.
I'm not a madam.
Just helping out an old friend.
I need some new supplies.
Whips, handcuffs.
I'll get you a list.
So, you are a fucking whore?
That's enough.
Hannah's gone out of her way to look after you.
Thank you.
What for?
Standing up for me.
Our other relationships, they're fine.
But they're not real.
You can do anything you want.
I've never lied to Ben.
Hannah, I'm really worried about you now, so, just call me when you get this, please.
Maybe we should just try and be like good friends.
You'd best go home, Belle.
This isn't you, Hannah.
Just kiss me, Ben, please.
Are you OK?
In life, our past always catches up with us.
And we have to ask ourselves what we really want.
After all, every decision has consequences.
And there's always a day of reckoning.
Secret Diary of a Call Girl Season 4, Episode 8
I don't know why, but I've always found courtrooms sexy.
Maybe it's the outfits.
Maybe it's that...that building sense of jeopardy.
We, the jury, find the defendant, Stephanie Charlton...
Or maybe...maybe it's something else.
..guilty.
The deal was, you promised you'd get her off.
Exciting, isn't it?
Well, no, not really.
I only agreed to take over for a few weeks.
Trust me.
This one's completely under control.
She has no history of any previous convictions.
And indeed, has spent a lengthy period in custody awaiting trial.
And I see no reason to detain her further.
Miss Charlton, you're free to go.
You bad...
Yes.
..bad...
Yes.
..bad judge!
Yes!
Yes!
Stephanie...
Stephanie.
Congratulations.
Some jailbirds' wings just can never be clipped.
I'm having a little party tonight.
For you.
Me?
Just my way of saying thank you for everything you've done.
You didn't have to.
Never let it be said I don't repay my debts.
Oh, yes.
See you tonight.
Oh, shit.
So, this is Ben.
Yeah.
Ben, this is Harry.
Shall we get going?
He says you two have worked together.
Yeah, we...sort of,
I mean, it was...a long time ago.
She helped me out on some police business.
Yeah.
Nothing untoward.
She was very professional at all times.
Well, I'll leave you to it.
All right.
Very nice to meet you.
Belle.
Always a pleasure.
What was that all about?
Nothing.
Do you want some lunch?
Who was that guy?
I told you, he's a friend of Stephanie's.
Come on.
There's this really good place just down the road.
I've got to go to work.
Ben, will you just stop, please?
Look, I know things have been difficult lately, OK, but...
Stephanie's out now, and things can just go back to normal.
Normal?
A few days ago, you leave a freaked-out message on my phone, disappear for hours, I still don't know what happened.
What's it going to be next week?
It's my job, Ben.
I'm not sure how much more I can take.
Oh, come on.
Other people know where their girlfriends are at night.
What do you want me to do?
Shall I just give up my job?
Why should I give up my job?
I love my job.
My job is who I am.
You know, maybe I was right all along.
No man can handle what I do.
I can handle it.
What are you doing here?
Declaring my allegiance.
This really isn't a good time.
So, this is Hannah.
Wow.
Moving up in the world, Hannah.
Very cosy.
Very chic.
I have to go to work in a minute, Harry.
Not very you, though, is it?
I mean, you're not the stay-at-home type.
I have a boyfriend.
Ben is my boyfriend.
Yes.
He's a boy.
What you need is a man.
Ben is a man.
Really?
Yeah.
He looks more like a skinny kid to me.
He's actually one of the kindest and... funniest, most decent people -
Yeah, but he doesn't excite you.
Doesn't get under your skin.
Not like I do.
I've got to go to work.
Fine.
Whatever you say.
But I know who you are, Belle.
And right now, you're trying to be something you're not.
I'm not trying to be someone I'm not.
I know exactly who I am, and exactly what I'm doing.
At home and in work, I'm totally in control.
Ooh!
You must be Belle.
Yeah.
Sorry.
You're Lewis, right?
Right.
I just got my heel caught.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Come in.
So, Lewis, what can I do for you today?
Whatever you want.
No, I believe the deal here is... ..whatever you want.
I don't know what I want.
Come on.
There must be something.
You can tell me.
Nothing too naughty.
No fantasies?
I like to be tested.
I like it to be hard.
Oh!
Oh, God.
I'm sorry, I...
I didn't realise.
I can't believe I just did that.
No, no.
It's OK.
Don't worry.
That hasn't happened to me since sixth from, I swear.
Oh, fuck!
Oh!
Fuck!
I knew it.
Oh...
I know exactly who you are.
You're Hannah Baxter from school.
Cheers.
Cheers.
That's horrible.
So, advertising.
Well...
At least I'm an honest prostitute.
What can I say?
I've got a gift.
I can make even Hoovers seem sexy.
What about you?
No, I think I draw the line at Hoovers.
No, I meant, you could have done anything.
Why choose this?
The same reason you're in advertising, probably.
I mean...
I'm good at it.
I think, and um...
I just...
I enjoy it.
I like getting to know clients.
I like finding out their secrets.
I'm not really a virgin.
I was the animal guy at college.
The last time I had a girlfriend, I was 17.
Kind of like, a private detective.
Or a priest...ish, with just, like, better underwear.
Just loads and loads of sex.
Is it really that simple?
Well, no, I never said it was simple.
I'm going out with, I fall in love with her, and I walk in and she's fucking some guy.
You sleep with other men.
It's my job!
It's what I do.
It's different.
When are you going to get it?
There is no Belle and there is no Hannah.
It's just you who doesn't know what you want.
Even though you had braces and huge teeth, and you were a bit chubby in school...
I always had the biggest crush on you.
Chubby?
Wow.
That's nice.
Sorry.
It's OK.
Shall we have another round?
Yeah.
Cheers.
There's nothing like colliding with your past... to help you face your present.
What's going on?
I meant what I said.
I can't take this anymore.
Are you leaving?
When we were just mates, you told me everything.
About life, about work, no secrets.
Since we got together, it's like I don't know anything about you.
That's not true.
No?
How honest have we been with each other lately?
Things have been difficult, Ben.
I'm fine with what you do for a living.
I am.
What I can't deal with is what it's doing to us.
I don't trust you anymore.
Let's just talk about it.
I can't just change overnight.
Well, I won't go to Stephanie's tonight.
Please.
No, you go.
I'll meet you afterwards.
Well, when?
Midnight.
Our place on the Embankment.
If you think you're ready to give up being Belle, give you and me a shot at a decent future, you come and meet me.
And if not...
It's your decision, Han.
Who do you want to be?
In life, there is always a moment... ..when your future depends on a choice.
Hi.
Belle.
There's someone I want you to meet.
My new girlfriend.
Sylvia Burke.
Crown Prosecutor.
Best there is.
Hello.
Nice to meet you.
Have we met before?
I don't think so, but I've heard a lot about you.
Caught me by the balls in the courtroom and the bedroom.
Fucking exhilarating.
That's wonderful news, Liam.
Well done.
You look sensational.
I need to talk to you.
Very important.
I can't do this right now, Harry.
Sorry.
Charlie, you look...
Thank you.
This is Marius.
Don't speak to him.
Gosh, you never stop, do you?
Marius is not a client.
Marius is my husband.
Oh.
Come along, Marius.
Time for your walk.
Belle.
Hi.
So, you understand, there was no-one else I could have trusted the business with?
You're a natural.
Oh, I don't know.
No, you are.
You were born for it.
It's in the veins.
Do you mind if I step in?
Be my guest.
Shall we?
You can't run away from me forever, you know.
I shouldn't be doing this.
Is this what you know you want?
I know what I want.
You.
Harry.
Be with me.
Why me?
I mean, you know, there's a big city out there full of gorgeous women.
Come on.
But there's only one you.
When I'm with you,
I feel alive.
And so do you.
I can't be with you, Harry.
Why?
Why not?
What are you doing instead?
You're never going to make Ben happy.
You are not that type of girl.
Think about it, Belle.
Me and you, we could go anywhere, we could do anything.
Think about the adventure.
Think about all the things we could get to explore.
I don't want you to give up your life.
I just want to have you in mine.
I have to go.
Come back.
I can't.
I have to go.
Is this it?
This is it, is it?
You're not coming.
I love you, Ben.
You're my best friend.
And you deserve the best life.
But it's not with me.
I can't give you what you need and I can't change who I am.
I don't want you to change who you are.
You deserve so much better than that.
You deserve the best.
You know this is the end, Hannah, yeah?
We can't go back from this.

Some choices we make for ourselves in life.

Not because we don't love them, but because we do.
The only way we know it's right is if it lets us stay true to ourselves.
But we can't regret our choices.
The past is behind us.
All we have is the present.

Arrh!
Arrh!
Toast her face.
Cut.
But now I'm back.
Now that I am back... you'll want me back.
You'll want me back.
Is that in the script?
Sorry.
Stephanie's spending a little time at Her Majesty's Pleasure.
I need you to take care of the business for a few days.
Yeah, it's 250 an hour.
I'm not a madam.
Just helping out an old friend.
I need some new supplies - whips, handcuffs.
I'll get you a list.
So you are a fucking whore, That's enough,
Hannah's gone out of her way to look after you.
- Thank you.
- What for?
Standing up for me.
Our other relationships, they're fine, but they're not real.
You can.
You can do anything you want.
I've never lied to Ben.
Hannah, I'm really worried about you now,
So just call me when you get this, please.
Maybe we should just try and do that good friends thing.
You best go home, Belle.
This isn't you, Hannah,
Just kiss me, Ben, please.
(Ben) Are you OK?
(Moaning)
In life, our past always catches up with us,
And we have to ask ourselves what we really want.
(Gasps)
(Ticking)
After all, every decision has consequences... and there's always a day of reckoning,
(Tick)
I don't know why, but I've always found court rooms sexy.
Maybe it's the outfits.
Maybe it's that...
that building sense of jeopardy.
(Gavel banging)
(Man) We, the jury, find the defendant Stephanie Charlton...
Or maybe... maybe it's something else.
(Moaning)
- (Man) ...guilty, - (She moans)
- (Man) ...guilty.
- (People gasping)
This was not the deal, Liam.
You promised you'd get Stephanie off.
- Exciting, isn't it?
- Well, no' not really.
I only agreed to take over the business for a few weeks.
Trust me - this one's completely under control.
She has no history of any previous convictions and indeed has spent a lengthy period in custody awaiting trial,
and I see no reason to detain her further.
Ms Charlton, you're free to go.
- You bad, bad...
- Yes!
Yes!
- ...bad judge.
- Yes!
Yeees!
Stephanie.
Stephanie.
Congratulations.
Some jailbirds, wings just can never be clipped.
- (Chuckles)
- I'm having a little party tonight...
- for you.
- For me?
It's just my way of saying thank you
- for everything you've done.
- You didn't have to do that!
Never let it be said I don't repay my debts.
Oh, yes.
(Chuckles) See you tonight.
Oh, shit.
- So this is Ben.
- Yeah.
- Ben, this is Harry.
Shall we get going?
- He says you two have worked together.
Yeah.
I mean, yeah...sort of.
I mean, it was a long time ago.
She helped me out on some police business.
- Yep.
- Nothing untoward.
- She was very professional at all times.
- (Belle) Hm.
- Well, I'll leave you to it.
- All right.
Very nice to meet you.
Belle.
Always a pleasure.
What was that all about?
Nothing.
Shall we get some lunch?
- Who was that guy, Hannah?
- I told you.
He's a friend of Stephanie's.
Come on, there's this really good place, just down the road.
I've got to go to work.
Ben, will you just stop.
Please.
Look, I know things have been difficult lately, OK, but Stephanie's out now, and things can just go back to normal.
Normal?
(Chuckles)
A few days ago you leave a freaked-out message on my phone, disappear for hours.
I still don't know what happened.
- What's it going to be next week?
- It's my job, Ben.
I'm not sure how much more of it I can take.
Oh, God, come on.
Come on, what?
Other people know where their girlfriends are at night.
What do you want me to do, Ben?
Shall I just give up my job?
Why should I give up my job?
I love my job.
My job is who I am.
You know, maybe I was right all along.
No man can handle what I do.
I can handle it.
- What...
What are you doing here?
- Declaring my allegiance.
This really isn't a good time.
So this is Hannah.
Wow.
Moving up in the world, Hannah.
Very cosy.
Very chic.
I have to go to work in a minute, Harry.
Not very you, though, is it?
I mean, you're not the stay-at-home type.
Look, I have a boyfriend.
(Belle) Whoo!
(Both laugh)
- Ben is my boyfriend.
- Yes.
He's a boy, but you need a man.
- Ben is a man.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- He looks more like a skinny kid to me.
Ben is actually one of the kindest and funniest,
- most decent people...
- Yeah.
But he doesn't excite you.
He doesn't get under your skin, not like I do.
(He sighs)
- I've got to go to work.
- Fine.
Whatever you say.
But I know who you are, Belle... and right nowyou're trying to be someone you're not.
I'm not trying to be someone I'm not.
I know exactly who I am and exactly what I'm doing,
- at home and in work, I'm totally in control.
- (Lift bell pings)
- Ooh!
- Whoa.
(Giggles)
- You must be Belle.
- Yeah, sorry.
You're Lewis, right?
Right.
I just got my heel caught.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Come in.
So, Lewis.
What can I do for you today?
- Whatever you want.
- No.
I believe the deal here is... whatever you want.
- I don't know...what I want.
- Come on, there must be something.
You can tell me.
Nothing too naughty.
No fantasy too filthy.
I like to be tested.
I like it to be hard.
(Moans)
(Breathing heavily)
(Gasps) Oh!
Oh.
Oh, God.
Er...
Whew.
I'm-I'm sorry.
I didn't...
I didn't realise.
- I can't believe I just did that.
- No, no, no. it's OK.
Don't worry.
That hasn't happened to me since sixth form, I swear.
- Oh, fuck!
- Ow!
Fuck!
Jeez.
I knew it.
- Ow.
- I know exactly who you are.
You're Hannah Baxter from school.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
That's horrible.
So, advertising?
- Wow.
At least I'm an honest prostitute.
- (Laughs)
What can I say?
I...
I've got a gift.
I can make even Hoovers seem sexy.
What about you?
- No, I think I draw the line at Hoovers.
- (Laughs)
No, I meant...
you could have done anything.
Why choose this?
Well, same reason you're in advertising, probably, I mean...
I'm good at it...
I think, and, erm...
I just...
I enjoy it.
You know, I like getting to know clients.
I like finding out their secrets.
I'm not really a virgin.
I was the animal guy, at college.
Last time I had a girlfriend I was 17.
Kind of like, erm, a private detective.
(Both chuckle)
Or a priest...ish.
Just like better underwear.
Just loads and loads of sex.
(Laughs)
Is it really that simple?
Well, no, I never said it was simple.
I'm going out with her, I'm falling in love with her, and I walk in and she's fucking some guy.
You sleep with other men, I sleep with other women.
It's my job, it's what I do.
It's different!
When are you gonna get it?
There is no Belle and there is no Hannah.
It's just you who doesn't know what you want.
Even though you had braces and huge teeth and were a bit chubby in school, I...
I always had the biggest crush on you.
Chubby?
Wow.
That's nice.
- Sorry.
- It's OK.
- Shall we have another round?
- Yeah.
- Cheers.
- Mm-mm.
There's nothing like colliding with your past to help you face your present.
(Taxi door shuts)
- What's going on?
- I meant what I said this morning.
- I can't take this any more.
- Are you leaving?
When we were just mates, you would tell me everything.
About life, about work.
No secrets.
But since we got together it's like...
I don't know anything about you.
- That's not true.
- No?
How honest have we been with each other lately?
- Things...have been difficult, Ben.
- I'm fine with what you do for a living.
I am.
What I can't deal with is what it's doing to us.
I don't trust you any more.
Let's just talk about it.
I can't just change overnight.
- There's nothing to talk about.
- Well, I won't go to Stephanie's tonight.
Please.
No, you go.
I'll meet you afterwards.
When?
Midnight.
Our place on the Embankment.
If you think you're ready to give up being Belle and give you and me a shot at a decent future, you come and meet me.
And if not...
It's your decision, Han.
Who do you want to be?
In life, there's always a moment... when your future depends on a choice,
#
Hi.
Belle!
There's someone I want you to meet.
My new girlfriend.
Sylvia Burke.
Crown Prosecutor.
Best there is.
Hello.
Nice to meet you.
Have...
Have we met before?
I don't think so, but I've heard a lot about you.
Got me bythe balls in the courtroom and the bedroom.

This is Marius.
Don't speakto him.
Gosh, you never stop, do you?
Marius is not a client.
Marius is my husband.
Oh.
(Chuckles)
Come along, Marius.
Time for your walk.
- (Stephanie) Belle!
- Hi!

Hannah?

I love you, Ben.
You're my best friend.
And I want you to have the best life.
But it's not with me.
I can't give you what you need and I can't change who I am.
And I wouldn't want you to change who you are.
You deserve so much better than that.
You deserve the best.
You know this is the end, Hannah.
Yeah?
We can't go back from this.
Some choices we make for ourselves in life,
And some we make for other people,
Not because we don'tlove them but because we do,
The only way we know it's right is if it lets us stay true to ourselves,
Butwe can't regret our choices,

Take a nice long bath.

Cut there, please.

- (Laughs)
- What?
(Man) Toast herface.
- (Laughter) - (2nd Man) Cut!
But now I'm back.
And now that I am back... he'll want me back.

He'll want me back.

You're my best friend.
And I want you to have the best life.
But it's not with me.
I can't give you what you need and I can't change who I am.
And I wouldn't want you to change who you are.
You deserve so much better than that.
You deserve the best.
You know this is the end, Hannah.
Yeah?
We can't go back from this.
(Belle) Some choices we make for ourselves in life.
And some we make for other people.
Not because we don't love them but because we do.
The only way we know it's right is if it lets us stay true to ourselves.
But we can't regret our choices.
The past is behind us.
All we have is the present... and the future... whatever that may bring.
Take a nice long bath.
Sorry!
(Laughs)
(Man, laughs) Cut there, please.

(Man) Toast her face.

And now that I am back... he'll want me back.
(Laughs)
He'll want me back.

Hey.
Why does everything look different?
And what have you done with my hair?
I distinctly remember leaving it right here, all over the place.
I'm cleaning up a little.
Oh, what?
'Cause you've stopped smoking weed, I can't either?
I'm trying to air the place out.

It's dead.
Ryan, it's been ten days.
What are you trying to prove?
I'm not trying to prove anything.
I just like feeling clear-headed for a change.
Now I've got more time for things like catching up on my reading, and learning yoga.
- Yoga?
- Yeah.
Kristen invited me to one of her classes.
Kristen?
Exactly how long is this pointless lifestyle experiment gonna last?
I've made some positive changes in my life.
In fact, last night I polished up
- my résumé.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy does it.
A job, Ryan?
You really think you're ready for that?
Up there?
I've never felt better.
Why are you trying to undermine my confidence?
It's like you're working against me.
Working against you?
Come on, mate.
Have a little faith.
Don't you think you're being a bit paranoid?
(Wilfred's voice fades and echoes in background)
Ryan, I know you've got your doubts.
But you're my best friend.
I love you, mate.
I'd never do anything to...
Ryan.
- Are you listening to me?
- Ah!
What?
I said I'd never do anything to harm you.
Mm.
A whimsical, light-bodied bouquet.
Crisp, with a hint of peach.
And a lingering, rotten-egg finish.
Exquisite.
(breathes out)
Boy, I needed this.
I have been so stressed lately.
What's up?
Dr. Ramos invited me to go to India for four months to help him open his new clinic.
Congratulations.
That's amazing.
Well, Leo doesn't want me to go.
He says I won't be able to adjust to a new culture.
Excuse me, but I was the one who was willing to live in the Valley.
(Kristen's voice fades)
Leo thinks I talk too much....
We actually haven't been talking.
Communicating at all...
Ryan.
Hey.
Do you see that guy?
Who are you talking about?
Never mind.
Oh, Ryan, you have to experience this.
Leathery, with subtle tones of menstruation.
When this s opens up, it's gonna be beautiful.
I wasn't going to tell you, because you've been acting so negative lately, but
I'm going on a date tomorrow night.
A date?
With who?
No one.
Just...
someone I met.
Met where?
Well, I...
No.
Oh, my God.
Please tell me that donkey-faced thing with the braces is not the chick you're going out with.
She doesn't have braces.
Yeah, you just can't see them, 'cause they're probably on her legs.
How do you think she supports that massive donkey face?
I think she's a great match for me.
She's a partner at a marketing firm, she enjoys fitness, and she's looking for a long-term relationship.
It's way too soon for that.
Let me find you a nice hit-it-and-quit-it chick.
Gross.
(sighs) Out of your league.
Lazy eye.
Balding Asian grandmother.
Gross!
Ooh.
Here we go.
Angelique.
Are you kidding?
Are you kidding?
"Favorite music: all types."
This chick must be, like, an expert in music.
Ryan, wait.
Look.
I get it.
You're feeling better about things.
You're cleaning and yogaing and not smoking, and life seems like one big, fluffy, pink cloud.
Yeah?
So?
It's not real.
You think your demons have vanished, but... that's a lie, mate.
No offense, but I think I know myself better than you do.
You're right.
What do I know?
I'm just your neighbor's dog who talks to you and doubles partner in Wii tennis.
You're totally fine.
Mm.
Everything looks so good.
I can't decide.
Ooh!
Red velvet.
I think I'm going to be a little bit naughty today.
(chuckles)
MAN:
Nice dog.
He's got quite a personality.
Yeah, that's Wilfred all right.
(scoffs) Wilfred?
Is that what he's calling himself now?
You know, that's real Italian leather.
He might want to get a sharper knife.
What...?
Yeah.
I see him, too.
And I hear him.
I hear the things he says.
- Okay, if this is some kind of twisted joke...
- No.
Wilfred ruined my life.
And you know what?
You're next.
I, I don't know why you've been following me around...
I'm Bruce.
Ryan, is it?
Don't you bullshit me, Ryan, you see him.
We both know what I'm talking about.
- Who are you?
- WILFRED:
Ryan?
Ryan!
Shit, he's coming.
Do not tell Wilfred we talked.
You-you call me when you're ready to learn the truth.
There you are.
Find anything interesting here?
Oh, no.
Not really.
RYAN:
Wilfred.
This... thing we have.
The way we... communicate.
Have you ever had this sort of relationship with anyone else?
Why do you ask?
Have you?
It happened once before.
I was at a party, and... this guy looked right at me and said,
"Hey.
What's up, dog?
I see you, and I know what you're up to."
I said, "Well, I see you, too.
If you've got something to say, say it."
Turns out he was talking to the guy right behind me, who'd been banging his wife.
Wait...
Ryan, please tell me there hasn't been been a guy standing behind me since we met.
(sighs)
(laughs)
So... nobody else?
You're one of a kind, Ryan.
(upbeat pop intro plays)
(singing in native language)
I had just gotten promoted to night manager.
So I decided to treat myself to a sweet-ass studio apartment.
Mini fridge, black light, you name it.
And one day, I stopped by my landlady's to drop off the rent, and this guy answers the door.
Now I can only assume, must be her mentally unstable son.
It looks like he's playing dress-up or something.
But what I didn't know was that other people didn't see what I saw.
Does this sound familiar?
Yeah.
I just never thought
I'd hear this from someone else.
Anyway, we smoke a joint.
Tells me a couple funny stories.
Next thing I know, I'm hanging out with him all the time.
I'm his Goddamn best friend.
Let me guess.
He talked you out of getting a job, didn't he?
Keeps you smoking weed all the time.
Hell, I bet he even got you to take a piss in some poor guy's hat.
Not exactly.
And then he convinced you to make out with your own father.
- What?
!
No!
- Yeah.
No.
I mean...
me, neither.
Look, I know Wilfred may not be the best influence, but he's-he's my friend.
Yeah, I thought so, too.
One night we're at this strip club.
Wilfred slips me a condom.
Shoves me in the V.I.P. room.
Turns out, he poked a hole in the tip of that condom.
Next thing I know, I'm the proud father of Cinnamon Sizzle's first-born twins.
- Jesus!
- But the whole time, through all the boozing, debauchery, and making out with... well, people I won't normally made out with,
I never doubted that Wilfred was looking out for me.
I can tell you don't believe me.
But just ask yourself this.
How well do you really know Wilfred?
Uh, I'll be back from the dentist in a couple hours, so just hang out on the coach, and--
I don't know-- do whatever it is you do when I'm not around.
Later, man.
I'm sure I'll be right here on the coach where you left me.

Hello, Bruce.
I should've known you'd have a hand in this.
And you, Ryan-- conspiring with this lunatic behind my back.
Okay, it's true.
I met Bruce
- a couple days ago, and...
- He told you
- some crazy story about me ruining his life?
- Ryan, don't listen to him-- he's just trying to get inside your head.
Who you gonna believe, Ryan?
WILFRED:
Whoa, whoa.
What?
We can't leave him here, Ryan.
Now, I don't know what you are.
I don't know if you're a devil, an alien, or something crazier than that, but someone's got to stop you.
You're not well, mate.
Now, listen to me...
I'm through listening to you!
Violence is never the answer.
As the great Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once said... (grunts)
- Ryan!
Give me the gun!
- Don't do it, Ryan!
He's gonna ruin your life like he ruined mine!
- Give me that gun!
- Bullshit!
Did you tell Ryan about your cocaine addiction?
Or your weakness for prostitutes?
You convinced me to make out with my own father.
Everyone at the party loved it!
They thought it was edgy!
(Bruce yells)
(grunting, panting)
Stop!
(gunshot)
Not up there, you idiot!
He's down here!
I don't want to do this.
WILFRED (distorted):
Kill him, Ryan!
Kill him...!

Well done, Ryan.
Well done.
Look what you made me do?
Oh, no, this was your choice.
What are you talking about?
I just killed a man!
Or did you?
(gunshot) (gasps, pants)
Oh!

What the hell is going on?
Isn't it obvious?
No, it's not obvious!
Nothing is ever obvious with you!
May I?
Hi, Ryan.
Hi, Bruce.
Here's the thing, pal.
This shit is complicated.
Good game, Bruce.
I'll get you next time.
Yeah, we'll see about that.
See you around, kid.
"Good game"?
Well, it was more of a contest, really.
And...
I won.
But the real winner... is you.
- And me, of course.
- That doesn't
- really clear things up for me, Wilfred.
- Look, mate, remember the other day when I told you that your problems hadn't simply vanished?
I warned you something like this would happen, but you doubted me.
So you made something like this happen?
The fact is, you had your doubts, so I put you to the test, and when the chips were down, you chose faith over doubt.
You chose me.
So... who-who the hell was that guy?
What guy?
Bruce!
The guy who was just here!
I don't know who you're talking about, mate.
B... but he was... but you...
Oh, oh, Bruce?
The guy who was just here, Bruce Bruce-- oh, yeah, he's gone-- for now.
But listen, if you see him around again, you need to let me know, okay?

I guess you were right.
I still have a long road ahead of me.
And all those positive changes I thought I made... were just fluffy pink clouds.

Thanks.
(match strikes) You know...
I really think I'm gonna be all right.
'Course you are.
I ain't going anywhere.
All right, all right.
Fair enough.
I'll tell you how I met Bruce.
It was about five years ago.
I was hanging around this college campus.
Bruce was a professor there.
And one day, he wrote this super-complicated math equation on the board that no one could solve, except me-- the janitor.
Matt Damon?
Good Will Hunting?
Okay.
It's only fair you know the truth about Bruce.
(sighs)
But I haven't told this to anyone.
I was a young pup at the time.
Good-looking, but a little messed-up in the head.
I met Bruce while I was infiltrating the Boston Police Department for this Irish mobster...
The Departed?
You want to know how I met Bruce?
The truth is...
I don't remember.
All right, well, at least that's an honest answer.
There's a lot of things I don't remember:
where I'm from, how I got here.
There's only one thing I do know.
My name is Jason Bourne.

Now, I don't know what you are.
I don't know if you're a devil, an alien or something crazier than that, but someone's gotta stop you.
You're not well, mate.
Now, listen to me.
I'm through listening to you.
Violence is never the answer.
As the great Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said.
Oh, shit.
Jesus.
Ryan.
Give me the gun.
Don't do it, Ryan.
He's gonna ruin your life like mine.
Give me that gun.
Bullshit.
Tell Ryan about your cocaine addiction?
Or your weakness for prostitutes?
You convinced me to make out with my father.
Everyone at the party loved it.
They thought it was edgy.
Stop!
Not up there, you idiot.
He's down here.
I don't wanna do this.
Kill him, Ryan.
Kill him!
Well done, Ryan.
Well done.
Look what you made me do.
Oh, no, this was your choice.
What are you talking about?
I just killed a man.
Or did you?
Oh!
Ha, ha.
Blanks?
What the hell is going on?
Isn't it obvious?
No, it's not obvious.
Nothing is ever obvious with you.
May I?
Hi, Ryan.
Hi, Bruce.
Here's the thing, pal.
This shit is complicated.
Good game, Bruce.
I'll get you next time.
Yeah, we'll see about that.
See you around, kid.
Good game?
Well, it was more of a contest, really.
And I won.
But the real winner is you.
And me, of course.
That doesn't really clear things up for me, Wilfred.
Remember the other day when I told you that your problems hadn't simply vanished?
I warned you something like this would happen, you doubted me.
So you made something like this happen?
The fact is, you had your doubts, so I put you to the test and when the chips were down, you chose faith over doubt.
You chose me.
So who the hell was that guy?
What guy?
Bruce.
The guy who was just here.
I don't know who you're talking about, mate.
But he was ...
But you ...
Oh, oh, Bruce?
The guy who was just here, "Bruce" Bruce.
Oh, yeah, he's gone, for now.
Listen.
If you see him around again, you need to let me know, okay?
I guess you were right.
I still have a long road ahead of me.
And all those positive changes I thought I made were just fluffy pink clouds.
Yeah.
But those clouds have a silver lining.
Me.
You don't have to go it alone, Ryan.
Thanks.
You know I really think I'm gonna be all right.
Of course you are.
I ain't going anywhere.
All right, all right.
Fair enough.
I'll tell you how I met Bruce.
It was about five years ago.
I was hanging around this college campus.
Bruce was a professor there.
And one day, he wrote this super-complicated math equation on the board that no one could solve, except me, the janitor.
Matt Damon?
Good Will Hunting?
Okay.
It's only fair you know the truth about Bruce.
But I haven't told this to anyone.
I was a young pup at the time.
Good-looking, but a little messed-up in the head.
I met Bruce while I was infiltrating the Boston Police Department for this Irish mobster.
The Departed?
You want to know how I met Bruce?
The truth is I don't remember.
All right, well that's an honest answer.
There's a lot of things I don't remember.
Where I'm from?
How I got here?
There's only one thing I do know.
My name is Jason Bourne.
Hey.
Why does everything look different?
And what have you done with my hair?
I distinctly remember leaving it right here, all over the place.
I'm cleaning up a little.
Oh, what?
'Cause you've stopped smoking weed, I can't either?
I'm trying to air the place out.
(yelling)
(yelling)
(vacuum cleaner dies)
Sorry, Ryan!
Rah!
Die!
Evil!
Robot!
(panting)
It's dead.
Ryan, it's been ten days.
What are you trying to prove?
I'm not trying to prove anything.
I just like feeling clear-headed for a change.
Now I've got more time for things like catching up on my reading, and learning yoga.
- Yoga?
- Yeah.
Kristen invited me to one of her classes.
Kristen?
Exactly how long is this pointless lifestyle experiment gonna last?
I've made some positive changes in my life.
In fact, last night I polished up
- my résumé.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy does it.
A job, Ryan?
You really think you're ready for that?
Up there?
I've never felt better.
Why are you trying to undermine my confidence?
It's like you're working against me.
Working against you?
Come on, mate.
Have a little faith.
Don't you think you're being a bit paranoid?
(Wilfred's voice fades and echoes in background)
Ryan, I know you're ***, but you're my best friend.
I love you, mate.
I'd never do anything to...
Ryan.
- Are you listening to me?
- Ah!
What?
I said I'd never do anything to harm you.
Mm.
A whimsical, light-bodied bouquet.
Crisp, with a hint of peach.
And a lingering, rotten-egg finish.
Exquisite.
(breathes out)
Boy, I needed this.
I have been so stressed lately.
What's up?
Dr. Ramos invited me to go to India for four months to help him open his new clinic.
Congratulations.
That's amazing.
Well, Leo doesn't want me to go.
He says I won't be able to adjust to a new culture.
Excuse me, but I was the one who was willing to live in the Valley.
(Kristen's voice fades)
Leo thinks I talk too much....
We actually haven't been talking.
Communicating at all...
Ryan.
Hey.
Do you see that guy?
Who are you talking about?
Never mind.
Oh, Ryan, you have to experience this.
Leathery, with subtle tones of menstruation.
When this s opens up, it's gonna be beautiful.
I wasn't going to tell you, because you've been acting so negative lately, but
I'm going on a date tomorrow night.
A date?
With who?
No one.
Just...
someone I met.
Met where?
Well, I...
No.
Oh, my God.
Please tell me that donkey-faced thing with the braces is not the chick you're going out with.
She doesn't have braces.
Yeah, you just can't see them, 'cause they're probably on her legs.
How do you think she supports that massive donkey face?
I think she's a great match for me.
She's a partner at a marketing firm, she enjoys fitness, and she's looking for a long-term relationship.
It's way too soon for that.
Let me find you a nice hit-it-and-quit-it chick.
Gross.
(sighs) Out of your league.
Lazy eye.
Balding Asian grandmother.
Gross!
Ooh.
Here we go.
Angelique.
Are you kidding?
Are you kidding?
"Favorite music: all types."
This chick must be, like, an expert in music.
Ryan, wait.
Look.
I get it.
You're feeling better about things.
You're cleaning and yogaing and not smoking, and life seems like one big, fluffy, pink cloud.
Yeah?
So?
It's not real.
You think your demons have vanished, but... that's a lie, mate.
No offense, but I think I know myself better than you do.
You're right.
What do I know?
I'm just your neighbor's dog who talks to you and doubles partner in Wii tennis.
You're totally fine.
Mm.
Everything looks so good.
I can't decide.
Ooh!
Red velvet.
I think I'm going to be a little bit naughty today.
(chuckles)
MAN:
Nice dog.
He's got quite a personality.
Yeah, that's Wilfred all right.
(scoffs) Wilfred?
Is that what he's calling himself now?
You know, that's real Italian leather.
He might want to get a sharper knife.
What...?
Yeah.
I see him, too.
And I hear him.
I hear the things he says.
- Okay, if this is some kind of twisted joke...
- No.
Wilfred ruined my life.
And you know what?
You're next.
I, I don't know why you've been following me around...
I'm Bruce.
Ryan, is it?
Don't you bullshit me, Ryan, you see him.
We both know what I'm talking about.
- Who are you?
- WILFRED:
Ryan?
Ryan!
Shit, he's coming.
Do not tell Wilfred we talked.
You-you call me when you're ready to learn the truth.
There you are.
Find anything interesting here?
Oh, no.
Not really.
RYAN:
Wilfred.
This... thing we have.
The way we... communicate.
Have you ever had this sort of relationship with anyone else?
Why do you ask?
Have you?
It happened once before.
I was at a party, and... this guy looked right at me and said,
"Hey.
What's up, dog?
I see you, and I know what you're up to."
I said, "Well, I see you, too.
If you've got something to say, say it."
Turns out he was talking to the guy right behind me, who'd been banging his wife.
Wait...
Ryan, please tell me there hasn't been been a guy standing behind me since we met.
(sighs)
(laughs)
So... nobody else?
You're one of a kind, Ryan.
(upbeat pop intro plays)
(singing in native language)
I had just gotten promoted to night manager.
So I decided to treat myself to a sweet-ass studio apartment.
Mini fridge, black light, you name it.
And one day, I stopped by my landlady's to drop off the rent, and this guy answers the door.
Now I can only assume, must be her mentally unstable son.
It looks like he's playing dress-up or something.
But what I didn't know was that other people didn't see what I saw.
Does this sound familiar?
Yeah.
I just never thought
I'd hear this from someone else.
Anyway, we smoke a joint.
Tells me a couple funny stories.
Next thing I know, I'm hanging out with him all the time.
I'm his Goddamn best friend.
Let me guess.
He talked you out of getting a job, didn't he?
Keeps you smoking weed all the time.
Hell, I bet he even got you to take a piss in some poor guy's hat.
Not exactly.
And then he convinced you to make out with your own father.
- What?
!
No!
- Yeah.
No.
I mean...
me, neither.
Look, I know Wilfred may not be the best influence, but he's-he's my friend.
Yeah, I thought so, too.
One night we're at this strip club.
Wilfred slips me a condom.
Shoves me in the V.I.P. room.
Turns out, he poked a hole in the tip of that condom.
Next thing I know, I'm the proud father of Cinnamon Sizzle's first-born twins.
- Jesus!
- But the whole time, through all the boozing, debauchery, and making out with... well, people I won't normally made out with,
I never doubted that Wilfred was looking out for me.
I can tell you don't believe me.
But just ask yourself this.
How well do you really know Wilfred?
Uh, I'll be back from the dentist in a couple hours, so just hang out on the coach, and--
I don't know-- do whatever it is you do when I'm not around.
Later, man.
I'm sure I'll be right here on the coach where you left me.

It's me...
Angelique...
Oh.
Hi.
Hey, just to warn you, I had a gin and Sprite... while I was getting ready.
Okay, two.
(laughing)
(continues laughing)
Oh, where's your fedora?
You said in your message you were gonna wear it.
My message
Oh, my God.
Some of the things that you wrote were so gross...
I almost didn't come here on this date.
But then I was, like... gross is kind of hot, right?
And all of that stuff about the post office...
I don't really know... what "snout rape" means but I hate my mailman, too.
(phone ringing)
- WILFRED (over phone): 23 inches, Ryan.
- What?
I know, right?
Why the hell am I on a date with Angelique and not the girl I picked?
Angelique is an alcoholic blow-job machine.
And you're welcome.
L-listen, I think I'm just gonna head home and call it a night.
Why don't I just pay for my drink and...
Oh, I get it.
Let's head home?
Call it a night?
I'm down with that.
- Will you excuse me?
- Yeah.
Shitty date, huh?
What are you doing here?
Do you believe me now, Ryan?
I don't know who to believe anymore.
Then test that condom.
It's not too late for you, Ryan.
Get rid of Wilfred.
Get your life back.
Get rid of him?
You mean kill him.
What's wrong with you?
Oh, you don't kill him!
You take him out in the middle of nowhere and ditch him!
- But he's not even my dog.
I...
- Shh!
He's not your dog... but he's your problem.
All right.
I'll do it.
Hey.
Uh, give me just a second.
(flushes toilet)
Did you just...
Shh...!
Let me just wash my hands.
(turns on faucet)
Wait, so, where we're going there's an acre, a full acre of just pot plants, all for the taking?
And there's no security?
That's what the guy at the dispensary said.
So, would I be able to, like, stuff this whole knapsack full of weed?
(engine starts) Sure.
Never smelled that before.
Never smelled that before.
Never smelled...
that before.
- Oh... shoot!
- Never smelled that before.
I-I just realized, I left the granola bars back in the car.
(exhales)
- I'm sorry, I'll just go get them.
- I'll come with you.
No, th-that's okay.
Uh, just go ahead;
I'll catch up.
You stay here-- I'll go back to the car.
No, no, no, no.
No, no.
Just... stay, Wilfred.
Stay.
Is something going on, mate?
You're acting kind of...
Wait, are you... leaving me here?
(twig snaps)
- What was that?
- What was what?
Bruce.
What are you doing here?
Who are you talking to, mate?
Bruce.
You don't see him?
See who?
I knew he'd do this.
He sees me-- he's just being a dick.
Ryan, there's just you and me here, you know that, right?
You're really starting to worry me now.
Look, let's just go back to the car... (sneezes) Oh, dude, you are bloody kidding me!
See?
He knows I'm here.
(panting)
Hello, Bruce.
I should've known you'd have a hand in this.
And you, Ryan-- conspiring with this lunatic behind my back.
Okay, it's true.
I met Bruce
- a couple days ago, and...
- He told you
- some crazy story about me ruining his life?
- Ryan, don't listen to him-- he's just trying to get inside your head.
Who you gonna believe, Ryan?
WILFRED:
Whoa, whoa.
What?
We can't leave him here, Ryan.
Now, I don't know what you are.
I don't know if you're a devil, an alien, or something crazier than that, but someone's got to stop you.
You're not well, mate.
Now, listen to me...

Okay, gentlemen, I hope you have your calendars marked, because the annual guy trip is coming up.
Oh, we still doing that?
What do you mean, are we still doing that?
Of course we're still doing that.
Nothing's changed.
We've been doing that for 15 years.
Well, I just assumed since you cancelled last year's trip...
I did not cancel.
I postponed, because my son was being born.
Well, we all make choices.
Aw, come on.
Oh, we're not judging you, buddy.
It's... things change.
No, no, no!
Nothing has changed.
Guys, come on.
Brief hiatus.
We're back on track.
We just thought that Lisa would...
Lisa?
Please.
Guys, come on.
I made it very clear to her on our second date that the guy trip was grandfathered into our relationship.
Wait.
Grandfathered?
Oh.
You're not familiar with the grandfather clause?
It is so awesome.
Yeah, honey, all trips and traditions with a clearly established history at the commencement of our relationship retain their binding status through the duration of said relationship.
In perpetuity.
God, it's hot when you talk like a notary.
Really?
Well...
Oh, since we're grandfathering things in, my mother will be staying with us for a month... every summer.
No.
What?
No, no, no, because you can't grandfather in new stuff.
That's not a, uh...
Do you understand the term "grandfather clause," sweetie?
Well, boys, since it's my turn to choose,
I am thinking about New Orleans this year.
- Ooh.
- You know?
You got great food, tasty cocktails, live music.
It's good.
I like it.
No, no, no, no, no.
It's my turn to choose.
- But you got to choose last year.
- Whoa, wait.
I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
You guys both acknowledged that I retain the right to choose.
I mean, you signed a statement to that effect.
I have the burrito wrapper in my wallet.
Burrito wrapper.
I signed that wrapper under duress.
Yeah, it's still binding.
He initialed it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I did.
Okay, well, I want it on record that I get to choose next year, okay?
- Fine.
- Fine.
Also, I want it on the burrito wrapper.
Okay, I have both your signatures here.
It is now official that I will pick the 2012 guy trip.
Now we just need a signature of a witness.
- Burrito Bob, if you'd be so kind.
- Sure thing.
And would it be bad form to ask for a wee bit more gwawcamole?
- It's "guacamole."
- Guacamole.
Gwawcamole.
- Guacamole.
- Guacamole.
Gwackamo...
It's made with avocawdoes.
- Avocadoes.
- Avocadoes.
Avocawdoes.
Uh-oh.
Look out.
Gonna have to get Tommy some more apple sauce.
He's got a gun.
Oh!
Honey, no!
Hands are for clapping, not for shooting.
Oh!
Where does he get this stuff?
I don't know.
I think boys are just born with it.
All right, bud, we're out of potato chips.
I'm going in.
Gonna cover me?
I didn't do that.
Guess who's here.
- Oh.
- Hey.
There's my babe.
Hey.
- Look at this kid.
- Oh, come here!
Man, you are getting really big, little buddy.
He is, right?
- Yeah, definitely.
- Oh!
I mean, he's not gonna be a toddler for long.
I mean, this is practically a full-blown kid right here.
It's like the crossover point between, uh, giant baby and a tiny regular person.
You know what I mean?
God, where does the time go?
I mean, I remember when you were just a ball of nothing.
Oh, my gosh.
God, Adam's right.
Mike, it's going by too fast.
- We need new pictures.
- Yeah, I'll take some tomorrow.
No, no.
Professional pictures.
We need professional pictures, Mike.
He's only this age once.
Right.
Totally.
I'm gonna get me another glass of wine.
Adam?
I'm okay.
Come on!
- What are you doing to me?
- What?
What? "Won't be a toddler much longer."
"Where has the time gone?"
You are using intentionally provocative words.
I am not.
Yeah, you inflamed the mother gland.
Look at her.
She's all misty.
Yeah, look at her.
She's squeezing him like she wants to keep him that size forever.
Yes!
And now I got to go out and get more pictures made.
I mean, come on!
It's just gonna be frames?
I'm sure there's probably gonna be a calendar.
I mean, this is gonna be a minimum of 300 bucks!
Out of my pocket.
Thank you very much.
Look, is it my fault that you got a cute kid?
No, that is all me.
Hey, I'm gonna put him to bed, okay?
And I'm gonna help her... jerk!
My...
I want to take those pictures.
What?
They need photos of Tommy.
I want to take 'em.
Make it happen.
Cal, I-I don't know.
You know, I'm not a big fan of mixing friends and business.
Hey, there's a lot of money in kids photography.
I could establish a portfolio, maybe get some new clients.
Be out of debt in no time.
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's a great...
Yeah, Callie, you are a professional photographer.
You should take those professional photos of Tommy just to beat back the hands of time.
Oh, my God, that's right!
That's a great idea.
I love your work.
- That would be amazing.
- That would be amazing.
And I'll do it for free!
What?
No, we couldn't ask you to do that.
They couldn't ask you to do that.
No.
It's fine.
You know, tell your friends.
Well, they'll pay you and tell their friends.
I didn't just, uh...
Nope.
Okay, so you got it, right?
Cardigan, rocking chair, book.
- Got it.
- Got it.
Go to work, Lisa.
We got it covered.
Come on, it's three against one.
I'm sure we can get a good picture.
- Don't ever grow up.
- I won't!
All right, let's get a book in the kid's hand, and then we'll get done with this, okay?
All right, you sit here, buddy, okay?
All right.
Oh, come on!
Who's calling?
Aah!
Hi, baby.
Oh.
Really?
Okay.
No, don't worry about it.
We'll figure it out.
I love you.
Bye.
Book's no good.
No.
Lisa just remembered that Otis, Tommy's friend down the street, just got his pictures taken,
- book-in-hand.
- Derivative.
Mm-hmm.
Oh!
I got it!
My mom just sent pictures of me when I was a kid the same age, wearing this kick-ass cowboy outfit.
I got it in the garage still.
I love it!
It's like father, like son.
Oh, yeah, dude.
This is a homerun.
I mean, as soon as she sees these photos, she's gonna burn through an entire box of tissue.
I'm gonna blow her mind.
You know what?
I'm just getting misty anticipating her getting misty.
Why are you so upset?
Are you kidding me?
What?
No!
I think he looks great.
He is holding a gun in every picture.
He's like a baby Ted Nugent.
It's okay.
He's a sheriff.
He's licensed to carry a gun.
In fact, he's honor bound.
I think he looks kind of bad ass.
Violence never solved anything, Lisa.
Come on, Lisa.
Boys will be boys.
I mean, you can make a gun out of anything.
Look.
Dr. Einstein's a gun.
Okay, all right.
All right.
Okay, stop, stop.
Stop!
I just...
I just don't want
Tommy playing with guns is all.
What?
Come on.
I grew up with guns.
Hunting is a big part of my childhood.
You grew up in the suburbs.
Yeah, but my dad made sure he took me and my brothers on a big hunting trip every year.
You saying I was raised wrong?
Do you want to call my Mom?
Go ahead.
Okay, yeah.
You call my mom, and you tell her I was raised wrong.
That's okay, yeah.
I'm gonna do that.
Calm it down.
Calm it down.
You should tell her how bad I was raised.
I'm just saying that you've evolved, is all.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
- It's a good thing.
- I have not evolved.
Come on.
I am still the same guy I've always been.
I'm a hunter.
Eh.
You used to hunt.
I totally am a hunter!
I hunt!
You have not been hunting in years.
Certainly not since we've been married.
Yeah, well, that's because we've just gone on other trips.
You know, otherwise, I would have been out there every year hunting and killing things.
In fact, that's why, uh, we're going hunting on the guy trip this year.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Yes, we are.
And this has nothing to do with the fact that I don't want Tommy playing with guns?
Lisa, please.
Suddenly you have a desire to bring home a large animal and make a chili out of it?
Or a stew, and you're gonna be cooking it.
Hunting.
No, whoa, whoa, no way!
That does not work for me.
Why?
!
Why?
There are so many reasons why.
It's cold.
There's hunting.
No mattresses.
And there's hunting.
Mike, we went with you that one time a million years ago.
It was terrible.
No.
I think this is a great trip for us.
Come on, guys.
Look, let's face it.
We've all gotten a little soft, especially you, Adam.
Me?
Moving in with your girlfriend.
You married your girlfriend, bro.
You're softer than a down pillow, which by the way, we will not have on this hunting trip.
You know, I quite love the idea of a hunting trip.
Yes!
Ugh!
I probably won't actually hunt, per se.
But I like the camouflage.
It's a good look for me.
Hey, it's a good look for all of us.
Hey, you know what I like is those duck whistles.
Those crack me up.
You know?
No.
No, hunting sucks, even with the duck whistles.
Mike, let's go to New Orleans, all right?
Or better yet, if you don't like that idea because I came up with it, why don't we go anywhere else in the entire world where intoxicated men don't walk around the woods with firearms?
Nope.
We kind of have to go hunting.
I took a stand with Lisa.
Oh, you took a stand with Lisa.
Why didn't you say so?
Absolutely, we have to go hunting.
Ethan?
Yeah.
He took a stand.
Oh, good.
So we're going hunting?
I was being sarcastic!
Too late.
Two against one.
You lose.
Also, Adam, um, there's a little issue with the photos.
No.
You know what?
No.
No, Mike.
This is exactly what I was talking about when I said I didn't want to mix business and friends.
You know, I don't want to be put in the middle of this.
Oh, my God, they hated them!
I can't breathe.
Oh, no, no.
Sweetie, you didn't hear me correctly.
They love what you did artistically, okay?
It's just, Lisa has a problem with the guns, that's it.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
You're sure they're not just using the guns as a smokescreen because they didn't want to tell me they hated the photos?
Smokescreen?
I didn't use any smokescreen.
That's what I told her.
Smokescreen.
Look, I'm just the messenger, all right?
Which I will remind you I did not want to be.
So it's not a smokescreen?
No.
God, no.
In fact, they want you to come back and take more pictures.
And this time, they really want to pay you.
All right, so, that is it.
I am officially out of this madness, okay?
Here's the thing.
She says you don't have to pay her.
What?
Callie?
They insist on paying you.
I know.
I just don't...
Wait.
You need to say yes right now.
Please, please put an end to this.
Okay.
Yeah.
No, that seems fair.
Thank God.
Oh.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Good night.
Good night.
Oh, did they mention what time they want me to be there?
Oh, my God!
- These are great!
- Wow!
Oh, I'm so glad.
All right, well, here is my bill.
Okay.
I'm just gonna leave it there.
You can pay me whenever, and of course,
I gave you the friends and family discount.
- Oh.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- All right.
- All right, yay, no guns!
I got to go.
All right.
I'll see you.
Oh.
Oh!
Look at this!
Oh.
Oh, my God!
$1,100?
!
That can't be right.
Oh, yeah, it is.
She even had the balls to put smiley faces in all of the zeroes.
That takes some stones.
Ugh!
Kind of impressive.
What?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, hey, so you're gonna talk to Adam about this bill, right?
Nope.
But you're gonna be with him all weekend.
On the guy trip.
This is a domestic concern.
No domestic concerns on the guy trip.
Okay, but you're not on the guy trip yet.
Hmm, technically, the guy trip started last night.
We're only leaving at dawn 'cause it's way cooler.
It's way cooler, is it?
Yeah.
Like, 40% cooler.
40%?
Yeah, maybe 50%.
I don't know.
You tell me, as I disappear into the shadows with my guns.
Can you open that for me?
Dawn.
Who leaves at dawn?
If we were in New Orleans right now,
I'd just be heading home.
Following a brass band.
I love that you're leaving at dawn.
- Why?
- I don't know.
It's kind of sexy, like something a commando might do.
Commando, eh?
Yeah, you heard me.
Yeah.
I got that new Savage 308.
Can't wait to pull that baby out.
Hey.
What took you so long?
We've been here, for, like 20 minutes.
Oh, nothing.
You just had sex, didn't you?
Oh...
I mean, the classy move is not to acknowledge it.
No, the classy move is to take longer than 20 minutes.
- Oh...
- Oh...
Look how Mike packed extra zingers!
I mean, the reason it took 20 minutes is 'cause I knew you guys were waiting for me down here, and then, you know, I was just thinking about you the whole time.
- Oh, come on.
- That's nauseating.
That's not how I meant that.
You know what I meant.
- Guy trip!
- Guy trip!
I'm just saying, you know, the driver has the hardest job, so I think I deserve one of the two breakfast sandwiches.
Come on.
We Rochambeau'ed for it.
You know, I had rock.
Ethan had rock.
You had scissors.
Respect the rock, Michael.
Plus, it's kind of your own fault.
Because if we had stopped earlier, like I wanted to, then there would be enough breakfast sandwiches for everybody, but you just enjoy that, uh, taco.
Fine.
Okay, you know what?
Let's just go over the rules.
Per tradition, no contact with the outside world.
Which means we have to put our cell phones in this bag right here.
Whoa, whoa.
That's ridiculous.
No.
I need my phone.
Yeah, I kind of need mine, too.
All right, well, for emergencies.
All right, so we're keeping the phones.
Yeah, but we're putting the ringers on "off."
Why are we even doing this?
Because we didn't have cell phones when we went on our first guy trip.
Yeah, well, we didn't have jobs, either.
Or breakfast sandwiches.
You know, can I just say that the breakfast sandwich is the greatest invention of the last 15 years?
Hallelujah.
Cheers to you.
All right.
You know what?
You're just rubbing it in now.
Oh, Carl.
Hello.
You're up.
Hi, little man.
Wait, wait.
You did not sneak Carl on the guy trip.
I did not sneak him.
I decided he should come.
It's called the guy trip.
It's not called the three guys and a dog trip.
Well, you know, Carl's one of the guys.
No.
How is he one of the...
You know, it's upsetting.
I'm upset.
- What, you're upset?
- Yes.
Well, what if I gave you half my breakfast sandwich?
I'd still be upset.
But I'd take it.
Good to know.
Here you go.
Oh, come on.
That is cruel.
Relax.
I'm sure Carl's willing to share it with you.
Oh, yeah.
I can get it straight back from him.
Good.
Give me...
Carl, Carl.
Carl.
Ah!
Oh...
Work on this.
Ah!
What is that?
It is glistening.
Get that out of my face.
There's a hair on it.
I will pull this car over right now.
I'm sorry, Lis.
I-I didn't want to overcharge you.
I just...
I got a sense of the going rate, and I wrote something down.
I didn't want things to get weird.
Yeah.
I didn't want them to get weird, either.
You know what?
I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna tear this up.
Aw...
And you can just pay me whatever you think I'm worth.
I'm still trying to figure out how come Carl and I had to sleep on the pull-out.
Adam and I had rock.
You had scissors.
Got to respect the rock, Ethan.
I do respect the rock, Michael.
It's just Carl had paper.
Yeah, but his paper doesn't count.
All he can do is paper.
Hi, Lis.
Is Tommy okay?
Are you okay?
Is anyone turning blue?
No?
Okay.
Then why are you calling me?
Because Callie just told me to pay her what I think she's worth.
Really?
- She said that?
- Mmm.
She said that.
"Pay what you think I'm worth"?
Wow.
It's actually kind of brilliant.
It's totally brilliant.
She boxed me in.
Yeah, yeah, she did do that.
Well, good luck with that.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You're helping me with this.
Quick, she's in the bathroom.
No.
Lisa, I'm on the guy trip.
Is that Carl?
Don't even get me started.
Good luck and I will see you when we get back.
No.
I'll see you later.
Good-bye.
Wait.
No.
Michael.
Hey.
Wow, huh?
Lots of cargo space.
This trunk's really roomy.
Yeah, well, you know, when you're in the wild, you need, uh...
All right.
Before you say anything...
You look like a traffic cone.
Okay.
Well... at least 40 men per year are shot by other semi-intoxicated men who mistake them for deer, so...
I'm just not going to take that chance out here.
'Cause I got a lot to live for.
The irony is, wearing all that orange actually makes me want to shoot you.
That's a felony, Mike.
It's just the three of us out here.
Come on, Mike.
You wouldn't last a week on the inside.
I'd do great on the inside.
Yeah, but not for the reasons you think.
This is really hard because we're friends.
Okay.
But imagine we aren't friends.
Pretend this is just a business thing.
But we are friends.
Okay, but what if we weren't?
What would you say?
If we weren't friends?
Okay, then I would say,
"$1,100 is kind of steep,
"especially for someone who didn't show much judgment when it came to photographing my child with firearms."
As a joke, I would say that.
- Oh.
- You know?
Yeah.
No.
And I guess I would say, you know, "Hey, lady, relax about the guns already."
That's funny.
And then I would say something like,
"Don't tell me how to raise my child, random chick I'm paying."
And then I would say, "Paying?
That's funny.
I don't see a check in my hand."
Guys.
Did you not see my signal?
What?
The Black Power salute?
No.
This is the universal sign for stop.
I've never seen anybody do...
Shh!
What's that one?
What does that mean?
That means look over there without talking.
Oh...
Yeah.
I think we got a deer over there.
Oh.
Really?
With the ring?
I thought we talked about this.
I'm sorry.
I got a new phone.
You don't have to whisper now.
It's gone.
You know what?
Just answer it.
Go ahead.
Ethan, it's you.
- What?
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
I must have butt-dialed you when Mike made us crouch.
I guess it was your fault, Mike.
You and your angry pantomiming.
You guys are idiots.
It's nice to be outside, though.
Yeah, it's lovely.
Look at the way the light hits those branches.
- Poetic.
- Beautiful.
What just happened?
Did we just have a fight?
Yeah, we totally did.
Well, if we did, and I wanted to say I was sorry,
I would probably say something like, "I'm sorry."
I would probably say something like, "Let's stop all this and toast to our friendship, yo!" Ooh.
Cheers.
I feel silly.
You were actually being very generous when you suggested that we pay you what you're worth.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Oh, sweetie pie, you-you signed it, but you did not fill out the amount.
- Uh-huh.
Just fill in the amount you think is right.
Well-played.
I know.
Do you want to open up another bottle?
- Yes.
- Let's get lit.
Oh, of course.
Oh...
Oh, really?
It's Callie.
It's your choice.
Okay.
Sorry...
Do not...
I forbid you to answer the phone.
What, are you kidding me?
Don't.
Don't.
Hey, sweetie.
Hey, sweetie.
Oh, is this a bad time?
No.
You know what?
It's never a bad time when you call me.
Oh, I love you.
Smoochie, smooch, smooch.
Yeah.
Barf.
Why'd you call me?
Actually, you called me.
I'm in the middle of a deer-hunting trip.
Did you just drunk-dial me?
No, I...
Hey.
Um, how much are two cheap plane tickets to New Orleans right now?
She wants to go to N'Orleans.
Well, with advanced price, and it's not like I've been looking up the fares online or anything, it would be, hmm... $518 if we don't check any bags.
Hey.
We're going to New Orleans, sweetie.
$518.
How's that sound to you?
- Huh?
That fair?
- That sounds great.
You know what?
$600.
You're drunk.
I'm not drunk.
You're drunk.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm going to let you go.
All right.
I love you, baby.
Tell Mike I want another kid!
All right.
I love you.
Bye.
You'll love this.
Lisa and Callie are day-drunk, right?
They come over...
Save it.
I'm done.
- What?
Why?
- Because!
Neither of you guys take this seriously.
Of course we don't.
I mean, I didn't even want to come on this trip in the first place.
And the only reason you wanted to come is because you backed yourself into proving some weird point with Lisa.
No.
You know, that's only a half-truth.
I-I wanted to come back here because this is the first place we took a guy trip.
I just kind of wanted to get back to that.
Why?
It was kind of a mediocre trip, Mike.
You were the only one who shot anything.
We've had better trips.
Absolutely.
I mean, do you remember the Trail of Tears/Barbecue trip of 2006?
I mean, we learned a little bit and then we ate a whole lot.
It was a trip.
You're right.
We've had a lot of great trips.
We have.
You know, it's just that right now, my life...
It just feels like it's full of diapers and depositions.
And don't get me wrong.
I love my job and I love my family.
But I got to know, on some level, that we're still those same guys that we were
15 years ago.
All right, Mike.
Give me the bag.
- What?
- Yeah, come on.
This means a lot to you and, uh, we're with you.
So give me the bag.
It's not really necessary, but I appreciate it.
What?
What?
This is all you, man.
Shot's no good.
What are you talking about?
You got a clear sight line to...
The shot's no good.
I'm thinking of asking Callie to marry me.
Seriously?
Oh, deer.
Why would you say that?
Callie's a great girl.
No.
Deer!
Oh, no!
So, do you think she'll say yes?
♪ I wish that I knew what I know now ♪
♪ When I was younger ♪
♪ I wish that I knew what I know now ♪
♪ When I was stronger. ♪
Why are you dressed like that?
Aren't you going to work?
No, i'm not.
It's jeff day...
A day for me to stay home and enjoy the peace and quiet
Without the constant yammering of my wife...
Duchess von yammer-steen.
- What do you say when I'm not here?
- What do you want?
I called you a duchess.
- Yeah, I'm flattered.
- I wake up to you.
I go to work with people.
I come home to you.
It's a lot of human contact.
- You're gonna be such a great dad.
- So why are you all dressed up?
For jeff day?
- No.
I start my new job today.
We talked about it for an hour last night at dinner,
While you two were arguing
Over the best way to eat spaghetti.
- Classic twirl on the spoon.
- No, cutting it up is easier.
- If you're six.
- Oh, my god!
- So what's the new job?
- Okay, once again...
I'm running the office for a new website.
They review video games and expose shortcuts.
They just got a bunch of money from a venture capital--
- Wrap it up.
You're losing him.
- Yeah, well...
The exciting part is that I'm in on the ground floor.
So if it becomes huge, I'll be on top.
- Hey, congratulations.
I heard audrey's gonna be on top when it's huge.
That's terrific.
- You know what?
I don't need this abuse, not today.
- Oh, right, I almost forgot!
It's a big day.
- Thank you--
- Happy jeff day!
- Happy jeff day to you too.
- All right.
- You know, happy jeff day to us all.
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.
- Hey, I was just talking to my mom--
Are you eating my leftover pasta?
- Yeah.
I feel like I owe jeff's twirling system
Another chance.
And you know what?
I think he's right.
I learn so much from that guy.
- Anyway, do you remember that little chapel on the lake
Where my parents got married?
- Is me remembering crucial to the story?
- No.
- Continue.
- It's usually booked, like, two years in advance,
But my mom just said they had an opening this summer.
- Is this that place that rents the jet skis?
- Yes.
- Okay.
I remember now.
- So what do you think?
- I love jet skis.
- No, I meant the chapel.
I mean, should we reserve it?
- [stammers] what do you think?
- Well, it's a little sooner than we planned, but...
I always dreamed of getting married there
When I was a little girl.
- Oh, well, that didn't work out.
But, honey, you can still get married there as a grown-up.
- Really?
- Sure.
- [squeals] - [laughs]
- Oh, thanks.
It's gonna be so great.
- It's gonna be great.
- Hey, honey, I'm home.
What's that?
You're not?
I'm alone?
Couch, I believe you know buttocks.
Ah.
- Hi.
Good morning, tug.
Hi, barry.
- You're that woman from last week.
- Yes, audrey bingham.
- You, my lady, are most assuredly the bearer
Of the good morning's tidings.
- Barry, barry.
We're not doing that anymore.
- How's it going?
- Great.
Anyway, I know you guys weren't expecting me this early,
But I figured I'd get in and hit the ground running.
So where's my office?
- Ah, I know not, my fair-- - dude!
- I don't know.
- Oh.
I have an idea for your office.
- I--he's an idiot!
[knock at door]
Ah...
Come on, any other day.
Yes?
- Is audrey home?
I have exciting news about our wedding.
- No, she started work today.
- Oh, I forgot.
- So, um...
- Don't you want to hear the news?
- I wish I could.
It's jeff day.
Nothing from the outside world is allowed.
- But I was just--
- Jeff day.
Sorry, I don't make the rules.
- [exhales deeply] timmy.
- Oh, dear, mr.
Rhodes, your eye.
- I know, right?
It's been twitching.
- Huh.
Did you get something in it?
- It might have been jen's perfume.
- Oh.
You were standing too close to her
When she was spraying it.
- No.
I did.
I ran out of deodorant.
- All right.
Heading out for my lunch date with annabel.
Nice face.
- I think I got something in my eye.
- No, not you.
I'm talking to lawrence of a-gay-bia over here.
Hey, can you snag my dry cleaning and, uh,
Rinse out those teeth-whitening trays.
- Very well.
- And think of some fresh insults
For me to lob your way.
That a-gay-bia thing...
You're better than that.
Auf-wiener-sehen.
- How do you put up with him?
- Oh, I have my coping mechanisms.
For example, I have a strong feeling
His lunch date is not going to go as planned.
- Hmm.
How do you know?
- Well, I do my best to endure mr.
Dunbar's abuses,
But there was an incident the other day
Which was the last straw.
- [chuckles]
Why do you have a toy elephant?
- Ah, it's not a toy.
It's a birthday gift from my grandmother.
- Ah, can I see?
Look, I'm dumbo!
- Sir, please, please, sir--
- Whee, whee, whee!
- Please be careful with that.
- Ha.
It's, uh, not dumbo, I guess.
- I struggled to control my outrage.
Then opportunity rang.
[phone rings] [exhales deeply]
Russell dunbar's office.
Oh, hello, crystal.
Well, he just left, but, uh...
I'm sure he'll understand if you're running a little late.
Okay.
You know--oh!
As luck would have it,
He's just walked right back in.
Shall I put him on the phone for you?
Okay.
I'll do that, then.
[imitating russell] crystal!
Hey, listen...
I've been looking forward to having me crystal ball...
But I kind of have to bail.
Yeah, look, it's tricky.
Mm-hmm.
Turns out, this big thing came up at work.
Heh heh.
Big thing, came up.
You get it.
Well, auf-wiener-sehen.
- Dude, that's unbelievable, man.
You are like that evil puppet master from pinocchio.
- Stromboli?
- No, thanks.
I just crushed some pasta.
[cell phone rings]
- Hey.
Jeff, I'm glad you called.
Listen, I don't know about this job.
This whole place seems like a frat house.
My desk is still sticky
From last night's beer bong tournament.
- Aud, please.
I got a real problem here.
- Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
Go ahead.
- What's that cheese I like?
- What?
- I'm making an omelet.
I got the sour cream, the bacon, the sausage.
But there are three different cheeses here.
- All right, let me see.
Which one could it be?
- Not so easy, is it?
- Ah, nerts!
- What's the matter, sir?
- That chick flaked on me.
This keeps happening.
I don't know what's going on.
- Oh, perhaps they finally aired your episode
Of to catch a predator.
- Hoo-hoo.
Very funny.
Hey, where's that new list of insults?
Come on.
"i'll be in my office,
Tan-dorky chicken."
Oh!
You're tan, you're dorky,
And you're chicken-like.
[laughs]
That's pretty good.
You see, a good boss pushes you to be better.
- [sighs]
Dear god, it's gotten worse.
- I know, right?
I-I don't understand what could be causing this.
- Well, you know, sometimes these things are stress-related.
Mr. Rhodes,
You are familiar with stress, aren't you?
- Oh, I got to be honest, tim.
Up until now, I've had it pretty good.
- I see.
Well, um, is there anything new
In your life that could be causing you undue stress?
- Jen and I moved up our wedding date.
- Aha.
I believe this could be a reaction to that.
- But I'm fine with it.
- Maybe your eye is your subconscious' way
Of telling you you're not.
- If my subconscious was pulling a stunt like that,
I think I'd know about it.
- Ah.
- We're still 2 1/4 short.
I'm not sure we're gonna be able to do this.
- Hey, what are you guys working on?
Maybe I can help.
- If we raise 1,000 bucks,
Tug will eat this whole tub of mayo.
- Okay, uh...
I was hired to be project manager,
Which sort of implies I'd have something to do.
- Well, there's this project that we've been kicking around,
But, uh, it'd be huge if you'd take it on for us.
- Yeah, yeah, whatever it is, I'm on it.
Yes, I am looking for a mint-condition,
Unopened box of mr.
T cereal.
Yes, I'll hold.
Yes, I'm still here.
Still looking for a box of mr.
T cereal.
Look, I just need one box-- [cell phone rings]
I'm sorry.
Can you hold?
What now, jeff?
- Espn's showing the '94 cup finals.
I can't find my ranger shirt.
- I can't help you right now, okay?
I'm trying to track down a box of mr.
T breakfast cereal!
Well, I pity myself right now too.
[knock at door] - hold on for a sec.
Oh, hi, yoli.
- Hola, mr.
Jeff.
- What's the cleaning lady doing here?
- Oh, I forgot.
She switched days this week.
- It's jeff day.
- She's from el salvador.
They don't celebrate jeff day.
- Okay, this is getting weird.
I just got off the phone with annabel,
Who swears I was the one that canceled our date.
- Huh.
That is weird.
- I think someone's messing with me.
- Whosoever would mess with you, sir?
- [grunting] yeah.
Can't be her boyfriend.
He's in afghanistan.
- Sir, if you're not
Time magazine's man of the year,
I'm canceling my subscription.
- Wait a minute, timmy.
You're the one.
- Excuse me?
- You're the one
That can help me get to the bottom of this.
- Sir...
Rest assured, I will not sleep
Until I find the culprit.
- All right, tim.
I knew I could count on you.
- Mm-hmm.
[breathes deeply]
Oh...
Culprit found.
- Working hard, huh?
You want?
Okay, more for me.
Hey.
That's my shirt.
Where did you get that?
- ÿque?
- Audrey gave that to you, didn't she?
She didn't ask me first.
I need that back.
- Miss audrey here?
- No.
No miss audrey today.
Por favor...
You give shirt to me.
You do this.
Now you.
- Mr. Jeff, estoy muy incomoda.
- Look, that shirt only cost me 12 bucks
In 1994 dollars, so...
Here's 20...
You give me 8 back.
- No puedo!
No puedo!
No puedo!
- How about 5 back?
- Honey?
Honey, we need to talk.
- What's up with the sunglasses?
- We have got a big problem.
I love you, and I want to marry you whenever you want,
But right now my subconscious totally disagrees.
It's being a real douche.
- What are you talking about?
- This, - oh, my god!
- I know, I know, I know.
Look, it--it's stress.
It started happening
When you told me about the jet ski chapel.
But, listen, I can live with this if you can, okay?
And I know my looks are what you like most,
But I swear to you,
I will develop my personality more.
- Adam, calm down.
- No, honey.
I'm gonna start reading things,
And I'm--I'm gonna learn current events--
- Babe, this doesn't look like stress.
I-it looks like some sort of allergic reaction.
- Honey, I wish!
The only thing I'm allergic to are pine nuts and bees.
- Wait.
You ate my pasta this morning.
- Oh, my g-- I said I was sorry, okay?
Look, I think we have a bigger issue here!
- No, you said you were allergic to pine nuts and bees.
My pasta that you ate this morning had pesto on it,
And guess what pesto's made with.
Here's a hint.
It's not bees.
- Pine nuts.
Oh, that's hysterical.
Timmy's an idiot.
I knew I didn't have a subconscious.
Oh, what a relief.
- That was fast, audrey.
You really came through on the mr.
T project.
- [chuckles] well, congratulations, guys.
$500 well spent.
- Awesome.
- All right...
So you see I'm up to a challenge.
What else can I do?
- I don't know.
Take a break.
- No.
I don't want to do that, okay?
I just took a break for four months.
- Oh, gosh, I wish we could do that.
- You are doing that.
- I know it looks like that,
But there's work going on up here.
This is all our process, audrey.
- Okay, okay, fine, but while you're doing your process,
A lot of stuff is not getting done, all right?
Look, unopened letters and messages
From potential clients and advertisers...
All here in this box marked...
"who cares."
I could be dealing with all this stuff--
Setting up meetings, getting ad revenue,
Helping you guys grow your business.
- [mouth full] okay, do that.
- What?
- Yeah, yeah, you do all that stuff,
And we'll just do the website.
- All right.
This is great.
I am your girl.
You guys can count on me.
I'm gonna get started right away.
[cell phone rings]
Oh, excuse me.
[clears throat]
Hello?
Oh, yoli.
C-calm down.
My cleaning lady's freaking out in spanish.
- Oh!
I speak spanish.
- Oh, oh.
- Digame.
Mm-hmm.
Si.
- What is she saying?
- She locked herself in the bathroom
Because your husband offered her $20
To take her shirt off.
- So I'm gonna go...
And, uh, I'm gonna get started first thing tomorrow morning.
Okay?
Early bird and all that.
[watch beeps]
- Ooh!
Bap-beep-boop-beep!
[imitating russell] hey, tanya.
It's russell-- applause.
- Who did you say this is?
- Russell...
Dunbar.
Uh, look, I know we're supposed to meet up
And get down...
Wink.
But here's the sitch.
- What's the sitch?
- Um, it's you?
- Bad news--
Got to cancel.
Good news--
I'm at the airport.
I'm taking virgin to london,
And we're flying on...
A-delta!
- Wait.
Who is this?
- Uh, who is this?
- Russell dunbar.
- Uh...
No, this is, uh, russell dunbar.
- Timmy?
- Nerts!
A-click.
- Well, it took a lot of charades,
But I managed to convince yoli
That you're just an idiot.
That seems to translate in any language.
- Good stuff, aud.
Thanks.
Now, if you and your amiga will hit the bricks, 'cause, uh...
There's still 45 minutes left in jeff--
- Oh, seriously?
When charges are almost filed, jeff day's over.
Oh, here's your shirt.
Hope you enjoy it.
She was pretty upset.
I had to sweeten the pot.
- Adios, mrs.
Audrey.
No es meaning no!
- I just don't get it, tim...
After all I've done for you.
- I think you mean to me.
- What, a little good-natured ribbing?
- Sir, you called a cherished family heirloom dumbo
And then shattered it.
- [laughs] yeah, stuff like that!
That's fun stuff guys do!
[cell phone rings] - excuse me, one moment please.
- What?
- Hello, there, laura.
How are you?
- Laura?
- Yes, I'm kind of in--
- Wait a second.
Payback time.
[clears throat] [cockney accent] 'ello, 'ello, laura!
It's timmy!
Listen, I have to break our date today
On account of I fancy the chaps.
That's right, I do.
I'm a homosexual, I am.
Here comes me mate ian, and I'm gonna go kiss him.
Cheerio.
[normal voice] bang.
There ya go.
Two can play that game.
- Yes, pity.
How shall I ever explain this to my dental hygienist?
Why are you dressed like that?
Aren't you going to work?
No, i'm not.
It's jeff day...
A day for me to stay home and enjoy the peace and quiet
Without the constant yammering of my wife...
Duchess von yammer-steen.
What do you say when I'm not here?
What do you want?
I called you a duchess.
Yeah, I'm flattered.
I wake up to you.
I go to work with people.
I come home to you.
It's a lot of human contact.
You're gonna be such a great dad.
So why are you all dressed up?
For jeff day?
No.
I start my new job today.
We talked about it for an hour last night at dinner,
While you two were arguing
Over the best way to eat spaghetti.
Classic twirl on the spoon.
No, cutting it up is easier.
- If you're six.
- Oh, my god!
So what's the new job?
Okay, once again...
I'm running the office for a new website.
They review video games and expose shortcuts.
They just got a bunch of money from a venture capital--
Wrap it up.
You're losing him.
Yeah, well...
The exciting part is that I'm in on the ground floor.
So if it becomes huge, I'll be on top.
Hey, congratulations.
I heard audrey's gonna be on top when it's huge.
That's terrific.
You know what?
I don't need this abuse, not today.
Oh, right, I almost forgot!
It's a big day.
Thank you--
Happy jeff day!
- Happy jeff day to you too.
- All right.
You know, happy jeff day to us all.
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.
Hey, I was just talking to my mom--
Are you eating my leftover pasta?
Yeah.
I feel like I owe jeff's twirling system
Another chance.
And you know what?
I think he's right.
I learn so much from that guy.
Anyway, do you remember that little chapel on the lake
Where my parents got married?
Is me remembering crucial to the story?
No.
Continue.
It's usually booked, like, two years in advance,
But my mom just said they had an opening this summer.
Is this that place that rents the jet skis?
Yes.
Okay.
I remember now.
So what do you think?
I love jet skis.
No, I meant the chapel.
I mean, should we reserve it?
what do you think?
Well, it's a little sooner than we planned, but...
I always dreamed of getting married there
When I was a little girl.
Oh, well, that didn't work out.
But, honey, you can still get married there as a grown-up.
- Really?
- Sure.
Oh, thanks.
It's gonna be so great.
It's gonna be great.
Hey, honey, I'm home.
What's that?
You're not?
I'm alone?
Couch, I believe you know buttocks.
Ah.
Hi.
Good morning, tug.
Hi, barry.
You're that woman from last week.
Yes, audrey bingham.
You, my lady, are most assuredly the bearer
Of the good morning's tidings.
Barry, barry.
We're not doing that anymore.
How's it going?
Great.
Anyway, I know you guys weren't expecting me this early,
But I figured I'd get in and hit the ground running.
So where's my office?
- Ah, I know not, my fair-- - dude!
I don't know.
Oh.
I have an idea for your office.
I--he's an idiot!
Ah...
Come on, any other day.
- Yes?
- Is audrey home?
I have exciting news about our wedding.
- No, she started work today.
- Oh, I forgot.
So, um...
Don't you want to hear the news?
I wish I could.
It's jeff day.
Nothing from the outside world is allowed.
But I was just--
Jeff day.
Sorry, I don't make the rules.
timmy.
Oh, dear, mr.
Rhodes, your eye.
I know, right?
It's been twitching.
Huh.
Did you get something in it?
It might have been jen's perfume.
Oh.
You were standing too close to her
When she was spraying it.
No.
I did.
I ran out of deodorant.
All right.
Heading out for my lunch date with annabel.
Nice face.
I think I got something in my eye.
No, not you.
I'm talking to lawrence of a-gay-bia over here.
Hey, can you snag my dry cleaning and, uh,
Rinse out those teeth-whitening trays.
Very well.
And think of some fresh insults
For me to lob your way.
That a-gay-bia thing...
You're better than that.
Auf-wiener-sehen.
How do you put up with him?
Oh, I have my coping mechanisms.
For example, I have a strong feeling
His lunch date is not going to go as planned.
Hmm.
How do you know?
Well, I do my best to endure mr.
Dunbar's abuses,
But there was an incident the other day
Which was the last straw.
Why do you have a toy elephant?
Ah, it's not a toy.
It's a birthday gift from my grandmother.
Ah, can I see?
- Look, I'm dumbo!
- Sir, please, please, sir--
- Whee, whee, whee!
- Please be careful with that.
Ha.
It's, uh, not dumbo, I guess.
I struggled to control my outrage.
Then opportunity rang.
Russell dunbar's office.
Oh, hello, crystal.
Well, he just left, but, uh...
I'm sure he'll understand if you're running a little late.
Okay.
You know--oh!
As luck would have it,
He's just walked right back in.
Shall I put him on the phone for you?
Okay.
I'll do that, then.
crystal!
Hey, listen...
I've been looking forward to having me crystal ball...
But I kind of have to bail.
Yeah, look, it's tricky.
Mm-hmm.
Turns out, this big thing came up at work.
Heh heh.
Big thing, came up.
You get it.
Well, auf-wiener-sehen.
Dude, that's unbelievable, man.
You are like that evil puppet master from pinocchio.
Stromboli?
No, thanks.
I just crushed some pasta.
Hey.
Jeff, I'm glad you called.
Listen, I don't know about this job.
This whole place seems like a frat house.
My desk is still sticky
From last night's beer bong tournament.
Aud, please.
I got a real problem here.
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
Go ahead.
What's that cheese I like?
What?
I'm making an omelet.
I got the sour cream, the bacon, the sausage.
But there are three different cheeses here.
All right, let me see.
Which one could it be?
Not so easy, is it?
Ah, nerts!
What's the matter, sir?
That chick flaked on me.
This keeps happening.
I don't know what's going on.
Oh, perhaps they finally aired your episode
Of to catch a predator.
Hoo-hoo.
Very funny.
Hey, where's that new list of insults?
Come on.
"i'll be in my office,
Tan-dorky chicken."
Oh!
You're tan, you're dorky,
And you're chicken-like.
That's pretty good.
You see, a good boss pushes you to be better.
Dear god, it's gotten worse.
I know, right?
I-I don't understand what could be causing this.
Well, you know, sometimes these things are stress-related.
Mr. Rhodes,
You are familiar with stress, aren't you?
Oh, I got to be honest, tim.
Up until now, I've had it pretty good.
I see.
Well, um, is there anything new
In your life that could be causing you undue stress?
Jen and I moved up our wedding date.
Aha.
I believe this could be a reaction to that.
But I'm fine with it.
Maybe your eye is your subconscious' way
Of telling you you're not.
If my subconscious was pulling a stunt like that,
I think I'd know about it.
Ah.
We're still 2 1/4 short.
I'm not sure we're gonna be able to do this.
Hey, what are you guys working on?
- Maybe I can help.
- If we raise 1,000 bucks,
Tug will eat this whole tub of mayo.
Okay, uh...
I was hired to be project manager,
Which sort of implies I'd have something to do.
Well, there's this project that we've been kicking around,
But, uh, it'd be huge if you'd take it on for us.
Yeah, yeah, whatever it is, I'm on it.
Yes, I am looking for a mint-condition,
Unopened box of mr.
T cereal.
Yes, I'll hold.
Yes, I'm still here.
Still looking for a box of mr.
T cereal.
Look, I just need one box--
I'm sorry.
Can you hold?
What now, jeff?
Espn's showing the '94 cup finals.
I can't find my ranger shirt.
I can't help you right now, okay?
I'm trying to track down a box of mr.
T breakfast cereal!
Well, I pity myself right now too.
hold on for a sec.
i
- Oh, hi, yoli.
- Hola, mr.
Jeff.
What's the cleaning lady doing here?
Oh, I forgot.
She switched days this week.
It's jeff day.
She's from el salvador.
They don't celebrate jeff day.
Okay, this is getting weird.
I just got off the phone with annabel,
Who swears I was the one that canceled our date.
Huh.
That is weird.
I think someone's messing with me.
Whosoever would mess with you, sir?
yeah.
Can't be her boyfriend.
He's in afghanistan.
Sir, if you're not
Time magazine's man of the year,
I'm canceling my subscription.
Wait a minute, timmy.
You're the one.
Excuse me?
You're the one
That can help me get to the bottom of this.
Sir...
Rest assured, I will not sleep
Until I find the culprit.
All right, tim.
- I knew I could count on you.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh...
Culprit found.
Working hard, huh?
You want?
Okay, more for me.
Hey.
That's my shirt.
i
- Where did you get that?
- ÿque?
Audrey gave that to you, didn't she?
She didn't ask me first.
I need that back.
Miss audrey here?
No.
No miss audrey today.
Por favor...
You give shirt to me.
You do this.
Now you.
Mr. Jeff, estoy muy incomoda.
Look, that shirt only cost me 12 bucks
In 1994 dollars, so...
Here's 20...
You give me 8 back.
No puedo!
No puedo!
No puedo!
How about 5 back?
Honey?
Honey, we need to talk.
What's up with the sunglasses?
We have got a big problem.
I love you, and I want to marry you whenever you want,
But right now my subconscious totally disagrees.
It's being a real douche.
What are you talking about?
- This, - oh, my god!
I know, I know, I know.
Look, it--it's stress.
It started happening
When you told me about the jet ski chapel.
But, listen, I can live with this if you can, okay?
And I know my looks are what you like most,
But I swear to you,
I will develop my personality more.
- Adam, calm down.
- No, honey.
I'm gonna start reading things,
And I'm--I'm gonna learn current events--
Babe, this doesn't look like stress.
I-it looks like some sort of allergic reaction.
Honey, I wish!
The only thing I'm allergic to are pine nuts and bees.
Wait.
You ate my pasta this morning.
Oh, my g-
- I said I was sorry, okay?
Look, I think we have a bigger issue here!
No, you said you were allergic to pine nuts and bees.
My pasta that you ate this morning had pesto on it,
And guess what pesto's made with.
Here's a hint.
It's not bees.
Pine nuts.
Oh, that's hysterical.
Timmy's an idiot.
I knew I didn't have a subconscious.
Oh, what a relief.
That was fast, audrey.
You really came through on the mr.
T project.
well, congratulations, guys.
$500 well spent.
- Awesome.
- All right...
So you see I'm up to a challenge.
- What else can I do?
- I don't know.
Take a break.
No.
I don't want to do that, okay?
I just took a break for four months.
Oh, gosh, I wish we could do that.
You are doing that.
I know it looks like that,
But there's work going on up here.
This is all our process, audrey.
Okay, okay, fine, but while you're doing your process,

Well, auf-wiener-sehen.
Dude, that's unbelievable, man.
You are like that evil puppet master from pinocchio.
Stromboli?
No, thanks.
I just crushed some pasta.
Hey.
Jeff, I'm glad you called.
Listen, I don't know about this job.
This whole place seems like a frat house.
My desk is still sticky
From last night's beer bong tournament.
Aud, please.
I got a real problem here.
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
Go ahead.
What's that cheese I like?
What?
I'm making an omelet.
I got the sour cream, the bacon, the sausage.
But there are three different cheeses here.
All right, let me see.
Which one could it be?
Not so easy, is it?
Ah, nerts!
What's the matter, sir?
That chick flaked on me.
This keeps happening.
I don't know what's going on.
Oh, perhaps they finally aired your episode
Of to catch a predator.
Hoo-hoo.
Very funny.
Hey, where's that new list of insults?
Come on.
"i'll be in my office,
Tan-dorky chicken."
Oh!
You're tan, you're dorky,
And you're chicken-like.
That's pretty good.
You see, a good boss pushes you to be better.
Dear god, it's gotten worse.
I know, right?
I-I don't understand what could be causing this.
Well, you know, sometimes these things are stress-related.
Mr. Rhodes,
You are familiar with stress, aren't you?
Oh, I got to be honest, tim.
Up until now, I've had it pretty good.
I see.
Well, um, is there anything new
In your life that could be causing you undue stress?
Jen and I moved up our wedding date.
Aha.
I believe this could be a reaction to that.
But I'm fine with it.
Maybe your eye is your subconscious' way
Of telling you you're not.
If my subconscious was pulling a stunt like that,
I think I'd know about it.
Ah.
We're still 2 1/4 short.
I'm not sure we're gonna be able to do this.
Hey, what are you guys working on?
- Maybe I can help.
- If we raise 1,000 bucks,
Tug will eat this whole tub of mayo.
Okay, uh...
I was hired to be project manager,
Which sort of implies I'd have something to do.
Well, there's this project that we've been kicking around,
But, uh, it'd be huge if you'd take it on for us.
Yeah, yeah, whatever it is, I'm on it.
Yes, I am looking for a mint-condition,
Unopened box of mr.
T cereal.
Yes, I'll hold.
Yes, I'm still here.
Still looking for a box of mr.
T cereal.
Look, I just need one box--
I'm sorry.
Can you hold?
What now, jeff?
Espn's showing the '94 cup finals.
I can't find my ranger shirt.
I can't help you right now, okay?
I'm trying to track down a box of mr.
T breakfast cereal!
Well, I pity myself right now too.
hold on for a sec.
i
- Oh, hi, yoli.
- Hola, mr.
Jeff.
What's the cleaning lady doing here?
Oh, I forgot.
She switched days this week.
It's jeff day.
She's from el salvador.
They don't celebrate jeff day.
Okay, this is getting weird.
I just got off the phone with annabel,
Who swears I was the one that canceled our date.
Huh.
That is weird.
I think someone's messing with me.
Whosoever would mess with you, sir?
yeah.
Can't be her boyfriend.
He's in afghanistan.
Sir, if you're not
Time magazine's man of the year,
I'm canceling my subscription.
Wait a minute, timmy.
You're the one.
Excuse me?
You're the one
That can help me get to the bottom of this.
Sir...
Rest assured, I will not sleep
Until I find the culprit.
All right, tim.
- I knew I could count on you.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh...
Culprit found.
Working hard, huh?
You want?
Okay, more for me.
Hey.
That's my shirt.
i
- Where did you get that?
- ÿque?
Audrey gave that to you, didn't she?
She didn't ask me first.
I need that back.
Miss audrey here?
No.
No miss audrey today.
Por favor...
You give shirt to me.
You do this.
Now you.
Mr. Jeff, estoy muy incomoda.
Look, that shirt only cost me 12 bucks
In 1994 dollars, so...
Here's 20...
You give me 8 back.
No puedo!
No puedo!
No puedo!
How about 5 back?
Honey?
Honey, we need to talk.
What's up with the sunglasses?
We have got a big problem.
I love you, and I want to marry you whenever you want,
But right now my subconscious totally disagrees.
It's being a real douche.
What are you talking about?
- This, - oh, my god!
I know, I know, I know.
Look, it--it's stress.
It started happening
When you told me about the jet ski chapel.
But, listen, I can live with this if you can, okay?
And I know my looks are what you like most,
But I swear to you,
I will develop my personality more.
- Adam, calm down.
- No, honey.
I'm gonna start reading things,
And I'm--I'm gonna learn current events--
Babe, this doesn't look like stress.
I-it looks like some sort of allergic reaction.
Honey, I wish!
The only thing I'm allergic to are pine nuts and bees.
Wait.
You ate my pasta this morning.
Oh, my g-
- I said I was sorry, okay?
Look, I think we have a bigger issue here!
No, you said you were allergic to pine nuts and bees.
My pasta that you ate this morning had pesto on it,
And guess what pesto's made with.
Here's a hint.
It's not bees.
Pine nuts.
Oh, that's hysterical.
Timmy's an idiot.
I knew I didn't have a subconscious.
Oh, what a relief.
That was fast, audrey.
You really came through on the mr.
T project.
well, congratulations, guys.
$500 well spent.
- Awesome.
- All right...
So you see I'm up to a challenge.
- What else can I do?
- I don't know.
Take a break.
No.
I don't want to do that, okay?
I just took a break for four months.
Oh, gosh, I wish we could do that.
You are doing that.
I know it looks like that,
But there's work going on up here.
This is all our process, audrey.
Okay, okay, fine, but while you're doing your process,
A lot of stuff is not getting done, all right?
Look, unopened letters and messages
From potential clients and advertisers...
All here in this box marked...
"who cares."
I could be dealing with all this stuff--
Setting up meetings, getting ad revenue,
Helping you guys grow your business.
okay, do that.
What?
Yeah, yeah, you do all that stuff,
- And we'll just do the website.
- All right.
This is great.
I am your girl.
You guys can count on me.
I'm gonna get started right away.
Oh, excuse me.
Hello?
Oh, yoli.
C-calm down.
My cleaning lady's freaking out in spanish.
- Oh!
I speak spanish.
- Oh, oh.
Digame.
Mm-hmm.
Si.
What is she saying?
She locked herself in the bathroom
Because your husband offered her $20
To take her shirt off.
So I'm gonna go...
And, uh, I'm gonna get started first thing tomorrow morning.
Okay?
Early bird and all that.
Ooh!
Bap-beep-boop-beep!
hey, tanya.
It's russell-- applause.
- Who did you say this is?
- Russell...
Dunbar.
Uh, look, I know we're supposed to meet up
And get down...
Wink.
But here's the sitch.
- What's the sitch?
- Um, it's you?
Bad news--
Got to cancel.
Good news--
I'm at the airport.
I'm taking virgin to london,
And we're flying on...
A-delta!
Wait.
Who is this?
Uh, who is this?
Russell dunbar.
Uh...
No, this is, uh, russell dunbar.
Timmy?
Nerts!
A-click.
Well, it took a lot of charades,
But I managed to convince yoli
That you're just an idiot.
That seems to translate in any language.
Good stuff, aud.
Thanks.
Now, if you and your amiga will hit the bricks, 'cause, uh...
There's still 45 minutes left in jeff--
Oh, seriously?
When charges are almost filed, jeff day's over.
Oh, here's your shirt.
Hope you enjoy it.
She was pretty upset.
I had to sweeten the pot.
Adios, mrs.
Audrey.
No es meaning no!
I just don't get it, tim...
After all I've done for you.
I think you mean to me.
What, a little good-natured ribbing?
Sir, you called a cherished family heirloom dumbo
And then shattered it.
yeah, stuff like that!
That's fun stuff guys do!
excuse me, one moment please.
What?
Hello, there, laura.
How are you?
- Laura?
- Yes, I'm kind of in--
Wait a second.
Payback time.
'ello, 'ello, laura!
It's timmy!
Listen, I have to break our date today
On account of I fancy the chaps.
That's right, I do.
I'm a homosexual, I am.
Here comes me mate ian, and I'm gonna go kiss him.
Cheerio.
bang.
There ya go.
Two can play that game.
Yes, pity.
How shall I ever explain this to my dental hygienist?
Why are you dressed like that?
Aren't you going to work?
No, i'm not.
It's jeff day...
A day for me to stay home and enjoy the peace and quiet
Without the constant yammering of my wife...
Duchess von yammer-steen.
What do you say when I'm not here?
What do you want?
I called you a duchess.
Yeah, I'm flattered.
I wake up to you.
I go to work with people.
I come home to you.
It's a lot of human contact.
You're gonna be such a great dad.
So why are you all dressed up?
For jeff day?
No.
I start my new job today.
We talked about it for an hour last night at dinner,
While you two were arguing
Over the best way to eat spaghetti.
Classic twirl on the spoon.
No, cutting it up is easier.
- If you're six.
- Oh, my god!
So what's the new job?
Okay, once again...
I'm running the office for a new website.
They review video games and expose shortcuts.
They just got a bunch of money from a venture capital--
Wrap it up.
You're losing him.
Yeah, well...
The exciting part is that I'm in on the ground floor.
So if it becomes huge, I'll be on top.
Hey, congratulations.
I heard audrey's gonna be on top when it's huge.
That's terrific.
You know what?
I don't need this abuse, not today.
Oh, right, I almost forgot!
It's a big day.
Thank you--
Happy jeff day!
- Happy jeff day to you too.
- All right.
You know, happy jeff day to us all.
Hey, I was just talking to my mom--
Are you eating my leftover pasta?
Yeah.
I feel like I owe jeff's twirling system
Another chance.
And you know what?
I think he's right.
I learn so much from that guy.
Anyway, do you remember that little chapel on the lake
Where my parents got married?
Is me remembering crucial to the story?
No.
Continue.
It's usually booked, like, two years in advance,
But my mom just said they had an opening this summer.
Is this that place that rents the jet skis?
Yes.
Okay.
I remember now.
So what do you think?
I love jet skis.
No, I meant the chapel.
I mean, should we reserve it?
what do you think?
Well, it's a little sooner than we planned, but...
I always dreamed of getting married there
When I was a little girl.
Oh, well, that didn't work out.
But, honey, you can still get married there as a grown-up.
- Really?
- Sure.
Oh, thanks.
It's gonna be so great.
It's gonna be great.
Hey, honey, I'm home.
What's that?
You're not?
I'm alone?
Couch, I believe you know buttocks.
Ah.
Hi.
Good morning, tug.
Hi, barry.
You're that woman from last week.
Yes, audrey bingham.
You, my lady, are most assuredly the bearer
Of the good morning's tidings.
Barry, barry.
We're not doing that anymore.
How's it going?
Great.
Anyway, I know you guys weren't expecting me this early,
But I figured I'd get in and hit the ground running.
So where's my office?
- Ah, I know not, my fair-- - dude!
I don't know.
Oh.
I have an idea for your office.
I--he's an idiot!
Ah...
Come on, any other day.
- Yes?
- Is audrey home?
I have exciting news about our wedding.
- No, she started work today.
- Oh, I forgot.
So, um...
Don't you want to hear the news?
I wish I could.
It's jeff day.
Nothing from the outside world is allowed.
But I was just--
Jeff day.
Sorry, I don't make the rules.
timmy.
Oh, dear, mr.
Rhodes, your eye.
I know, right?
It's been twitching.
Huh.
Did you get something in it?
It might have been jen's perfume.
Oh.
You were standing too close to her
When she was spraying it.
No.
I did.
I ran out of deodorant.
All right.
Heading out for my lunch date with annabel.
Nice face.
I think I got something in my eye.
No, not you.
I'm talking to lawrence of a-gay-bia over here.
Hey, can you snag my dry cleaning and, uh,
Rinse out those teeth-whitening trays.
Very well.
And think of some fresh insults
For me to lob your way.
That a-gay-bia thing...
You're better than that.
Auf-wiener-sehen.
How do you put up with him?
Oh, I have my coping mechanisms.
For example, I have a strong feeling
His lunch date is not going to go as planned.
Hmm.
How do you know?
Well, I do my best to endure mr.
Dunbar's abuses,
But there was an incident the other day
Which was the last straw.
Why do you have a toy elephant?
Ah, it's not a toy.
It's a birthday gift from my grandmother.
Ah, can I see?
- Look, I'm dumbo!
- Sir, please, please, sir--
- Whee, whee, whee!
- Please be careful with that.
Ha.
It's, uh, not dumbo, I guess.
I struggled to control my outrage.
Then opportunity rang.
Russell dunbar's office.
Oh, hello, crystal.
Well, he just left, but, uh...
I'm sure he'll understand if you're running a little late.
Okay.
You know--oh!
As luck would have it,
He's just walked right back in.
Shall I put him on the phone for you?
Okay.
I'll do that, then.
crystal!
Hey, listen...
I've been looking forward to having me crystal ball...
But I kind of have to bail.
Yeah, look, it's tricky.
Mm-hmm.
Turns out, this big thing came up at work.
Heh heh.
Big thing, came up.
You get it.
Well, auf-wiener-sehen.
Dude, that's unbelievable, man.
You are like that evil puppet master from pinocchio.
Stromboli?
No, thanks.
I just crushed some pasta.
Hey.
Jeff, I'm glad you called.
Listen, I don't know about this job.

In a filmmaking career that has spanned over 30 years, my next guest is the man responsible for such cinematic classics as "The House of Usher," "Wild Angels,"
"The Monster from the Ocean Floor,"
"The Attack of the Crab Monsters."
Please welcome Roger Corman.
Low-budget movies in those days- it wasn't like today.
Nobody was really trying to make them good.
There was the real emphasis on the price.
Roger Corman has made more than 200 motion pictures in his career, most of them for extremely low budget.
He's produced around 150-175 films.
He made so many movies.
In 1957, he directed 10 movies.
Most people don't get to do that.
He made 250 movies and never lost a dime.
Okay, this is not a $20-million movie.
You know, this is a $1.93 science fiction movie.
We knew these were made fast and cheap, and we also knew that taste was out of the question.
There was no need for taste.
The way Disney movies, you know, bring out the child in all of us, you know, so can exploitation.
Sometimes he'll give the notes right on the script and you get little marginal references like
"Breast nudity possible here?" Question mark.
The goal was, Roger said, "Every motorcycle that runs,
And then when it stops running, blow it up."
Aah!
He said, "Your job, if the cops come, is to pick up the camera and run."
I said, "We're in the middle of the desert.
What do you mean, there is no water?"
It's a Roger Corman movie, you know.
There's no water.
One take on everything.
That's just the way he worked.
You know, you didn't argue with him.
And we were delighted to be working.
It doesn't matter if people are happy.
It doesn't matter if you have a permit.
None of it matters.
You know, the only thing that counts is what you get inside the frame.
He's still around, making pictures in his 30$ and he's-- I just saw him the other day.
He hasn't changed at all.
One, two, three.
- And action!
One, two, three.
I'm in the water with a giant creature on my arms pumping blood out, chomping on a beautiful girl in a bikini.
I mean, it's the essence of Roger Corman cinema.
We feel that the monster should kill somebody fairly early and then at regular intervals through the picture.
The first kill should be quite shocking.
The other kills can be a little bit less shocking as we build up.
And then of course the climax- everything goes, blood all over the screen.
Roger had made two previous movies for the Syfy channel that did very well for them.
And he said, "Okay, Frances it's 'Dino-shark.'
You know what that is."
And of course I say, "Yes, I know what that is.
It's a giant shark."
"Yes, but not too much like 'Jaws."' "No, of course not."
- 122-Charlie, take three.
- Marker.
"Dinoshark" is about a shark that is unloosed because of global warming from an avalanche north of Alaska...
That's your killer.
It hasn't eaten in 150 million years and it's hungry.
...and somehow mysteriously makes its way south to Puerto Vallarta and pretty much terrorizes everybody and everything in sight.
You know, that whole world is just so different from the "Entertainment Weekly" world or the Academy Award world.
The Golden Globes don't even hear about these things.
You know, these pictures- they just go someplace else.
And there's an incredible number of people that want to see a picture just like this.
The Paradise Village location also had some accommodation for actors and crew and so on.
So that's always been one of those little tricks up Roger's sleeve- how he can do what he does on a budget.
Roger always said, you know, "You could make 'Lawrence of Arabia' for a half a million dollars.
You just don't leave the tent."
If you could imagine
Knott's Berry Farm set on a beach, but the only people in the park were senior citizens, no rides, but it had a theme-park-like atmosphere, that is what we have affectionately dubbed
Paradise Prison.
Who is two minutes from being ready for what?
At first I thought it was maybe some kind of electromagnetic field that doesn't allow the walkie-talkie service.
I need a radio that works.
But it turns out that we just bought, you know, children's walkie-talkies.
This is full-on guerilla-style filmmaking.
I mean, you know, we're sort of running and gunning and stealing locations and driving boats
- where they shouldn't be driven.
- Go, go, go, get out!
Oh, my God.
At one point they wanted somebody to get in this water...
- Action!
- ...to get attacked by something.
Well, it turns out there was actually things to get attacked by.
Not that this wasn't obvious.
There was a giant sign that said "Crocodiles."
Should she be there?
Well, that's where she was in the wide shot.
- The way this will be cut, it'll work.
- Okay.
All right.
You wouldn't think of the movies, if you met him, that he'd have done all these movies- very polite, very-- almost British.
He really came across, I felt, as more like an English film professor, you know.
I expected him to be teaching at Oxford or Cambridge rather than kind of making all of these kind of violent exploitation movies that he had made.
I thought he'd be more like Lee J. Cobb, let's say, or somebody a little-- where they're smoking a cigar and pounding on the desk and--
"You kids get in there and do that work," and, you know-- and actually he's very eloquent, elegant and precise, cool-headed, from what I saw, and very, very different from the type of person
you'd think would be behind these pictures like "Teenage Cave Man."
The difference between the image you present to the world and what is going on inside, in your unconscious mind, is significant.
I've been told that my image is
I'm just sort of an ordinary straight guy.
Clearly my unconscious mind is some sort of a boiling inferno there.
Like most kids, I was interested in films essentially all my life.
I graduated from Stanford University in California in engineering.
I worked four days as an engineer and quit.
The only job I could get in films was a messenger at 20th Century Fox.
And I worked my way up from that to become a story analyst.
I read scripts, commented on them, and handed in a synopsis of the script or the novel or whatever had been proposed with my opinion.
As the youngest reader, I was given frankly the most hopeless scripts to cover.
And the story editor said,
"Roger, you have never recommended one script."
And I said, "You've never given me a script that's worth recommending."
So they sent me a script which was the first thing I'd ever read at Fox that I thought was really any good at all.
And I made a number of notes on it.
The picture became "The Gunfighter" starring Gregory Peck.
And the story editor got a bonus for my notes.
And I got no recognition for the fact that a number of my ideas were used in the script.
This became a big hit for Fox.
You would have thought he would have had some acknowledgment.
This caused him to leave Fox and become what he is today.
After "The Gunfighter,"
he corralled some money from our parents and some of his money and a few friends', got an enormous number of deferments and made his first film-- "Monster from the Ocean Floor."
And that was basically the beginnings of Roger Corman.
I was the producer, the assistant director and everything.
I would drive the truck to the location and unload everything I could by myself.
And I would save about an hour on the crew salary every morning.
The second picture I made was a picture called "The Fast and the Furious."
It was about road racing and of course had very, very little money.
Roger went to some sports car dealerships and borrowed sports cars.
And we took the Windshields off them and actually raced them.
And then we'd clean them up and take them back.
Roger was just so inane at the time and was trying to do it himself and was starting to run out of money.
If you don't understand money in the movie business, it's like an artist who doesn't understand paint.
Roger told me, "Well, I understand paint.
If I got to thin her up with turpentine or there's no picture, why, she gets thinned up a little.
That's all there is to it."
I could see the problem for the independent.
You raised the money.
You made the picture.
And then you had to wait for the picture to earn its money back before you could make another picture.
But Sam Arkoff and Jim Nicholson were starting a new company- American International.
And they made me an offer for "The Fast and the Furious"
to start their company with.
I said, "I want a three-picture deal in which I'm guaranteed my money back.
As soon as I finish one film,
I go to the next one using the guarantee."
And that essentially started me on a regular basis of making films and started American International.
Don't call me "squaw."
You're a dirty apache squaw.
I'm gonna kill you.
Your people did that-- raiding, thieving, killing.
I was very famous for fighting with the girls.
This was "Apache Woman."
Joan Taylor and I did a knife fight in the street.
And this is Dick Miller in the background where he belonged.
A friend of mine, Jonathan Haze, said,
"Well, maybe I'll introduce you to Roger Corman and he can help you."
We went down there.
He said, "What do you do?"
I said, "I'm a writer."
He said, "We don't need any writers right now."
He says, "I need actors." I said, "I'm an actor."
He says, "You want to play an Indian for me?"
At the end I got killed.
Roger said, "How would you like to play a cowboy for me?"
I said, "Oh, are we going to another picture?"
He says, "No, no, this picture."
I said, "Oh, God.
Okay."
I wound up killing myself in the last scene.
I don't know what the budgets were, but they were really low.
We shot them in seven days, so that gives you an idea.
And that's everything, including special effects or anything else, you know.
Some weren't all that great, and Roger'd be the first guy to tell you that.
I never had the opportunity to go to film school.
My student work was being shown on the screen.
And some of it wasn't quite as good as it might have been, but I was learning all the time.
Beat it, I said.
You're on a battlefield.
I know that better than you do, Sergeant.
How well are you doing?
Half my men are dead.
Nothing can stop that thing.
Call off your troops.
It's as if these films were being made on your street corner, in a way.
They weren't encumbered by having to deal with "art"
with a capital A-R-T.
They just weren't-
- I mean, they're art in another way.
I learned fairly quickly how to handle the camera, what to do with editing, but I didn't know enough about acting, and I felt I should simply take a class.
And that was where I met Jack Nicholson.
He came into the class with that little smile, and everybody's as serious as a heart attack, you know.
He had-- when I was first working for him, he told me he had 12 companies, the contracts of which were all in his back pocket.
I mean, he was a one-man band.
Don't make me.
Don't be a fool, kid.
You think I would carry a real gun?
As a matter of fact, the first picture Jack Nicholson starred in was for me-- a picture called "The Cry Baby Killer"
about a kid who takes a drive-in hostage.
It's coming.
Can't you get him to be quiet until it comes?
I hadn't really worked at all before.
Then I got a lead in the movie.
I thought, "Oh, this is it.
I'm here.
I'm gonna be big," you know.
Then I didn't even get an interview for the next year.
Look, Carole was a swell girl until Manny got his hands on her.
You mean, till she wanted Manny's hands on her.
Listen, Fred...
"Cry Baby Killer" was just humiliating but good for me.
Hey, Roger's the only guy who hired me for about 10 years.
Teenagers-- never had 'em when I was a kid.
The word "teenager" didn't really exist until the '50s.
If you look at the '40s and '30s, their idea of a teenage movie was "Andy Hardy."
Hey, Betsy.
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!
What do you think's happened?
- What do you think's happened?
- What?
Well, tell me what.
Cynthia won't go to the dance and I don't know why and I don't want to.
Times were changing.
- Dave!
- Okay, Johnny.
The major studios didn't really understand the audience was looking for a different type of film.
If we were going to make pictures about young people,
I'd have picked a young guy like Jack Nicholson.
But you're through breaking the law.
Sarge, I don't break the law.
I make my own.
Roger really realized that young people at that time really liked movies where teenagers were in trouble with the authorities.
He had found an audience that you didn't have to go through the studio system to reach.
Not only was he a rebel from Hollywood in that he did it all himself and did it outside of the studio system, but there was an edge of rebellion, you know, to the movies.
You make it as disreputable as possible so that the parents wouldn't want them to see it and that they feel that when they go there, they're doing something transgressive, and you've got an audience.
You're making outlaw movies, basically.
And Roger has always been an outlaw.
Let go of me. you big ape!
Now beat it, smart boy, and don't come back or I'll break your head.
Break whose head, you phony Frenchman?
You ain't so tough.
Took this moose-head to throw me out
I've always been anti-establishment.
I spent two years in the Navy.
Those were the worst two years of my life.
I came very close to setting the record for the most demerits, because I felt if they set up a rule,
I really must break that rule.
Roger understood the need for audiences to identify with rebellion.
Beating the system- that's cathartic, you know, defining yourself on your own terms.
These things are elemental.
They're all what we go through during those rites of passage.
I think that he understood that when he was dealing with those basic experiences and feelings that he was talking to a young audience.
We know he always had something up his sleeve.
He was more irreverent.
He was more hip-- very hip, very cool.
"A Bucket of Blood" is a really good example of parody of the hip scene, the beat scene in LA.
Walter, you've done something to me, something deep down inside of my prana.
I have?
Oh, Walter, I want to be with you.
You're creative.
Almost all of Roger's pictures has a little edge to them.
They were-- they just bordered on something sacrosanct, that you shouldn't touch this,
And that's usually what pulled the picture through.
Feed me.
I'm sorry, pal.
I'm fresh out of blood.
Talk to somebody else.
I'm hungry.
I don't care what you are.
Can't you see I'm knocked out?
I just killed a man.
I'm a murderer.
He was always pushing.
Roger's idea at the time was to cut down the time of shooting.
So now his ambition was to make a film in two days.
Now no Novocain.
It dulls the senses.
It was work.
I mean, we would get there early in the morning and we'd just start grinding out these scenes.
One day was half the movie.
Oh, my God, don't stop now.
Roger had borrowed all the dental equipment from his personal dentist and they hadn't bolted it down to the floor.
We banged into this big dental shit and it started to fall over.
And Roger cut the camera and ran out and saved the dental equipment.
To hell with the scene.
I can truly say I've never enjoyed myself so much.
I'd have terrible experiences going into the theater with movies that I had made in that period with Roger, 'cause, you know, they were kind of-- a lot of them were grim.
- Bye.
- Bye now.
By mistake he actually made a good picture every once in a while.
I was never in it, but that was as much my fault as the next guy's.
By the beginning of the '60s
I began to have confidence in my ability to master the craft.
At least she has found peace now.
Has she?
We'd never miss a Poe movie.
They were riveting and stylish and hip and funny.
And we couldn't wait for the next one.
And of course with Roger, you didn't have to wait very long.
The next one was gonna come out, like, a month later.
Do you know where you are, Bartolome?
The pit and the pendulum.
The Poe movies were huge for me, especially "The Pit and the Pendulum."
They had this TV campaign where the blade was coming down, you know, and just kind of-- whew.
And, oh, my God, it was- and I rushed.
In fact, that's probably the first time that a TV campaign made me go to the movie.
They were so successful,
I ended up making six Edgar Allan Poe films.
The artistry of the films really developed into the Poe pictures:
"The House of Usher," "The Pit and the Pendulum,"
and "The Tomb of Ligeia," which is my favorite.
She desecrates the earth in which she lies.
A nervous contraction, nothing more.
He was a name that we'd go like--
I must say like a Hitchcock film.
We'd go see a Roger Corman.
They wanted me to make more, but by that time I said, "Enough.
I'm starting to repeat myself."
We played it for a little bit of humor in some of the later pictures, particularly "The Raven."
I was doing "The Raven."
And he said, "Jack, look, these sets are gonna be up over the weekend, so I can use the same sets for free.
I'm gonna have somebody write something."
And he went and he got a guy who wrote 63 pages of just dialogue.
To this day, no one knows the plot of "The Terror."
It was very strange.
I mean, we played the weirdest characters.
I played a guy that was an assistant to a witch.
In the beginning of the film, I'm a deaf-mute.
And then halfway through the film, they decided that they didn't have an ending for the film.
They'd better make me talk.
I can say no more.
There is great danger.
Find Eric.
Eric knows.
Dick played a livery butler with a New York accent.
And you'll see in the picture now--
God forbid, I don't want to encourage anyone to see it--
I throw Dick Miller up against this door.
Where's the baron?
We must get to him.
He's locked himself in the crypt.
And Dick Miller now tries to explain the entire picture in one speech.
The baron did return that night to find Eric with the baroness and he did kill her.
But there was a struggle, and in the fight it was not Eric who died, but the baron.
I killed the baron.
'Cause there is-- there's no story actually arrived at.
Various directors shot the film.
Francis Coppola started and shot some sequences at Big Sur, but then got an opportunity at a major studio.
Sol had Monte Hellman shoot for a while.
Monte then got another job and I think--
I've forgotten all the directors.
There were four or five directors, including finally Jack Nicholson shot some scenes himself.
And eventually I went in for an hour and shot the final tie-in shots and finished the picture.
It is a somewhat confusing picture.
Oh, man, God.
Hopeless, all of it.
I think he wanted to be taken seriously as a filmmaker monster movies and sci-fi movies.
Perhaps it's not so much that he wanted critical acclaim, but he wanted some depth, some feeling, some reason for making a movie.
I wanted to do something a little bit different.
And I'd read the book "The Intruder,"
which was about the integration of the schools in the South.
And I wanted to make that picture.
I was very much in favor of integration.
I showed the screenplay to American International and said, "This will be my next picture."
To my real surprise, they said they didn't want to make it.
And they'd never said no.
I took it to Allied Artists.
They said no.
Everybody said no, so I said, "All right, I'll make it myself."
So my brother and I produced it in the South.
"He was a leader of men, but he was evil.
He was a stranger, but he brought lust and love, rape and hate to this quiet Southern town.
He was the intruder."
This is not the reason we made this film.
It is the exact opposite of what we intended this film to be.
It was not and is not an exploitation film.
This picture was the first film that Roger could actually make a statement about his personal feelings as opposed to doing the Poe films or the films that were just exploitation, drive-in films.
Playing the lead was the new young actor making his first film-- Bill Shatner.
All I knew was that it was a wonderful part and it was a wonderful opportunity for me at an early point in my career.
The character I played was based on a real person.
He was a white supremacist from New York City and went down into the South to rabble-rouse and tries to stop the integration of a school.
I mean, they've got 10 niggers enrolled already in the school.
And they're starting Monday.
Yes, I know.
Do you think it's right?
No, I sure don't.
Neither does nobody.
But it's the law.
Whose law?
What is difficult for people to understand now--
"separate but equal" was the law of the land.
That meant water fountains, that meant restaurants, it meant schools that were totally segregated.
It was the height of the integration wars.
It became very apparent once we were down there that people held polar opposite views of what was right and what was wrong.
Take it easy, nigger.
You're not going anywhere.
- What's the trouble?
- Are you looking for trouble?
No, sir.
We're on our way to the house.
"Just on our way to the house."
I didn't tell people what the subject matter is, but the title-- "Intruder," you know.
And with the track record of Roger, all the films,
I mean, they naturally thought it was a horror film or something in that genre.
It was only as everything started to unfold and they saw exactly what was happening-
I mean, people were driving us out of locations.
We had to change motels.
I mean, it got to be very heavy down there.
Hey, are you really gonna make him go to the white school tomorrow?
Why, I'm not making him go.
Am I. Joey?
- No, Ma.
- Well, it's too bad I ain't old enough.
I wouldn't be scared, that's all.
Who's scared?
We were having our lives threatened to make a film about integration.
Roger displayed such courage under fire.
And Gene Corman, his brother- such courage to make the film.
There was such animosity and the experience of hatred that I think we realized we had a bigger problem.
I think we were more naive than we should have been at that point in time.
You were alone with a white girl in the basement of the school, but you didn't try to do anything?
Is that what you expect us to believe, nigger?
- Well, speak LIP!
We felt we should definitely expose our audience to this kind of material, because this is what was going on in America and somebody had to say, "Stop.
This is not the American way."
It was a lie-- everything, everything I said about Joey, all of it.
You were gonna kill this boy.
You know it and I know it.
Making films is a dedication.
You have to be possessed.
At some point there, I realized that they had mortgaged their home for that film.
That, perhaps, was the most admirable thing of all, because it's one thing to be cavalier about spending money that isn't yours, but to be so adamant as to put your house on the line,
that's-- that's extraordinary.
We aren't gonna give up now, not now.
No, sir, not ever.
I'd set up the sneak preview with Pacific Theaters.
It was almost a riot in the theater.
People were screaming, "Communist!"
And one of the ushers or one of the people who worked at the theater came up to me, pinned me against the wall, said, "You're a Communist.
You don't belong in this country."
The picture was a wonderful commercial failure.
I started to say "a wonderful critical success,"
but I got confused.
But I'll leave the confusion there because it's all wound up in my mind.
It sort of gets me in the stomach when I talk about it.
This is the only film that I don't think we ever made money on.
And yet it was our best film.
We were ahead of the time.
It made me rethink my method of making pictures.
And I felt the public really is the ultimate arbiter of your film.
If there's something you really want to do-- in Roger's case it's making movies- then you keep on doing it.
Every time you fail, you just keep on.
I thought, I should go back to a more commercial type of film."
I was starting to learn method acting technique.
There was what was known as the text and the subtext.
The text is the written script, what you were saying.
The subtext is what you mean, what you really feel, that causes you to say these words.
And I felt
I should make my subject matter the text, which will be a commercial text, but my theme, my message, what is important to me, should be the subtext, so the audience will get what they paid their money to see.
I think he consciously was looking to contemporary events, news, for inspiration for material to make a movie.
AIP said, "All right, what do you want to make?"
I said, "There's a phenomenon in the country right now-- the Hells Angels, the outlaw motorcycle gangs.
I want to make a picture about the Hells Angels."
And they agreed instantly.
Roger offered me $125 a week to work as his assistant on the picture.
And he said I could take Polly with me.
His reputation was, you know, complicated, because I kept hearing that he was a millionaire.
And I thought he was pretty eccentric, you know, 'cause he didn't live like a millionaire.
But I had little interest in his movies, to be honest, because I was a big snob and I only liked Fritz Lang and Howard Hawks and John Ford.
The star of the picture was George Chakiris who'd won an Oscar for "Westside Story."
The phone rang in my house here in Los Angeles, in Beverly Hills, and it was Roger.
He said, "We have a problem."
I said, "George can't ride." He said, "How do you know?"
I said, "Because I know George.
He can dance, but he can't ride.
You need a biker." "Do you ride?"
I said, "Oh, yeah, Roger, I ride.
I'll do it."
I said, "Who's gonna play my part?"
He said, "Bruce Dem." I said, "Great.
I know Dernsy."
We just had, like, eight actors, and the rest were all extras.
But the extras made the movie, because they had the machines and they were what the movie was about.
And they were real Hells Angels guys.
They were terrible.
They were frightening.
We all rode our bikes down the 2, in the desert.
And he filmed it along the way.
But he didn't get a police escort or anything like that.
He got no permits.
We just did it.
It was the beginning of what you know now as real guerrilla filmmaking.
You know, Roger's a guy who's not gonna miss an opportunity to take advantage of every single thing he can shoot.
At one point, there was supposed to be a kind of a fight between the Hells Angels and the townies.
We didn't have enough townies, so Roger turns to me and he says, "You run in there, be a townie."
So I run in, and within seconds, the Angels were beating the shit out of me.
All I did was go right down to the ground and just prayed for "Cut!"
When work was over, you never saw Roger.
He didn't go to dinner.
He didn't-- you didn't know what he did.
As close as we were to him on that picture, and we were literally his only friends-
I mean, not that nobody liked him, but he was just-- didn't reach out toward friendship.
And he remained mysterious.
But tell me, just what is it that you want to do?
Well, we want to be free.
We want to be free to do what we want to do.
We want to be free to ride.
We want to be free to ride our machines without being hassled by The Man.
- And we want to get loaded.
- Yeah!
- I second the motion.
I remember asking him, oh, about the third or fourth day of the "Wild Angels"-
I said, "How many of these things have you done?"
He said, "This is my 100th."
This is 42 years ago, and this was his 100th movie he directed.
Oh, my God.
The film was really an incredible success.
It was the biggest-grossing independent film ever made at that time.
"The Wild Angels" was a tremendous success.
It was a huge hit.
It galvanized the whole underground culture.
And that changed his persona and changed the perception of Peter Fonda.
I thought, "This is wonderful.
This is saving me from becoming the next Dean Jones for Disney,"
which is what my agents thought- that I should be that.
Roger felt that I had helped him and contributed something to it.
And he called me and he said,
"Would you like to direct your own picture?"
And I said, "Yes." He said, "All right.
We have a Russian science fiction picture.
And AIP will buy it, but they won't buy it unless I put some women in it.
There's no women in it.
It's all men walking around Venus."
"But what am I supposed to do, Roger?"
He said, "Look at the picture and just decide where to put the women."
"Okay, sure."
"We've got Mamie Van Doren and she'll be one of the women.
Get a couple of other women and just put them in the picture.
And no sound.
Don't write any dialogue.
I don't want to pay for sound."
And I had to explain to Mamie that there would be no dialogue.
She said, "Then what do we do?"
I said, "You look meaningfully atone of the other girls.
And then the other girl will immediately react.
So you look at her and the other girl goes... and goes."
"Telepathy, Mamie- it's telepathy."
We cut this thing together, screened it for Jim Nicholson and he said,
"What the fuck is this about?
What are they doing?
They keep looking and then the other--"
"It's telepathy, Jim."
"It's bullshit." He says, "I don't know what--"
Roger says, "You have to put voices in."
Meriama, Wearie...
"Go get the shells." "Yes."
Ptera is a false god.
Roger is the kind of person who says-
"Do you know how to swim?" "No."
And throws you in the water.
And if you learn to swim because you don't want to drown, you're fine.
And if you drown, that's the end of that.
I think he was alert that this was a time when things were beginning to change.
Certainly there weren't movies being made reflecting the changes in the thinking of young people.
And I think that Roger was alert to that.
What was going on really was revolutionary.
I smoked pot at work.
- Sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll.
- It was blowing up.
Vietnam.
I thought it was the end of America.
I looked at this guy in a cardigan sweater talking about mayhem in the streets.
I was probably the straightest guy in a fairly wild movement.
His political views were becoming increasingly left, as he said at the time, "almost Communist,"
which always makes me laugh, because of course I don't buy that for a minute, but I understand what he means.
For someone who seems so square on the outside, he was actually a very interesting, cool, hip director.
I may have felt at the beginning of the '60s that I was an underdog, but as we got into the '60s,
I thought, "Hey, I'm with the new movement."
By now Roger and I are in sync.
Hey, the man's supporting my whole life.
How could I not be in sync with him?
He asked me to write "The Wild Angels,"
'cause I was writing by then.
I said, "Roger, you know, we're pals in this.
Can't you just pay me a little more than scale?"
If he'd just said, "All right, scale plus $5,"
I would have relaxed.
No.
And I didn't write it.
To write "The Trip," though, he finally said, "All right."
Cut.
It's good here.
How was it for second camera?
- Fine here.
- Okay, print it.
When I decided to make "The Trip" about LSD,
I felt as a director I cannot make a film about LSD without trying LSD.
Initially the idea was that
I would take notes on Roger's trip.
I think he believed that he would be able to coherently dictate notes to me.
How high are you, man?
Can you tell that?
Listen, I think--
I'm afraid.
There's nothing to be afraid of, man.
I had had a wonderful trip, a spectacular trip.
I felt, to be fair, I had to have some experiences of people who'd had bad trips.
Luckily, Jack Nicholson was a very good writer and he knew LSD.
'Cause I was special talent.
Only he and I had actually taken LSD at the point.
I never did it for fun-- too strong.
I mean, a lot of my friends did, but, baby, I mean, what, you want to confront the face of God literally for fun?
Come on.
I'm Peter Fonda.
We've just finished making a movie dealing with the most talked-about subject of the day-
- LSD.
I honestly believe that it will be today's most talked-about motion picture.
Roger's a serious moviemaker.
He wanted to make a serious film about LSD, which had just changed the culture forever, really.
That's what the movie is about.
The artistry of the films really developed.
By the time he did "The Trip," he really had a sense of pushing the power of the image.
What he hit upon in that picture was interesting, particularly if you see it in the full aspect ratio because it just cuts through time and space.
It becomes really a beautiful kind of cinematic montage and achieves a kind of poetry.
AIP were really concerned that this was a pro-drug movie and they would lose money because of that.
It's easy now.
Wait till tomorrow.
Yeah, well, I'll think about that tomorrow.
Arkoff and Nicholson changed the ending on the picture without telling Roger.
They froze frame and did an optical of broken glass on that.
What is power?
You understand?
He created these guys.
This set me up, because in "Easy Rider," the first thing we do is we buy junk in Mexico, smuggle it across the border, get a lot of money, put it in the tank, off we go.
"Easy Rider" came out of my films
"The Wild Angels" and "The Trip."
Peter Fonda starred in both pictures and Dennis Hopper costarred in "The Trip."
That whole thing came from Roger to me-- take The Establishment on.
And since they had never made a picture, they wanted me to be the executive producer.
And I said, "Fine." And I took the idea to AIP because "The Wild Angels" and "The Trip"
had been very successful.
And in one unfortunate meeting, one of the executives at AIP said to Dennis,
"if you fall more than one day behind schedule, we want the right to replace you."
I could see that Dennis and Peter were really mad.
And I said, "I can't put that pressure on Hoppy.
That's not fair." And Roger agreed.
And I said to this executive,
"He worked perfectly with me on 'The Trip' and I am positive he can do this."
And that was not a good thing to say.
A number of things happened and the picture moved over to Columbia.
And AIP and I lost our percentage of the profits on one of the most successful independent pictures ever made.
Oh.
Oh, what am I gonna do now?
When I went to Cannes with "Easy Rider"...
Oh, my head.
...my character came on the screen and the movie exploded in that audience.
It just went ka-pow like it does in rock 'n' roll.
I'm the only person who ever in real life felt,
"Holy shit,
I'm a movie star"- do you know what I mean?
--and knew.
So that's what the change felt like.
I experienced it right here.
Roger, if you paid me over minimum, you would have had "Easy Rider."
"Easy Rider" was the beginning of the new Hollywood.
It's hard to imagine the new Hollywood without Roger Corman.
So many people started with Roger-
Francis Coppola and Bobby De Niro and Jack Nicholson.
And the list goes on and on.
At the end of the '60s Hollywood was so desperate.
They didn't know what to do.
And the young Roger Corman alumni were there to step into the breach.
Jack's career took off.
And Peter and Dennis got deals at Universal to make their movies.
Well, those are all offshoots of the University of Corman.
Roger was in a perfect position, having discovered and cultivated Francis Coppola, Bogdanovich, so many other people like that.
I always wondered why Roger couldn't take that next step with those guys.
You had to take that leap.
You had to go from high school to college or you had to go from college to grad school.
It was a jump that Roger never really took.
And that's the one place that Roger left out of his mix.
And that's why he's constantly being insulted by people calling him the King of the Bs, right?
Roger was never taken seriously.
He was a schlockmeister and a guy who did drive-in movies.
He never really got his due, I don't think.
I mean, even "The Intruder," which is one of his best pictures, it was a movie that was hardly ever seen anywhere when it came out.
Every year at the Academy Awards, they give out a Lifetime Achievement Award.
How they can not have gotten to Roger Corman by now is disgusting.
And I don't know that they ever will, because they'd say,
"Well, what are the great movies he made?"
I guess this proves there are as many nuts in the Academy as anywhere else.
ls Roger worried about being underappreciated?
If he is, I'm going over there tomorrow night.
Shark!
Shark!
Help!
Cut, cut, cut.
Roger Corman isn't doing it for the awards.
The fans recognize him.
The filmmakers recognize him.
We know who he is and we appreciate him.
And I don't think he needs some statue from some organization that never liked his movies in the first place to come out and say, "We love you."
From my viewpoint, everything is going extremely well.
Observing Roger, however, now as actor/producer...
Kevin, you're aware they're putting a mic on the girl who's not in the shot?
Maybe the kit should be just a couple of inches there so you don't step over it.
No, wait until she comes here.
Stop.
It'll be after they say "Action!" because the camera's on her and it's going to come around and see...
Okay, and we're out of the shot.
He is always noticing what needs to be fixed, what is the problem, but that's the nature of producing.
Okay, so I'm looking here.
And on action, you say, "There's someone here to see you."
Rolling sound.
You would think that a man who makes so many films kind of doesn't really care about each individual film, but I think Roger for each of his movies- they're like his children, you know.
And he loves every single one of them.
And he's so engaged in every single one of them.
And, you know, the last time I had lunch with him, you know, he had to hurry away 'cause he was going back to the cutting room of "Minotaur."
And it's like, "You know, Roger..."
They're really- it's just way too much time spent on Iva.
They're working on her makeup all the time.
Explain who she should put it on.
They can't do this stuff for every shot.
I'll never forget Julie.
She was, like, amazing.
She was talking about redecorating her house.
And then she had a child in a crib.
She was raising children, you know.
And here she was- she was known to do movies even cheaper than Roger Corman.
I mean, this woman was amazing.
The first film that I produced, I didn't think of it as producing.
I didn't put a name to it.
I just thought, "Oh, this needs to be organized."
Roger did sit with me for about 45 minutes and go through what's needed- the cast, the crew, and what the positions were and a way in which to shepherd production through.
But then I thought, "Well, he'll be there every day and I could--"
No, he wasn't really available.
And there was this sense I had of,
"He just thinks I can do this?"
And then I just did it.
But he will recognize in someone that he thinks they can do whatever it is.
And then he just walks away and they do it.
I first met Julie when she answered an ad for a job as my assistant.
I offered her the job.
She turned down the job, but she agreed to have dinner with me.
We began dating and we also began working together.
Roger had by then asked me to marry him and I had said yes.
And then he went off to the Philippines and I didn't hear from him for a week.
So I was like, "I wonder what that means."
So I called him and said, "Are we still getting married?"
He said, "Oh, yes.
Did you pick a date?"
And I said, "Well, I was thinking of December or maybe later in the spring."
"Oh, definitely December.
Sooner-- better, right?"
I said, "Okay.
I just wonder why you didn't call me."
Well, he didn't call me because it was a long-distance call, so it wouldn't have occurred to him.
But anyway, you know, getting to know each other.
All right now, everybody, reach for the nightgown of the Lord.
- Reach.
Anybody moves-- you're dead.
Roger had done "Bloody Mama"
with Shelley Winters and Bobby De Niro.
And, you know, it was a great success for AIP.
And AIP wanted another woman gangster movie.
And so I found this book.
It was the story of a woman who'd been something of a tramp, a hobo, had ridden the boxcars of the rail roads of the United States during the Depression.
It was her story as a rebel, as a pre-feminist, as it were, and as an outlaw.
"Boxcar Bertha" the first picture that Julie worked on with me as co-producer.
It was also the first picture that Marty Scorsese directed.
I met him and he said, "Look, I have a sequel to 'Bloody Mama.'
It's called 'Boxcar Bertha.' Would you be interested in doing it?"
I said, "Absolutely," you know.
And "Bloody Mama" actually had De Niro in it, see?
By the time we got to Camden, Arkansas,
Marty had sketched every shot of the picture, which was all over the walls of his motel room.
I took out all these drawings, about 500.
And he looked at the first 20 or 30 or something.
And then he looked, he said, "Did you do this for the entire picture?"
I said, "Yeah." He said, "All right."
He put it away and he left.
Run, Bertha!
God damn that bitch.
The thing that Roger hated was when Sam Arkoff came in-- 'cause he needed Sam because the budget was too big for him.
And then Sam kind of took over and masterminded the release in a way that Roger didn't like.
And Roger said, "I'm never gonna do this again."
And that's when he formed New World and he went back to making $25,000 movies and worked his way back up again just simply so that nobody could tell him, you know, how he should cut his movie or how he should release it.
Roger somehow is fueled by outwitting, I would say, even more than rebelling against, authority.
He was that way with AIP.
I think, actually, it brings out his creativity and his drive.
It just seems to fire him up to just show them that he will do it himself.
He doesn't need them to tell him how to do it or what to do.
I decided to start a small production/dtstrtbution company, a little bit the way AIP had started in the late 1950s.
Roger is a brilliant producer in terms of knowing what the market is, anticipating the trends and then capitalizing on them.
He was a trendsetter for years.
I mean, he-- in the '60s he set every trend.
He has the idea- the original idea for almost all the films that are produced by New World Pictures.
He had a somewhat finite audience.
They weren't expecting things to be held over.
You know, things played for two weeks in the grindhouses and a couple weeks at the drive-in and then a new thing came in.
But within that, you were gonna have a very loyal audience of young people.
Hollywood Boulevard- the street where starlets are made.
On Monday Candy came to Hollywood.
On Tuesday she lost her blouse.
On Thursday she massacred 300 rebel soldiers.
On Friday she found out the bullets were real.
On Saturday she married Godzilla.
By Sunday she was a star.
Things happen fast on Hollywood Boulevard.
Rated R.
♪ Hello, Hollywood. ♪
The fact that the rating system came in was a tremendous change.
Now you were allowed to do things in movies that you hadn't been allowed to do before.
You were allowed to show things.
What they did to her in Jackson County was a crime.
Yvette Mimieux.
"Jackson County Jail,"
where the cops make their own laws and the only way out is murder.
We're cop killers.
There are '70s exploitation pictures that are really out there.
I mean, they have plot twists that are like, "Whoa, I didn't see that coming.
I didn't think people did that in the movies."
Woman was made for man to hunt.
Roger certainly took amazing advantage of that.
Hunters competing for the game.
Set your sights on the tastiest game, from New World Pictures.
Roger's operation is an exploitation operation on almost every level.
He exploits directors.
He exploits writers.
He exploits people in the crafts who are trying to get established.
But we are also exploiting Roger.
I think he had a lot of fun working with these young people.
And so it was often known as, you know, the Corman school of filmmaking.
The first time I met Roger, this crazy Roger Corman-y thing happened where he said, "Okay, you can write press releases.
Do you think you could write a screenplay?"
And this had never really occurred to me, but I said, "Yes."
And he said, "Let me explain.
I'm starting a new company.
It's called New World Pictures.
I need a bunch of pictures to go into the works very soon."
He wanted a nurse movie, but he also wanted to crossbreed it with a prison movie.
Four American nurses, snatched from their work in a foreign hospital, jumped in the jungle, caught between a kill-crazed revolutionary and a sex-crazed major.
Roger says, "Exploitation pictures don't need plots.
But they need sensational things like girls shooting Filipinos out of trees.
That works."
In New World-- they very often go back and add action to a picture.
'Cause you'll see how a rough cut plays, and Roger almost always wants you to add another chase or at least another explosion.
♪ Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school ♪
♪ Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school. ♪
"Rock 'N' Roll High School"- the school where the students rule.
Could your school be next?
We knew the genre notes that we had to hit.
And if we hit those notes, what we put in between those notes was entirely up to us.
"Grand Theft Auto"
is a love story with cars.
Also it's a comedy with car crashes.
"Grand Theft Auto,"
directed by and starring Ron Howard.
Well, hell.
We had a very limited number of extras that we were allowed to have at the big demolition derby climactic action scenes.
And I called Roger asking for more extras to fill out the stands, 'cause, I said, "This is supposed to be this huge event.
There's a big riot at the end.
You know, 75 extras is gonna fill exactly, you know, 1/10 of the stands.
It's gonna look cheesy."
And he said no.
And he could see I was dejected.
And he smiled and he put his hand on my shoulder in a kind of fatherly way.
And he said, "Ron, here's what you need to understand.
You do a good job for me on my terms on this movie, and you never have to work for me again."
And, well, I didn't.
I certainly wish that Roger would move out of the formula film-- the exploitation film.
I guess that he just feels that as long as he's investing his own money that he wants it to be surefire.
In "Death Race" at the very beginning behind us, there's a city of the future.
And it is so obviously a painting.
It's almost a cartoon.
And I said that to him and he said,
"People come to my pictures looking for camp.
And I'm going to give it to them."
If he just violated this rule of his of never making a movie that cost more than $1 million, you know, and make one for $1.5 million or $2 million--
I said, "Look, all your pictures make money.
None of them go through the top."
And he said, "Yeah, that's true."
And then he went over and turned off the air conditioner.
Sometimes the movies were really dreadful and you had to just sort of camp them up and make fun of them.
- "Cover Girl Models."
- And we did-- by the time we got to "Cover Girl Models," we were doing outrageous ad lines- you know, "They don't need clothes to strike a pose";
"They're always overexposed but they're never underdeveloped"-- to the point where the pictures looked like jokes.
They didn't look like they were real movies.
They're like movies in the front of "Tropic Thunder."
They just didn't look real.
But the audiences never minded.
They were happy.
The limitations of a low-budget film can work positively in terms of getting something spontaneous.
There's no time for rehearsal.
There's no time for extended discussions of motivation and character and so forth.
And indeed there aren't many characters or motivations in any of the films.
You'll never be a star now, you little cunt.
The great thing about working for Roger was that every possible obstacle to making a movie was thrown in front of you.
Beverly Hills police.
And if you could figure out a way to get around them, you could make your movie.
At the end credits of "Hollywood Boulevard,"
that background shot was shot while the camera crew was hiding in the bushes and I was talking to the Beverly Hills police and explaining that I was just out here admiring the scenery.
And they said, "Well, get back in your car and drive down the hill."
It's not as bad as John Davis and having to spend the night in jail while making "Fly Me," though.
I think when he called Roger and he said, "I'm in jail,"
I think Roger said, "Well, you know, that's a good experience.
You should learn from this."
Blossom, honey.
You philandering, fornicating bastard, you went off with that skinny honky for two days and gonna come back here and call me honey?
Now wait a minute, Blossom, honey.
I told you I was gonna cut it off if you tried to pull that shit on me.
We called it "make do."
You know, whatever you can do to make do, that's what we did.
And from it, I lived through my stunts.
I look back at it-- would I do them again?
Yes, but more padding on the head.
Not a lot of women wanted to do stunts.
All right, everybody, back 'em up.
And they couldn't handle guns.
They were afraid of guns.
Sit down on the floor.
Where do you want to be buried, nigger?
And it's Miss Nigger to you.
And there weren't a lot of women who wanted to be tossed around the room or thrown over a cliff.
And he said, "Let's keep her doing movies.
She loves to do crazy stuff.
Let's set her on fire."
You know, "How many cars can she crash today?"
They loved that.
He could talk you into, you know, buying some sand in a desert.
Hey, and it'll taste good, too.
I'm like, "Excuse me, did I just buy this glass of sand from Roger?"
"The Final Comedown"-- this year's heaviest motion picture.
Baby, I'm not bitter.
I was bitter 350 years ago.
I'm violent, you hear me, God damn it?
Violent!
Get hip to this year's winner-- the fight you've been dying for.
Rated R, it's a mother.
Dig it.
I did bring "Mean Streets" first to Roger.
And it was the beginning of the Blaxploitation pictures.
And he said, "So the story is interesting and everything.
It's really interesting.
I can give you a couple hundred thousand dollars to do it, but if you could swing a little bit and make it black, it might be-- we might have something here."
So I thought about it.
I said, "Okay, let me think about it."
I wouldn't say no.
I always say yes to these things.
And I walked out and realized my heart sank because I realized, no, they're Italian-Americans.
That's the part of the cultural thing.
It's Sicilians and Neapolitans and ancient code that goes back to the medieval times.
You're a fucking jerk-off.
And I'll tell you something else, Mikey-
I fuck you right where you breathe, 'cause I don't give two shits about you or nobody else.
I said, "That's-- totally not.
I'm not gonna be able to do it."
But because of "Boxcar Bertha"
and because of the group that worked on the film,
I learned how to make the picture within a certain amount of time.
And we were able to take the same principles that we applied to "Boxcar Bertha" and use them for "Mean Streets."
We wound up shooting most of it in Los Angeles because we had that crew and the Corman crew knew how to work.
Roger's own personal taste in pictures is very different from the type of pictures that he makes.
And also his taste in directors tends towards Antonioni and Bergman.
Most of our films are domestic.
However, we do distribute a number of foreign films--
Bergman, Fellini, Truffaut, now Kurosawa and a number of others.
Roger had a lot of connections and he had his own distribution company.
And when the majors started to give up on foreign films,
Roger talked people like Ingmar Bergman and Fellini into--
"I can get your picture on screens that have never run a movie of yours, because I have a different audience and a different way of selling the movie."
And they all signed off on it.
Ingmar Bergman was a seminal influence on Roger as a director.
"Cries and Whispers" did extremely well and Ingmar Bergman was very pleased.
And then Roger being Roger, he had the idea to distribute it in drive-ins.
And that's what he did.
No one else had ever been able to do that before, and probably not since.
That was something new for Roger, to have such prestige people associated with him.
And it just went from there.
Roger, when he formed New World Pictures, was the first company that was completely bifurcated.
In other words, in one direction they were doing exploitation films, but in the other direction they were doing the best foreign-language films that were out there at that time.
The money is secondary in that particular area.
It's because I feel these films should get to a larger audience than they do.
The new Fellini--
"Amarcord."
The company is building very rapidly, which takes a lot of time.
My wife and I have had three children in three consecutive summers, which takes a certain amount of time.
We would go home in the evening and talk about the problems of the day.
Then there got to be a time when we, like, just didn't talk about what had happened during the day.
But it got to be a little embarrassing because Roger didn't really know what all I was doing and I didn't really know what all he was doing.
And I said, "Look, Roger, it's very embarrassing when people say, 'What movies is Roger making?
' and I don't know.
You know, it is our company, but there's what you're making and what I'm making."
And so he said, "Well, I'll tell you what I'm making."
He said, "I'm making 12 films."
And he couldn't remember the last two.
So he said, "Well, whatever they are, I'm gonna cancel them."
You had made a statement to the press that you were getting out of exploitation films and into higher-budget films.
What brought you back into it?
In my last years as a director,
I was climbing out of the low-budget field and was doing more expensive films, but when I started my own company, which was financed essentially out of my own savings,
I was forced back to low-budget films because those were all I could afford.
New World has had several profitable years and we're now starting to make more expensive films and we're climbing once more.
Roger's had such success with New World Pictures in the past couple of years that now people are dying to invest in his movies.
And if a script is going around town which has his endorsement on it and a promise that he will distribute it, you're in fabulous shape.
There's an old story about the producer with a successful Broadway play.
And his friend comes to him and says,
"Here's the way we can fix the second act."
And the producer says, "Never -- around with a winner."
Roger came bounding up the stairs.
And he said,
"Ron, you're here.
Have you heard the news?"
I said, "No." "Great news:
'Grand Theft Auto'--"
which was a very successful movie for him--
"'Grand Theft Auto' just sold to CBS.
It's the first time we've ever sold a movie to the networks- for $1.1 million."
And I said, "Well, that's great, Roger."
He said, "It's fantastic.
That makes your 7.5% look awfully good."
'Cause I had a little profit participation in "Grand Theft Auto."
I said, "Yeah, it does." He said,
"it makes my 92.5% look goddamn wonderful."
There is a creature alive today.
It lives to kill-- a mindless eating machine.
It is as if God created the devil and gave him jaws.
The blockbuster movie of the summer is "Jaws,"
the tale of a murderous white shark...
The record-breaking box office receipts created by "Jaws"...
- ...the movie "Jaws."
- Some people who have seen it are now seeing phantom sharks every time...
- Steven Spielberg...
- "Time Magazine" seldom...
- When that movie was released...
See it before you go swimming.
When Steven Spielberg made "Jaws,"
he took a very Cormanesque idea- you know, the killer shark.
I mean, it doesn't get any more Corman than that-- killer shark eating naked girls as they go skinny-dipping.
Once people got a taste of movies like "Jaws,"
they really didn't want the drive-in movies anymore.
They stopped going
They wanted to go to the theaters and be part of some cultural phenomenon that everyone was talking about and everyone was going to see.
And it wasn't about taking your girl to the drive-in.
And then everything kind of changed
- on the day "Star Wars" came out.
- Yeah.
We went to an 11:00 show right over at the Chinese and it was extraordinary.
- When these lines appeared...
- Yeah.
...everybody was astounded.
I mean, they couldn't understand.
"Jaws"-- it was like, okay, it's a best-seller and we sort of know that's gonna make a lot of money.
But "Star Wars" came from nowhere.
And all of a sudden this gigantic change happened.
It was just like the "Easy Rider" change.
It was like going to a revival meeting.
That first screening just was amazing.
When I saw "Star Wars"
I said, "This is a threat to me because it means that the major studios are beginning to understand what we've been doing for $100,000 or so and they're now doing it for multi-millions of dollars.
And it's going to be very difficult for us to compete."
I felt the major studios are hitting straight into what has been my bread and butter for 20 years and also the staple of many of my compatriots.
"Jaws" and then "Star Wars"
set a whole new standard.
I mean, just the bar got set higher.
You couldn't really get away with doing cheap science fiction films anymore.
I hated "Star Wars."
If "Star Wars" doesn't make a ton of cabbage, you know, we'd still be having these weird green flashing lines going across the screen.
All these guys are coming from film school.
We're all coming from, "Let us get a job."
He did it first with horror pictures, with science fiction pictures which he did for no money and, you know, quickly and unpretentiously.
That's who we are today.
And I miss the Roger Corman versions.
What we see now is the tent poles of the studios.
The summer and Christmas tent poles are very often films that could have been done by Roger Corman at a much smaller budget.
But those are the films now that are attracting the top filmmakers and the biggest budgets.
And what has the wonderful revolution done for independence of filmmaking?
Well, we make 12 circuses a year and very few movies.
When you read that a picture cost $35 million to make, what do you think of that cost?
Actually I think it's wrong.
I think the artist should be able to express himself for less money than that.
And the businessman should be able to invest his money better.
I think from both an artistic and a commercial standpoint, it is wrong to spend that much money.
And in addition,
I think there are better things to do with the money in our society.
- For example?
- You could- for $30 million or $40 million, which is what some of these films are costing, you could rebuild a portion of the slums of a city,
- just as one example.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
So you think it's obscene to spend that much money.
Yes, I would use that word.
Once the "Star Wars" juggernaut thing happened and the idea that everything had to be an event movie, it just became difficult.
The business changed.
He ended up having to go direct to video with a lot of the stuff.
There's just 100 billion shelves with 100 billion DVDs and it's very hard to stick out.
He switched over to making slasher movies.
And that was a very limited genre, so it was harder to make something that was interesting in that genre.
I met him at a dinner party in New York in the early '30s.
And I said, "Aren't you gonna do any more?
Are you gonna direct a few more?"
He said, "I don't think so.
The whole scene is changing- screwdrivers going into people's heads.
It just doesn't-- it doesn't-- I don't belong there anymore."
I think he's become more obscure.
And I think that's too bad, because I think he really has a very important legacy in Hollywood.
When a lot of his stuff went straight to DVD,
I think he lost a little bit of his mystique and cachet.
If you walked up to any 20, 25-year-old film buff and asked if they knew who Roger was,
I think unfortunately they probably don't.
Gosh, I mean, how many other people have made 400-- 335 movies, you know?
If he hadn't done seven million other pictures, he'd have the same reputation as any of the other artistes.
Are the people with whom you've worked over the years still friendly with you?
Do they like you?
Do they call you on the phone now and again and say,
"Hi, Roger.
How is it going?"
I think so.
I still talk with them.
Careers move in different directions, but most of them are still friends of mine.
They use words with you like, forgive me, "the schlockmeister."
Does that bother you when they say those things?
- Yes.
- Does it?
- Yeah, it bothers me, right.
- It should.
You're just trying...
Roger Corman made it okay for all of us to make exploitation movies.
He showed that you shouldn't be embarrassed.
There's nothing wrong with you for loving a movie like "Piranha."
That it doesn't mean that you're stupid for loving a movie that seems like a stupid exploitation movie.
And that a lot of these films are very smart, made with lots of intelligence and that it's okay to have fun at the movies.
I think it's very important to let the generation of today know who he is.
We all-- we knew it almost 40 years ago.
So it's time to reintroduce him as a director, but also what he represents of American entertainment.
He represents a side of Hollywood sort of unto his own, you know.
You know, there are a lot of Samuel Goldwyns, a lot of Irving Thalbergs.
There's really only one Roger Corman.
That style of filmmaking, that attitude, that approach to filmmaking really is unparalleled.
You know, I know it's right to have the tie hand-tied, but frankly the pre-tied ties look better because they're perfect.
I guess the whole idea is if it's slightly imperfect, it's considered to be handmade.
Yes.
There's delight in disorder.
Right.
Now...
- There you go.
- Okay.
We're gonna give the Lifetime Achievement Award to Roger Corman.
And they've asked me to be part of it.
I got to call him.
And I said to him,
"The board of governors of the Motion Picture Academy has voted to give you an honorary Oscar for your life achievement."
And there was silence.
He wasn't--
He goes, "Excuse me?
That's unbelievable."
The funny part is, of course, that Roger is, you know, the ultimate fierce independent.
So I told him, "Yes," I said,
"I know when you get up there, you're really gonna stick it to The Man."
Roger, if you could stand,
I'd like to offer you a toast.
For all your progressive influence in our medium and for our industry, it's our honor to salute you tonight, Roger.
- Hear, hear.
The Academy thanks you.
Hollywood thanks you.
Independent filmmaking thanks you.
But most importantly, for all the wild, weird, cool, crazy moments you've put on the drive-in screens, the movie lovers of the planet Earth thank you.
He is one of the finest personages in our field.
Roger, please come up to accept your Oscar.
Needless to say, I'm delighted to accept this Oscar personally, but I'd also like to accept it on behalf of my wife Julie,
- who's been my--
--my producing partner for many years.
I think that to succeed in this world you have to take chances.
I believe the finest films being done today are done by the original, innovative filmmakers who have the courage to take a chance and to gamble.
So I say to you.
Keep gambling.
Keep taking chances.
- Thank you.
When I think of sort of sublime moments in my professional life,
I think of winning an Academy Award, and right next to it is the wrap party for "Grand Theft Auto."
Actually everybody grab for it.
I'd always dreamed of making a movie and Roger let me make a movie.
And not only did I make it,
I loved it more than I ever dreamed I might.
Is this sort of like the way you get an honorary degree at Harvard?
Am I an honorary member of the Roger Corman school of filmmaking?
You know, I don't know.
I'm actually a little tongue-tied when I'm with Roger.
I just have- you know, we're completely different kind of people.
And I have such respect for him.
You know, every once in a while
Roger would come to my rescue pretty much, you know, when things were- nothing was happening.
My husband left me and the phone stopped ringing, but the only person who called me was Roger.
And he said, "You can direct a picture any time you want.
I'll produce it for you."
So he's the only person who called me.
We'll put them on our Facebook pages.
I mean, there's nobody in there that he didn't in the most important way support.
He was, you know, my main connec-- my lifeblood to whatever I thought I was gonna be as a person.
And, you know, I hope he knows that this is not all hot air.
I'm gonna cry now.
Not just me, who's very sentimental, but these other people also love him.
Sorry.
Mike, I've just gotten off the phone with Syfy.
They're very worried about the climax of the script.
They believe the Mayan dance sequence in the jungle is not big enough.
I'm going to make the stage bigger and bring in almost a Mayan village rather than a temple.
He wants to stay in the game.
To some extent, he does see making movies as a game, a game that you can win or lose.
And staying in means that you're winning.
These are for "Splatter."
- Oh, for "Splatter," okay.
- Yes.
He really epitomized what's wonderful about the American dream- that you can succeed no matter what.
Even if you fail, you can reinvent yourself.
If you love it and you're allowed to keep working, or you have the energy to keep working, as Roger does, there is no retirement age.
No one kind of gives you your gold watch and tells you to go home because your career's over.
Let's go back.
Cut on the frame after she exits the shot-- bam!
right there.
There's an Arab maxim, which is,
"The dogs bark, but the caravan moves on."
And this is Roger to me, as the caravan, you know.
He's making the decision and moving forward.
And you're saying, "But wait a minute, you haven't thought about what the actors will think.
And what about if the truck isn't available?"
"We're gonna shoot this here now."
Consider yourselves officially enrolled in Rock 'n' Roll High School.
The facilities are yours.
Do whatever you want.
What the hell?
- Sir.
- Excuse me, I'm on the phone.
- The piranhas.
- What about the goddamn piranhas?
They're eating the guests, sir.
Hey, quiet.
Quiet, everybody.
Listen.
Quiet.
In a filmmaking career that has spanned over 30 years, my next guest is the man responsible for such cinematic classics as "the house of Usher," "wild angels,"
"the monster from the ocean floor,"
"the attack of the crab monsters."
Please welcome Roger corman.
Low-budget movies in those days-- it wasn't like today.
Nobody was really trying to make them good.
There was the real emphasis on the price.
Roger corman has made more than 200 motion pictures in his career, most of them for extremely low budget.
He's produced around 150-175 films.
He made so many movies.
In 1957, he directed 10 movies.
Most people don't get to do that.
He made 250 movies and never lost a dime.
Okay, this is not a $20-million movie.
You know, this is a $1.98 science fiction movie.
We knew these were made fast and cheap, and we also knew that taste was out of the question.
There was no need for taste.
The way Disney movies, you know, bring out the child in all of us, you know, so can exploitation.
Sometimes he'll give the notes right on the script and you get little marginal references like
"breast nudity possible here?" Question mark.
The goal was, Roger said, "every motorcycle that runs, have it smash into something.
And then when it stops running, blow it up."
Aah!
He said, "your job, if the cops come, is to pick up the camera and run."
I said, "we're in the middle of the desert.
What do you mean, there is no water?"
It's a Roger corman movie, you know.
There's no water.
You know, they kind of went around the sound stage, one take on everything.
That's just the way he worked.
You know, you didn't argue with him.
And we were delighted to be working.
It doesn't matter if people are happy.
It doesn't matter if you have a permit.
None of it matters.
You know, the only thing that counts is what you get inside the frame.
He's still around, making pictures in his 80s and he's-- i just saw him the other day.
He hasn't changed at all.
Man:
One, two, three.
And action!
Man:
One, two, three.
I'm in the water with a giant creature on my arms pumping blood out, chomping on a beautiful girl in a bikini.
I mean, it's the essence of Roger corman cinema.
Roger corman:
We feel that the monster should kill somebody fairly early and then at regular intervals through the picture.
The first kill should be quite shocking.
The other kills can be a little bit less shocking as we build up.
And then of course the climax-- everything goes, blood all over the screen.
Frances doel:
Roger had made two previous movies for the syfy channel that did very well for them.
And he said, "okay, Frances, it's 'dinoshark.' you know what that is."
And of course I say, "yes, I know what that is.
It's a giant shark."
"Yes, but not too much like 'jaws."' "No, of course not."
- Woman:
122-Charlie, take three.
- Man:
Marker.
Julie corman:
"Dinoshark" is about a shark that is unloosed because of global warming from an avalanche north of Alaska...
Eric balfour:
That's your killer.
It hasn't eaten in 150 million years and it's hungry.
Julie:
...And somehow mysteriously makes its way south to puerto vallarta and pretty much terrorizes everybody and everything in sight.
David carradine:
You know, that whole world is just so different from the "entertainment weekly" world or the academy award world.
The golden globes don't even hear about these things.
You know, these pictures-- they just go someplace else.
And there's an incredible number of people that want to see a picture just like this.
Doel:
The paradise village location also had some accommodation for actors and crew and so on.
So that's always been one of those little tricks up Roger's sleeve-- how he can do what he does on a budget.
Roger always said, you know, "you could make 'Lawrence of Arabia' for a half a million dollars.
You just don't leave the tent."
Balfour:
If you could imagine knows Berry farm set on a beach, but the only people in the park were senior citizens, no rides, but it had a theme-park-like atmosphere, that is what we have affectionately dubbed paradise prison.
Who is two minutes from being ready for what?
Balfour:
At first I thought it was maybe some kind of electromagnetic field that doesn't allow the walkie-talkie service.
Man:
I need a radio that works.
But it turns out that we just bought, you know, children's walkie-talkies.
This is full-on guerilla-style filmmaking.
I mean, you know, we're sort of running and gunning and stealing locations and driving boats
- where they shouldn't be driven.
- Man:
Go, go, go, get out!
Oh, my god.
At one point they wanted somebody to get in this water...
- Man:
Action!
- ...
To get attacked by something.
Well, it turns out there was actually things to get attacked by.
Not that this wasn't obvious.
There was a giant sign that said "crocodiles."
Should she be there?
Well, that's where she was in the wide shot.
- The way this will be cut, it'll work.
- Okay.
All right.
You wouldn't think of the movies, if you met him, that he'd have done all these movies-- very polite, very-- almost British.
He really came across, I felt, as more like an English film professor, you know.
I expected him to be teaching at Oxford or Cambridge rather than kind of making all of these kind of violent exploitation movies that he had made.
I thought he'd be more like Lee j.
Cobb, let's say, or somebody a little-- where they're smoking a cigar and pounding on the desk and--
"you kids get in there and do that work," and, you know-- and actually he's very eloquent, elegant and precise, cool-headed, from what I saw, and very, very different from the type of person
you'd think would be behind these pictures like "teenage cave man."
Corman:
The difference between the image you present to the world and what is going on inside, in your unconscious mind, is significant.
I've been told that my image is
I'm just sort of an ordinary straight guy.
Clearly my unconscious mind is some sort of a boiling inferno there.
Like most kids, i was interested in films essentially all my life.
I graduated from Stanford university in California in engineering.
I worked four days as an engineer and quit.
The only job I could get in films was a messenger at 20th century fox.
And I worked my way up from that to become a story analyst.
I read scripts, commented on them, and handed in a synopsis of the script or the novel or whatever had been proposed with my opinion.
As the youngest reader, i was given frankly the most hopeless scripts to cover.
And the story editor said,
"Roger, you have never recommended one script."
And I said, "you've never given me a script that's worth recommending."
So they sent me a script which was the first thing I'd ever read at fox that I thought was really any good at all.
And I made a number of notes on it.
The picture became "the gunfighter" starring Gregory peck.
And the story editor got a bonus for my notes.
And I got no recognition for the fact that a number of my ideas were used in the script.
This became a big hit for fox.
You would have thought he would have had some acknowledgement.
This caused him to leave fox and become what he is today.
After "the gunfighter,"
he corralled some money from our parents and some of his money and a few friends', got an enormous number of deferments and made his first film-- "monster from the ocean floor."
And that was basically the beginnings of Roger corman.
I was the producer, the assistant director and everything.
I would drive the truck to the location and unload everything I could by myself.
And I would save about an hour on the crew salary every morning.
The second picture I made was a picture called "the fast and the furious."
It was about road racing and of course had very, very little money.
Jonathan haze:
Roger went to some sports car dealerships and borrowed sports cars.
And we took the windshields off them and actually raced them.
And then we'd clean them up and take them back.
Roger was just so inane at the time and was trying to do it himself and was starting to run out of money.
If you don't understand money in the movie business, it's like an artist who doesn't understand paint.
Roger told me, "well, I understand paint.
If I got to thin her up with turpentine or there's no picture, why, she gets thinned up a little.
That's all there is to it."
I could see the problem for the independent.
You raised the money.
You made the picture.
And then you had to wait for the picture to earn its money back before you could make another picture.
But Sam arkoff and Jim Nicholson were starting a new company-- American international.
And they made me an offer for "the fast and the furious"
to start their company with.
I said, "i want a three-picture deal in which I'm guaranteed my money back.
As soon as I finish one film,
I go to the next one using the guarantee."
And that essentially started me on a regular basis of making films and started American international.
Don't call me "squaw."
You're a dirty apache squaw.
I'm gonna kill you.
Your people did that-- raiding, thieving, killing.
Haze:
I was very famous for fighting with the girls.
This was "apache woman."
Joan Taylor and I did a knife fight in the street.
And this is dick Miller in the background where he belonged.
A friend of mine, Jonathan haze, said,
"well, maybe I'll introduce you to Roger corman and he can help you."
We went down there.
He said, "what do you do?"
I said, "I'm a writer."
He said, "we don't need any writers right now."
He says, "i need actors." I said, "I'm an actor."
He says, "you want to play an Indian for me?"
At the end I got killed.
Roger said, "how would you like to play a cowboy for me?"
I said, "oh, are we going to another picture?"
He says, "no, no, this picture."
I said, "oh, god.
Okay."
I wound up killing myself in the last scene.
I don't know what the budgets were, but they were really low.
We shot them in seven days, so that gives you an idea.
And that's everything, including special effects or anything else, you know.
Some weren't all that great, and Roger'd be the first guy to tell you that.
I never had the opportunity to go to film school.
My student work was being shown on the screen.
And some of it wasn't quite as good as it might have been, but I was learning all the time.
Beat it, I said.
You're on a battlefield.
I know that better than you do, sergeant.
How well are you doing?
Half my men are dead.
Nothing can stop that thing.
Call off your troops.
Scorsese:
It's as if these films were being made on your street corner, in a way.
They weren't encumbered by having to deal with "art"
with a capital a-r-t.
They just weren't-
- I mean, they're art in another way.
Corman:
I learned fairly quickly how to handle the camera, what to do with editing, but I didn't know enough about acting, and I felt I should simply take a class.
And that was where I met Jack Nicholson.
Nicholson:
He came into the class with that little smile, and everybody's as serious as a heart attack, you know.
He had-- when I was first working for him, he told me he had 12 companies, the contracts of which were all in his back pocket.
I mean, he was a one-man band.
Don't make me.
Don't be a fool, kid.
You think I would carry a real gun?
As a matter of fact, the first picture Jack Nicholson starred in was for me-- a picture called "the cry baby killer"
about a kid who takes a drive-in hostage.
It's coming.
Can't you get him to be quiet until it comes?
Nicholson:
I hadn't really worked at all before.
Then I got a lead in the movie.
I thought, "oh, this is it.
I'm here.
I'm gonna be big," you know.
Then I didn't even get an interview for the next year.
Look, Carole was a swell girl until Manny got his hands on her.
You mean, till she wanted Manny's hands on her.
Listen, Fred...
"Cry baby killer" was just humiliating but good for me.
Hey, Roger's the only guy who hired me for about 10 years.
Teenagers-- never had 'em when I was a kid.
The word "teenager" didn't really exist until the '50s.
If you look at the '40s and '30s, their idea of a teenage movie was "Andy Hardy."
Hey, Betsy.
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!
What do you think's happened?
- What do you think's happened?
- What?
Well, tell me what.
Cynthia won't go to the dance and i don't know why and I don't want to.
Times were changing.
- Dave!
- Okay, Johnny.
Corman:
The major studios didn't really understand the audience was looking for a different type of film.
If we were going to make pictures about young people,
I'd have picked a young guy like Jack Nicholson.
But you're through breaking the law.
Sarge, I don't break the law.
I make my own.
Roger really realized that young people at that time really liked movies where teenagers were in trouble with the authorities.
He had found an audience that you didn't have to go through the studio system to reach.
Not only was he a rebel from Hollywood in that he did it all himself and did it outside of the studio system, but there was an edge of rebellion, you know, to the movies.
Dante:
You make it as disreputable as possible so that the parents wouldn't want them to see it and that they feel that when they go there, they're doing something transgressive, and you've got an audience.
You're making outlaw movies, basically.
And Roger has always been an outlaw.
Let go of me, you big ape!
Now beat it, smart boy, and don't come back or I'll break your head.
Break whose head, you phony frenchman?
You ain't so tough.
Took this moosehead to throw me out.
Corman:
I've always been anti-establishment.
I spent two years in the Navy.
Those were the worst two years of my life.
I came very close to setting the record for the most demerits, because I felt if they set up a rule,
I really must break that rule.
Ron Howard:
Roger understood the need for audiences to identify with rebellion.
Beating the system-- that's cathartic, you know, defining yourself on your own terms.
These things are elemental.
They're all what we go through during those rites of passage.
I think that he understood that when he was dealing with those basic experiences and feelings that he was talking to a young audience.
We know he always had something up his sleeve.
He was more irreverent.
He was more hip-- very hip, very cool.
"A bucket of blood" is a really good example of parody of the hip scene, the beat scene in la.
Walter, you've done something to me, something deep down inside of my prana.
I have?
Oh, Walter, i want to be with you.
You're creative.
Almost all of Roger's pictures has a little edge to them.
They were-- they just bordered on something sacrosanct, that you shouldn't touch this, and he did it anyway.
And that's usually what pulled the picture through.
Feed me.
I'm sorry, pal.
I'm fresh out of blood.
Talk to somebody else.
I'm hungry.
I don't care what you are.
Can't you see I'm knocked out?
I just killed a man.
I'm a murderer.
He was always pushing.
Roger's idea at the time was to cut down the time of shooting.
So now his ambition was to make a film in two days.
Now no novocain.
It dulls the senses.
Haze:
It was work.
I mean, we would get there early in the morning and we'd just start grinding out these scenes.
One day was half the movie.
Oh, my god, don't stop now.
Roger had borrowed all the dental equipment from his personal dentist and they hadn't bolted it down to the floor.
We banged into this big dental shit and it started to fall over.
And Roger cut the camera and ran out and saved the dental equipment.
To hell with the scene.
I can truly say I've never enjoyed myself so much.
Nicholson:
I'd have terrible experiences going into the theater with movies that I had made in that period with Roger, 'cause, you know, they were kind of-- a lot of them were grim.
- Bye.
- Bye now.
By mistake he actually made a good picture every once in a while.
I was never in it, but that was as much my fault as the next guy's.
Corman:
By the beginning of the '60s
I began to have confidence in my ability to master the craft.
At least she has found peace now.
Has she?
Jonathan demme:
We'd never miss a poe movie.
They were riveting and stylish and hip and funny.
And we couldn't wait for the next one.
And of course with Roger, you didn't have to wait very long.
The next one was gonna come out, like, a month later.
Do you know where you are, bartolome?
The pit and the pendulum.
Howard:
The poe movies were huge for me, especially "the pit and the pendulum."
They had this TV campaign where the blade was coming down, you know, and just kind of-- whew.
And, oh, my god, it was-- and I rushed.
In fact, that's probably the first time that a TV campaign made me go to the movie.
They were so successful,
I ended up making six Edgar Allan poe films.
Scorsese:
The artistry of the films really developed into the poe pictures:
"The house of Usher," "the pit and the pendulum,"
and "the tomb of ligeia," which is my favorite.
She desecrates the earth in which she lies.
A nervous contraction, nothing more.
Scorsese:
He was a name that we'd go like--
I must say like a Hitchcock film.
We'd go see a Roger corman.
Corman:
They wanted me to make more, but by that time I said, "enough.
I'm starting to repeat myself."
We played it for a little bit of humor in some of the later pictures, particularly "the raven."
Nicholson:
I was doing "the raven."
And he said, "Jack, look, these sets are gonna be up over the weekend, so I can use the same sets for free.
I'm gonna have somebody write something."
And he went and he got a guy who wrote 68 pages of just dialogue.
To this day, no one knows the plot of "the terror."
It was very strange.
I mean, we played the weirdest characters.
I played a guy that was an assistant to a witch.
In the beginning of the film, I'm a deaf-mute.
And then halfway through the film, they decided that they didn't have an ending for the film.
They'd better make me talk.
I can say no more.
There is great danger.
Find Eric.
Eric knows.
Haze:
Dick played a livery Butler with a New York accent.
Nicholson:
And you'll see in the picture now-- god forbid, I don't want to encourage anyone to see it--
I throw dick Miller up against this door.
Where's the baron?
We must get to him.
He's locked himself in the crypt.
And dick Miller now tries to explain the entire picture in one speech.
The baron did return that night to find Eric with the baroness and he did kill her.
But there was a struggle, and in the fight it was not Eric who died, but the baron.
I killed the baron.
It's the only film that I'd defy anybody to-- 'cause there is-- there's no story actually arrived at.
Corman:
Various directors shot the film.
Francis coppola started and shot some sequences at big sur, but then got an opportunity at a major studio.
So I had monte hellman shoot for a while.
Monte then got another job and I think--
I've forgotten all the directors.
There were four or five directors, including finally Jack Nicholson shot some scenes himself.
And eventually i went in for an hour and shot the final tie-in shots and finished the picture.
It is a somewhat confusing picture.
Oh, man, god.
Hopeless, all of it.
I think he wanted to be taken seriously as a filmmaker because up until then he'd been making monster movies and Sci-Fi movies.
Perhaps it's not so much that he wanted critical acclaim, but he wanted some depth, some feeling, some reason for making a movie.
I wanted to do something a little bit different.
And I'd read the book "the intruder,"
which was about the integration of the schools in the south.
And I wanted to make that picture.
I was very much in favor of integration.
I showed the screenplay to American international and said, "this will be my next picture."
To my real surprise, they said they didn't want to make it.
And they'd never said no.
I took it to allied artists.
They said no.
Everybody said no, so I said, "all right, I'll make it myself."
So my brother and i produced it in the south.
"He was a leader of men, but he was evil.
He was a stranger, but he brought lust and love, rape and hate to this quiet Southern town.
He was the intruder."
This is not the reason we made this film.
It is the exact opposite of what we intended this film to be.
It was not and is not an exploitation film.
This picture was the first film that Roger could actually make a statement about his personal feelings as opposed to doing the poe films or the films that were just exploitation, drive-in films.
Corman:
Playing the lead was the new young actor making his first film-- bill shatner.
All I knew was that it was a wonderful part and it was a wonderful opportunity for me at an early point in my career.
The character I played was based on a real person.
He was a white supremacist from New York City and went down into the south to rabble-rouse and tries to stop the integration of a school.
I mean, they've got 10 niggers enrolled already in the school.
And they're starting Monday.
Yes, I know.
Do you think it's right?
No, I sure don't.
Neither does nobody.
But it's the law.
Whose law?
Shatner:
What is difficult for people to understand now--
"separate but equal" was the law of the land.
That meant water fountains, that meant restaurants, it meant schools that were totally segregated.
It was the height of the integration wars.
It became very apparent once we were down there that people held polar opposite views of what was right and what was wrong.
Man:
Take it easy, nigger.
You're not going anywhere.
- Driver:
What's the trouble?
- Are you looking for trouble?
No, sir.
We're on our way to the house.
"Just on our way to the house."
I didn't tell people what the subject matter is, but the title-- "lntruder," you know.
And with the track record of Roger, all the films,
I mean, they naturally thought it was a horror film or something in that genre.
It was only as everything started to unfold and they saw exactly what was happening--
I mean, people were driving us out of locations.
We had to change motels.
I mean, it got to be very heavy down there.
Hey, are you really gonna make him go to the white school tomorrow?
Why, I'm not making him go.
Am I, Joey?
- No, ma.
- Well, it's too bad I ain't old enough.
I wouldn't be scared, that's all.
Who's scared?
We were having our lives threatened to make a film about integration.
Roger displayed such courage under fire.
And gene corman, his brother-- such courage to make the film.
There was such animosity and the experience of hatred that I think we realized we had a bigger problem.
I think we were more naive than we should have been at that point in time.
You were alone with a white girl in the basement of the school, but you didn't try to do anything?
Is that what you expect us to believe, nigger?
Well, speak up!
Gene:
We felt we should definitely expose our audience to this kind of material, because this is what was going on in America and somebody had to say, "stop.
This is not the American way."
It was a lie-- everything, everything I said about Joey, all of it.
You were gonna kill this boy.
You know it and I know it.
Shatner:
Making films is a dedication.
You have to be possessed.
At some point there, i realized that they had mortgaged their home for that film.
That, perhaps, was the most admirable thing of all, because it's one thing to be cavalier about spending money that isn't yours, but to be so adamant as to put your house on the line,
that's-- that's extraordinary.
We aren't gonna give up now, not now.
No, sir, not ever.
Gene:
I'd set up the sneak preview with pacific theaters.
It was almost a riot in the theater.
People were screaming, "communist!"
And one of the ushers or one of the people who worked at the theater came up to me, pinned me against the wall, said, "you're a communist.
You don't belong in this country."
The picture was a wonderful commercial failure.
I started to say "a wonderful critical success,"
but I got confused.
But I'll leave the confusion there because it's all wound up in my mind.
It sort of gets me in the stomach when I talk about it.
Gene:
This is the only film that I don't think we ever made money on.
And yet it was our best film.
We were ahead of the time.
It made me rethink my method of making pictures.
And I felt the public really is the ultimate arbiter of your film.
If there's something you really want to do-- in Roger's case it's making movies-- then you keep on doing it.
Every time you fail, you just keep on.
Corman:
I thought, "i should go back to a more commercial type of film."
I was starting to learn method acting technique.
There was what was known as the text and the subtext.
The text is the written script, what you were saying.
The subtext is what you mean, what you really feel, that causes you to say these words.
And I felt
I should make my subject matter the text, which will be a commercial text, but my theme, my message, what is important to me, should be the subtext, so the audience will get what they paid their money to see.
I think he consciously was looking to contemporary events, news, for inspiration for material to make a movie.
Corman:
Aip said, "all right, what do you want to make?"
I said, "there's a phenomenon in the country right now-- the hells angels, the outlaw motorcycle gangs.
I want to make a picture about the hells angels."
And they agreed instantly.
Peter bogdanovich:
Roger offered me $125 a week to work as his assistant on the picture.
And he said I could take Polly with me.
His reputation was, you know, complicated, because I kept hearing that he was a millionaire.
And I thought he was pretty eccentric, you know, 'cause he didn't live like a millionaire.
But I had little interest in his movies, to be honest, because I was a big snob and I only liked Fritz lang and Howard hawks and John Ford.
The star of the picture was George chakiris who'd won an Oscar for "westside story."
The phone rang in my house here in Los Angeles, in Beverly hills, and it was Roger.
He said, "we have a problem."
I said, "George can't ride." He said, "how do you know?"
I said, "because I know George.
He can dance, but he can't ride.
You need a biker." "Do you ride?"
I said, "oh, yeah, Roger, I ride.
I'll do it."
I said, "who's gonna play my part?"
He said, "Bruce dern." I said, "great.
I know dernsy."
Bruce dern:
We just had, like, eight actors, and the rest were all extras.
But the extras made the movie, because they had the machines and they were what the movie was about.
And they were real hells angels guys.
They were terrible.
They were frightening.
Dern:
We all rode our bikes down the 2, in the desert.
And he filmed it along the way.
But he didn't get a police escort or anything like that.
He got no permits.
We just did it.
It was the beginning of what you know now as real guerilla filmmaking.
You know, Roger's a guy who's not gonna miss an opportunity to take advantage of every single thing he can shoot.
At one point, there was supposed to be a kind of a fight between the hells angels and the townies.
We didn't have enough townies, so Roger turns to me and he says, "you run in there, be a townie."
So I run in, and within seconds, the angels were beating the shit out of me.
All I did was go right down to the ground and just prayed for "cut!"
Dem:
When work was over, you never saw Roger.
He didn't go to dinner.
He didn't-- you didn't know what he did.
As close as we were to him on that picture, and we were literally his only friends--
I mean, not that nobody liked him, but he was just-- didn't reach out toward friendship.
And he remained mysterious.
But tell me, just what is it that you want to do?
Well, we want to be free.
We want to be free to do what we want to do.
We want to be free to ride.
We want to be free to ride our machines without being hassled by the man.
And we want to get loaded.
- Crowd:
Yeah!
- Man:
I second the motion.
Dern:
I remember asking him, oh, about the third or fourth day of the "wild angels"--
I said, "how many of these things have you done?"
He said, "this is my 100th."
This is 42 years ago, and this was his 100th movie he directed.
Oh, my god.
The film was really an incredible success.
It was the biggest-grossing independent film ever made at that time.
Bogdanovich: "The wild angels" was a tremendous success.
It was a huge hit.
It galvanized the whole underground culture.
Dern:
And that changed his persona and changed the perception of Peter Fonda.
I thought, "this is wonderful.
This is saving me from becoming the next Dean Jones for Disney,"
which is what my agents thought-- that I should be that.
Roger felt that i had helped him and contributed something to it.
And he called me and he said,
"would you like to direct your own picture?"
And I said, "yes." He said, "all right.
We have a Russian science fiction picture.
And aip will buy it, but they won't buy it unless I put some women in it.
There's no women in it.
It's all men walking around Venus."
"But what am I supposed to do, Roger?"
He said, "look at the picture and just decide where to put the women."
"Okay, sure."
"We've got mamie Van doren and she'll be one of the women.
Get a couple of other women and just put them in the picture.
And no sound.
Don't write any dialogue.
I don't want to pay for sound."
And I had to explain to mamie that there would be no dialogue.
She said, "then what do we do?"
I said, "you look meaningfully at one of the other girls.
And then the other girl will immediately react.
So you look at her and the other girl goes...
And goes."
"Telepathy, mamie-- it's telepathy."
We cut this thing together, screened it for Jim Nicholson and he said,
"what the fuck is this about?
What are they doing?
They keep looking and then the other--"
"lt's telepathy, Jim."
"Lt's bullshit." He says, "i don't know what--"
Roger says, "you have to put voices in."
Meriama, wearie...
Bogdanovich:
"Go get the shells." "Yes."
Ptera is a false god.
Roger is the kind of person who says--
"do you know how to swim?" "No-ii and throws you in the water.
And if you learn to swim because you don't want to drown, you're fine.
And if you drown, that's the end of that.
Doel:
I think he was alert that this was a time when things were beginning to change.
Certainly there weren't movies being made reflecting the changes in the thinking of young people.
And I think that Roger was alert to that.
What was going on really was revolutionary.
I smoked pot at work.
- Doel:
Sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll.
- It was blowing up.
Doel:
Vietnam.
Platt:
I thought it was the end of America.
Dern:
I looked at this guy in a cardigan sweater talking about mayhem in the streets.
I was probably the straightest guy in a fairly wild movement.
Doel:
His political views were becoming increasingly left, as he said at the time, "almost communist,"
which always makes me laugh, because of course i don't buy that for a minute, but I understand what he means.
For someone who seems so square on the outside, he was actually a very interesting, cool, hip director.
I may have felt at the beginning of the '60s that I was an underdog, but as we got into the '60s,
I thought, "hey, I'm with the new movement."
Nicholson:
By now Roger and I are in sync.
Hey, the man's supporting my whole life.
How could I not be in sync with him?
He asked me to write "the wild angels,"
'cause I was writing by then.
I said, "Roger, you know, we're pals in this.
Can't you just pay me a little more than scale?"
If he'd just said, "all right, scale plus $5,"
I would have relaxed.
No.
And I didn't write it.
To write "the trip," though, he finally said, "all right."
Cut.
It's good here.
How was it for second camera?
- Man:
Fine here.
- Okay, print it.
Corman:
When I decided to make "the trip" about LSD,
I felt as a director i cannot make a film about LSD without trying LSD.
Initially the idea was that
I would take notes on Roger's trip.
I think he believed that he would be able to coherently dictate notes to me.
How high are you, man?
Can you tell that?
Listen, I think--
I'm afraid.
There's nothing to be afraid of, man.
I had had a wonderful trip, a spectacular trip.
I felt, to be fair, I had to have some experiences of people who'd had bad trips.
Luckily, Jack Nicholson was a very good writer and he knew LSD.
'Cause I was special talent.
Only he and I had actually taken LSD at the point.
I never did it for fun-- too strong.
I mean, a lot of my friends did, but, baby, I mean, what, you want to confront the face of god literally for fun?
Come on.
I'm Peter Fonda.
We've just finished making a movie dealing with the most talked-about subject of the day-
- LSD.
I honestly believe that it will be today's most talked-about motion picture.
Nicholson:
Roger's a serious moviemaker.
He wanted to make a serious film about LSD, which had just changed the culture forever, really.
That's what the movie is about.
Scorsese:
The artistry of the films really developed.
By the time he did "the trip," he really had a sense of pushing the power of the image.
What he hit upon in that picture was interesting, particularly if you see it in the full aspect ratio because it just cuts through time and space.
It becomes really a beautiful kind of cinematic montage and achieves a kind of poetry.
Aip were really concerned that this was a pro-drug movie and they would lose money because of that.
It's easy now.
Wait till tomorrow.
Yeah, well, I'll think about that tomorrow.
Arkoff and Nicholson changed the ending on the picture without telling Roger.
They froze frame and did an optical of broken glass on that.
What is power?
You understand?
He created these guys.
This set me up, because in "easy rider," the first thing we do is we buy junk in Mexico, smuggle it across the border, get a lot of money, put it in the tank, off we go.
Corman: "Easy rider" came out of my films
"the wild angels" and "the trip."
Peter Fonda starred in both pictures and Dennis hopper costarred in "the trip."
That whole thing came from Roger to me-- take the establishment on.
And since they had never made a picture, they wanted me to be the executive producer.
And I said, "fine." And I took the idea to aip because "the wild angels" and "the trip"
had been very successful.
And in one unfortunate meeting, one of the executives at aip said to Dennis,
"lf you fall more than one day behind schedule, we want the right to replace you."
I could see that Dennis and Peter were really mad.
Fonda:
And I said, "i can't put that pressure on hoppy.
That's not fair." And Roger agreed.
Corman:
And I said to this executive,
"he worked perfectly with me on 'the trip' and I am positive he can do this."
And that was not a good thing to say.
A number of things happened and the picture moved over to Columbia.
And aip and I lost our percentage of the profits on one of the most successful independent pictures ever made.
Oh.
Oh, what am I gonna do now?
Nicholson:
When I went to cannes with "easy rider"...
Oh, my head.
...my character came on the screen and the movie exploded in that audience.
It just went ka-pow like it does in rock 'n' roll.
I'm the only person who ever in real life felt,
"holy shit,
I'm a movie star"-- do you know what I mean?
--And knew.
So that's what the change felt like.
I experienced it right here.
Roger, if you paid me over minimum, you would have had "easy rider."
Bogdanovich: "Easy rider" was the beginning of the new Hollywood.
It's hard to imagine the new Hollywood without Roger corman.
So many people started with Roger--
Francis coppola and Bobby de niro and Jack Nicholson.
And the list goes on and on.
At the end of the '60s Hollywood was so desperate.
They didn't know what to do.
And the young Roger corman alumni were there to step into the breach.
Dern:
Jack's career took off.
And Peter and Dennis got deals at universal to make their movies.
Well, those are all offshoots of the university of corman.
Roger was in a perfect position, having discovered and cultivated Francis coppola, bogdanovich, so many other people like that.
I always wondered why Roger couldn't take that next step with those guys.
You had to take that leap.
You had to go from high school to college or you had to go from college to grad school.
It was a jump that Roger never really took.
And that's the one place that Roger left out of his mix.
And that's why he's constantly being insulted by people calling him the king of the bs, right?
Dante:
Roger was never taken seriously.
He was a schlockmeister and a guy who did drive-in movies.
He never really got his due, i don't think.
I mean, even "the intruder," which is one of his best pictures, it was a movie that was hardly ever seen anywhere when it came out.
Dern:
Every year at the academy awards, they give out a lifetime achievement award.
How they can not have gotten to Roger corman by now is disgusting.
And I don't know that they ever will, because they'd say,
"well, what are the great movies he made?"
I guess this proves there are as many nuts in the academy as anywhere else.
Nicholson:
Ls Roger worried about being underappreciated?
If he is, I'm going over there tomorrow night.
Shark!
Shark!
Help!
Cut, cut, cut.
Eli roth:
Roger corman isn't doing it for the awards.
The fans recognize him.
The filmmakers recognize him.
We know who he is and we appreciate him.
And I don't think he needs some statue from some organization that never liked his movies in the first place to come out and say, "we love you."
Julie:
From my viewpoint, everything is going extremely well.
Observing Roger, however, now as actor/producer...
Kevin, you're aware they're putting a mic on the girl who's not in the shot?
Maybe the kit should be just a couple of inches there so you don't step over it.
No, wait until she comes here.
Stop.
It'll be after they say "action!" Because the camera's on her and it's going to come around and see...
Okay, and we're out of the shot.
He is always noticing what needs to be fixed, what is the problem, but that's the nature of producing.
Okay, so I'm looking here.
And on action, you say, "there's someone here to see you."
Man:
Rolling sound.
Paul w.S. Anderson:
You would think that a man who makes so many films kind of doesn't really care about each individual film, but I think Roger for each of his movies-- they're like his children, you know.
And he loves every single one of them.
And he's so engaged in every single one of them.
And, you know, the last time i had lunch with him, you know, he had to hurry away 'cause he was going back to the cutting room of "minotaur."
And it's like, "you know, Roger..."
They're really-- it's just way too much time spent on iva.
They're working on her makeup all the time.
Explain who she should put it on.
They can't do this stuff for every shot.
Mary woronov:
I'll never forget Julie.
She was, like, amazing.
She was talking about redecorating her house.
And then she had a child in a crib.
She was raising children, you know.
And here she was-- she was known to do movies even cheaper than Roger corman.
I mean, this woman was amazing.
The first film that I produced, i didn't think of it as producing.
I didn't put a name to it.
I just thought, "oh, this needs to be organized."
Roger did sit with me for about 45 minutes and go through what's needed-- the cast, the crew, and what the positions were and a way in which to Shepherd production through.
But then I thought, "well, he'll be there every day and I could--"
no, he wasn't really available.
And there was this sense I had of,
"he just thinks i can do this?"
And then I just did it.
But he will recognize in someone that he thinks they can do whatever it is.
And then he just walks away and they do it.
Corman:
I first met Julie when she answered an ad for a job as my assistant.
I offered her the job.
She turned down the job, but she agreed to have dinner with me.
We began dating and we also began working together.
Roger had by then asked me to marry him and I had said yes.
And then he went off to the Philippines and I didn't hear from him for a week.
So I was like, "i wonder what that means."
So I called him and said, "are we still getting married?"
He said, "oh, yes.
Did you pick a date?"
And I said, "well, I was thinking of December or maybe later in the spring."
"Oh, definitely December.
Sooner-- better, right?"
I said, "okay.
L just wonder why you didn't call me."
Well, he didn't call me because it was a long-distance call, so it wouldn't have occurred to him.
But anyway, you know, getting to know each other.
All right now, everybody, reach for the nightgown of the lord.
Reach.
Anybody moves-- you're dead.
Julie:
Roger had done "bloody mama"
with shelley winters and Bobby de niro.
And, you know, it was a great success for aip.
And aip wanted another woman gangster movie.
And so I found this book.
It was the story of a woman who'd been something of a tramp, a hobo, had ridden the boxcars of the railroads of the United States during the depression.
It was her story as a rebel, as a pre-feminist, as it were, and as an outlaw.
"Boxcar Bertha" the first picture that Julie worked on with me as co-producer.
It was also the first picture that Marty scorsese directed.
I met him and he said, "look, I have a sequel to 'bloody mama.' it's called 'boxcar Bertha.' Would you be interested in doing it?"
I said, "absolutely," you know.
And "bloody mama" actually had de niro in it, see?
By the time we got to Camden, Arkansas,
Marty had sketched every shot of the picture, which was all over the walls of his motel room.
I took out all these drawings, about 500.
And he looked at the first 20 or 30 or something.
And then he looked, he said, "did you do this for the entire picture?"
I said, "yeah." He said, "all right."
He put it away and he left.
Run, Bertha!
God damn that bitch.
Carradine:
The thing that Roger hated was when Sam arkoff came in-- 'cause he needed Sam because the budget was too big for him.
And then Sam kind of took over and masterminded the release in a way that Roger didn't like.
And Roger said, "I'm never gonna do this again."
And that's when he formed new world and he went back to making $25,000 movies and worked his way back up again just simply so that nobody could tell him, you know, how he should cut his movie or how he should release it.
Doel:
Roger somehow is fueled by outwitting, I would say, even more than rebelling against, authority.
He was that way with aip.
I think, actually, it brings out his creativity and his drive.
It just seems to fire him up to just show them that he will do it himself.
He doesn't need them to tell him how to do it or what to do.
I decided to start a small production/distribution company, a little bit the way aip had started in the late 1950s.
Roger is a brilliant producer in terms of knowing what the market is, anticipating the trends and then capitalizing on them.
He was a trendsetter for years.
I mean, he-- in the '60s he set every trend.
He has the idea-- the original idea for almost all the films that are produced by new world pictures.
He had a somewhat finite audience.
They weren't expecting things to be held over.
You know, things played for two weeks in the grindhouses and a couple weeks at the drive-in and then a new thing came in.
But within that, you were gonna have a very loyal audience of young people.

There are '70s exploitation pictures that are really out there.
I mean, they have plot twists that are like, "whoa, i didn't see that coming.
I didn't think people did that in the movies."
Announcer:
Woman was made for man to hunt.
Dante:
Roger certainly took amazing advantage of that.
Announcer:
Hunters competing for the game.
Set your sights on the tastiest game, from new world pictures.
Roger's operation is an exploitation operation on almost every level.
He exploits directors.
He exploits writers.
He exploits people in the crafts who are trying to get established.
But we are also exploiting Roger.
Julie:
I think he had a lot of fun working with these young people.
And so it was often known as, you know, the corman school of filmmaking.
Demme:
The first time I met Roger, this crazy Roger German-y thing happened where he said, "okay, you can write press releases.
Do you think you could write a screenplay?"
And this had never really occurred to me, but I said, "yes."
And he said, "let me explain.
I'm starting a new company.
It's called new world pictures.
I need a bunch of pictures to go into the works very soon."
He wanted a nurse movie, but he also wanted to crossbreed it with a prison movie.
Announcer:
Four American nurses, snatched from their work in a foreign hospital, jumped in the jungle, caught between a kill-crazed revolutionary and a sex-crazed major.
Roger says, "exploitation pictures don't need plots.
But they need sensational things like girls shooting filipinos out of trees.
That works."
In new world-- they very often go back and add action to a picture.
'Cause you'll see how a rough cut plays, and Roger almost always wants you to add another chase or at least another explosion.

"Grand Theft Auto"
is a love story with cars.
Also it's a comedy with car crashes.
Announcer:
"Grand Theft Auto,"
directed by and starring Ron Howard.
Well, hell.
We had a very limited number of extras that we were allowed to have at the big demolition derby climactic action scenes.
And I called Roger asking for more extras to fill out the stands, 'cause, I said, "this is supposed to be this huge event.
There's a big riot at the end.
You know, 75 extras is gonna fill exactly, you know, 1/10 of the stands.
It's gonna look cheesy."
And he said no.
And he could see I was dejected.
And he smiled and he put his hand on my shoulder in a kind of fatherly way.
And he said, "Ron, here's what you need to understand.
You do a good job for me on my terms on this movie, and you never have to work for me again."
And, well, I didn't.
I certainly wish that Roger would move out of the formula film-- the exploitation film.
I guess that he just feels that as long as he's investing his own money that he wants it to be surefire.
Carradine:
In "death race" at the very beginning behind us, there's a city of the future.
And it is so obviously a painting.
It's almost a cartoon.
And I said that to him and he said,
"people come to my pictures looking for camp.
And I'm going to give it to them."
Lf he just violated this rule of his of never making a movie that cost more than $1 million, you know, and make one for $1.5 million or $2 million--
I said, "look, all your pictures make money.
None of them go through the top."
And he said, "yeah, that's true."
And then he went over and turned off the air conditioner.
Sometimes the movies were really dreadful and you had to just sort of camp them up and make fun of them.
- "Cover girl models."
- And we did-- by the time we got to "cover girl models," we were doing outrageous ad lines-- you know, "they don't need clothes to strike a pose";
"they're always overexposed but they're never underdeveloped"-- to the point where the pictures looked like jokes.
They didn't look like they were real movies.
They're like movies in the front of "tropic thunder."
They just didn't look real.
But the audiences never minded.
They were happy.
The limitations of a low-budget film can work positively in terms of getting something spontaneous.
There's no time for rehearsal.
There's no time for extended discussions of motivation and character and so forth.
And indeed there aren't many characters or motivations in any of the films.
You'll never be a star now, you little cunt.
Dante:
The great thing about working for Roger was that every possible obstacle to making a movie was thrown in front of you.
Beverly hills police.
And if you could figure out a way to get around them, you could make your movie.
At the end credits of "Hollywood boulevard,"
that background shot was shot while the camera crew was hiding in the bushes and I was talking to the Beverly hills police and explaining that I was just out here admiring the scenery.
And they said, "well, get back in your car and drive down the hill."
It's not as bad as John Davis and having to spend the night in jail while making "fly me," though.
I think when he called Roger and he said, "I'm in jail,"
I think Roger said, "well, you know, that's a good experience.
You should learn from this."
Blossom, honey.
You philandering, fornicating bastard, you went off with that skinny honky for two days and gonna come back here and call me honey?
Now wait a minute, blossom, honey.
I told you I was gonna cut it off if you tried to pull that shit on me.
We called it "make do."
You know, whatever you can do to make do, that's what we did.
And from it, i lived through my stunts.
I look back at it-- would I do them again?
Yes, but more padding on the head.
Not a lot of women wanted to do stunts.
All right, everybody, back 'em up.
Grier:
And they couldn't handle guns.
They were afraid of guns.
Sit down on the floor.

Grier:
And there weren't a lot of women who wanted to be tossed around the room or thrown over a cliff.
And he said, "let's keep her doing movies.
She loves to do crazy stuff.
Let's set her on fire."
You know, "how many cars can she crash today?"
They loved that.
He could talk you into, you know, buying some sand in a desert.
Hey, and it'll taste good, too.

I did bring "mean streets" first to Roger.
And it was the beginning of the blaxploitation pictures.
And he said, "so the story is interesting and everything.
It's really interesting.
I can give you a couple hundred thousand dollars to do it, but if you could swing a little bit and make it black, it might be-- we might have something here."
So I thought about it.
I said, "okay, let me think about it."
I wouldn't say no.
I always say yes to these things.
And I walked out and realized my heart sank because I realized, no, they're Italian-Americans.
That's the part of the cultural thing.
It's sicilians and neapolitans and ancient code that goes back to the medieval times.
You're a fucking jerk-off.
And I'll tell you something else, Mikey--
I fuck you right where you breathe, 'cause I don't give two shits about you or nobody else.
I said, "that's-- totally not.
I'm not gonna be able to do it."
But because of "boxcar Bertha"
and because of the group that worked on the film,
I learned how to make the picture within a certain amount of time.
And we were able to take the same principles that we applied to "boxcar Bertha" and use them for "mean streets."
We wound up shooting most of it in Los Angeles because we had that crew and the corman crew knew how to work.
Dante:
Roger's own personal taste in pictures is very different from the type of pictures that he makes.
And also his taste in directors tends towards antonioni and bergman.
Corman:
Most of our films are domestic.
However, we do distribute a number of foreign films-- bergman, fellini, truffaut, now kurosawa and a number of others.
Dante:
Roger had a lot of connections and he had his own distribution company.
And when the majors started to give up on foreign films,
Roger talked people like ingmar bergman and fellini into--
"i can get your picture on screens that have never run a movie of yours, because I have a different audience and a different way of selling the movie."
And they all signed off on it.
Ingmar bergman was a seminal influence on Roger as a director.
"Cries and whispers" did extremely well and ingmar bergman was very pleased.
And then Roger being Roger, he had the idea to distribute it in drive-ins.
And that's what he did.
No one else had ever been able to do that before, and probably not since.
That was something new for Roger, to have such prestige people associated with him.
And it just went from there.
Roger, when he formed new world pictures, was the first company that was completely bifurcated.
In other words, in one direction they were doing exploitation films, but in the other direction they were doing the best foreign-language films that were out there at that time.
Corman:
The money is secondary in that particular area.
It's because I feel these films should get to a larger audience than they do.
Announcer:
The new fellini--
"amarcord."
Corman:
The company is building very rapidly, which takes a lot of time.
My wife and I have had three children in three consecutive summers, which takes a certain amount of time.
We would go home in the evening and talk about the problems of the day.
Then there got to be a time when we, like, just didn't talk about what had happened during the day.
But it got to be a little embarrassing because Roger didn't really know what all I was doing and I didn't really know what all he was doing.
And I said, "look, Roger, it's very embarrassing when people say, 'what movies is Roger making?
' and I don't know.
You know, it is our company, but there's what you're making and what I'm making."
And so he said, "well, I'll tell you what I'm making."
He said, "I'm making 12 films."
And he couldn't remember the last two.
So he said, "well, whatever they are, I'm gonna cancel them."
Reporter:
You had made a statement to the press that you were getting out of exploitation films and into higher-budget films.
What brought you back into it?
In my last years as a director,
I was climbing out of the low-budget field and was doing more expensive films, but when I started my own company, which was financed essentially out of my own savings,
I was forced back to low-budget films because those were all I could afford.
New world has had several profitable years and we're now starting to make more expensive films and we're climbing once more.
Roger's had such success with new world pictures in the past couple of years that now people are dying to invest in his movies.
And if a script is going around town which has his endorsement on it and a promise that he will distribute it, you're in fabulous shape.
There's an old story about the producer with a successful Broadway play.
And his friend comes to him and says,
"here's the way we can fix the second act."
And the producer says, "never -- around with a winner."
Roger came bounding up the stairs.
And he said,
"Ron, you're here.
Have you heard the news?"
I said, "no." "Great news:
'Grand Theft Auto'--"
which was a very successful movie for him--
"'Grand Theft Auto' just sold to CBS.
It's the first time we've ever sold a movie to the networks-- for $1.1 million."
And I said, "well, that's great, Roger."
He said, "lt's fantastic.
That makes your 7.5% look awfully good."
'Cause I had a little profit participation in "Grand Theft Auto."
I said, "yeah, it does." He said,
"it makes my 92.5% look goddamn wonderful."

Announcer:
There is a creature alive today.
It lives to kill-- a mindless eating machine.
It is as if god created the devil and gave him jaws.
The blockbuster movie of the summer is "jaws,"
the tale of a murderous white shark...
The record-breaking box office receipts created by "jaws"...
- ...the movie "jaws."
- Some people who have seen it are now seeing phantom sharks every time...
- Steven Spielberg...
- "Time magazine" seldom...
When that movie was released...
Announcer:
See it before you go swimming.
When Steven Spielberg made "jaws,"
he took a very cormanesque idea-- you know, the killer shark.
I mean, it doesn't get any more corman than that-- killer shark eating naked girls as they go skinny-dipping.
Roth:
Once people got a taste of movies like "jaws,"
they really didn't want the drive-in movies anymore.
They stopped going.
They wanted to go to the theaters and be part of some cultural phenomenon that everyone was talking about and everyone was going to see.
And it wasn't about taking your girl to the drive-in.
And then everything kind of changed
- on the day "star wars" came out.
- Yeah.
We went to an 11 :00 show right over at the Chinese and it was extraordinary.
- When these lines appeared...
- Yeah.
...everybody was astounded.
I mean, they couldn't understand.
"Jaws"-- it was like, okay, it's a best-seller and we sort of know that's gonna make a lot of money.
But "star wars" came from nowhere.
And all of a sudden this gigantic change happened.
It was just like the "easy rider" change.
It was like going to a revival meeting.
That first screening just was amazing.
Corman:
When I saw "star wars"
I said, "this is a threat to me because it means that the major studios are beginning to understand what we've been doing for $100,000 or so and they're now doing it for multi-millions of dollars.
And it's going to be very difficult for us to compete."
Corman:
I felt the major studios are hitting straight into what has been my bread and butter for 20 years and also the staple of many of my compatriots.
McCarthy:
"Jaws" and then "star wars"
set a whole new standard.
I mean, just the bar got set higher.
You couldn't really get away with doing cheap science fiction films anymore.
Nicholson:
I hated "star wars."
Lf "star wars" doesn't make a ton of cabbage, you know, we'd still be having these weird green flashing lines going across the screen.
All these guys are coming from film school.
We're all coming from, "let us get a job."
He did it first with horror pictures, with science fiction pictures which he did for no money and, you know, quickly and unpretentiously.
That's who we are today.
And I miss the Roger corman versions.
What we see now is the tent poles of the studios.
The summer and Christmas tent poles are very often films that could have been done by Roger corman at a much smaller budget.
But those are the films now that are attracting the top filmmakers and the biggest budgets.
And what has the wonderful revolution done for independence of filmmaking?
Well, we make 12 circuses a year and very few movies.
When you read that a picture cost $35 million to make, what do you think of that cost?
Actually I think it's wrong.
I think the artist should be able to express himself for less money than that.
And the businessman should be able to invest his money better.
I think from both an artistic and a commercial standpoint, it is wrong to spend that much money.
And in addition,
I think there are better things to do with the money in our society.
- For example?
- You could-- for $30 million or $40 million, which is what some of these films are costing, you could rebuild a portion of the slums of a city,
- just as one example.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
So you think it's obscene to spend that much money.
Yes, I would use that word.
Once the "star wars" juggernaut thing happened and the idea that everything had to be an event movie, it just became difficult.
The business changed.
He ended up having to go direct to video with a lot of the stuff.
There's just 100 billion shelves with 100 billion DVDs and it's very hard to stick out.
He switched over to making slasher movies.
And that was a very limited genre, so it was harder to make something that was interesting in that genre.
I met him at a dinner party in New York in the early '80s.
And I said, "aren't you gonna do any more?
Are you gonna direct a few more?"
He said, "i don't think so.
The whole scene is changing-- screwdrivers going into people's heads.
It just doesn't-- it doesn't-- i don't belong there anymore."
George hickenlooper:
I think he's become more obscure.
And I think that's too bad, because I think he really has a very important legacy in Hollywood.
When a lot of his stuff went straight to DVD,
I think he lost a little bit of his mystique and cachet.
Penelope spheeris:
If you walked up to any 20, 25-year-old film buff and asked if they knew who Roger was,
I think unfortunately they probably don't.
Gosh, I mean, how many other people have made 400-- 385 movies, you know?
If he hadn't done seven million other pictures, he'd have the same reputation as any of the other artistes.
Snyder:
Are the people with whom you've worked over the years still friendly with you?
Do they like you?
Do they call you on the phone now and again and say,
"hi, Roger.
How is it going?"
I think so.
I still talk with them.
Careers move in different directions, but most of them are still friends of mine.
They use words with you like, forgive me, "the schlockmeister."
Does that bother you when they say those things?
- Yes.
- Does it?
- Yeah, it bothers me, right.
- It should.
You're just trying...
Roth:
Roger corman made it okay for all of us to make exploitation movies.
He showed that you shouldn't be embarrassed.
There's nothing wrong with you for loving a movie like "piranha."
That it doesn't mean that you're stupid for loving a movie that seems like a stupid exploitation movie.
And that a lot of these films are very smart, made with lots of intelligence and that it's okay to have fun at the movies.
I think it's very important to let the generation of today know who he is.
We all-- we knew it almost 40 years ago.
So it's time to reintroduce him as a director, but also what he represents of American entertainment.
He represents a side of Hollywood sort of unto his own, you know.
You know, there are a lot of Samuel goldwyns, a lot of Irving thalbergs.
There's really only one Roger corman.
That style of filmmaking, that attitude, that approach to filmmaking really is unparalleled.
You know, I know it's right to have the tie hand-tied, but frankly the pre-tied ties look better because they're perfect.
I guess the whole idea is if it's slightly imperfect, it's considered to be handmade.
Julie:
Yes.
There's delight in disorder.
Right.
Now...
- There you go.
- Okay.
We're gonna give the lifetime achievement award to Roger corman.
And they've asked me to be part of it.
I got to call him.
And I said to him,
"the board of governors of the motion picture academy has voted to give you an honorary Oscar for your life achievement."
And there was silence.
He wasn't-- he goes, "excuse me?
That's unbelievable."
The funny part is, of course, that Roger is, you know, the ultimate fierce independent.
So I told him, "yes," I said,
"i know when you get up there, you're really gonna stick it to the man."
Howard:
Roger, if you could stand,
I'd like to offer you a toast.
For all your progressive influence in our medium and for our industry, it's our honor to salute you tonight, Roger.
Hear, hear.
Tarantino:
The academy thanks you.
Hollywood thanks you.
Independent filmmaking thanks you.
But most importantly, for all the wild, weird, cool, crazy moments you've put on the drive-in screens, the movie lovers of the planet earth thank you.
He is one of the finest personages in our field.
Roger, please come up to accept your Oscar.
Needless to say, I'm delighted to accept this Oscar personally, but I'd also like to accept it on behalf of my wife Julie, who's been my--
--my producing partner for many years.
I think that to succeed in this world you have to take chances.
I believe the finest films being done today are done by the original, innovative filmmakers who have the courage to take a chance and to gamble.
So I say to you, keep gambling.
Keep taking chances.
Thank you.
When I think of sort of sublime moments in my professional life,
I think of winning an academy award, and right next to it is the wrap party for "Grand Theft Auto."
Actually everybody grab for it.
Howard:
I'd always dreamed of making a movie and Roger let me make a movie.
And not only did I make it,
I loved it more than I ever dreamed I might.
Is this sort of like the way you get an honorary degree at Harvard?
Am I an honorary member of the Roger corman school of filmmaking?
You know, I don't know.
I'm actually a little tongue-tied when I'm with Roger.
I just have-- you know, we're completely different kind of people.
And I have such respect for him.
You know, every once in a while
Roger would come to my rescue pretty much, you know, when things were-- nothing was happening.
Polly platt:
My husband left me and the phone stopped ringing, but the only person who called me was Roger.
And he said, "you can direct a picture any time you want.
I'll produce it for you."
So he's the only person who called me.
Demme:
We'll put them on our Facebook pages.
I mean, there's nobody in there that he didn't in the most important way support.
He was, you know, my main connec-- my lifeblood to whatever I thought i was gonna be
3s a person.
And, you know, i hope he knows that this is not all hot air.
I'm gonna cry now.
Not just me, who's very sentimental, but these other people also love him.
50ml-
corman:
Mike, i'vejust gotten off the phone with syfy.
They're very worried about the climax of the script.
They believe the Mayan dance sequence in the jungle is not big enough.
I'm going to make the stage bigger and bring in almost a Mayan village rather than a temple.
He wants to stay in the game.
To some extent, he does see making movies as a game, a game that you can win or lose.
And staying in means that you're winning.
Julie:
These are for "splatter."
- Oh, for "splatter," okay.
- Yes.
He really epitomized what's wonderful about the American dream-- that you can succeed no matter what.
Even if you fail, you can reinvent yourself.
Anderson:
If you love it and you're allowed to keep working, or you have the energy to keep working, as Roger does, there is no retirement age.
No one kind of gives you your gold watch and tells you to go home because your career's over.
Let's go back, cut on the frame after she exits the shot-- barn!
Right there.
There's an arab Maxim, which is,
"the dogs bark, but the caravan moves on."
And this is Roger to me, as the caravan, you know.
He's making the decision and moving forward.
And you're saying, "but wait a minute, you haven't thought about what the actors will think.
And what about if the truck isn't available?"
"We're gonna shoot this here now."

Quiet.
In a filmmaking career that has spanned over 30 years, my next guest is the man responsible for such cinematic classics as "The House of Usher," "Wild Angels,"
"The Monster from the Ocean Floor,"
"The Attack of the Crab Monsters."
Please welcome Roger Corman.
-( Upbeat music playing ) -( cheering and applause)
Low-budget movies in those days- it wasn't like today.
.( Growling ) -( screaming)
Nobody was really trying to make them good.
There was the real emphasis on the price.
( Roaring )
(thunder crashes)
Roger Corman has made more than 200 motion pictures in his career, most of them for extremely low budget.
He's produced around 150-175 films.
He made so many movies.
In 1957, he directed 10 movies.
Most people don't get to do that.
He made 250 movies and never lost a dime.
Okay, this is not a $20-million movie.
You know, this is a $1.93 science fiction movie.
(screaming )
We knew these were made fast and cheap, and we also knew that taste was out of the question.
There was no need for taste.
The way Disney movies, you know, bring out the child in all of us, you know, so can exploitation.
Sometimes he'll give the notes right on the script and you get little marginal references like
"Breast nudity possible here?" Question mark.
The goal was, Roger said, "Every motorcycle that runs,
And then when it stops running, blow it up."
(woman screaming)
Aah!
He said, "Your job, if the cops come, is to pick up the camera and run."
I said, "We're in the middle of the desert.
What do you mean, there is no water?"
It's a Roger Corman movie, you know.
There's no water.
One take on everything.
That's just the way he worked.
You know, you didn't argue with him.
And we were delighted to be working.
It doesn't matter if people are happy.
It doesn't matter if you have a permit.
None of it matters.
You know, the only thing that counts is what you get inside the frame.
He's still around, making pictures in his 30$ and he's-- I just saw him the other day.
He hasn't changed at all.
(woman screaming)
Man:
One, two, three.
- And action!
-( woman screaming)
Man:
One, two, three.
I'm in the water with a giant creature on my arms... (woman laughs) ...pumping blood out, chomping on a beautiful girl in a bikini.
I mean, it's the essence of Roger Corman cinema.
Roger Corman:
We feel that the monster should kill somebody fairly early and then at regular intervals through the picture.
The first kill should be quite shocking.
The other kills can be a little bit less shocking as we build up.
And then of course the climax- everything goes, blood all over the screen.
Frances Doel:
Roger had made two previous movies for the Syfy channel that did very well for them.
And he said, "Okay, Frances it's 'Dino-shark.'
You know what that is."
And of course I say, "Yes, I know what that is.
It's a giant shark."
"Yes, but not too much like 'Jaws."' "No, of course not."
- Woman:
122-Charlie, take three.
- Man:
Marker.
Julie Corman:
"Dinoshark" is about a shark that is unloosed because of global warming from an avalanche north of Alaska...
Eric Balfour:
That's your killer.
It hasn't eaten in 150 million years and it's hungry.
Julie:
...and somehow mysteriously makes its way south to Puerto Vallarta and pretty much terrorizes everybody and everything in sight.
David Carradine:
You know, that whole world is just so different from the "Entertainment Weekly" world or the Academy Award world.
The Golden Globes don't even hear about these things.
You know, these pictures- they just go someplace else.
And there's an incredible number of people that want to see a picture just like this.
Doel:
The Paradise Village location also had some accommodation for actors and crew and so on.
So that's always been one of those little tricks up Roger's sleeve- how he can do what he does on a budget.
Roger always said, you know, "You could make 'Lawrence of Arabia' for a half a million dollars.
You just don't leave the tent."
Balfour:
If you could imagine
Knott's Berry Farm set on a beach, but the only people in the park were senior citizens, no rides, but it had a theme-park-like atmosphere, that is what we have affectionately dubbed
Paradise Prison.
Who is two minutes from being ready for what?
( Radio hissing )
Balfour:
At first I thought it was maybe some kind of electromagnetic field that doesn't allow the walkie-talkie service.
Man:
I need a radio that works.
( Radio hissing )
But it turns out that we just bought, you know, children's walkie-talkies.
This is full-on guerilla-style filmmaking.
I mean, you know, we're sort of running and gunning and stealing locations and driving boats
- where they shouldn't be driven.
- Man:
Go, go, go, get out!
(chuckles) Oh, my God.
At one point they wanted somebody to get in this water...
- Man:
Action!
- ...to get attacked by something.
Well, it turns out there was actually things to get attacked by.
Not that this wasn't obvious.
There was a giant sign that said "Crocodiles."
Should she be there?
Well, that's where she was in the wide shot.
- The way this will be cut, it'll work.
- Okay.
All right.
You wouldn't think of the movies, if you met him, that he'd have done all these movies- very polite, very-- almost British.
He really came across, I felt, as more like an English film professor, you know.
I expected him to be teaching at Oxford or Cambridge rather than kind of making all of these kind of violent exploitation movies that he had made.
I thought he'd be more like Lee J. Cobb, let's say, or somebody a little-- where they're smoking a cigar and pounding on the desk and--
"You kids get in there and do that work," and, you know-- and actually he's very eloquent, elegant and precise, cool-headed, from what I saw, and very, very different from the type of person
you'd think would be behind these pictures like "Teenage Cave Man."
Corman:
The difference between the image you present to the world and what is going on inside, in your unconscious mind, is significant.
I've been told that my image is
I'm just sort of an ordinary straight guy.
Clearly my unconscious mind is some sort of a boiling inferno there.
Like most kids, I was interested in films essentially all my life.
I graduated from Stanford University in California in engineering.
I worked four days as an engineer and quit.
The only job I could get in films was a messenger at 20th Century Fox.
And I worked my way up from that to become a story analyst.
I read scripts, commented on them, and handed in a synopsis of the script or the novel or whatever had been proposed with my opinion.
As the youngest reader, I was given frankly the most hopeless scripts to cover.
And the story editor said,
"Roger, you have never recommended one script."
And I said, "You've never given me a script that's worth recommending."
So they sent me a script which was the first thing I'd ever read at Fox that I thought was really any good at all.
And I made a number of notes on it.
The picture became "The Gunfighter" starring Gregory Peck.
And the story editor got a bonus for my notes.
And I got no recognition for the fact that a number of my ideas were used in the script.
This became a big hit for Fox.
You would have thought he would have had some acknowledgment.
This caused him to leave Fox and become what he is today.
After "The Gunfighter,"
he corralled some money from our parents and some of his money and a few friends', got an enormous number of deferments and made his first film-- "Monster from the Ocean Floor."
And that was basically the beginnings of Roger Corman.
I was the producer, the assistant director and everything.
I would drive the truck to the location and unload everything I could by myself.
And I would save about an hour on the crew salary every morning.
The second picture I made was a picture called "The Fast and the Furious."
It was about road racing and of course had very, very little money.
Jonathan Haze:
Roger went to some sports car dealerships and borrowed sports cars.
And we took the Windshields off them and actually raced them.
And then we'd clean them up and take them back.
Roger was just so inane at the time and was trying to do it himself and was starting to run out of money.
If you don't understand money in the movie business, it's like an artist who doesn't understand paint.
Roger told me, "Well, I understand paint.
If I got to thin her up with turpentine or there's no picture, why, she gets thinned up a little.
That's all there is to it."
I could see the problem for the independent.
You raised the money.
You made the picture.
And then you had to wait for the picture to earn its money back before you could make another picture.
But Sam Arkoff and Jim Nicholson were starting a new company- American International.
And they made me an offer for "The Fast and the Furious"
to start their company with.
I said, "I want a three-picture deal in which I'm guaranteed my money back.
As soon as I finish one film,
I go to the next one using the guarantee."
And that essentially started me on a regular basis of making films and started American International.
Don't call me "squaw."
You're a dirty apache squaw.
I'm gonna kill you.
Your people did that-- raiding, thieving, killing.
( Crowd shouting )
Haze:
I was very famous for fighting with the girls.
This was "Apache Woman."
Joan Taylor and I did a knife fight in the street.
And this is Dick Miller in the background where he belonged.
( laughs )
A friend of mine, Jonathan Haze, said,
"Well, maybe I'll introduce you to Roger Corman and he can help you."
We went down there.
He said, "What do you do?"
I said, "I'm a writer."
He said, "We don't need any writers right now."
He says, "I need actors." I said, "I'm an actor."
He says, "You want to play an Indian for me?"
At the end I got killed.
Roger said, "How would you like to play a cowboy for me?"
I said, "Oh, are we going to another picture?"
He says, "No, no, this picture."
I said, "Oh, God.
Okay."
(gunfire)
I wound up killing myself in the last scene.
I don't know what the budgets were, but they were really low.
We shot them in seven days, so that gives you an idea.
And that's everything, including special effects or anything else, you know.
Some weren't all that great, and Roger'd be the first guy to tell you that.
I never had the opportunity to go to film school.
My student work was being shown on the screen.
And some of it wasn't quite as good as it might have been, but I was learning all the time.
Beat it, I said.
You're on a battlefield.
I know that better than you do, Sergeant.
How well are you doing?
Half my men are dead.
Nothing can stop that thing.
Call off your troops.
Scorsese:
It's as if these films were being made on your street corner, in a way.
They weren't encumbered by having to deal with "art"
with a capital A-R-T.
They just weren't-
- I mean, they're art in another way.
Corman:
I learned fairly quickly how to handle the camera, what to do with editing, but I didn't know enough about acting, and I felt I should simply take a class.
And that was where I met Jack Nicholson.
Nicholson:
He came into the class with that little smile, and everybody's as serious as a heart attack, you know.
He had-- when I was first working for him, he told me he had 12 companies, the contracts of which were all in his back pocket.
I mean, he was a one-man band.
Don't make me.
Don't be a fool, kid.
You think I would carry a real gun?
( Gunshots )
As a matter of fact, the first picture Jack Nicholson starred in was for me-- a picture called "The Cry Baby Killer"
about a kid who takes a drive-in hostage.
It's coming.
Can't you get him to be quiet until it comes?
Nicholson:
I hadn't really worked at all before.
Then I got a lead in the movie.
I thought, "Oh, this is it.
I'm here.
I'm gonna be big," you know.
Then I didn't even get an interview for the next year.
Look, Carole was a swell girl until Manny got his hands on her.
You mean, till she wanted Manny's hands on her.
Listen, Fred...
"Cry Baby Killer" was just humiliating... ( laughs ) ...but good for me.
Hey, Roger's the only guy who hired me for about 10 years.
Teenagers-- never had 'em when I was a kid.
The word "teenager" didn't really exist until the '50s.
If you look at the '40s and '30s, their idea of a teenage movie was "Andy Hardy."
Hey, Betsy.
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!
What do you think's happened?
- What do you think's happened?
- What?
Well, tell me what.
Cynthia won't go to the dance and I don't know why and I don't want to.
Times were changing.
- Dave!
- Okay, Johnny.
Corman:
The major studios didn't really understand the audience was looking for a different type of film.
If we were going to make pictures about young people,
I'd have picked a young guy like Jack Nicholson.
But you're through breaking the law.
Sarge, I don't break the law.
I make my own.
Roger really realized that young people at that time really liked movies where teenagers were in trouble with the authorities.
He had found an audience that you didn't have to go through the studio system to reach.
Not only was he a rebel from Hollywood in that he did it all himself and did it outside of the studio system, but there was an edge of rebellion, you know, to the movies.
Dante:
You make it as disreputable as possible so that the parents wouldn't want them to see it and that they feel that when they go there, they're doing something transgressive, and you've got an audience.
You're making outlaw movies, basically.
And Roger has always been an outlaw.
Let go of me. you big ape!
Now beat it, smart boy, and don't come back or I'll break your head.
Break whose head, you phony Frenchman?
You ain't so tough.
Took this moose-head to throw me out
Corman:
I've always been anti-establishment.
I spent two years in the Navy.
Those were the worst two years of my life.
I came very close to setting the record for the most demerits, because I felt if they set up a rule,
I really must break that rule.
Ron Howard:
Roger understood the need for audiences to identify with rebellion.
Beating the system- that's cathartic, you know, defining yourself on your own terms.
These things are elemental.
They're all what we go through during those rites of passage.
I think that he understood that when he was dealing with those basic experiences and feelings that he was talking to a young audience.
We know he always had something up his sleeve.
He was more irreverent.
He was more hip-- very hip, very cool.
"A Bucket of Blood" is a really good example of parody of the hip scene, the beat scene in LA.
Walter, you've done something to me, something deep down inside of my prana.
I have?
Oh, Walter, I want to be with you.
You're creative.
Almost all of Roger's pictures has a little edge to them.
They were-- they just bordered on something sacrosanct, that you shouldn't touch this,
And that's usually what pulled the picture through.
Feed me.
I'm sorry, pal.
I'm fresh out of blood.
Talk to somebody else.
( Plant whines) I'm hungry.
I don't care what you are.
Can't you see I'm knocked out?
I just killed a man.
I'm a murderer.
He was always pushing.
Roger's idea at the time was to cut down the time of shooting.
So now his ambition was to make a film in two days.
Now no Novocain.
It dulls the senses.
Haze:
It was work.
I mean, we would get there early in the morning and we'd just start grinding out these scenes.
One day was half the movie.
-( Buzzing ) -( laughs)
Oh, my God, don't stop now.
Roger had borrowed all the dental equipment from his personal dentist and they hadn't bolted it down to the floor.
(screaming )
We banged into this big dental shit and it started to fall over.
And Roger cut the camera and ran out and saved the dental equipment.
To hell with the scene.
( laughs )
I can truly say I've never enjoyed myself so much.
Nicholson:
I'd have terrible experiences going into the theater with movies that I had made in that period with Roger, 'cause, you know, they were kind of-- a lot of them were grim.
- Bye.
- Bye now.
By mistake he actually made a good picture every once in a while.
I was never in it, but that was as much my fault as the next guy's.
Corman:
By the beginning of the '60s
I began to have confidence in my ability to master the craft.
At least she has found peace now.
Has she?
Jonathan Demme:
We'd never miss a Poe movie.
They were riveting and stylish and hip and funny.
And we couldn't wait for the next one.
And of course with Roger, you didn't have to wait very long.
The next one was gonna come out, like, a month later.
Do you know where you are, Bartolome?
The pit and the pendulum.
Howard:
The Poe movies were huge for me, especially "The Pit and the Pendulum."
They had this TV campaign where the blade was coming down, you know, and just kind of-- whew.
And, oh, my God, it was- and I rushed.
In fact, that's probably the first time that a TV campaign made me go to the movie.
They were so successful,
I ended up making six Edgar Allan Poe films.
Scorsese:
The artistry of the films really developed into the Poe pictures:
"The House of Usher," "The Pit and the Pendulum,"
and "The Tomb of Ligeia," which is my favorite.
She desecrates the earth in which she lies.
(cat screams)
(bells tolling)
A nervous contraction, nothing more.
Scorsese:
He was a name that we'd go like--
I must say like a Hitchcock film.
We'd go see a Roger Corman.
Corman:
They wanted me to make more, but by that time I said, "Enough.
I'm starting to repeat myself."
We played it for a little bit of humor in some of the later pictures, particularly "The Raven."
Nicholson:
I was doing "The Raven."
(woman screams)
And he said, "Jack, look, these sets are gonna be up over the weekend, so I can use the same sets for free.
I'm gonna have somebody write something."
And he went and he got a guy who wrote 63 pages of just dialogue.
To this day, no one knows the plot of "The Terror."
It was very strange.
I mean, we played the weirdest characters.
I played a guy that was an assistant to a witch.
In the beginning of the film, I'm a deaf-mute.
And then halfway through the film, they decided that they didn't have an ending for the film.
They'd better make me talk.
(whispering ) I can say no more.
There is great danger.
Find Eric.
Eric knows.
Haze:
Dick played a livery butler with a New York accent.
Nicholson:
And you'll see in the picture now--
God forbid, I don't want to encourage anyone to see it--
I throw Dick Miller up against this door.
Where's the baron?
We must get to him.
He's locked himself in the crypt.
And Dick Miller now tries to explain the entire picture in one speech.
The baron did return that night to find Eric with the baroness and he did kill her.
But there was a struggle, and in the fight it was not Eric who died, but the baron.
I killed the baron.
'Cause there is-- there's no story actually arrived at.
Corman:
Various directors shot the film.
Francis Coppola started and shot some sequences at Big Sur, but then got an opportunity at a major studio.
Sol had Monte Hellman shoot for a while.
Monte then got another job and I think--
I've forgotten all the directors.
There were four or five directors, including finally Jack Nicholson shot some scenes himself.
And eventually I went in for an hour and shot the final tie-in shots and finished the picture.
It is a somewhat confusing picture.
-( Bird screeching) -( man screaming)
Oh, man, God.
Hopeless, all of it.
( laughs )
I think he wanted to be taken seriously as a filmmaker monster movies and sci-fi movies.
Perhaps it's not so much that he wanted critical acclaim, but he wanted some depth, some feeling, some reason for making a movie.
I wanted to do something a little bit different.
And I'd read the book "The Intruder,"
which was about the integration of the schools in the South.
And I wanted to make that picture.
I was very much in favor of integration.
I showed the screenplay to American International and said, "This will be my next picture."
To my real surprise, they said they didn't want to make it.
And they'd never said no.
I took it to Allied Artists.
They said no.
Everybody said no, so I said, "All right, I'll make it myself."
So my brother and I produced it in the South.
(Gene laughs)
"He was a leader of men, but he was evil.
He was a stranger, but he brought lust and love, rape and hate to this quiet Southern town.
He was the intruder."
This is not the reason we made this film.
It is the exact opposite of what we intended this film to be.
It was not and is not an exploitation film.
This picture was the first film that Roger could actually make a statement about his personal feelings as opposed to doing the Poe films or the films that were just exploitation, drive-in films.
Corman:
Playing the lead was the new young actor making his first film-- Bill Shatner.
All I knew was that it was a wonderful part and it was a wonderful opportunity for me at an early point in my career.
The character I played was based on a real person.
He was a white supremacist from New York City and went down into the South to rabble-rouse and tries to stop the integration of a school.
I mean, they've got 10 niggers enrolled already in the school.
And they're starting Monday.
Yes, I know.
Do you think it's right?
No, I sure don't.
Neither does nobody.
But it's the law.
Whose law?
Shatner:
What is difficult for people to understand now--
"separate but equal" was the law of the land.
That meant water fountains, that meant restaurants, it meant schools that were totally segregated.
It was the height of the integration wars.
It became very apparent once we were down there that people held polar opposite views of what was right and what was wrong.
(crowd cheering )
Man:
Take it easy, nigger.
You're not going anywhere.
- Driver:
What's the trouble?
- Are you looking for trouble?
No, sir.
We're on our way to the house.
"Just on our way to the house."
I didn't tell people what the subject matter is, but the title-- "Intruder," you know.
And with the track record of Roger, all the films,
I mean, they naturally thought it was a horror film or something in that genre.
It was only as everything started to unfold and they saw exactly what was happening-
I mean, people were driving us out of locations.
We had to change motels.
I mean, it got to be very heavy down there.
Hey, are you really gonna make him go to the white school tomorrow?
Why, I'm not making him go.
Am I. Joey?
- No, Ma.
- Well, it's too bad I ain't old enough.
I wouldn't be scared, that's all.
Who's scared?
We were having our lives threatened to make a film about integration.
Roger displayed such courage under fire.
And Gene Corman, his brother- such courage to make the film.
There was such animosity and the experience of hatred that I think we realized we had a bigger problem.
I think we were more naive than we should have been at that point in time.
You were alone with a white girl in the basement of the school, but you didn't try to do anything?
Is that what you expect us to believe, nigger?
- Well, speak LIP!
-( cheering )
Gene:
We felt we should definitely expose our audience to this kind of material, because this is what was going on in America and somebody had to say, "Stop.
This is not the American way."
It was a lie-- everything, everything I said about Joey, all of it.
You were gonna kill this boy.
You know it and I know it.
Shatner:
Making films is a dedication.
You have to be possessed.
At some point there, I realized that they had mortgaged their home for that film.
That, perhaps, was the most admirable thing of all, because it's one thing to be cavalier about spending money that isn't yours, but to be so adamant as to put your house on the line,
that's-- that's extraordinary.
We aren't gonna give up now, not now.
No, sir, not ever.
Gene:
I'd set up the sneak preview with Pacific Theaters.
It was almost a riot in the theater.
People were screaming, "Communist!"
And one of the ushers or one of the people who worked at the theater came up to me, pinned me against the wall, said, "You're a Communist.
You don't belong in this country."
The picture was a wonderful commercial failure.
I started to say "a wonderful critical success,"
but I got confused.
But I'll leave the confusion there because it's all wound up in my mind.
It sort of gets me in the stomach when I talk about it.
Gene:
This is the only film that I don't think we ever made money on.
And yet it was our best film.
We were ahead of the time.
It made me rethink my method of making pictures.
And I felt the public really is the ultimate arbiter of your film.
If there's something you really want to do-- in Roger's case it's making movies- then you keep on doing it.
Every time you fail, you just keep on.
Corman:
I thought, "I should go back to a more commercial type of film."
I was starting to learn method acting technique.
There was what was known as the text and the subtext.
The text is the written script, what you were saying.
The subtext is what you mean, what you really feel, that causes you to say these words.
And I felt
I should make my subject matter the text, which will be a commercial text, but my theme, my message, what is important to me, should be the subtext, so the audience will get what they paid their money to see.
I think he consciously was looking to contemporary events, news, for inspiration for material to make a movie.
Corman:
AIP said, "All right, what do you want to make?"
I said, "There's a phenomenon in the country right now-- the Hells Angels, the outlaw motorcycle gangs.
I want to make a picture about the Hells Angels."
And they agreed instantly.
Peter Bogdanovich:
Roger offered me $125 a week to work as his assistant on the picture.
And he said I could take Polly with me.
His reputation was, you know, complicated, because I kept hearing that he was a millionaire.
And I thought he was pretty eccentric, you know, 'cause he didn't live like a millionaire.
But I had little interest in his movies, to be honest, because I was a big snob and I only liked Fritz Lang and Howard Hawks and John Ford.
The star of the picture was George Chakiris who'd won an Oscar for "Westside Story."
The phone rang in my house here in Los Angeles, in Beverly Hills, and it was Roger.
He said, "We have a problem."
I said, "George can't ride." He said, "How do you know?"
I said, "Because I know George.
He can dance, but he can't ride.
You need a biker." "Do you ride?"
I said, "Oh, yeah, Roger, I ride.
I'll do it."
I said, "Who's gonna play my part?"
He said, "Bruce Dem." I said, "Great.
I know Dernsy."
Bruce Dem:
We just had, like, eight actors, and the rest were all extras.
But the extras made the movie, because they had the machines and they were what the movie was about.
And they were real Hells Angels guys.
They were terrible.
They were frightening.
Dem:
We all rode our bikes down the 2, in the desert.
And he filmed it along the way.
But he didn't get a police escort or anything like that.
He got no permits.
We just did it.
It was the beginning of what you know now as real guerrilla filmmaking.
You know, Roger's a guy who's not gonna miss an opportunity to take advantage of every single thing he can shoot.
At one point, there was supposed to be a kind of a fight between the Hells Angels and the townies.
We didn't have enough townies, so Roger turns to me and he says, "You run in there, be a townie."
So I run in, and within seconds, the Angels were beating the shit out of me.
All I did was go right down to the ground and just prayed for "Cut!"
Dem:
When work was over, you never saw Roger.
He didn't go to dinner.
He didn't-- you didn't know what he did.
As close as we were to him on that picture, and we were literally his only friends-
I mean, not that nobody liked him, but he was just-- didn't reach out toward friendship.
And he remained mysterious.
But tell me, just what is it that you want to do?
( Crowd chattering )
Well, we want to be free.
We want to be free to do what we want to do.
We want to be free to ride.
We want to be free to ride our machines without being hassled by The Man.
-( Crowd agreeing )
- And we want to get loaded.
- Crowd:
Yeah!
- Man:
I second the motion.
Dem:
I remember asking him, oh, about the third or fourth day of the "Wild Angels"-
I said, "How many of these things have you done?"
He said, "This is my 100th."
This is 42 years ago, and this was his 100th movie he directed.
Oh, my God.
The film was really an incredible success.
It was the biggest-grossing independent film ever made at that time.
Bogdanovich: "The Wild Angels" was a tremendous success.
It was a huge hit.
It galvanized the whole underground culture.
Dem:
And that changed his persona and changed the perception of Peter Fonda.
I thought, "This is wonderful.
This is saving me from becoming the next Dean Jones for Disney,"
which is what my agents thought- that I should be that.
Roger felt that I had helped him and contributed something to it.
And he called me and he said,
"Would you like to direct your own picture?"
And I said, "Yes." He said, "All right.
We have a Russian science fiction picture.
And AIP will buy it, but they won't buy it unless I put some women in it.
There's no women in it.
It's all men walking around Venus."
"But what am I supposed to do, Roger?"
He said, "Look at the picture and just decide where to put the women."
"Okay, sure."
"We've got Mamie Van Doren and she'll be one of the women.
Get a couple of other women and just put them in the picture.
And no sound.
Don't write any dialogue.
I don't want to pay for sound."
And I had to explain to Mamie that there would be no dialogue.
She said, "Then what do we do?"
I said, "You look meaningfully atone of the other girls.
And then the other girl will immediately react.
So you look at her and the other girl goes... and goes." ( laughs )
"Telepathy, Mamie- it's telepathy."
We cut this thing together, screened it for Jim Nicholson and he said,
"What the fuck is this about?
What are they doing?
They keep looking and then the other--"
"It's telepathy, Jim."
"It's bullshit." He says, "I don't know what--"
Roger says, "You have to put voices in."
( Moana's voice ) Meriama, Wearie...
Bogdanovich:
"Go get the shells." "Yes."
( Moana's voice ) Ptera is a false god.
Roger is the kind of person who says-
"Do you know how to swim?" "No."
And throws you in the water.
And if you learn to swim because you don't want to drown, you're fine.
And if you drown, that's the end of that.
Doel:
I think he was alert that this was a time when things were beginning to change.
Certainly there weren't movies being made reflecting the changes in the thinking of young people.
And I think that Roger was alert to that.
What was going on really was revolutionary.
I smoked pot at work.
- Doel:
Sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll.
- It was blowing up.
Doel:
Vietnam.
Platt:
I thought it was the end of America.
Dem:
I looked at this guy in a cardigan sweater talking about mayhem in the streets.
I was probably the straightest guy in a fairly wild movement.
Doel:
His political views were becoming increasingly left, as he said at the time, "almost Communist,"
which always makes me laugh, because of course I don't buy that for a minute, but I understand what he means.
( laughs )
For someone who seems so square on the outside, he was actually a very interesting, cool, hip director.
I may have felt at the beginning of the '60s that I was an underdog, but as we got into the '60s,
I thought, "Hey, I'm with the new movement."
Nicholson:
By now Roger and I are in sync.
Hey, the man's supporting my whole life.
How could I not be in sync with him?
He asked me to write "The Wild Angels,"
'cause I was writing by then.
I said, "Roger, you know, we're pals in this.
Can't you just pay me a little more than scale?"
If he'd just said, "All right, scale plus $5,"
I would have relaxed.
No.
And I didn't write it.
To write "The Trip," though, he finally said, "All right."
Cut.
It's good here.
How was it for second camera?
- Man:
Fine here.
- Okay, print it.
Corman:
When I decided to make "The Trip" about LSD,
I felt as a director I cannot make a film about LSD without trying LSD.
Initially the idea was that
I would take notes on Roger's trip.
I think he believed that he would be able to coherently dictate notes to me.
How high are you, man?
Can you tell that?
Listen, I think--
I'm afraid.
There's nothing to be afraid of, man.
I had had a wonderful trip, a spectacular trip.
I felt, to be fair, I had to have some experiences of people who'd had bad trips.
Luckily, Jack Nicholson was a very good writer and he knew LSD.
'Cause I was special talent.
Only he and I had actually taken LSD at the point.
I never did it for fun-- too strong.
I mean, a lot of my friends did, but, baby, I mean, what, you want to confront the face of God literally for fun?
Come on.
I'm Peter Fonda.
We've just finished making a movie dealing with the most talked-about subject of the day-
- LSD.
I honestly believe that it will be today's most talked-about motion picture.
Nicholson:
Roger's a serious moviemaker.
He wanted to make a serious film about LSD, which had just changed the culture forever, really.
That's what the movie is about.
Scorsese:
The artistry of the films really developed.
By the time he did "The Trip," he really had a sense of pushing the power of the image.
What he hit upon in that picture was interesting, particularly if you see it in the full aspect ratio because it just cuts through time and space.
It becomes really a beautiful kind of cinematic montage and achieves a kind of poetry.
AIP were really concerned that this was a pro-drug movie and they would lose money because of that.
( Woman's voice ) It's easy now.
Wait till tomorrow.
( Man's voice )Yeah, well, I'll think about that tomorrow.
Arkoff and Nicholson changed the ending on the picture without telling Roger.
They froze frame and did an optical of broken glass on that.
What is power?
You understand?
He created these guys.
This set me up, because in "Easy Rider," the first thing we do is we buy junk in Mexico, smuggle it across the border, get a lot of money, put it in the tank, off we go.
Corman: "Easy Rider" came out of my films
"The Wild Angels" and "The Trip."
Peter Fonda starred in both pictures and Dennis Hopper costarred in "The Trip."
That whole thing came from Roger to me-- take The Establishment on.
And since they had never made a picture, they wanted me to be the executive producer.
And I said, "Fine." And I took the idea to AIP because "The Wild Angels" and "The Trip"
had been very successful.
And in one unfortunate meeting, one of the executives at AIP said to Dennis,
"if you fall more than one day behind schedule, we want the right to replace you."
I could see that Dennis and Peter were really mad.
Fonda:
And I said, "I can't put that pressure on Hoppy.
That's not fair." And Roger agreed.
Corman:
And I said to this executive,
"He worked perfectly with me on 'The Trip' and I am positive he can do this."
And that was not a good thing to say.
A number of things happened and the picture moved over to Columbia.
And AIP and I lost our percentage of the profits on one of the most successful independent pictures ever made.
Oh.
Oh, what am I gonna do now?
Nicholson:
When I went to Cannes with "Easy Rider"...
Oh, my head.
...my character came on the screen and the movie exploded in that audience.
It just went ka-pow like it does in rock 'n' roll.
I'm the only person who ever in real life felt,
"Holy shit,
I'm a movie star"- do you know what I mean?
--and knew.
So that's what the change felt like.
I experienced it right here.
Roger, if you paid me over minimum, you would have had "Easy Rider."
( kisses )
' ( applause ) -( music playing )
Bogdanovich: "Easy Rider" was the beginning of the new Hollywood.
It's hard to imagine the new Hollywood without Roger Corman.
So many people started with Roger-
Francis Coppola and Bobby De Niro and Jack Nicholson.
And the list goes on and on.
At the end of the '60s Hollywood was so desperate.
They didn't know what to do.
And the young Roger Corman alumni were there to step into the breach.
Dem:
Jack's career took off.
And Peter and Dennis got deals at Universal to make their movies.
Well, those are all offshoots of the University of Corman.
Roger was in a perfect position, having discovered and cultivated Francis Coppola, Bogdanovich, so many other people like that.
I always wondered why Roger couldn't take that next step with those guys.
You had to take that leap.
You had to go from high school to college or you had to go from college to grad school.
It was a jump that Roger never really took.
And that's the one place that Roger left out of his mix.
And that's why he's constantly being insulted by people calling him the King of the Bs, right?
(cheering and applause on TV )
( man speaks on TV )
Dante:
Roger was never taken seriously.
He was a schlockmeister and a guy who did drive-in movies.
He never really got his due, I don't think.
I mean, even "The Intruder," which is one of his best pictures, it was a movie that was hardly ever seen anywhere when it came out.
Dem:
Every year at the Academy Awards, they give out a Lifetime Achievement Award.
How they can not have gotten to Roger Corman by now is disgusting.
And I don't know that they ever will, because they'd say,
"Well, what are the great movies he made?"
(Jack Nicholson on TV ) I guess this proves there are as many nuts in the Academy as anywhere else.
Nicholson:
ls Roger worried about being underappreciated?
If he is, I'm going over there tomorrow night.
(crowd cheering )
Shark!
Shark!
(girls screaming)
Help!
Cut, cut, cut.
Eli Roth:
Roger Corman isn't doing it for the awards.
The fans recognize him.
The filmmakers recognize him.
We know who he is and we appreciate him.
And I don't think he needs some statue from some organization that never liked his movies in the first place to come out and say, "We love you."
Julie:
From my viewpoint, everything is going extremely well.
Observing Roger, however, now as actor/producer...
Kevin, you're aware they're putting a mic on the girl who's not in the shot?
Maybe the kit should be just a couple of inches there so you don't step over it.
No, wait until she comes here.
Stop.
It'll be after they say "Action!" because the camera's on her and it's going to come around and see...
Okay, and we're out of the shot.
He is always noticing what needs to be fixed, what is the problem, but that's the nature of producing.
Okay, so I'm looking here.
And on action, you say, "There's someone here to see you."
Man:
Rolling sound.
Paul W.S. Anderson:
You would think that a man who makes so many films kind of doesn't really care about each individual film, but I think Roger for each of his movies- they're like his children, you know.
And he loves every single one of them.
And he's so engaged in every single one of them.
And, you know, the last time I had lunch with him, you know, he had to hurry away 'cause he was going back to the cutting room of "Minotaur."
And it's like, "You know, Roger..."
They're really- it's just way too much time spent on Iva.
They're working on her makeup all the time.
Explain who she should put it on.
They can't do this stuff for every shot.
Mary Woronov:
I'll never forget Julie.
She was, like, amazing.
She was talking about redecorating her house.
And then she had a child in a crib.
She was raising children, you know.
And here she was- she was known to do movies even cheaper than Roger Corman.
I mean, this woman was amazing.
The first film that I produced, I didn't think of it as producing.
I didn't put a name to it.
I just thought, "Oh, this needs to be organized."
Roger did sit with me for about 45 minutes and go through what's needed- the cast, the crew, and what the positions were and a way in which to shepherd production through.
But then I thought, "Well, he'll be there every day and I could--"
No, he wasn't really available.
And there was this sense I had of,
"He just thinks I can do this?"
And then I just did it.
But he will recognize in someone that he thinks they can do whatever it is.
And then he just walks away and they do it.
Corman:
I first met Julie when she answered an ad for a job as my assistant.
I offered her the job.
She turned down the job, but she agreed to have dinner with me.
We began dating and we also began working together.
Roger had by then asked me to marry him and I had said yes.
And then he went off to the Philippines and I didn't hear from him for a week.
So I was like, "I wonder what that means."
So I called him and said, "Are we still getting married?"
He said, "Oh, yes.
Did you pick a date?"
And I said, "Well, I was thinking of December or maybe later in the spring."
"Oh, definitely December.
Sooner-- better, right?"
I said, "Okay.
I just wonder why you didn't call me."
Well, he didn't call me because it was a long-distance call, so it wouldn't have occurred to him.
But anyway, you know, getting to know each other.
All right now, everybody, reach for the nightgown of the Lord.
-( Crowd exclaims)
- Reach.
Anybody moves-- you're dead.
Julie:
Roger had done "Bloody Mama"
with Shelley Winters and Bobby De Niro.
And, you know, it was a great success for AIP.
And AIP wanted another woman gangster movie.
And so I found this book.
It was the story of a woman who'd been something of a tramp, a hobo, had ridden the boxcars of the rail roads of the United States during the Depression.
It was her story as a rebel, as a pre-feminist, as it were, and as an outlaw.
"Boxcar Bertha" the first picture that Julie worked on with me as co-producer.
It was also the first picture that Marty Scorsese directed.
I met him and he said, "Look, I have a sequel to 'Bloody Mama.'
It's called 'Boxcar Bertha.' Would you be interested in doing it?"
I said, "Absolutely," you know.
And "Bloody Mama" actually had De Niro in it, see?
By the time we got to Camden, Arkansas,
Marty had sketched every shot of the picture, which was all over the walls of his motel room.
I took out all these drawings, about 500.
And he looked at the first 20 or 30 or something.
And then he looked, he said, "Did you do this for the entire picture?"
I said, "Yeah." He said, "All right."
He put it away and he left.
Run, Bertha!
God damn that bitch.
Carradine:
The thing that Roger hated was when Sam Arkoff came in-- 'cause he needed Sam because the budget was too big for him.
And then Sam kind of took over and masterminded the release in a way that Roger didn't like.
And Roger said, "I'm never gonna do this again."
And that's when he formed New World and he went back to making $25,000 movies and worked his way back up again just simply so that nobody could tell him, you know, how he should cut his movie or how he should release it.
Doel:
Roger somehow is fueled by outwitting, I would say, even more than rebelling against, authority.
He was that way with AIP.
I think, actually, it brings out his creativity and his drive.
It just seems to fire him up to just show them that he will do it himself.
He doesn't need them to tell him how to do it or what to do.
I decided to start a small production/dtstrtbution company, a little bit the way AIP had started in the late 1950s.
Roger is a brilliant producer in terms of knowing what the market is, anticipating the trends and then capitalizing on them.
He was a trendsetter for years.
I mean, he-- in the '60s he set every trend.
He has the idea- the original idea for almost all the films that are produced by New World Pictures.
He had a somewhat finite audience.
They weren't expecting things to be held over.
You know, things played for two weeks in the grindhouses and a couple weeks at the drive-in and then a new thing came in.
But within that, you were gonna have a very loyal audience of young people.
Announcer:
Hollywood Boulevard- the street where starlets are made.
On Monday Candy came to Hollywood.
On Tuesday she lost her blouse.
On Thursday she massacred 300 rebel soldiers.
On Friday she found out the bullets were real.
On Saturday she married Godzilla.
By Sunday she was a star.
Things happen fast on Hollywood Boulevard.
Rated R.
♪ Hello, Hollywood. ♪
The fact that the rating system came in was a tremendous change.
Now you were allowed to do things in movies that you hadn't been allowed to do before.
You were allowed to show things.
Announcer:
What they did to her in Jackson County was a crime.
(screams)
Yvette Mimieux.
"Jackson County Jail,"
where the cops make their own laws and the only way out is murder.
(sighs)
We're cop killers.
There are '70s exploitation pictures that are really out there.
I mean, they have plot twists that are like, "Whoa, I didn't see that coming.
I didn't think people did that in the movies."
Announcer:
Woman was made for man to hunt.
Dante:
Roger certainly took amazing advantage of that.
Announcer:
Hunters competing for the game.
Set your sights on the tastiest game, from New World Pictures.
Roger's operation is an exploitation operation on almost every level.
He exploits directors.
He exploits writers.
He exploits people in the crafts who are trying to get established.
But we are also exploiting Roger.
Julie:
I think he had a lot of fun working with these young people.
And so it was often known as, you know, the Corman school of filmmaking.
Demme:
The first time I met Roger, this crazy Roger Corman-y thing happened where he said, "Okay, you can write press releases.
Do you think you could write a screenplay?"
And this had never really occurred to me, but I said, "Yes."
And he said, "Let me explain.
I'm starting a new company.
It's called New World Pictures.
I need a bunch of pictures to go into the works very soon."
He wanted a nurse movie, but he also wanted to crossbreed it with a prison movie.
Announcer:
Four American nurses, snatched from their work in a foreign hospital, jumped in the jungle, caught between a kill-crazed revolutionary and a sex-crazed major.
Roger says, "Exploitation pictures don't need plots.
But they need sensational things like girls shooting Filipinos out of trees.
That works."
In New World-- they very often go back and add action to a picture.
'Cause you'll see how a rough cut plays, and Roger almost always wants you to add another chase or at least another explosion.
♪ Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school ♪
♪ Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school. ♪
Announcer:
"Rock 'N' Roll High School"- the school where the students rule.
Could your school be next?
We knew the genre notes that we had to hit.
And if we hit those notes, what we put in between those notes was entirely up to us.
"Grand Theft Auto"
is a love story with cars.
Also it's a comedy with car crashes.
Announcer:
"Grand Theft Auto,"
directed by and starring Ron Howard.
Well, hell.
We had a very limited number of extras that we were allowed to have at the big demolition derby climactic action scenes.
And I called Roger asking for more extras to fill out the stands, 'cause, I said, "This is supposed to be this huge event.
There's a big riot at the end.
You know, 75 extras is gonna fill exactly, you know, 1/10 of the stands.
It's gonna look cheesy."
And he said no.
And he could see I was dejected.
And he smiled and he put his hand on my shoulder in a kind of fatherly way.
And he said, "Ron, here's what you need to understand.
You do a good job for me on my terms on this movie, and you never have to work for me again."
And, well, I didn't.
I certainly wish that Roger would move out of the formula film-- the exploitation film.
I guess that he just feels that as long as he's investing his own money that he wants it to be surefire.
( "Star-Spangled Banner" playing )
Carradine:
In "Death Race" at the very beginning behind us, there's a city of the future.
And it is so obviously a painting.
It's almost a cartoon.
And I said that to him and he said,
"People come to my pictures looking for camp.
And I'm going to give it to them."
If he just violated this rule of his of never making a movie that cost more than $1 million, you know, and make one for $1.5 million or $2 million--
I said, "Look, all your pictures make money.
None of them go through the top."
And he said, "Yeah, that's true."
And then he went over and turned off the air conditioner.
Sometimes the movies were really dreadful and you had to just sort of camp them up and make fun of them.
- "Cover Girl Models."
- And we did-- by the time we got to "Cover Girl Models," we were doing outrageous ad lines- you know, "They don't need clothes to strike a pose";
"They're always overexposed but they're never underdeveloped"-- to the point where the pictures looked like jokes.
They didn't look like they were real movies.
They're like movies in the front of "Tropic Thunder."
They just didn't look real.
But the audiences never minded.
They were happy.
The limitations of a low-budget film can work positively in terms of getting something spontaneous.
There's no time for rehearsal.
There's no time for extended discussions of motivation and character and so forth.
And indeed there aren't many characters or motivations in any of the films.
You'll never be a star now, you little cunt.
(screaming )
Dante:
The great thing about working for Roger was that every possible obstacle to making a movie was thrown in front of you.
Beverly Hills police.
And if you could figure out a way to get around them, you could make your movie.
At the end credits of "Hollywood Boulevard,"
that background shot was shot while the camera crew was hiding in the bushes and I was talking to the Beverly Hills police and explaining that I was just out here admiring the scenery.
And they said, "Well, get back in your car and drive down the hill."
It's not as bad as John Davis and having to spend the night in jail while making "Fly Me," though.
I think when he called Roger and he said, "I'm in jail,"
I think Roger said, "Well, you know, that's a good experience.
You should learn from this."
Blossom, honey.
You philandering, fornicating bastard, you went off with that skinny honky for two days and gonna come back here and call me honey?
Now wait a minute, Blossom, honey.
I told you I was gonna cut it off if you tried to pull that shit on me.
We called it "make do."
You know, whatever you can do to make do, that's what we did.
And from it, I lived through my stunts.
I look back at it-- would I do them again?
( laughs )Yes, but more padding on the head.
Not a lot of women wanted to do stunts.
All right, everybody, back 'em up.
Grier:
And they couldn't handle guns.
They were afraid of guns.
Sit down on the floor.
Where do you want to be buried, nigger?
And it's Miss Nigger to you.
Grier:
And there weren't a lot of women who wanted to be tossed around the room or thrown over a cliff.
And he said, "Let's keep her doing movies.
She loves to do crazy stuff.
Let's set her on fire."
You know, "How many cars can she crash today?"
They loved that.
He could talk you into, you know, buying some sand in a desert.
Hey, and it'll taste good, too.
I'm like, "Excuse me, did I just buy this glass of sand from Roger?"
Announcer:
"The Final Comedown"-- this year's heaviest motion picture.
Baby, I'm not bitter.
I was bitter 350 years ago.
I'm violent, you hear me, God damn it?
Violent!
Announcer:
Get hip to this year's winner-- the fight you've been dying for.
Rated R, it's a mother.
Dig it.
I did bring "Mean Streets" first to Roger.
And it was the beginning of the Blaxploitation pictures.
And he said, "So the story is interesting and everything.
It's really interesting.
I can give you a couple hundred thousand dollars to do it, but if you could swing a little bit and make it black, it might be-- we might have something here."
So I thought about it.
I said, "Okay, let me think about it."
I wouldn't say no.
I always say yes to these things.
And I walked out and realized my heart sank because I realized, no, they're Italian-Americans.
That's the part of the cultural thing.
It's Sicilians and Neapolitans and ancient code that goes back to the medieval times.
You're a fucking jerk-off.
And I'll tell you something else, Mikey-
I fuck you right where you breathe, 'cause I don't give two shits about you or nobody else.
I said, "That's-- totally not.
I'm not gonna be able to do it."
But because of "Boxcar Bertha"
and because of the group that worked on the film,
I learned how to make the picture within a certain amount of time.
And we were able to take the same principles that we applied to "Boxcar Bertha" and use them for "Mean Streets."
We wound up shooting most of it in Los Angeles because we had that crew and the Corman crew knew how to work.
Dante:
Roger's own personal taste in pictures is very different from the type of pictures that he makes.
And also his taste in directors tends towards Antonioni and Bergman.
Corman:
Most of our films are domestic.
However, we do distribute a number of foreign films--
Bergman, Fellini, Truffaut, now Kurosawa and a number of others.
Dante:
Roger had a lot of connections and he had his own distribution company.
And when the majors started to give up on foreign films,
Roger talked people like Ingmar Bergman and Fellini into--
"I can get your picture on screens that have never run a movie of yours, because I have a different audience and a different way of selling the movie."
And they all signed off on it.
Ingmar Bergman was a seminal influence on Roger as a director.
"Cries and Whispers" did extremely well and Ingmar Bergman was very pleased.
And then Roger being Roger, he had the idea to distribute it in drive-ins.
And that's what he did.
No one else had ever been able to do that before, and probably not since.
That was something new for Roger, to have such prestige people associated with him.
And it just went from there.
Roger, when he formed New World Pictures, was the first company that was completely bifurcated.
In other words, in one direction they were doing exploitation films, but in the other direction they were doing the best foreign-language films that were out there at that time.
Corman:
The money is secondary in that particular area.
It's because I feel these films should get to a larger audience than they do.
Announcer:
The new Fellini--
"Amarcord."
Corman:
The company is building very rapidly, which takes a lot of time.
My wife and I have had three children in three consecutive summers, which takes a certain amount of time.
We would go home in the evening and talk about the problems of the day.
Then there got to be a time when we, like, just didn't talk about what had happened during the day.
But it got to be a little embarrassing because Roger didn't really know what all I was doing and I didn't really know what all he was doing.
And I said, "Look, Roger, it's very embarrassing when people say, 'What movies is Roger making?
' and I don't know.
You know, it is our company, but there's what you're making and what I'm making."
And so he said, "Well, I'll tell you what I'm making."
He said, "I'm making 12 films."
And he couldn't remember the last two.
So he said, "Well, whatever they are, I'm gonna cancel them."
Reporter:
You had made a statement to the press that you were getting out of exploitation films and into higher-budget films.
What brought you back into it?
In my last years as a director,
I was climbing out of the low-budget field and was doing more expensive films, but when I started my own company, which was financed essentially out of my own savings,
I was forced back to low-budget films because those were all I could afford.
New World has had several profitable years and we're now starting to make more expensive films and we're climbing once more.
Roger's had such success with New World Pictures in the past couple of years that now people are dying to invest in his movies.
And if a script is going around town which has his endorsement on it and a promise that he will distribute it, you're in fabulous shape.
There's an old story about the producer with a successful Broadway play.
And his friend comes to him and says,
"Here's the way we can fix the second act."
And the producer says, "Never -- around with a winner."
Roger came bounding up the stairs.
And he said,
"Ron, you're here.
Have you heard the news?"
I said, "No." "Great news:
'G rand Theft Auto'--"
which was a very successful movie for him--
"'Grand Theft Auto' just sold to CBS.
It's the first time we've ever sold a movie to the networks- for $1.1 million."
And I said, "Well, that's great, Roger."
He said, "It's fantastic.
That makes your 7.5% look awfully good."
'Cause I had a little profit participation in "Grand Theft Auto."
I said, "Yeah, it does." He said,
"it makes my 92.5% look goddamn wonderful."

( Theme from "Jaws" playing )
Announcer:
There is a creature alive today.
It lives to kill-- a mindless eating machine.
It is as if God created the devil and gave him jaws.
( Panting )
The blockbuster movie of the summer is "Jaws,"
the tale of a murderous white shark...
The record-breaking box office receipts created by "Jaws"...
- ...the movie "Jaws."
- Some people who have seen it are now seeing phantom sharks every time...
- Steven Spielberg...
- "Time Magazine" seldom...
- When that movie was released...
-( overlapping voices )
Announcer:
See it before you go swimming.
When Steven Spielberg made "Jaws,"
he took a very Cormanesque idea- you know, the killer shark.
I mean, it doesn't get any more Corman than that-- killer shark eating naked girls as they go skinny-dipping.
Roth:
Once people got a taste of movies like "Jaws,"
they really didn't want the drive-in movies anymore.
They stopped going
They wanted to go to the theaters and be part of some cultural phenomenon that everyone was talking about and everyone was going to see.
And it wasn't about taking your girl to the drive-in.
And then everything kind of changed
- on the day "Star Wars" came out.
- Yeah.
We went to an 11:00 show right over at the Chinese and it was extraordinary.
- When these lines appeared...
- Yeah.
...everybody was astounded.
I mean, they couldn't understand.
"Jaws"-- it was like, okay, it's a best-seller and we sort of know that's gonna make a lot of money.
But "Star Wars" came from nowhere.
And all of a sudden this gigantic change happened.
It was just like the "Easy Rider" change.
It was like going to a revival meeting.
That first screening just was amazing.
Corman:
When I saw "Star Wars"
I said, "This is a threat to me because it means that the major studios are beginning to understand what we've been doing for $100,000 or so and they're now doing it for multi-millions of dollars.
And it's going to be very difficult for us to compete."
Corman:
I felt the major studios are hitting straight into what has been my bread and butter for 20 years and also the staple of many of my compatriots.
McCarthy:
"Jaws" and then "Star Wars"
set a whole new standard.
I mean, just the bar got set higher.
You couldn't really get away with doing cheap science fiction films anymore.
Nicholson:
I hated "Star Wars."
If "Star Wars" doesn't make a ton of cabbage, you know, we'd still be having these weird green flashing lines going across the screen.
All these guys are coming from film school.
We're all coming from, "Let us get a job."
( laughs)
He did it first with horror pictures, with science fiction pictures which he did for no money and, you know, quickly and unpretentiously.
That's who we are today.
And I miss the Roger Corman versions.
What we see now is the tent poles of the studios.
The summer and Christmas tent poles are very often films that could have been done by Roger Corman at a much smaller budget.
But those are the films now that are attracting the top filmmakers and the biggest budgets.
And what has the wonderful revolution done for independence of filmmaking?
Well, we make 12 circuses a year and very few movies.
When you read that a picture cost $35 million to make, what do you think of that cost?
Actually I think it's wrong.
I think the artist should be able to express himself for less money than that.
And the businessman should be able to invest his money better.
I think from both an artistic and a commercial standpoint, it is wrong to spend that much money.
And in addition,
I think there are better things to do with the money in our society.
- For example?
- You could- for $30 million or $40 million, which is what some of these films are costing, you could rebuild a portion of the slums of a city,
- just as one example.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
So you think it's obscene to spend that much money.
Yes, I would use that word.
Once the "Star Wars" juggernaut thing happened and the idea that everything had to be an event movie, it just became difficult.
The business changed.
He ended up having to go direct to video with a lot of the stuff.
There's just 100 billion shelves with 100 billion DVDs and it's very hard to stick out.
He switched over to making slasher movies.
And that was a very limited genre, so it was harder to make something that was interesting in that genre.
I met him at a dinner party in New York in the early '30s.
And I said, "Aren't you gonna do any more?
Are you gonna direct a few more?"
He said, "I don't think so.
The whole scene is changing- screwdrivers going into people's heads.
It just doesn't-- it doesn't-- I don't belong there anymore."
George Hickenlooper:
I think he's become more obscure.
And I think that's too bad, because I think he really has a very important legacy in Hollywood.
When a lot of his stuff went straight to DVD,
I think he lost a little bit of his mystique and cachet.
Penelope Spheeris:
If you walked up to any 20, 25-year-old film buff and asked if they knew who Roger was,
I think unfortunately they probably don't.
Gosh, I mean, how many other people have made 400-- 335 movies, you know?
If he hadn't done seven million other pictures, he'd have the same reputation as any of the other artistes.
Snyder:
Are the people with whom you've worked over the years still friendly with you?
Do they like you?
Do they call you on the phone now and again and say,
"Hi, Roger.
How is it going?"
I think so.
I still talk with them.
Careers move in different directions, but most of them are still friends of mine.
They use words with you like, forgive me, "the schlockmeister."
Does that bother you when they say those things?
- Yes.
- Does it?
- Yeah, it bothers me, right.
- It should.
You're just trying...
Roth:
Roger Corman made it okay for all of us to make exploitation movies.
He showed that you shouldn't be embarrassed.
There's nothing wrong with you for loving a movie like "Piranha."
That it doesn't mean that you're stupid for loving a movie that seems like a stupid exploitation movie.
And that a lot of these films are very smart, made with lots of intelligence and that it's okay to have fun at the movies.
I think it's very important to let the generation of today know who he is.
We all-- we knew it almost 40 years ago.
So it's time to reintroduce him as a director, but also what he represents of American entertainment.
He represents a side of Hollywood sort of unto his own, you know.
You know, there are a lot of Samuel Goldwyns, a lot of Irving Thalbergs.
There's really only one Roger Corman.
That style of filmmaking, that attitude, that approach to filmmaking really is unparalleled.
You know, I know it's right to have the tie hand-tied, but frankly the pre-tied ties look better because they're perfect.
I guess the whole idea is if it's slightly imperfect, it's considered to be handmade.
Julie:
Yes.
There's delight in disorder.
Right.
Now...
- There you go.
- Okay.
We're gonna give the Lifetime Achievement Award to Roger Corman.
And they've asked me to be part of it.
I got to call him.
And I said to him,
"The board of governors of the Motion Picture Academy has voted to give you an honorary Oscar for your life achievement."
And there was silence.
He wasn't--
He goes, "Excuse me?
That's unbelievable."
The funny part is, of course, that Roger is, you know, the ultimate fierce independent.
So I told him, "Yes," I said,
"I know when you get up there, you're really gonna stick it to The Man."
( applause )
Howard:
Roger, if you could stand,
I'd like to offer you a toast.
For all your progressive influence in our medium and for our industry, it's our honor to salute you tonight, Roger.
- Hear, hear.
-( cheering and applause)
Tarantino:
The Academy thanks you.
Hollywood thanks you.
Independent filmmaking thanks you.
But most importantly, for all the wild, weird, cool, crazy moments you've put on the drive-in screens, the movie lovers of the planet Earth thank you.
(cheering and applause)
He is one of the finest personages in our field.
Roger, please come up to accept your Oscar.
( Music playing )
Needless to say, I'm delighted to accept this Oscar personally, but I'd also like to accept it on behalf of my wife Julie,
- who's been my-- -( cheering and applause)
--my producing partner for many years.
I think that to succeed in this world you have to take chances.
I believe the finest films being done today are done by the original, innovative filmmakers who have the courage to take a chance and to gamble.
So I say to you.
Keep gambling.
Keep taking chances.
- Thank you.
-( cheering and applause)
When I think of sort of sublime moments in my professional life,
I think of winning an Academy Award, and right next to it is the wrap party for "Grand Theft Auto."
Actually everybody grab for it.
Howard:
I'd always dreamed of making a movie and Roger let me make a movie.
And not only did I make it,
I loved it more than I ever dreamed I might.
Is this sort of like the way you get an honorary degree at Harvard?
Am I an honorary member of the Roger Corman school of filmmaking?
You know, I don't know.
I'm actually a little tongue-tied when I'm with Roger.
I just have- you know, we're completely different kind of people.
And I have such respect for him.
You know, every once in a while
Roger would come to my rescue pretty much, you know, when things were- nothing was happening.
Polly Platt:
My husband left me and the phone stopped ringing, but the only person who called me was Roger.
And he said, "You can direct a picture any time you want.
I'll produce it for you."
So he's the only person who called me.
Demme:
We'll put them on our Facebook pages.
I mean, there's nobody in there that he didn't in the most important way support.
He was, you know, my main connec-- my lifeblood to whatever I thought I was gonna be as a person.
And, you know, I hope he knows that this is not all hot air.
I'm gonna cry now.
Not just me, who's very sentimental, but these other people also love him.
Sorry.
Corman:
Mike, I've just gotten off the phone with Syfy.
They're very worried about the climax of the script.
They believe the Mayan dance sequence in the jungle is not big enough.
I'm going to make the stage bigger and bring in almost a Mayan village rather than a temple.
He wants to stay in the game.
To some extent, he does see making movies as a game, a game that you can win or lose.
And staying in means that you're winning.
Julie:
These are for "Splatter."
- Oh, for "Splatter," okay.
- Yes.
He really epitomized what's wonderful about the American dream- that you can succeed no matter what.
Even if you fail, you can reinvent yourself.
Anderson:
If you love it and you're allowed to keep working, or you have the energy to keep working, as Roger does, there is no retirement age.
No one kind of gives you your gold watch and tells you to go home because your career's over.
Let's go back.
Cut on the frame after she exits the shot-- bam!
right there.
There's an Arab maxim, which is,
"The dogs bark, but the caravan moves on."
And this is Roger to me, as the caravan, you know.
He's making the decision and moving forward.
And you're saying, "But wait a minute, you haven't thought about what the actors will think.
And what about if the truck isn't available?"
"We're gonna shoot this here now."

Hey, quiet.
Quiet, everybody.
Listen.
Quiet.
( Instrumental music playing )
Oh, man!
The ball rolled under the fence!
Go get it, Scott.
No way!
That's quicksand!
If you go, we'll let you play "German soldier girl prisoners"
with us again.
Okay.
- Whoa!
- Scott!
Help me!
Attention, hospital staff.
Reminder:
It's Saturday, which is not all right for fighting.
Repeat, not all right.
Oh, I hate the weekends.
It's so lonely.
I've got a live one here!
I got a thirteen-year-old sinking in quicksand.
I managed to isolate the quicksand around him and then put it in this trough, but there's not much time.
Well, who's going to treat him?
Doctors don't work on the weekend!
He will sink by Monday!
Well...
I'm just gonna have to call the team back together again.
The team?
Get me Cat Black on the phone.
We are all tested.
This better be good, Sy.
It's the weekend.
Quicksand?
I'll be right in.
Eventually, our number comes up.
Quicksand?
Crap!
I'll be right there.
Someday, we all get the call.
Phone for you, Mr. Childrens.
Sy Mittleman from the hospital.
I knew this day would come.
Tell them I'll be right in.
I'm in a Tron-like world right now, Sy.
What's up?
Quicksand?
Be right there.
Give me that.
Sy, this better be good.
It's the Sabbath.
Oh, that is good.
It doesn't matter who you are.
This city needs a hero.
With great power comes great responsi...
Oh.
Got to get that.
Hello?
Oh, hey, Sy.
No, I'm not busy.
Yeah.
See you soon.
It takes all kinds of people:
Butchers, bakers,
- even seashell shellers...
Seashell sellers...
- Seashell seller.
Sea...
Sell sheller.
God.
Oh, hold on.
It's Sy.
Can we reschedule?
- Well, we're in the middle of the...
- Hey, listen!
I am a doctor, and I don't have time to argue with a voice-over coach!
Seashell seller...
Quicksand, our old nemesis.
Just once I'd like to have a kid brought in here in a trough full of quicksand and put one in the win column for "us."
Where's Lola?
I'll be super-pissed if she's in a Tron-like world right now.
Who cares where she is?
She's pretty dumb anyway.
Dori, you go and find her and check every voice-over coach in town.
I hear that's what she's doing nowadays.
Lola's doing voice-overs?
Son of a bitch.
No, Mom, I have to go.
There's an emergency at the hospital, and I can't find my stupid phone.
What's that?
Duh.
Oh, God...
You're the best, Mom, and I'm an idiot.
I'll see you and Phil on Sunday.
Love you.
Who is that chick?
Is that Dori?
Yeah.
Wow, she's gotten really fat, huh?
Especially over the last nine months.
That is a very significant abdominal protrusion.
It's starting to give me a very significant protrusion, and I'm not talking about my abdomen.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
Yes.
What?
You don't know.
It's my wiener.
I know!
Let's go talk to her.
Come on, people!
We're running out of time!
We need ideas!
We could just pull him out.
That'll break all his bones, Doi!
We could send somebody in to get him.
We can work our way up through the basement.
We don't have time for something like that!
Think!
Oh, hey!
We can put kitty litter in there.
It'll neutralize the quicksand.
The couch cushions in my office, they've got kitty litter in them.
- We could use those.
- Great.
Okay.
Wait, does it matter if there's cat poop already in the kitty litter?
- Mm, shouldn't.
- Okay.
- It's like a significant amount, though.
- Shouldn't.
Okay, just...
Where is Lola?
!
This is her specialty, this kind of thing!
Lola...
Where are you?
Oh, I should totally get gas.
Don't want to run out on the way to the hospital.
That would slow things down a little.
Lola?
Greg.
You never returned any of my calls.
My phone was sick.
How are you?
Still tall and... really pretty, I see.
- I got to go.
- Oh, I miss my Lola!
I think about you all the time.
- Did you read my book?
- You wrote a book?
In my head.
Then how could I have read that?
My whole family committed suicide!
Are you drunk?
- I was last night.
- Oh.
- And also now.
- Mm.
I don't know what's going on.
One minute, I was normal sized.
And then boom, nine months later, I was fat.
Do you remember doing anything out of the ordinary, like putting fatty foods in your mouth or vagina?
No.
I can't keep anything down or up.
I have been spending weekends at an opium den having sex with a lot of sailors, though.
Well, that's not nothing.
I mean, opium dens are hotbeds for really toxic materials like rodent droppings, dander, all sorts of DNA...
And the obvious, of course.
- Opium.
- Karate instructors.
Dori, I'm gonna find out what happened to you, and I bet the answer is somehow linked to my boner that won't go away.
The kitty litter in this couch cushion is pretty urine-soaked.
Yeah, well, tell me about it.
It's from my pee couch.
The quicksand is hardening.
It's keeping him from sinking.
Gentlemen, I think we did it.
No.
We didn't.
The hardening quicksand is compressing his organs.
Would have been better off sinking.
Damn it!
Put some water on there, loosen it up...
Stat!
Blake, you find anything in those old quicksand files?
Nothing here...
No story, no sense of continuity, interchangeable characters.
Mostly a lot of bathroom jokes.
Ugh, this water's making me have to pee.
I'll be on my couch.
Come on, Lola!
Where the heck are you?
We need you here.
What are you doing right now?
We need you with us...
to help us do this thing!
So where are you?
Do you want to come back to my apartment and read my journal?
Okay, okay.
Okay, well, I got to go.
Will you tickle my back?
Kyah!
Ugh!
Seashell seller.
Oh, my God!
I totally forgot to get gas!
I figured it out!
You're pregnant.
Pregnant?
Did I stutter?
That explains my mood swings.
And that explains my boner.
How did you know?
Well, you mentioned you had been having sex with strangers in an opium den.
- That could make you pregnant.
- No kidding.
And if I'm right, that would indicate that there will be a newborn baby coming out of your vagina at any moment.
Oh, my God!
I hope my baby's not a karate instructor.
Oh, it didn't say anything about that.
I'm calling it.
Lola!
Smash!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Watch out!
Don't do anything!
Yes!
Yes!
I knew you would know what to do.
But, for reals, where were you, Lola?
Well, let's just say...
I was decapitating my ex-boyfriend Greg.
Oh!
Oh, snap!
You didn't!
Yes, you did!
Same Lola, different day.
Ow!

Next week on "Childrens Hospital"...
I'm not gonna lie to you.
- It doesn't look good for your son.
- Oh, my God.
Ah, I'm just playing with you.
- What?
- I was lying.
So my son is gonna be okay?
No, no.
I was lying about saying I'm not gonna lie to you.
I don't get it.
Is my son gonna be okay or not?
Well, you never know with me, you know?
Attention, hospital staff.
Follow me on Twitter @attentionstaff.
That is all.
Hello!
Chatur Singh 2 Stars Office.
I am speaking from A-One Refrigerator.
Did you order the refrigerator.
Yes, we booked the refirigerator.
Please send it soon,
We're tired of drinking hot water.
-Please tell me your address.
Address?
32/24..
..Police Colony, Dadar West.
Thank you, sir.
It's Yadav's number.
Last time when we booked a mixer you gave Yadav's number.
You paid the EMl and Yadav was enjoying that mixer.
What are you doing?
Pappu!
You forgot it.
Colonel Shakki always said that..
..a great detective should never tell his name and address.
The first law of espionage.
The snack in the right hand shouldn't know..
..that how much sugar has been added..
..to the tea cup in the left hand.
Forget all that, boss.
What are you making me do?
Attacking you over and over again.
I don't like this.
Pappu.
A great detective should..
..be alert..
..24 x 7.
Oh!
-Where are you going?
To open the door, it must be milk man.
Without any protection?
Who are you?
What's your name?
What's your job?
What's your address?
What's your phone number?
Control boss!
Sorry.
Who are you?
I am Dilip Kumar Yadav,
Why did you cme here, Babban?
-Not Babban, sir.
Dilip Kumar..
Yadav.
Who is this Babban, boss?
Every criminal is Babban for me.
What have you brought in this, Babban?
It's milk, sir.
Milk?
What did you mix in the milk?
I didn't mix anything.
What have you mixed?
Water!
-Not water, but poison has been mixed in the milk.
Poison?
Drink!
Drink!
The hunter has become the hunted.
The poison is slowly taking effect.
Pappu, ask him..
How do you feel, Babban?
I am really enjoying, sir.
Had I got some bread, my breakfast would be over here.
Boss, he is enjoying.
Get out!
Brother Chatur!
Shall I bring milk here tomorrow..
..or I should drink it at home?
How do you know my name?
My son told me..
..that brother Chatur is really Chatur(Smart).
Like children.
Will you leave or should I shoot you?
Oh god!
Who are you?
How did you come here?
-Get out.
Get out.
What a genius!
Pappu..
-You know my name?
Boss!
It's you!
I couldn't recognize you, boss.
Pappu, how do I look?
Will you thrash me if I say it?
C'mon..
Tell me how do I look?
-You look like a pimp.
What?
!
You look exactly like a pimp!
Idiot!
I am a pickpocket.
A pickpocket!
Criminals are afraid to commit crime on seeing a cop.
That's why I go outside in different disguises.
So that they commit crimes and I nab them red-handed.
Boss!
You're great!
Why are you falling at my feet?
Please, Pappu!
Boss, your bag.
It has your uniform and your ID.
This means that any unclaimed thing can hold a bomb.
Wow!
I think God heard me today.
Dude, can I have a betel leaf?
I am telling you for the last time..
..I am not a pimp but a pickpocket.
Listen!
I'm a pickpocket!
I'm a pickpocket!
Ok?
Careful with your purse.
Keep it in.
Unclaimed box.
I am sure there is a bomb inside.
Boss, this..
There's a bomb inside this.
Hello.
It's flour.
This is flour.
This is flour, brother.
This is flour.
Move!
Move from here!
You don't need to worry.
This area is secured.
Move!
Move!
What security?
-You have wasted my flour.
I had got it grounded from Goregaon.
My conveyance, the cost of wheat, the cost of grinding.
Give me 500.
Give him his money.
My bag!
That pickpocket stole it!
Nab him!
Just now you were saying that you're a pickpocket.
Now you're blaming others!
I'm not a pickpocket.
I'm a police officer.
-A police officer?
He's fooling us, beat him!
All of you squat properly.
Properly!
Squat!
-Sir, we've caught a new rat.
Make him squat too!
Why squat?
-It's our boss' new style.
C'mon, hurry up and..
Oh!
Who are you?
I know you.Who are you?
Who are you?
Who am I?
I won't tell you.
Your voice is familiar, tell me..
Tell me who are you otherwise I will shoot you.
Tell me who are you?
Shoot me or kill me.
I won't tell.
I know you, tell me who you are?
You know me, and I know you.
You are Dagru from Dagru Chawl.
Your wife calls you by this name.
Oh!
He knows about the private moments of my life.
Forget that..
..1 5 years back you got a red sweater in dowry.
You wear that sweater in summer like Dev Anand.
Oh no!
He knows my sweater too!
Let alone the sweater..
..I even know about the nylon underwear that you're wearing.
Underwear?
How do you know so much about me?
Sir, I'll tell you.
Recognize him, Chatur Singh 2 Star.
Depression, blood pressure, relaxation, tension, laughter.
Which pill should I give you, sir?
These pills are thing of the past, Kulkarni.
Police commissioner RK Sinha doesn't need these pills anymore.
Why would I take these medicines?
Tell me.Why was I taking these pills?
Chatur Singh 2 star, sir.
-Chatur Singh 2 star.
But Chatur Singh 2 star is missing since the past ten days.
And there is no news of his any stupid act.
I think that stupid has realised his stupidity..
..and left for his village.
-Right, sir.
You phone is ringing, answer it.
-Yours is ringing, sir.
My phone is dead.
The landline, sir.
-The landline is ringing.
Hello.
-Inspector Yadav reporting, sir.
Hi Yadav, tell me.What's the matter?
How are everybody at home?
Parents, wife, children and girlfriend?
-Sir, first class.
But I'm in bad shape, sir.
-What happened to your shape?
Chatur Singh, sir.
Chatur Singh!
What did Chatur Singh do?
-What not, sir?
What not?
He has shaken the entire police station, sir.
He has shaken the station?
Hold on for a second, give me the pills.
Which one, sir?
-Laughter.
-Hold it.
Hold it!
Tell me what he did.
He went to the railway station posing as a pickpocket.
Chatur Singh went to the railway station as a pickpocket?
He didn't have any lD or uniform.
-Neither ID nor uniform.
He created panic by calling a box of flour as bomb.
He caused panic by calling a flour box as bomb.
Added to it, he was sitting in my police station for 2 hours.
But he didn't tell his name.
Sir, I am losing my control.
I'll go mad, sir.
You will go mad, but I'm already mad.
I feel like small bombs of anger are bursting..
..in various parts of my body.
-Sir, please control your BP.
I will shoot this Chatur Singh.
Shoot him, sir.
I'll hang him.
-Hang him, sir.
I'll inject poison into him.
Inject poison into him, sir.
Plunge it in!
Take it easy, sir.
Please.
-Hold me.
Hug me.
-Sir!
Let go.What are you doing?
Let go.
Let go!
-Come along.
-Let go!
How did you change your disguise?
I got a pickpocket.
He was stealing someone's bag.
When I caught him, he said a fool gave it to him.
Boss, who can be so foolish?
Show me your face.
You won't be happy to see my face.
Turn around!
You!
You know him, boss?
He looks like a pickpocket.
Do you know what problems that poor..
..man had to face because of you?
Boss, you know that fool too?
-He's not a fool.
I trusted him.
You?
-Not me, that man trusted him.
Shall I arrest him?
-Yes.
-Come along.
C'mon, I'll lock you up.
-Just a moment.
Make him squat!
Make him squat.
Squat?
This is a new torture technique.
Sir, can I tell you something?
No.
You can tell me one thing.
Tell me.
Sir, this squatting is an old technique.
Nowadays there is a latest idea in the market.
Is it?
-Yes, that's what I want to tell you.
Shall I?
Go on.
-Here's your chair.
You sit.
Please sit.
Feel that you're sitting in an airplane.
Cross your legs.
Yes.
Passengers, please wear your seat belts.
Here's the airplane.
Has it taken off?
-No, boss.
It has landed and he has escaped.
I'll go and nab him.
You shouldn't trust these people.
You're right, boss.
Wow!
He's written so well.
What has he written, boss?
Pappu, if only you'd been literate.
And read Col.
Shakki's novel, the flying lady and the sticking snake.
In this, Col. Shakki has discussed kidnapping.
That kidnapping isn't done by one guy but an entire gang.
Oh boss!
What a theory!
Pappu, yes boss.
We'll solve all the kidnapping cases are per Col.
Shakki's guidelines.
Yes, boss.What an idea!
Col. Shakki.
Who has been kidnapped?
-My cat.
Your cat?
Your cat's name?
-I had a cat, a cat called Silky.
Why are you singing it?
-I'm a musician.
How dare you talk to me like this?
Do you know who I am?
Who are you, punk?
-Punk?
!
Old man!
I'm industrialist Nanda's only son, Kabir Nanda.
You are Mr. Nanda's son.
Sir, we have a kidnapping case.
Boss.. boss!
Sir!
We've a kidnapping case.
-Where is it?
There.There.
Notice how I solve this case in 3 minutes.
Sir, he's an industrialist..
Nobody talks till the boss solves the case.
Pin drop silence.
Finger on your lips.
He's the kidnapper.
What do you do?
-l am a musician, I have a band.
He calls his gang, a band.
Who all are there in your gang?
In your band.
-Me, Sandy and a sweet boy Mandy.
He, Sandy and a sweet boy Mandy.
Who was kidnapped and from where?
Silky from Carter Road.
He kidnapped Silky..
Where was Mandy?
He was driving his red hot Ferrari.
Mandy came there with his Ferrari.
He and Mandy put Silky in the Ferrari..
..and escaped.
And where was Sandy?
He was in his godown.
A place in Bhiwandi.
Both of them put Silky in the car..
..and locked them up in Sandy's godown in Bhiwandi.
Arrest him!
-Yes, sir.
No!
No!
Daddy!
-C'mon!
Find both of them.
Arrest him.
Daddy!
Daddy!
-C'mon, you can call your dad later.
I won't spare you!
Arrest him!
You solved the case in 3 minutes, boss.
2 minutes and 40 seconds.
You're great, sir!
Boss, your novel.
The beheaded corpse.
It's the minister's call.
Yes, minister.
Police commissioner RK Sinha saying good morning to you, sir.
Sinha!
-Sir,just a moment.
Before you say something, I'd like to say a little, sir.
If you're going to shower me with praise..
..then there's no need.
If you're going to take pride in me, it's not required either.
Because whatever the police commissioner..
..has done was his duty.
But despite that, if you wish to praise me..
..then please go ahead, sir.
I'll put the phone on speaker.
Shut up, Sinha!
I don't want to listen to your nonsense.
I've not called you up to praise but to abuse you.
Why will you abuse me?
What have I done?
Who is this Chatur Singh?
Chatur Singh?
What has Chatur Singh done, sir?
That fool has arrested tycoon Nanda's son.
Do you know how powerful Nanda is?
Sir, allow me to kill Chatur Singh.
I'll hang him.
And I'll plunge that lethal injection into him.
Give me an injection.
Chatur Singh 2 star reporting, sir.
If your foot lands on mine, I'll shoot you.
I'll hang you and also inject poison into you.
Why have you worn a raincoat?
Sir, it's not a raincoat.
It's a mission coat.
You tell me the mission and don't waste time.
What's the mission?
-Mission, industrialist Nanda, sir.
How dare you to arrest Nanda's son?
To say the truth, sir..
..I didn't have the courage first..
..but with God's grace and your blessings..
..the mission was accomplished.
That's fine but I am not praising you, I am humiliating you,
You should feel bad. -l should feel bad?
Sir, were you humiliating me?
In which language should I explain..
It's 10.30, sir.
-It's 1 0.30, sir.
I think somebody is eavesdropping.
-Here?
In this room.
Stop him!
No!
No!
Stop him!
I'll kill him!
-It's ok.
It's ok.
Nobody is listening to us, sir.
This area is secure.
Chatur Singh 2 star, you're suspended for 1 5 days.
Ok, sir.
Your turn, sir.
Your turn.
We're outside the agricultural minister..
..YY Singh's, residence.
-In the Rs. 500 crore sugarcane scam..
..the HC has rejected his bail plea.
This year's sugarcane produce is in the govt.
Godown.
And nobody knows where the sugarcane juice has been sold.
The minister will be leaving for prison in a short while.
We're anxious about his condition.
Pack everything very carefully.
Don't miss anything.
I have packed everything.
Your clothes, shoes..
..your medicines and your ipod too.
Why are you crying?
I am just going to jail.
Nowadays, all ministers have to go to prison.
But how long will you..
-No buts..
Don't forget my lucky red handkerchief.
I can live without you but can't live without red color.
Sonia, why hasn't the minister come out as yet?
Why is the minister making the cops wait?
Tell us.
No comments.
Minister, the cops and the media are waiting for us.
We should leave.
You're my secretary.
You know my wife very well.
She's slow in everything.
What statement?
-That..
Sir!
Sir!
Call the ambulance!
Hello!
City hospital!
What is it?
Why are you staring?
Haven't you ever seen roasted chicken?
Sir, people outside think that your condition is very serious.
What should I tell the media?
-What difference does it make?
Tell them anything.
Listen to me, brother.
GTthinks that you've AIDS.
Oh god!
I'm ruined!
Devastated!
Shut up!
You are my secretary, handle the media.
Tell them something.
Agricultural minister YY Singh has..
..been admitted to City Hospital.
He doesn't have to fear anybody in the country but..
..minister's like him can pose a threat to the country.
It's the misfortune of the police dept..
..that we have to provide security to such ministers.
I want you to be incharge of the minister's security.
Sir, I am very proud to take this charge.
Very good.
-And equally sad about leaving it.
What?
-Sir, my wife is going to deliver this week.
You didn't tell me that your wife is going to have a child.
Even I came to know yesterday, sir.
-Yesterday?
Ok, Thakur, this is your responsibility.
Yes, sir.
-Good, sir.
But no, sir.
-Why, sir?
I've a piles operation this week.
You didn't tell me that you've piles.
Don't you believe it, sir?
Would you like to see it?
No!
Show it to Yadav.
What?
-Piles!
Ok, sir.
-Ok.
So..
What other excuses do you have?
My sister's wedding, sir.
-Sir, my sister has delivered a baby.
Sir, my sister's child is getting married.
There must be an officer for the security of the minister.
There's one, sir.
-Who?
Non-corrupt, non-intelligent and full of nonsense.
You've suspended him.
-But who is it?

Why did you call me Sinha?
-How dare you call me Sinha?
I didn't say anything, sir.
How dare you call me Sinha?
You're forgetting that you suspended me for 1 5 days.
Today is just the 4th day.
I pity you that's why I called you back on duty.
In that case, Chatur Singh reporting, sir.
If your foot lands on mine then watch it!
Chatur Singh, you've to go on an important job.
Doctors, hawkers and engineers go on a job, sir.
A spy goes on a mission.
How could you say such a thing?
-I mean..
Shut up!
I didn't meant that.
The mission is that agricultural minister YY..
..Singh has been admitted to the hospital.
His life isn't under threat.
Like a good guard, you've to sit outside his room on a chair.
That's all.
You've to guard.
No need to act smart.
Got it?
This mission is fraught with dangers.
But living on the edge is Chatur Singh's hobby and profession.
The job will be done.
-Ok!
Good.. good.
It's 1 2.30, sir.
-It's 1 2.30, sir.
It seems somebody is eavesdropping on us.
Nobody is eavesdropping.
No need to tear down anything.
No need to break anything.
Get out, Chatur Singh.
In that case, Chatur Singh is getting out, sir.
Who's patient YY Singh here?
Who is it?
It's me.
Can't you see?
What you see, doesn't exist.
And what exists, is invisible.
Pappu.
-Great detective, Chatur Singh 2 star at your service.
Ok, fine.
Sit outside.
I've to make enquiries first.
Excuse me.
Who are you?
Well, I'm..

Somebody is hearing us.
Hey!

Fools!
He's my brother.
Godfather?
Which gang?
In my presence, you don't need to worry about any don.
He is my brother!
I know.
It's hot here.Where is the fan switch?
So many switches are here.
Brother is in a fix!
What's happening?
What is he saying?
-It seems he's talking in a code language.
That's unique.
He's asking us to turn off the switch.
Get out!
Get out!
Sir, listen to me.
-You listen to me.
Get out from here!
Get out or I'll shoot you!
Get out!
-But your security..
-To hell with it..

Even if I die, don't come in.
You don't come in.
Don't come in.
Sister, why are you crying?
Did somebody rob the house?
Treadmill, plasma, sofa, painting, everything's there.
The dvd player is there too.

-Brother-in-law?
No, brother-in-law, you can't leave us..
-No!
No!
He didn't die.
He's alive.

Who is this?
-Is it your brother-in-law?
Hello.
-Avery good morning to you, Sonia.
Who are you?

Tony.
-Sonia!

They will kill me.
They're dangerous people.
Brother-in-law, are you fine?

Actually, we wish to play a game with YY Singh.
And you've to help us in it.
Listen carefully, Sonia.
City Hospital,VIP suite..
..where YY Singh has been admitted.
You just have to bring him to the balcony and that's it.
What nonsense is this?
Why will he do it on my behest?
He will do so, Sonia.
Have you ever checked yourself in the mirror?
You look so beautiful.
And if you wear a red sari with this beautiful face..
..then YY Singh will even jump from the balcony willingly.
What if I refuse to do it?
Tony.
-Sonia, save me!
Do what they say or else they'll kill me.
Charlie, I accept all your terms..
..but no harm should befall him.
And yes, he should get protein shakes on time.
And vitamins..
-And vitamins too!
That's like a good girl, Sonia.
And yes Sonia, remember the red sari.
Excuse me.
What's your name?
Sonia.
-Sonia?
Beautiful name.
What's your relationship with YY Singh?
I'm his secretary.Will you frisk me now?
I do wish to but..
..sadly, you can go.
Can I know your name?
Chatur Singh.
-Chatur Singh!
I hope you remember the name.
-Of course.
Now, I'll go?
-When will you return?
If I'm unfortunate, then very soon.
God willingly!
Boss, why didn't you frisk that girl?
Does she look like a criminal?
How can you be so confident about that?
I've seen it in her eyes.
A girl with such innocent eyes can't be a criminal.
You're so great, sir..
-Please, Pappu!
Boss, your baton.
Ouch!
He's not even looking at me.
What are you looking at, sir?
Sir, you know me.
I can give you this cheque and file right here.
Then don't force me to sit next to you.
Sit down, Sonia.
Sir, why are you staring at me?
Am I not looking good?
You're looking so good that I've to turn bad.

Something's fishy!

They must be watching action movie.
Ram Babu.
It's not Ram Babu, it's Rambo.
I know..
I know that.
In connection with agricultural minister YY Singh's murder..
..his personal secretary Sonia Verma was arrested today.
Sonia was present on the scene of crime.
But the reason for the murder isn't clear yet.
YY Singh's murderer Sonia is in Chatur Singh's custody.
This case is very sensitive.
I am afraid that Chatur singh shouldn't make any mistake.
But.. where is Chatur Singh?
Chatur Singh 2 star reporting, sir!
If your foot landed on mine..
I want to discuss an important issue with you.
I also want to discuss an important issue with you.
I was thinking about something.
I was also thinking about something.
I was thinking about someone.
I was also thinking about someone.
But I was thinking about Sonia.
At this age you are thinking about Sonia?
I was not thinking from that angle..
..Sonia's hearing is after 3 days..
..and it's your responsibility to present her in court.
Sir, Sonia is innocent.
-She's not a murderer.
Whether she's guilty or not is the court's decision.
But it's your responsibility to present..
..her in court without any problems.
I will fulfill this responsibilty all my life, sir.
Oh shut up and get out!
Chatur Singh getting out, sir.
Hold him.
Sir, this file..
-Constable!
Tell me who you want to meet?
I want to meet Sonia, I'm her lawyer.
There.
-Thank you.
How are you, Sonia?
Who are you?
My name is Tony and I am not a lawyer.
Charlie sent me here.
What have you got me into?
Had I known that you were going to kill YY Singh..
..then I'd have never agreed to do this.
-Relax, Sonia.
Charlie's happy with your job.
-Shut up!
I did whatever you wanted me to do.
Where's my brother-in-law?
-The job isn't over yet.
Charlie wants you to go to South Africa.
South Africa?
You guys have gone mad.
-Let me finish.
We are not sending you there for a vacation.
Actually, YY Singh has kept the 500 crores from the scam with a South African don..
..Guru Gulfam.
They were partners in crime, you know.
We want you to get those diamonds for us.
Why would I do that?
Because it's better to go to South Africa..
..and start a new life than rot in an Indian jail.
But who would take me out of here?
-Chatur Singh!
He will take you out from here.
And I will take you to South Africa.
Just wait for the right time.
Good luck, Sonia.
Boss!
We've to torture Sonia today..
..and you've tears in your eyes?
It should be fiery, boss.
Fiery!
How will I torture that innocent girl?
You have to, boss.
You have to.
And you've to do your duty.
It was done carefully.
Sonia's coming, boss.
What will I call her?
Sonia.
Ms. Sonia.
Or Sonu?
How do you know my childhood name?
It's the duty of a famous detective.
And it's also the job of a famous detective to hang me.
Pick up your baton and break my limbs.
Beat me up.
Chatur Singh.
Just look into my eyes once.
Do I appear guilty?
Don't show me your eyes, please.
Chatur Singh, please, I'm innocent.
Go away from here.
Or else..
Or else you'll beat me up, kill me?
How can you even think that I'll beat you up?
Please take her away from here. -l will go by myself.
It was only you whom I had faith on.
And you turned out to be like the rest of them.
If possible..
..please forgive me.
Sonia.
What's the job?
-Help Sonia escape from prison.
Go on.
Have you gone mad?
She has been accused of YY Singh's murder.
I will lose my job.
-If you lose your job then come to us, Yadav.
You won't lose your job because..
..you don't have to do this job..
You've to get it done.
By whom?
-Chatur Singh.
This area is secure.
No problem.
Listen.
Not there, listen here.
I've brought an important information.
-What?
That girl Sonia isn't YY Singh's murderer.
What are you saying?
I also had a doubt that she can't be a killer.
Have you read the new novel of the famous thriller novelist?
No, I haven't.When was it published?
Just two days back.
Col. Shakki has clearly written..
..that what is visible, doesn't exist..
..and what exists, isn't apparent.
..and what exists, isn't apparent.
Col. Shakki, you're great!
There's only one way to nab the real killer..
..make the accused escape from prison.
And then follow her.
Yes.
Because he's not going to party..
..after escaping from prison.
But go directly to the real murderer.
But go directly to the real murderer.
Am I wrong?
-Col.
Shakki can never be wrong.
But don't tell this secret to Chatur Singh.
-Why?
Otherwise he will show some miracle..
..and become 3 star from 2 stars.
Is it?
-Yes.
C'mon, let's go home.
C'mon, let's go home.
I can hear any whisper.
I can hear any whisper.
Now nobody can't stop me from becoming 3 star.
Sir, we'll die.We'll lose our job, sir.
Sir, I have a family.
Show some mercy.
Sir, I have two wives and 1 daughter.
I feel ashamed that I'm working in your dept.
I feel ashamed that I'm working in your dept.
We too!
-Shut up!
Boss wants to say that you all have to help Sonia escape.
Pappu, explain the plan to them.
Yes, boss.
Yes, boss.
This is the world map.
And this region is called India.
Boss, I can't find the place in the world map.
Pappu, this mission is between Santa Cruz and Andheri.
Pappu, this mission is between Santa Cruz and Andheri.
Where did the world map come from?
No problem.
Listen.
My mission is that you all will help Sonia escape.
No, sir.
And I will follow her.
No, sir.
I'll follow her to the real murderer.
No!
-I'll box him.
Do karate with him.
Blind him.
Grab him by his neck, lock him up and prove Sonia innocent.
Grab him by his neck, lock him up and prove Sonia innocent.
Who made this plan, sir?
The one and only Chatur Singh 2 star.
No!
And listen further..
Where's everybody?
Boss, after hearing your plan..
..they've all fallen at your feet.
Prepare to make Sonia escape.
Madam, this is your food.
Here, have it.
And listen, get a betel leaf.
And listen, get a betel leaf.
Hello!
Hello!
I can't hear you!
-It seems the signal's weak.
I'll come out and talk to you.
You have your meal.
I can't hear you!
She's coming, sleep off Sakharam.
She's coming, don't look there.
Let's go away from here.
Boss!
Boss!
Something's missing.
Boss!
Boss!
Something's missing.
What?
-What did Col. Shakki say?
To make the girl escape.
-And then follow her.
Oh!
I forgot.
What?
!
What are you saying?
!
Ok.
I received a call from immigration.
Sonia escaped to South Africa by the afternoon flight.
Sir, I know it's my mistake.
Mistake?
It's not a mistake, Chatur Singh.
It's a crime.
Until now, I thought you're a foolish man.
But you're a menace to the country.
You know that an accomplice to a criminal..
..is also a criminal under law.
Sir, give me one more chance.
Chance?
Me?
Look, the law can give you any punishment.
Look, the law can give you any punishment.
But had I been the judge, I'd have had you hanged.
You were very proud of your 2 stars.
Henceforth, you're not Chatur Singh 2 star..
..but Chatur Singh 'No-star'.
Just give me one chance, sir.
Give me once chance!
Don't spoil my mood by crying like this, Chatur Singh.
Don't spoil my mood by crying like this, Chatur Singh.
You've a court hearing today.

Tell me what can I do for you?
Did you find out something about my husband's killer?
Not yet, but I have got this case in my hands.
Now we will find out.

But madam doesn't want to talk to you, Chatur Singh.
Take him away, Kulkarni.
-Sir!
Take him away, Kulkarni.
-Sir!
Let him speak.
What do you want to say?
Ma'am, I know it's all happened because of me.
But give me one chance..
..it's notjust a case for me..
..it's a matter of my 2 stars and my uniform's respect.
But madam doesn't want to give you any chance.
But madam doesn't want to give you any chance.
My heart says that he is a true guy.
But madam..
-Just a moment.
I've made my decision.
I'll talk to the Chief Minister.
And I will take special permission for Chatur Singh.
Please arrange for his visit to South Africa.
Please arrange for his visit to South Africa.
South Africa, Chatur Singh's coming.

Sit on the seat, I'll drop you wherever you want me to.

That's why I read it.

How can that fool pose a threat to us?
He's crazy about you anyway.
Hey!
What are you trying to say?
Hey!
What are you trying to say?
Instead of running away from him, embrace him.
Chatur Singh will help us reach Guru Gulfam and his gang.
But why will he do that?
Because that fool believes that you're innocent.
It's true.
I was trapped.
Because of you, I had to escape from India.
Yes, Sonia but don't forget that you're..
..doing this for your brother-in-law.
I don't know what else I'll be compelled to do.
By using an innocent person..
..I'm ashamed of myself.
Boss, where are you going?
-I'm going shopping.
Shopping?
Have you come here to solve the case or shop?
I'm not going to shop for myself, but for the country.
New mission, new disguise.
Another thing..

I'll knock the door thrice and say, 'Hip hip hurray!
'.
And on hearing that you'll knock the door twice and say..
..'Hurray, hip hip'.
And then open the door.
Get it?
Yes, boss.
Boss, why did you hit me?
Why did you open the door?

After getting the diamonds, my BP is normal.
Sir, have another pill.
I don't need it.
You must need it.
You'll need it after hearing the news I've brought.
I got promoted.
No, sir.
Anymore guesses?
Something to do with Chatur Singh?
-Yes, sir.
What happened to him?
Chatur Singh is not 2 star anymore.
He committed suicide.
-No, sir.
Chatur Singh 2 star is now Chatur Singh 3 stars.
Sir, control!
I can't control it anymore.
I'm not even sneezing.
Boss, what are we doing in this shop?
Fool, new mission.
New disguise.
Chatur Singh 3 stars.
Chatur Singh!
Chatur Singh!
"If the cock lays eggs, I think so.'
"Oh gosh!
Cock laying eggs?"
"If the cock lays eggs, I think so.'
"It's my own wish.
I do what I want to."
"I'm Chatur Singh, 2 star."
"I'm Chatur Singh, 2 star."
"I'm Chatur Singh, 2 star."
"I'm Chatur Singh, Singh..
Singh.."
"I'm Chatur Singh, 2 star."
"I'm Chatur Singh, 2 star."
"I'm Chatur Singh, 2 star."
"I'm Chatur Singh, Singh..
Singh.."
I've checked this area completely.
This area is safe.
No problem.
In my presence, even a bird can't flap its wings here.
Hey!
What's this?
Don't worry.
This is a chicken.
I thought it must be an eagle.
But no, the cock will surely lay eggs.
"Superman is my cronie.'
"He plays kabaddi with me."
"Spiderman told me yesterday.."
"..that Chatur Singh rules here."
"The fool will eat the doughnut.'
"The dumb will sing in his mind."
"The river flows backwards.."
"..
let it flow so, if it does."
Nice statue, man.
"I'm Chatur Singh, 2 star."
Boss!
Boss!
Boss, where are you?
-No..
He saw me and didn't even recognise.
You're great..
-Chatur Singh!
Hello.
Chatur Singh Two Star residence.
I am calling from A1 refrigerator.
Did you book a fridge?
Yes.
I had booked it.
Please deliver it quickly.
We are fed up of drinking warm water.
Give me your address.
Address?
32 24.
Okay.
- Police colony.
Okay.
- Dadar (West).
Thank you, sir.
Boss.
This is Yadav's number.
Last time too when we had booked a mixer..
..you gave Yadav's address.
You paid the EMI.
And Yadav enjoyed the mixer.
What are you doing?
Pappu.
You forgot.
Colonel Shaki always used to say.
A great detective should never reveal his name and address.
The first rule of spying.
The 'Samosa' (Snack) that you are holding in your right hand..
..shouldn't know the amount of sugar in the tea..
..that you are holding in your left hand.
Boss, forget all this.
What are you making me do?
Attacking you repeatedly.
I don't like this.
Pappu.
A famous detective should be alert..
..all the time.
I will just come, boss.
- Where are you going?
Boss, to open the door.
It must be the milkman.
Without protection?
Who are you?
What's your name?
Where is your house?
What's your address?
What's your phone number?
- Control.
Control.
Control, boss.
Sorry.
Sorry.
- Okay.
Who are you?
My name is Dilip Kumar.
Yadav.
Tell me.
Why did you come here, Babban?
Not Babban, sir.
Dilip Kumar.
Yadav.
Who is Babban, boss?
For me every criminal is Babban.
What have you brought in this, Babban?
Milk, sir.
Milk.
Milk?
What have you mixed in the milk?
Nothing, sir.
What have you mixed?
Water.
Water.
Not water but poison has been mixed in the milk.
Poison?
Drink it.
- Drink it.
Drink it.
- Drink it.
I will drink it.
The hunter was hunted.
The poison is slowly showing its effect.
Pappu ask him.
How do you feel, Babban?
Great, sir.
If I had a few slices of bread, my breakfast would have been complete.
Boss, he is enjoying.
Get out.
Mr. Chatur.
Tomorrow should I bring milk here?
Or drink it at home?
How do you know I am Chatur?
Munwa told me.
Mr. Chatur is very clever.
Like a kid.
Will you leave?
Or should I shoot you?
"Chatur Singh."
"Singh.
Singh.
Singh."
Who are you?
How did you come here?
Leave.
Get out.
I am a genius.
Pappu.
You even know my name.
Boss, it's you.
I couldn't recognize you, boss.
Wow!
Pappu, tell me.
How do I look?
You won't beat me if I tell you, will you?
You fool.
Tell me.
How do I look?
Tell me.
You look like a pimp.
What?
Yes, boss.
You look like a pimp.
Idiot.
I am a pickpocket.
A pickpocket.
Thieves, thugs, criminals hesitate to commit crime..
..when they see a policeman.
That's why I don different disguises and venture out.
So that they commit crime.
And I catch them red-handed.
Boss, I am blessed to serve you.
Why are you touching my feet, Pappu?
Please.
Boss, your bag.
Your uniform and ID are inside.
This object could be an explosive.
It means, any unidentified object could be a bomb.
Wow!
I think God heard my prayer today.
Your attention please, platform number five..
..will depart on 11:40.
Will depart from platform number one.
Hey, wrestler.
Will I get the goods?
I am telling you for the last time.
I am not a pimp.
I am a pickpocket.
A pickpocket.
Listen.
I am a pickpocket.
I am a pickpocket.
Okay?
Take care of your purse.
Keep it inside.
Okay.
An unidentified bag.
It must be a bomb.
Hold my bag.
There is a bomb inside.
Hello.
I am leaving.
It's flour.
It's flour.
- It's flour.
It's flour.
It's flour.

Yes.
It's flour.
Leave.
Move.
No need to worry.
This area is safe.
Move.

You dropped all the flour.
I got it ground from Goregaon.
My traveling expense.
Cost of wheat and flour.
Give me Rs.500.
Give me Rs.500.
- Give him his money.
Come on.
Quick.
My bag.
Mister.
- What?
That pickpocket ran away with it.
Catch him.
What were you saying?
You were screaming since a long time.
"I am a pickpocket.
I am a pickpocket."
Now, you are blaming somebody else.
Tell me.
Mister, I am not a pickpocket.
I am a policeman.
Policeman?
He is fooling us.
Beat him.
Beat him.
"Chatur Singh."
"Chatur Singh."
"Chatur Singh."
"Singh.
Singh.

Everybody bend down properly.
Properly.
Bend.
Sir.
I have got hold of a new thug.
Tell him also to bend down.
Why?
It's sir's new style.
Come on.
Come on.
Quickly..
Oh, my.
Who are you?
I know you.
Who are you?
Tell me.
Tell me.
Who are you?
Who am I?
I won't tell you.
Oh, my.
Your voice also sounds familiar.
Look.
Tell me.
Tell me quickly.
Who are you?
Otherwise I will shoot you.
Tell me.
Who are you?
Whether you shoot me or kill me.
I won't tell you.
Look.
Look, I know you.
Tell me.
Who are you?
You know me.
I know you.
You are Dagru from Dagru shanty, aren't you?
Your wife calls you by this name.
Oh, my.
He even knows the private name of my private life.
Forget this.
15 years ago you had got a red sweater in dowry.
You wear it during summer like Dev Anand.
Oh, my.
Oh, my.
He even knows about the sweater.
Forget the sweater.
I even know about the nylon underwear..
..that you have worn under your pants.
Underwear.
How do you know everything about me?
Sir, I will tell you.
"Chatur Singh."
Sir, now recognize him.
Chatur Singh Two Star.
Depression.
Blood pressure.
Relaxation.
Tension.
Laughter.
Which pill should I give you, sir?
These pills are a thing of the past, Kulkarni.
Now, police commissioner R.K Sinha doesn't need these pills.
I had to take these pills because of whom?
No.
Tell me.
Tell me.
Police commissioner Sinha had to..
..take these pills because of whom?
Chatur Singh Two Star, sir.
Chatur Singh Two Star.
But Chatur Singh Two Star is missing for the past ten days.
We have not received news of his new activity.
I think that fool has realized his folly.
And he has returned to his village.
- Right, sir.
Your phone is ringing.
Answer it.
Your phone is ringing.
Mine?
My phone is dead.
Landline, sir.
The landline phone is ringing.
Hel..
Hello.
Inspector Yadav reporting, sir.
Yes, Yadav.
Tell me.
How are you?
How is everyone at home?
Fine?
Your parents, wife, children?
And girlfriend?
Everybody is fine, sir.
But I am not fine, sir.
What happened to you?
Chatur Singh, sir.
Chatur Singh.
What did Chatur Singh do?
What did he not do, sir?
What did he not do?
He has wrecked havoc in the entire police station, sir.
He has wrecked havoc in the entire police station.
Hold on a moment.
Give me my pill.
- Which one?
Laughter.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Now, tell me.
What did Chatur Singh do?
First he went to a railway station, dressed as a pickpocket.
Chatur Singh went to a railway station..
..dressed as a pickpocket.
Then?
He had neither his ID nor his uniform.
Chatur Singh had neither his ID nor his uniform.
He claimed that a flour box contains a bomb..
..and thus he spread terror amongst the people, sir.
He claimed that a flour box contains bomb..
..and thus he spread terror on the platform.
Then?
Then?
Sir, he sat in my police station for two hours.
But he didn't reveal his name, sir.
Sir, I am losing my temper.
I will go crazy, sir.
You will go crazy.
But I have already gone crazy.
- Sir.
I feel as if tiny atom bombs of rage are bursting in my body.
Sir.
Sir, please control.
BP.
I will shoot Chatur Singh.
Shoot him, sir.
I will hang him on the noose.
Hang him on the noose, sir.
I will inject him poison.
Give him, sir.
Give him a poisonous injection.
Take it easy, sir.
Please.
Hold me.
Give me a hug.
- Sir.
Sir.
Now, leave me.
What are you doing?
Leave me.
Leave me.
Smarty, come.
- Sir.
Sir, leave.
Change the getup.
Sir, I have got hold of this pickpocket.
He was stealing somebody's bag.
When I caught him, he said a fool has given it to him.
Boss, who will be so foolish?
Show me your face.
You won't be pleased to see my face, sir.
Turn around.
You!
Boss, you know him?
I mean, he looks like a pickpocket.
Do you know?
That innocent man had to face a lot of problems because of you.
Boss, you even know that fool?
He is not a fool.
I trusted him.
Me?
- I..
That man trusted him.
Shall I put him behind bars?
- Yes.
Come.
Come.
- One moment.
I will put you behind bars.
Come.
- One moment.
One moment.
'Tell him also to bend.'
Tell him to bend.
Bend?
- Bend?
It's third degree's new technique.
Sir, shall I say something that I am not in the position to say?
No.
Say something that's beneath you.
Tell me.
Sir, it's quite an old idea.
Nowadays a latest idea has come in the market.
Is that so?
- Yes.
You should use it.
Shall I show you?
- Yes.
It's here.
It's here.
The chair is here, sir.
Sit.
Sit.
Assume that you are sitting in an airplane.
Fold your legs.
Passengers, tie your seatbelt.
Tie your hands.
Hands.
Hands.
Yes.
Here is the airplane.
Has the plane taken off?
No, boss.
It has landed.
He ran away.
I will go and catch him.
You shouldn't trust such men.
You are right, boss.
Wow!
What a story!
What is the story, boss?
Pappu, I wish you were educated.
And you had read Colonel Shaki's novel..
..'Udti Mem Chipakta Saap'.
In this novel, Colonel Shaki has discussed kidnapping.
Kidnapping is committed not by a lone man but by an entire gang.
Boss, what a theory!
Pappu.
- Yes, boss.
In the future we will solve all kidnapping cases..
..with the aid of Colonel Shaki's novel.
Yes, boss.
What an idea!
Colonel Shaki.
Who has been kidnapped?
My cat.
My cat.
Cat?
Cat's name?
I had a cat.
A cat called Silky.
Why are you singing?
I am a musician.
How are you talking to me!
Do you know who I am?
Who are you?
- What?
Old man.
I am the only son of industrialist Nanda.
Kabir Nanda.
You are Mr. Nanda's son?
Sir.
Sir.
Sir, there is a kidnapping case.
Boss.
Boss.
Boss.
Boss.
Boss, there is a kidnapping case.
Where?
Where?
Boss, here.
Here.
Just see.
I will solve this case in three minutes.
Sir, he is famous industrialist..
Until boss doesn't solve the case, nobody will speak.
Pin drop silence.
Finger on your lips.
He is the kidnapper.
What do you do?
I am a musician.
I have a band.
He calls his gang 'band'.
Who is in your gang?
In your band?
Me.
Sandy.
And a sweet boy Mandy.

He was driving his red hot Ferrari.
Mandy came there in a Ferrari.
Mandy and he put Silky in the Ferrari.
And they drove away in the Ferrari.
Where was Sandy?
He was in his warehouse, a place in Bhiwandi.
Both of them put Silky in the car.
And locked him in Sandy's warehouse in Bhiwandi.
Arrest him.
- Yes, sir.
No.

Daddy.
Daddy.
- Find both of them.
I say arrest him.
Daddy.

Daddy later.

I won't spare you.
Arrest him.
You solved the case within three minutes, boss.
Two minutes 40 seconds.
I am blessed to serve you.
Boss, your novel 'Sar Kati Laash'.
The minister is calling.
My nose, sir.
Yes, minister sir.
Police commissioner R.K. Sinha..
..saying good morning to you, sir.
Sinha..
- Just a minute, sir.
Just a minute, sir.
I want to say something before you say anything, sir.
Sir, there is no need if you want to sing my praises.
Sir, if you want to be proud of me.
That is not needed either.
Because whatever police commissioner did was his duty.
In spite of this, if you still want to praise me..
..do it wholeheartedly.
Hold on a minute.
Let me put it on speaker phone.
Shut up, Sinha.
I don't want to hear your nonsense.
I have called up not to praise you but to take you apart.
Why would you take me apart?
What have I done?
Who is this creature named Chatur Singh?
Chatur Singh.
What has Chatur Singh done, sir?
That fool has put famous businessman..
..Nanda's son behind bars.
Do you know how big a man Nanda is?
Sir, give me permission.
I'll shoot Chatur Singh.
And I will hang him.
And I'll give him a poisonous injection up his..
Sir.
Sir, please.
You give me an injection.
Chatur Singh two star reporting, sir.
If you step on my leg, I will shoot you.
And I will hang him.
And I'll give you a poisonous injection.
And why are you wearing this raincoat?
Sir, this isn't a raincoat.
It is the mission's coat.
Tell me what the mission is.
Don't waste time.
What is the mission?
Mission industrialist Nanda, sir.
Mission.
How dare you arrest industrialist Nanda's son?
To be honest, sir.
I didn't have the courage at first.
But with God's grace and your blessings..
..the mission was completed.
That's fine.
But I'm not praising you.
I'm humiliating you.
You must feel bad.
I must feel bad.
Sir, where are you humiliating me?
God, in what language should I explain to him?
It is 10.30, sir.
It is 10.30, sir.
I guess someone's hearing us.
- Here?
Here.
In this room.
"Singh.
Singh."
"Singh.
Singh."
Stop him.
Stop him.
I'll kill him.
- It's okay.
It's okay.
No one's hearing us, sir.
This area is safe.
Chatur Singh Two Star, you're suspended for 15 days.
Okay, sir.
Mr. Kulkarni.
Your turn.
Your turn.
Yes.
Stay with us on our channel.
And..
All of us are outside Agriculture minister..
..Y.Y. Singh's house.
High court has cancelled his bail application..
..in the 50 million sugarcane scam.
This year's sugarcane yield is in the government warehouse.
But no one has any clue where the sugarcane juice has been sold.
There is just a little time before the minister goes to jail.
I wonder what would be his condition.
You fool, pack all the things properly.
Don't miss anything.
I am packing everything.
Your clothes, your shoes.
Your Chyawanprash.
And your ipod too.
So why are you crying?
I am going to a jail.
These days all the ministers have to go to jail.
But for how long..
No ifs and buts..
Don't forget my lucky red hanky.
I can live without you.
But never without red colour.
"The hottest girl around."
"The hottest girl around."
"Oh my.
Oh my.
Oh my.."
Ms. Soniya, why hasn't the minister come out yet?
Ms. Soniya, tell us why is the minister..
..making the police wait for so long?
No comments.
Sir, the media and police are waiting for us outside.
We must go.
You're my secretary.
You know my wife so well.
She is slow in every regard.
The leader has come.
Stop!
Hey!
Back up!
The PR statement..
Sir, what happened to you?
Sir!
- Sir!
What happened?
- Sir!
What happened?
Call the ambulance.
Hello.
City hospital.
What?
Why are you staring your eyes out?
Haven't you ever seen 'Tandoori' chicken before?
Sir, people outside feel that your condition is very serious.
What disease do I tell the media?
That is no big deal.
Say anything.
Brother, listen to me today.
T.T's whistle says that you have AIDS.
I am doomed.
Shut up, you fool.
Soniya, you're the secretary.
Handle the media.
Tell them something.
Say something.
Agriculture minister Y.Y. Singh is admitted to the City hospital.
He has no threat from anyone in the country.
But he could pose grave threat to the country.
It's the misfortune of the police..
..that we have to provide security to ministers like him.
Yadav, I want the job of the minister's security be given to you.
Sir, I am feeling really proud taking this charge.
Very good.
And I am as sorry while leaving it.
What do you mean?
Sir, my wife is supposed to deliver this week.
You didn't tell me your wife is expectant.
I came to know just yesterday, sir.
You found out just yesterday..
Okay.
Bakur, this is your responsibility.
Yes sir.
- Good, sir.
But no, sir.
- Why, sir?
I have my piles operation this week, sir.
You didn't tell me you have piles.
You don't believe me, sir.
Would you like to see?
- No.
Show it to Yadav.
- What, sir?
Piles.
- Okay, sir.
So what excuses others have?
Tell me.
Tell me.
My sister is getting married, sir.
Sir, my sister has had a baby.
Sir, my sister's child is getting married.
But there must be some officer..
..who can take up the minister's security.
Sir, there is.
- Who?
Non corrupt.
Non intelligent.
And full of nonsense.
Whom you have suspended?
Who the hell is this?
Chatur Singh Two Star.
"Wow!"
"Wow!"
"Singh.
Singh.
Singh."
"Chatur Singh coming."
"Swing that thing."
"Drum beats drumming.
"Here comes the king."
Sitar strings humming."
"Now you're going to meet the smart, crazy kind of guy so.."
"Wham bamm bam.
Daddy of the clever."
"Slam damm damm..
I may shine forever."
"Pump up the jam and you will never say never."
"So I sing, you sing, we all sing Chatur Singh."
"Sing, sing do in the same thing."
"He is the king with the zing thing."
"Not a puppet on a swing thing."
"You better beware.
Anyone dares to lock horns with him."
"Don't even dare.
He won't spare you.."
"You beware.
It'll only mean trouble for you."
"So I sing, you sing, we all sing Chatur Singh."
"Sing, sing do in the same thing."
"He's the king with the zing thing."
"Not a puppet on a swing thing."
"Wow!"
"Lets do the Chatur Singh thing now."
"We are going to do the Chatur Singh thing now."
"We are going to do the Chatur Singh thing now."
"We are going to do the Chatur Singh thing now."
"If you're looking for your long lost brother."
"If you're worried that your beloved is unfaithful."
"Call him home.
Don't worry about money."
"Because he is a cute, loveable, simple kind of a guy."
"High, high, high.. in no hurry."
"So why, why, why.. are you so sorry?"
"Bye, bye, bye.. you never have to worry."
"So I sing, you sing, we all sing Chatur Singh."
"Sing, sing do in the same thing."
"He is the king with the zing thing."
"Not a puppet on a swing thing."
"Say, who India's son is."
"Hey the king the don."
"The one icon.
He is the heart stealer."
"So I sing, you sing, we all sing Chatur Singh."
"Sing, sing do in the same thing."
"He is the king with the zing thing."
"Not a puppet on a swing thing."
"Are you all ready for these?"
"Where's the case?
What is he involved in?"
"Leader of the race.
A master in everything."
"Don't be afraid.
Whether is a murderer or killer."
"Where's the case?
What is he involved in?"
"Leader of the race.
A master in everything."
"Don't be afraid.
Whether is a murderer or killer."
"So I sing, you sing, we all sing Chatur Singh."
"Sing, sing do in the same thing."
"He is the king with the zing thing."
"Not a puppet on a swing thing."
"Sing, sing do in the same thing."
"He is the king with the zing thing."
"Not a puppet on a swing thing."
Yes, Sinha.
Why did you call me?
How dare you call me Sinha?
I didn't say anything, sir.
How dare you call me Sinha?
I guess you're forgetting that you had suspended me for 15 days.
Today is the just the fourth day.
I felt sorry for you.
So I reinstated you.
In that case, Chatur Singh reporting, sir.
If you step on my leg, then let me tell you..
Chatur Singh, you have to go for an important work.
Doctors, paanwalas and engineers go to work, sir.
A detective goes on a mission.
How can you say that?
- I mean?
I mean?
- How can you..?
Keep quiet.
I didn't mean that.
This is the mission.
Agricultural minister Y.Y. Singh has been hospitalized.
His life is in no threat from anyone.
You have to sit outside his room on a nice chair..
..like a good guard.
You just have to guard.
Don't try to act smart.
Okay?
This mission is fraught with danger.
But it's Chatur Singh's hobby and profession to play with danger.
Job will be done, sir.
- Okay.
Good.
Good.
It is 12.30, sir.
It is 12.30, sir.
- It is 12.30.
I guess someone's hearing us.
No one's hearing us.
You don't need to tear or break anything.
Get out, Chatur Singh.
In that case, Chatur Singh getting out, sir.
"I'm Chatur Singh.
Two Star."
"I'm Chatur Singh.
Two Star."
"I'm Chatur Singh.
Two Star."
Who is patient Y.Y. Singh here?
What do you mean who?
Me.
Can't you see?
What you see isn't there?
And you can't see what is there.
Pappu.
Great detective Chatur Singh Two Star.
Your safety is his responsibility.
Okay.
Okay.
Sit outside.
Come on.
Let me investigate before that.
Excuse me.
Who are you?
Well, I..
Mr. Detective, she is my wife.
What is in your hands?
This.
This is orange juice.
Pappu, send this to the forensic lab.
For testing.
- Yes boss.
Someone's hearing us.
"Singh.
Singh."
"Singh.
Singh."
Oh God!
What?
What?
As I had said.
Someone is overhearing us.
Idiot.
He's my Bhai (don).
Which company's Don?
Don't be afraid of any don as long as Chatur Singh is here.
He is my brother.
I know.
It is so hot.
Where is the switch of the fan?
Boss, there are lots of switches here.
My brother is doomed.
What's happening?
What is he saying?
I guess he is talking in code.
That's unique.
I think..
He is asking to switch it off.
Who is this crazy man?
Throw him out.
Throw him out.
Sir, listen to me.
No.
You listen to me.
Get out.
Out.
Or I'll shoot you.
Out.
But your security is our..
To hell with my security.
Get lost.
Out.
Don't come inside even if firing takes place here.
Don't come inside even if I die.
Don't come inside.
- He ran away.
Don't come inside.
Sister, why are you crying?
Has there been a robbery in the house?
But treadmill, plasma, sofa, painting.
Everything is there.
The DVD player is also there.
- Then?
Your brother-in-law.
Brother-in-law!
No, brother-in-law.
You can't leave us.
- No.
No.
He isn't dead.
He is alive.
He has been stolen.
Yes.
From the gym.
He was coming out after working out.
Two goons abducted him.
Who is this?
Is it your brother-in-law?
Hello.
A very good morning to you, Soniya.
Who is this?
- Charlie.
You are really worried about brother-in-law, right?
I won't spare you if anything happens to my brother-in-law.
Tony.
Soniya, save me.
These people will kill me.
They are very dangerous people.
Brother-in-law, are you okay?
Hello.
Are you alive?
- Yes.
But without the protein shake.
They haven't offered me a glass of 'Lassi' (sweet butter milk)..
..since six hours.
What!
Brother-in-law, you know me, don't you?
Don't worry at all.
I'm there.
I'll fix everything.
Give the phone to Chaplin.
Mr. Chaplin, please talk.
Yes Chaplin?
- Charlie.
Whatever.
What do you want?
Y.Y. Singh.
- Y.Y. Singh?
Yes, Soniya.
Don't refuse.
Please.
Or we'll also be sorry about your brother-in-law's death.
Actually, I want to play a small game with Y.Y. Singh.
And you'll have to help us in this.
Listen carefully, Soniya.
City hospital.
VIP suite.
Where Y.Y. Singh has been admitted.
You just have to bring him to the balcony.
That's it.
Simple.
What nonsense is this?
Why would he do that if I ask him to?
He will for sure, Soniya.
Soniya, have you ever looked at yourself in the mirror?
You look so beautiful.
Soniya, and if you wear a red sari to go with your..
..beautiful face, Y.Y. Singh will even jump off the balcony.
And what if I refuse from doing all this?
Tony.
- Soniya, save me.
Do as they say or they'll kill me.
Look Charlie, I accept all your terms.
But nothing should happen to my brother-in-law.
And he must get protein shake from time to time.
And vitamins too.
- And vitamins too.
That's like a good girl, Soniya.
And yes, Soniya.
Remember.
Red sari.
"Yo.
I am the hottest girl around."
"Come on."
"I am the hottest girl around."
Who are you?
Excuse me.
What's your name?
Soniya.
Soniya.
Beautiful name.
What's your relationship with Y.Y. Singh?
I am his secretary.
Will you even frisk me?
"Yeah."
I feel like doing that.
But you are clean.
You can go.
Can I ask your name?
Chatur Singh.
Chatur Singh.
You will remember my name, won't you?
Of course.
Now, I will go?
When will we meet again?
If my luck is bad, very soon.
God willing.
Boss, why didn't you frisk that girl?
Does she look like a criminal, Pappu?
How can you say that for sure?
I have seen in her eyes.
A girl with such innocent eyes..
..can't be a criminal.
I am blessed to serve you.
Pappu, please.
Please, Pappu.
Boss, your stick.
Ouch.
'He is not looking at me.'
What are you looking at, sir?
"Baby, I can take it no more."
"Oh, yeah."
"I can't take it."
"Take it."
"Take it no more."
Sir, you know me, don't you?
I can give you the cheque and the file while standing.
So please.
Don't force me to sit besides you.
Sit, Soniya.
Sir, why are you staring at me?
Am I not looking nice?
You are looking so nice that I will have to become bad.
"Oh, yeah."
"No one.
No one."
"Pearl bangles and pearl necklace."
"Pearl bangles and pearl necklace."
"My youth is yours."
"Pearl bangles and pearl necklace."
"My youth is a bazaar."
"Why are you thinking so much?"
Boss, control.
"Why are you thinking so much?"
"I am a jungle doe."
"Hunt me."
"This close."
"No one.
No one."
"There is merriment as well as chance."
"Embrace me."
"Youth is not going to wait."
"There is merriment as well as chance."
"Embrace me."
"Youth is not going to wait."
"My youth is so charming."
"Anyone who touches me gets a jolt."
"It's a virgin body."
"Put your mark on it."
What are you doing, boss?
Is somebody watching?
- No one is here.
"Don't keep any debts, beloved."
"Don't keep any debts, beloved."
"Why are you thinking so much?"
"I am a jungle doe."
"Hunt me."
"What price will you give if I make you forget everything?"
"Oh, yeah."
"I will show you the world in a moment."
"What price will you give if I make you forget everything?"
"I will show you the world in a moment."
"I will sway my thin waist."
"I will make you fall at my feet."
"Make me your beloved."
"Or spend your nights alone."
"Or spend your nights alone."
"Why?
Why?
Why?"
"Why are you thinking so much?"
"I am a jungle doe."
"Hunt me."
Boss, there was firing inside.
Don't worry, Pappu.
They must be watching an action movie.
'Ram Babu'.
Not 'Ram Babu'.
It's Rambo.
I know.
I know that.
Agriculture minister Y.Y. Singh's personal secretary..
..Soniya Verma has been arrested today for murdering him.
Soniya was present at the crime scene.
But the motive of murder is still not clear.
Y.Y. Singh's murderer Soniya is in Chatur Singh's custody.
It's a very delicate case.
I am afraid Chatur Singh might again do something foolish.
But where is Chatur Singh?
Chatur Singh Two Star reporting, sir.
What if you had stepped on my foot?
I want to talk to you urgently.
I also want to talk to you urgently.
I was thinking of something.
I was also thinking of something.
I was thinking about someone.
I was also thinking about someone.
I was thinking about Soniya.
What?
You are thinking about Soniya at this age, sir.
Shut up.
I wasn't thinking from that angle.
Soniya will be presented in the court after three days.
And it's your responsibility to take her there.
Sir, Soniya is innocent.
She is not the killer.
The court will decide whether she is guilty or innocent.
But it's your responsibility to take her..
..to the court without being careless.
I will fulfill this responsibility all my life, sir.
Shut up.
And get out from here.
Chatur Singh getting out, sir.
Mr. Kulkarni.
Sir, this file..
- Constable.
Yes.
Tell me.
Whom do you want to meet?
Ms. Soniya.
I am her lawyer.
Go in.
- Thank you.
How are you, Soniya?
Who are you?
My name is Tony.
I am not a lawyer.
Charlie has sent me.
Where have you people got me stuck!
Had I known that all of you are going to kill Y.Y. Singh..
..I would have never agreed to do this work.
Relax, Soniya.
Charlie is very happy with your work.
Just shut up.
I did whatever all of you wanted.
Where is my brother-in-law?
The work is still not over.
Charlie wants you to go to South Africa.
South Africa.
All of you have got crazy.
Let me finish.
We aren't sending you there for a vacation.
Actually, 500 crores that Y.Y. Singh got from the sugarcane scam..
..he gave it to some don in South Africa called Gullu Gulfam.
They were partners in crime, you know.
We want you to get hold of the diamonds for us.
Why will I do that?
Because instead of rotting in an Indian prison all your life..
..it is better that you go to South Africa.
And begin a new life.
Who will get me out of here?
Chatur Singh.
He will get you out of here.
I will take you to South Africa.
Just wait for the opportunity.
Good luck, Soniya.
Boss.
Today, you have to give third degree to Soniya.
And you are crying.
You should be charged up, boss.
Charged up.
How do I give third degree to that innocent girl?
You will have to do it, boss.
You will have to do it.
You are a police officer.
And you will have to fulfill your duty.
Whatever work you do, do it carefully.
Soniya is coming, boss.
What will I say to her?
Soniya.
Ms. Soniya.
You are Sonu.
How do you know my childhood name?
It is the job of a famous detective.
And it's also the job of a famous detective..
..to give me third degree.
Pick up your stick.
Break my hands and feet.
Beat me.
Mr. Chatur Singh.
Look into my eyes once.
Do I look like a criminal?
Don't show me your eyes.
Please.
Mr. Chatur Singh, please.
I am innocent.
Leave.
Otherwise..
Otherwise what?
You will give me third degree?
You will beat me?
How can you think that I will beat you?
Constable, take her.
Please.
Fine.
I will go on my own.
But.
You were the only one whom I trusted.
You also turned out to be like the rest.
If possible..
"Chatur Singh."
..forgive me.
"Chatur Singh, two star."
Sonu. - "Chatur Singh."
What work do you have?
Helping Soniya escape from prison.
Come on.
Come on.
Are you crazy?
She has been accused of murdering Y.Y. Singh.
I will lose my job.
If you lose your job, come to us, Mr. Yadav.
You won't lose your job.
Because you don't have to do this job.
You have to make somebody else do it.
Who?
Chatur Singh.
'This area is safe.'
'No problem.'
Listen.
Not there.
Here.
Listen.
I have some important information.
What?
Soniya didn't murder Y.Y. Singh.
What are you saying?
I also felt so.
That she can't be the killer.
Have you read famous spy writer Colonel Shaki's new novel?
'Asli Katil Kaun'?
I didn't read it.
When was it published?
Two days ago.
Colonel Shaki has clearly written.
Things are not what they appear to be.
And truth is not always seen.
Colonel Shaki.
You are great.
There is only one way to nab the real killer.
Help the imprisoned criminal flee from prison.
And then follow him.
Yes.
Because after fleeing from prison..
..he won't take rides in Essel World.
He will directly go to the real killer.
Am I wrong?
Colonel Shaki can't be wrong.
But don't tell Chatur Singh.
- Why?
Otherwise he will show some feat and from two star..
..he will become three star Chatur Singh.
Is that so?
- Yes.
Let's go home.
Chatur Singh hears even the minutest sound.
Now, nobody can stop me from getting three star.
Sir, we will die.
We will lose our job, sir.
Sir, I have a wife and two children.
Have mercy on me, sir.
Sir, I have two wives and a child.
I feel ashamed of working in your department.
Same here.
- Shut up.
Boss wants to say that all of you will..
..have to help Soniya flee from here.
Pappu.
Explain the plan to them.
Yes, boss.
This is the world map.
This area is called India.
Boss, I can't find ***** in the world map.
Pappu.
This mission is from Santacruz to Andheri.
How did the world map come into the picture?
No problem.
So listen.
- Sir.
My mission is that all of you will help Soniya flee.
No.
I will follow her.
No.
- By following her, I will reach to the real killer.
No.
I will have a boxing match with him.
And karate.
I will gouge out his eyes.
I will strangulate him, put him behind bars..
..and prove that Soniya is innocent.
Who made this plan, sir?
The one and only Chatur Singh Two Star.
No.
"Chatur Singh Two Star."
- Listen further.
Where did everybody go?
Boss, after hearing your plan everybody fell at your feet.
"Chatur Singh Two Star."
Make preparations.. to help Soniya flee.
Ma'am, your food.
Give her food.
Have it.
Listen.
Bring a Banarasi betel leaf for me.
Hello.
Hello.
I can't hear.
I think it's disconnecting.
I will do one thing.
I will come out and talk.
Okay?
One moment.
Have your dinner.
Yes.
Hello.
I can't hear. - "Chatur Singh.
Two star."
"Chatur Singh."
She is coming.
Go to sleep, Sakharam.
"Chatur Singh."
"Two star."
"Chatur Singh."
"Chatur Singh."
"Two star.
Chatur Singh."
She is coming.
Don't look there.
- Okay.
Let's leave.
Come on.
Boss.
Boss.
Boss, something is missing.
What?
What did Colonel Shaki say?
To help the girl flee.
After that you have to follow her too.
I forgot.
What?
What are you saying?
Okay.
I got a call from the immigration.
Soniya left for South Africa by the afternoon flight.
Sir, I know it's my fault.
Fault?
It's not a mistake, Chatur Singh.
It's a crime.
Until now I used to think that you are a foolish person.
But you are a threat to our country.
In the eyes of law, the one who helps a criminal is also a criminal.
You know this, don't you?
- Sir.
Give me one more chance.
Please, sir.
Chance.
And me.
Look, law can give you whatever punishment it wants.
But if I had been the judge, I would have given you death penalty.
You were very proud of your two star.
Henceforth you will be Chatur Singh with no star..
..and not Chatur Singh Two Star.
Sir, please.
Give me one chance.
Give me one chance.
Give me one chance.
Chatur Singh, don't spoil my mood by begging like that.
Your hearing is to be held today.
And I'm very happy about that.
Sir, please understand.
Understand what, Chatur Singh?
What's going on?
Hello.
So sad to hear about the minister's demise.
But congratulations on replacing him.
Tell me.
What can I do for you?
Any information on my husband's murderer?
- Not yet.
But now I have taken the case in my hands.
Now we will know for sure.
Ma'am, I want to talk to you.
But ma'am doesn't want to talk you.
Mr. Kulkarni, take him away.
Please.
Sir.
- Let him speak.
What do you want to say?
Ma'am, I know all this happened because of my mistake.
But give me one chance.
This isn't just a case.
This is about my pride and the respect of my work.
But ma'am doesn't want to give you any chance.
That's it.
My heart says that he is speaking the truth.
But ma'am..
- Just a minute.
I have decided.
I'll speak to the chief minister.
And take special permission for Chatur Singh.
Make arrangements for him to go to South Africa.
South Africa.
Chatur Singh coming
"Chatur Singh."
"Chatur Singh."
Good morning, Mr. Chatur Singh.
"Chatur Singh."
"Chatur Singh."
"Thing.
Thing.
Doing that same thing."
"He is the king with the zing thing."
Welcome to South Africa, Mr. Chatur Singh.
Enjoy your stay.
Taxi.
Who are you?
- I am taxi driver, sir.
I will drop you wherever you want to go.
Come on, let's go in your taxi.
Taxi isn't there.
Taxi is here, sir.
This is a taxi.
- Yes sir.
See.
Taxi's keys.
Light.
This is dust filled carburettor.
This is the horn.
There is dickey at the back.
And this is the seat.
Sit on this seat.
I will drop you wherever you want to go.
Got it?
You are mad.
Everyone says so.
But I don't agree.
- Move.
Let me go.
But I don't understand why you aren't boarding my taxi.
I have been driving taxi since I was two years old.
I am five years old now.
Everyone knows me in Pahadgunj.
Pahadgunj.
This isn't Pahadgunj.
This is Cape town.
- This is Pahadgunj.
Look there.
Pahad (mountain).
Look over there.
Ganj (bald).
Pahad-Gunj.
You're right.
- Yes.
- No.
Mr. Chatur Singh.
Come.
Let's go.
Babban.
Whose man are you, Babban?
Me.
I'm wife's man.
And I am not Babban.
I am Lallan alias Laili.
I am Chatur Singh.
But how do you know?
It is written Vikram Vaital on the trunk in such big letters.
This is Vikram Vaital.
It is Chatur Singh written on it.
That is how I read it.
Where would you like to go?
I won't tell you.
Then sit here.
Your visa will be over.
Then go to Rampur and celebrate honeymoon.
In the case, I want to go to table..
Table Be hotel.
Table Be hotel.
But I will only have coffee there.
I will stay elsewhere.
And I mustn't tell this to anyone.
Correct.
- I will be at the table.
And I'll drop you wherever you have to go.
I..
I..
I..
I didn't tell him.
Should I kill the rascal?
Taxi can stop working.
But it doesn't die.
Everything will be alright.
Go home.
Go home.
He is a nice man.
He seems to be crazy.
Seems to be!
"Chatur Singh Two Star."
"Chatur Singh Two Star."
"Chatur Singh Two Star."
"Chatur Singh Two Star."
"Chatur Singh.. superstar."
May I help you, sir?
One room, please.
Are you Indian?
Yes.
Of course.
So speak in Hindi, sir.
I'm also Indian.
Soniya Verma.
Hi.
Room 735.
Please.
Nice statue.
- Thank you.
Surprising.
She didn't recognize me.
Soniya Verma. 735.
Chatur Singh. 736.
Pappy, you?
- Yes.
Me.
How did you get here?
A disciple is where the guru is.
I was on your flight.
- On my flight?
I didn't see you.
I was in the business class.
And you?
I..
I was flying the plane.
Sir..
You were flying the plane.
What great flying, boss!
Boss, my first ever foreign trip.
First time in a plane.
And that plane's driver was you.
Not a driver, idiot.
Pilot.
Pilot.
Pilot.
I am so lucky.
Pappu.
Pappu.
- No.
No silly.
What are you doing, silly?
God bless.
God bless.
Boss, your passport.
They won't let you go without this.
I know that.
I know that.
What is this?
You have been drinking beer ever since we've arrived.
Come on, we have to leave.
Chatur Singh is staying in our hotel.
Relax, Soniya.
What threat could that idiot be to us?
As it is, he is your admirer.
You.
What are you trying to say?
I mean hug him instead of running away from him.
Soniya, Chatur Singh will help us get ..
..to Gullu Gulfam and those diamonds.
But why would he do that?
Because that fool is convinced that you are innocent.
That is the truth.
I have been framed.
I had to flee here from India because of you.
Yes Soniya.
But don't forget you're doing ..
..all this for your dear brother-in-law.
I wonder what all I am compelled to do in helplessness.
Using a simple innocent man..
I'm ashamed of myself.
Boss, where are you going?
I am off to do shopping.
Shopping?
Are you here to solve the case or to shop, sir?
I am not shopping for myself, but for the country.
New mission.
New get up.
One more thing.
We will be using a code.
I will knock on the door thrice and say 'Balle aur Shaava'.
And on hearing that, you'll knock twice and say 'Shaava aur Balle'.
And then you'll open the door.
Do you get that?
- Yes boss.
Boss, why did you hit me?
Why did you open the door?
Who else can come in three seconds, boss?
Big acts can happen in three seconds.
Boss, this mistake will never happen again.
- Good.
"Thing, thing."
"Doing that same thing."

Brother, many say so.
But me.
I don't agree.
Nonsense.
Nonsense.
- But brother, what does my shop lack?
I had opened it in the previous birth.
I'm running it in this birth.
If you don't believe.
Ask anyone..

This isn't Chandni Chowk.
This is Cape town.
This is Chandni Chowk.

Oh no!
This is not my size.
Sir, that is what I was telling all along.
This is the kiddies section.
You get the kids clothes here.
Where do you get the clothes for adults?
Over here. - "Zing thing." - "Thing, thing."
"Doing that same thing."

All four of them, sir.
Four in one.

Completely, sir.
What a fool!
"Chatur Singh is coming."
"Someone is coming."
"He is coming."
Whamm, bamm, bamm.

He is looking like an absolute cartoon.
He wants to follow you.
Let him.
"Whamm, bamm, bamm."

He can hear the slightest of sounds.
Chatur Singh Two Star.
Excuse me.
I'm feeling a little lonely in this crowd.
Can I join you at your table?
Please.
What are you saying?
What am I saying?
No.
Please sit.
- Thank you.
Why don't you also sit?
After all, this is your table.
So, what's your name?
I'll have to create one.

I mean, I'll have to tell you.
James.
- James.
Nice name.
And last name?
Armani.
- Oh.
Italian.
Well, you speak Hindi very well.
Actually, I'm half Indian and half Italian.
As in my uncle is Bhagnani.
Uncle is Taurani.
And I'm Armani.
Italian Sindhi, right?
Great.
Interesting.
Can I ask about you?
- Of course.
My name is Soniya.
And I'm a killer.
I have been charged with murder..
..of India's famous minister Y.Y. Singh..
..which I never committed.
Of course.
Go on.
Go on.
You know.
Y.Y. Singh was a very corrupt minister.
He had given diamonds worth 50 million..
..to notorious don of this place, Gullu Gulfam.
And Gullu Gulfam is the one who has murdered him.
I want to expose Gullu Gulfam.
And I'm looking for a very good detective for this.
I'm new to this city.
Do you know anyone?
Co-incidentally, I'm on a holiday.
Or I'm Germany's top most detective.
You mean Italy, right?
Yes.
It's a neighbouring country.
Of course.
My mistake.
Sorry.
Well, you Italians are fond of just two things, right?
Good clothes.
Which you have worn from tea to toe.
And second.
Good liquor.
So should we toast on our new partnership?
You know.
Waiter.

"I'm so smitten by love."
"My heart is yours now."
"Oh God, give me any reward you feel like."
"I've dedicated my life to you."
"I will die.
I will be ruined.
I will get destroyed now."
"I want to live with you, sweetheart."
"I want to die with you, sweetheart."
"I will love you, sweetheart."
"I will love you, sweetheart."
"I want to live with you, sweetheart."
"I want to die with you, sweetheart."
"I will love you, sweetheart."
"I will love you, sweetheart."
Owning property is now like sitting on a gold mine.
You have been sleeping in my car the entire night, drunk.
Are you awake now?
- Where am I?
Good morning.
Who are you?
- You forgot so soon, Chatur Singh.
I am Lallan alias Lehri.
Taxi driver.
Not Chatur Singh.
James Armani.
James Armani.
Surprising.
It took me six months to become Lallan.
And you became Chela Ramani..
..from Chatur Singh in one day
James Armani.
How did I come here?
You were dead drunk and fell asleep in my taxi.
Why didn't you wake me up?
- There were two reasons.
Firstly, it's wrong to wake up a sleeping person.
And secondly when the taxi's meter is running..
..then who minds.
Hello.
My 1000 Rand.
Take it tomorrow.
- Meaning?
Put it in my account.
You don't have a dime in your pocket..
..and say that "Put it in my account".
Hello, Chatur Singh.
James Armani.
I don't get furious.
It's okay.
Pappu, open the door.
Pappu, open the door.
Pappu, I know you..
..are standing on the other side of the door.
You won't listen this way.
Pappu.
Pappu.
Pappu.
'Balle and shava.'
- Wrong, boss.
'Balle o shava.'
Shava balle, sir.
Shava balle.
15 minutes ago when I was madly knocking on the door..
..you were standing behind the door.
- Yes, boss.
And you were watching me from the keyhole.
- Yes, boss.
And yet you didn't open the door.
- No, boss.
And I landed in this predicament because of you.
But, boss.
You didn't give me the code.
You break your own rules, boss.
Excuse me.
Boss, what about the mission?
Yes, on that note I remembered.
Note it, note it, note it.
3:15.
I am completely assured that Soniya is innocent.
The real murderer is someone else.
And Soniya.. has madly fallen for me.
No, boss, Soniya is the murderer.
Soniya is not the murderer.
I..
- Sandwich.
Diamonds.
I need the diamonds.
"Chatur Singh."
"Chatur Singh."
"Chatur Singh."
"Chatur Singh.
Chatur Singh."
Morning, Soniya.
- Good morning.
So how am I looking?
- Terrible.
I mean terrific.
- By the way.. yesterday..
You were just fantastic yesterday.
You were rock steady even after drinking so much.
Like a true Italian.
Normally we drink that much alcohol for breakfast in Italy.
So its breakfast time now.
Shall I order it?
- No, no.
Bread butter will do.
- I see.
Soniya, you didn't ask why I have worn this suit.
Why did you wear it?
This is no ordinary suit, Soniya.
A great detective Colonel Shaki had worn this suit.
Look.
When someone looks at me from this side..
..I will look like a different man.
Different from this side.
- Wow!
Different from this side.
And if he looks at me from behind..
..then I will be practically invisible.
- Very smart.
But shall we go now?
- Go where?
Mission.
Gullu Gulfam.
Mission Gullu Gulfam.
Soniya, I will certainly solve this case.
This is Chatur Singh's promise.
- James Armani?
I didn't say Chatur Singh, I swear.
Sorry, my mistake.
Let's go.
- Let's go.
Wait.
Who do you want to meet?
- Why should I tell you?
Go back everyone.
- In that case.
We want to see Gullu Gulfam.
Gullu Gulfam's time is over.
We have a new don now.
Don Chungwaa.
Chungwaa?
Is he a dog?
- Lets see.
Merriment.
Only merriment.
Boss, the party is here to see you.
Murder.
Rape.
Drugs.
Ipod, DVD piracy.
You will get everything at Chungwaa's.
What is your name and the job?
- Me, Chatur Singh Two Star.
James Armani.
- I swear I didn't say it.
My fault as usual.
James Armani, Italian.
Are you Chinese?
- No, no, I am a Punjabi..
..but my heart is Chinese.
Actually 15 years ago when India and Pakistan..
..were playing their cricket match finals..
..I had a heart attack while watching the match.
My budget was only Rs.7,000 for a new heart.
In the entire world one could get a heart for 7,000 only in China.
That's why I got a heart from there.
Made in China.
Tell me your job.
I want to meet your boss Gullu Gulfam.
Don't even utter his name.
He's a rascal, scoundrel, dog.
For ten years I worked under that rascal as his right-hand.
The scoundrel didn't tell me where he stashed the wealth.
And suddenly one day he met with an accident.
He lost his memory.
We were reduced to rags.
Then I gathered every Rand.
I built this empire again gathering every Rand.
Are you ashamed of doing such a thing?
- No.
Not that.
South Africa's currency is called Rand.
Rand.
Tell me your job.
I will only tell Gullu Gulfam.
Seems like they have an old relation with him.
Are they here for the diamonds as well?
I won't spare you?
- Hands up.
That's a cigarette packet.
Lower it.
Stop.
Look there.
'Shop, shop, shop, shop.'
'Cloth shop.'
'Shop, shop, shop, shop.'
'Shop, shop, shop, shop.'
He's that madman.
Shop, taxi.
But what will we do with this Chungwaa?
Leave him to his state.
He will die himself.
Didn't you hear?
His heart is made in China.
Boss, why did you let them go?
I let them go intentionally.
So that I can understand their plan.
Jack.
- Yes.
Keep an eye on him and Gullu Gulfam.
- Yes, boss.
Inform me as soon as they do something.
- Yes, boss.
The capsicum is really big.
How much did you pay for it?
- Rs.20 for one.
Rs.20 for one.
It costs only 12 in Nashik.
Where are you going?
- To return it.
Why?
- Buy it from Nashik.
Are you crazy?
Keep it.
Fine.
Your phone is ringing.
- It's yours, sir.
Hello, Sinha.
- Rajkumar Sinha, here.
Who is this?
You are missing from your office today again.
No, sir, I just arrived at the market half an hour ago.
Who is this?
Seems like you sell stuff on the street in free time.
No, sir, I just came here for some shopping.
Who is this?
Come to the office tomorrow at 9 o'clock sharp.
Of course I will.
By the way who is this?
Pappu Panther.
You rascal, I will kill you like a dog.
How dare you call me Sinha?
If your name is Sinha then why would I call you Bachchan?
Who is Bachchan?
- Abhishek Bachchan, sir.
Abhishek.
Okay, Abhishek.
Boss has run out of money.
Transfer 5,000 dollars to his account by tomorrow morning.
I did last week.
It was all spent in travelling around South Africa.
In dancing, singing.
I will shoot that Chatur Singh, hang him..
..and inject him with poison.
Sinha, don't talk nonsense about boss.
And don't you..
The money should be transferred by tomorrow morning.
"The money should be transferred.."
Who do you think who am I?
- Salesman.
Salesman.
I am not..
- Sir.
Sir, your laughter tablets.
Yes, I am a salesman.
Kulkarni, we are going to South Africa.
South Africa, sir.
- Yes, South Africa.
Okay, okay, okay..
220140.
Control yourself, sir.
My, God.
Then I should have been in coma.
I won't spare this Chatur Singh.
Sir, what enmity do you have with me?
Why, what happened?
Sir, we reached Cape Town after a 11 hour flight.
And for the past 2 12 hours..
..you are making me walk in this freezing weather.
Kulkarni..
- I don't want to walk anymore, sir.
Kulkarni, walking is good for health.
Why don't you understand that?
Sir, why are we here?
- To catch Chatur Singh.
If we continue at this speed then..
..we won't be able to catch him in the next 2 12 years, sir.
Oh my, God.
I will retire in 2 12 years.
Okay, okay.
Call a cab.
Call a cab.
Why did you alight from the car?
And why.. why are you staring at us?
Are you Indian?
- Yes, you look like an Indian as well.
Greet us affectionately, we are Indians.
To hell with greeting affectionately..
..my heart's on fire.
- What?
My heart's on fire.
Heart's on fire.
- Heart's on fire.
Now first I will collect the fare..
..and then take you to your destination, that's all.
"Collect the fare first".
Does sir look like a thief or a con?
Even he didn't look like a con as well.
Who are you talking about?
That rascal, scoundrel, insolent, stupid Chatur Singh.
Two Star?
- You know him?
I am here to catch him.
What did he do?
- What did he do?
He was drunk, roaming around with girls..
..didn't pay my 1000 Rand.
And even changed his name.
James Armani.
- What?
James Armani.
- James Armani.
James Armani.
I will shoot him, hang him
..and inject him with poison.
Sir, BP.
Control yourself.
To hell with BP..
Take me to James Armani.
Sir, Chatur Singh.
- Take me to Chatur Singh.
Come on, come on.
How will we find him in this huge Cape Town?
I can understand your pain, Soniya.
You can place your head on my shoulder and cry.
But I don't feel like crying.
Then you can take a nap.
But I am not sleepy either.
Why convey your feelings so complicatedly, Chatur Singh?
I mean, James Armani.
- This time it's your mistake.
My mistake, sorry.
Gullu.
- Gulfam.
Gullu.
Gulfam.
Don't worry, Soniya.
I am right behind you.
Passengers travelling by Panthankot express 2050..
..that they should jump from platform no.3..
..and flee to platform no.1.
He is crazy.
All the passengers think similarly about me.
But wonder why I don't believe it.
Sweetu.
Quickly board the Pathankot train.
Otherwise you will miss it.
This isn't Pathankot but Cape Town.
This is Pathankot.
- How?
Look, Pathan.
Here's the coat.
Pathankot.
- He is right.
He is wrong.
Look, everyday he is in a different mood.
Today he is in a mood to be a train.
Stop arguing and board the train..
..otherwise he will keep annoying us the entire day.
Sweetu, stop talking with brother.
The train is ready to leave.
He is calling you 'brother'.
- No problem.
For the sake of the mission I am ready to be a father.
Passenger, you were here to drop someone..
..why did you board it?
That's fine.
That makes another passenger.
Did you buy the ticket?
- Yes.
Charlie, Gullu Gulfam has been kidnapped.
What were you doing..
..when Gullu Gulfam was being kidnapped?
Boss, you asked me only to keep an eye.
And I kept an eye and now I am telling you.
Why didn't you kidnap him?
Boss, he kidnapped him.
He kidnapped him.
- Who?
He did.
He kidnapped him.
Am I disturbing you?
- Quiet!
And what were you doing behind me?
Does this look like a cheap hotel?
You come and go, come and go, come and go.
And why do you take me so lightly?
I am the don here.
Who am I?
- Don!
Don!
Don!
Don!
- Don!
Don!
Don!
Don!
- Don!
See, even these people call me Don.
And I am a detective, sir?
- Yes.
Shall we get to the point?
You and I both are waiting for Gullu Gulfam's memory to return.
You are after the diamonds as well, aren't you?
As soon as we find the diamonds, we will divide it 50-50.
You can make one necklace and I will make one.
- No.
I get the necklace and you get the ring. 80-20.
Done.
Gullu Gulfam lost his memory in this bungalow.
And he will regain it in this bungalow.
I need this bungalow for this mission.
Merriment.
Only merriment.
"Jump up.
Jump up."
"Go."
"The journey begins from Chandni Chowk."
"Look, Gullu Gulfam's Ferrari has set out."
"Look, who is paying the price for whose mistake."
"Look, he has set out grandly."
"Watch.
One better than.."
"One better than.."
"One better than the other."
"Watch the fun."
"Watch the fun."
"Watch the fun."
"Watch the fun."
"Watch, watch, watch my bike."
"You can run but you can't hide."
"What's the secret you decide?"
"It's the search for the diamonds."
"Tell me, tell me who is it?
Where is he a don of?"
"There is just one thing on his mind.
Don't say a thing."
"Ice diamonds bling, bling.
Got to have it just can't stop."
Money money ching ching". "Got to have it just can't stop."
"Man you better talk, talk.
You mind's in a lock, lock."
"Say it quickly, time slips-by tick-tock."
"Where's the extortion?"
"Whose contract?"
"He is completely prepared today."
"Everyone knows who he is."
"It's his repute."
"It's his fame."
"Everyone salutes you, watch."
"Gullu.
Gullu.

"One better than the other."
"Watch the fun."
"Watch the fun."
"Watch the fun."
"Watch the fun."
Chatur Singh, the police has surrounded you.
I have witnessed your actions since morning.
Shame on you.
You dare talk to me in the commissioner's voice.
Chatur Singh, he's the commissioner.
You dare talk in the commissioner's sycophant's voice.
You fool, he's the commissioner in disguise.
You dare talk to me in that poor taxi driver's voice.
Who me?
- Or me?
Did you recognise me?
What the..
Sir.
Chatur Singh Two Star reporting, sir.
How dare you slap commissioner Rajkumar Sinha?
Sir.
Are you here on a holiday?
Shut up, don't talk nonsense.
I know you have been having a ball, singing around..
..for the past many days.
Tomorrow we have to go back with Soniya.
Sir, we just need two days to complete the mission impossible.
Give me two days time, sir.
Will I roam around in this get up for two days?
Sir, I have thought of a great character for you.
Really?
What do I have to be?
Doctor, engineer, journalist.
Sir, doctor will be good.
- Doctor.
Only merriment.
Who is he?
- He is world famous doctor.
Doctor Jhatka.
- Doctor Jhatka.
Oh, my.
Where is the patient that needs treatment?
How will you treat him?
You don't have a bag.
Nor any medicine.
Nor any injection in your pocket.
Tell him that our style of treatment is different.
No Homeopathy, no Allopathy.
Only 'Thokopathy' (bashing).
What is this?
What is this?
Sweetu, who are these new characters?
Gullu, he's the doctor.
He is here to treat you?
- Am I crazy?
Yes, you are crazy.
Okay, no problem.
Doctor, many say this.
But actually I don't believe it.
It is acute case of patient biting..
..but not accepting the situation according to the..
..Indian law, the situation is very tense.
You might have seen in Indian films that normally..
..the point where the patient has suffered injury..
..due to which he loses his memory..
..he regains his memory if you hit on the same point.
Meaning.
- Meaning, start bashing him.
Come on.
- Just a minute.
One last chance.
What are small, round things?
Diamonds or grams?
Calling me, okay.
Grams.
- Bash him.
What are you doing?
Why are you beating me?
Beat him.
Beat him.
What are you doing?
Beat him.
Stop.
Hey, where are the diamonds?
Where are the diamonds?
Where are the diamonds?
He doesn't say where the diamonds are.
What did you do?
You killed the person who knew about the diamonds.
Gullu is dead.
What about Soniya now?
How will I prove myself innocent now?
Chungwaa.
Who woke me up?
Who are they?
Throw them out.
The scoundrel has regained his memory.
Hey you.
Enough of your charade.
Tell us where are the diamonds?
'I have regained my memory..'
'..but these diamonds will get me killed.'
'If you want to save your life and the diamonds..
..then Gullu Gulfam, say goodbye to your memory.'
'Bye.
Bye.'
Heera.
Heera.
Heera.
Heera is in Punjab.
How did Heera (diamonds) reach Punjab?
No, he was born in Punjab.
He ate butter in Punjab.
He ate clarified-butter in Punjab.
He lives in Punjab.
Heera, my uncle.
Heera Kartar Singh.
Call my uncle.
Uncle Heera..
- Wait.
Why are you beating the poor man?
But our diamond partnership?
To hell with those cheap diamonds worth 50 billion.
Get a little emotional.
- Fine.
Even my Chinese heart has melted.
When destiny's against you what can one do.
I..
I will go cry.
Touchy, touchy, touchy, touchy.
- I know.
Put the car in gear.
Press the accelerator.
Take it on the highway.
Small, round.
Are not grams.
Are diamonds.
Diamonds.
This isn't cherry but Chatur.
I can hear the softest murmur.
Chatur Singh.
Two Star.
Who is it?
It's me.
Me.
Who?
- Pappu Panther.
A lion is scared of a chimpanzee.
I am not a lion but stupid.
- Stupid.
Half lion, half fool.
The fool was scared, not the lion.
It's me.
Thank God.
- By the way, Armani.
Your idea of this get up, top class.
Soniya.
No one would have thought..
..of such a get up in a thousand years.
Gullu Gulfam has regained his memory.
I will solve this case.
I will return diamonds worth millions to the department.
And I will get myself promoted.
Just yourself.
Then go on the mission alone.
If I get promoted then you will get promoted automatically.
We are on the same team working together.
And in the past.. past 1000 years..
..have you seen anyone take such a get up?
Merriment.
Only merriment.
- Boss, you?
No one would have donned such a get up in a thousand years.
Boss, are we leaving the underworld..
..and joining a circus?
You made me a dog, and you are roaming around as a gorilla.
Shut up.
I want the diamonds.
Diamonds.
Merriment.
Only merriment.
No one in a thousands years..
..would have thought of this elephant get up.
You are genius, Gullu Gulfam.
Boss, elephant.
Diamonds.
Only diamonds.
Diamonds.
Small, round.
These are not grams.
Are diamonds.
Gullu Gulfam's diamonds.
Attack.
Get it.
My diamonds.
"Chatur Singh."
Get it.
- Take the diamonds.
Move back.
Hello, sir.
Something is wrong here.
Send the force immediately.
I got it.
I got it.
I am don.
Gorilla don.
Give me the diamonds.
Gullu Gulfam's diamonds.
- Armani.
Come on, boss.
I got the diamonds.
Get it.
Who is he?
- Give it to me.
Here.
- He is running with the diamonds.
I have the diamonds now.
- Catch him.
Catch him.
He has the diamonds.
Hello.
- Hello.
Sinha, why are you running like a railway engine?
Sir, I am on a mission.
Who is this?
- Then why did you stop?
Is there a signal?
- Who is speaking?
He took the diamonds.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Boss.
- Come on, Armani.
Come on.
Come quickly.
Catch.
My diamonds.
Boss, she is fleeing with the diamonds.
Armani, catch.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Pappu.
Kulkarni.
Come on, pass it on.
Here, catch.
- Where is it gone?
Sixer.
Where is it stuck?
Hello, Sinha.
- Speaking.
Where are you?
I am soaring through the air for a promotion.
Sinha, did you get demoted?
- Who is it?
Pappu Panther.
Stop.
Catch him.
Hello.
- Hello, Sinha.
Rajkumar Sinha.
Who is this?
Roaming around in the garden dressed as a rabbit for a carrot.
I am here on a mission.
By the way who is speaking?
- Pappu Panther.
Pappu Panther.
How dare you call me Sinha?
If I don't call you Sinha will I call you Bachchan?
That's also true.
- Yes.
If you don't call me Sinha then..
Pappu.
Where am I stuck?
I want the diamonds.
The diamonds.
That's mine.
Gorilla don.
Armani, catch.
Yes, well done.
Why did you throw the diamonds?
The diamonds.
Hey, Armani.
Where are the diamonds?
- Which diamonds?
You were standing right here, I threw it to you.
Try to remember.
Who is the other one?
"Yeah."
My diamonds.
- Boss.
My diamonds.
- Boss.
Pappu Panther reporting, sir.
Diamonds.
- Wait!
First take off your mask.
You.
Savitri, you?
That means Charlie..
- Yes.
I killed my husband Y.Y. Singh.
And I used you for this job.
Actually it was an easy death for that lowly man.
My father made that pitiable insurance agent a king.
And he killed my father.
He seized the entire property.
That is why I killed him.
Madam, we are all really sad to hear your story.
But regrettably according to the law you are a criminal..
..so, Kulkarni.
- Sir.
Arrest her.
- Sir.
Madam, please.
Come.
Chatur Singh.
- Yes.
Give me the diamonds.
- Why, sir?
Because I am senior..
..and I will keep those small diamonds intact.
Pappu.
- Yes, boss.
Note it.
12th October, 12:40 in the afternoon.
The diamonds which Chatur Singh is holding..
..won't turn it over to the commissioner.
What are you saying?
And I will hand it over to the D.G.P.
- Yes, boss.
Kulkarni.
- Waiting, sir.
James Irani.
- I swear I didn't say it.
Naturally my fault.
- Correct.
But at least admit it now, Chatur Singh.
Taxi.
Taxi.
Accident.
Taxi.
- Gullu.
Taxi, shop, train.
Now for Mumbai..
Kulkarni.
- Sir.
The BP is normal though I didn't get the diamonds.
Sir, did you take a laughter pill.
- No, I don't need it.
You need it, sir.
You will need after the news I brought for you.
I have been promoted.
- No, sir.
Any more guesses?
Something to do with Chatur Singh?
- Yes, sir.
What about him?
Chatur Singh no longer Two star.
Has he committed suicide?
- No, sir.
Chatur Singh Two Star has now become..
..Chatur Singh Three Star
Sir.
Sir, control.
I cannot control it.
I cannot laugh either.
Sir, calm down please.
"Chatur Singh.."
Boss, what are we doing in this shop?
- Fool.
New mission, new getup.
Chatur Singh..
Three Star.
"Chatur Singh."
"What if the rooster lays an egg?"
"I am the one who thinks like that."
"Rooster laying an egg."
"Have you ever seen that?"
"What if the rooster lays an egg?"
"I am the one who thinks like that."
"I have my own free will."
"I can do whatever I want."
"He is the king with the zing thing."
"Not a puppet on a swing thing."
"I am Chatur Singh..
Two Star."
"Chatur Singh..
Two Star."
"I am Chatur Singh..
Two Star."
"I am Chatur Singh."
"Singh.
Singh.
Singh.
Singh."
"I am Chatur Singh..
Two Star."
"I am Chatur Singh..
Two Star."
"I am Chatur Singh..
Two Star."
"I am Chatur Singh."
"Singh.
Singh.
Singh.
Singh."
"I have checked the entire area."
"This area is completely secure."
"No problem."
"As long as I am here no one can come here."
"What is this?"
"Don't be scared."
"It's a hen."
"I thought it might be a hawk."
"But, no."
"The rooster will lay an egg."
"Superman is my student."
"We have played hide-n-seek together."
"Yesterday Spiderman had said."
"This is Chatur Singh's area."
"The fool will take the cake."
"The dumb will sing in his mind."
"The river flows backwards."
"So let it flow if it does."
"He is the king with the zing thing."
"Not a puppet on a swing thing."
- Nice mannequin.
"I am Chatur Singh..
Two Star."
"I am Chatur Singh..
Two Star."
- Boss.
Boss.
Boss, what happened?
Fool.
Did you see?
He didn't recognize us?
"Chatur Singh.. two star."
I am so fortunate.
- No, no.
"Chatur Singh."
Look, if you don't eat it, right, then the helicopter will crash.
Anyone watching, thinking we know fuck all about knowing fuck all about owt, needs to watch their back...
So you've had your Labour reclassifying skunk, sending prices sky-high, literally, literally taking the grass from its own roots!
Now you've got your condemnation,
Liberals noshing Tories like altar boys picking dimps up!
Have we had a national fucking stroke... or what?
Is revolution a word or was it never?
Anybody watching needs to know, we cope better than average with irony in Chatsworth.
Well, for fuck's sake, we live in Manchester and they charge us for water?
!
I wandered lonely as a clown, necking mushrooms rarely found.
This green and pleasant land in ancient times!
Yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak!
It's not theirs any more.
This is our England now.
Paaaarty!
I always felt I was different, I never believed that I fitted in.
Life is... ordinary, but I was special.
I used to think, "I'm not a part of this, I can't be.
"I must be adopted!"
My real mum and dad were film stars.
Yeah, and they couldn't look after me because of their careers and that, but one day... one day...
Fish and chips!
They'll come back for me.
My real parents will tip up in a fuck-off limo and whisk me off to a better life...
Excuse me, mister, I really want to do magic.
Can you teach me?
And then I learnt...
Fuck off, kid.
That there's no such thing as magic or the Tooth Fairy or Father Christmas.
It's like flying pigs, they don't exist.
We just have to make do with what we've got.
Come on, it's good for you.
Look, if you don't eat it, right, then Mr Cuddles' banana brains will get splattered all over the wall!
I know how you feel.
I can't do a thing with this today.
It's flat as a gymnast's chest!
Helicopter!
Look, if you don't eat it, right, then the helicopter will crash.
Let 'em die.
Is there a brew going, or what?
Yeah, in the kettle.
That's mine!
Got your name in it?
Yeah, it has!
Is that porridge?
No, it's a kebab
She prefers Chocky-Choc Pops, with a bit of sugar on.
Is that what you feed her?
It's no wonder she won't touch it, she's holding out for a sugar fix.
That stuff will rot her teeth.
They're only her baby ones, she'll get a new set.
If she gets older!
The shit you're pumping into her!
You're not fit to be a parent.
What, and you are?
Well, I'm more qualified than you are!
Who's the daddy...
I'm the fucking daddy!
Who's the daddy?
!
Where's your fucking tool?
You're a fucking tool!
Pack it in!
It's not about you, or about how good you are, it's about her!
Smaller spoon.
It's like when you're feeding a poorly snake, y'know, you chop up the mice with the scissors.
Right, you set of lazy bastards!
Morning.
I've got piles of bills here falling out me arse and what are you lot doing about it?
Fuck all!
I need every single one of you worthless shites to start pulling in some serious money!
Today!
I'm out there grafting already.
Thought we were going to town?
Get a new trackie?
I've got a golden shower booked in at ten.
I've got me community service.
Prancing about in tights in't community service.
Yer what?
I picked up needles and shit when I did it.
Him?
Doing drama, plays and that.
Maybe the magistrate saw something in me.
What, like big fucking gayness?
You're not me dad!
So I reckon the magistrate was knocked out by me.
Saw that I had a bit of something about me.
Bastard, you bastard, you fucking bastard.
Cos I've done loads of acting, me.
See how you like that!
I was the Inn Keeper.
Well, I played an opportunistic businessman in a historical drama.
- huh.
And we made a film, Taxi Driver, it was fucking mint.
I mean it was mint.
Soz.
I just really want to make a success out of this,
I think I'm turning a corner, you know.
Yeah, if I can just get this sentence out of the way...
Bastard!
Good news?
It's my ex, ran off with my best friend!
You really missing her?
I'll get his knees done if you want?
Get him put in a wheelchair and that...
Joke!
No, I know what it's like to be in an abusive relationship.
Me step-dad nicks my clothes, right.
He's using one of my t-shirts to sleep in!
And he hits me, I mean, like, proper hits me.
He's cracked a few of me ribs and that.
In here.
I think there's been a mistake.
You shouldn't have called the magistrate a "fucking mong".
He was a fucking mong.
He'd had a stroke.
And?
Dropped down dead from a brain tumour.
Age?
57.
Here's another good one.
Father of two, 47, knocked down by a bus, 47.
Morbid old crones.
They make Goth Dave look like a children's television presenter.
Two halves of cider, one with black.
That's the one with black.
Can I have some cash for the pool table?
Cheers.
He acts like a child, but then again he is, isn't he?
Shouldn't you get him a lemonade too?
Or does the sugar make him hyper?
Careful what you say now.
There are children about and we don't want them picking up any bad language now, do we?
Mummy?
Can I have a bag of crisps, please?
You need to man-up!
"That, my... dear young friend,
"is the... theory
"that the corrupt French...
"drama has been propounding..."
Aw, you've been smoking!
This will be a million times better than the shit you're inhaling there, brother.
It's Salford Skunk.
Shop local, like it.
Thai Stick.
Pure quality.
I'm autistic so it focuses me mind and it's good for... concentration.
D'you like it here?
S'all right, usually a bit better when we haven't got The Thrush.
Irritating twat.
And to be honest, I prefer numbers to words, me, anyway.
For example... from here, I can see... 80 trees, 72 yellow lines,
412 railings, 17 traffic lights, 12 satellite dishes, 3 cameras, 64 windows,
24 cars, and two dead pigeons.
You know all that just by looking at them?
The other thing I like is...
Never mind that!
D'ya fancy going to a casino one night?
The other thing I like is women.
I want to shag a woman.
I bet you've shagged loads of women.
What's it like?
Messy.
Anyway, fuck that!
Look... d'ya want to come to the casino one night with me?
Put in some serious money?
Get me a woman to shag and I'll come to the casino.
The community service dickheads proudly present...
Litter Pick on the M60.
We're a cutting-edge group, right, with important things to say.
So have I.
Get a fuckin' job!
I'll show ya.
Show me.
You think I'm a joke, you think I'm worth fuck all.
It's not just me, Mickey.
It's pretty much across the board, mate.
Kel...
Fancy making a million quid for Mam?
Boom!
What the fuck are you playing at?
Duh!
You'll be wearing that internally.
I've got a list of jobs as long as me arse, and you piss off out of here!
I was manning up, like you wanted.
Leave you at home doing the jobs, and me come here, like a man.
You tell 'er, kid.
It's not how it works ...
not in my house.
Your list of jobs.
It's about time you proved yourself to be a man... my man ... all right?
!
Winner stays on!
Now!
Ha-ha-ha!
As for your conduct towards Miss Cardew,
I must say that your... simple, innocent girl like that...
Do you like this?
Excuse me.
Chatting away while people are working is hugely disrespectful.
You got something to say?
Why are they doing this?
Did they choose it?
No disrespect or 'owt, but...
I don't understand it.
By the looks of it, neither do this lot.
I'm sick and tired of men telling me what's what.
Time and time again, they think they know best, and they know f... jack all!
You, Michael Maguire, have yourself a one-way ticket right out of here, direct to prison.
Do not pass go and do not collect £200!
Wait!
I'm telling the courts you're in breach of your order.
All right, I'm sorry...
Contributed nothing, except negativity, whipping them up into a frenzy!
There won't be a revolution here!
Please!
Not on my watch!
Miss?
Miss, wait!
She pushed me!
She fell.
Pushed.
Please!
Let me out!
Success.
I picked up the child allowance from the post office, went to court, paid the fines, dropped the wash off and did the shop.
Who's this?
It's the same pram!
Flat-out asleep.
Cilla or Latifah?
Cilla.
Look, I've proved I can do stuff, shown I can sort problems ...
I've manned up.
But can you think for yourself?
I don't know what you want me to say.
Yeah!
Yeah, I can think for myself.
And pigs won't fly.
I can!
Prove it.
We've got to find 500 quid before midnight.
Have we?
It's a hypothetical case.
Right.
So where are you going to get it from?
The bank?
You haven't got a bank account.
Hypothetical bank?
For fuck's sake, Mickey!
Billy.
You can't get it from the bank, not from any of our stashes, sell anything or hurt anybody.
So where are you going to get 500 quid from... tonight?
Think.
My mum used to work in this office.
It had a box of petty cash... 500 quid's worth?
More like a grand.
I don't have to get it, do I?
I like lemonade and sara-cong...
Come on, please.
She fancies you.
But I fancy her, right?
So stay away!
All right.
Hiya.
Right...
Ten-minute fag break.
I know they're a bit different to how I described 'em...
I'm used to it, I do different every day.
This is it.
Are you Mickey's girlfriend?
No!
No, she's just here to help out, you know, erm, lend a hand.
You can have a brew, then.
Are you all right to use the kettle?
I mean, you're allowed?
So, where's this Rain Man who's going to make us some serious money?
What play will we do instead?
It's one I'm writing myself.
It's the story of a poor, misunderstood genius, rejected by everyone around him.
He wants to fit in, he strives for it, but... no-one gets him.
You lot know what it's like.
Feeling like you don't fit in?
We do fit in.
But what about when people call you names and that?
Names?
Yeah...
Window-lickers, biffs, retards.
People don't call me names like that.
What do they call you, then?
Terry.
What play would you like to do?
Mamma Mia!
Marley Me!
Avatar!
They're all films, not plays.
Stuart Little?
I saw a play once, it were in German, think it was about a lesbian trying to hang a curtain over a broken window.
Lasted three hours.
It were fucking brilliant.
We're not doing that.
What do you think we should do?
What was the last play you saw?
Nativity?
What d'you have to say that for?
Christmas is ages away!
That was the last play I saw.
It was the last play I was in at school.
I was the innkeeper.
Were you any good?
Go on.
Go on!
I was... brilliant.
Just gonna go for a slash.
Whoa!
What d'ya want?
What're you doing?
!
Not what I want, what I can give you.
The best suck-off you've ever had.
All right... stud?
Wait, listen.
Whoa Whoa, you don't want me!
Yeah, I do.
Just get off, will ya!
I don't care if it's little.
It's like a baby's arm holding an apple, right?
Un-hard.
Stop!
You want to do it here?
Right now?
Casino first.
Then we'll do whatever you want... sugar lips.
Don't you fancy me?
No.
I do.
You'd let me suck you off if you really thought I was pretty.
You are pretty!
It's just...
I'm not the right man for you, Lise.
I'm no good.
I'm useless.
'Waste of space.
'Lazy, pathetic, pointless.'
Never amount to anything.
What are you for, Mickey?
What the fuck are you for?
You need someone that won't let you down, someone who's dependable.
A real man like... like Terry.
Terry?
!
Big time.
I've seen the way he looks at you and that.
He'd look after you as well.
Y'know, he's a real man, a protector.
He'd pick you up, in his arms.
And everyone would watch as he carried you... in his big, strong arms.
With your head leant against his chest, his rock-hard ripped and cut chest, pecs like stone, nipples like wheelnuts.
The heat of him, his breath on your face, his heart beating through his solid chest, as he holds you tight, being held close and tight.
So, you're gay.
Look, wait!
Don't say owt, will you?
Keep it between the two of us?
Your secret's safe with me.
We won't say a word either.
I won't, as long as you don't tell anyone I've got Downs Syndrome.
Deal.
Been years since I did a burglary.
We all used to do it together, me, Paddy, the kids.
Proper family stuff.
Happy days.
It was always a bit of a turn-on for me.
I'm getting a bit of a wide-on now.
Job first, though.
Come on.
We all have skills, right?
I'm great on post codes.
Name a place.
Go on, test me.
Test me!
Chester Zoo?
CH2.
Blackpool Pleasure Beach?
!
FY4.
Brilliant!
Buckingham Palace?
!
Yeah, all right!
Fuckin' 'ell!
I know every word to Gladiator, but it won't make us a million.
SW1 1AA.
Sorry.
Number boy's skills, however, are a different kettle of fish.
A kettle of fish?
Limo.
Casino.
Let's go to work.
Hit me!
He's fucking useless!
Lost every fucking penny!
He told me he was great with numbers!
0808 157 2020.
Pizza delivery!
I'm on about cards, Raymond!
Fucking cards!
You can't even count to 21, you prick!
Hit me!
Don't tempt me!
What was all that "400 windows, 70 doors" bollocks?
!
Every day I have a smoke out the back and I...
Count it all.
Stops me getting bored.
Can we have sex now?
Unbelievable.
I believe there was a rehearsal here last night.
A rehearsal without an appropriate leader, I.e. you!
We went to the casino.
Well, there won't be any more rehearsals, not now, not ever.
The building is closed until further notice.
You can't do that.
Can, and have.
And what's it got to do with the talking sex doll?
You can't shut the building!
I can and I have.
Health and safety.
If Lise continues to insist that she didn't push me down the stairs, then I must have slipped and the building closes until the Health and Safety Executives have investigated.
Thank you!
Mum?
And don't forget, no play, no community service!
Bye-bye, outside, hello, Strangeways.
You've no sense of a dramatic exit, have you?
Brake's stuck, sorry.
Here y'are.
I'd walk away from them if I could, the play and everything, if it meant I weren't walking towards prison.
Thanks a lot.
No offence, it's just we've got a few rivals inside at the moment, y'know.
Wouldn't be much of a holiday for me.
I could tell them I pushed her.
No.
She'd let us back into the building.
She won't, she's an evil bitch.
That must be destroyed!
Steady on.
Sorry.
We can find somewhere else for the play.
And keep Mickey out of Sing Sing.
Where?
You two are all over each other like a tic on a tramp's vest.
What's the secret?
We've discovered the secret to happiness.
White wine and Night Nurse?
Doing something together we both enjoy.
D'you fancy doing it again?
Tonight?
You know I'm only using the play as a ruse, right?
Yeah?
Yeah.
I'm training 'em up, aren't I?
Think about it.
They'll be the best drug dealers in the world.
Methodical, practical.
They won't use the produce and the best thing is, the filth won't suspect them.
Look at 'em.
What the fuck's this?
Attack of the...
Bollocks!
You smelly old tramp.
It's time we started standing up for ourselves.
Fucking set of...
Before you say owt,
I know they're going to kill me, one day.
It's not you I'm worried about, it's your baby.
Your baby doesn't have a choice.
I'm not pregnant, sweetheart!
Trapped wind and a little bit of heartburn.
Always going to the toilet.
You're having a baby.
Great news!
Great news.
Jamie has said that we can rehearse and put the show on in here, providing... you lot run a few errands for him.
£10 each, yeah?
And we'll invite a few heads from the council, see if we can get a bit of funding and then we can open our very own centre right here in the Chatsworth!
Or somewhere else?
Yeah!
Now come on, you little band of biffers!
You wanker!
Fuck off, wanker!
Cock off!
Do you think this is gonna work?
It has to.
Not just for me freedom, but also... to show those snide fuckers round here, always taking the piss.
Are you sure about this?
Yes!
But in the Bible,
Joseph didn't saw anyone in half.
It's artistic license.
It doesn't say that he didn't saw anyone in half.
And he was a joiner, so he'd have had saws and shit, and maybe a bit of curiosity.
Trust me!
It's a boy.
I'm not pregnant.
The ring never lies.
It's a boy.
My husband is infertile.
Funny.
But if you've only been having sex with your husband...
Guess this isn't just about the paint on my carpet?
Want a bit of help, sweetheart?
Cost you.
What happened to the milk of human kindness?
Turned to cheese.
20 quid an hour ... all the help you need.
One part white spirit and two parts water... shift that in next to no time.
OK, I'm not a big believer in miracles, especially not round here, so we can rule out another immaculate conception... and Shane's infertile.
It's Marty.
You never go bareback!
It wasn't business.
It was more than that.
Are you sure?
What happens when it all turns to shit?
What am I gonna do?
We can sort this, yeah.
I'm not getting rid of it.
This is all we've...
Me and Shane, it's all we've ever wanted and...
I can't tell him.
Well, you're gonna have to tell him something.
I can't!
He's gonna find out sooner or later.
Watch yourself, Rain Man!
What do you think?
Perfect!
What?
Why don't you just talk to Terry?
I know he likes you.
It's not that easy.
It was all right for you to barge in to the bogs and offer me a gob-job!
That was just sex.
It's different with Terry.
I don't know what I feel.
Sometimes it's hard to tell someone what's really going on.
Hey, I've been ringing you.
Right.
Sorry, my phone's been on silent for rehearsals.
Have you finished?
We've only just started.
I've got a job.
You gonna be all right?
I can't take her with me.
It's too dangerous.
She can be the baby Jesus.
My only concern now is getting a crowd in to see it ...
an audience, you know.
I mean, who's going to want to come and see this lot do the Nativity when it's not even Christmas?
Why can't it be Christmas?
Tills are always bursting.
I love Christmas!
I'm sorry!
You all right?
I've twisted me knee!
It needs support.
I need a bandage.
I'm sorry!
Will it be OK?
"It hasn't got an alarm."
But instead, it's got a private security company with a direct link to the filth.
Perfect!
They'll send me down for this!
Grow up.
I can't go to prison.
I'm too young!
We'll get our brief on to it, be away on some technicality.
Don't worry!
What if we don't?
I'll pack you some lube.
Pretty boy like you.
Dozy bastard.
We should've gone back to the car.
He would have seen us.
Ring Shane or someone.
Ask them to pick us up.
Where's your phone?
In the car.
Where's your phone?
In the car.
Fuck!
What are we gonna do?
I dunno.
Paddy'd know what to do.
He would.
One clever fuck that one, great under pressure ... always thinking on his feet, you know.
Well, that's the answer!
Do a fucking seance and ask Paddy what to do!
Sorry.
Nah, I'm sorry.
Right, we can't get a cab, we can't hitch a lift, not with these, so...
We'll walk.
We can't, it's too risky.
Filth are looking for us.
We need somewhere to lay low till morning.
We shouldn't be doing this.
It's a church.
Hardly.
It's one of God's houses.
Hasn't paid his council tax by looks of it.
That's blasphemous!
What, it's all right to break into offices and nick stuff, but it's not all right to walk into an unlocked church?
!
I've got morals.
Doesn't look like it's in use now anyway.
Come on.
What are you doing?
Looking.
For what?
A saw or something to get these off.
Yeah, always get a saw in a church.
Drink this.
It's the blood of Christ.
This is his body...
This is his saw.
What then?
Since you think you're the brains of the outfit!
I am the brains of the outfit!
What am I then?
A piece of meat?
A fuck machine?
!
Have a bit of respect.
Swearing in a place of worship!
I don't give a shit.
Hang on...
Thank you, God.
Copper chopper.
Pigs will fly.
Come on, hurry up!
I'm going as fast as I can.
We'll be here forever!
It'd go quicker if I sawed through your wrist.
You're going to hell, you.
What, and you're not?
I pray, I repent, I go to confession.
I don't get why you believe in all that shit.
After everything I've been through?
I have to believe my dead children are in a better place, because if I thought this was it, that life was just this, with nothing at the end... then I'd just give up.
Maybe you need to start looking at "this"
a bit differently.
That was then.
This is now.
You, me and Cilla.
Kinda liked having you by me side.
Maybe we should make it more permanent.
You having a laugh?
No.
Will you marry me?
Everyone all right?
How are you doing?
Nervous?
I've still not had a shag!
Who the fuck are you supposed to be?
Inn keeper.
I've still not shagged a woman yet.
What's with all the blue paint?
I get it, it's fucking Avatar, in't it?
Avatar inn keeper!
But there's...
Never mind.
Terry, I wanted a word with you about the last scene.
I know we've not rehearsed it, but Joseph should kiss Mary at the end.
It's Lise's idea.
But in the Bible Mary and Joseph don't kiss.
But it doesn't say they didn't either.
They probably did a lot more besides kissing.
You're up the duff and it's not your husbands, you'll have to do more than kissing to make him sweet, aren't you?
You know what I mean.
Think about it.
Mary's giving Joseph a blow-job?
Well, no!
Not in our play.
Maybe after, who knows?
But just a kiss for now?
Never mind.
Lise?
I've just had a chat with Terry and he's come up with this great idea that Mary and Joseph kiss at the end.
All his idea.
Like a dream.
Call an ambulance!
He's passed out.
It must've been the paint!
Don't worry Mickey, leave him to us.
Fucking hell, Ches.
Come on.
You'll need a new inn keeper now, Mickey.
He's not gonna be up to doing the show.
What are you gonna do?
Michael Maguire?
Depends.
We spoke earlier...
I'm from the council.
Brilliant!
Innit?
Yeah...
Great!
We're so chuffed you could come, you'll see what this group have done and maybe bung 'em some cash to get their own centre.
I'm the Health and Safety Executive.
There'll be no performance on these premises.
The set has to be fire-proofed, there are no fire exit signs displayed, a risk of overcrowding.
But this lot have got a performance in less than an hour!
Well, you have to cancel.
Notification of intention to prosecute if you fail to abide.
Cancel.
That's that then.
No stage, no inn keeper... no show.
I've not worked my bollocks off for nothing.
We are doing it.
Bugger off, can't you see it's the second coming?
Stupid, what are you doing?
Hey!
Hey!
All of the hotels, and the pubs are all full.
Man United must be playing!
This is the last inn for miles.
Hello.
My wife is with child.
We need a bed for the night.
Do you have room at your inn?
