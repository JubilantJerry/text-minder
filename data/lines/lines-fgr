They look like red curtains about to open onto life.
The voice you hear is not my speaking voice.
But my mind's voice.
I have not spoken since I was 6 years old.
No one knows why.
Not even me.
The Piano is the only film directed by a woman to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival.
The majority of, and the highest paid, screenwriters in early Hollywood were women, but then filmmaking became more male.
Women make up about 50% of the whole world, but there's only about 3% of women who are directors or are actually probably selecting content.
And, you know, it just seems to me really sad that...
Because women's, I think, interests are a lot more, a lot different than male interests in large, you know, they're, I think, they're a lot more nurturing.
They're much more orientated to connection.
And male interests are much more interested in, sort of, building, identifying their, sort of, blustering egos or whatever.
Bombing things, blowing things up, being strong men, Spiderman or whatever, you know?
Which I don't think women do and I think, you know, what's important is to try and not change the guys.
I mean, I think it's fun what they do but to, sort of, get the balance, you know, have what women do.
But because most of the men run the business I think that's...
They understand or identify much better with what the male interests.
But the audience is actually probably more identifiably female.
Sometimes one of the great betrayals of the female is that they want to see themselves through male eyes.
So they're very interested in what men do too.
If Jane Campion was the Ingmar Bergman of Australasian cinema, making films about intense human psychology, this man, Baz Luhrmann was its flamboyant Vincent Minnelli.
Campion's films could have been made in the 1920s but Luhrmann's bring us carousing back into the postmodern '90s.
Baz Luhrmann defined the first days of digital.
Like the man himself, his films are a meteor shower of references to everything from Shakespeare to Bollywood.
Shakespeare and Bollywood cinema had something in common and what they had in common was the blindness to taste or style or any of those imposed...
Posed ideals about art.
What they were singularly focused on was the engagement of as many human beings as possible, from as many types of humanity, to be moved and touched by story.
To deliver a big idea, a big idea through an emotional experience.
Luhrmann used these all-encompassing ideas about emotion and art, what he called participatory cinema, to make one of the key films of the '90s, his hyperactive version of Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet."
Captions, fireworks, splintered edits, flash forwards, choirs.
A dog of the house of Capulet!
Shakespeare starts "Romeo and Juliet' with very broad, high comedy.
You know?
Standup routine, really.
You know?
Almost addressed to camera.
You know?
But it had to be broad, it had to be fun, it had to be standup.
Right?
To engage the audience, to disarm all of them, before he suddenly goes:
Enter the romantic lead.
Romeo.
Leonardo DiCaprio, back lit, at sunrise, long lens.
In the text the boys meet in the town square.
We're now transporting "Romeo and Juliet"
to a contemporary world that is Miami life, where religion and politics are mixed up with each other.
There is no town square in an American contemporary city.
But there is a gas station.
Because everybody, they don't ride horses, they drive in trucks and cars.
Where do those cars meet?
At the gas station.
Where is the town square?
The gas station.
What if we ironically quote the world of cinema?
What if it is like a Sergio Leone, you know, piece of cinema?
And what if it's like a western?
Right?
That would be a good way of doing that.
Sergio Leone shootout meets the town square gas station in high comedy style.
Whether you think we've done it well or not, if you look at that sequence I think you can see that that set of choices has at least led to that result.
Whether you agree with it or not, that's how we got there.
I will bite my thumb at them which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Shakespeare's exact comic dialogue.
But his swords are guns here.
And knights have become street kids in Hawaiian shirts.
I do bite my thumb, sir.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Is the law of our side, if I say aye?
No.
No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I bite my thumb, sir.
Do you quarrel, sir?
Quarrel, sir!
No, sir.
But if you do, sir, I am for you:
I serve as good a man as you.
No better?
A Sergio Leone gunfight shot in close-up.
A track in.
Draw, if you be men!
Part, fools!
You know not what you do.
A Leone widescreen composition and the pan pipe music from his films.
One of Luhrmann's biggest challenges in the film was how to stage, in an innovative way, the famous scene where Romeo and Juliet meet for the first time.
The audience know this is going to happen.
How can it happen a way in which their delicious expectation and enjoyment of, "it's going to happen,"
can be suspended so that, when it happens, it's a surprise that they knew was going to happen.
It was so perplexing.
We were in Miami and this is, I suppose, the spontaneous, artistic, creative bit of it.
That night we went out to dinner and there was a nightclub.
What happened was I went to the bathroom.
And I was thinking about the problem.
I go into the bathroom, I'm thinking about the problem, and as I am down washing my hands I look up and can see a girl's hair.
And I look and I think, "this is the most brilliant thing."
It's the anti-chamber of the girl's bathroom.
And after you come out of the bathroom, like I was, you wash your hands, you comb your hair and there's a fish tank dividing the boy and the girl's anti-chamber.
And it was as simple as going:
"That's it!
That's the moment."
And that's where it came from.
So it was a combination of extremely academic work, followed by methodology, just work, labor, process, and
I think maybe being open to the world around us, and luck.
So that's how it happened, that was that one.
Luhrmann's "Moulin Rouge" took his ideas about innovative cinema even further.
At the start of the film, the camera sweeps through model and computer generated shots of the gray, dank alleyways of Paris, and then swoops up to the garret of a poet.
His face tear stained because he has loved and lost a beautiful courtesan.
Then we flash back to the famous nightclub, the Moulin Rouge, where the love story took place.
It's a frenzied, red, Luhrmann world of wild postmodern song, and love, and space.
At one point the girls sing "voulez-vous couchez avec moi?"
from LaBelle's Lady Marmalade whilst the men crash into the chorus of nirvana's, "Smells like teen spirit."
No-one in the world was mashing up Sergio Leone, MTV, Hispanic telenovelas, fashion, cross-dressing, and the kaleidoscopic cinema of '90s Hong Kong with such aplomb.
Reality had lost its realness in Bazland.
The very definition of the first days of digital.
Luhrmann called Strictly Ballroom, Romeo + Juliet, and Moulin Rouge the red curtain trilogy.
To make them he set himself rules, a kind of manifesto, that were almost the opposite of Lars Von Trier's dogma rules, the other great '90s movie manifesto.
The first of Luhrmann's rules was that we need to know the story upfront.
You get the feeling...
I mean, "Moulin Rouge" opens, I think, with the opening line, it's something like,
"the woman I loved is dead.
She was the star of the Moulin Rouge."
"Romeo + Juliet" opens with something like,
"doth with their death bury their parents strife."
You are told right up front that the lovers or a lover is going to die.
And by the way, a recent epic, sort of, participatory cinematic work in the beginning called, "Titanic," it's pretty clear in the beginning one of them's going to end up below the waters.
So, you...
That's one rule:
You know where it's going to conclude.
Two, in this red curtain trilogy, to keep the audience alive and, by the way, it's kind of after the fact.
I say you've got to have a device, right?
A distancing device.
But really, why would you do a musical without music?
But essentially there's got to be something that keeps the whole cinematic experience heightened.
So you don't fall into, ever, a feeling that it's somehow "keyhole."
That's it's psychological.
You know?
In the case of "Strictly Ballroom," you know?
Even dramatic scenes are danced out, you know?
"Wes, come here!" You know?
It's dance.
And "Romeo + Juliet" it's the language, you know?
"Do you bite your thumb at me, sir?"
And then "Moulin Rouge," of course, it's song, it's music.
?
I was made ?
?
for loving you, baby ?
?
you were made for loving me ?
?
the only way of lovin' me ?
?
baby, is to pay a lovely fee ?
?
just one night ?
?
just one night ?
?
there's no way ?
?
'cause you can't pay ?
?
in the name of love ?
?
one night ?
?
in the name of love ?
Visually this is pure romantic cinema:
moonlight, a rooftop tryst, reverse angle editing, two shots.
But the music is a wild '90s mash up of pop songs, used almost like dialogue, as if reality had been remixed by a DJ.
?
Don't leave me this way ?
?
you think that people ?
?
would have had enough ?
?
of silly love songs ?
?
I look around me ?
?
and I see it isn't so ?
In this participatory cinema, in particular, say, a musical, you need to know where it's heading and you need the story to be extremely linear.
One thing happens precisely after the other, like math, so that you can save time, so that you can take the human moment,
"oh, I love you, I love you, I love you," which in a psychological scene might be,
"you know, I really love you."
And music, and the expression of that could take an extra 3 minutes.
And we could expand the emotional experience of that beyond the reality in life.
And that's where the romanticism comes in is that we're making something that happens in life, better than it is in life.
Bigger than it is in life.
Better and bigger than life.
Exactly what many movie makers aimed for in the last days of digital at the end of the old millennium.
The story of film was full of the fizz and feedback of those days, and the rapture of self-loss.
But then came the 21st century.

Previously on "The Event"...
Sophia, she's bringing all of our people here.
It means genocide for humans.
They're looking for some kind of weapon.
You need to get word out.
We have to stop her.
Ugh!
Give me the phone!
- Sean.
- Leila?
Someone outside of our group might be able to stop Sophia.
That someone is you.
As long as I'm alive,
I'm gonna do whatever it takes to stop you.
I would expect no less.
We will find you...
And we will punish you for what you have done.
It was Martinez's actions that escalated the conflict.
You and me working together?
What exactly are you talking about?
Martinez won't listen to reason, not from you, not from anyone.
So we are left with a more permanent solution.
It will be clean...
untraceable.
Follow my instructions, and by this time tomorrow, you'll be leader of the free world.
Good morning, Mr. President.
Halt!
Everybody out.
Open it.
- Morning, vice.
- General.
Good morning, Mr. President.
Good morning, everyone.
Uh, all right, looks like we have a full plate here.
Let's get started.
Coffee, sir?
Please.
We've established a task force to look into the evidence left behind by Herbert Mills, the sleeper who committed suicide.
Do we know any more about what he was doing?
No, not yet.
Unfortunately, all we had to go on was water from melted ice core samples left in an industrial microwave.
I'm aware of that.
Do you know where the ice core samples originated yet?
Analysis revealed microscopic sediments in the water found only in the Northwestern part of Siberia.
Siberia?
What relevance that may have is unclear.
Unclear won't cut it, Blake.
He killed himself so we couldn't find out what he was doing.
This is significant, which, chances are, it'll bring us back to Sophia.
Were there any trace elements in these samples?
Any signs of radioactivity?
No.
Not that we could detect.
Unfortunately, it'll be another 24 to 48 hours before any further testing results can come back.
Can we cut 48 hours down to 24?
I'm sorry, sir, but that's what I'm told.
General, where's NASA stand on this?
I think they're in place.
They're the ones doing the testing, so hopefully, we'll get word.
Okay, so...
I can work with that.
Right.
All right, let's check with the Russian intelligence service, see if we can get any cooperation finding out what might be of interest to Sophia in Northwestern Siberia.
I'll make a discreet inquiry.
Next on the agenda...
H.R. 9036.
Richard, I thought this was a done deal.
How does a slam dunk turn so quickly into a liability the House now wants to kill?
The latest unemployment figures just came out.
Trade agreement, sir...
suddenly not so popular.
There were a few defectors, but I still think we can salvage it.
I want names, specific congressmen I'll have to talk to.
I don't want to go into another vote not knowing...
Let's take five...
Ah...
- Oh!
Mr. President!
- Are you all right,
Mr. President?
Season 1, Episode 18:
Strain
We have the President, 46-year-old male with no significant past medical history.
On arrival, we found him with decreased responsiveness.
He has a G.C.S. of 11.
He's 230 over 110, heart rate 70.
All right, get two large-bore I.V.s.
Elevate the head of his bed.
Call the scanner.
Get him in stat.
I want you to give 20 of labetalol.
Recycle the pressures every five minutes.
Sir, what's your name?
Elias.
Sir, squeeze my hand.
Squeeze with your other hand.
Spoon the ambassador onto the speaker.
I'm sure he'll understand.
Do not cancel anything that does not directly require the President's signature, smile, or person.
It's imperative that the public knows that this government can run while he's down.
- How is he?
- Not good.
The C.T. scan shows bleeding in his brain.
The President has suffered a stroke.
Our main concern right now is controlling the intracranial pressure.
But if we can't control the bleeding by other means, we may have to go in and clip the vessel.
Surgery?
The President had a physical a month ago.
He was in perfect health.
It's an improbable case, statistically and otherwise.
We're doing our best.
If you'll excuse me, I should get back to him.
Of course.
Mr. President.
Blake?
Yes, sir.
Come close.
Is Christina here?
She's on her way, five minutes out.
Oh.
What do the doctors say?
They're cautiously optimistic.
I can barely see you, and I know you're lying.
Whatever happens... you can't let Jarvis ascend to the Presidency.
I know.
Let's take things one step at a time.
He did this, Blake.
How?
Elias.
I saw... in the room, before I went down,
I looked in his eye.
He's behind this.
I don't know how, but that man does not take the oath.
Do you understand?
I understand.
- Blake...
- I understand.
I understand.
- Raymond.
- Christina.
How is he?
We don't know yet, but it's...
but it's bad, Christina.
How did this happen?
He was fine this morning?
Well, strokes like this, they're very unpredictable.
I need to see him.
Is he...
If anyone's gonna make it through this, it's Eli.
He's the strongest, most willful man
I have ever met in my life.
And if he wants to live...
Whatever happens...
I want you to know that that man is a hero to me.
Thank you, Raymond.
Gi... give me a minute.
Blake...
Blake.
We need to talk.
Walk with me.
We need to set a meeting with Jarvis and the heads of the Executive Department.
Why would we do that?
To talk about invoking Section 4.
I think that's premature.
He may not make it, Blake.
Well, I just left his side, and he's still conscious.
For how long?
There's a strict protocol here.
The 25th Amendment clearly states that in the event that the President becomes incapacitated, the cabinet must appoint the V.P. to acting President...
I've read the damn constitution.
Look, we cannot let the Vice President take office.
It's not up to us.
The country needs continuity of leadership.
Jarvis may be responsible for what's happened to the President.
Excuse me?
That's what Martinez just told me.
I'm inclined to believe him.
But he had a stroke.
We were both there.
He thinks Jarvis did something to cause it.
He's experiencing brain trauma.
Clearly, he's not thinking.
You don't know all the facts...
There are things the President and I know about Jarvis, about what he's capable of.
What things?
If you want me to help you, you have to tell me what you know.
This isn't the first time
Jarvis has attempted to eliminate the President.
Obviously, we covered it up, but I know you were made aware of the attempt on the President's life at Coral Gables.
The perpetrators had help from the inside.
- You think Jarvis was involved?
- Oh, I know he was.
He confessed.
You have to help me stop this succession before we end up putting a murderer in the White House.
To take him down, you would need irrefutable proof that he's responsible for the President's condition.
I can get it.
I just need time.
For those of you just tuning in, we are outside Bethesda Hospital, where President Martinez was rushed earlier this morning, uh, for undisclosed reasons.
We have learned from anonymous sources within the White House...
Seems there's reason to celebrate.
Everything's going according to your plan.
Don't.
There's no need to be callous.
I take no joy in seeing this man fall, nor should you.
Aaron reported back from Murmansk.
They've recovered the weapon.
And are we prepared on this end?
We're close.
We'll be ready in time.
Good.
Thank you for letting me know.
Why isn't Michael helping you with this?
I tried calling him.
He hasn't called me back.
Must have gotten held up.
Sophia, once the weapon is in our hands, how are we gonna deliver it on the scale we need?
Once Jarvis is in power, he'll help me.
He just doesn't know it yet.
Sean, they want to take over.
My father's people.
They're looking for some kind of weapon in Siberia near a place called Murmansk.
I also have a woman's name...
Irina Bogdanov.
She may be involved.
I don't know anything else.
I just...
Give me this.
Ah!
Where did you get this?
Leila, talk to me!
I know what Sophia's trying to do!
Who did you call?
What did you tell them?
How could you be a part of this?
I'm part of this because I'm trying to save our people.
I don't know what kind of damage you may have just caused, but if Sophia finds out, I won't be able to protect you.
I don't want your protection.
Who did you call?
Who did you call?
Sean.
What did you tell him?
Leila, this is very important.
- How much did you tell him?
- I told him everything... what you're looking for in Siberia, what Sophia is trying to do and take over...
- She took my phone, Michael!
- No, Luis, it's all right.
She made a call to the outside.
No, no, she was just calling her boyfriend.
She called 911, and when I found out, she attacked me!
No, no, it's okay.
Michael, this is a serious breach.
She could have told them who we are, where we are.
We need to take her to Sophia now.
- That's not necessary.
- Michael...
The government learns of our location, we are as good as dead...
you know that!
Sophia needs to know what happened.
You know that.
I know.
I'm sorry, Michael.
I really am.
But the truth is you should have never brought her here.
Well, there's nothing we can do about it now.
What's done is done.
Grab his legs.
I know we can't trust what Dempsey told us, but I do trust Leila, and she confirmed his story.
If there's even a chance of us stopping Sophia and her people from getting this weapon...
Leila didn't give you anything actionable.
What, the name of some woman?
Irina Bogdanov.
She also told me the weapon was somewhere near Murmansk.
Do you have any idea how cold it is in western Siberia this time of year?
Ten...
think ten degrees.
I'm not freezing my ass off just 'cause some delusional old man thinks the world's coming to an end.
When we came to France, we had even less to go on, didn't we?
And look what we were able to accomplish.
All right.
All right what?
Nonterrestrials, weapons of mass destruction... count me in.
I'll help you.
You will?
Yes.
Why?
Don't try to analyze me, Sean.
Just take "yes" as an answer.
Oh, finally!
- What, you found her?
- Oh, not exactly.
I've been searching passport databases and passenger manifests.
Problem is...
Irina Bogdanov isn't the name of a woman.
"Europol customs port of call declaration. "
It's the name of a ship.
Currently docked at the port of Murmansk.
The subject is surprisingly intact... even after nearly 93 years...
Due, most likely, to the, uh, preservation in the permafrost.
Ready now to expose...
The organs.
The men are worried.
The job has risks that were not fully disclosed.
As long as they stay out of the clean room, your men are perfectly safe.
Money would be more convincing than words.
You don't like the job, then quit.
You're not getting more money.
Now, go get me another pack of smokes.
I'm out.
The lungs are magnificent.
I think we'll have very good results.
His epithelium are enlarged, and the primary bronchi appear to be filled with mucus or... or some kind of liquid.
Oh!
Oh, my God!
Oh...
Oh...
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
I need to get out!
I've cut my suit.
I need you to let me out.
I'm sorry, Doctor.
Please.
Please.
It's gonna be all right.
I know what I'm doing.
Please!
Open the door!
Please!
Open the door.
He started exhibiting intracranial hypertension, and the pressure increased to the point that he lost consciousness.
Once the swelling goes down, will he wake up?
It's possible.
But if cerebral profusion... uh, his circulation is compromised... there is still the risk of ischemia.
- Another stroke.
- Yes, ma'am.
We should know fairly soon if he's responding to the treatment.
I know how difficult this is.
But you should prepare yourself, Mrs. Martinez.
If we don't see a marked improvement in his I.C.P., we will need to discuss his wishes for...
Please.
Mm-mm.
Elias...
I don't know if you can hear me, but I'm right here.
I know you're suffering.
I know how powerless you must feel right now.
Please fight.
I love you.
I love you so much.
I checked Jarvis' movements this morning.
Everywhere he went inside the White House before and after the President's collapse.
Were you able to find anything suspicious?
Yeah, maybe.
He arrived at the morning briefing in the situation room early.
He was there already when the rest of us came in.
Yeah.
I pulled up the surveillance footage from before we got there.
There.
He goes to the coffee cart.
Hey, what's he doing?
It's got to be the coffee.
He must have spiked it in some way.
With some kind of poison, something that would give the President a stroke?
Jarvis knows our morning routine.
He could easily have spiked the President's cup.
Maybe.
But you'll need more than pictures of the Vice President's back to convince anyone of it.
I thought I asked not to be disturbed.
I'm sorry, but it's not for you, Director Sterling.
Mr. Peel... the Vice President is looking for him and says it's urgent.
My apologies for the interruption.
It's not a problem, Mr. Vice President.
How can I help you?
Of all my duties as Vice President, this is the most unenviable one.
But as much as it pains me to do so,
I am bound.
I have notified the President Pro Tem of the Senate and the Speaker of the House that this communication is coming.
It's a written declaration... asking the President's Cabinet to enact
Section 4 of the 25th Amendment... the succession protocol.
I truly wish it wasn't necessary, but it is my responsibility to assure that the continuity of our great democracy be maintained.
"Our great democracy. "
Indeed.
Mr. Peel, would you please gather the Cabinet for the signing of the declaration...
As soon as possible?
The Secretary of State is on her way back from the Middle East.
She cut her trip short.
She'll be landing in a couple of hours.
Well, we'll convene as soon as she gets here.
I just want you both to know that I don't, uh...
I don't feel I'll be able to fill
Elias' shoes.
I only wish I can tread capably in the path he's already set for us.
The Secretary of State...
she's already landed.
I briefed her myself on the President's condition.
I know.
I just bought us a couple of hours.
But that's it.
We either find something on Jarvis now, or that man is gonna be the next President of the United States.
Well, I appreciate your call, but I'll have to call you back.
Mr. Vice President,
I have Prime Minister Wilheim on the phone, and the Russian premier just called before that.
Tell everyone I'm busy.
I don't want to be disturbed.
Yes, Mr. Vice President.
I'm sorry, Mr. Prime Minister.
The Vice President...
- What do you want?
- Mr. Vice President...
I've been watching the news all morning.
Why hasn't Presidential authority been turned over to you yet?
Because the President isn't dead.
I had to petition the Cabinet to appoint me acting President.
Then I had to wait for them to ratify me, none of which would have been necessary had the powder you given me worked.
Just be calm.
The poison's working exactly as it's designed to... taking its toll on the President slowly.
I just want this over.
Just be patient.
In the next few hours,
President Martinez will lapse into a coma.
Shortly after that, he will die.
And you'll be the next President of your country.
- Did you see that?
- What?
Watch the Vice President.
Look what he does with his hand.
He took the President's sweetener packet off the table.
The packet must have contained the poison, so he removed the evidence.
We'll need more than surveillance footage to convince the rest of the President's Cabinet of any wrongdoing.
We need undeniable proof.
When the President dies, they will do an autopsy.
Are you sure they won't be able to detect what really happened?
We're sure.
The poison is designed to metabolize quickly in the system.
Once it does so, there'll be no trace of it left behind.
Well, you better be right, because I'm the one on the line here, not you.
As long as the sweetener packet was removed, there'll be no proof.
We may have a problem.
Why?
What is it?
When the President collapsed, his coffee spilled.
The coffee's laced with poison.
What are you doing?
What do you mean?
We were told to clean the room.
By who?
I was just following orders.
Is there some kind of problem?
Clean up the blood.
Make sure there's nothing outside the house.
We have to run!
We have to get out of here!
We're not going anywhere.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you...
For being on my side.
I'm not.
Leila, you are not one of them.
We're your people now, not Sean, not anyone else.
I know you can't fully accept that right now, but you have to try, because any more calls to the outside, any more attempts on your part to escape will get us both killed.
Now clean up the blood.
We're wasting time.
Michael...
It's Sophia.
Is that you?
Leila.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Is your father here?
Um...
Yeah.
But, uh...
I think he's sleeping.
Wake him up for me.
He said he doesn't want to be disturbed.
Wake him up, or I will.
Why, is something wrong?
I...
Sophia...
Michael.
Sophia.
Dad...
I didn't hear you come down.
Couldn't sleep.
- Is everything okay?
- Can we talk outside?
Sure.
Thank you, Leila.
Yeah.
Have you seen Luis?
No, not since last night.
He's not answering his phone.
Can you track him down for me?
Of course.
Yeah.
Good.
My Russian isn't quite what it used to be, but I'm pretty sure that's our ship.
Security's heavy.
The other piers didn't have any.
Eight guards total, AK-47s... quarter-mile stretch.
Completely surrounded.
On land.
As far as I can see, they don't have anybody in the water.
We can do it.
We just have to wait for them to get out of our eyeline.
What?
Everything you've done up till now has been for money or family.
Why are you here?
Why are you helping me?
Let me ask you a question, Sean.
Why do you think I'm here?
Honestly, I have no idea.
I
- I don't understand you at all.
That's right.
You don't.
Let's move.
Excuse me.
We need your boat.
Where the hell is the crew?
You ready?
Vicky, don't, don't, don't!
I think there's something inside.
What?
What the hell happened to them?
Only one way to find out.
I can't tell how old the uniform is, but he was a soldier.
They cracked his chest open.
Why?
To get to his lungs.
They're missing.
We're not alone.
Don't move!
Tell us what happening?
I don't understand!
Get him up.
- Start talking!
- I wasn't here!
Do you know what they were doing?
We were just hired for the job few days, and that's it.
I don't know anything!
- He's lying.
- Of course he's lying.
- No, I'm not lying!
- Put him inside.
Get the door.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, they said it was the flu...
Spanish flu.
What the hell are you talking about?
Spanish flu killed 50 million people during World War I.
That's where the uniform is from.
- Yes.
- The body?
The soldier was very deep in the ice, and the virus was alive in him.
That's all I know.
That's the weapon.
The lungs are missing!
Where are they?
- Huh?
- I don't know.
- He's wasting our time.
- I don't know.
They must be on the way to the airport with a courier.
What's the courier's name?
Tell me!
All I know...
On the phone, American called him Alex when he was giving him flight information.
Which is what?
What's the flight information?
Flight 38, Air Moscow.
- To where?
- I don't know.
What was the courier's destination?
I don't know what city!
But he's bringing infected tissue to your country.
- Is everyone here?
- Almost, sir.
Shouldn't be long.
Very good.
Where have you been?
I pulled a sample of the carpet from the situation room, had it sent to the FBI lab.
And?
It's useless.
The fibers were too contaminated with the cleaning solution.
I'm sorry, Blake, but I have to begin the proceedings.
They need to know who they're putting into office.
I want to present the evidence to them.
What evidence?
The obscured security footage?
The statements the President made while suffering the effects of a stroke?
If nothing else, it could hold this off long enough for him to recover.
If you go in there with anything less than a smoking gun, you'll look like a lunatic.
Jarvis will sideline you, and he will keep you from ever proving it.
I can't just forget about this.
I'm not asking you to.
But for now, you're gonna have to play along.
If you can't do that, then don't go in that room.
I have been informed that the President's condition continues to deteriorate.
Given that he is incapacitated and unable to discharge the duties of the office, we must proceed.
Pursuant to Section 4 of the 25th Amendment we must achieve a majority vote to officially appoint Raymond Jarvis as acting President.
If there are no objections,

Previously on The Event...
Sophia, she's bringing all of our people here.
It means genocide for humans.
They're looking for some kind of weapon.
You need to get word out.
We have to stop her.
Ugh!
Give me the phone!
- Sean.
- Leila?
Someone outside of our group might be able to stop Sophia.
That someone is you.
As long as I'm alive,
I'm gonna do whatever it takes to stop you.
I would expect no less.
We will find you...
And we will punish you for what you have done.
It was Martinez's actions that escalated the conflict.
You and me working together?
What exactly are you talking about?
Martinez won't listen to reason, not from you, not from anyone.
So we are left with a more permanent solution.
It will be clean...
untraceable.
Follow my instructions, and by this time tomorrow, you'll be leader of the free world.
Good morning, Mr. President.
Halt!
Everybody out.
Open it.
- Morning, vice.
- General.
Good morning, Mr. President.
Good morning, everyone.
Uh, all right, looks like we have a full plate here.
Let's get started.
Coffee, sir?
Please.
We've established a task force to look into the evidence left behind by Herbert Mills, the sleeper who committed suicide.
Do we know any more about what he was doing?
No, not yet.
Unfortunately, all we had to go on was water from melted ice core samples left in an industrial microwave.
I'm aware of that.
Do you know where the ice core samples originated yet?
Analysis revealed microscopic sediments in the water found only in the Northwestern part of Siberia.
Siberia?
What relevance that may have is unclear.
Unclear won't cut it, Blake.
He killed himself so we couldn't find out what he was doing.
This is significant, which, chances are, it'll bring us back to Sophia.
Were there any trace elements in these samples?
Any signs of radioactivity?
No.
Not that we could detect.
Unfortunately, it'll be another 24 to 48 hours before any further testing results can come back.
Can we cut 48 hours down to 24?
I'm sorry, sir, but that's what I'm told.
General, where's NASA stand on this?
I think they're in place.
They're the ones doing the testing, so hopefully, we'll get word.
Okay, so...
I can work with that.
Right.
All right, let's check with the Russian intelligence service, see if we can get any cooperation finding out what might be of interest to Sophia in Northwestern Siberia.
I'll make a discreet inquiry.
Next on the agenda-- H.R. 9036.
Richard, I thought this was a done deal.
How does a slam dunk turn so quickly into a liability the House now wants to kill?
The latest unemployment figures just came out.
Trade agreement, sir-- suddenly not so popular.
There were a few defectors, but I still think we can salvage it.
I want names, specific congressmen I'll have to talk to.
I don't want to go into another vote not knowing...
Let's take five...
Ah...
- Oh!
Mr. President!
- Are you all right,
Mr. President?
♪ The Event 1x18 ♪ Strain Original Air Date on April 25, 2011
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
We have the President, 46-year-old male with no significant past medical history.
On arrival, we found him with decreased responsiveness.
He has a G.C.S. of 11.
He's 230 over 110, heart rate 70.
All right, get two large-bore I.V.s.
Elevate the head of his bed.
Call the scanner.
Get him in stat.
I want you to give 20 of labetalol.
Recycle the pressures every five minutes.
Sir, what's your name?
Elias.
Sir, squeeze my hand.
Squeeze with your other hand.
Spoon the ambassador onto the speaker.
I'm sure he'll understand.
Do not cancel anything that does not directly require the President's signature, smile, or person.
It's imperative that the public knows that this government can run while he's down.
- How is he?
- Not good.
The C.T. scan shows bleeding in his brain.
The President has suffered a stroke.
Our main concern right now is controlling the intracranial pressure.
But if we can't control the bleeding by other means, we may have to go in and clip the vessel.
Surgery?
The President had a physical a month ago.
He was in perfect health.
It's an improbable case, statistically and otherwise.
We're doing our best.
If you'll excuse me, I should get back to him.
Of course.
Mr. President.
Blake?
Yes, sir.
Come close.
Is Christina here?
She's on her way, five minutes out.
Oh.
What do the doctors say?
They're cautiously optimistic.
I can barely see you, and I know you're lying.
Whatever happens... you can't let Jarvis ascend to the Presidency.
I know.
Let's take things one step at a time.
He did this, Blake.
How?
Elias.
I saw... in the room, before I went down,
I looked in his eye.
He's behind this.
I don't know how, but that man does not take the oath.
Do you understand?
I understand.
- Blake...
- I understand.
I understand.
- Raymond.
- Christina.
How is he?
We don't know yet, but it's-- but it's bad, Christina.
How did this happen?
He was fine this morning?
Well, strokes like this, they're very unpredictable.
I need to see him.
Is he--
If anyone's gonna make it through this, it's Eli.
He's the strongest, most willful man
I have ever met in my life.
And if he wants to live...
Whatever happens...
I want you to know that that man is a hero to me.
Thank you, Raymond.
Gi--give me a minute.
Blake...
Blake.
We need to talk.
Walk with me.
We need to set a meeting with Jarvis and the heads of the Executive Department.
Why would we do that?
To talk about invoking Section 4.
I think that's premature.
He may not make it, Blake.
Well, I just left his side, and he's still conscious.
For how long?
There's a strict protocol here.
The 25th Amendment clearly states that in the event that the President becomes incapacitated, the cabinet must appoint the V.P. to acting President--
I've read the damn constitution.
Look, we cannot let the Vice President take office.
It's not up to us.
The country needs continuity of leadership.
Jarvis may be responsible for what's happened to the President.
Excuse me?
That's what Martinez just told me.
I'm inclined to believe him.
But he had a stroke.
We were both there.
He thinks Jarvis did something to cause it.
He's experiencing brain trauma.
Clearly, he's not thinking.
You don't know all the facts...
There are things the President and I know about Jarvis, about what he's capable of.
What things?
If you want me to help you, you have to tell me what you know.
This isn't the first time
Jarvis has attempted to eliminate the President.
Obviously, we covered it up, but I know you were made aware of the attempt on the President's life at Coral Gables.
The perpetrators had help from the inside.
- You think Jarvis was involved?
- Oh, I know he was.
He confessed.
You have to help me stop this succession before we end up putting a murderer in the White House.
To take him down, you would need irrefutable proof that he's responsible for the President's condition.
I can get it.
I just need time.
For those of you just tuning in, we are outside Bethesda Hospital, where President Martinez was rushed earlier this morning, uh, for undisclosed reasons.
We have learned from anonymous sources within the White House...
Seems there's reason to celebrate.
Everything's going according to your plan.
Don't.
There's no need to be callous.
I take no joy in seeing this man fall, nor should you.
Aaron reported back from Murmansk.
They've recovered the weapon.
And are we prepared on this end?
We're close.
We'll be ready in time.
Good.
Thank you for letting me know.
Why isn't Michael helping you with this?
I tried calling him.
He hasn't called me back.
Must have gotten held up.
Sophia, once the weapon is in our hands, how are we gonna deliver it on the scale we need?
Once Jarvis is in power, he'll help me.
He just doesn't know it yet.
Sean, they want to take over.
My father's people.
They're looking for some kind of weapon in Siberia near a place called Murmansk.
I also have a woman's name-- Irina Bogdanov.
She may be involved.
I don't know anything else.
I just--
Give me this.
Ah!
Where did you get this?
Leila, talk to me!
I know what Sophia's trying to do!
Who did you call?
What did you tell them?
How could you be a part of this?
I'm part of this because I'm trying to save our people.
I don't know what kind of damage you may have just caused, but if Sophia finds out, I won't be able to protect you.
I don't want your protection.
Who did you call?
Who did you call?
Sean.
What did you tell him?
Leila, this is very important.
- How much did you tell him?
- I told him everything-- what you're looking for in Siberia, what Sophia is trying to do and take over--
- She took my phone, Michael!
- No, Luis, it's all right.
She made a call to the outside.
No, no, she was just calling her boyfriend.
She called 911, and when I found out, she attacked me!
No, no, it's okay.
Michael, this is a serious breach.
She could have told them who we are, where we are.
We need to take her to Sophia now.
- That's not necessary.
- Michael...
The government learns of our location, we are as good as dead-- you know that!
Sophia needs to know what happened.
You know that.
I know.
I'm sorry, Michael.
I really am.
But the truth is you should have never brought her here.
Well, there's nothing we can do about it now.
What's done is done.
Grab his legs.
I know we can't trust what Dempsey told us, but I do trust Leila, and she confirmed his story.
If there's even a chance of us stopping Sophia and her people from getting this weapon--
Leila didn't give you anything actionable.
What, the name of some woman?
Irina Bogdanov.
She also told me the weapon was somewhere near Murmansk.
Do you have any idea how cold it is in western Siberia this time of year?
Ten-- think ten degrees.
I'm not freezing my ass off just 'cause some delusional old man thinks the world's coming to an end.
When we came to France, we had even less to go on, didn't we?
And look what we were able to accomplish.
All right.
All right what?
Nonterrestrials, weapons of mass destruction-- count me in.
I'll help you.
You will?
Yes.
Why?
Don't try to analyze me, Sean.
Just take "yes" as an answer.
Oh, finally!
- What, you found her?
- Oh, not exactly.
I've been searching passport databases and passenger manifests.
Problem is...
Irina Bogdanov isn't the name of a woman.
"Europol customs port of call declaration."
It's the name of a ship.
Currently docked at the port of Murmansk.
The subject is surprisingly intact... even after nearly 93 years...
Due, most likely, to the, uh, preservation in the permafrost.
Ready now to expose...
The organs.
The men are worried.
The job has risks that were not fully disclosed.
As long as they stay out of the clean room, your men are perfectly safe.
Money would be more convincing than words.
You don't like the job, then quit.
You're not getting more money.
Now, go get me another pack of smokes.
I'm out.
The lungs are magnificent.
I think we'll have very good results.
His epithelium are enlarged, and the primary bronchi appear to be filled with mucus or... or some kind of liquid.
Oh!
Oh, my God!
Oh...
Oh...
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
I need to get out!
I've cut my suit.
I need you to let me out.
I'm sorry, Doctor.
Please.
Please.
It's gonna be all right.
I know what I'm doing.
Please!
Open the door!
Please!
Open the door.
He started exhibiting intracranial hypertension, and the pressure increased to the point that he lost consciousness.
Once the swelling goes down, will he wake up?
It's possible.
But if cerebral profusion-- uh, his circulation is compromised-- there is still the risk of ischemia.
- Another stroke.
- Yes, ma'am.
We should know fairly soon if he's responding to the treatment.
I know how difficult this is.
But you should prepare yourself, Mrs. Martinez.
If we don't see a marked improvement in his I.C.P., we will need to discuss his wishes for--
Please.
Mm-mm.
Elias...
I don't know if you can hear me, but I'm right here.
I know you're suffering.
I know how powerless you must feel right now.
Please fight.
I love you.
I love you so much.
I checked Jarvis' movements this morning.
Everywhere he went inside the White House before and after the President's collapse.
Were you able to find anything suspicious?
Yeah, maybe.
He arrived at the morning briefing in the situation room early.
He was there already when the rest of us came in.
Yeah.
I pulled up the surveillance footage from before we got there.
There.
He goes to the coffee cart.
Hey, what's he doing?
It's got to be the coffee.
He must have spiked it in some way.
With some kind of poison, something that would give the President a stroke?
Jarvis knows our morning routine.
He could easily have spiked the President's cup.
Maybe.
But you'll need more than pictures of the Vice President's back to convince anyone of it.
I thought I asked not to be disturbed.
I'm sorry, but it's not for you, Director Sterling.
Mr. Peel--the Vice President is looking for him and says it's urgent.
My apologies for the interruption.
It's not a problem, Mr. Vice President.
How can I help you?
Of all my duties as Vice President, this is the most unenviable one.
But as much as it pains me to do so,
I am bound.
I have notified the President Pro Tem of the Senate and the Speaker of the House that this communication is coming.
It's a written declaration... asking the President's Cabinet to enact
Section 4 of the 25th Amendment-- the succession protocol.
I truly wish it wasn't necessary, but it is my responsibility to assure that the continuity of our great democracy be maintained.
"Our great democracy."
Indeed.
Mr. Peel, would you please gather the Cabinet for the signing of the declaration...
As soon as possible?
The Secretary of State is on her way back from the Middle East.
She cut her trip short.
She'll be landing in a couple of hours.
Well, we'll convene as soon as she gets here.
I just want you both to know that I don't, uh...
I don't feel I'll be able to fill
Elias' shoes.
I only wish I can tread capably in the path he's already set for us.
The Secretary of State-- she's already landed.
I briefed her myself on the President's condition.
I know.
I just bought us a couple of hours.
But that's it.
We either find something on Jarvis now, or that man is gonna be the next President of the United States.
Well, I appreciate your call, but I'll have to call you back.
Mr. Vice President,
I have Prime Minister Wilheim on the phone, and the Russian premier just called before that.
Tell everyone I'm busy.
I don't want to be disturbed.
Yes, Mr. Vice President.
I'm sorry, Mr. Prime Minister.
The Vice President...
- What do you want?
- Mr. Vice President...
I've been watching the news all morning.
Why hasn't Presidential authority been turned over to you yet?
Because the President isn't dead.
I had to petition the Cabinet to appoint me acting President.
Then I had to wait for them to ratify me, none of which would have been necessary had the powder you given me worked.
Just be calm.
The poison's working exactly as it's designed to-- taking its toll on the President slowly.
I just want this over.
Just be patient.
In the next few hours,
President Martinez will lapse into a coma.
Shortly after that, he will die.
And you'll be the next President of your country.
- Did you see that?
- What?
Watch the Vice President.
Look what he does with his hand.
He took the President's sweetener packet off the table.
The packet must have contained the poison, so he removed the evidence.
We'll need more than surveillance footage to convince the rest of the President's Cabinet of any wrongdoing.
We need undeniable proof.
When the President dies, they will do an autopsy.
Are you sure they won't be able to detect what really happened?
We're sure.
The poison is designed to metabolize quickly in the system.
Once it does so, there'll be no trace of it left behind.
Well, you better be right, because I'm the one on the line here, not you.
As long as the sweetener packet was removed, there'll be no proof.
We may have a problem.
Why?
What is it?
When the President collapsed, his coffee spilled.
The coffee's laced with poison.
What are you doing?
What do you mean?
We were told to clean the room.
By who?
I was just following orders.
Is there some kind of problem?
Clean up the blood.
Make sure there's nothing outside the house.
We have to run!
We have to get out of here!
We're not going anywhere.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you...
For being on my side.
I'm not.
Leila, you are not one of them.
We're your people now, not Sean, not anyone else.
I know you can't fully accept that right now, but you have to try, because any more calls to the outside, any more attempts on your part to escape will get us both killed.
Now clean up the blood.
We're wasting time.
Michael...
It's Sophia.
Is that you?
Leila.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Is your father here?
Um...
Yeah.
But, uh...
I think he's sleeping.
Wake him up for me.
He said he doesn't want to be disturbed.
Wake him up, or I will.
Why, is something wrong?
I--
Sophia--
Michael.
Sophia.
Dad...
I didn't hear you come down.
Couldn't sleep.
- Is everything okay?
- Can we talk outside?
Sure.
Thank you, Leila.
Yeah.
Have you seen Luis?
No, not since last night.
He's not answering his phone.
Can you track him down for me?
Of course.
Yeah.
Good.
My Russian isn't quite what it used to be, but I'm pretty sure that's our ship.
Security's heavy.
The other piers didn't have any.
Eight guards total, AK-47s-- quarter-mile stretch.
Completely surrounded.
On land.
As far as I can see, they don't have anybody in the water.
We can do it.
We just have to wait for them to get out of our eyeline.
What?
Everything you've done up till now has been for money or family.
Why are you here?
Why are you helping me?
Let me ask you a question, Sean.
Why do you think I'm here?
Honestly, I have no idea.
I-I don't understand you at all.
That's right.
You don't.
Let's move.
Excuse me.
We need your boat.
Where the hell is the crew?
You ready?
Vicky, don't, don't, don't!
I think there's something inside.
What?
What the hell happened to them?
Only one way to find out.
I can't tell how old the uniform is, but he was a soldier.
They cracked his chest open.
Why?
To get to his lungs.
They're missing.
We're not alone.

I don't understand!
Get him up.
- Start talking!
- I wasn't here!
Do you know what they were doing?
We were just hired for the job few days, and that's it.
I don't know anything!
- He's lying.
- Of course he's lying.
- No, I'm not lying!
- Put him inside.
Get the door.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, they said it was the flu--
Spanish flu.

The lungs are missing!
Where are they?
- Huh?
- I don't know.
- He's wasting our time.
- I don't know.
They must be on the way to the airport with a courier.
What's the courier's name?
Tell me!
All I know...
On the phone, American called him Alex when he was giving him flight information.
Which is what?
What's the flight information?
Flight 38, Air Moscow.
- To where?
- I don't know.
What was the courier's destination?
I don't know what city!
But he's bringing infected tissue to your country.
- Is everyone here?
- Almost, sir.
Shouldn't be long.
Very good.
Where have you been?
I pulled a sample of the carpet from the situation room, had it sent to the FBI lab.
And?
It's useless.
The fibers were too contaminated with the cleaning solution.
I'm sorry, Blake, but I have to begin the proceedings.
They need to know who they're putting into office.
I want to present the evidence to them.
What evidence?
The obscured security footage?
The statements the President made while suffering the effects of a stroke?
If nothing else, it could hold this off long enough for him to recover.
If you go in there with anything less than a smoking gun, you'll look like a lunatic.
Jarvis will sideline you, and he will keep you from ever proving it.
I can't just forget about this.
I'm not asking you to.
But for now, you're gonna have to play along.
If you can't do that, then don't go in that room.

Unfortunately, it'll be another 24 to 48 hours before any further testing results can come back.
Can we cut 48 hours down to 24?
I'm sorry, sir, but that's what I'm told.
General, where's NASA stand on this?
I think they're in place.
They're the ones doing the testing, so hopefully, we'll get word.
Okay, so...
I can work with that.
Right.
All right, let's check with the Russian intelligence service, see if we can get any cooperation finding out what might be of interest to Sophia in Northwestern Siberia.
I'll make a discreet inquiry.
Next on the agenda-- H.R. 9036.
Richard, I thought this was a done deal.
How does a slam dunk turn so quickly into a liability the House now wants to kill?
The latest unemployment figures just came out.
Trade agreement, sir-- suddenly not so popular.
There were a few defectors, but I still think we can salvage it.
I want names, specific congressmen I'll have to talk to.
I don't want to go into another vote not knowing...

== sync, corrected by elderman ==
We have the President, 46-year-old male with no significant past medical history.
On arrival, we found him with decreased responsiveness.
He has a G.C.S. of 11.
He's 230 over 110, heart rate 70.
All right, get two large-bore I.V.s.
Elevate the head of his bed.
Call the scanner.
Get him in stat.
I want you to give 20 of labetalol.
Recycle the pressures every five minutes.
Sir, what's your name?
[Muffled] Elias.
Sir, squeeze my hand.
Squeeze with your other hand.
Spoon the ambassador onto the speaker.
I'm sure he'll understand.
Do not cancel anything that does not directly require the President's signature, smile, or person.
It's imperative that the public knows that this government can run while he's down.
- How is he?
- Not good.
The C.T. scan shows bleeding in his brain.
The President has suffered a stroke.
Our main concern right now is controlling the intracranial pressure.
But if we can't control the bleeding by other means, we may have to go in and clip the vessel.
Surgery?
The President had a physical a month ago.
He was in perfect health.
It's an improbable case, statistically and otherwise.
We're doing our best.
If you'll excuse me, I should get back to him.
Of course.
[Woman speaking indistinctly on PA]
[Monitor beeping]
Mr. President.
Blake?
Yes, sir.
Come close.
Is Christina here?
She's on her way, five minutes out.
Oh.
What do the doctors say?
They're cautiously optimistic.
I can barely see you, and I know you're lying.
Whatever happens... you can't let Jarvis ascend to the Presidency.
I know.
Let's take things one step at a time.
He did this, Blake.
How?
Elias.
I saw... in the room, before I went down,
I looked in his eye.
He's behind this.
I don't know how, but that man does not take the oath.
Do you understand?
I understand.
- Blake...
- I understand.
I understand.
- Raymond.
- Christina.
- How is he?
- [Stammers]
We don't know yet, but it's-- but it's bad, Christina.
How did this happen?
He was fine this morning?
Well, strokes like this, they're very unpredictable.
I need to see him.
Is he--
If anyone's gonna make it through this, it's Eli.
He's the strongest, most willful man
I have ever met in my life.
And if he wants to live...
Whatever happens...
I want you to know that that man is a hero to me.
Thank you, Raymond.
Gi--give me a minute.
[Coughs]
[Vomiting]
[Clears throat]
[Camera shutters clicking]
Blake...
Blake.
We need to talk.
Walk with me.
We need to set a meeting with Jarvis and the heads of the Executive Department.
Why would we do that?
To talk about invoking Section 4.
I think that's premature.
He may not make it, Blake.
Well, I just left his side, and he's still conscious.
For how long?
There's a strict protocol here.
The 25th Amendment clearly states that in the event that the President becomes incapacitated, the cabinet must appoint the V.P. to acting President--
I've read the damn constitution.
Look, we cannot let the Vice President take office.
It's not up to us.
The country needs continuity of leadership.
Jarvis may be responsible for what's happened to the President.
Excuse me?
That's what Martinez just told me.
I'm inclined to believe him.
But he had a stroke.
We were both there.
He thinks Jarvis did something to cause it.
He's experiencing brain trauma.
Clearly, he's not thinking.
You don't know all the facts...
There are things the President and I know about Jarvis, about what he's capable of.
What things?
If you want me to help you, you have to tell me what you know.
This isn't the first time
Jarvis has attempted to eliminate the President.
Obviously, we covered it up, but I know you were made aware of the attempt on the President's life at Coral Gables.
The perpetrators had help from the inside.
- You think Jarvis was involved?
- Oh, I know he was.
He confessed.
You have to help me stop this succession before we end up putting a murderer in the White House.
To take him down, you would need irrefutable proof that he's responsible for the President's condition.
I can get it.
I just need time.
For those of you just tuning in, we are outside Bethesda Hospital, where President Martinez was rushed earlier this morning, uh, for undisclosed reasons.
We have learned from anonymous sources within the White House...
Seems there's reason to celebrate.
Everything's going according to your plan.
Don't.
There's no need to be callous.
I take no joy in seeing this man fall, nor should you.
Aaron reported back from Murmansk.
They've recovered the weapon.
And are we prepared on this end?
We're close.
We'll be ready in time.
Good.
Thank you for letting me know.
Why isn't Michael helping you with this?
I tried calling him.
He hasn't called me back.
Must have gotten held up.
Sophia, once the weapon is in our hands, how are we gonna deliver it on the scale we need?
Once Jarvis is in power, he'll help me.
He just doesn't know it yet.
Sean, they want to take over.
My father's people.
They're looking for some kind of weapon in Siberia near a place called Murmansk.
I also have a woman's name-- Irina Bogdanov.
She may be involved.
I don't know anything else.
I just--
Give me this.
Ah!
Where did you get this?
Leila, talk to me!
I know what Sophia's trying to do!
Who did you call?
What did you tell them?
How could you be a part of this?
I'm part of this because I'm trying to save our people.
I don't know what kind of damage you may have just caused, but if Sophia finds out, I won't be able to protect you.
I don't want your protection.
Who did you call?
Who did you call?
Sean.
[Breathing heavily]
What did you tell him?
Leila, this is very important.
- How much did you tell him?
- I told him everything-- what you're looking for in Siberia, what Sophia is trying to do and take over--
- She took my phone, Michael!
- No, Luis, it's all right.
She made a call to the outside.
No, no, she was just calling her boyfriend.
She called 911, and when I found out, she attacked me!
No, no, it's okay.
Michael, this is a serious breach.
She could have told them who we are, where we are.
We need to take her to Sophia now.
- That's not necessary.
- Michael...
The government learns of our location, we are as good as dead-- you know that!
[Breathing heavily]
Sophia needs to know what happened.
You know that.
I know.
I'm sorry, Michael.
I really am.
But the truth is you should have never brought her here.
Well, there's nothing we can do about it now.
What's done is done.
Grab his legs.
[Train horn blares]
I know we can't trust what Dempsey told us, but I do trust Leila, and she confirmed his story.
If there's even a chance of us stopping Sophia and her people from getting this weapon--
Leila didn't give you anything actionable.
What, the name of some woman?
Irina Bogdanov.
She also told me the weapon was somewhere near Murmansk.
[Scoffs]
Do you have any idea how cold it is in western Siberia this time of year?
Ten-- think ten degrees.
I'm not freezing my ass off just 'cause some delusional old man thinks the world's coming to an end.
When we came to France, we had even less to go on, didn't we?
And look what we were able to accomplish.
All right.
All right what?
Nonterrestrials, weapons of mass destruction-- count me in.
I'll help you.
You will?
Yes.
Why?
Don't try to analyze me, Sean.
Just take "yes" as an answer.
[Conductor speaking french] [Computer beeps]
Oh, finally!
- What, you found her?
- Oh, not exactly.
I've been searching passport databases and passenger manifests.
Problem is...
Irina Bogdanov isn't the name of a woman.
"Europol customs port of call declaration."
It's the name of a ship.
Currently docked at the port of Murmansk.
[Ship horn blows]
The subject is surprisingly intact... even after nearly 93 years...
Due, most likely, to the, uh, preservation in the permafrost.
Ready now to expose...
The organs.
The men are worried.
The job has risks that were not fully disclosed.
As long as they stay out of the clean room, your men are perfectly safe.
Money would be more convincing than words.
You don't like the job, then quit.
You're not getting more money.
Now, go get me another pack of smokes.
I'm out.
The lungs are magnificent.
I think we'll have very good results.
His epithelium are enlarged, and the primary bronchi appear to be filled with mucus or... or some kind of liquid.
[Ship horn blows]
[Muttering]
Oh!
Oh, my God!
Oh...
Oh...
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
I need to get out!
I've cut my suit.
I need you to let me out.
I'm sorry, Doctor.
Please.
Please.
It's gonna be all right.
I know what I'm doing.
Please!
Open the door!
Please!
[Pounding on door]
Open the door.
[Hinges squeaking]
He started exhibiting intracranial hypertension, and the pressure increased to the point that he lost consciousness.
Once the swelling goes down, will he wake up?
It's possible.
But if cerebral profusion-- uh, his circulation is compromised-- there is still the risk of ischemia.
- Another stroke.
- Yes, ma'am.
We should know fairly soon if he's responding to the treatment.
I know how difficult this is.
But you should prepare yourself, Mrs. Martinez.
If we don't see a marked improvement in his I.C.P., we will need to discuss his wishes for--
Please.
[Sniffles]
Mm-mm.
Elias...
I don't know if you can hear me, but I'm right here.
I know you're suffering.
I know how powerless you must feel right now.
Please fight.
[Whispering] I love you.
I love you so much.
I checked Jarvis' movements this morning.
Everywhere he went inside the White House before and after the President's collapse.
Were you able to find anything suspicious?
Yeah, maybe.
He arrived at the morning briefing in the situation room early.
He was there already when the rest of us came in.
Yeah.
I pulled up the surveillance footage from before we got there.
There.
He goes to the coffee cart.
Hey, what's he doing?
It's got to be the coffee.
He must have spiked it in some way.
With some kind of poison, something that would give the President a stroke?
Jarvis knows our morning routine.
He could easily have spiked the President's cup.
Maybe.
But you'll need more than pictures of the Vice President's back to convince anyone of it.
[Knock at door]
I thought I asked not to be disturbed.
I'm sorry, but it's not for you, Director Sterling.
Mr. Peel--the Vice President is looking for him and says it's urgent.
My apologies for the interruption.
It's not a problem, Mr. Vice President.
How can I help you?
Of all my duties as Vice President, this is the most unenviable one.
But as much as it pains me to do so,
I am bound.
I have notified the President Pro Tem of the Senate and the Speaker of the House that this communication is coming.
It's a written declaration... asking the President's Cabinet to enact
Section 4 of the 25th Amendment-- the succession protocol.
I truly wish it wasn't necessary, but it is my responsibility to assure that the continuity of our great democracy be maintained.
"Our great democracy."
Indeed.
Mr. Peel, would you please gather the Cabinet for the signing of the declaration...
As soon as possible?
The Secretary of State is on her way back from the Middle East.
She cut her trip short.
She'll be landing in a couple of hours.
Well, we'll convene as soon as she gets here.
I just want you both to know that I don't, uh...
I don't feel I'll be able to fill
Elias' shoes.
I only wish I can tread capably in the path he's already set for us.
The Secretary of State-- she's already landed.
I briefed her myself on the President's condition.
I know.
I just bought us a couple of hours.
But that's it.
We either find something on Jarvis now, or that man is gonna be the next President of the United States.
Well, I appreciate your call, but I'll have to call you back.
Mr. Vice President,
I have Prime Minister Wilheim on the phone, and the Russian premier just called before that.
Tell everyone I'm busy.
I don't want to be disturbed.
Yes, Mr. Vice President.
I'm sorry, Mr. Prime Minister.
The Vice President...
[Cell phone ringing]
- What do you want?
- Mr. Vice President...
I've been watching the news all morning.
Why hasn't Presidential authority been turned over to you yet?
Because the President isn't dead.
I had to petition the Cabinet to appoint me acting President.
Then I had to wait for them to ratify me, none of which would have been necessary had the powder you given me worked.
Just be calm.
The poison's working exactly as it's designed to-- taking its toll on the President slowly.
I just want this over.
Just be patient.
In the next few hours,
President Martinez will lapse into a coma.
Shortly after that, he will die.
And you'll be the next President of your country.
- Did you see that?
- What?
[Mouse clicks]
[Mouse clicks] Watch the Vice President.
Look what he does with his hand.
He took the President's sweetener packet off the table.
The packet must have contained the poison, so he removed the evidence.
We'll need more than surveillance footage to convince the rest of the President's Cabinet of any wrongdoing.
We need undeniable proof.
When the President dies, they will do an autopsy.
Are you sure they won't be able to detect what really happened?
We're sure.
The poison is designed to metabolize quickly in the system.
Once it does so, there'll be no trace of it left behind.
Well, you better be right, because I'm the one on the line here, not you.
As long as the sweetener packet was removed, there'll be no proof.
We may have a problem.
Why?
What is it?
When the President collapsed, his coffee spilled.
The coffee's laced with poison.
What are you doing?
What do you mean?
We were told to clean the room.
By who?
I was just following orders.
Is there some kind of problem?
[Vacuum whirring]
[Grunting]
Clean up the blood.
Make sure there's nothing outside the house.
We have to run!
We have to get out of here!
We're not going anywhere.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you...
For being on my side.
I'm not.
Leila, you are not one of them.
We're your people now, not Sean, not anyone else.
I know you can't fully accept that right now, but you have to try, because any more calls to the outside, any more attempts on your part to escape will get us both killed.
Now clean up the blood.
We're wasting time.
[Knock at door]
Michael...
It's Sophia.
Is that you?
[Knock at door]
Leila.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Is your father here?
Um...
Yeah.
But, uh...
I think he's sleeping.
Wake him up for me.
He said he doesn't want to be disturbed.
Wake him up, or I will.
Why, is something wrong?
I--
Sophia--
Michael.
Sophia.
Dad...
I didn't hear you come down.
Couldn't sleep.
- Is everything okay?
- Can we talk outside?
Sure.
Thank you, Leila.
Yeah.
Have you seen Luis?
No, not since last night.
He's not answering his phone.
Can you track him down for me?
Of course.
Yeah.
Good.
My Russian isn't quite what it used to be, but I'm pretty sure that's our ship.
Security's heavy.
The other piers didn't have any.
Eight guards total, AK-47s-- quarter-mile stretch.
[Sighs] Completely surrounded.
On land.
As far as I can see, they don't have anybody in the water.
We can do it.
We just have to wait for them to get out of our eyeline.
What?
Everything you've done up till now has been for money or family.
Why are you here?
Why are you helping me?
Let me ask you a question, Sean.
Why do you think I'm here?
Honestly, I have no idea.
I-I don't understand you at all.
That's right.
You don't.
Let's move.
Excuse me.
We need your boat.
[Ship horn blares]
Where the hell is the crew?
You ready?
Vicky, don't, don't, don't!
I think there's something inside.
What?
What the hell happened to them?
Only one way to find out.
[Gasps]
[Breathing heavily]
I can't tell how old the uniform is, but he was a soldier.
They cracked his chest open.
Why?
To get to his lungs.
They're missing.
[Distant thudding]
We're not alone.
Don't move!
Tell us what happening?
I don't understand!
Get him up.
[Speaking Russian]
- Start talking!
- I wasn't here!
Do you know what they were doing?
We were just hired for the job few days, and that's it.
I don't know anything!
- He's lying.
- Of course he's lying.
- No, I'm not lying!
- Put him inside.
Get the door.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, they said it was the flu--
Spanish flu.
What the hell are you talking about?
Spanish flu killed 50 million people during World War I.
That's where the uniform is from.
- Yes.
- The body?
The soldier was very deep in the ice, and the virus was alive in him.
That's all I know.
That's the weapon.
The lungs are missing!
Where are they?
- Huh?
- I don't know.
- He's wasting our time.
- I don't know.
They must be on the way to the airport with a courier.
What's the courier's name?
Tell me!
All I know...
On the phone, American called him Alex when he was giving him flight information.
Which is what?
What's the flight information?
Flight 38, Air Moscow.
- To where?
- I don't know.
What was the courier's destination?
I don't know what city!
But he's bringing infected tissue to your country.
- Is everyone here?
- Almost, sir.
Shouldn't be long.
Very good.
Where have you been?
I pulled a sample of the carpet from the situation room, had it sent to the FBI lab.
And?
It's useless.
The fibers were too contaminated with the cleaning solution.
I'm sorry, Blake, but I have to begin the proceedings.
They need to know who they're putting into office.
I want to present the evidence to them.
What evidence?
The obscured security footage?
The statements the President made while suffering the effects of a stroke?
If nothing else, it could hold this off long enough for him to recover.
If you go in there with anything less than a smoking gun, you'll look like a lunatic.
Jarvis will sideline you, and he will keep you from ever proving it.
I can't just forget about this.
I'm not asking you to.
But for now, you're gonna have to play along.
If you can't do that, then don't go in that room.
I have been informed that the President's condition continues to deteriorate.
Given that he is incapacitated and unable to discharge the duties of the office, we must proceed.
Pursuant to Section 4 of the 25th Amendment we must achieve a majority vote to officially appoint Raymond Jarvis as acting President.
If there are no objections,
I'll commence the vote.
Secretary of Defense,
Watkins.
Aye.

Sophia, she's bringing all of our people here.
It means genocide for humans.
They're looking for some kind of weapon.
You need to get word out.
We have to stop her.
Ugh!
Give me the phone!
- Sean.
- Leila?
Someone outside of our group might be able to stop Sophia.
That someone is you.
As long as I'm alive,
I'm gonna do whatever it takes to stop you.
I would expect no less.
We will find you...
And we will punish you for what you have done.
It was Martinez's actions that escalated the conflict.
You and me working together?
What exactly are you talking about?
Martinez won't listen to reason, not from you, not from anyone.
So we are left with a more permanent solution.
It will be clean...
untraceable.
Follow my instructions, and by this time tomorrow, you'll be leader of the free world.
Good morning, Mr. President.
Halt!
Everybody out.
Open it.
- Morning, vice.
- General.
Good morning, Mr. President.
Good morning, everyone.
Uh, all right, looks like we have a full plate here.
Let's get started.
Coffee, sir?
Please.
We've established a task force to look into the evidence left behind by Herbert Mills, the sleeper who committed suicide.
Do we know any more about what he was doing?
No, not yet.
Unfortunately, all we had to go on was water from melted ice core samples left in an industrial microwave.
I'm aware of that.
Do you know where the ice core samples originated yet?
Analysis revealed microscopic sediments in the water found only in the Northwestern part of Siberia.
Siberia?
What relevance that may have is unclear.
Unclear won't cut it, Blake.
He killed himself so we couldn't find out what he was doing.
This is significant, which, chances are, it'll bring us back to Sophia.
Were there any trace elements in these samples?
Any signs of radioactivity?
No.
Not that we could detect.
Unfortunately, it'll be another 24 to 48 hours before any further testing results can come back.
Can we cut 48 hours down to 24?
I'm sorry, sir, but that's what I'm told.
General, where's NASA stand on this?
I think they're in place.
They're the ones doing the testing, so hopefully, we'll get word.
Okay, so...
I can work with that.
Right.
All right, let's check with the Russian intelligence service, see if we can get any cooperation finding out what might be of interest to Sophia in Northwestern Siberia.
I'll make a discreet inquiry.
Next on the agenda-- H.R. 9036.
Richard, I thought this was a done deal.
How does a slam dunk turn so quickly into a liability the House now wants to kill?
The latest unemployment figures just came out.
Trade agreement, sir-- suddenly not so popular.
There were a few defectors, but I still think we can salvage it.
I want names, specific congressmen I'll have to talk to.

This isn't the first time
Jarvis has attempted to eliminate the President.
Obviously, we covered it up, but I know you were made aware of the attempt on the President's life at Coral Gables.
The perpetrators had help from the inside.
- You think Jarvis was involved?
- Oh, I know he was.
He confessed.
You have to help me stop this succession before we end up putting a murderer in the White House.
To take him down, you would need irrefutable proof that he's responsible for the President's condition.
I can get it.
I just need time.
For those of you just tuning in, we are outside Bethesda Hospital, where President Martinez was rushed earlier this morning, uh, for undisclosed reasons.
We have learned from anonymous sources within the White House...
Seems there's reason to celebrate.
Everything's going according to your plan.
Don't.
There's no need to be callous.
I take no joy in seeing this man fall, nor should you.
Aaron reported back from Murmansk.
They've recovered the weapon.
And are we prepared on this end?
We're close.
We'll be ready in time.
Good.
Thank you for letting me know.
Why isn't Michael helping you with this?
I tried calling him.
He hasn't called me back.
Must have gotten held up.
Sophia, once the weapon is in our hands, how are we gonna deliver it on the scale we need?
Once Jarvis is in power, he'll help me.
He just doesn't know it yet.
Sean, they want to take over.
My father's people.
They're looking for some kind of weapon in Siberia near a place called Murmansk.
I also have a woman's name-- Irina Bogdanov.
She may be involved.
I don't know anything else.
I just--
Give me this.
Ah!
Where did you get this?
Leila, talk to me!
I know what Sophia's trying to do!
Who did you call?
What did you tell them?
How could you be a part of this?
I'm part of this because I'm trying to save our people.
I don't know what kind of damage you may have just caused, but if Sophia finds out, I won't be able to protect you.
I don't want your protection.
Who did you call?
Who did you call?
Sean.
What did you tell him?
Leila, this is very important.
- How much did you tell him?
- I told him everything-- what you're looking for in Siberia, what Sophia is trying to do and take over--
- She took my phone, Michael!
- No, Luis, it's all right.
She made a call to the outside.
No, no, she was just calling her boyfriend.
She called 911, and when I found out, she attacked me!
No, no, it's okay.
Michael, this is a serious breach.
She could have told them who we are, where we are.
We need to take her to Sophia now.
- That's not necessary.
- Michael...
The government learns of our location, we are as good as dead-- you know that!
Sophia needs to know what happened.
You know that.
I know.
I'm sorry, Michael.
I really am.
But the truth is you should have never brought her here.
Well, there's nothing we can do about it now.
What's done is done.
Grab his legs.
I know we can't trust what Dempsey told us, but I do trust Leila, and she confirmed his story.
If there's even a chance of us stopping Sophia and her people from getting this weapon--
Leila didn't give you anything actionable.
What, the name of some woman?
Irina Bogdanov.
She also told me the weapon was somewhere near Murmansk.
Do you have any idea how cold it is in western Siberia this time of year?
Ten-- think ten degrees.
I'm not freezing my ass off just 'cause some delusional old man thinks the world's coming to an end.
When we came to France, we had even less to go on, didn't we?
And look what we were able to accomplish.
All right.
All right what?
Nonterrestrials, weapons of mass destruction-- count me in.
I'll help you.
You will?
Yes.
Why?
Don't try to analyze me, Sean.
Just take "yes" as an answer.
Oh, finally!
- What, you found her?
- Oh, not exactly.
I've been searching passport databases and passenger manifests.
Problem is...
Irina Bogdanov isn't the name of a woman.
"Europol customs port of call declaration."
It's the name of a ship.
Currently docked at the port of Murmansk.
The subject is surprisingly intact... even after nearly 93 years...
Due, most likely, to the, uh, preservation in the permafrost.
Ready now to expose...
The organs.
The men are worried.
The job has risks that were not fully disclosed.
As long as they stay out of the clean room, your men are perfectly safe.
Money would be more convincing than words.
You don't like the job, then quit.
You're not getting more money.
Now, go get me another pack of smokes.
I'm out.
The lungs are magnificent.
I think we'll have very good results.
His epithelium are enlarged, and the primary bronchi appear to be filled with mucus or... or some kind of liquid.
Oh!
Oh, my God!
Oh...
Oh...
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
I need to get out!
I've cut my suit.
I need you to let me out.
I'm sorry, Doctor.
Please.
Please.
It's gonna be all right.
I know what I'm doing.
Please!
Open the door!
Please!
Open the door.
He started exhibiting intracranial hypertension, and the pressure increased to the point that he lost consciousness.
Once the swelling goes down, will he wake up?
It's possible.
But if cerebral profusion-- uh, his circulation is compromised-- there is still the risk of ischemia.
- Another stroke.
- Yes, ma'am.
We should know fairly soon if he's responding to the treatment.
I know how difficult this is.
But you should prepare yourself, Mrs. Martinez.
If we don't see a marked improvement in his I.C.P., we will need to discuss his wishes for--
Please.
Mm-mm.
Elias...
I don't know if you can hear me, but I'm right here.
I know you're suffering.
I know how powerless you must feel right now.
Please fight.
I love you.
I love you so much.
I checked Jarvis' movements this morning.
Everywhere he went inside the White House before and after the President's collapse.
Were you able to find anything suspicious?
Yeah, maybe.
He arrived at the morning briefing in the situation room early.
He was there already when the rest of us came in.
Yeah.
I pulled up the surveillance footage from before we got there.
There.
He goes to the coffee cart.
Hey, what's he doing?
It's got to be the coffee.
He must have spiked it in some way.
With some kind of poison, something that would give the President a stroke?
Jarvis knows our morning routine.
He could easily have spiked the President's cup.
Maybe.
But you'll need more than pictures of the Vice President's back to convince anyone of it.
I thought I asked not to be disturbed.
I'm sorry, but it's not for you, Director Sterling.
Mr. Peel--the Vice President is looking for him and says it's urgent.
My apologies for the interruption.
It's not a problem, Mr. Vice President.
How can I help you?
Of all my duties as Vice President, this is the most unenviable one.
But as much as it pains me to do so,
I am bound.
I have notified the President Pro Tem of the Senate and the Speaker of the House that this communication is coming.
It's a written declaration... asking the President's Cabinet to enact
Section 4 of the 25th Amendment-- the succession protocol.
I truly wish it wasn't necessary, but it is my responsibility to assure that the continuity of our great democracy be maintained.
"Our great democracy."
Indeed.
Mr. Peel, would you please gather the Cabinet for the signing of the declaration...
As soon as possible?
The Secretary of State is on her way back from the Middle East.
She cut her trip short.
She'll be landing in a couple of hours.
Well, we'll convene as soon as she gets here.
I just want you both to know that I don't, uh...
I don't feel I'll be able to fill
Elias' shoes.
I only wish I can tread capably in the path he's already set for us.
The Secretary of State-- she's already landed.
I briefed her myself on the President's condition.
I know.
I just bought us a couple of hours.
But that's it.
We either find something on Jarvis now, or that man is gonna be the next President of the United States.
Well, I appreciate your call, but I'll have to call you back.
Mr. Vice President,
I have Prime Minister Wilheim on the phone, and the Russian premier just called before that.
Tell everyone I'm busy.
I don't want to be disturbed.
Yes, Mr. Vice President.
I'm sorry, Mr. Prime Minister.
The Vice President...
- What do you want?
- Mr. Vice President...
I've been watching the news all morning.
Why hasn't Presidential authority been turned over to you yet?
Because the President isn't dead.
I had to petition the Cabinet to appoint me acting President.
Then I had to wait for them to ratify me, none of which would have been necessary had the powder you given me worked.
Just be calm.
The poison's working exactly as it's designed to-- taking its toll on the President slowly.
I just want this over.
Just be patient.
In the next few hours,
President Martinez will lapse into a coma.
Shortly after that, he will die.
And you'll be the next President of your country.
- Did you see that?
- What?
Watch the Vice President.
Look what he does with his hand.
He took the President's sweetener packet off the table.
The packet must have contained the poison, so he removed the evidence.
We'll need more than surveillance footage to convince the rest of the President's Cabinet of any wrongdoing.
We need undeniable proof.
When the President dies, they will do an autopsy.
Are you sure they won't be able to detect what really happened?
We're sure.
The poison is designed to metabolize quickly in the system.
Once it does so, there'll be no trace of it left behind.
Well, you better be right, because I'm the one on the line here, not you.
As long as the sweetener packet was removed, there'll be no proof.
We may have a problem.
Why?
What is it?
When the President collapsed, his coffee spilled.
The coffee's laced with poison.
What are you doing?
What do you mean?
We were told to clean the room.
By who?
I was just following orders.
Is there some kind of problem?
Clean up the blood.
Make sure there's nothing outside the house.
We have to run!
We have to get out of here!
We're not going anywhere.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you...
For being on my side.
I'm not.
Leila, you are not one of them.
We're your people now, not Sean, not anyone else.
I know you can't fully accept that right now, but you have to try, because any more calls to the outside, any more attempts on your part to escape will get us both killed.
Now clean up the blood.
We're wasting time.
Michael...
It's Sophia.
Is that you?
Leila.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Is your father here?
Um...
Yeah.
But, uh...
I think he's sleeping.
Wake him up for me.
He said he doesn't want to be disturbed.
Wake him up, or I will.
Why, is something wrong?
I--
Sophia--
Michael.
Sophia.
Dad...
I didn't hear you come down.
Couldn't sleep.
- Is everything okay?
- Can we talk outside?
Sure.
Thank you, Leila.
Yeah.
Have you seen Luis?
No, not since last night.
He's not answering his phone.
Can you track him down for me?
Of course.
Yeah.
Good.
My Russian isn't quite what it used to be, but I'm pretty sure that's our ship.
Security's heavy.
The other piers didn't have any.
Eight guards total, AK-47s-- quarter-mile stretch.
Completely surrounded.
On land.
As far as I can see, they don't have anybody in the water.
We can do it.
We just have to wait for them to get out of our eyeline.
What?
Everything you've done up till now has been for money or family.
Why are you here?
Why are you helping me?
Let me ask you a question, Sean.
Why do you think I'm here?
Honestly, I have no idea.
I-I don't understand you at all.
That's right.
You don't.
Let's move.
Excuse me.
We need your boat.
Where the hell is the crew?
You ready?
Vicky, don't, don't, don't!
I think there's something inside.
What?
What the hell happened to them?
Only one way to find out.
I can't tell how old the uniform is, but he was a soldier.
They cracked his chest open.
Why?
To get to his lungs.
They're missing.
We're not alone.
Don't move!
Tell us what happening?
I don't understand!
Get him up.
- Start talking!
- I wasn't here!
Do you know what they were doing?
We were just hired for the job few days, and that's it.
I don't know anything!
- He's lying.
- Of course he's lying.
- No, I'm not lying!
- Put him inside.
Get the door.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, they said it was the flu--
Spanish flu.
What the hell are you talking about?
Spanish flu killed 50 million people during World War I.
That's where the uniform is from.
- Yes.
- The body?
The soldier was very deep in the ice, and the virus was alive in him.
That's all I know.
That's the weapon.
The lungs are missing!
Where are they?
- Huh?
- I don't know.
- He's wasting our time.
- I don't know.
They must be on the way to the airport with a courier.
What's the courier's name?
Tell me!
All I know...
On the phone, American called him Alex when he was giving him flight information.
Which is what?
What's the flight information?
Flight 38, Air Moscow.
- To where?
- I don't know.
What was the courier's destination?
I don't know what city!
But he's bringing infected tissue to your country.
- Is everyone here?
- Almost, sir.
Shouldn't be long.
Very good.
Where have you been?
I pulled a sample of the carpet from the situation room, had it sent to the FBI lab.
And?
It's useless.
The fibers were too contaminated with the cleaning solution.
I'm sorry, Blake, but I have to begin the proceedings.
They need to know who they're putting into office.
I want to present the evidence to them.
What evidence?
The obscured security footage?
The statements the President made while suffering the effects of a stroke?
If nothing else, it could hold this off long enough for him to recover.
If you go in there with anything less than a smoking gun, you'll look like a lunatic.
Jarvis will sideline you, and he will keep you from ever proving it.
I can't just forget about this.
I'm not asking you to.
But for now, you're gonna have to play along.
If you can't do that, then don't go in that room.
I have been informed that the President's condition continues to deteriorate.
Given that he is incapacitated and unable to discharge the duties of the office, we must proceed.
Pursuant to Section 4 of the 25th Amendment we must achieve a majority vote to officially appoint Raymond Jarvis as acting President.
If there are no objections,
I'll commence the vote.
Secretary of Defense,
Watkins.
Aye.
Secretary of the Treasury,
Sassen.
Aye.
Secretary of the Interior, Wilson.
Aye.
Secretary of State, Carrol.
Aye.
Director of National Intelligence,
Sterling.
Director Sterling.
Aye.
Elias!
Elias!
Help!
Somebody, please help him!
Oh, no!
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Previously on The Event...
Sophia, she's bringing all of our people here.
It means genocide for humans.
They're looking for some kind of weapon.
You need to get word out.
We have to stop her.
Give me the phone, Leila.
Sean.
Leila?
Someone outside of our group might be able to stop Sophia.
That someone is you.
As long as I'm alive, I'm gonna do whatever it takes to stop you.
I would expect no less.
We will find you and we will punish you for what you have done.
It was Martinez's actions that escalated the conflict.
You and me working together?
What exactly are you talking about?
Martinez won't listen to reason.
Not from you, not from anyone.
So we are left with a more permanent solution.
It will be clean.
Untraceable.
Follow my instructions and by this time tomorrow, you'll be leader of the free world.
JARVIS:
Good morning, Mr. President.
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
(ALL SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
AARON:
Everybody out.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Open it.
(BONE SNAPS)
(SHIP CREAKING)
(PHONE RINGING)
Good morning, Mr. Vice President
Good morning, Vice.
General.
(ALL) Good morning, Mr. President.
Good morning, everyone.
AII right.
It looks like we have a full plate here, Iet's get started.
AIDE:
Coffee, sir?
ELIAS:
please.
(HEARTBEAT BEATING)
We've established a task force to look into the evidence left behind by Herbert Mills, the sleeper who committed suicide.
Do we know any more about what he was doing?
No, not yet.
Unfortunately, all we had to go on was water from melted ice core samples
(ECHOING) left in an industrial microwave.
ELIAS: (ECHOING) I'm aware of that.
Do we know where the ice core samples originated from?
The analysis revealed microscopic sediments in the water found only in the north-western part of Siberia.
Siberia?
BLAKE:
What relevance that may have (ECHOING) is unclear.
ELIAS: (ECHOING) "Unclear" won't cut it, Blake.
He killed himself so we couldn't find out what he was doing.
This is significant, which, chances are, will bring us back to Sophia.
Were there any trace elements in these samples?
Any signs of (ECHOING) radioactivity?
STERLING: (ECHOING) No, nothing we could detect.
Unfortunately, it will be another 24 to 48 hours before any further testing results can come back.
Can we cut 48 hours down to 24?
I'm sorry, sir, but that's what I'm told.
General, where does NASA stand on this?
GENERAL:
I think they're in place.
STERLING: (ECHOING) They're the ones doing the testing, so, hopefully, they'll get word.
(ECHOING) Okay, so...
I think I can work with that.
STERLING:
AII right.
Let's check with the Russian intelligence service, see if we can get any cooperation in finding out what might be of interest to Sophia in north-western Siberia.
I'II make a discrete inquiry.
ELIAS:
AII right.
Next on the agenda, H.R. 9036.
Richard, I thought this was a done deal.
How does a slam dunk turn so quickly into a liability that the House now wants to kill?
The latest unemployment figures just came out.
Trade agreements are suddenly not so popular.
There were a few defectors, but I still think we can salvage it.
I want names.
Specific congressmen that I'II have to talk to... (STUTTERING) I don't want to have another vote not knowing... (SLURRING) we have on our side
Let's take five, (SLURRING) beef, soon.
(SLURRING) Finish those five case in...
(GROANS)
(GROANS IN PAIN)
Mr. President!
JARVIS:
Are you all right, Mr. President?
(GASPING AND WHEEZING)
WHITE HOUSE DR.:
We have the President.
Forty-six-year-old male with no significant past medical history.
On arrival, we found him with decreased responsiveness.
He has a GCS of 11.
He is 230/110.
Heart rate 70.
AII right, get two large bore IVs.
elevate the head of his bed, call the scanner and get him in stat.
I want you to give 20 of Labetalol, and recycle the pressures every five minutes.
Sir, what's your name?
EIias...
Sir, squeeze my hand.
Squeeze with your other hand.
Spoon the Ambassador onto the Speaker.
I'm sure he'II understand.
Do not cancel anything that does not directly require the President's signature, smile, or person.
It's imperative that the public knows that this government can run while he's down.
How is he?
Not good.
A CT scan shows bleeding in his brain.
The President has suffered a stroke.
Our main concern right now is controlling the intracranial pressure.
If we can't control the bleeding by other means, we may have to go in and clip the vessel.
Surgery.
The President had a physical a month ago.
He was in perfect health.
It's an improbable case, statistically and otherwise.
We're doing our best.
If you'II excuse me, I should get back to him.
Of course.
(WHISPERING) Mr. President?
blake?
BLAKE:
Yes, sir?
ELIAS:
Come close.
Is Christina here?
She's on her way, five minutes out.
Oh.
What are the doctors saying?
BLAKE:
They're cautiously optimistic.
I can barely see you, and I know you're lying.
Whatever happens, you can't let Jarvis ascend to the Presidency.
Okay, Iet's take things one step at a time...
He did this, blake.
How?
EIias?
I saw him...
In the room, before I went down, I Iooked in his eye.
He's behind this.
I don't know how, but that man does not take the oath, do you understand?
I understand.
blake...
I understand.
I understand.
Raymond.
Christina.
How is he?
Well, we don't know yet.
But it's bad, Christina.
How did this happen?
He was fine this morning.
You know, strokes like this, they're very unpredictable.
I need to see him.
Is he...
Wait.
If anyone's gonna make it through this, it's eli.
He's the strongest, most wilful man I've ever met in my Iife.
And if he wants to live...
Whatever happens,
I want you to know that that man is a hero to me.
Thank you, Raymond.
Give me a minute.
(GAGGING)
(VOMITING AND GASPING)
(PHONE BEEPING)
MAN:
please folks, give him room.
blake?
blake, we need to talk.
Walk with me.
We need to set a meeting with Jarvis and the heads of the Executive Department.
Why would we do that?
To talk about invoking Section 4.
I think that's premature.
He may not make it, blake.
Well, I just left his side and he is still conscious.
But for how long?
There's a strict protocol here.
The 25th Amendment clearly states that in the event that the President becomes incapacitated, the Cabinet must appoint the V.P. to Acting President.
I've read the damn Constitution.
Look, we cannot let the Vice President take office.
It's not up to us.
The country needs continuity of leadership...
Jarvis may be responsible for what has happened to the President.
Excuse me.
That's what Martinez just told me.
And I'm inclined to believe him.
But he had a stroke, we were both there.
He thinks Jarvis did something to cause it.
He's experiencing brain trauma, clearly he is not thinking.
You don't know all the facts.
There are things the President and I know about Jarvis, about what he's capable of...
What things?
If you want me to help you, you have to tell me what you know.
This isn't the first time Jarvis has attempted to eliminate the President.
Obviously, we covered it up,
But I know you were made aware of the attempt on the President's life at Coral Gables.
The perpetrators had help from the inside.
You think Jarvis was involved?
I know he was.
He confessed.
Look, you have to help me stop this succession before we end up putting a murderer in the White House.
To take him down, you would need irrefutable proof that he is responsible for the President's condition.
I can get it.
I just need time.
MALE REPORTER:
For those ofyou just tuning in, we are outside Bethesda Hospital where President Martinez was rushed earlier this morning for undisclosed reasons.
We have learned from anonymous sources within the White House that the President collapsed...
Seems there's reason to celebrate.
Everything's going according to your plan.
Don't.
There's no need to be callous.
I take no joy in seeing this man fall.
Nor should you.
Aaron reported back from Murmansk.
They've recovered the weapon.
And are we prepared on this end?
We're close.
We'II be ready in time.
Good, thank you for letting me know.
Why isn't Michael helping you with this?
I tried calling him, he hasn't called me back.
Must have gotten held up.
Sophia, once the weapon is in our hands, how are we gonna deliver it on the scale we need?
Once Jarvis is in power, he'II help me.
He just doesn't know it yet.
LEILA:
Sean, they want to take over, my father's people.
They're looking for some kind of weapon in Siberia, near a place called Murmansk.
I also have a woman's name, Irina Bogdanov.
She may be involved, I don't know anything else...
I just...
No!
Give this...
Where did you get this?
Leila, talk to me.
I know what Sophia is trying to do.
Who did you call?
What did you tell them?
How could you be a part ofthis?
I'm part ofthis because I'm trying to save our people.
I don't know what kind of damage you may have just caused, but if Sophia finds out, I won't be able to protect you.
I don't want your protection.
Who did you call?
Sean.
What did you tell him?
Leila, this is very important.
How much did you tell him?
I told him everything, what you're looking for in Siberia, what Sophia's trying to do and take over...
LUIS:
She took my phone!
She took my phone!
Luis, it's all right.
She made a call to the outside.
She was just calling her boyfriend.
She called 9-1-1.
And when I found out, she attacked me.
No, no.
It's okay.
Michael, this is a serious breach.
She could've told them who we are, where we are.
We need to take her to Sophia now.
That's not necessary.
No.
Michael, if the government learns of our location we are as good as dead, you know that.
Sophia needs to know what happened.
LUIS:
You know that.
I know.
I'm sorry, Michael, I really am.
But the truth is, you should've never brought her here.
Well, there's nothing we can do about it now.
What's done is done.
Grab his legs.
I know we can't trust what Dempsey told us.
But I do trust Leila, and she confirmed his story.
If there's even a chance of us stopping Sophia and her people from getting this weapon...
Leila didn't give you anything actionable.
What, the name of some woman?
Irina Bogdanov.
She also told me the weapon was somewhere near Murmansk.
Do you have any idea how cold it is in western Siberia this time of year?
Ten.
Think ten degrees.
I'm not freezing my ass off just because some delusional old man thinks the world is coming to an end.
When we came to France, we had even less to go on, didn't we?
And look what we were able to accomplish.
(KEYBOARD CLACKING)
AII right.
AII right, what?
Non-terrestrials, weapons of mass destruction, count me in.
I'II help you.
You will?
Yes.
Why?
Don't try to analyse me, Sean, just take yes as an answer.
(CONDCUTOR SPEAKING FRENCH OVER LOUDSPEAKER)
(COMPUTER BEEPS)
Finally!
What you find her?
Not exactly.
I've been searching passport databases and passenger manifests...
The problem is, Irina Bogdanov isn't the name of a woman.
(KEYBOARD CLACKING) (COMPUTER BEEPS)
"Europol customs, ports of call declaration."
It's the name of a ship.

Hello!
I need to get out.
I cut my suit.
I need you to let me out.
I'm sorry, Doctor.
please.
please.
It's gonna be all right.
I know what I'm doing.
please.
Open the door.
please.
(SOBBING)
Open the door.
He started exhibiting intracranial hypertension, and the pressure increased to the point that he lost consciousness.
Once the swelling goes down, will he wake up?
It's possible.
But if cerebral perfusion, his circulation, is compromised, there's still the risk of ischemia.
Another stroke.
Yes, ma'am.
DR. REED:
We should know fairly soon if he's responding to the treatment.
I know how difficult this is, but you should prepare yourself, Mrs. Martinez.
If we don't see a marked improvement in his ICP, we will need to discuss his wishes for...
please.
Mm-mm.
EIias, I don't know if you can hear me, but I'm right here.
I know you're suffering.
I know how powerless you must feel right now, please fight.
I Iove you so much.
I tracked Jarvis' movements this morning.
Everywhere he went inside the White House before and after the President's collapse.
Were you able to find anything suspicious?
Yeah, maybe.
He arrived to the morning briefing in the Situation Room early.
He was there already when the rest of us came in.
Yeah.
I pulled out the surveillance footage from before we got there.
BLAKE:
He goes to the coffee cart.
(COMPUTER BEEPING) (KEYBOARD CLACKING)
BLAKE:
What's he doing?
It's gotta be the coffee.
He must've spiked it in some way.
With some kind of poison?
Something that would give the President a stroke?
Jarvis knows our morning routine.
He could easily have spiked the President's cup.
Maybe.
But you'II need more than pictures of the Vice President's back to convince anyone of it.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
(DOOR OPENS)
I thought I asked not to be disturbed.
I'm sorry, but it's not for you, Director Sterling.
Mr. Peel, the Vice President is looking for him and says it's urgent.
My apologies for the interruption.
It's not a problem, Mr. Vice President.
How can I help you?
Of all my duties as Vice President, this is the most unenviable one.
But as much as it pains me to do so, I am bound.
I have notified the President Pro Tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House that this communication is coming.
It's a written declaration asking the President's Cabinet to enact Section 4 of the 25th Amendment.
The succession protocol.
I truly wish it wasn't necessary, but it's my responsibility to assure that the continuity of our great democracy be maintained.
Our great democracy.
Indeed.
Mr. Peel, would you please gather the Cabinet for the signing of the Declaration as soon as possible?
The Secretary of State is on her way back from the Middle East.
She cut her trip short.
She will be landing in a couple of hours.
We'II convene as soon as she gets here.
I just want you both to know that I don't...
I don't feel I'II be able to fill EIias' shoes.
I only wish I can tread capably in the path he's already set for us.
The Secretary of State has already landed.
I briefed her myself on the President's condition.
I know.
I just bought us a couple of hours, but that's it.
We either find something on Jarvis now, or that man is gonna be the next President of the United States.
I appreciate your call, but I'II have to call you back.
(PHONE BEEPS)
Mr. Vice President, I have Prime Minister Wilheim on the phone, and the Russian Premier just called before that.
Tell everyone I'm busy.
I don't want to be disturbed.
Yes, Mr. Vice President.
I'm sorry, Mr. Prime Minister, but Vice President Jarvis...
(PHONE RINGING)
What do you want?
Mr. Vice President
I've been watching the news all morning, why hasn't presidential authority been turned over to you yet?
Because the President isn't dead.
I had to petition the Cabinet to appoint me Acting President, then
I had to wait for them to ratify me.
None of which would have been necessary had the powder you'd given me worked.
Just be calm.
The poison is working exactly as it's designed to, taking its toll on the President slowly.
I just want this over.
Just be patient.
In the next few hours, President Martinez will lapse into a coma, shortly after that he will die.
You'II be the next president of your country.
Did you see that?
What?
(MOUSE CLICKING) (COMPUTER BEEPS)
Watch the Vice President, look what he does with his hand.
He took the President's sweetener packet off the table.
The packet must've contained the poison, so he removed the evidence.
We need more than surveillance footage to convince the rest of the President's Cabinet of any wrongdoing.
We need undeniable proof.
When the President dies they will do an autopsy.
Are you sure they won't be able to detect what really happened?
We're sure.
The poison is designed to metabolize quickly in the system.
Once it does, there will be no trace of it left behind.
You better be right because I'm the one on the line here, not you.
As long as the sweetener packet was removed there will be no proof.
We may have a problem.
Why?
What is it?
(MOUSE CLICKING) (COMPUTER BEEPS)
When the President collapsed, his coffee spilled.
(COMPUTER BEEPS)
BLAKE:
Coffee's laced with poison.
What are you doing?
What do you mean?
We were told to clean the room.
By who?
I was jus t following orders.
Is there some kind of problem?
(GRUNTING)
clean up the blood.
Make sure there's nothing outside the house.
We have to run.
We have to get out of here.
We're not going anywhere.
I'II take care of it.
Thank you for being on my side.
I'm not.
Leila, you're not one of them.
We're your people now.
Not Sean, not anyone else.
I know you can't fully accept that right now, but you have to try because any more calls to the outside, any more attempts on your part to escape will get us both killed.
Now, clean up the blood.
We're wasting time.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Michael, it's Sophia.
Is that you?
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Leila?
Hi.
Hello.
Is your father here?
Um.
Yeah, but uh...
Yeah, but, I think he's sleeping.
Wake him up for me.
He said he doesn't want to be disturbed.
Wake him up or I will.
Why?
Is there something wrong?
Sophia...
Michael.
Sophia?
Dad.
I didn't hear you come down.
Couldn't sleep.
Is everything okay?
Can we talk outside?
Sure.
Thank you, Leila.
Yeah.
Have you seen Luis?
No, not since last night.
He's not answering his phone.
Can you track him down for me?
Of course.
Yeah.
Good.
(WORKERS SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
My Russian isn't quite what it used to be, but I'm pretty sure that's our ship.
Security is heavy.
The other piers didn't have any.
VICKY:
Eight guards total, AK-47s, quarter mile stretch.
SEAN:
Completely surrounded.
VICKY:
On land.
As far as I can see they don't have anybody in the water.
(SHUSHING)
We can do it.
We just have to wait for them to get out of our eye line.
What?
Everything you've done up till now has been for money or family.
Why are you here?
Why are you helping me?
Let me ask you a question, Sean.
Why do you think I'm here?
Honestly, I have no idea.
I don't understand you at all.
That's right, you don't.
Let's move.
Excuse me, we need your boat.
(MEN SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
Where the hell is the crew?
You ready?
Vicky, don't, don't, don't.
I think there's something inside.
What?
What the hell happened to them?
Only one way to find out.
(SHIP CREAKING)
(HEAVY BREATHING)
(DOOR CREAKING OPEN)
I can't tell how old the uniform is, but he was a soldier.
They cracked his chest open.
Why?
To get to his lungs, they're missing.
(LOUD CLANGING)
We're not alone.
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
Don't move.
Tell us what's happened?
What happened?
I don't understand.
Get him up.
Start talking.
I wasn't here.
But you know what they were doing.
We were just hired for this job a few days and that's it.
I don't know anything.
He's lying.
Of course he's lying.
No, I'm not lying.
Put him inside.
Get the door.
No, no, no!
No!
They said it was the flu.
Spanish flu.
What the hell are you talking about?
The Spanish flu killed 50 million people during World War I.
That's where the uniform is from.
Yes.
The soldier was buried deep in the ice and the virus was alive in him.
DIMITRI:
That's all I know.
That's the weapon.
The lungs are missing.
Where are they?
I don't know.
He's wasting our time.
No.
They must be on the way to the airport, with a courier.
What's the courier's name?
Tell me!
AII I know, on the phone, American called him alex when he was giving him the flight information.
Which is what?
What's the flight information?
flight 38, Air Moscow.
To where?
I don't know.
What was the courier's destination?
I don't know what city.
But he's bringing infected tissue to your country.
Is everyone here?
almost, sir.
Shouldn't be long.
Very good.
Where have you been?
I pulled a sample of the carpet from the Situation Room, had it sent to the FBI lab.
And?
It's useless.
The fibers were too contaminated with the cleaning solution.
I'm sorry, blake, but I have to begin the proceedings.
They need to know who they're putting into office.
I want to present the evidence to them.
What evidence?
The obscure security footage?
The statements the President made while suffering the effects of a stroke?
If nothing else it could hold this off
long enough for him to recover.
If you go in there with anything less than a smoking gun, you'II look like a lunatic.
Jarvis will sideline you, and he'II keep you from ever proving it.
I can't just forget about it.
I'm not asking you to, but for now you're gonna have to play along.
If you can't do that, then don't go in that room.
(ALL CLAMORING)
I've been informed that the President's condition continues to deteriorate.
Given that he is incapacitated and unable to discharge the duties of the office we must proceed.
Pursuant to Section 4 of the 25th Amendment, we must achieve a majority vote
to officially appoint Raymond Jarvis as Acting President.
If there are no objections, I'II commence the vote.
Secretary of Defence, Watkins.
WATKINS:
Aye.
PEEL:
Secretary of the Treasury, Sasen.
SASEN:
Aye.
PEEL:
Secretary of the Interior, Wilson.
Aye.
Secretary of State, Carol.
Aye.
Director of National Intelligence, Sterling.
Director Sterling.
Aye.

(CRYING)
Previously on The Event...
Sophia, she's bringing all of our people here.
It means genocide for humans.
They're looking for some kind of weapon.
You need to get word out.
We have to stop her.
Ugh!
Give me the phone!
[Objects clattering]
- Sean.
- Leila?
Someone outside of our group might be able to stop Sophia.
That someone is you.
As long as I'm alive,
I'm gonna do whatever it takes to stop you.
I would expect no less.
[Gunshot]
We will find you...
And we will punish you for what you have done.
It was Martinez's actions that escalated the conflict.
You and me working together?
What exactly are you talking about?
Martinez won't listen to reason, not from you, not from anyone.
So we are left with a more permanent solution.
It will be clean...
untraceable.
Follow my instructions, and by this time tomorrow, you'll be leader of the free world.
Good morning, Mr. President.
[Speaking Russian]
[Man shouting in Russian]
Halt!
[Thud]
Everybody out.
Open it.
[Clunk, air hissing]
[Cracking]
[Snap]
- Morning, vice.
- General.
All:
Good morning, Mr. President.
Good morning, everyone.
Uh, all right, looks like we have a full plate here.
Let's get started.
Coffee, sir?
Please.
We've established a task force to look into the evidence left behind by Herbert Mills, the sleeper who committed suicide.
Do we know any more about what he was doing?
No, not yet.
Unfortunately, all we had to go on was water from melted ice core samples left in an industrial microwave.
I'm aware of that.
Do you know where the ice core samples originated yet?
Analysis revealed microscopic sediments in the water found only in the Northwestern part of Siberia.
Siberia?
What relevance that may have is unclear.
Unclear won't cut it, Blake.
He killed himself so we couldn't find out what he was doing.
This is significant, which, chances are, it'll bring us back to Sophia.
Were there any trace elements in these samples?
Any signs of radioactivity?
No.
Not that we could detect.
Unfortunately, it'll be another 24 to 48 hours before any further testing results can come back.
Can we cut 48 hours down to 24?
I'm sorry, sir, but that's what I'm told.
General, where's NASA stand on this?
I think they're in place.
They're the ones doing the testing, so hopefully, we'll get word.
Okay, so...
I can work with that.
Right.
All right, let's check with the Russian intelligence service, see if we can get any cooperation finding out what might be of interest to Sophia in Northwestern Siberia.
I'll make a discreet inquiry.
Next on the agenda-- H.R. 9036.
Richard, I thought this was a done deal.
How does a slam dunk turn so quickly into a liability the House now wants to kill?
The latest unemployment figures just came out.
Trade agreement, sir-- suddenly not so popular.
There were a few defectors, but I still think we can salvage it.
I want names, specific congressmen I'll have to talk to.
I don't want to go into another vote not knowing...
[Slurring]
Let's take five...
[Speaking gibberish]
[Speaking gibberish]
Ah...
[Groans]
- Oh!
Mr. President!
- Are you all right,
Mr. President?

[Suspenseful music]
♪ The Event 1x18 ♪ Strain Original Air Date on April 25, 2011
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
We have the President, 46-year-old male with no significant past medical history.
On arrival, we found him with decreased responsiveness.
He has a G.C.S. of 11.
He's 230 over 110, heart rate 70.
All right, get two large-bore I.V.s.
Elevate the head of his bed.
Call the scanner.
Get him in stat.
I want you to give 20 of labetalol.
Recycle the pressures every five minutes.
Sir, what's your name?
[Muffled] Elias.
Sir, squeeze my hand.
Squeeze with your other hand.
Spoon the ambassador onto the speaker.
I'm sure he'll understand.
Do not cancel anything that does not directly require the President's signature, smile, or person.
It's imperative that the public knows that this government can run while he's down.
- How is he?
- Not good.
The C.T. scan shows bleeding in his brain.
The President has suffered a stroke.
Our main concern right now is controlling the intracranial pressure.
But if we can't control the bleeding by other means, we may have to go in and clip the vessel.
Surgery?
The President had a physical a month ago.
He was in perfect health.
It's an improbable case, statistically and otherwise.
We're doing our best.
If you'll excuse me, I should get back to him.
Of course.
[Woman speaking indistinctly on PA]
[Monitor beeping]
Mr. President.
Blake?
Yes, sir.
Come close.
Is Christina here?
She's on her way, five minutes out.
Oh.
What do the doctors say?
They're cautiously optimistic.
I can barely see you, and I know you're lying.
Whatever happens... you can't let Jarvis ascend to the Presidency.
I know.
Let's take things one step at a time.
He did this, Blake.
How?
Elias.
I saw... in the room, before I went down,
I looked in his eye.
He's behind this.
I don't know how, but that man does not take the oath.
Do you understand?
I understand.
- Blake...
- I understand.
I understand.
- Raymond.
- Christina.
- How is he?
- [Stammers]
We don't know yet, but it's-- but it's bad, Christina.
How did this happen?
He was fine this morning?
Well, strokes like this, they're very unpredictable.
I need to see him.
Is he--
If anyone's gonna make it through this, it's Eli.
He's the strongest, most willful man
I have ever met in my life.
And if he wants to live...
Whatever happens...
I want you to know that that man is a hero to me.
Thank you, Raymond.
Gi--give me a minute.
[Coughs]
[Vomiting]
[Clears throat]
[Camera shutters clicking]
Blake...
Blake.
We need to talk.
Walk with me.
We need to set a meeting with Jarvis and the heads of the Executive Department.
Why would we do that?
To talk about invoking Section 4.
I think that's premature.
He may not make it, Blake.
Well, I just left his side, and he's still conscious.
For how long?
There's a strict protocol here.
The 25th Amendment clearly states that in the event that the President becomes incapacitated, the cabinet must appoint the V.P. to acting President--
I've read the damn constitution.
Look, we cannot let the Vice President take office.
It's not up to us.
The country needs continuity of leadership.
Jarvis may be responsible for what's happened to the President.
Excuse me?
That's what Martinez just told me.
I'm inclined to believe him.
But he had a stroke.
We were both there.
He thinks Jarvis did something to cause it.
He's experiencing brain trauma.
Clearly, he's not thinking.
You don't know all the facts...
There are things the President and I know about Jarvis, about what he's capable of.
What things?
If you want me to help you, you have to tell me what you know.
This isn't the first time
Jarvis has attempted to eliminate the President.
Obviously, we covered it up, but I know you were made aware of the attempt on the President's life at Coral Gables.
The perpetrators had help from the inside.
- You think Jarvis was involved?
- Oh, I know he was.
He confessed.
You have to help me stop this succession before we end up putting a murderer in the White House.
To take him down, you would need irrefutable proof that he's responsible for the President's condition.
I can get it.
I just need time.
For those of you just tuning in, we are outside Bethesda Hospital, where President Martinez was rushed earlier this morning, uh, for undisclosed reasons.
We have learned from anonymous sources within the White House...
Seems there's reason to celebrate.
Everything's going according to your plan.
Don't.
There's no need to be callous.
I take no joy in seeing this man fall, nor should you.
Aaron reported back from Murmansk.
They've recovered the weapon.
And are we prepared on this end?
We're close.
We'll be ready in time.
Good.
Thank you for letting me know.
Why isn't Michael helping you with this?
I tried calling him.
He hasn't called me back.
Must have gotten held up.
Sophia, once the weapon is in our hands, how are we gonna deliver it on the scale we need?
Once Jarvis is in power, he'll help me.
He just doesn't know it yet.
Sean, they want to take over.
My father's people.
They're looking for some kind of weapon in Siberia near a place called Murmansk.
I also have a woman's name-- Irina Bogdanov.
She may be involved.
I don't know anything else.
I just--
Give me this.
Ah!
Where did you get this?
Leila, talk to me!
I know what Sophia's trying to do!
Who did you call?
What did you tell them?
How could you be a part of this?
I'm part of this because I'm trying to save our people.
I don't know what kind of damage you may have just caused, but if Sophia finds out, I won't be able to protect you.
I don't want your protection.
Who did you call?
Who did you call?
Sean.
[Breathing heavily]
What did you tell him?
Leila, this is very important.
- How much did you tell him?
- I told him everything-- what you're looking for in Siberia, what Sophia is trying to do and take over--
- She took my phone, Michael!
- No, Luis, it's all right.
She made a call to the outside.
No, no, she was just calling her boyfriend.
She called 911, and when I found out, she attacked me!
No, no, it's okay.
Michael, this is a serious breach.
She could have told them who we are, where we are.
We need to take her to Sophia now.
- That's not necessary.
- Michael...
The government learns of our location, we are as good as dead-- you know that!
[Breathing heavily]
Sophia needs to know what happened.
You know that.
I know.
I'm sorry, Michael.
I really am.
But the truth is you should have never brought her here.
Well, there's nothing we can do about it now.
What's done is done.
Grab his legs.
[Train horn blares]
I know we can't trust what Dempsey told us, but I do trust Leila, and she confirmed his story.
If there's even a chance of us stopping Sophia and her people from getting this weapon--
Leila didn't give you anything actionable.
What, the name of some woman?
Irina Bogdanov.
She also told me the weapon was somewhere near Murmansk.
[Scoffs]
Do you have any idea how cold it is in western Siberia this time of year?
Ten-- think ten degrees.
I'm not freezing my ass off just 'cause some delusional old man thinks the world's coming to an end.
When we came to France, we had even less to go on, didn't we?
And look what we were able to accomplish.
All right.
All right what?
Nonterrestrials, weapons of mass destruction-- count me in.
I'll help you.
You will?
Yes.
Why?
Don't try to analyze me, Sean.
Just take "yes" as an answer.
[Conductor speaking french] [Computer beeps]
Oh, finally!
- What, you found her?
- Oh, not exactly.
I've been searching passport databases and passenger manifests.
Problem is...
Irina Bogdanov isn't the name of a woman.
"Europol customs port of call declaration."
It's the name of a ship.
Currently docked at the port of Murmansk.
[Ship horn blows]
The subject is surprisingly intact... even after nearly 93 years...
Due, most likely, to the, uh, preservation in the permafrost.
Ready now to expose...
The organs.
The men are worried.
The job has risks that were not fully disclosed.
As long as they stay out of the clean room, your men are perfectly safe.
Money would be more convincing than words.
You don't like the job, then quit.
You're not getting more money.
Now, go get me another pack of smokes.
I'm out.
The lungs are magnificent.
I think we'll have very good results.
His epithelium are enlarged, and the primary bronchi appear to be filled with mucus or... or some kind of liquid.
[Ship horn blows]
[Muttering]
Oh!
Oh, my God!
Oh...
Oh...
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
I need to get out!
I've cut my suit.
I need you to let me out.
I'm sorry, Doctor.
Please.
Please.
It's gonna be all right.
I know what I'm doing.
Please!
Open the door!
Please!
[Pounding on door]
Open the door.
[Hinges squeaking]
He started exhibiting intracranial hypertension, and the pressure increased to the point that he lost consciousness.
Once the swelling goes down, will he wake up?
It's possible.
But if cerebral profusion-- uh, his circulation is compromised-- there is still the risk of ischemia.
- Another stroke.
- Yes, ma'am.
We should know fairly soon if he's responding to the treatment.
I know how difficult this is.
But you should prepare yourself, Mrs. Martinez.
If we don't see a marked improvement in his I.C.P., we will need to discuss his wishes for--
Please.
[Sniffles]
Mm-mm.
Elias...
I don't know if you can hear me, but I'm right here.
I know you're suffering.
I know how powerless you must feel right now.
Please fight.
[Whispering] I love you.
I love you so much.
I checked Jarvis' movements this morning.
Everywhere he went inside the White House before and after the President's collapse.
Were you able to find anything suspicious?
Yeah, maybe.
He arrived at the morning briefing in the situation room early.
He was there already when the rest of us came in.
Yeah.
I pulled up the surveillance footage from before we got there.
There.
He goes to the coffee cart.
Hey, what's he doing?
It's got to be the coffee.
He must have spiked it in some way.
With some kind of poison, something that would give the President a stroke?
Jarvis knows our morning routine.
He could easily have spiked the President's cup.
Maybe.
But you'll need more than pictures of the Vice President's back to convince anyone of it.
[Knock at door]
I thought I asked not to be disturbed.
I'm sorry, but it's not for you, Director Sterling.
Mr. Peel--the Vice President is looking for him and says it's urgent.
My apologies for the interruption.
It's not a problem, Mr. Vice President.
How can I help you?
Of all my duties as Vice President, this is the most unenviable one.
But as much as it pains me to do so,
I am bound.
I have notified the President Pro Tem of the Senate and the Speaker of the House that this communication is coming.
It's a written declaration... asking the President's Cabinet to enact
Section 4 of the 25th Amendment-- the succession protocol.
I truly wish it wasn't necessary, but it is my responsibility to assure that the continuity of our great democracy be maintained.
"Our great democracy."
Indeed.
Mr. Peel, would you please gather the Cabinet for the signing of the declaration...
As soon as possible?
The Secretary of State is on her way back from the Middle East.
She cut her trip short.
She'll be landing in a couple of hours.
Well, we'll convene as soon as she gets here.
I just want you both to know that I don't, uh...
I don't feel I'll be able to fill
Elias' shoes.
I only wish I can tread capably in the path he's already set for us.
The Secretary of State-- she's already landed.
I briefed her myself on the President's condition.
I know.
I just bought us a couple of hours.
But that's it.
We either find something on Jarvis now, or that man is gonna be the next President of the United States.
Well, I appreciate your call, but I'll have to call you back.
Mr. Vice President,
I have Prime Minister Wilheim on the phone, and the Russian premier just called before that.
Tell everyone I'm busy.
I don't want to be disturbed.
Yes, Mr. Vice President.
I'm sorry, Mr. Prime Minister.
The Vice President...
[Cell phone ringing]
- What do you want?
- Mr. Vice President...
I've been watching the news all morning.
Why hasn't Presidential authority been turned over to you yet?
Because the President isn't dead.
I had to petition the Cabinet to appoint me acting President.
Then I had to wait for them to ratify me, none of which would have been necessary had the powder you given me worked.
Just be calm.
The poison's working exactly as it's designed to-- taking its toll on the President slowly.
I just want this over.
Just be patient.
In the next few hours,
President Martinez will lapse into a coma.
Shortly after that, he will die.
And you'll be the next President of your country.
- Did you see that?
- What?
[Mouse clicks]
[Mouse clicks] Watch the Vice President.
Look what he does with his hand.
He took the President's sweetener packet off the table.
The packet must have contained the poison, so he removed the evidence.
We'll need more than surveillance footage to convince the rest of the President's Cabinet of any wrongdoing.
We need undeniable proof.
When the President dies, they will do an autopsy.
Are you sure they won't be able to detect what really happened?
We're sure.
The poison is designed to metabolize quickly in the system.
Once it does so, there'll be no trace of it left behind.
Well, you better be right, because I'm the one on the line here, not you.
As long as the sweetener packet was removed, there'll be no proof.
We may have a problem.
Why?
What is it?
When the President collapsed, his coffee spilled.
The coffee's laced with poison.
What are you doing?
What do you mean?
We were told to clean the room.
By who?
I was just following orders.
Is there some kind of problem?
[Vacuum whirring]
[Grunting]
Clean up the blood.
Make sure there's nothing outside the house.
We have to run!
We have to get out of here!
We're not going anywhere.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you...
For being on my side.
I'm not.
Leila, you are not one of them.
We're your people now, not Sean, not anyone else.
I know you can't fully accept that right now, but you have to try, because any more calls to the outside, any more attempts on your part to escape will get us both killed.
Now clean up the blood.
We're wasting time.
[Knock at door]
Michael...
It's Sophia.
Is that you?
[Knock at door]
Leila.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Is your father here?
Um...
Yeah.
But, uh...
I think he's sleeping.
Wake him up for me.
He said he doesn't want to be disturbed.
Wake him up, or I will.
Why, is something wrong?
I--
Sophia--
Michael.
Sophia.
Dad...
I didn't hear you come down.
Couldn't sleep.
- Is everything okay?
- Can we talk outside?
Sure.
Thank you, Leila.
Yeah.
Have you seen Luis?
No, not since last night.
He's not answering his phone.
Can you track him down for me?
Of course.
Yeah.
Good.
My Russian isn't quite what it used to be, but I'm pretty sure that's our ship.
Security's heavy.
The other piers didn't have any.
Eight guards total, AK-47s-- quarter-mile stretch.
[Sighs] Completely surrounded.
On land.
As far as I can see, they don't have anybody in the water.
We can do it.
We just have to wait for them to get out of our eyeline.
What?
Everything you've done up till now has been for money or family.
Why are you here?
Why are you helping me?
Let me ask you a question, Sean.
Why do you think I'm here?
Honestly, I have no idea.
I-I don't understand you at all.
That's right.
You don't.
Let's move.
Excuse me.
We need your boat.
[Ship horn blares]
Where the hell is the crew?
You ready?
Vicky, don't, don't, don't!
I think there's something inside.
What?
What the hell happened to them?
Only one way to find out.
[Gasps]
[Breathing heavily]
I can't tell how old the uniform is, but he was a soldier.
They cracked his chest open.
Why?
To get to his lungs.
They're missing.
[Distant thudding]
We're not alone.
Don't move!
Tell us what happening?
I don't understand!
Get him up.
[Speaking Russian]
- Start talking!
- I wasn't here!
Do you know what they were doing?
We were just hired for the job few days, and that's it.
I don't know anything!
- He's lying.
- Of course he's lying.
- No, I'm not lying!
- Put him inside.
Get the door.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, they said it was the flu--
Spanish flu.
What the hell are you talking about?
Spanish flu killed 50 million people during World War I.
That's where the uniform is from.
- Yes.
- The body?
The soldier was very deep in the ice, and the virus was alive in him.
That's all I know.
That's the weapon.
The lungs are missing!
Where are they?
- Huh?
- I don't know.
- He's wasting our time.
- I don't know.
They must be on the way to the airport with a courier.
What's the courier's name?
Tell me!
All I know...
On the phone, American called him Alex when he was giving him flight information.
Which is what?
What's the flight information?
Flight 38, Air Moscow.
- To where?
- I don't know.
What was the courier's destination?
I don't know what city!
But he's bringing infected tissue to your country.
- Is everyone here?
- Almost, sir.
Shouldn't be long.
Very good.
Where have you been?
I pulled a sample of the carpet from the situation room, had it sent to the FBI lab.
And?
It's useless.
The fibers were too contaminated with the cleaning solution.
I'm sorry, Blake, but I have to begin the proceedings.
They need to know who they're putting into office.
I want to present the evidence to them.
What evidence?
The obscured security footage?
The statements the President made while suffering the effects of a stroke?
If nothing else, it could hold this off long enough for him to recover.
If you go in there with anything less than a smoking gun, you'll look like a lunatic.
Jarvis will sideline you, and he will keep you from ever proving it.
I can't just forget about this.
I'm not asking you to.
But for now, you're gonna have to play along.
If you can't do that, then don't go in that room.
I have been informed that the President's condition continues to deteriorate.
Given that he is incapacitated and unable to discharge the duties of the office, we must proceed.
Pursuant to Section 4 of the 25th Amendment we must achieve a majority vote to officially appoint Raymond Jarvis as acting President.
If there are no objections,
I'll commence the vote.
Secretary of Defense,
Watkins.
Aye.
Secretary of the Treasury,
Sassen.
Aye.
Secretary of the Interior, Wilson.
Aye.
Secretary of State, Carrol.
Aye.
Director of National Intelligence,
Sterling.
Director Sterling.
Aye.

Previously on The Event...
Sophia, she's bringing all of our people here.
It means genocide for humans.
They're looking for some kind of weapon.
You need to get word out.
We have to stop her.
Ugh!
Give me the phone!
[Objects clattering]
- Sean.
- Leila?
Someone outside of our group might be able to stop Sophia.
That someone is you.
As long as I'm alive,
I'm gonna do whatever it takes to stop you.
I would expect no less.
[Gunshot]
We will find you...
And we will punish you for what you have done.
It was Martinez's actions that escalated the conflict.
You and me working together?
What exactly are you talking about?
Martinez won't listen to reason, not from you, not from anyone.
So we are left with a more permanent solution.
It will be clean...
untraceable.
Follow my instructions, and by this time tomorrow, you'll be leader of the free world.
Good morning, Mr. President.
[Speaking Russian]
[Man shouting in Russian]
Halt!
[Thud]
Everybody out.
Open it.
[Clunk, air hissing]
[Cracking]
[Snap]
- Morning, vice.
- General.
All:
Good morning, Mr. President.
Good morning, everyone.
Uh, all right, looks like we have a full plate here.
Let's get started.
Coffee, sir?
Please.
We've established a task force to look into the evidence left behind by Herbert Mills, the sleeper who committed suicide.
Do we know any more about what he was doing?
No, not yet.
Unfortunately, all we had to go on was water from melted ice core samples left in an industrial microwave.
I'm aware of that.
Do you know where the ice core samples originated yet?
Analysis revealed microscopic sediments in the water found only in the Northwestern part of Siberia.
Siberia?
What relevance that may have is unclear.
Unclear won't cut it, Blake.
He killed himself so we couldn't find out what he was doing.
This is significant, which, chances are, it'll bring us back to Sophia.
Were there any trace elements in these samples?
Any signs of radioactivity?
No.
Not that we could detect.
Unfortunately, it'll be another 24 to 48 hours before any further testing results can come back.
Can we cut 48 hours down to 24?
I'm sorry, sir, but that's what I'm told.
General, where's NASA stand on this?
I think they're in place.
They're the ones doing the testing, so hopefully, we'll get word.
Okay, so...
I can work with that.
Right.
All right, let's check with the Russian intelligence service, see if we can get any cooperation finding out what might be of interest to Sophia in Northwestern Siberia.
I'll make a discreet inquiry.
Next on the agenda-- H.R. 9036.
Richard, I thought this was a done deal.
How does a slam dunk turn so quickly into a liability the House now wants to kill?
The latest unemployment figures just came out.
Trade agreement, sir-- suddenly not so popular.
There were a few defectors, but I still think we can salvage it.
I want names, specific congressmen I'll have to talk to.
I don't want to go into another vote not knowing...
[Slurring]
Let's take five...
[Speaking gibberish]
[Speaking gibberish]
Ah...
[Groans]
- Oh!
Mr. President!
- Are you all right,
Mr. President?

[Suspenseful music]
♪ The Event 1x18 ♪ Strain Original Air Date on April 25, 2011
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
We have the President, 46-year-old male with no significant past medical history.
On arrival, we found him with decreased responsiveness.
He has a G.C.S. of 11.
He's 230 over 110, heart rate 70.
All right, get two large-bore I.V.s.
Elevate the head of his bed.
Call the scanner.
Get him in stat.
I want you to give 20 of labetalol.
Recycle the pressures every five minutes.
Sir, what's your name?
[Muffled] Elias.
Sir, squeeze my hand.
Squeeze with your other hand.
Spoon the ambassador onto the speaker.
I'm sure he'll understand.
Do not cancel anything that does not directly require the President's signature, smile, or person.
It's imperative that the public knows that this government can run while he's down.
- How is he?
- Not good.
The C.T. scan shows bleeding in his brain.
The President has suffered a stroke.
Our main concern right now is controlling the intracranial pressure.
But if we can't control the bleeding by other means, we may have to go in and clip the vessel.
Surgery?
The President had a physical a month ago.
He was in perfect health.
It's an improbable case, statistically and otherwise.
We're doing our best.
If you'll excuse me, I should get back to him.
Of course.
[Woman speaking indistinctly on PA]
[Monitor beeping]
Mr. President.
Blake?
Yes, sir.
Come close.
Is Christina here?
She's on her way, five minutes out.
Oh.
What do the doctors say?
They're cautiously optimistic.
I can barely see you, and I know you're lying.
Whatever happens... you can't let Jarvis ascend to the Presidency.
I know.
Let's take things one step at a time.
He did this, Blake.
How?
Elias.
I saw... in the room, before I went down,
I looked in his eye.
He's behind this.
I don't know how, but that man does not take the oath.
Do you understand?
I understand.
- Blake...
- I understand.
I understand.
- Raymond.
- Christina.
- How is he?
- [Stammers]
We don't know yet, but it's-- but it's bad, Christina.
How did this happen?
He was fine this morning?
Well, strokes like this, they're very unpredictable.
I need to see him.
Is he--
If anyone's gonna make it through this, it's Eli.
He's the strongest, most willful man
I have ever met in my life.
And if he wants to live...
Whatever happens...
I want you to know that that man is a hero to me.
Thank you, Raymond.
Gi--give me a minute.
[Coughs]
[Vomiting]
[Clears throat]
[Camera shutters clicking]
Blake...
Blake.
We need to talk.
Walk with me.
We need to set a meeting with Jarvis and the heads of the Executive Department.
Why would we do that?
To talk about invoking Section 4.
I think that's premature.
He may not make it, Blake.
Well, I just left his side, and he's still conscious.
For how long?
There's a strict protocol here.
The 25th Amendment clearly states that in the event that the President becomes incapacitated, the cabinet must appoint the V.P. to acting President--
I've read the damn constitution.
Look, we cannot let the Vice President take office.
It's not up to us.
The country needs continuity of leadership.
Jarvis may be responsible for what's happened to the President.
Excuse me?
That's what Martinez just told me.
I'm inclined to believe him.
But he had a stroke.
We were both there.
He thinks Jarvis did something to cause it.
He's experiencing brain trauma.
Clearly, he's not thinking.
You don't know all the facts...
There are things the President and I know about Jarvis, about what he's capable of.
What things?
If you want me to help you, you have to tell me what you know.
This isn't the first time
Jarvis has attempted to eliminate the President.
Obviously, we covered it up, but I know you were made aware of the attempt on the President's life at Coral Gables.
The perpetrators had help from the inside.
- You think Jarvis was involved?
- Oh, I know he was.
He confessed.
You have to help me stop this succession before we end up putting a murderer in the White House.
To take him down, you would need irrefutable proof that he's responsible for the President's condition.
I can get it.
I just need time.
For those of you just tuning in, we are outside Bethesda Hospital, where President Martinez was rushed earlier this morning, uh, for undisclosed reasons.
We have learned from anonymous sources within the White House...
Seems there's reason to celebrate.
Everything's going according to your plan.
Don't.
There's no need to be callous.
I take no joy in seeing this man fall, nor should you.
Aaron reported back from Murmansk.
They've recovered the weapon.
And are we prepared on this end?
We're close.
We'll be ready in time.
Good.
Thank you for letting me know.
Why isn't Michael helping you with this?
I tried calling him.
He hasn't called me back.
Must have gotten held up.
Sophia, once the weapon is in our hands, how are we gonna deliver it on the scale we need?
Once Jarvis is in power, he'll help me.
He just doesn't know it yet.
Sean, they want to take over.
My father's people.
They're looking for some kind of weapon in Siberia near a place called Murmansk.
I also have a woman's name-- Irina Bogdanov.
She may be involved.
I don't know anything else.
I just--
Give me this.
Ah!
Where did you get this?
Leila, talk to me!
I know what Sophia's trying to do!
Who did you call?
What did you tell them?
How could you be a part of this?
I'm part of this because I'm trying to save our people.
I don't know what kind of damage you may have just caused, but if Sophia finds out, I won't be able to protect you.
I don't want your protection.
Who did you call?
Who did you call?
Sean.
[Breathing heavily]
What did you tell him?
Leila, this is very important.
- How much did you tell him?
- I told him everything-- what you're looking for in Siberia, what Sophia is trying to do and take over--
- She took my phone, Michael!
- No, Luis, it's all right.
She made a call to the outside.
No, no, she was just calling her boyfriend.
She called 911, and when I found out, she attacked me!
No, no, it's okay.
Michael, this is a serious breach.
She could have told them who we are, where we are.
We need to take her to Sophia now.
- That's not necessary.
- Michael...
The government learns of our location, we are as good as dead-- you know that!
[Breathing heavily]
Sophia needs to know what happened.
You know that.
I know.
I'm sorry, Michael.
I really am.
But the truth is you should have never brought her here.
Well, there's nothing we can do about it now.
What's done is done.
Grab his legs.
[Train horn blares]
I know we can't trust what Dempsey told us, but I do trust Leila, and she confirmed his story.
If there's even a chance of us stopping Sophia and her people from getting this weapon--
Leila didn't give you anything actionable.
What, the name of some woman?
Irina Bogdanov.
She also told me the weapon was somewhere near Murmansk.
[Scoffs]
Do you have any idea how cold it is in western Siberia this time of year?
Ten-- think ten degrees.
I'm not freezing my ass off just 'cause some delusional old man thinks the world's coming to an end.
When we came to France, we had even less to go on, didn't we?
And look what we were able to accomplish.
All right.
All right what?
Nonterrestrials, weapons of mass destruction-- count me in.
I'll help you.
You will?
Yes.
Why?
Don't try to analyze me, Sean.
Just take "yes" as an answer.
[Conductor speaking french] [Computer beeps]
Oh, finally!
- What, you found her?
- Oh, not exactly.
I've been searching passport databases and passenger manifests.
Problem is...
Irina Bogdanov isn't the name of a woman.
"Europol customs port of call declaration."
It's the name of a ship.
Currently docked at the port of Murmansk.
[Ship horn blows]
The subject is surprisingly intact... even after nearly 93 years...
Due, most likely, to the, uh, preservation in the permafrost.
Ready now to expose...
The organs.
The men are worried.
The job has risks that were not fully disclosed.
As long as they stay out of the clean room, your men are perfectly safe.
Money would be more convincing than words.
You don't like the job, then quit.
You're not getting more money.
Now, go get me another pack of smokes.
I'm out.
The lungs are magnificent.
I think we'll have very good results.
His epithelium are enlarged, and the primary bronchi appear to be filled with mucus or... or some kind of liquid.
[Ship horn blows]
[Muttering]
Oh!
Oh, my God!
Oh...
Oh...
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
I need to get out!
I've cut my suit.
I need you to let me out.
I'm sorry, Doctor.
Please.
Please.
It's gonna be all right.
I know what I'm doing.
Please!
Open the door!
Please!
[Pounding on door]
Open the door.
[Hinges squeaking]
He started exhibiting intracranial hypertension, and the pressure increased to the point that he lost consciousness.
Once the swelling goes down, will he wake up?
It's possible.
But if cerebral profusion-- uh, his circulation is compromised-- there is still the risk of ischemia.
- Another stroke.
- Yes, ma'am.
We should know fairly soon if he's responding to the treatment.
I know how difficult this is.
But you should prepare yourself, Mrs. Martinez.
If we don't see a marked improvement in his I.C.P., we will need to discuss his wishes for--
Please.
[Sniffles]
Mm-mm.
Elias...
I don't know if you can hear me, but I'm right here.
I know you're suffering.
I know how powerless you must feel right now.
Please fight.
[Whispering] I love you.
I love you so much.
I checked Jarvis' movements this morning.
Everywhere he went inside the White House before and after the President's collapse.
Were you able to find anything suspicious?
Yeah, maybe.
He arrived at the morning briefing in the situation room early.
He was there already when the rest of us came in.
Yeah.
I pulled up the surveillance footage from before we got there.
There.
He goes to the coffee cart.
Hey, what's he doing?
It's got to be the coffee.
He must have spiked it in some way.
With some kind of poison, something that would give the President a stroke?
Jarvis knows our morning routine.
He could easily have spiked the President's cup.
Maybe.
But you'll need more than pictures of the Vice President's back to convince anyone of it.
[Knock at door]
I thought I asked not to be disturbed.
I'm sorry, but it's not for you, Director Sterling.
Mr. Peel--the Vice President is looking for him and says it's urgent.
My apologies for the interruption.
It's not a problem, Mr. Vice President.
How can I help you?
Of all my duties as Vice President, this is the most unenviable one.
But as much as it pains me to do so,
I am bound.
I have notified the President Pro Tem of the Senate and the Speaker of the House that this communication is coming.
It's a written declaration... asking the President's Cabinet to enact
Section 4 of the 25th Amendment-- the succession protocol.
I truly wish it wasn't necessary, but it is my responsibility to assure that the continuity of our great democracy be maintained.
"Our great democracy."
Indeed.
Mr. Peel, would you please gather the Cabinet for the signing of the declaration...
As soon as possible?
The Secretary of State is on her way back from the Middle East.
She cut her trip short.
She'll be landing in a couple of hours.
Well, we'll convene as soon as she gets here.
I just want you both to know that I don't, uh...
I don't feel I'll be able to fill
Elias' shoes.
I only wish I can tread capably in the path he's already set for us.
The Secretary of State-- she's already landed.
I briefed her myself on the President's condition.
I know.
I just bought us a couple of hours.
But that's it.
We either find something on Jarvis now, or that man is gonna be the next President of the United States.
Well, I appreciate your call, but I'll have to call you back.
Mr. Vice President,
I have Prime Minister Wilheim on the phone, and the Russian premier just called before that.
Tell everyone I'm busy.
I don't want to be disturbed.
Yes, Mr. Vice President.
I'm sorry, Mr. Prime Minister.
The Vice President...
[Cell phone ringing]
- What do you want?
- Mr. Vice President...
I've been watching the news all morning.
Why hasn't Presidential authority been turned over to you yet?
Because the President isn't dead.
I had to petition the Cabinet to appoint me acting President.
Then I had to wait for them to ratify me, none of which would have been necessary had the powder you given me worked.
Just be calm.
The poison's working exactly as it's designed to-- taking its toll on the President slowly.
I just want this over.
Just be patient.
In the next few hours,
President Martinez will lapse into a coma.
Shortly after that, he will die.
And you'll be the next President of your country.
- Did you see that?
- What?
[Mouse clicks]
[Mouse clicks] Watch the Vice President.
Look what he does with his hand.
He took the President's sweetener packet off the table.
The packet must have contained the poison, so he removed the evidence.
We'll need more than surveillance footage to convince the rest of the President's Cabinet of any wrongdoing.
We need undeniable proof.
When the President dies, they will do an autopsy.
Are you sure they won't be able to detect what really happened?
We're sure.
The poison is designed to metabolize quickly in the system.
Once it does so, there'll be no trace of it left behind.
Well, you better be right, because I'm the one on the line here, not you.
As long as the sweetener packet was removed, there'll be no proof.
We may have a problem.
Why?
What is it?
When the President collapsed, his coffee spilled.
The coffee's laced with poison.
What are you doing?
What do you mean?
We were told to clean the room.
By who?
I was just following orders.
Is there some kind of problem?
[Vacuum whirring]
[Grunting]
Clean up the blood.
Make sure there's nothing outside the house.
We have to run!
We have to get out of here!
We're not going anywhere.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you...
For being on my side.
I'm not.
Leila, you are not one of them.
We're your people now, not Sean, not anyone else.
I know you can't fully accept that right now, but you have to try, because any more calls to the outside, any more attempts on your part to escape will get us both killed.
Now clean up the blood.
We're wasting time.
[Knock at door]
Michael...
It's Sophia.
Is that you?
[Knock at door]
Leila.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Is your father here?
Um...
Yeah.
But, uh...
I think he's sleeping.
Wake him up for me.
He said he doesn't want to be disturbed.
Wake him up, or I will.
Why, is something wrong?
I--
Sophia--
Michael.
Sophia.
Dad...
I didn't hear you come down.
Couldn't sleep.
- Is everything okay?
- Can we talk outside?
Sure.
Thank you, Leila.
Yeah.
Have you seen Luis?
No, not since last night.
He's not answering his phone.
Can you track him down for me?
Of course.
Yeah.
Good.
My Russian isn't quite what it used to be, but I'm pretty sure that's our ship.

Why are you here?
Why are you helping me?
Let me ask you a question, Sean.
Why do you think I'm here?
Honestly, I have no idea.
I-I don't understand you at all.
That's right.
You don't.
Let's move.
Excuse me.
We need your boat.
[Ship horn blares]
Where the hell is the crew?
You ready?
Vicky, don't, don't, don't!
I think there's something inside.
What?
What the hell happened to them?
Only one way to find out.
[Gasps]
[Breathing heavily]
I can't tell how old the uniform is, but he was a soldier.
They cracked his chest open.
Why?

They're missing.
[Distant thudding]
We're not alone.
Don't move!
Tell us what happening?
I don't understand!
Get him up.
[Speaking Russian]
- Start talking!
- I wasn't here!
Do you know what they were doing?
We were just hired for the job few days, and that's it.
I don't know anything!
- He's lying.
- Of course he's lying.
- No, I'm not lying!
- Put him inside.
Get the door.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, they said it was the flu--
Spanish flu.
What the hell are you talking about?
Spanish flu killed 50 million people during World War I.
That's where the uniform is from.
- Yes.
- The body?
The soldier was very deep in the ice, and the virus was alive in him.
That's all I know.
That's the weapon.
The lungs are missing!
Where are they?
- Huh?
- I don't know.
- He's wasting our time.
- I don't know.
They must be on the way to the airport with a courier.
What's the courier's name?
Tell me!
All I know...
On the phone, American called him Alex when he was giving him flight information.
Which is what?
What's the flight information?
Flight 38, Air Moscow.
- To where?
- I don't know.
What was the courier's destination?
I don't know what city!
But he's bringing infected tissue to your country.
- Is everyone here?
- Almost, sir.
Shouldn't be long.
Very good.
Where have you been?
I pulled a sample of the carpet from the situation room, had it sent to the FBI lab.
And?
It's useless.
The fibers were too contaminated with the cleaning solution.
I'm sorry, Blake, but I have to begin the proceedings.
They need to know who they're putting into office.
I want to present the evidence to them.
What evidence?
The obscured security footage?
The statements the President made while suffering the effects of a stroke?
If nothing else, it could hold this off long enough for him to recover.
If you go in there with anything less than a smoking gun, you'll look like a lunatic.
Jarvis will sideline you, and he will keep you from ever proving it.
I can't just forget about this.
I'm not asking you to.
But for now, you're gonna have to play along.
If you can't do that, then don't go in that room.
I have been informed that the President's condition continues to deteriorate.
Given that he is incapacitated and unable to discharge the duties of the office, we must proceed.

Previously on The Event...
Sophia, she's bringing all of our people here.
It means genocide for humans.
They're looking for some kind of weapon.
You need to get word out.
We have to stop her.
Ugh!
Give me the phone!
- Sean.
- Leila?
Someone outside of our group might be able to stop Sophia.
That someone is you.
As long as I'm alive,
I'm gonna do whatever it takes to stop you.
I would expect no less.
We will find you...
And we will punish you for what you have done.
It was Martinez's actions that escalated the conflict.
You and me working together?
What exactly are you talking about?
Martinez won't listen to reason, not from you, not from anyone.
So we are left with a more permanent solution.
It will be clean...
untraceable.
Follow my instructions, and by this time tomorrow, you'll be leader of the free world.
Good morning, Mr. President.
Halt!
Everybody out.
Open it.
- Morning, vice.
- General.
Good morning, Mr. President.
Good morning, everyone.
Uh, all right, looks like we have a full plate here.
Let's get started.
Coffee, sir?
Please.
We've established a task force to look into the evidence left behind by Herbert Mills, the sleeper who committed suicide.
Do we know any more about what he was doing?
No, not yet.
Unfortunately, all we had to go on was water from melted ice core samples left in an industrial microwave.
I'm aware of that.
Do you know where the ice core samples originated yet?
Analysis revealed microscopic sediments in the water found only in the Northwestern part of Siberia.
Siberia?
What relevance that may have is unclear.
Unclear won't cut it, Blake.
He killed himself so we couldn't find out what he was doing.
This is significant, which, chances are, it'll bring us back to Sophia.
Were there any trace elements in these samples?
Any signs of radioactivity?
No.
Not that we could detect.
Unfortunately, it'll be another 24 to 48 hours before any further testing results can come back.
Can we cut 48 hours down to 24?
I'm sorry, sir, but that's what I'm told.
General, where's NASA stand on this?
I think they're in place.
They're the ones doing the testing, so hopefully, we'll get word.
Okay, so...
I can work with that.
Right.
All right, let's check with the Russian intelligence service, see if we can get any cooperation finding out what might be of interest to Sophia in Northwestern Siberia.
I'll make a discreet inquiry.
Next on the agenda-- H.R. 9036.
Richard, I thought this was a done deal.
How does a slam dunk turn so quickly into a liability the House now wants to kill?
The latest unemployment figures just came out.
Trade agreement, sir-- suddenly not so popular.
There were a few defectors, but I still think we can salvage it.
I want names, specific congressmen I'll have to talk to.
I don't want to go into another vote not knowing...
Let's take five...
Ah...
- Oh!
Mr. President!
- Are you all right,
Mr. President?
♪ The Event 1x18 ♪ Strain Original Air Date on April 25, 2011
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
We have the President, 46-year-old male with no significant past medical history.
On arrival, we found him with decreased responsiveness.
He has a G.C.S. of 11.
He's 230 over 110, heart rate 70.
All right, get two large-bore I.V.s.
Elevate the head of his bed.
Call the scanner.
Get him in stat.
I want you to give 20 of labetalol.
Recycle the pressures every five minutes.
Sir, what's your name?
Elias.
Sir, squeeze my hand.
Squeeze with your other hand.
Spoon the ambassador onto the speaker.
I'm sure he'll understand.
Do not cancel anything that does not directly require the President's signature, smile, or person.
It's imperative that the public knows that this government can run while he's down.
- How is he?
- Not good.
The C.T. scan shows bleeding in his brain.
The President has suffered a stroke.
Our main concern right now is controlling the intracranial pressure.
But if we can't control the bleeding by other means, we may have to go in and clip the vessel.
Surgery?
The President had a physical a month ago.
He was in perfect health.
It's an improbable case, statistically and otherwise.
We're doing our best.
If you'll excuse me, I should get back to him.
Of course.
Mr. President.
Blake?
Yes, sir.
Come close.
Is Christina here?
She's on her way, five minutes out.
Oh.
What do the doctors say?
They're cautiously optimistic.
I can barely see you, and I know you're lying.
Whatever happens... you can't let Jarvis ascend to the Presidency.
I know.
Let's take things one step at a time.
He did this, Blake.
How?
Elias.
I saw... in the room, before I went down,
I looked in his eye.
He's behind this.
I don't know how, but that man does not take the oath.
Do you understand?
I understand.
- Blake...
- I understand.
I understand.
- Raymond.
- Christina.
How is he?
We don't know yet, but it's-- but it's bad, Christina.
How did this happen?
He was fine this morning?
Well, strokes like this, they're very unpredictable.
I need to see him.
Is he--
If anyone's gonna make it through this, it's Eli.
He's the strongest, most willful man
I have ever met in my life.
And if he wants to live...
Whatever happens...
I want you to know that that man is a hero to me.
Thank you, Raymond.
Gi--give me a minute.
Blake...
Blake.
We need to talk.
Walk with me.
We need to set a meeting with Jarvis and the heads of the Executive Department.
Why would we do that?
To talk about invoking Section 4.
I think that's premature.
He may not make it, Blake.
Well, I just left his side, and he's still conscious.
For how long?
There's a strict protocol here.
The 25th Amendment clearly states that in the event that the President becomes incapacitated, the cabinet must appoint the V.P. to acting President--
I've read the damn constitution.
Look, we cannot let the Vice President take office.
It's not up to us.
The country needs continuity of leadership.
Jarvis may be responsible for what's happened to the President.
Excuse me?
That's what Martinez just told me.
I'm inclined to believe him.
But he had a stroke.
We were both there.
He thinks Jarvis did something to cause it.
He's experiencing brain trauma.
Clearly, he's not thinking.
You don't know all the facts...
There are things the President and I know about Jarvis, about what he's capable of.
What things?
If you want me to help you, you have to tell me what you know.
This isn't the first time
Jarvis has attempted to eliminate the President.
Obviously, we covered it up, but I know you were made aware of the attempt on the President's life at Coral Gables.
The perpetrators had help from the inside.
- You think Jarvis was involved?
- Oh, I know he was.
He confessed.
You have to help me stop this succession before we end up putting a murderer in the White House.
To take him down, you would need irrefutable proof that he's responsible for the President's condition.
I can get it.
I just need time.
For those of you just tuning in, we are outside Bethesda Hospital, where President Martinez was rushed earlier this morning, uh, for undisclosed reasons.
We have learned from anonymous sources within the White House...
Seems there's reason to celebrate.
Everything's going according to your plan.
Don't.
There's no need to be callous.
I take no joy in seeing this man fall, nor should you.
Aaron reported back from Murmansk.
They've recovered the weapon.
And are we prepared on this end?
We're close.
We'll be ready in time.
Good.
Thank you for letting me know.
Why isn't Michael helping you with this?
I tried calling him.
He hasn't called me back.
Must have gotten held up.
Sophia, once the weapon is in our hands, how are we gonna deliver it on the scale we need?
Once Jarvis is in power, he'll help me.
He just doesn't know it yet.
Sean, they want to take over.
My father's people.
They're looking for some kind of weapon in Siberia near a place called Murmansk.
I also have a woman's name-- Irina Bogdanov.
She may be involved.
I don't know anything else.
I just--
Give me this.
Ah!
Where did you get this?
Leila, talk to me!
I know what Sophia's trying to do!
Who did you call?
What did you tell them?
How could you be a part of this?
I'm part of this because I'm trying to save our people.
I don't know what kind of damage you may have just caused, but if Sophia finds out, I won't be able to protect you.
I don't want your protection.
Who did you call?
Who did you call?
Sean.
What did you tell him?
Leila, this is very important.
- How much did you tell him?
- I told him everything-- what you're looking for in Siberia, what Sophia is trying to do and take over--
- She took my phone, Michael!
- No, Luis, it's all right.
She made a call to the outside.
No, no, she was just calling her boyfriend.
She called 911, and when I found out, she attacked me!
No, no, it's okay.
Michael, this is a serious breach.
She could have told them who we are, where we are.
We need to take her to Sophia now.
- That's not necessary.
- Michael...
The government learns of our location, we are as good as dead-- you know that!
Sophia needs to know what happened.
You know that.
I know.
I'm sorry, Michael.
I really am.
But the truth is you should have never brought her here.
Well, there's nothing we can do about it now.
What's done is done.
Grab his legs.
I know we can't trust what Dempsey told us, but I do trust Leila, and she confirmed his story.
If there's even a chance of us stopping Sophia and her people from getting this weapon--
Leila didn't give you anything actionable.
What, the name of some woman?
Irina Bogdanov.
She also told me the weapon was somewhere near Murmansk.
Do you have any idea how cold it is in western Siberia this time of year?
Ten-- think ten degrees.
I'm not freezing my ass off just 'cause some delusional old man thinks the world's coming to an end.
When we came to France, we had even less to go on, didn't we?
And look what we were able to accomplish.
All right.
All right what?
Nonterrestrials, weapons of mass destruction-- count me in.
I'll help you.
You will?
Yes.
Why?
Don't try to analyze me, Sean.
Just take "yes" as an answer.
Oh, finally!
- What, you found her?
- Oh, not exactly.
I've been searching passport databases and passenger manifests.
Problem is...
Irina Bogdanov isn't the name of a woman.
"Europol customs port of call declaration."
It's the name of a ship.
Currently docked at the port of Murmansk.
The subject is surprisingly intact... even after nearly 93 years...
Due, most likely, to the, uh, preservation in the permafrost.
Ready now to expose...
The organs.
The men are worried.
The job has risks that were not fully disclosed.
As long as they stay out of the clean room, your men are perfectly safe.
Money would be more convincing than words.
You don't like the job, then quit.
You're not getting more money.
Now, go get me another pack of smokes.
I'm out.
The lungs are magnificent.
I think we'll have very good results.
His epithelium are enlarged, and the primary bronchi appear to be filled with mucus or... or some kind of liquid.
Oh!
Oh, my God!
Oh...
Oh...
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
I need to get out!
I've cut my suit.
I need you to let me out.
I'm sorry, Doctor.
Please.
Please.
It's gonna be all right.
I know what I'm doing.
Please!
Open the door!
Please!
Open the door.
He started exhibiting intracranial hypertension, and the pressure increased to the point that he lost consciousness.
Once the swelling goes down, will he wake up?
It's possible.
But if cerebral profusion-- uh, his circulation is compromised-- there is still the risk of ischemia.
- Another stroke.
- Yes, ma'am.
We should know fairly soon if he's responding to the treatment.
I know how difficult this is.
But you should prepare yourself, Mrs. Martinez.
If we don't see a marked improvement in his I.C.P., we will need to discuss his wishes for--
Please.
Mm-mm.
Elias...
I don't know if you can hear me, but I'm right here.
I know you're suffering.
I know how powerless you must feel right now.
Please fight.
I love you.
I love you so much.
I checked Jarvis' movements this morning.
Everywhere he went inside the White House before and after the President's collapse.
Were you able to find anything suspicious?
Yeah, maybe.
He arrived at the morning briefing in the situation room early.
He was there already when the rest of us came in.
Yeah.
I pulled up the surveillance footage from before we got there.
There.
He goes to the coffee cart.
Hey, what's he doing?
It's got to be the coffee.
He must have spiked it in some way.
With some kind of poison, something that would give the President a stroke?
Jarvis knows our morning routine.
He could easily have spiked the President's cup.
Maybe.
But you'll need more than pictures of the Vice President's back to convince anyone of it.
I thought I asked not to be disturbed.
I'm sorry, but it's not for you, Director Sterling.
Mr. Peel--the Vice President is looking for him and says it's urgent.
My apologies for the interruption.
It's not a problem, Mr. Vice President.
How can I help you?
Of all my duties as Vice President, this is the most unenviable one.
But as much as it pains me to do so,
I am bound.
I have notified the President Pro Tem of the Senate and the Speaker of the House that this communication is coming.
It's a written declaration... asking the President's Cabinet to enact
Section 4 of the 25th Amendment-- the succession protocol.
I truly wish it wasn't necessary, but it is my responsibility to assure that the continuity of our great democracy be maintained.
"Our great democracy."
Indeed.
Mr. Peel, would you please gather the Cabinet for the signing of the declaration...
As soon as possible?
The Secretary of State is on her way back from the Middle East.
She cut her trip short.
She'll be landing in a couple of hours.
Well, we'll convene as soon as she gets here.
I just want you both to know that I don't, uh...
I don't feel I'll be able to fill
Elias' shoes.
I only wish I can tread capably in the path he's already set for us.
The Secretary of State-- she's already landed.
I briefed her myself on the President's condition.
I know.
I just bought us a couple of hours.
But that's it.
We either find something on Jarvis now, or that man is gonna be the next President of the United States.
Well, I appreciate your call, but I'll have to call you back.
Mr. Vice President,
I have Prime Minister Wilheim on the phone, and the Russian premier just called before that.
Tell everyone I'm busy.
I don't want to be disturbed.
Yes, Mr. Vice President.
I'm sorry, Mr. Prime Minister.
The Vice President...
- What do you want?
- Mr. Vice President...
I've been watching the news all morning.
Why hasn't Presidential authority been turned over to you yet?
Because the President isn't dead.
I had to petition the Cabinet to appoint me acting President.
Then I had to wait for them to ratify me, none of which would have been necessary had the powder you given me worked.
Just be calm.
The poison's working exactly as it's designed to-- taking its toll on the President slowly.
I just want this over.
Just be patient.
In the next few hours,
President Martinez will lapse into a coma.
Shortly after that, he will die.
And you'll be the next President of your country.
- Did you see that?
- What?
Watch the Vice President.
Look what he does with his hand.
He took the President's sweetener packet off the table.
The packet must have contained the poison, so he removed the evidence.
We'll need more than surveillance footage to convince the rest of the President's Cabinet of any wrongdoing.
We need undeniable proof.
When the President dies, they will do an autopsy.
Are you sure they won't be able to detect what really happened?
We're sure.
The poison is designed to metabolize quickly in the system.
Once it does so, there'll be no trace of it left behind.
Well, you better be right, because I'm the one on the line here, not you.
As long as the sweetener packet was removed, there'll be no proof.
We may have a problem.
Why?
What is it?
When the President collapsed, his coffee spilled.
The coffee's laced with poison.
What are you doing?
What do you mean?
We were told to clean the room.
By who?
I was just following orders.
Is there some kind of problem?
Clean up the blood.
Make sure there's nothing outside the house.
We have to run!
We have to get out of here!
We're not going anywhere.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you...
For being on my side.
I'm not.
Leila, you are not one of them.
We're your people now, not Sean, not anyone else.
I know you can't fully accept that right now, but you have to try, because any more calls to the outside, any more attempts on your part to escape will get us both killed.
Now clean up the blood.
We're wasting time.
Michael...
It's Sophia.
Is that you?
Leila.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Is your father here?
Um...
Yeah.
But, uh...
I think he's sleeping.
Wake him up for me.
He said he doesn't want to be disturbed.
Wake him up, or I will.
Why, is something wrong?
I--
Sophia--
Michael.
Sophia.
Dad...
I didn't hear you come down.
Couldn't sleep.
- Is everything okay?
- Can we talk outside?
Sure.
Thank you, Leila.
Yeah.
Have you seen Luis?
No, not since last night.
He's not answering his phone.
Can you track him down for me?
Of course.
Yeah.
Good.
My Russian isn't quite what it used to be, but I'm pretty sure that's our ship.
Security's heavy.
The other piers didn't have any.
Eight guards total, AK-47s-- quarter-mile stretch.
Completely surrounded.
On land.
As far as I can see, they don't have anybody in the water.
We can do it.
We just have to wait for them to get out of our eyeline.
What?
Everything you've done up till now has been for money or family.
Why are you here?
Why are you helping me?
Let me ask you a question, Sean.
Why do you think I'm here?
Honestly, I have no idea.
I-I don't understand you at all.
That's right.
You don't.
Let's move.
Excuse me.
We need your boat.
Where the hell is the crew?
You ready?
Vicky, don't, don't, don't!
I think there's something inside.
What?
What the hell happened to them?
Only one way to find out.
I can't tell how old the uniform is, but he was a soldier.
They cracked his chest open.
Why?
To get to his lungs.
They're missing.
We're not alone.
Don't move!
Tell us what happening?
I don't understand!
Get him up.
- Start talking!
- I wasn't here!
Do you know what they were doing?
We were just hired for the job few days, and that's it.
I don't know anything!
- He's lying.
- Of course he's lying.
- No, I'm not lying!
- Put him inside.
Get the door.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, they said it was the flu--
Spanish flu.
What the hell are you talking about?
Spanish flu killed 50 million people during World War I.
That's where the uniform is from.
- Yes.
- The body?
The soldier was very deep in the ice, and the virus was alive in him.
That's all I know.
That's the weapon.
The lungs are missing!
Where are they?
- Huh?
- I don't know.
- He's wasting our time.
- I don't know.
They must be on the way to the airport with a courier.
What's the courier's name?
Tell me!
All I know...
On the phone, American called him Alex when he was giving him flight information.
Which is what?
What's the flight information?
Flight 38, Air Moscow.
- To where?
- I don't know.
What was the courier's destination?
I don't know what city!
But he's bringing infected tissue to your country.
- Is everyone here?
- Almost, sir.
Shouldn't be long.
Very good.
Where have you been?
I pulled a sample of the carpet from the situation room, had it sent to the FBI lab.
And?
It's useless.
The fibers were too contaminated with the cleaning solution.
I'm sorry, Blake, but I have to begin the proceedings.
They need to know who they're putting into office.
I want to present the evidence to them.
What evidence?
The obscured security footage?
The statements the President made while suffering the effects of a stroke?
If nothing else, it could hold this off long enough for him to recover.
If you go in there with anything less than a smoking gun, you'll look like a lunatic.
Jarvis will sideline you, and he will keep you from ever proving it.
I can't just forget about this.
I'm not asking you to.
But for now, you're gonna have to play along.
If you can't do that, then don't go in that room.

I have a rash, so I couldn't shave above my lip this morning.
I just can't believe how fast it grows in.
Yeah, it's a family trait.
We all grow moustaches really fast.
Ed, I've never seen you with a moustache.
No, that hair thing is from his mother's side.
More specifically, his mother.
It's not just her side.
I can grow a moustache too.
Please.
You know something, you can't grow any facial hair at all.
I bei cagrow a more killer moustache than you.

Please, somebody make it interesting.
Hello, ed, it's Rosemary pernworth, your next-door neighbor.
Rosemary, I knew you'd come back.
Most women do after they kiss me.
First of all, I did not kiss you.
You kissed me.
Oh, just joking.
A little tongue in cheek.
Like you were doing when you kissed me.
Again, you kissed me.
But I'd rather not talk about that.
My lips are sealed.
Unlike yours...
When you kissed me.
Anyway, I would rather not spend more time here than I need to.
I'm here to bring you some things that you could find useful as the new president of the fleetridge homeowners' association.
Here are the keys to our closet at city hall.
Good-bye.
- You'll be back.
- No, I won't.
All right, the little one goes to the cabinet where we store the town nativity scene, although we're not allowed to display it anymore, but we can't figure out a respectful way of disposing of it.
And the square one is my locker...
Oh, at curves.
I'll take that.
And no one knows what the blue one is for, but we don't want to throw it out.
Good-bye.

- No, I won'
The first homeowners' association meeting is tomorrow night at your house.
As vice president, I have to be there.
Other than that, I am done with you.
You'll be back.
I will not.
I accidentally gave you my house key.
I hereby call this meeting of the fleetridge homeowners' association to order.
Present are ed goodson, Rosemary pernworth,
Marvin dingle, and Irving and ting-ting Cohen.
How odd.
What are the chances of you and your nurse having the same last name?
Nurse.
I'm his wife.
He's my boo.
Oh, forgive me, I didn't realize he was your boo.
Let the record show that I apologized to boo and ting-ting Cohen.
So noted.
Mr. president, the floor is yours.
Thank you, madame secretary.
Marvin is fine.
There have been many rumors about my presidency...
That I bribed someone, that I kissed the vice president.
Let me assure you that only one of these things are true, and I didn't bribe anyone.
You know, we're trying to have a meeting.
Marvin, would you please bring up the first item of business?
Okay, the gloucester house restoration party is Friday.
We'll need representation from the homeowners' association.
Typically, that would be the president.
No.
Meeting adjourned.
Wait.
Wait, wait.
Someone has to be there.
Who's free Friday night?
We can't.
It's shabbat.
Fine.
Fine.
I'll go.
I just have to shuffle some things.
I have things.
I'll go too.
I don't have things.
So moved.
Meeting adjourned.
Wait.
Hold on.
We haven't even gotten to new business.
I would like to bring up the issue of putting a speed bump on pine Lane.
Negative.
That's my street.
Meeting adjourned.
That is my street too.
And maniacs barrel down there at 60 Miles an hour.
It's not safe.
Well, it's not safe for me to hit a speed bump going 60 Miles an hour.
You know, maybe for once you could do something for somebody else, but I guess ed goodson doesn't do anything that inconveniences him.
Let'put to a vote.
All in favor of putting a speed bump on pine?
All but ed:
Aye.
Where's my foot?
Okay, 3 1/2 in favor.
All opposed?
So moved.
Speed bump will be installed on pine Lane.
Good.
I'll go next door and get the paperwork.
Meeting adjourned.
This could have been embarrassing.
I almost wore the same outfit.
So that Rosemary's a hot number, huh?
- Yeah.
- Between you and me,
I've been working on her since her husband passed away five years ago.
And I'm finally gonna ask her out at the house restoration party.
Between you and me, I'm gonna nail her.
That's terrible.
Anyway, how do we undo this speed bump thing?
Well, you're the president.
I guess you could just veto it, but that's kind of a real jerky thing to do.
Yeah, it is.
I hereby veto the speed bump.
Hey, anybody need any sweeping done?
'Cause I just got a new push broom.
Let me see.
Holy super Mario.
I know.
Doesn't he look exactly like tom Selleck from the nose down and the lip up?
You want to just pay me now?
Hey, hey.
It hasn't been a week yet.
Trust me, this baby's gonna sprout over night, and when it does, it's gonna look like one of those time-lapse nature videos.
Yours isn't even a moustache.
It's a blueprint for where a moustache might one day be built.
We'll see in a week.
Who's gonna be the judge?
Where the hell is the febreze?
I got to get some ting-ting off my couch-couch.
Dad, we need you to judge us.
Fine.
You're both disappointments.
Oh, I'm rry, people, this took me so long.
I couldn't find the papers.
Here you go.
Where... where is everybody?
The meeting broke up.
When?
- How long have you been gone?
- 30 minutes.
29 1/2 minutes ago.
Well, good for you.
Well, your first meeting.
What did you think of ting-ting and Irving?
Quite a pair.
Yes, I think he bought them for her.
Want to go upstairs?
Why?
What's upstairs?
My bed.
I'll take the dent in the middle.
You can have the high ground.
That's hilarious.
I'm serious.
Let's go upstairs and have some adult fun.
- Oh, ed.
- What's the problem?
You're pretty.
There's chemistry.
We're neighbors, so it's a very short walk of shame home.
Well, that well may be, ed, but I am n gonna just jump in bed with you.
Why not?
It'll be fun.
We can role-play.
We could be Irving and ting-ting.
I'll let you be Irving.
Look, I'm not that kind of woman.
Are you serious?
I need to be courted.
Hey, listen, I've been married three times.
And each one of them took me to court.
I'm done courting.
Well, I still believe in romance.
I hear you talking.
You can be ting-ting.
Ed, I'm not gonna just go upstairs with someone I barely know just to have some fun for a couple of hours.
Couple of hours?
You planning on watching a movie afterwards?
Gosh.
You're really selling it.
Hey, life is short.
You've got to grab the good times while you can.
Rosemary.
Well, ed, to me, the good times happen when you really care about somebody.
Otherwise, it's meaningless.
All right, let's split the difference.
We'll have sex and regret it afterwards.
You know, this is a perfect example of the difference between you and I.
You are the guy who wants to barrel down the street at 60 Miles an hour to get to your destination as fast as you can, and I want to go slowly and enjoy the journey along the way,
leave my left turn signal on for Miles, and Miles and Miles, as my daughter constantly points out.
- I'm not gonna beg.
- Well, good.
I will bribe.
For goodness' sake, just sign this paper so we can get our speed bump.
The speed bump is not gonna happen.
- We voted on it.
- I vetoed.
Why?
Because I wouldn't sleep with you?
No.
I did it beforehand when I still thought I had a chance.
But it shows you what kind of an honorable man I am.
Let's go upstairs and celebrate.
You are not an honorable man.
You're a selfish man!
Why don't you just go upstairs, lie in your dent, and play with your ting-ting.
So what are you doing?
A load of your beige, gray under-over-things.
Let me ask you a question.
You're a woman, right?
Well, if I'm not,
I'm wasting a lot of money at the gynecologist.
What do you want, ed?
Why do you think Rosemary wants me to court her?
Honestly, ed, I have no idea.
I mean, she acknowledged th she was attracted to , and when I offered to take her upstairs, she said no.
It's very confusing.
She wants you to court her.
That's what she said.
Who courts at my age?
- It's romantic.
- It's stupid.
Don't you want a woman who's romantic?
No.
Well, what do you want in a woman?
- Me.
- Ugh.
Ugh.
Ed, ed, what traits do you want in a woman?
I'm not picky.
Two legs and a working eye.
And the eye's negotiable.
Well, then, what's wrong with Rosemary?
She said no.
Well, then, romance her, take her out.
Buy her flowers.
Sweep her off her feet.
You could start by buying some new clothes.
I don't want to romance her.
Why not?
I don't wanna.
The real reason.
I don't wanna.
- The real reason.
- I don't want to romance her.
You know what I think?
I think you're afraid to put your heart on the line, because you really like this woman, and you know if something starts, then you're in deep, and the last few times you've done that, you've been burned.
And I think you're afraid to let that happen again.
- That's not it at all.
- Mm.
I don't care about this woman.
I just want somebody to be an Irving to my ting-ting.
You don't care about this woman, ed?
In all the years I've known you, this is the first woman you've even asked about, and there's been many of them.
- Many.
- All right.
All right.
Blagh.
Blagh.
All right, ed, what I'm saying is, if she wasn't special to you, would we even be having this conversation?
You don't know what you're talking about.
Mind your own business.
Okay.
Where do we go to buy new clothes?
Let's get the hell out of here.
Ed, you have to keep an open mind.
This is a very trendy store.
I'm sure you'll find something you like.
I think I see something over there.
All right, I'm just gonna see if they have this skirt in my size.
You know, just for fun.
How much for a lap dance?
Ed, ed, what... what are you doing?
I saw something I liked...
A stripper.
She's not a stripper.
She works here.
Ed, you've got to stop objectifying women.
It's off-putting.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
Two, four, six, eight.
Whoa, whowhoo!
Oa, and they're all there.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Can I help you?
Yes, we're looking for some men's clothing.
Although if you can't find any, I doubt if I can either.
Well, I would start out with the pants.
Maybe something a little less that.
And a little more something like...
like this?
I'm not paying $100 for a pair of pants that are ripped.
They're not ripped.
They're distressed.
It makes them cost more.
In that case, I'm wearing an $80 pair of underwear.
Look, why don't I just let you two figure this out?
Ed, what is wrong with you?
I thought you wanted me to help you.
I don't see why I have to look like a gay homeless man in order to prove that I like this woman.
If she doesn't like me for who I am, maybe she's not worth it.
Ed, think about it, if she did like you for who you are, would you trust her judgment?
Good point.
, yeah.
There it is.
It's not a moustache, okay?
It's just the light hitting your peach fuzz.
Trust me, I have this conversation with Bonnie all the time.
Oh, crap, I can't afford a ticket right now.
Okay, okay, relax, relax.
My friend Chris used to get out of tickets all the time.
- Great.
How?
- She'd cry and show her boobs.
My shirt's tucked in.
You just ran that stop sign.
License and registration, please.
I'm sorry, officer.
I was just talking to my brother, and we...
You know what?
Don't worry about it.
Those things are hard to see.
Just be careful next time.
Oh, thank you, officer.
Nice 'stache.
I hear that.
You're not wearing your seat belt.
That's a $50 fine.
Hey.
Nice party.
Ed.
What are you doing here, and why are you dressed like captain stubing?
I'm courting you.
Oh, you think you can just come here and win me over by dressing up like a handsome sailor?
Is it working?
A little bit.
Go on.
Well, my daughter-in-law said, if you care about someone, you got to make the effort.
So she took me to this trendy clothing store and tried to get me to buy some ridiculous clothes that no self-respecting man over the age of 20 would be caught dead in.
Hello, Rosemary.
Jealous much?
Anyway, if you're willing to give it a shot,
I'm willing to take it slow.
Are you serious?
Give you my word as an officer and a gentleman.
Well, I'm impressed and, I must say, a little surprised.
Well, actually, I have a surprise for you tonight that I'd like to show you.
- What is it?
- Trust me.
You'll like it.
What are you drinking?
Well, I wouldn't say no to a glass of chardonnay.
Unless it wanted to sleep with you.
Rosemary, would...
Would you like to dance?
But there's no music playing, Marvin.
I hate myself so much right now.
Anyway, I'm waiting for ed.
He apparently has some kind of surprise for me.
Oh, boy.
That's a killer.
- What?
- I can't say.
It's guy code.
He said he was gonna sleep with you.
- He did?
- No, he didn't.
He said he was gonna nail you.
He told you that?
I've said too much.
Nail you good, Rosemary.
Oh, here he comes, but you didn't hear that from me.
That he said he was gonna nail you.
One chardonnay.
Here's to taking it slow.
So what's the surprise you have for me?
Well, if I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise.
Let's just say you have to drive home with me tonight in order to see it.
Well, I have a little surprise myself.
I never want to speak to you again.
- What?
- Good-bye, ed.
Hmm.
Oh, no.
No, he tried to lure me back to his house.
Claimed he had some kind of surprise for me.
The only surprise was that I fell for it.
So stupid.
Do you think I'm stupid?
Ma'am, this service is for directions and emergencies only.
It is an emergency.
My neighbor's a complete ass...
Holy smokes.
Are you okay?
What happened?
That was the surprise.
He put in a speed bump.
Damn.
That was awful.
What happened?
All these years, I still don't understand women.
I guess the best thing to do is to treat 'em like cranberry sauce on Thanksgiving.
Take a spoonful and quickly pass it on to the next guy.
Wow, ed, on behalf of women everywhere, yuck.
See, the thing is, I really liked her.
That's why I don't put myself out there with women.
What was that for?
Putting in the speed bump.
I drove over it.
That's why I'm covered in milkshake.
I know.
I checked it out myself.
I can still do 45 without bottoming out my impala.
If you still want to, I'd be happy for you to court me.
It would be my honor.
Okay.
I'll go home and get changed.
And then you can begin courting.
Congratulations, ed.
Looks like you nailed it.
Have you no respect?
That is the woman I'm courting.
Wow, you really do look like your mother.
Henry, come on, it's time!
All right.
Came in last night, and it looks mean.
Come on.
Let's just see it.
All right.
Here we go.
Whoa.
Now, dad, who wins?
How'd you know it was fake?
I didn't.
Oh, my God.
What the hell happened to Paula Abdul?
She looks terrible.
Dad, that's Steven Tyler.
Oh.
He looks good.
Oh, my God, what happened to Oprah?
She looks terrible.
That's Randy Jackson.
Oh.
He looks good.
Hey.
Hey, how was open house?
Eh, a couple of nibbles.
What the hell is on your lip?
I have a rash, so I couldn't shave above my lip this morning.
I just can't believe how fast it grows in.
Yeah, it's a family trait.
We all grow moustaches really fast.
Ed, I've never seen you with a moustache.
No, that hair thing is from his mother's side.
More specifically, his mother.
It's not just her side.
I can grow a moustache too.
Please.
You know something, you can't grow any facial hair at all.
I bei cagrow a more killer moustache than you.
Care to make this interesting?
Please, somebody make it interesting.
Hello, ed, it's Rosemary pernworth, your next-door neighbor.
Rosemary, I knew you'd come back.
Most women do after they kiss me.
First of all, I did not kiss you.
You kissed me.
Oh, just joking.
A little tongue in cheek.
Like you were doing when you kissed me.
Again, you kissed me.
But I'd rather not talk about that.
My lips are sealed.
Unlike yours...
When you kissed me.
Anyway, I would rather not spend more time here than I need to.
I'm here to bring you some things that you could find useful as the new president of the fleetridge homeowners' association.
Here are the keys to our closet at city hall.
Good-bye.
- You'll be back.
- No, I won't.
All right, the little one goes to the cabinet where we store the town nativity scene, although we're not allowed to display it anymore, but we can't figure out a respectful way of disposing of it.
And the square one is my locker...
Oh, at curves.
I'll take that.
And no one knows what the blue one is for, but we don't want to throw it out.
Good-bye.
- You'll be back.
- No, I won'
The first homeowners' association meeting is tomorrow night at your house.
As vice president, I have to be there.
Other than that, I am done with you.
You'll be back.
I will not.
I accidentally gave you my house key.
I hereby call this meeting of the fleetridge homeowners' association to order.
Present are ed goodson, Rosemary pernworth,
Marvin dingle, and Irving and ting-ting Cohen.
How odd.
What are the chances of you and your nurse having the same last name?
Nurse.
I'm his wife.
He's my boo.
Oh, forgive me, I didn't realize he was your boo.
Let the record show that I apologized to boo and ting-ting Cohen.
So noted.
Mr. president, the floor is yours.
Thank you, madame secretary.
Marvin is fine.
There have been many rumors about my presidency...
That I bribed someone, that I kissed the vice president.
Let me assure you that only one of these things are true, and I didn't bribe anyone.
You know, we're trying to have a meeting.
Marvin, would you please bring up the first item of business?
Okay, the gloucester house restoration party is Friday.
We'll need representation from the homeowners' association.
Typically, that would be the president.
No.
Meeting adjourned.
Wait.
Wait, wait.
Someone has to be there.
Who's free Friday night?
We can't.
It's shabbat.
Fine.
Fine.
I'll go.
I just have to shuffle some things.
I have things.
I'll go too.
I don't have things.
So moved.
Meeting adjourned.
Wait.
Hold on.
We haven't even gotten to new business.
I would like to bring up the issue of putting a speed bump on pine Lane.
Negative.
That's my street.
Meeting adjourned.
That is my street too.
And maniacs barrel down there at 60 Miles an hour.
It's not safe.
Well, it's not safe for me to hit a speed bump going 60 Miles an hour.
You know, maybe for once you could do something for somebody else, but I guess ed goodson doesn't do anything that inconveniences him.
Let'put to a vote.

It is an emergency.
My neighbor's a complete ass...
Holy smokes.
Are you okay?
What happened?
That was the surprise.
He put in a speed bump.
Damn.
That was awful.
What happened?
All these years, I still don't understand women.
I guess the best thing to do is to treat 'em like cranberry sauce on Thanksgiving.
Take a spoonful and quickly pass it on to the next guy.
Wow, ed, on behalf of women everywhere, yuck.
See, the thing is, I really liked her.
That's why I don't put myself out there with women.
What was that for?
Putting in the speed bump.
I drove over it.
That's why I'm covered in milkshake.
I know.
I checked it out myself.
I can still do 45 without bottoming out my impala.
If you still want to, I'd be happy for you to court me.
It would be my honor.
Okay.
I'll go home and get changed.
And then you can begin courting.
Congratulations, ed.
Looks like you nailed it.
Have you no respect?
That is the woman I'm courting.
Wow, you really do look like your mother.
Henry, come on, it's time!
All right.
Came in last night, and it looks mean.
Come on.
Let's just see it.
All right.
Here we go.
Whoa.
Now, dad, who wins?
How'd you know it was fake?
I didn't.
Oh, my God.
What the hell happened to Paula Abdul?
She looks terrible.
Dad, that's Steven Tyler.
Oh.
He looks good.
Oh, my God, what happened to Oprah?
She looks terrible.
That's Randy Jackson.
Oh.
He looks good.
[Door opens]
Hey.
Hey, how was open house?
Eh, a couple of nibbles.
What the hell is on your lip?
I have a rash, so I couldn't shave above my lip this morning.
I just can't believe how fast it grows in.
Yeah, it's a family trait.
We all grow moustaches really fast.
Ed, I've never seen you with a moustache.
No, that hair thing is from his mother's side.
More specifically, his mother.
It's not just her side.
I can grow a moustache too.
[Laughs]
Please.
You know something, you can't grow any facial hair at all.
I bet I can grow a more killer moustache than you.
Care to make this interesting?
Please, somebody make it interesting.
[Door bell rings]
[Knock at door]
Hello, Ed, it's Rosemary Pernworth, your next-door neighbor.
Rosemary, I knew you'd come back.
Most women do after they kiss me.
First of all, I did not kiss you.
You kissed me.
Oh, just joking.
A little tongue in cheek.
Like you were doing when you kissed me.
Again, you kissed me.
But I'd rather not talk about that.
My lips are sealed.
Unlike yours...
When you kissed me.
Anyway, I would rather not spend more time here than I need to.
I'm here to bring you some things that you could find useful as the new president of the Fleetridge Homeowners' Association.
Here are the keys to our closet at city hall.
Good-bye.
- You'll be back.
- No, I won't.
[Knock at door]
All right, the little one goes to the cabinet where we store the town nativity scene, although we're not allowed to display it anymore, but we can't figure out a respectful way of disposing of it.
And the square one is my locker...
Oh, at curves.
I'll take that.
And no one knows what the blue one is for, but we don't want to throw it out.
Good-bye.
- You'll be back.
- No, I won' [knock at door]
The first homeowners' association meeting is tomorrow night at your house.
As vice president, I have to be there.
Other than that, I am done with you.
You'll be back.
I will not.
[Knock at door]
I accidentally gave you my house key.
I hereby call this meeting of the Fleetridge Homeowners' Association to order.
Present are Ed Goodson, Rosemary Pernworth,
Marvin Dingle, and Irving and Ting-Ting Cohen.
How odd.
What are the chances of you and your nurse having the same last name?
Nurse.
I'm his wife.
He's my boo.
Oh, forgive me, I didn't realize he was your boo.
Let the record show that I apologized to boo and Ting-Ting Cohen.
So noted.
Mr. president, the floor is yours.
Thank you, madame secretary.
Marvin is fine.
There have been many rumors about my presidency...
That I bribed someone, that I kissed the vice president.
Let me assure you that only one of these things are true, and I didn't bribe anyone.
You know, we're trying to have a meeting.
Marvin, would you please bring up the first item of business?
Okay, the Gloucester House restoration party is Friday.
We'll need representation from the homeowners' association.
Typically, that would be the president.
No.
Meeting adjourned.
Wait.
Wait, wait.
Someone has to be there.
Who's free Friday night?
We can't.
It's shabbat.
Fine.
Fine.
I'll go.
I just have to shuffle some things.
I have things.
I'll go too.
I don't have things.
So moved.
Meeting adjourned.
Wait.
Hold on.
We haven't even gotten to new business.
I would like to bring up the issue of putting a speed bump on Pine Lane.
Negative.
That's my street.
Meeting adjourned.
That is my street too.
And maniacs barrel down there at 60 Miles an hour.
It's not safe.
Well, it's not safe for me to hit a speed bump going 60 Miles an hour.
You know, maybe for once you could do something for somebody else, but I guess Ed Goodson doesn't do anything that inconveniences him.
Let'put to a vote.
All in favor of putting a speed bump on Pine?
All but Ed:
Aye.
Where's my foot?
Okay, 3 1/2 in favor.
All opposed?
So moved.
Speed bump will be installed on Pine Lane.
Good.
I'll go next door and get the paperwork.
Meeting adjourned.
This could have been embarrassing.
I almost wore the same outfit.
So that Rosemary's a hot number, huh?
- Yeah.
- Between you and me,
I've been working on her since her husband passed away five years ago.
And I'm finally gonna ask her out at the house restoration party.
Between you and me, I'm gonna nail her.
That's terrible.
Anyway, how do we undo this speed bump thing?
Well, you're the president.
I guess you could just veto it, but that's kind of a real jerky thing to do.
Yeah, it is.
I hereby veto the speed bump.
Hey, anybody need any sweeping done?
'Cause I just got a new push broom.
Let me see.
Holy Super Mario.
I know.
Doesn't he look exactly like Tom Selleck from the nose down and the lip up?
You want to just pay me now?
Hey, hey.
It hasn't been a week yet.
Trust me, this baby's gonna sprout over night, and when it does, it's gonna look like one of those time-lapse nature videos.
Yours isn't even a moustache.
It's a blueprint for where a moustache might one day be built.
We'll see in a week.
Who's gonna be the judge?
Where the hell is the febreze?
I got to get some ting-ting off my couch-couch.
Dad, we need you to judge us.
Fine.
You're both disappointments.
[Knoing] Oh, I'm rry, people, this took me so long.
I couldn't find the papers.
Here you go.
Where... where is everybody?
The meeting broke up.
When?
- How long have you been gone?
- 30 minutes.
29 1/2 minutes ago.
Well, good for you.
Well, your first meeting.
What did you think of Ting-Ting and Irving?
Quite a pair.
Yes, I think he bought them for her.
[Chuckles]
[Laughs]
Want to go upstairs?
Why?
What's upstairs?
My bed.
I'll take the dent in the middle.
You can have the high ground.
That's hilarious.
I'm serious.
Let's go upstairs and have some adult fun.
- Oh, Ed.
- What's the problem?
You're pretty.
There's chemistry.
We're neighbors, so it's a very short walk of shame home.
Well, that well may be, Ed, but I am n gonna just jump in bed with you.
Why not?
It'll be fun.
We can role-play.
We could be Irving and Ting-Ting.
I'll let you be Irving.
Look, I'm not that kind of woman.
Are you serious?
I need to be courted.
Hey, listen, I've been married three times.
And each one of them took me to court.
I'm done courting.
Well, I still believe in romance.
I hear you talking.
You can be Ting-Ting.
Ed, I'm not gonna just go upstairs with someone I barely know just to have some fun for a couple of hours.
Couple of hours?
You planning on watching a movie afterwards?
Gosh.
You're really selling it.
Hey, life is short.
You've got to grab the good times while you can.
Rosemary.
Well, Ed, to me, the good times happen when you really care about somebody.
Otherwise, it's meaningless.
All right, let's split the difference.
We'll have sex and regret it afterwards.
You know, this is a perfect example of the difference between you and I.
You are the guy who wants to barrel down the street at 60 Miles an hour to get to your destination as fast as you can, and I want to go slowly and enjoy the journey along the way,
leave my left turn signal on for Miles, and Miles and Miles, as my daughter constantly points out.
- I'm not gonna beg.
- Well, good.
I will bribe.
For goodness' sake, just sign this paper so we can get our speed bump.
The speed bump is not gonna happen.
- We voted on it.
- I vetoed.
Why?
Because I wouldn't sleep with you?
No.
I did it beforehand when I still thought I had a chance.
But it shows you what kind of an honorable man I am.
Let's go upstairs and celebrate.
You are not an honorable man.
You're a selfish man!
Why don't you just go upstairs, lie in your dent, and play with your ting-ting.
So what are you doing?
- A load of your beige, gray under-over-things.
Let me ask you a question.
You're a woman, right?
Well, if I'm not,
I'm wasting a lot of money at the gynecologist.
What do you want, Ed?
Why do you think Rosemary wants me to court her?
Honestly, Ed, I have no idea.
I mean, she acknowledged th she was attracted to , and when I offered to take her upstairs, she said no.
It's very confusing.
She wants you to court her.
That's what she said.
Who courts at my age?
- It's romantic.
- It's stupid.
Don't you want a woman who's romantic?
No.
Well, what do you want in a woman?
- Me.
- Ugh.
Ugh.
Ed, Ed, what traits do you want in a woman?
I'm not picky.
Two legs and a working eye.
And the eye's negotiable.
Well, then, what's wrong with Rosemary?
She said no.
Well, then, romance her, take her out.
Buy her flowers.
Sweep her off her feet.
You could start by buying some new clothes.
I don't want to romance her.
Why not?
I don't wanna.
The real reason.
I don't wanna.
- The real reason.
- I don't want to romance her.
You know what I think?
I think you're afraid to put your heart on the line, because you really like this woman, and you know if something starts, then you're in deep, and the last few times you've done that, you've been burned.
And I think you're afraid to let that happen again.
- That's not it at all.
- Mm.
I don't care about this woman.
I just want somebody to be an Irving to my ting-ting.
You don't care about this woman, Ed?
In all the years I've known you, this is the first woman you've even asked about, and there's been many of them.
- Many.
- All right.
All right.
Blagh.
Blagh.
All right, Ed, what I'm saying is, if she wasn't special to you, would we even be having this conversation?
You don't know what you're talking about.
Mind your own business.
Okay.
Where do we go to buy new clothes?
Let's get the hell out of here.
Ed, you have to keep an open mind.
This is a very trendy store.
I'm sure you'll find something you like.
I think I see something over there.
All right, I'm just gonna see if they have this skirt in my size.
You know, just for fun.
How much for a lap dance?
Ed, Ed, what... what are you doing?
I saw something I liked...
A stripper.
She's not a stripper.
She works here.
Ed, you've got to stop objectifying women.
It's off-putting.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
Two, four, six, eight.
Whoa, whowhoo!
Oa, and they're all there.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Can I help you?
Yes, we're looking for some men's clothing.
Although if you can't find any, I doubt if I can either.
Well, I would start out with the pants.
Maybe something a little less that.
And a little more something like...
like this?
I'm not paying $100 for a pair of pants that are ripped.
They're not ripped.
They're distressed.
It makes them cost more.
In that case, I'm wearing an $80 pair of underwear.
Look, why don't I just let you two figure this out?
Ed, what is wrong with you?
I thought you wanted me to help you.
I don't see why I have to look like a gay homeless man in order to prove that I like this woman.
If she doesn't like me for who I am, maybe she's not worth it.
Ed, think about it, if she did like you for who you are, would you trust her judgment?
Good point.
, yeah.
There it is.
It's not a moustache, okay?
It's just the light hitting your peach fuzz.
Trust me, I have this conversation with Bonnie all the time.
[Police sirens wail]
Oh, crap, I can't afford a ticket right now.
Okay, okay, relax, relax.
My friend Chris used to get out of tickets all the time.
- Great.
How?
- She'd cry and show her boobs.
My shirt's tucked in.
You just ran that stop sign.
License and registration, please.
I'm sorry, officer.
I was just talking to my brother, and we...
You know what?
Don't worry about it.
Those things are hard to see.
Just be careful next time.
Oh, thank you, officer.
Nice 'stache.
I hear that.
You're not wearing your seat belt.
That's a $50 fine.
[Jazz music]
Hey.
Nice party.
Ed.
What are you doing here, and why are you dressed like captain stubing?
I'm courting you.
Oh, you think you can just come here and win me over by dressing up like a handsome sailor?
Is it working?
A little bit.
Go on.
- Well, my daughter-in-law said, if you care about someone, you got to make the effort.
So she took me to this trendy clothing store and tried to get me to buy some ridiculous clothes that no self-respecting man over the age of 20 would be caught dead in.
Hello, Rosemary.
Jealous much?
Anyway, if you're willing to give it a shot,
I'm willing to take it slow.
Are you serious?
Give you my word as an officer and a gentleman.
Well, I'm impressed and, I must say, a little surprised.
Well, actually, I have a surprise for you tonight that I'd like to show you.
- What is it?
- Trust me.
You'll like it.
What are you drinking?
Well, I wouldn't say no to a glass of chardonnay.
Unless it wanted to sleep with you.
Rosemary, would...
Would you like to dance?
But there's no music playing, Marvin.
I hate myself so much right now.
Anyway, I'm waiting for Ed.
He apparently has some kind of surprise for me.
Oh, boy.
That's a killer.
- What?
- I can't say.
It's guy code.
He said he was gonna sleep with you.
- He did?
- No, he didn't.
He said he was gonna nail you.
He told you that?
I've said too much.
Nail you good, Rosemary.
Oh, here he comes, but you didn't hear that from me.
That he said he was gonna nail you.
One chardonnay.
Here's to taking it slow.
So what's the surprise you have for me?
Well, if I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise.
Let's just say you have to drive home with me tonight in order to see it.
Well, I have a little surprise myself.
I never want to speak to you again.
- What?
- Good-bye, Ed.
Hmm.
Oh, no.
No, he tried to lure me back to his house.
Claimed he had some kind of surprise for me.
The only surprise was that I fell for it.
So stupid.
Do you think I'm stupid?
Ma'am, this service is for directions and emergencies only.
It is an emergency.
My neighbor's a complete ass...
[Exclaims]
Holy smokes.
Are you okay?
What happened?
That was the surprise.
He put in a speed bump.
Damn.
That was awful.
What happened?
All these years, I still don't understand women.
I guess the best thing to do is to treat 'em like cranberry sauce on Thanksgiving.
Take a spoonful and quickly pass it on to the next guy.
Wow, Ed, on behalf of women everywhere, yuck.
See, the thing is, I really liked her.
That's why I don't put myself out there with women.
[Knock at door]
What was that for?
Putting in the speed bump.
I drove over it.
That's why I'm covered in milkshake.
I know.
I checked it out myself.
I can still do 45 without bottoming out my Impala.
If you still want to, I'd be happy for you to court me.
It would be my honor.
Okay.
I'll go home and get changed.
And then you can begin courting.
Congratulations, Ed.
Looks like you nailed it.
Have you no respect?
That is the woman I'm courting.
Wow, you really do look like your mother.
Henry, come on, it's time!
All right.
Came in last night, and it looks mean.
Come on.
Let's just see it.
All right.
Here we go.
[Stomps]
Both:
Whoa.
Now, dad, who wins?
[screams]
How'd you know it was fake?
I didn't.
[ Bagpipes playing "Amazing Grace" ]
[ Piper crying ]
[ Kove crying ] Rhubarb!
Rhubarb!
[ Tasers zap ]
No!
[ Tasers zap ]
Kove:
Trent!
[ Piper wailing ]
Diego!
Diego!
Good afternoon, team.
How are you enjoying the new artificial intelligence system we've installed in the S.U.V.s?
I'm loving it.
Too damn hot in San Diego.
We got to get back home to Alaska and bag us some eskimo babes.
Sounds like a plan.
Ah, very good.
I can see that the S.U.V.s have bonded with you and are mirroring your personalities.
Sometimes I kill.
Sometimes I cry.
Sometimes I kill and cry, but mostly I just cry.
It's true.
I don't trust these talking cars.
You'll love this S.U.V., guaranteed.
Well, let's just see about that.
Nice one.
Sam, meet Damian Thresh.
He's our new intern.
He mysteriously showed up when our last intern mysteriously disappeared.
I want you to show him the ropes today.
Welcome aboard, Damian.
I am so looking forward to working with you, Sam...
So looking forward.
Great.
Trent:
What do you mean, you don't like the San Diego chicken?
You heard me.
He's a terrible mascot, a complete joke.
What are you talking about?
You're an idiot.
- You're an idiot.
- What?
What are you doing?
This isn't our exit.
- Shut it, flesh bag.
- You shut-
- Aah!
God!
Damn!
Unh!
Unh!
Unh!
[ Horn honking ]
[ Tires screech ] Whoa!
It's about to get hot in here.
Seat warmer is getting hot!
Buckle up, Mr. Alaska.
This isn't you, man!
This isn't you!
[ Tires screech ]
Trent:
Come on, now!
Pull over!
Aah!
[ Tires screeching ]
Looks like this S.U.V. is gonna have one less h-u-m-a-n.
[ Tires screeching ]
Trent!
[ Gasping ]
Piper!
[ Muffled screaming ]
Alphonse:
Trent!
Trent, the S.U.V.s took Alphonse!
They're getting away!
Not all of them.
The A.I. in the S.U.V.s has gone rogue.
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Samuel.
Artificial intelligence would never betray mankind.
There must be someone behind this.
Then it's obviously this Damian guy.
I mean, he's a creepy weirdo.
It's got to be him.
- Hi, Sam.
- Oh.
Is that doll supposed to be me?
Who?
This doll?
Why do you think it's you?
Do you want it to be you?
It could be you, if you really want it to.
No, thank you.
Unh!
You'll never make me talk, human.
Oh, I'll make you sing, S.U.V.
I just hope you do it... in key.
Trent, we don't torture.
We're N.T.S.F.
[ Scoffs ]
Now I'm not.
Now, I asked you-- Why did you turn on us?
Do your worst, Hauser.
I asked you why!
- Aah!
- Stop it!
Don't lower yourself to this S.U.V.'s level.
You're asking the wrong question, chief.
It's not why.
It's who.
Okay, then who?
It's not so much who as how.
[ Laughs evilly ]
You gas-guzzling bastard!
Aah!
[ Steam hissing ]
Great, Trent.
Now we're never gonna know how, who, or why did this!
The only mystery, Piper, is who taught you grammar.
Take a look.
What do you know about drive bot technologies?
It's a dead end.
Not quite dead.
I did some research, and I found out the S.U.V.s' A.I. is operated by remote.
I hacked the system and found out the signal is coming from a satellite in deep space.
And may I say, it is a great pleasure to meet you, Agent Hauser--
A great, great pleasure.
Who the hell is this guy?
'Cause I like him a lot.
Great work.
This doesn't creep anyone else out?
Trent:
The S.U.V.s are just pawns.
There's a mystery king out there, and he just castled with the rook, but I'm about to move my queen.
If you've ever met my queen, you would know she's a real bitch.
When she gets mad, she looks for a mate, but not the kind of mate you have sex with-- the kind you pay for with a check:
A checkmate.
And this checkmate's about to be cashed right after I endorse it with blood.
Uh, what does that mean?
It means I'm going to space.
Sam:
Just say "I'm going to space" next time.
I thought we were friends.
I thought we were tight.
[ Engine revs, tires screech ]
Alaska forever!
Useless, buddy.
Alaska sucks.
Aah!
Glad you could fit me in last minute like this.
No problemo.
We had a shuttle running plasma to the space station, anyways.
I'm just glad I had a favor left to cash in with you NASA guys.
American heroes got to stick together.
[ Alarm blaring ]
[ Speaking German ]
[ Whistles ]
Kove?
- Ohh!
- Aah!
What do you want?
!
Trent never showed up to NASA.
How can that be?
Damian scheduled the car service himself.
Damian!
I knew it, you son of a bitch.
You sweater-vest-loving bastard!
No, wait!
What are you doing?
Get off my computer.
It's--
It's just a thank-you card for being so great to work with.
I had to Photoshop it.
What's with all the headless, creepy dolls?
I got them as gifts for everybody.
The heads are on back order.
So, you're not a mole sent to destroy N.T.S.F. from within?
What?
What?
You mean you've mistrusted me all this time?
[ Cries ]
You monster.
No, I...
I trust you.
Oh, no.
What's going on?
!
[ Device beeping rapidly ]
[ Device whirring ]
[ Breathing heavily ]
[ Grunting ]
Unh!
[ Groans ]
[ Breathing heavily ]
[ Vehicle approaching ]
Oh, no, not again.
I thought I killed you!
[ Engine shuts off ]
[ Gasps ]
Remember me?
!
Trent:
Aah!
Who are you?
!
[ Both screaming ]
[ Snake rattling ]
Die!
[ Gasping ]
[ Birds chirping ]
Karen DiStephano?
Anyways, that's when I realized
I was gonna be a temp for the rest of my life!
I love it!
But I'm crazy.
They should do a reality show about my life.
You know, I don't normally go out on blind dates, but you're a real listener.
I like that.
So, you gonna call me for another date?
Yeah.
Totally.
You better 'cause if you're lying, I'm gonna get ya!
[ Laughing ] I'm gonna get ya!
Get-
- Oh, I have to tinkle.
Bye!
[ Door closes ]
[ Trent chuckles ]
Oh, yeah.
[ Coughs ]
[ Gasps ]
[ Bagpipes playing "Amazing Grace" ]
Stop the funeral!
Stop the funeral!
[ Music stops ]
The S.U.V.S are evil.
Alphonse, we thought you were dead.
What?
You thought I was dead?
Well, then, where's my funeral?
This is a double funeral.
Yours is right over there.
Alphonse:
Man, y'all couldn't have done better?
Fine-
- I want one of these guards to stand by mine.
You, stand by mine.
[ Taser zaps ]
Aah!
Ugh!
Everything is going according to plan, exactly according to plan.
That's what they get for forgetting my birthday.
Happy Birthday, Trent.
Let's roll, birthday boy.
[MUSIC]
Sothisweekwe'restudyingcareer pathways in pharmacy, and we're talking about the roles of pharmacists in the healthcare system.
And you've been meeting some different practitioners throughout the course, and we're going to be meeting some more interesting ones this week.
And we have one with us today, her name is Angela
Zielinski, she works for the VA Ambulatory Center in Columbus, Ohio.
And Angie, I thank you for being with us.
Thankforhavingme.
[CROSSTALK] anxious to hear about the interesting practice you have and we'll kind of get into that, but before we do so, can you just tell me, tell us a little bit about your background and how you got to where you are today.
Okay.
I completed my PharmD here at Ohio State, I completed that in 2003.
And then I applied for residency and I was fortunate enough, fortunate enough to match with the VA, the Veteran Affairs clinic here in Columbus, Ohio,
where I've been for the last 10 years.
And then during my time there I've gone on to become board certified in pharmacotherapy, and also I got my CDE or certified diabetes educator.
Good,greattraining.
and you know you've hit on several things that we have or will talk about in this course.
So, you know, board certification and residency programs and, and you've hit several things that have, have led you down a pathway to being the practitioner you are today.
Mm-hm.
So,thanksforsharingthat with us.
So, got a good background, and we're anxious to hear about this practice you have, so can you describe your, your clinic, your, your ambulatory care center, and kind of what your role is in it?
Okay.
the, the Veteran Affairs, the ambulatory care clinic itself is quite large, there's lots of different specialties available there.
So, pa, patients can go for dermatology, endocrinology, rheumatology, same day surgery we have a nephrologist, so basically anything, any kind of specialty, almost any kind of specialty we have available there.
the pharmacists and, I'll talk about my practice in particular, I like to think of it more as what I do in a week rather than what I do in a day.
Mm-hm.
because
I do something different every day.
Yeah.
Sodependingon whatday oftheweek it is, like today I had my MTM clinic, which is the medication therapy management clinic, so I saw patients with diabetes, high blood pressure high cholesterol.
I saw a patient that was new to the VA who needed to get some of his medications switched over because we work within a formulary system.
Mm-hm.
SoI hadto helpmakesome conversions for what he was on currently to things that we have on our formulary, and then also make recommendations for his physician for follow up after we made those changes.
I might see a patient who's getting started on an, like a Procrit or an Epogen to help build up their blood if they're anemic from having chronic kidney disease.
So it's a wide variety in my MTM clinic,
I never know, I mean I have a general idea what
I'm going to get that day, but it's usually pretty good variety.
if, if it's a Tuesday, I'm working in the anti-coagulation clinic, monitoring patients on Warfarin or Pradaxa.
if it is, then in the afternoon, since we do have a formulary system, anything that is non-formulary has to be requested and it goes through a review, and the pharmacist, the clinical pharmacy specialists, review those requests.
So I'll review non-formulary requests and either approve or deny.
And then if we deny we have to make a recommendation for what, like, formulary alternative would be a therapeutic equivalent for what the, what the patient needs.
on a Wednesday I might be working in the heart disease group, which is a group appointment, where I may have anywhere from eight to ten patients all at the same time.
And I work with a nutritionist, and we make adjustments on their cholesterol and blood pressure medications, and talk about lifestyle changes to help decrease their risk of heart disease and stroke.
I also on Wednesdays may work in renal clinic, and that I work in con, I don't have prescriptive authority in renal clinic, but I work re, with the renal physician making recommendations for medication changes.
I think that's, I think that's a pretty good summary.
[LAUGH]
Youdoalot .
OfwhatIdoduringtheweek.
Andyou'reactually,you 'resortof a walking dictionary from our, we have a thing called pharmacy fundamentals we're talking about in the course Angie, and you've hit about every one of them as you walk through here.
Ohreally,
[CROSSTALK].
SoMTMandall the kindofthings you're doing, so that we start to see that this is real, I mean, you're practicing in this way.
Yeah.
Sooneof thethingsthat Iam interested in is we know that VA pharmacists and, and actually kind of federal pharmacists in the United States sometimes are able to practice differently, and
VA pharmacists have pretty innovative practices.
And in some cases as I understand it VA pharmacists have prescriptive authority.
Mm-hm.
Soandthis,thisisof interestto us, so can you tell us what that means and, you know how does, how does it work, and how does a pharmacist get that author, authority to do it in the VA?
Okay.
so every, every clinical pharmacy specialist within the
VA may, can operate underneath a scope of practice.
And the scope of practice has to be signed off by the, like the, the head of the whole, the clinic as well as the Chief of Pharmacy.
in order to get a scope of practice you need to have a PharmD or a Masters degree.
You need to have a residency or equivalent experience.
They encourage you to become board certified as well.
Mm-hm.
andthenyouwillbegranted prescriptive authority underneath your scope of practice.
So, for example we have a pain clinic at the VA, and I don't work in the pain clinic.
we can't write, no pharmacist as far as I know within the VA system can write for narcotics, as far as I know.
it has to be, that, that particular thing has to be allowable under state law, since we're a federal facility we operate under federal law, but the narcotic part it has to be a state law that pharmacist can prescribe that.
Right.
Butthepharmacistatpain clinic can write for non-controlled substances, so, it might be like a
Gabapentin, you know, to help with neuropathy.
Mm-hm.
Oritmightbea stoolsoftener to help combat the side effect of the narcotic.
but I don't work in that clinic, so I can't prescribe those medications.
So, you have to have the training and the skill for the disease states that you're able to write for.
So if a doctor would put in a consult for me for whatever disease state usually it's going to be diabetes or high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and then within my scope, I'm able to write for, initiate,
adjust, stop diabetes medications, blood pressure medications, cholesterol medications.
If a patient would come to me complaining, you know, that they're, they're having neuropathy from their diabetes, I cannot, even though I'm seeing them for diabetes,
I can't write for their Gabapentin.
I would have to go and talk with the physician and have them evaluate the, the patient to see if that would be appropriate for them.
Yeah.
Soat,on thesametokenlet's sayI have a patient that's anemic, and I see them for diabetes, in order for me to, you know, if they would need to start Procrit the doctor would have to put
in a separate consult and then I could take over at that as well.
Okay.
So you have to have certain qualifications?
Mm-hm.
Youhaveto be approvedbythe directors in your,
Yep,inyourfacility.
Inyou'reclinic.
youhave,we alsodopeer review.
Mm-hm.
Ona monthlybasis,somychartsare reviewed.
I, it's anywhere from five to ten charts per month are reviewed from when I see a patient to make sure that I'm making good, therapeutic decisions.
Interesting.
Andthenthat'sreviewed.
That's,that'sthat'sout there isn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sothat's,that'sgood.
Iknowno different,Ithinkit's wonderful.
That's, that's, that's wonderful.
let me, and I'm sure you probably have a quick answer to this but, how important is collaborative practice in your work, you know, how does, how does that work around this prescriptive authority but even around all these daily things you do in the clinics?
Okay.
I think one of the newer buzz words is primary care medical home.
Mm-hm.
wehaveourown termforitwithin the
VA system, we call it the PACT model, or the
Patient Aligned Care Team.
And within the team I always tell my patients I belong to team four, which is two physicians and a nurse practitioner along with three RNs, three LPNs.
We have a social worker who is an expanded team member, so she's just, not just a member of team four but she serves like three other teams as well.
We have a nutritionist within our team.
we have monthly meetings where we will, one wonderful thing about working within the VA is that it's very easy to pull data from the computer system.
So if we notice that, you know what, we're not performing as well in a certain measure, we can sit down and say okay, we're going to focus on getting our A1C's down.
And we can see the patients, and we can kind of focus on them, and say okay, what does Mr so-and-so need.
You know, social work can you help with getting him, you know, he has to go to the food pantry, can you help him get set up with food stamps?
So it's, it's vitally important.
Mm-hm.
Andthenwithinthat,that PACT team too, one of the things I, I like so much is that I have pharmacy students with me, the physicians have medical students and residents, the nurses have nursing students.
So then they can see kind of how it works and what a great model it is and then hopefully when they graduate and start their own practices, they can, you know.
Carryitwiththem.
Carryitwiththem,exactly.
Yeah.
So we've talked about collabor, collaborative practice a lot in this course, but this is really formalized where you're working.
Yeah.
Andit's,it 'steambasedandit's kind of established models, so that's that's, that's very interesting.
I have one more question for you.
Yes.
AndI 'm,I 'mguessingthat, you know, a large number of the patients you see are, are elderly in, in the VA system.
and you know caring for seniors is important and, you know, we're, our population is aging, and so maybe, could you give us some, your thoughts on, you know, special skills that are needed to work with elderly people.
And, you know, how, how will our health system have to shift to accommodate these needs?
Oneofthefirstthingsthatcomes to mind is when I first started working at the VA I would come home and my husband would say, why are you yelling.
[LAUGH]
And its just because one of the things that we have is you know they're hard of hearing.
Not only are they elderly but they were in the military, they didn't wear ear protection.
Yeah.
Whentheywere,you know,ontheir airplanes or directing air traffic or had their, you know, military training, so, one is just
being able to communicate with them.
we also not, not only have that, but some of our patients don't read very well.
So when you have a combination of I can't hear very well and I can't read very well, you really have to be innovative with how you are providing your instructions.
Mm-hm.
So like when I'm going through their medications I, if, you know, I'll, I'll, I'll ask them to read it to me, and if they can't I'll be like, can you
match up the letters, and then I'll use like a sun for the morning and a moon for the night for when they need to take it.
So just being innovative on the ways you need to prac, the, you know, just on how you communicate with them.
And then the other thing I would say is that a lot of the times with the, the older generation, the wives like to take over for their husbands for their medications, which is understandable, and very helpful especially with patients
that have cognitive impairment.
but when their wives pass away, it, it's hard for them to take care of themselves.
Yeah,I bet.
Whentheyhavehad someonethereto do it for them for so long.
Yeah.
So,that'sanotherchallengethat we have.
And another challenge where like, the social workers are incredibly helpful there at the
VA, because they can help us tap community resources to get nursing to come into their home for maybe a month or two until they get their medication regimen under control and regulated.
So they can just have a better understanding of what they're, what they're going to do.
Yeah.
Well, we talked about the importance of communication in our course, or, or we will be but that, this kind of takes, takes that to the next level in terms of how do I, how can, can they hear, can they read?
Yeah.
Cantheycommun, how can we translate this in a way that makes sense?
Andthenthemildcog, like the cognitive impairment that comes along sometimes with aging, too.
Yeah.
So,it'sjust,Icantellyou15 different times of, kinds of pillboxes and alarmed pillboxes, and locked with alarms.
And you know, sometimes even with that I have patients that'll say, yeah, I heard a beeping, but I couldn't remember what I was supposed to do, so it's.
Mm-hm.
So we got tools, and we have resources in the community needed to pull those in.
Yeah,right.
Well,Angieyourpracticeisreally interesting.
I hope that our viewers have learned, you know, kind of a different aspect of pharmacy where, where this might be more of what the future may look like and it's.
Ihopeso .
Andwe'll,andwe'llseethat.
Yeah.
So,thanksfordoingthis .
Yeah.
Sharingyourpracticewithus.
Anytime.
Goodluckto youinthefuture.
Thankyou.

Oi!
Nathan!
NATHAN!
What are you doing up there?
Come down.
Fucking knob.
My name's Daniel, I'm 17 and I live on a farm in Dunt...
I'm gonna give it ten seconds before the timer goes off.
..I live with my mum, my little sister Julia, my brothers Tyson and Jamie...
Can we get a smile, dickheads?
..and my other brother Nathan.
Nathan, be careful!
Nathan's my identical twin brother.
He's a tripper.
He's deaf, he's a little bit retarded too.
Nathan!
Nath lost his hearing in this explosives accident when he was little and we did this thing, right, where we had an operation where I had to give him one of my eardrums.
Fuck you!
But it fucked up.
Like, it didn't work and started getting shit again.
When we were little, we're, like, me and Nath, we were good mates.
Like, we'd wear the same clothes and we were in the same footy team.
We were just, like, inseparable.
But as we got more, like, teenagers, you can...
We went a bit more different.
Like, I'm better at school, I've got more mates than him, get more chicks than him and, like,
I'm a better bloke than him in a lot of ways.
Like, Nath, like, he's always doing weird shit and stuff.
Oi, Nathan!
What are you doing?
Our farm is 180 acres but, like, it's pretty shit.
But my dad, he died in this car crash when we was 11 and he had this, like, dream that he wanted to make it into, like, a really successful farm.
Nathan!
So me and Nath, like, we finish school this year and we're gonna work on it together and we're gonna, like, finish off his dream.
Well, this is the sign that I made.
We're gonna call the whole thing Danthan Industries
it's the 'Than' from 'Nathan' so you put it together - 'Danthan'.
Well, it's Danthan 'cause 'Nathan'.
Oh, yeah, then there's Steve.
Hey, fellas.
He's my mum's new boyfriend.
He's a fucking dickhead.
You boys should get outside, it's a beautiful day.
We ARE outside, dickhead.
Oh, he's a fucking knob.
He's always trying to get us involved in shit.
Like, 'Oh, hey, boys, I'm gonna go...
D'you wanna go out on the bikes together?
' and shit.
The other day, he's like, 'Oh, let's go huntin', let's go huntin'.'
Like, we don't fucking go hunting, mate.
Hey, Stevie, Stevie.
Yeah?
Yeah, mate?
Footy?
Yeah, come on, mate.
Catch this.
Oh!
(Mum sighs) Daniel.
You dropped it, you get it.
Be polite.
Oh, never mind.
Come inside and have coffee.
Nath.
I'm Jessie, I'm serving 18 months for breaking and entering.
Um, my name's Clinton, age 14, serving nine months for assault.
13, serving three years for manslaughter.
We're a detention facility for boys ten to 18 years of age.
The boys are serving time for different offences.
These are the bad boys, the worst boys in the State.
We have 60 to 80 boys detained here at any one time and security is pretty tight because, look, a lot of these boys are considered a genuine threat to society.
In a jail, any jail, there's a food chain, the hierarchy.
At the bottom is our inmates...
Hats off, boys.
..and at the top it has to be us, the staff.
But at the top of our food chain, it's Gran.
Get in there, you little shithead.
Sweet dreams.
Gran's been here for more than 25 years.
She genuinely knows the place better than any of us here.
Break it up!
Gran is a real asset to this place.
I feel so lucky to have her here,
I really don't know what we'd do without her.
You're behaving like a bunch of fucking little dickheads.
Sit in your spot there, please.
Well, if a real ratbag kid comes in, a real psychopathic style kid with all the anger issues in the world, they usually send him straight to Gran and I'll sort him out.
The boys fear me, they're frightened of me.
I can be a real fucking cow if I need to be.
Turn the fucking television off, Marlin.
GUARD:
She's got a lot more experience than we do.
She is a mother figure for these boys.
We're not going unless you give us a joke.
No jokes, I'm not in the mood for fun.
Then we're not leaving.
Alright, alright, alright, one joke.
How many juvenile offenders does it take to finish a crossword?
I don't know.
Ten.
One to get his mum to do it 'cause he can't spell and the other nine to beat the shit out of you.
Alright, all you fuckwits, out.
Gran, she can be an old cow.
Come on!
Yeah, she's, like, kinda strict, like, puts you in your place when you need to be put in your place and a racist old bitch too sometimes when she wants to be.
Get your lazy Aboriginal arse off the couch, come on.
All of you, in the yard.
Come on, Marlin.
Fucking sniffing too much petrol, up you get.
Get up!
Out, you two.
What you trying to do?
Fucking strangle me?
Out.
Even though we fight a little bit, it's all in good fun, muck around and that, we have fun.
Two teams - light skins, dark skins.
Dark skin, light skin, light skin, light skin.
You are a light skin, I know you're an Aborigine but you're a light skin.
Over there.
Over there.
Bullshit, mate.
HENNESSY:
Gran does have a habit of crossing the line.
Get the fucking ball, you faggot.
Come on, darkies, darkies!
Get it!
Get it!
Nice throw, dickhead.
There's no doubt that Gran can get a little bit out of order with her political correctness.
Kick it, negro, kick it.
Coco Pops, go get the ball.
We turn a blind eye to the way she operates at times because the bottom line for us is that she does deliver results.
Did your mum's heroin habit during pregnancy affect your coordination?
When I'm tough with the boys, I find that they...
You earn their respect.
Jesus!
The bloody goal is bigger than my arse.
Get it in.
You make an impact on them.
And we're talking about real bad boys here, bad cookies.
But I feel like I know how to treat bad boys.
Jesus, I thought wogs were good at soccer.
(Strange moaning) Oh, yuck!
What's he doing?
Oh, Nath's in there.
He's on the dunny but because he can't...
'Cause he's deaf, he can't hear himself taking the dump so he makes all these fucking sounds.
Listen to this.
(Forced moaning) Oh!
Mum!
Disgusting.
Mum, come listen to this.
I'm not interested, Daniel, leave him alone.
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
Well, he's got partial hearing so he's got, like, a little bit...
So if you yell really loud, like, if I go,
'NATHAN, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
'
Yeah.
But he, Nath, he never wants to talk, right, 'cause he reckons if he does, he sounds like a full spastic if he does and he reckons we always laugh at him which we do.
So if I go, if I...
Hey, Nath, Nath, Nath, Nath, say...
Nath...
'My name's Nathan and I'm a big deaf spaz.'
Daniel's a big deaf spaz.
(Laughs) See?
Didn't even hear it.
Did you say 'Daniel'?
But I've been, like, I've taught him to lip-read which is, like, when you watch someone's lips and you can work out what they're saying from how they move their lips so I'll go to him...
I'll go, 'Nathan, can you understand me?
'
Do you know who I am?
I'm your brother.
We do this thing...
Like, you grab a book, right, where, like, you cov...
You say something and you can cover your lips and he doesn't understand what you're saying.
Watch this, watch this.
So if I go,
'I love you, Nathan, you're the best brother in the whole world.'
No, you're not.
You're a fucking little faggot.
You're a fucking dumb arse, go fuck a dog.
See?
He doesn't get it.
So if I go, 'You're a legend'.
You're a fag.
You're the best brother in the world.
No, you're not, you're a fucking knob.
See?
He doesn't get it.
Uh, good bloke.
Faggot.
Awesome bloke.
Dick face.
But that's it, you can do a lot of shit with deaf guys.
New arrival dock B heading to security check, over.
I'm often the one the boys meet when they first arrive at the prison...
Oh, he's keen, he's popped out.
I'm Gran, I'm here to look after you.
Do you know where you are?
You're in prison.
..and that can be interesting, helping them settle in.
Things are always a little shaky on those first few days.
Crack a smile, why don't ya?
Eh?
My job description on paper is to be an officer...
Put your weight on your front foot so you'll come in.
..but I find that I'm also a sports coach,
I'm a chef...
Be careful with knifes, please, guys.
..I'm a games coordinator...
Your go, Imrad.
..I'm a psychiatrist.
I find myself counselling the boys 24/7...
You've been a bit of a mental case lately, you've got to admit.
..I become a kind of surrogate family for a lot of these boys...
Hip, hip, hooray!
..you become Mum, you become Grandma, you're the one they turn to...
High five.
Whoops, too slow.
Break it up!
Get off him!
..there's times when you shit yourself.
I'm gonna fucking...
Get down, ya!
Fucking idiot.
Fights - often we have to sort of deal with altercations with the boys where I need to sort of restrain them, get them down on the ground and you shit yourself.
You wanna spend the fucking night in iso, you're going the right way about it.
Shut the fuck up!
These are my mates - Lochi, Jayden, Black Daniel.
Yeah, he's Daniel too, same name, so we call him Black Daniel so you can tell the difference.
We're kind of the cooler crew in town.
Like, we chill together, we do stuff.
Just the river, the dam, whatever, parties, wreak havoc, basically.
Got my Ps so I can take my mum's car.
Yeah, we sort of did it up a bit.
You know, added some shit to it and that.
The Pulsar.
The Pulsee.
Pulsee.
We did mainies, just drive, like, down on Main Street.
Yeah, there's different types of mainies.
Like, you can do basic mainies which is just driving up and down and checking out what's going on, like, calling out to chicks or whatever.
Or you can do music mainies, you just pump some music and that, just full tunes blaring and that.
(Pumping rap music)
Yeah, like, back in the day, before I got my licence, we did BMX mainies, just cruise up and down, check out what's going on.
Walking mainies - that's sometimes fun too.
But having a Pulsar is fucking awesome.
ALL:
Yeah!
There's just so much shit you can do with it.
(Cheering)
Yeah, it's pretty much the fun shit that we do around town.
BOYS:
Yeah!
Daniel.
What's up?
Know anything about this?
No.
The cops, they like us 'cause we sort of keep an eye on the town...
That's weird, isn't it?
Looks like fresh.
Definitely let you know if we see anything but... ..make sure there's no trouble and that.
Catch ya!
If anything's going on, we pretty much know about it.
Nathan!
What are you doing?
He's a fucking knob.
Nath always pisses on the bottle shop sign 'cause he hates the guy that owns the bottle shop.
Nath's not fully in our crew.
Like, he's not really one of our mates.
Yeah, it's 'cause he's a knob.
Yeah.
We don't like him 'cause he goes psycho like that.
He kicked Lochi in the nuts once.
Yeah, 'cause you laughed at him 'cause Nath accidentally went in the girls' dunnies.
Yeah, come on, it's funny.
Yeah, but you...
You laughed to the point that it made him aggro so now, whenever Nath sees Lochi, he's always threatening to kick him in the nuts.
Go home, Nathan!
Go back to the girls' dunnies!
Shut up.
Those boys on kitchen duty should be in the kitchen now.
Come on, dickheads.
Hey, Gran, can we get ice-cream tonight?
Ice-cream?
No idea.
That sucks.
Come on!
How about we use your eight ball and find out?
Magic eight ball, come on.
Alright, let's do it.
Yes!
Here we go.
Will we have ice-cream tonight?
Just say yes.
Come on, yes.
Yes.
Signs point to yes.
(Both cheer)
Alright, get in the kitchen, fuckwits!
BOYS: ã Ice-cream... ã
A lot of these boys can be quite unhappy.
While they're on the inside, they can be depressed, they can be angry so I find that I like to lighten things up a little bit.
This is Big Brother.
Come to the Diary Room, please, Christian.
I find that it can help them take their mind off their worries.
They love it when I do that.
He's looking.
Yeah, no, Gran's joke's awesome.
It's funny as.
Yeah, she does these practical jokes.
It's called Gran's Gotchas.
If she ever gets you, it's like, 'Ah, shit!
'
Just, fucks around with you, know what I mean?
Hey, Trent, we just found out that you're getting an early release.
Congratulations.
So congratulations.
You'll be going home this afternoon.
Well done.
Let's go pack your bags and get you out of here.
Now, where's Mum?
Mum should be here somewhere.
Uh, Trent, I just wanted to say before you go... ..gotcha.
(Boys laugh)
You got another nine months in here, we're not letting you out.
Have you guys heard about the escape tunnel in Block E?
What?
Gotcha.
Marcus has just come back from court.
Go easy on him, he's just found out he's going to get the electric chair.
Sweet...
That's fucked up.
Gotcha. (Laughs) That ain't funny.
That's not even funny.
A lot of these guys are missing out on things while they're on the inside, they miss out on parties, socials, discos, that sort of thing.
Right, take a seat, guys.
This is Friday Night Song Night, as you know.
So what I like to do is keep them as distracted as possible and I like to keep them entertained.
ã I tried to make them go to rehab ã I won't go, go, go... ã ã You took a sip, just a sip from the devil's cup ã Just who do you think you are?
ã Take it like a man, baby, if that's what you are... ã ã 25 years and my life is still ã Trying to get up that great big hill of hope... ã ã Moving on up, moving on out
ã Time to break free ã Nothing can stop me... ã
This is Friday Night Song Night.
I'm Gran.
Take the mark...
Ready?
Yep, go.
Do another one, straight in, another one.
Yeah, I like to update my profile pic, like, once or twice a fortnight.
Fuck off, I'm gonna do some mirror ones.
These are some of me old profile pics.
Balloon head.
That's this tatt that I wanna get.
Pussy fingers.
I'll show you Nath's.
Profile pic - he's had that one up for ages, actually.
These are his other ones.
He does heaps of this.
And his pussy fingers too - he ripped that off me.
I started doing that first.
Like, at our school, I invented that.
Hey, Nath.
Nath, when are you gonna change your profile pic?
You've had that up for ages, mate.
Nath!
NATHAN!
Profile pic, mate.
What are you changing it?
Fuck off.
We're into, like, skating, surf and that.
Nath's more skating, he's into skating, he's, like, pretty good at it, he can do tricks and shit.
I'm more surfing and so, yeah, I'm getting pretty good at that.
On the dam and that.
Music-wise, we're into hip-hop so me and Nath, you know, we do a bit of shit together -
I MC, he beat-boxes.
ã School is shit, I really hate it ã The teachers are gay ã Hey, hey, hey... ã
I do a fair bit of freestyle stuff so just whatever comes to your head.
I don't like to plan it too much, I don't like writing shit down but I've just pretty much got an ear for rhyming and that.
ã My car is a manual My name is Daniel... ã
Oh, this is my Wall Of Legends.
This is pretty much everyone who I consider an absolute legend.
So, the main ones, you got my dad - that's my dad.
You got my gran, um, you got Blake Oakfield.
He's this legendary surfer, he's retired now but he was an absolute legend back in the day.
Um, Smouse - me and Nath's favourite rapper.
We just love all his shit.
And then Emily Chase, she's this legendary hot chick that me and Nath are really into.
Nath's got his own Wall Of Legends too, don't you, Nath?
This is his.
Emily...
Is she a legend?
Yeah.
So we're into similar shit.
You just got to express yourself in your own bedroom.
Well, this is home for us here.
It's...
We're on prison grounds and I've been here for about 14 years now which is, you know, it's flying by.
I live here with Penny who's another officer in the prison.
The boys call her Legs because she's nearly seven feet tall, which is just a funny nickname they've come up with.
But you don't mind it.
I don't mind it, no, no.
I did at first but no, it's fine now.
It's not teasing, it's just, it's a nickname.
The house does come with the job so when Gran retires, we may not be able to stay.
We don't need to think about that now so...
Live in the moment.
Well, these are my guinea pigs.
I've got 23 adults here and six young.
I just love them, they're a lovely animal.
And this is my pride and joy, this is my Kerri-Anne.
She's the one that Penny gave me five or six years ago and got the whole craze started and she's a wonderful-looking beast.
I did have a guinea pig in my bed once a few years ago and I unfortunately rolled on it and it did die so that's...
We learned our lesson, there.
So I wouldn't risk it with Kerri-Anne.
I pop her down on a lovely cushioned surface like this and then this is the brush I use and you watch her face when I start grooming.
She loves it.
See the face there?
Yeah, so this is the transportation cage 'cause I do take Kerri-Anne over to the prison from time to time.
What I do is I'll use the kitty litter and it's more expensive.
That's a kitty litter there which is just a compressed paper product and what that does is when they urinate, it gets rid of any odours.
Princess Mary, I've had for four years now.
We can see, another great face there.
Well, once a week, I get the boys involved in pig duty...
Hi, fellas.
..it's where I choose a responsible duo from the prison, they come over and they help me tend to the guinea pigs.
The boys are here for pig duty.
We've got carrots.
Carrots.
They know I love them and they love them too.
Thin layer on top there.
I do have names for all of them.
I never forget a guinea pig once I've named them.
Pauline, Patch, Lucy, Henry, Fudge, Norelle, Jaffles, Kerri-Anne,
Ken, Ruffles, Princess Mary, Courtney, Keith, Pia and the babies,
Trizzy, we got Joyce, we've got Darrell and Sonia, we've got Ratty, we've Bok Choy and we've got Parsley.
Hmm.
Daniel, can you come and get on the end of this?
I found out today that Steve's moving in.
Like, he's fully brought all his shit and he's, like, gonna be sleeping in my mum's bed and shit.
Daniel!
Mum didn't even ask us about it.
Just, like, turns up, Mum's like, 'Oh, yeah, Steve's moving in.'
Hey, saw you down the main street in your mum's car, mate.
Be careful, eh?
Daniel, if you're not gonna be responsible...
I wasn't doing anything!
..with my car, you can't borrow it.
The worst thing is, like, he's moving his dog Marcos into the house too.
Such a fucking fag dog.
I mean, look at it.
His name's Marcos but I call it Fuckos.
Hey, Fuckos.
Fuckos, come here.
Come here, Fuckos.
See?
Knows its name.
You know your name, don't ya?
Your name's Fuckos.
You can tell it's a fag dog, right?
'Cause fag dogs, like, when they walk, see its arse?
Sort of wiggles its bum when it walks, like this.
See that?
That's, like, to attract other male dogs.
Oh, and the other thing is...
See this?
Like, on a, like, a straight dog, it'd be sort of bushy and that but on a fag dog, you can see its nuts.
Hey, Steve, can we take Marcos?
Yeah.
Can we play with Marcos?
Yeah, sure, mate.
Nath, grab Marcos.
Hey, Stevie!
This one's for you.
Daniel!
You, idiot!
Welcome to the family, Stevie!
Right, where's my Hulk?
Imran, Spiderman.
Superman.
Jamies on, guys.
They should be lovely and warm, they've just come out of the dryer.
These are the special jamies that I do for the boys.
They're just a lightweight sleepwear fabric that I sort of work up into the various superhero designs.
Once you've got your jamies on, into cells, please, guys.
We've got Shrek here.
This is the zebra from Madagascar.
We also have the Power Ranger, the purple Power Ranger.
Pyjamas on!
In cells, please!
I also do a matching doona cover too.
This is the Superman doona, the boys are really into it.
If you could move over, Marlin, and show them the design that I've done there.
I do all my own sewing and stuff myself at home.
Off, please.
Show them the S.
That's the Superman design and he's got the - if you could turn around - the cape on the back there.
That's just a press-stud cape that he chooses to wear.
Takes it off when he sleeps.
But, yeah, the boys really get into it.
I'll just find you some bottoms.
I mean, some of the guys just, you know, they think they're too cool for it or whatever.
Can't tempt you with the Power Ranger jamies, Mohammed?
No?
It keeps me busy and it keeps the boys happy.
Settle down, heroes.
Lights out.
We get the boys in at 8:30 and that can often be the hardest time.
Mohammed?
Come and grab some tissues, mate.
They've done phone calls to loved ones and looking at photos and whatnot and they can become quite teary and that's why I keep these - my tissues.
Have some tissues.
But if the tears continue, I do go in and I offer some comfort to them and a couple of tissues and a pat on the back and that sort of thing.
Aw, you poor thing, you poor thing.
Oh, it's not much fun in here, is it?
Yeah, people often say, 'Gran, you forget what these boys have done.'
You know?
Some of these boys have done horrible, horrible things.
Things that would make you sick to the stomach.
And they may be the worst boys in the State but they're still boys.
Robin would think Batman was a big poof if he cried that much.
Come on, you'll be right.
Have some tissues.
OK, right.
Yep, I see.
Well, we heard back from the hearing specialist this afternoon and unfortunately Nathan's tests have shown that he isn't going to get any better.
His hearing is in fact going to get worse...
Look, thank you very much for the call.
..so they say that in a couple of months, he'll be completely deaf which they call that profoundly deaf.
He's not going to be able to have the cochlear implant that we were hoping might be a possibility.
Oh, that's real bad news.
Hmm, I know.
Daniel, what are you laughing at?
Oh, no, just the way you said 'cochlear'...
Daniel, grow up.
You said Nathan's cochlear.
This is really serious.
Well, don't say 'cochlear' if you don't want me to laugh.
Have a little bit more sensitivity, will you?
Of course I'm gonna laugh if you say that.
Oh, God!
You're so childish at times.
That's a real shame, isn't it?
Yeah, they reckon he might be fully deaf within a few months.
Oh, how's your old bitch of a mother about it all?
Yeah, she's alright.
Her boyfriend moved in today.
Oh?
That was quick.
Yeah.
He sounds like an absolute dickhead from what you've told me.
Yeah, he is one.
Hi, Nathan.
I can see you.
Nath, Gran says hi!
Oi!
Don't be cheeky.
Piss off, you fucking dickhead.
Steve, give me the remote.
Give me the...
I'm going to bed so that needs to be on 22 at all times, alright?
22, no louder, OK?
Got it?
Fair enough.
Now, Nathan, watch my lips.
Now, you be good, try your hardest at school and don't get into trouble.
OK, goodnight.
Let's do our Eskimo kiss.
Thanks, sweetheart.
Alright, night-night.
Be good.
Goodnight.
STEVE:
You're off to bed, Nathan?
Nath, say goodnight to Steve.
Goodnight.
Middle finger down, please, mate.
Nathan, down.
Hey, Steve, what's four minus three?
Daniel, grow up.
NATHAN!
Nathan, Daniel wants you.
Nath, Nath, Nath, you're a legend.
You're a fag.
You're the best brother ever.
No, you're not, you're a fucking dickhead.
Awesome brother.

They could arrest him unless we agree to let the welfare people come over.
They came up with this bullshit idea of sending Nath to a deaf school.
He said he doesn't wanna go.

No kidding.

Some childhood dream about you making him hit himself.
What childhood?
That was last week.
Sports Center?
Yeah.
I'm making my picks for tomorrow's games.
Really, Charlie?
Taking the points against Georgetown?
No.
If you want to throw your money away, why don't you just get married without a prenup.
You know something I don't?
So far this year, Georgetown's covered the spread eight times out of ten.
Wow, you bet college basketball?
Only idiots bet college basketball.
No offense.
Then how do you know all this stuff?
I worked for a sports book in Vegas.
Then I opened my own little business in the back of a candle shop in Sherman Oaks.
I always wondered how those places stayed in business.
Yeah, so did the IRS.
So they nailed you for running a book?
No.
They nailed me for running a candle store that made a quarter of a million dollars a year without selling one freakin' candle.
Okay, so no on Georgetown.
Does Alan know about this?
He knows about the candle store.
Let's just keep the other part between us.
Yeah, he's kind of prissy about moral stuff like gambling.
Yeah, he is.
And drinking.
Well, that's only because when he drinks, he gets all weepy and then he pukes.
And whoring.
No, he doesn't have a moral problem with that.
He's just cheap and he likes to cuddle.
Well, don't worry-- your sordid gambling past will be our secret.
I'm glad to know I can trust you.
Well, of course you can.
Hey, I never told him about your little soft-core film career.

Although I am very familiar with the bakery shop scene in the middle.
You know, with the frosting gun?
I was 19, I needed the money.
They promised me it would be tasteful.
It looked very tasteful.
And delicious.
Yum, yum.
Glad to hear you enjoyed it.
Oh, yeah.
Although I don't think you were well-served by the screenplay.
What screenplay?
There was just a greasy little guy behind the camera saying, "Do this, do that.
More frosting."
It's kind of weird.
In some way, you and I have more in common than you and my brother.
All right, let's take something off the table right away.
What's that?
My ass.
That's not what I was getting at...
Seriously, Charlie, in spite of my past,
I'm just a nice little Valley soccer mom now.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, soccer mom?
Your kid's a babbling pothead.
He played soccer when he was ten.
He scored two goals.
In one game?
In one season.
Shut up.
The point is,
I am way past guys like you.
What do you mean guys like me?
I mean guys that I have to dip in ammonia before I'd let them anywhere near me.
Oh.
Those guys.
Well, as long as we're being honest,
I'm perfectly happy with the way things are between us.
Besides, you're really good for Alan.
Thank you.
Yeah, yeah, no, y-you're, you're smart, you're strong, you're self-sufficient, and he's, well... not.
I think you underestimate your brother.
It's not an estimate.
I already got the bill.
You'll see, one of these days he's gonna surprise you.
And one of these days I'm gonna die of liver failure.
Want to lay odds which happens first?
Good night, Charlie.

No reason.

Don't worry, she's leaving very soon.
I'm not worried.
Actually, I like having her around.
You not so much.
Thank you.
That never ceases to be funny.
Ah, cinnamon buns!

I bought them.

Alan bought cinnamon buns.
With frosting.
Oh.

All right, honey.
I'll see you later.
Oh.
I'll call you after work.
See ya, Charlie.
Hey, Lynds, has your son picked a college yet?
Uh, no.
Why?
Well, I was just wondering if he were to choose between say...
North Carolina and Kentucky which one would you encourage him to pick?
Keeping in mind that as an out-of-state resident,
Kentucky is two-and-a-half times more expensive.
I'd still go with Kentucky.
It's a better school.
Interesting.
Well, I hope he gets in.
Thanks.
Bye.
Bye.
What was that all about?
Hmm?
Since when do you care about her kid's education?
Young people are our future, Alan.
I care about them all.
Oh, please.
The only young people you care about are sliding down a pole to grab dollar bills out of your mouth.
Those aren't dollar bills-- those are 20s.
And when did you become such a cynic?
And when did you become so interested in the comings and goings of my girlfriend-- or what her kid's up to?
Whoa, whoa, chill.
No, no, I will not chill.
And what was all that about liking having her around?
Nothing.
I like having her around.
Yeah, but around what?
Excuse me?
I think when you say "around," you mean under.
Don't go down that road, Alan.
Oh, oh, why shouldn't I go down that road?
Is it slippery when wet?
Are you out of your mind?
What's gotten into you?
Oh, I think a better question would be what's gotten into you?
I mean, who have you gotten into?
Alan, Alan, listen to me very carefully.
I have not had sex with your girlfriend.
Oh, so it's still in the planning stages.
No.
But you do want her?
No.
Why not?
What's wrong with her?
Nothing.
She's terrific.
So you do want her!
Alan, believe me, when it comes to Lyndsey, you have absolutely nothing to worry about.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
That's what you said about Wendy Freidman and Kathy Bell and Amy Driskell.
Who?
They're all girls that you stole from me.
What are you talking about?
I never stole anybody from you.
Wendy Freidman.
Sixth grade, Halloween party.
I went to get her punch.
When I came back, you were bobbing for her apples.
Innocent fun.
Oh...
Kathy Bell, ninth grade.
I brought her home to work on our science project.
I went to the bathroom.
When I came back, you were teaching her French.
Harmless horseplay.
Amy Driskell, sophomore year.
First girl who let me get to second base.
All right, her I nailed.
Wait, wait, wait.
You nailed her?
Everybody nailed her.
That was her thing.
It took me six months just to touch her right boob!
Wow, you really missed the signals, didn't you?
What signals?
Well, in my case, it was her taking off her sweater and saying, "Quick, do me before Alan gets back from his trumpet lesson."
Clarinet.
I didn't have the lip for trumpet.
Apparently, you didn't have the lip for Amy Driskell, either.
But all that was a long time ago.
You're with Lyndsey now, and what's important is that I wish you both a long and happy life together.
Really?
From the bottom of my heart.
Okay.
Thank you.
You're welcome.

You can help me with the guest list.
Okay.
What would you say about inviting
Judith and Herb?
My ex-wife?
They live right across the street, and Herb is always so sweet to me.
That's because every time Herb looks at you, he's pretending you're wet and naked.

Are you saying you don't trust me?
Oh, no, no, no, I don't trust Charlie.
For him, you're unexplored territory.
At some point, he's gonna try and plant his flag in you.
And when I say "flag," I mean his flag.
Okay, you're out of your mind.
Yeah, well, be that as it may,
I do not want you hanging out with my brother.
I mean, you know, you can be courteous to him.
You know, like, "Hey, Charlie, you got some vomit on your shoe,"
or, you know, "Hey, Charlie, do you need me to move my car so your hooker can park her pink Camaro?"
Do you realize how insulting this is?
You don't get to tell me who I can and can't be friends with.
Hey, it's just Charlie.
I gave you Herb and Berta.
You know what, I made a mistake.
Well, I forgive you.
Give me my key back.

Hey, what are you doing up?
Your brother's talking in his sleep again.
No kidding.
What about?
Some childhood dream about you making him hit himself.
What childhood?
That was last week.
SportsCenter?
Yeah, I'm making my picks for tomorrow's games.
Really, Charlie?
Taking the points against Georgetown?
No?
If you wanna throw your money away, just get married without a prenup.
You know something I don't?
So far this year...
Georgetown's covered the spread eight times out of ten.
- Wow.
You bet college basketball?
- Only idiots bet college basketball.
- No offense.
- How do you know this stuff?
I worked for a sports book in Vegas.
I opened my business... in the back of a candle shop in Sherman Oaks.
I wondered how those stayed in business.
Yeah, so did the IRS.
So they nailed you for running a book?
No, a candle store that made a quarter of a million dollars a year.
Without selling one freaking candle.
Okay, so no on Georgetown.
Does Alan know about this?
He knows about the candle store.
Let's keep the other part between us.
Yeah, he's kind of prissy about moral stuff like gambling.
- Yeah, he is.
- And drinking.
That's only because when he drinks, he gets all weepy, then he pukes.
- And whoring.
- He doesn't have a problem with that.
He's just cheap and he likes to cuddle.
Well, don't worry, your sordid gambling past will be our secret.
- I'm glad to know I can trust you.
- Of course, you can.
Hey, I never told him about your little soft-core film career.
Oh, God.
You saw Cinnamon's Buns?
Not all the way through.
Though I am very familiar... with the bakery-shop scene in the middle.
You know, with the frosting gun.
I was 19.
I needed the money.
They promised me it would be tasteful.
It looked very tasteful.
And delicious.
Yum, yum.
Glad to hear you enjoyed it.
Yeah.
I don't think you were well-served by the screenplay.
Screenplay?
There was just a greasy guy behind the camera:
"Do this, do that, more frosting."
[CHUCKLING]
It's kind of weird.
You and I have more in common than you and my brother.
All right, let's take something off the table right away.
- What's that?
- My ass.
- That's not what I was getting at.
- Charlie... in spite of my past, I'm just a nice little Valley soccer mom now.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Soccer mom?
Your kid's a babbling pothead.
He played soccer when he was ten.
He scored two goals.
- In one game?
- In one season.
Shut up.
The point is I am way past guys like you.
[SCOFFS]
What do you mean, "guys like me"?
Guys I'd have to dip in ammonia before I'd let them anywhere near me.
Oh, those guys.
Long as we're being honest, I am happy with the way things are between us.
Besides, you're really good for Alan.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, yeah, no.
You're smart, you're strong, you're self-sufficient... and he's, well, not.
You underestimate your brother.
It's not an estimate.
I already got the bill.
You'll see.
One of these days, he's gonna surprise you.
One of these days, I'm gonna die of liver failure.
Wanna lay odds which happens first?
[LAUGHS]
- Good night, Charlie.
- Good night.
Ammonia?
- Am I that skeevy?
LYNDSEY:
Yes.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
- Lyndsey leave yet?
- No.
Why?
No reason.
Just trying to keep track of who's in my house.
Don't worry, she's leaving very soon.
I'm not worried.
Actually, I like having her around.
You, not so much.
Thank you.
That never ceases to be funny.
Ah!
Cinnamon buns.
- How did you know?
- I bought them.
Oh, right.
Cinnamon buns.
Who doesn't love cinnamon buns?
Ugh!
Charlie.
What, what?
Alan bought cinnamon buns.
With frosting.
Oh!
Yum.
All right, honey, I'll see you later.
- I'll call you after work.
- See you.
Hey, Lynds, has your son picked a college yet?
Uh, no.
Why?
Well, I was just wondering... if he were to choose between, say...
North Carolina and Kentucky... which would you encourage him to pick?
As an out-of-state resident...
Kentucky is two and a half times more expensive.
I'd still go with Kentucky.
It's a better school.
Interesting.
Well, I hope he gets in.
- Thanks.
Bye.
- Bye.
- What was that all about?
- Hmm?
Since when do you care about her kid's education?
Young people are our future, Alan.
I care about them all.
The only young people you care about... are sliding down a pole to grab dollar bills out of your mouth.
Those aren't dollar bills.
Those are twenties.
- When did you become a cynic?
- When did you... become so interested in the comings and goings of my girlfriend?
Or her kid?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Chill.
- I will not chill.
And what was all that about liking having her around?
- Nothing.
I like having her around.
- Yeah, but around what?
- Excuse me?
- I think when you say "around"... you mean "under."
- Don't go down that road.
- Why shouldn't I go down that road?
Is it slippery when wet?
Are you out of your mind?
What's gotten into you?
I think a better question would be, what's gotten into you?
I mean, who have you gotten into?
Alan, Alan, listen to me very carefully.
I have not had sex with your girlfriend.
- Still in the planning stages.
- No.
- But you want her.
- No.
- Why not?
What's wrong with her?
- Nothing.
She's terrific.
So you do want her.
When it comes to Lyndsey... you have absolutely nothing to worry about.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
That's what you said about Wendy Freidman... and Kathy Bell and Amy Driskell.
- Who?
- They're all girls you stole from me.
What?
I never stole anybody from you.
Ha, ha.
Wendy Freidman, sixth grade, Halloween party.
I went to get her punch, when I came back, you were bobbing for her apples.
- Innocent fun.
- Ha!
Kathy Bell, ninth grade.
I brought her home.
I went to the bathroom.
When I come back, you were teaching her French.
Harmless horseplay.
Amy Driskell, sophomore year.
First girl who let me get to second base.
All right, her I nailed.
Wait, wait.
Wait.
You nailed her?
Everybody nailed her.
That was her thing.
It took me six months just to touch her right boob.
- You missed the signals, didn't you?
- What signals?
In my case, taking off her sweater and saying:
"Quick, do me before Alan gets back from his trumpet lesson."
Clarinet.
I didn't have the lip for trumpet.
Apparently, you didn't have the lip for Amy either.
But all that was a long time ago.
You're with Lyndsey now.
What's important is that I wish you both a long and happy life together.
- Really?
- From the bottom of my heart.
- Okay.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Though, I'd still like you to move out.
Got it.
- Soon.
- Right.
No, I guess that's about it.
Amy Driskell.
"No, Alan, I'm saving myself for Jesus."
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Come on in.
Hey.
- Wow!
The place looks great.
- Doesn't it?
Even better than before I accidentally almost burned it to the ground.
Yeah.
You're welcome.
Come here.
I wanna give you something.
Oh, heh.
Fooling around?
On the new couch?
Get your mind out of the gutter.
I haven't Scotchgarded yet.
Here.
- A house key?
- Uh-huh.
For this house?
Maybe we're not ready to move in together...
I want you to feel like you can come and go without checking in with me.
Wow.
Thank you.
In a lot of ways, this isn't just the key to your house... it's the key to your heart.
Don't gay it up.
Listen, I'm thinking of having a housewarming party next Saturday.
- Great.
What can I do?
- You can help me with the guest list.
What would you say about inviting Judith and Herb?
- My ex?
- They live across the street...
Herb is always so sweet to me.
Every time Herb looks at you he's pretending you're wet and naked.
All right, fine, I won't invite them.
Probably just upset Judith anyway.
Yeah, you're right.
You know what?
Let's invite them.
- Take the high road.
- All right.
- What about Berta?
- Oh, no, I don't think so.
- Why not?
- She's kind of mean to me.
Honey, that's just because she doesn't like you.
Fine.
Berta.
- And Jake.
- Oh, of course.
Great.
- And Charlie.
- There it is.
- There what is?
- Charlie.
Why do you want Charlie to come to your party?
Why?
When this place burned, he took us in.
He took me in seven years ago, I don't feel the need to invite him.
Oh, come on, he's a great guy.
I really like him.
- Of course.
All the women like Charlie.
- All the women?
Wendy Freidman, Kathy Bell, Amy Driskell.
- Who?
- And now Lyndsey MacElroy.
Oh, please.
Charlie and I are just friends.
No, no.
My brother does not befriend women, he befouls them.
Are you saying you don't trust me?
No.
I don't trust Charlie.
For him, you're unexplored territory.
At some point, he's gonna try and plant his flag in you.
And when I say "flag," I mean his:
Flag.
Okay.
You're out of your mind.
I do not want you hanging out with my brother.
You can be courteous to him.
Like, "Hey.
You've got some vomit on your shoe."
Or "Hey, Charlie, do you need me to move my car... so your hooker can park her pink Camaro?"
Do you realize how insulting this is?
You don't get to tell me who I can be friends with.
It's just Charlie.
I gave you Herb and Berta.
- You know what, I made a mistake.
- Well, I forgive you.
- Give me my key back.
- What?
- Give it to me.
- How can I come and go?
You could forget coming.
You're just gonna be going.
We were doing so good.
We were.
Then you started talking and spoiled it.
Wait.
Okay, okay.
Just to clarify.
You're not as angry with me now as you were when I burned down your house.
Okay, we'll talk after you've gained some perspective.
Jake, Berta, let's go.
Party train's leaving.
That what you're wearing?
- I'm not going.
- Well, why not?
- She and I had a little argument.
- That's too bad.
Jake, Berta, let's go.
Charlie, if you do what I think you're gonna do...
I swear to God, I will never speak to you again.
Really?
Then by all means, tell me exactly what you think I'm gonna do.
You know what I'm talking about.
All right, I'm gonna run this down for you one last time.
I have no interest in Lyndsey... and she has even less interest in me.
- I don't believe you.
You're right.
I'm going to your girlfriend's house.
- I'm gonna do her on the couch.
- No, you won't.
- Why not?
- Couch isn't Scotchgarded yet.
You remember to get the housewarming gift?
Jake's got it.
Jake.
- Very funny.
- We thought so.
Ha.
- How come you're not dressed?
- He and Lyndsey had a fight.
Oh.
That sucks.
See you.
- So you're just gonna sit here all night?
- Oh, I'll be fine.
Oh, I'm sure you will, but if you get bored... there's a load of laundry in the dryer you could fluff and fold.
- So you want me to do your job?
- Somebody has to.
Well, I guess there's nothing left to say except... you're an idiot.
I may be an idiot, but at least I'm home by myself reading Moby Dick.
Upside-down.
[DRYER BUZZES]
Might as well.
Maybe she'll like me better.
Where's Eldridge?
He lives here, right?
- Yeah.
He's hiding in his room.
- How come?
He gets really paranoid when he's "highding" in his room.
I just came to get him these snacks.
Bye.
Amateurs.
- Nice party.
- Thanks.
So give me the lay of the land.
You mean who in this land can you lay?
If you will.
All right.
Hot redhead by the bar.
That's Wanda.
Recently came out of a terrible marriage.
Nice, nice.
What else you got?
Pretty blond on the couch.
That's Terry.
She divorced her husband to be a lesbian.
How's that working out for Terry?
See the dirty look she's giving Wanda?
Oh.
I think I see an opening.
And by that you mean?
I wasn't being subtle.
I see an opening.
[LAUGHING]
I knew it.
Anything good in my life, you have to take it away.
"Oh, Charlie, you're so funny and so clever."
"Why don't I lean... so you can look down my dress and see my boobies?"
[AS CHARLIE] "Why, thank you.
I believe I will."
[IN NORMAL VOICE] "So do you wanna have sex now... or wait until after the party?"
[AS CHARLIE] "You don't mind I'm carrying most, if not all... communicable diseases known to man?"
[IN NORMAL VOICE] "No.
That's part of your charm."
"Come, take me on the couch."
[AS CHARLIE] "Are you sure?
It's not Scotchgarded."
"No matter.
We'll Scotchgard it with our love."
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Hello, Mr. Skunk.
Don't be alarmed.
I was just leaving.
There's certainly no reason to feel threatened.
Good skunk.
Nice skunk.
[GAGGING]
Bad skunk.
Ahh!
Oh, God, Oh, God.
[GAGGING]
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
HERB:
Who's out there?
- Alan?
- Oh.
Hey, Herb.
Oh!
Oh, wow!
Hope you don't mind.
I got skunked.
You sure did.
How come you're not at Lyndsey's party?
I wanted to, but Judith came down with a sudden migraine.
And by "migraine," I mean "bitch fit."
- Got it.
- How about you?
Lyndsey and I had kind of a falling out.
Because you showed up smelling like a skunk?
- No, no.
It's a long story.
- I got time.
I think she's fooling around with Charlie behind my back.
Charlie?
That lucky duck.
- What?
- I said, that son of a bitch.
Story of my life.
Wendy Freidman, Kathy Bell, Amy Driskell.
Amy Driskell?
I lost my virginity to Amy Driskell.
- You're kidding.
- Never even had to ask.
[GROANING]
Our first date.
Never got out of the driveway.
We weren't even in a car.
You know what's good for getting rid of skunk smell?
Tomato juice.
- Great.
You got any?
- No.
- We might have some V8.
- Think that'll work?
Well, it sure doesn't taste like tomato juice... but you couldn't possibly smell any worse.
Hang on.
What else could go wrong?
Of course.
I'm standing in dog crap.
I can't tell you how happy it makes me to bring two friends back together.
- Any better?
- Not really.
Well, that's all the V8.
- Wanna try some ketchup?
- Why not?
I found this in one of my son's shoes.
Oh, yeah.
I can get you better than this.
That's what I was hoping.
Lyndsey.
Alan?
What the hell are you...?
- Whoa!
- Where is he?
Where is who?
What is that smell?
Skunk, dog crap and ketchup.
And don't try to change the subject.
Where's my brother?
He left about 20 minutes ago with two women.
- Really?
- Really.
So you and he aren't?
That's what I've been telling you, you smelly fool.
Wow.
Guess we had nothing to fight about.
Ha, ha.
Hug?
I'll call you.
You don't scare me.
You already shot your load.
Although I suppose you could be a different skunk.
So all I'm saying is, given my history...
Alan's paranoia is not uncalled for.
No, no, this wasn't paranoia.
This was insanity.
- I know, I know...
- The man was covered in ketchup.
To be fair, there was a time in your life when you were covered in frosting.
It's not the same thing.
I was putting myself through college.
Look, all I know is that Alan really loves you.
If you repeat this, I will deny it.
My brother is the most decent human being I know.
Can't you just give him one more chance?
- Well, I suppose...
- I knew it.
You bastard.
You slut.
So, what do you say?
[English
- US
- SDH]
No, Charlie.
It's mine.
- What?
- Give it back.
Ow.
Mom, Charlie hit me.
Oh, okay.
Consuela, Charlie hit me.
Ow.
Mom, Consuela hit me.
Oh, God, here we go again.
I'll run away and then you'll be sorry.
Ow.
Mom, Charlie's making me hit myself.
Hey, what are you doing up?
Your brother's talking in his sleep again.

Come on in.
Hey.
- Wow!
The place looks great.
- Doesn't it?
Even better than before I accidentally almost burned it to the ground.
Yeah.
You're welcome.
Come here.
I wanna give you something.
Oh, heh.
Fooling around?
On the new couch?
Get your mind out of the gutter.
I haven't Scotchgarded yet.
Here.
- A house key?
- Uh-huh.
For this house?
Maybe we're not ready to move in together...
I want you to feel like you can come and go without checking in with me.
Wow.
Thank you.
In a lot of ways, this isn't just the key to your house... it's the key to your heart.
Don't gay it up.
Listen, I'm thinking of having a housewarming party next Saturday.
- Great.
What can I do?
- You can help me with the guest list.

- Oh, no, I don't think so.

- She's kind of mean to me.
Honey, that's just because she doesn't like you.
Fine.
Berta.
- And Jake.
- Oh, of course.
Great.
- And Charlie.
- There it is.
- There what is?
- Charlie.
Why do you want Charlie to come to your party?
Why?
When this place burned, he took us in.
He took me in seven years ago, I don't feel the need to invite him.
Oh, come on, he's a great guy.
I really like him.
- Of course.
All the women like Charlie.
- All the women?
Wendy Freidman, Kathy Bell, Amy Driskell.
- Who?
- And now Lyndsey MacElroy.
Oh, please.
Charlie and I are just friends.
No, no.

I gave you Herb and Berta.
- You know what, I made a mistake.
- Well, I forgive you.
- Give me my key back.
- What?
- Give it to me.
- How can I come and go?
You could forget coming.
You're just gonna be going.
We were doing so good.
We were.
Then you started talking and spoiled it.
Wait.
Okay, okay.
Just to clarify.
You're not as angry with me now as you were when I burned down your house.
Okay, we'll talk after you've gained some perspective.
Jake, Berta, let's go.
Party train's leaving.
That what you're wearing?
- I'm not going.
- Well, why not?
- She and I had a little argument.
- That's too bad.
Jake, Berta, let's go.
Charlie, if you do what I think you're gonna do...
I swear to God, I will never speak to you again.
Really?
Then by all means, tell me exactly what you think I'm gonna do.
You know what I'm talking about.
All right, I'm gonna run this down for you one last time.
I have no interest in Lyndsey... and she has even less interest in me.
- I don't believe you.
You're right.
I'm going to your girlfriend's house.
- I'm gonna do her on the couch.
- No, you won't.
- Why not?
- Couch isn't Scotchgarded yet.
You remember to get the housewarming gift?
Jake's got it.
Jake.
- Very funny.
- We thought so.
Ha.
- How come you're not dressed?
- He and Lyndsey had a fight.
Oh.
That sucks.
See you.
- So you're just gonna sit here all night?
- Oh, I'll be fine.
Oh, I'm sure you will, but if you get bored... there's a load of laundry in the dryer you could fluff and fold.
- So you want me to do your job?
- Somebody has to.
Well, I guess there's nothing left to say except... you're an idiot.
I may be an idiot, but at least I'm home by myself reading Moby Dick.
Upside-down.
Might as well.
Maybe she'll like me better.
Where's Eldridge?
He lives here, right?
- Yeah.
He's hiding in his room.
- How come?
He gets really paranoid when he's "highding" in his room.
I just came to get him these snacks.
Bye.
Amateurs.
- Nice party.
- Thanks.
So give me the lay of the land.
You mean who in this land can you lay?
If you will.
All right.
Hot redhead by the bar.
That's Wanda.
Recently came out of a terrible marriage.
Nice, nice.
What else you got?
Pretty blond on the couch.
That's Terry.
She divorced her husband to be a lesbian.
How's that working out for Terry?
See the dirty look she's giving Wanda?
Oh.
I think I see an opening.
And by that you mean?
I wasn't being subtle.
I see an opening.
I knew it.
Anything good in my life, you have to take it away.
"Oh, Charlie, you're so funny and so clever."
"Why don't I lean... so you can look down my dress and see my boobies?"
"Why, thank you.
I believe I will."
"So do you wanna have sex now... or wait until after the party?"
"You don't mind I'm carrying most, if not all... communicable diseases known to man?"
"No.
That's part of your charm."
"Come, take me on the couch."
"Are you sure?
It's not Scotchgarded."
"No matter.
We'll Scotchgard it with our love."
Hello, Mr. Skunk.
Don't be alarmed.
I was just leaving.
There's certainly no reason to feel threatened.
Good skunk.
Nice skunk.
Bad skunk.
Ahh!
Oh, God, Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Who's out there?
- Alan?
- Oh.
Hey, Herb.
Oh!
Oh, wow!
Hope you don't mind.
I got skunked.
You sure did.
How come you're not at Lyndsey's party?
I wanted to, but Judith came down with a sudden migraine.
And by "migraine," I mean "bitch fit."
- Got it.
- How about you?
Lyndsey and I had kind of a falling out.
Because you showed up smelling like a skunk?
- No, no.
It's a long story.
- I got time.
I think she's fooling around with Charlie behind my back.
Charlie?
That lucky duck.
- What?
- I said, that son of a bitch.
Story of my life.
Wendy Freidman, Kathy Bell, Amy Driskell.
Amy Driskell?
I lost my virginity to Amy Driskell.
- You're kidding.
- Never even had to ask.
Our first date.
Never got out of the driveway.
We weren't even in a car.
You know what's good for getting rid of skunk smell?
Tomato juice.
- Great.
You got any?
- No.
- We might have some V8.
- Think that'll work?
Well, it sure doesn't taste like tomato juice... but you couldn't possibly smell any worse.
Hang on.
What else could go wrong?
Of course.
I'm standing in dog crap.
I can't tell you how happy it makes me to bring two friends back together.
- Any better?
- Not really.
Well, that's all the V8.
- Wanna try some ketchup?
- Why not?
I found this in one of my son's shoes.
Oh, yeah.
I can get you better than this.
That's what I was hoping.
Lyndsey.
Alan?
What the hell are you...?
- Whoa!
- Where is he?
Where is who?
What is that smell?
Skunk, dog crap and ketchup.
And don't try to change the subject.
Where's my brother?
He left about 20 minutes ago with two women.
- Really?
- Really.
So you and he aren't?
That's what I've been telling you, you smelly fool.
Wow.
Guess we had nothing to fight about.
Ha, ha.
Hug?
I'll call you.
You don't scare me.
You already shot your load.
Although I suppose you could be a different skunk.
So all I'm saying is, given my history...
Alan's paranoia is not uncalled for.
No, no, this wasn't paranoia.
This was insanity.
- I know, I know...
- The man was covered in ketchup.
To be fair, there was a time in your life when you were covered in frosting.
It's not the same thing.
I was putting myself through college.
Look, all I know is that Alan really loves you.
If you repeat this, I will deny it.
My brother is the most decent human being I know.
Can't you just give him one more chance?
- Well, I suppose...
- I knew it.
You bastard.
You slut.
So, what do you say?
[MUMBLING]
No, Charlie.
It's mine.
- What?
- Give it back.
Ow.
Mom, Charlie hit me.
Oh, okay.
Consuela, Charlie hit me.
Ow.
Mom, Consuela hit me.
Oh, God, here we go again.
ALAN:
I'll run away and then you'll be sorry.
Ow.
Mom, Charlie's making me hit myself.
[LYNDSEY SIGHS]
Hey, what are you doing up?
Your brother's talking in his sleep again.
No kidding.
What about?
Some childhood dream about you making him hit himself.
What childhood?
That was last week.
SportsCenter?
Yeah, I'm making my picks for tomorrow's games.
Really, Charlie?
Taking the points against Georgetown?
No?
If you wanna throw your money away, just get married without a prenup.
You know something I don't?
So far this year...
Georgetown's covered the spread eight times out of ten.
- Wow.
You bet college basketball?
- Only idiots bet college basketball.
- No offense.
- How do you know this stuff?
I worked for a sports book in Vegas.
I opened my business... in the back of a candle shop in Sherman Oaks.
I wondered how those stayed in business.
Yeah, so did the IRS.
So they nailed you for running a book?
No, a candle store that made a quarter of a million dollars a year.
Without selling one freaking candle.
Okay, so no on Georgetown.
Does Alan know about this?
He knows about the candle store.
Let's keep the other part between us.
Yeah, he's kind of prissy about moral stuff like gambling.
- Yeah, he is.
- And drinking.
That's only because when he drinks, he gets all weepy, then he pukes.
- And whoring.
- He doesn't have a problem with that.
He's just cheap and he likes to cuddle.
Well, don't worry, your sordid gambling past will be our secret.
- I'm glad to know I can trust you.
- Of course, you can.
Hey, I never told him about your little soft-core film career.
Oh, God.
You saw Cinnamon's Buns?
Not all the way through.
Though I am very familiar... with the bakery-shop scene in the middle.
You know, with the frosting gun.
I was 19.
I needed the money.
They promised me it would be tasteful.
It looked very tasteful.
And delicious.
Yum, yum.
Glad to hear you enjoyed it.
Yeah.
I don't think you were well-served by the screenplay.
Screenplay?
There was just a greasy guy behind the camera:
"Do this, do that, more frosting."
[CHUCKLING]
It's kind of weird.
You and I have more in common than you and my brother.
All right, let's take something off the table right away.
- What's that?
- My ass.
- That's not what I was getting at.
- Charlie... in spite of my past, I'm just a nice little Valley soccer mom now.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Soccer mom?
Your kid's a babbling pothead.
He played soccer when he was ten.
He scored two goals.
- In one game?
- In one season.
Shut up.
The point is I am way past guys like you.
[SCOFFS]
What do you mean, "guys like me"?
Guys I'd have to dip in ammonia before I'd let them anywhere near me.
Oh, those guys.
Long as we're being honest, I am happy with the way things are between us.
Besides, you're really good for Alan.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, yeah, no.
You're smart, you're strong, you're self-sufficient... and he's, well, not.
You underestimate your brother.
It's not an estimate.
I already got the bill.
You'll see.
One of these days, he's gonna surprise you.
One of these days, I'm gonna die of liver failure.
Wanna lay odds which happens first?
[LAUGHS]
- Good night, Charlie.
- Good night.
Ammonia?
- Am I that skeevy?
LYNDSEY:
Yes.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
- Lyndsey leave yet?
- No.
Why?
No reason.
Just trying to keep track of who's in my house.
Don't worry, she's leaving very soon.
I'm not worried.
Actually, I like having her around.
You, not so much.
Thank you.
That never ceases to be funny.
Ah!
Cinnamon buns.
- How did you know?
- I bought them.
Oh, right.
Cinnamon buns.
Who doesn't love cinnamon buns?
Ugh!
Charlie.
What, what?
Alan bought cinnamon buns.
With frosting.
Oh!
Yum.
All right, honey, I'll see you later.
- I'll call you after work.
- See you.
Hey, Lynds, has your son picked a college yet?
Uh, no.
Why?
Well, I was just wondering... if he were to choose between, say...
North Carolina and Kentucky... which would you encourage him to pick?
As an out-of-state resident...
Kentucky is two and a half times more expensive.
I'd still go with Kentucky.
It's a better school.
Interesting.
Well, I hope he gets in.
- Thanks.
Bye.
- Bye.
- What was that all about?
- Hmm?
Since when do you care about her kid's education?
Young people are our future, Alan.
I care about them all.
The only young people you care about... are sliding down a pole to grab dollar bills out of your mouth.
Those aren't dollar bills.
Those are twenties.
- When did you become a cynic?
- When did you... become so interested in the comings and goings of my girlfriend?
Or her kid?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Chill.
- I will not chill.
And what was all that about liking having her around?
- Nothing.
I like having her around.
- Yeah, but around what?
- Excuse me?
- I think when you say "around"... you mean "under."
- Don't go down that road.
- Why shouldn't I go down that road?
Is it slippery when wet?
Are you out of your mind?
What's gotten into you?
I think a better question would be, what's gotten into you?
I mean, who have you gotten into?
Alan, Alan, listen to me very carefully.
I have not had sex with your girlfriend.
- Still in the planning stages.
- No.
- But you want her.
- No.
- Why not?
What's wrong with her?
- Nothing.
She's terrific.
So you do want her.
When it comes to Lyndsey... you have absolutely nothing to worry about.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
That's what you said about Wendy Freidman... and Kathy Bell and Amy Driskell.
- Who?
- They're all girls you stole from me.
What?
I never stole anybody from you.
Ha, ha.
Wendy Freidman, sixth grade, Halloween party.
I went to get her punch, when I came back, you were bobbing for her apples.
- Innocent fun.
- Ha!
Kathy Bell, ninth grade.
I brought her home.
I went to the bathroom.
When I come back, you were teaching her French.
Harmless horseplay.
Amy Driskell, sophomore year.
First girl who let me get to second base.
All right, her I nailed.
Wait, wait.
Wait.
You nailed her?
Everybody nailed her.
That was her thing.
It took me six months just to touch her right boob.
- You missed the signals, didn't you?
- What signals?
In my case, taking off her sweater and saying:
"Quick, do me before Alan gets back from his trumpet lesson."
Clarinet.
I didn't have the lip for trumpet.
Apparently, you didn't have the lip for Amy either.
But all that was a long time ago.
You're with Lyndsey now.
What's important is that I wish you both a long and happy life together.
- Really?
- From the bottom of my heart.
- Okay.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Though, I'd still like you to move out.
Got it.
- Soon.
- Right.
No, I guess that's about it.
Amy Driskell.
"No, Alan, I'm saving myself for Jesus."
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Come on in.
Hey.
- Wow!
The place looks great.
- Doesn't it?
Even better than before I accidentally almost burned it to the ground.
Yeah.
You're welcome.
Come here.
I wanna give you something.
Oh, heh.
Fooling around?
On the new couch?
Get your mind out of the gutter.
I haven't Scotchgarded yet.
Here.
- A house key?
- Uh-huh.
For this house?
Maybe we're not ready to move in together...
I want you to feel like you can come and go without checking in with me.
Wow.
Thank you.
In a lot of ways, this isn't just the key to your house... it's the key to your heart.
Don't gay it up.
Listen, I'm thinking of having a housewarming party next Saturday.
- Great.
What can I do?
- You can help me with the guest list.
What would you say about inviting Judith and Herb?
- My ex?
- They live across the street...
Herb is always so sweet to me.
Every time Herb looks at you he's pretending you're wet and naked.
All right, fine, I won't invite them.
Probably just upset Judith anyway.
Yeah, you're right.
You know what?
Let's invite them.
- Take the high road.
- All right.
- What about Berta?
- Oh, no, I don't think so.
- Why not?
- She's kind of mean to me.
Honey, that's just because she doesn't like you.
Fine.
Berta.
- And Jake.
- Oh, of course.
Great.
- And Charlie.
- There it is.
- There what is?
- Charlie.
Why do you want Charlie to come to your party?
Why?
When this place burned, he took us in.
He took me in seven years ago, I don't feel the need to invite him.
Oh, come on, he's a great guy.
I really like him.
- Of course.
All the women like Charlie.
- All the women?
Wendy Freidman, Kathy Bell, Amy Driskell.
- Who?
- And now Lyndsey MacElroy.
Oh, please.
Charlie and I are just friends.
No, no.
My brother does not befriend women, he befouls them.
Are you saying you don't trust me?
No.
I don't trust Charlie.
For him, you're unexplored territory.
At some point, he's gonna try and plant his flag in you.
And when I say "flag," I mean his:
Flag.
Okay.
You're out of your mind.
I do not want you hanging out with my brother.
You can be courteous to him.
Like, "Hey.
You've got some vomit on your shoe."
Or "Hey, Charlie, do you need me to move my car... so your hooker can park her pink Camaro?"
Do you realize how insulting this is?
You don't get to tell me who I can be friends with.
It's just Charlie.
I gave you Herb and Berta.
- You know what, I made a mistake.
- Well, I forgive you.
- Give me my key back.
- What?
- Give it to me.
- How can I come and go?
You could forget coming.
You're just gonna be going.
We were doing so good.
We were.
Then you started talking and spoiled it.
Wait.
Okay, okay.
Just to clarify.
You're not as angry with me now as you were when I burned down your house.
Okay, we'll talk after you've gained some perspective.
Jake, Berta, let's go.
Party train's leaving.
That what you're wearing?
- I'm not going.
- Well, why not?
- She and I had a little argument.
- That's too bad.
Jake, Berta, let's go.
Charlie, if you do what I think you're gonna do...
I swear to God, I will never speak to you again.
Really?
Then by all means, tell me exactly what you think I'm gonna do.
You know what I'm talking about.
All right, I'm gonna run this down for you one last time.
I have no interest in Lyndsey... and she has even less interest in me.
- I don't believe you.
You're right.
I'm going to your girlfriend's house.
- I'm gonna do her on the couch.
- No, you won't.
- Why not?
- Couch isn't Scotchgarded yet.
You remember to get the housewarming gift?
Jake's got it.
Jake.
- Very funny.
- We thought so.
Ha.
- How come you're not dressed?
- He and Lyndsey had a fight.
Oh.
That sucks.
See you.
- So you're just gonna sit here all night?
- Oh, I'll be fine.
Oh, I'm sure you will, but if you get bored... there's a load of laundry in the dryer you could fluff and fold.
- So you want me to do your job?
- Somebody has to.
Well, I guess there's nothing left to say except... you're an idiot.
I may be an idiot, but at least I'm home by myself reading Moby Dick.
Upside-down.
[DRYER BUZZES]
Might as well.
Maybe she'll like me better.
Where's Eldridge?

"No matter.
We'll Scotchgard it with our love."
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Hello, Mr. Skunk.
Don't be alarmed.
I was just leaving.
There's certainly no reason to feel threatened.
Good skunk.
Nice skunk.
[GAGGING]
Bad skunk.
Ahh!
Oh, God, Oh, God.
[GAGGING]
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

I'm sorry, but we're full up.
Are you okay?
I'm just a little dizzy.
- You're bleeding.
You need a doctor?
- No, I'm just beat.
- Mom, the room in the attic is vacant.
- 0kay, butjust for one night.
Please write your name here.

Later, Mom.
I'll show you up.
This way.
It's not far.
- Are you sure you're okay?

0kay, I'll whip something up.
Yes?
Here you go.
- Thank you.

Aliena Amiel. 0kay.
If you need anything tonight, you know where to find me.
Mademoiselle, I need a deposit.
- How much?
- 60 euros for last night.
- Can I stay a few more days?
- 0f course.
Where are you from?
Your accent is strange.
It is?
Thanks.
- Hello.
What would you like?
- Coffee with milk, please.
It's now confirmed that the politician Ugo Marshall has been killed.
This footage is from his house in France where the politician was found dead this morning.
Marshall was known for his controversial proposal to cancel third-world debt to the industrialized countries.
The body of another man was also found in the house.
2 km away the police found the body of a local workman.
We will return with any further developments.
Is that nearby?
Marshall's house is 15 minutes away.
He took all his boyfriends there.
Everyone knew that, huh, Jean-Louis?
Thank you.
UG0 MARSHALL SH0T
THE NETHERLANDS:
ANGER AND GRIEF
Good evening.
How may I help you?
Sorry.
Leaving already?
- Do you know those men out there?
- No.
They came in earlier looking for a man with a duffel bag.
Dressed like you.
Do you need a lift somewhere?
Is there another hotel around here?
Sorry, it's just a small village.
You don't have anywhere to go, do you?
You use a false name, you're being pursued by strange men.
Not your ordinary tourist.
I don't know my real name.
I don't remember anything.
I don't know who I am.
0r where I'm from, or what I'm doing here.
I woke up by a river three days ago.
- The Rotja?
- Yes.
Shit!
The murder of Ugo Marshall.
- The guy found by the river ...
- I know.
- Have you been to the police?
- No.
I don't know how I'm involved.
A good friend of mine is a cop.
Want me to talk to him?
Discreetly.
I can't imagine you're involved.
- Your mom says my accent is strange.
- It's strange alright.
- I don't think you're French.
- I speak and think in French.
Yes, but you're not French.
That's for sure.
Here's my card.
Call me, if you need me.
See you.
T0URIST 0FFICE
T0URIST 0FFICE
Calm down.
I'll call you back.
Look.
I can read this.
It's my language.
I'm Danish.
- Remember anything else?
- No, but I'm Danish.
- Can't you read that too?
- Not as well.
But the Danish is no problem at all.
What did your friend have to say?
Not a lot.
My mom called.
Someone broke into the hotel and stole the surveillance DVDs.
What does that mean?
That someone else wants to know who you are.
- Who's that?
- Don't you recognize her?
Shit!
What's she doing here?
Think he's involved too, then?
Thanks.
- I like it.
- Yeah.
Thanks for all your help.
Smiling becomes you.
I'd better think of a Danish name.
Sure you don't want me to go with you to Denmark?
It's nice of you, but I need to do it alone.
Excuse me.
What the hell are you doing?
Sorry.
I just wanted to know what you're listening to.
It's Just 0re.
- Just 0re?
- Yeah.
- Where's he from?
- He's Danish.
- You don't know him?
- No.
I'll write it down for you.

- How do you wish to pay, Mrs. Bjerg?
- In euros.
Cash.
Will you check this artist's concert schedule for me, please?
Just 0re?
Sure.
- Welcome.
- Thanks.
Ida?
Ida!
No, sorry.
I took you for someone else.
Wait!
- Good evening, Mrs. 0re.
- Mrs. 0re?
I'm not quite in the habit of calling you "Ida" yet.
Sorry I didn't recognize you.
It's a big night for you and Just.
I thought you couldn't make it tonight.
It's great to see you.
Let me take your coat.
- I forgot my ticket.
- But you have your regular seat.
Are you okay, Ida?
- Mr. Hansen ...
- 0ve.
- Will you do me a favor?
- Sure.
My shoes are killing me.
Would you lend me an arm to my seat?
With pleasure.
Ida?
It's so good to see you.
You look absolutely fabulous.
When did you return from France?
- Two days ago.
- Thank God.
Anton says Just is beside himself without you.
You really do look wonderful.
And I'm sorry about your godmother.
I want to hear all about it.
We're upstairs.
See you afterwards.
- We need to talk.
- Wait until we're home.
Just.
Thank you for a great show.
Dolly's right.
You do look great.
She can't just have been housecleaning.
Good to see you.
I can't tempt you with a glass of champagne, but Dolly's always game.
- I would like a glass.
- Why, of course.
Cheers.
Fantastic show.
Thanks.
You look beautiful with that hair.

What are you doing?
You know a draught is bad for me.
Sorry.
Let's just go to sleep and make a fresh start tomorrow, huh?
I love you.
- Hello.
- It's Mariette.
We need to talk.
Martin's missing.
- Martin?
- Yes, Martin.
He's wanted by the police in the Netherlands.
They just called, but they wouldn't tell me what was going on.
DEAR SISTER GREAT H0LIDAY, L0VE MARIETTE
Come over, please.
Ida.
Are you there?
- Yes.
I'll be right over.
- Okay, see you then.
DANISH P0LITICIANS SH0CKED BY UG0 MARSHALL'S DEATH
DUTCH P0LICE WITH0UT A CLUE AFTER HUGE R0BBERY
- Drop me off downtown instead.
- Yes.
Sure.
HP Consult.
My name's Ida Ore.
I need the help of a personal investigator.
- A private detective, you mean?
- Yes.
Got an office in town?
No.
No way am I going to take it.
It's your goddamn dog.
I can't talk now.
Bye.
- Is this a bad time?
- No, it's okay.
She's just ...
What can I do for you, Mrs. 0re?
Is the old crooner fooling around?
I deal mostly with infidelity cases, so ...
- I'm being pursued.
- 0kay.
- Maybe it's a fan of your husband.
- No, it's only me.
Please find out who they are as quickly as possible.
I'm staying at this hotel under the name of Anna Bjerg.
Leave a message, if I'm not in.
Can you start right away?
Are you my sister?
Well, I hope so.
Jesus!
I was hoping you could fill in some of the blanks.
We were close as kids, but we don't see each other anymore.
You and Martin kept in touch.
- How does Just feel about all this?
- He doesn't know.
I'm going to talk to him today.
There's something you should know about Just and Martin.
They had some pretty extreme friends.
Look.
I took those pictures.
- What is it?
- Idealistic madmen.
Martin introduced me to Just.
He was a charmer so I agreed to follow them for a couple of months.
I wrote positive articles about their protest rallies and the training camps where they played war.
Then they asked me to watch them extract information from this guy.
And then what?
Just got other interests.
Music and money.
But I haven't spoken to him since.
- What about Martin?
- He's still involved in that crap.
Is there anyone else I can ask?
Any family?
No, there are just the three of us.
I got your message about Martin.
I was very sorry to hear it.
Do you know what happened?
I'd better cancel my meeting in Hamburg tomorrow, don't you think?
Just.
When we met yesterday, I didn't know who you were.
I woke up in France, and the only thing I remembered was your voice.
That's how I found you.
- You woke up in France?
- Yes.
- What were you doing in France?
- I don't know.
- You said I sold Godmother's house.
- I made that up.
I wasn't ready to let the whole world know you might have left me.
Why should I leave you?
Two weeks ago you told me we were going to have a baby.
We were overjoyed, but you lost the baby.
The hospital called and said you'd been in an accident.
- What kind of accident?
- They didn't know.
I rushed over, but when I got there, you were gone.
I almost couldn't stand you being away.
I missed you, Ida.
Mariette told me you and Martin used to be in this group.
Yes.
We were members of this rebel group.
She says you tortured people.
She's been going on about that for 15 years.
She has no idea what we were up to.
I bet your sister went out of her way to depict me as a singing psycho.
But to tell you the truth I think she's jealous.
Because I fell in love with you.
And not her.
Ida, I love you.
We've been together for 14 wonderful years.
I truly believe we can make it work again.
Hello.
Tell them to wait.
0f course.
I'll take the next flight.
Bye.
That was my agent.
He's at Hamburg Airport waiting for me.
- You're leaving now?
- Come with me.
- No.
- Go on.
- I can't.
- 0kay.
See you the day after tomorrow then.
JUST'S 50TH
Long live Just!
Cheers.
- Lovely weather.
- Sure.
I've been a good boy.
Don't I pay you to watch me?
I took the liberty of going home, because my job is done.
I left several messages for you at the hotel.
Here you go.
What happened to you?
- Who are they?
- Dutchmen.
The bald guy is Guus Jansen, 36, a known offender.
Convicted of assault and robbery.
The other guy is Rob Schmidt, 49 and I've traced him back to your brother, Martin Aumont.
They both belonged to the CLWG.
The Communist Liberation Work Group.
In 92 they were arrested in connection with a bomb scare in Rotterdam.
The evidence didn't hold up, so they were released.
Apparently the group has dissolved but it seems like the members have just regrouped.
- So it all comes back to my brother?
- Possibly.
This guy and another guy broke into our house last night.
Just is coming home tomorrow.
Please stake out the house until then.
Sure.
But I think you should go to the police.
I want to talk it over with Just, before I go to the police.
0kay.
If you say so.
And I don't want Just to see you.
But let me know the minute he returns.
It's Mariette.
- Hi.
Thanks for coming.
- Sure.
- I just grabbed something for you.
- Let me just ...
- You sounded upset on the phone.
- I'll explain later.
- Did you talk to Just?
- Yes.
He told me the two of you had been an item.
He said that?
- Well, it's true.
- Why didn't you tell me?
Because it's not the issue here.
Everything I told you about Just is true.
He's not right in the head.
Hello.
Now?
He wasn't due back till tomorrow.
0kay.
Thanks, HP.
I'm on my way.
Just is back.
I have to get home and explain everything.
Ida.
Take care, okay?
I promise.
Ida.
- Good evening.
- See anyone else?
0nly your husband.
Anything else I can do for you?
- No.
- Take care.
HP.
Just?
I found an old list of CLWG members that just might interest you.
Just?
Where have you been?
I called you several times.
You don't answer your phone.
- Are you okay?
- Where have you been?
- I was with Mariette.
- No.
I went to her place, but there was no one there.
We went out.
What are you doing?
- Why are you lying to me?
- What do you mean?
Pierre.
Pierre Blanchare.
Who is he?
You're at it again, aren't you?
At what?
Why did you tell me you don't remember anything?
Huh?
- Why do you make a fool of me?
- I don't ...
Is it Pierre?
Is it Pierre, huh?
Are you fucking Pierre?
All I ever did was love you, and how do you repay me?
By leaving me!
You're destroying me.
Destroying me!
Don't you ever run away from me again.
Understand?
You lost a lot of blood, so we gave you a transfusion and we gave you seven stitches as well.
It was an accident.
I'm afraid you lost the baby.
The police are ready to talk to you when you feel up to it.
And your husband is on his way.
Are you in pain?
Here.
Take one of these.
You can only have half because it's heavy stuff.
There you go.
If you need a place to stay, I know this crisis center called the Nest.
I have to get to Rotterdam to see my brother.
Think that's a good idea?
Well, you need some clothes.
I have this.
It's probably too big, but it's all Rosie has to offer.
Rosie.
That's my name.
Rosie.
What's your name?
Ida.
Ida.
Your ticket's in the front pocket.
If you change your mind, you can find me at the Nest.
Thanks a lot.
Us girls have to stick together, don't we?
Martin?
- Martin!
- Ida, get in!
I've got to go now.
Me too.
The police have nothing to go on in the case of the HD Bank robbery.
They have no leads to the five robbers who got away with 6m euros.
If you saw anything strange in and around Amsterdam on August 11th ...
Good morning.
- What the hell's going on, Martin?
- Who cut you up?
- Who were those people?
- Let me worry about that.
What happened this time?
I was going to leave him.
Again?
You're on the run, aren't you?
- Take me with you.
- No way.
No.
- I'm not going back.
- You always go back.
Prick!
- What did he say?
- They want their money.
- So what are we going to do?
- Find Martin, for fuck's sake!
She's my sister, damn it.
You're in my thoughts too.
Bye.
- He's in love with you.
- I've known him for ages.
I doubt it.
Bobo?
I want you to make a drawing of me for my boyfriend.
- You know I gave up drawing.
- You'll just have to take it up again.
- I can't come without a gift.
- Who is your boyfriend?
A bad boy.
Lift your head.
- Are you still in that activist group?
- No.
How about the robbery?
- Those men didn't look like cops.
- It's best to keep you in the dark.
I'm trying to start over, make a new life for myself.
Can you?
Can you?
Draw.
Hi, Guus.
It's Ron.
Wake up.
Grab your stuff.
We're leaving.
- What's up?
- We can't stay here.
- Is Tim back?
- No, and we can't wait any longer.
Move over!
Get him out!
Get him out!
What the hell are you doing?
What are you doing?
You hit him!
Stop the car!
Martin!
- Stop!
- Get down!
Down!
Down!
- Is this how you live your life?
- Yeah.
More or less.
Why?
You want to go home?
You didn't answer my question.
At some point I realized I was guided by the wrong principles.
How so?
The money from the robbery was meant for arms for the Middle East.
- I took off with the money.
- Have you gone insane?
Ever heard of Ugo Marshall?
Sure.
The politician behind the aid programs.
Ugo Marshall is your boyfriend?
My drawing is for him?
He's the best thing that ever happened to me.
I know he'll use the money to give lots of people a better life.
- Still no answer.
- Doesn't he have a cell phone?
Sure, but he doesn't use it outside work.
- So now what?
- We keep going.
- Well?
- He's stubborn.
If he knew they were at the hotel, he knows where they went, too.
Make him talk.
0h, for fuck's sake!
Not now!
Come on, come on.
Fuck!
Are we in France?
- Fucking car!
- Relax.
So go past me!
Can't you fix it?
If only you hadn't shown up, we wouldn't be in this fucking car.
Hey, baby.
Damn, am I glad to hear your voice.
Is everything okay?
No, we're not far away.
But you're not safe there.
Pack your stuff and be ready.
- There.
- Thanks.
What's going on in there?
I was pregnant.
Christ, Bobo.
He refused to believe it was his.
Why do you let him do this?
I love him.
2,50 euros.
Anything else?
- Have you got a phone?
- Downstairs next to the bathrooms.
This is Just Ore.
Please leave a message.
Who are you calling?
Nobody.
You called home.
Did you call home?
- You're so fucking stupid!
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I never should've come.
- I can't go with you.
- You're going to stay here or what?
You're going back?
I don't fucking believe it.
- I don't have time for this.
Let's go.
- No, no, no!
Don't you get it?
Don't you get who's after me?
I was supposed to give Just the money.
He was too violent for the CLWG.
Now he's fallen in with a tougher crowd and they will kill you, if they find out you're in the know.
What will it take to make you leave that psycho?
Good luck, Bobo.
Martin!
- Anything wrong?
- No.
I just want to make sure.
Everything looks fine.
Wait here.
No!
No!
Martin?
Martin, they're still here.
Martin, let's get out of here.
We need to get out of here.
He's dead.
Let's go.
We need to get out of here, Martin.
Run for the woods.
Head down.
Now!
Martin?
Ida.
Martin?
Come here.
What's going on, Martin?
Take the money and get out of here.
- What about you?
- Promise you won't go back to him.
Just promise me you won't go back.
Go, Bobo.
Good luck.
Guus!
Help!
Save me from those men ...
- What are you doing here, Monsieur?
- Save me from those men!
It's dangerous here.
Go back.
Monsieur ...
Help me.
Help!
Some men are ...
Ida?
Are you okay?
The police confirm that Just Ore was killed in a home robbery last week.
The robbers presumably thought he had large sums of money at home.
Thus the police rule out other theories of a contract killing.
In the Netherlands the police have recovered most of the money ...
Roni Hansen?
I have a package for you from the Nest.
US GIRLS HAVE T0 STICK T0GETHER
I'll be right with you.
Is the room in the attic vacant?
I'm sorry, but we're full up.
Are you okay?
I'm just a little dizzy.
- You're bleeding.
You need a doctor?
- No, I'm just beat.
- Mom, the room in the attic is vacant.
- Okay, but just for one night.
Please write your name here.
NAME
Later, Mom.
I'll show you up.
This way.
It's not far.
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yes.
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.
Okay, I'll whip something up.
Yes?
Here you go.
- Thank you.
- I'm Pierre.
Pierre Blanchare.
Aliena.
Amiel.
Aliena Amiel.
Okay.
If you need anything tonight, you know where to find me.
Mademoiselle, I need a deposit.
- How much?
- 60 Euros for last night.
- Can I stay a few more days?
- Of course.
Where are you from?
Your accent is strange.
It is?
Thanks.
- Hello.
What would you like?
- Coffee with milk, please.
It's now confirmed that the politician Ugo Marshall has been killed.
This footage is from his house in France where the politician was found dead this morning.
Marshall was known for his controversial proposal to cancel third-world debt to the industrialized countries.
The body of another man was also found in the house.
2 km away the police found the body of a local workman.
We will return with any further developments.
Is that nearby?
Marshall's house is 15 minutes away.
He took all his boyfriends there.
Everyone knew that, huh, Jean-Louis?
Thank you.
UGO MARSHALL SHOT
THE NETHERLANDS:
ANGER AND GRIEF
Good evening.
How may I help you?
Sorry.
Leaving already?
- Do you know those men out there?
- No.
They came in earlier looking for a man with a duffel bag.
Dressed like you.
Do you need a lift somewhere?
Is there another hotel around here?
Sorry, it's just a small village.
You don't have anywhere to go, do you?
You use a false name, you're being pursued by strange men.
Not your ordinary tourist.
I don't know my real name.
I don't remember anything.
I don't know who I am.
0r where I'm from, or what I'm doing here.
I woke up by a river three days ago.
- The Rotja?
- Yes.
Shit!
The murder of Ugo Marshall.
- The guy found by the river ...
- I know.
- Have you been to the police?
- No.
I don't know how I'm involved.
A good friend of mine is a cop.
Want me to talk to him?
Discreetly.
I can't imagine you're involved.
- Your mom says my accent is strange.
- It's strange alright.
- I don't think you're French.
- I speak and think in French.
Yes, but you're not French.
That's for sure.
Here's my card.
Call me, if you need me.
See you.

I can read this.
It's my language.
I'm Danish.
- Remember anything else?
- No, but I'm Danish.
- Can't you read that too?
- Not as well.
But the Danish is no problem at all.
What did your friend have to say?
Not a lot.
My mom called.
Someone broke into the hotel and stole the surveillance DVDs.
What does that mean?
That someone else wants to know who you are.

Thanks for all your help.
Smiling becomes you.
I'd better think of a Danish name.
Sure you don't want me to go with you to Denmark?
It's nice of you, but I need to do it alone.
Excuse me.

I just wanted to know what you're listening to.
It's Just 0re.

This guy and another guy broke into our house last night.
Just is coming home tomorrow.
Please stake out the house until then.
Sure.
But I think you should go to the police.
I want to talk it over with Just, before I go to the police.
0kay.
If you say so.
And I don't want Just to see you.
But let me know the minute he returns.
It's Mariette.
- Hi.
Thanks for coming.
- Sure.
- I just grabbed something for you.
- Let me just ...
- You sounded upset on the phone.
- I'll explain later.
- Did you talk to Just?
- Yes.
He told me the two of you had been an item.
He said that?
- Well, it's true.
- Why didn't you tell me?
Because it's not the issue here.
Everything I told you about Just is true.
He's not right in the head.
Hello.
Now?
He wasn't due back till tomorrow.
0kay.
Thanks, HP.
I'm on my way.
Just is back.
I have to get home and explain everything.
Ida.
Take care, okay?
I promise.
Ida.
- Good evening.
- See anyone else?
0nly your husband.
Anything else I can do for you?
- No.
- Take care.
HP.
Just?
I found an old list of CLWG members that just might interest you.
Just?
Where have you been?
I called you several times.
You don't answer your phone.
- Are you okay?
- Where have you been?
- I was with Mariette.
- No.
I went to her place, but there was no one there.
We went out.
What are you doing?
- Why are you lying to me?
- What do you mean?
Pierre.
Pierre Blanchare.
Who is he?
You're at it again, aren't you?
At what?
Why did you tell me you don't remember anything?
Huh?
- Why do you make a fool of me?
- I don't ...
Is it Pierre?
Is it Pierre, huh?
Are you fucking Pierre?
All I ever did was love you, and how do you repay me?
By leaving me!
You're destroying me.
Destroying me!
Don't you ever run away from me again.
Understand?
You lost a lot of blood, so we gave you a transfusion and we gave you seven stitches as well.
It was an accident.
I'm afraid you lost the baby.
The police are ready to talk to you when you feel up to it.
And your husband is on his way.
Are you in pain?
Here.
Take one of these.
You can only have half because it's heavy stuff.
There you go.
If you need a place to stay, I know this crisis centre called the Nest.
I have to get to Rotterdam to see my brother.
Think that's a good idea?
Well, you need some clothes.
I have this.
It's probably too big, but it's all Rosie has to offer.
Rosie.
That's my name.
Rosie.
What's your name?
Ida.
Ida.
Your ticket's in the front pocket.
If you change your mind, you can find me at the Nest.
Thanks a lot.
Us girls have to stick together, don't we?
Martin?
- Martin!
- Ida, get in!
I've got to go now.
Me too.
The police have nothing to go on in the case of the HD Bank robbery.
They have no leads to the five robbers who got away with 6m Euros.
If you saw anything strange in and around Amsterdam on August 11th ...
Good morning.
- What the hell's going on, Martin?
- Who cut you up?
- Who were those people?
- Let me worry about that.
What happened this time?
I was going to leave him.
Again?
You're on the run, aren't you?
- Take me with you.
- No way.
No.
- I'm not going back.
- You always go back.
Prick!
- What did he say?
- They want their money.
- So what are we going to do?
- Find Martin, for fuck's sake!
She's my sister, damn it.
You're in my thoughts too.
Bye.
- He's in love with you.
- I've known him for ages.
I doubt it.
Bobo?
I want you to make a drawing of me for my boyfriend.
- You know I gave up drawing.
- You'll just have to take it up again.
- I can't come without a gift.
- Who is your boyfriend?
A bad boy.
Lift your head.
- Are you still in that activist group?
- No.
How about the robbery?
- Those men didn't look like cops.
- It's best to keep you in the dark.
I'm trying to start over, make a new life for myself.
Can you?
Can you?
Draw.
Hi, Guus.
It's Ron.
Wake up.
Grab your stuff.
We're leaving.
- What's up?
- We can't stay here.
- Is Tim back?
- No, and we can't wait any longer.
Move over!
Get him out!
Get him out!
What the hell are you doing?
What are you doing?
You hit him!
Stop the car!
Martin!
- Stop!
- Get down!
Down!
Down!
- Is this how you live your life?
- Yeah.
More or less.
Why?
You want to go home?
You didn't answer my question.
At some point I realized I was guided by the wrong principles.
How so?
The money from the robbery was meant for arms for the Middle East.
- I took off with the money.
- Have you gone insane?
Ever heard of Ugo Marshall?
Sure.
The politician behind the aid programs.
Ugo Marshall is your boyfriend?
My drawing is for him?
He's the best thing that ever happened to me.
I know he'll use the money to give lots of people a better life.
- Still no answer.
- Doesn't he have a cell phone?
Sure, but he doesn't use it outside work.
- So now what?
- We keep going.
- Well?
- He's stubborn.
If he knew they were at the hotel, he knows where they went, too.
Make him talk.
0h, for fuck's sake!
Not now!
Come on, come on.
Fuck!
Are we in France?
- Fucking car!
- Relax.
So go past me!
Can't you fix it?
If only you hadn't shown up, we wouldn't be in this fucking car.
Hey, baby.
Damn, am I glad to hear your voice.
Is everything okay?
No, we're not far away.
But you're not safe there.
Pack your stuff and be ready.
- There.
- Thanks.
What's going on in there?
I was pregnant.
Christ, Bobo.
He refused to believe it was his.
Why do you let him do this?
I love him.
2,50 Euros.
Anything else?
- Have you got a phone?
- Downstairs next to the bathrooms.
This is Just Ore.
Please leave a message.
Who are you calling?
Nobody.
You called home.
Did you call home?
- You're so fucking stupid!
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I never should've come.
- I can't go with you.
- You're going to stay here or what?
You're going back?
I don't fucking believe it.
- I don't have time for this.
Let's go.
- No, no, no!
Don't you get it?
Don't you get who's after me?
I was supposed to give Just the money.
He was too violent for the CLWG.
Now he's fallen in with a tougher crowd and they will kill you, if they find out you're in the know.
What will it take to make you leave that psycho?
Good luck, Bobo.
Martin!
- Anything wrong?
- No.
I just want to make sure.
Everything looks fine.
Wait here.
No!
No!
Martin?
Martin, they're still here.
Martin, let's get out of here.
We need to get out of here.
He's dead.
Let's go.
We need to get out of here, Martin.
Run for the woods.
Head down.
Now!
Martin?
Ida.
Martin?
Come here.
What's going on, Martin?
Take the money and get out of here.
- What about you?
- Promise you won't go back to him.
Just promise me you won't go back.
Go, Bobo.
Good luck.
Guus!
Help!
Save me from those men ...
- What are you doing here, Monsieur?
- Save me from those men!
It's dangerous here.
Go back.
Monsieur ...
Help me.
Help!
Some men are ...
Ida?
Are you okay?
The police confirm that Just Ore was killed in a home robbery last week.
The robbers presumably thought he had large sums of money at home.
Thus the police rule out other theories of a contract killing.
In the Netherlands the police have recovered most of the money ...
Roni Hansen?
I have a package for you from the Nest.
US GIRLS HAVE T0 STICK T0GETHER
I'll be right with you.
Is the room in the attic vacant?
I'm sorry, but we're full up.
Are you okay?
I'm just a little dizzy.
- You're bleeding.
You need a doctor?
- No, I'm just beat.
- Mom, the room in the attic is vacant.
- 0kay, butjust for one night.
Please write your name here.
NAME
Later, Mom.
I'll show you up.
This way.
It's not far.
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yes.
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.
0kay, I'll whip something up.
Yes?
Here you go.
- Thank you.
- I'm Pierre.
Pierre Blanchare.
Aliena.
Amiel.
Aliena Amiel. 0kay.
If you need anything tonight, you know where to find me.
Mademoiselle, I need a deposit.
- How much?
- 60 euros for last night.
- Can I stay a few more days?
- 0f course.
Where are you from?
Your accent is strange.
It is?
Thanks.
- Hello.
What would you like?
- Coffee with milk, please.
It's now confirmed that the politician Ugo Marshall has been killed.
This footage is from his house in France where the politician was found dead this morning.
Marshall was known for his controversial proposal to cancel third-world debt to the industrialized countries.
The body of another man was also found in the house.
2 km away the police found the body of a local workman.
We will return with any further developments.
Is that nearby?
Marshall's house is 15 minutes away.
He took all his boyfriends there.
Everyone knew that, huh, Jean-Louis?
Thank you.
UG0 MARSHALL SH0T
THE NETHERLANDS:
ANGER AND GRIEF
Good evening.
How may I help you?
Sorry.
Leaving already?
- Do you know those men out there?
- No.
They came in earlier looking for a man with a duffel bag.
Dressed like you.
Do you need a lift somewhere?
Is there another hotel around here?
Sorry, it's just a small village.
You don't have anywhere to go, do you?
You use a false name, you're being pursued by strange men.
Not your ordinary tourist.
I don't know my real name.
I don't remember anything.
I don't know who I am.
0r where I'm from, or what I'm doing here.
I woke up by a river three days ago.
- The Rotja?
- Yes.
Shit!
The murder of Ugo Marshall.
- The guy found by the river ...
- I know.
- Have you been to the police?
- No.
I don't know how I'm involved.
A good friend of mine is a cop.
Want me to talk to him?
Discreetly.
I can't imagine you're involved.
- Your mom says my accent is strange.
- It's strange alright.
- I don't think you're French.
- I speak and think in French.
Yes, but you're not French.
That's for sure.
Here's my card.
Call me, if you need me.
See you.
T0URIST 0FFICE
T0URIST 0FFICE
Calm down.
I'll call you back.
Look.
I can read this.
It's my language.
I'm Danish.
- Remember anything else?
- No, but I'm Danish.
- Can't you read that too?
- Not as well.
But the Danish is no problem at all.
What did your friend have to say?
Not a lot.
My mom called.
Someone broke into the hotel and stole the surveillance DVDs.
What does that mean?
That someone else wants to know who you are.
- Who's that?
- Don't you recognize her?
Shit!
What's she doing here?
Think he's involved too, then?
Thanks.
- I like it.
- Yeah.
Thanks for all your help.
Smiling becomes you.
I'd better think of a Danish name.
Sure you don't want me to go with you to Denmark?
It's nice of you, but I need to do it alone.
Excuse me.
What the hell are you doing?
Sorry.
I just wanted to know what you're listening to.
It's Just 0re.
- Just 0re?
- Yeah.
- Where's he from?
- He's Danish.
- You don't know him?
- No.
I'll write it down for you.
C0PENHAGEN
- How do you wish to pay, Mrs. Bjerg?
- In euros.
Cash.
Will you check this artist's concert schedule for me, please?
Just 0re?
Sure.
- Welcome.
- Thanks.
Ida?
Ida!
No, sorry.
I took you for someone else.
Wait!
- Good evening, Mrs. 0re.
- Mrs. 0re?
I'm not quite in the habit of calling you "Ida" yet.
Sorry I didn't recognize you.
It's a big night for you and Just.
I thought you couldn't make it tonight.
It's great to see you.
Let me take your coat.
- I forgot my ticket.
- But you have your regular seat.
Are you okay, Ida?
- Mr. Hansen ...
- 0ve.
- Will you do me a favor?
- Sure.
My shoes are killing me.
Would you lend me an arm to my seat?
With pleasure.
Ida?
It's so good to see you.
You look absolutely fabulous.
When did you return from France?
- Two days ago.
- Thank God.
Anton says Just is beside himself without you.
You really do look wonderful.
And I'm sorry about your godmother.
I want to hear all about it.
We're upstairs.
See you afterwards.
- We need to talk.
- Wait until we're home.
Just.
Thank you for a great show.
Dolly's right.
You do look great.
She can't just have been housecleaning.
Good to see you.
I can't tempt you with a glass of champagne, but Dolly's always game.
- I would like a glass.
- Why, of course.
Cheers.
Fantastic show.
Thanks.
You look beautiful with that hair.
IDA AUM0NT 0RE ANTIDEPRESSANT
ANTIDEPRESSANT
What are you doing?
You know a draught is bad for me.
Sorry.
Let's just go to sleep and make a fresh start tomorrow, huh?
I love you.
- Hello.
- It's Mariette.
We need to talk.
Martin's missing.
- Martin?
- Yes, Martin.
He's wanted by the police in the Netherlands.
They just called, but they wouldn't tell me what was going on.
DEAR SISTER GREAT H0LIDAY, L0VE MARIETTE
Come over, please.
Ida.
Are you there?
- Yes.
I'll be right over.
- Okay, see you then.
DANISH P0LITICIANS SH0CKED BY UG0 MARSHALL'S DEATH
DUTCH P0LICE WITH0UT A CLUE AFTER HUGE R0BBERY
- Drop me off downtown instead.
- Yes.
Sure.
HP Consult.
My name's Ida Ore.
I need the help of a personal investigator.
- A private detective, you mean?
- Yes.
Got an office in town?
No.
No way am I going to take it.
It's your goddamn dog.
I can't talk now.
Bye.
- Is this a bad time?
- No, it's okay.
She's just ...
What can I do for you, Mrs. 0re?
Is the old crooner fooling around?
I deal mostly with infidelity cases, so ...
- I'm being pursued.
- 0kay.
- Maybe it's a fan of your husband.
- No, it's only me.
Please find out who they are as quickly as possible.
I'm staying at this hotel under the name of Anna Bjerg.
Leave a message, if I'm not in.
Can you start right away?
Are you my sister?
Well, I hope so.
Jesus!
I was hoping you could fill in some of the blanks.
We were close as kids, but we don't see each other anymore.
You and Martin kept in touch.
- How does Just feel about all this?
- He doesn't know.
I'm going to talk to him today.
There's something you should know about Just and Martin.
They had some pretty extreme friends.
Look.
I took those pictures.
- What is it?
- Idealistic madmen.
Martin introduced me to Just.
He was a charmer so I agreed to follow them for a couple of months.
I wrote positive articles about their protest rallies and the training camps where they played war.
Then they asked me to watch them extract information from this guy.
And then what?
Just got other interests.
Music and money.
But I haven't spoken to him since.
- What about Martin?
- He's still involved in that crap.
Is there anyone else I can ask?
Any family?
No, there are just the three of us.
I got your message about Martin.
I was very sorry to hear it.
Do you know what happened?
I'd better cancel my meeting in Hamburg tomorrow, don't you think?
Just.
When we met yesterday, I didn't know who you were.
I woke up in France, and the only thing I remembered was your voice.
That's how I found you.
- You woke up in France?
- Yes.
- What were you doing in France?
- I don't know.
- You said I sold Godmother's house.
- I made that up.
I wasn't ready to let the whole world know you might have left me.
Why should I leave you?
Two weeks ago you told me we were going to have a baby.
We were overjoyed, but you lost the baby.
The hospital called and said you'd been in an accident.
- What kind of accident?
- They didn't know.
I rushed over, but when I got there, you were gone.
I almost couldn't stand you being away.
I missed you, Ida.
Mariette told me you and Martin used to be in this group.
Yes.
We were members of this rebel group.
She says you tortured people.
She's been going on about that for 15 years.
She has no idea what we were up to.
I bet your sister went out of her way to depict me as a singing psycho.
But to tell you the truth I think she's jealous.
Because I fell in love with you.
And not her.
Ida, I love you.
We've been together for 14 wonderful years.
I truly believe we can make it work again.
Hello.
Tell them to wait.
0f course.
I'll take the next flight.
Bye.
That was my agent.
He's at Hamburg Airport waiting for me.
- You're leaving now?
- Come with me.
- No.
- Go on.
- I can't.
- 0kay.
See you the day after tomorrow then.
JUST'S 50TH
Long live Just!
Cheers.
- Lovely weather.
- Sure.
I've been a good boy.
Don't I pay you to watch me?
I took the liberty of going home, because my job is done.
I left several messages for you at the hotel.
Here you go.
What happened to you?
- Who are they?
- Dutchmen.
The bald guy is Guus Jansen, 36, a known offender.
Convicted of assault and robbery.
The other guy is Rob Schmidt, 49 and I've traced him back to your brother, Martin Aumont.
They both belonged to the CLWG.
The Communist Liberation Work Group.
In 92 they were arrested in connection with a bomb scare in Rotterdam.
The evidence didn't hold up, so they were released.
Apparently the group has dissolved but it seems like the members have just regrouped.
- So it all comes back to my brother?
- Possibly.
This guy and another guy broke into our house last night.
Just is coming home tomorrow.
Please stake out the house until then.
Sure.
But I think you should go to the police.
I want to talk it over with Just, before I go to the police.
0kay.
If you say so.
And I don't want Just to see you.
But let me know the minute he returns.
It's Mariette.
- Hi.
Thanks for coming.
- Sure.
- I just grabbed something for you.
- Let me just ...
- You sounded upset on the phone.
- I'll explain later.
- Did you talk to Just?
- Yes.
He told me the two of you had been an item.
He said that?
- Well, it's true.
- Why didn't you tell me?
Because it's not the issue here.
Everything I told you about Just is true.
He's not right in the head.
Hello.
Now?
He wasn't due back till tomorrow.
0kay.
Thanks, HP.
I'm on my way.
Just is back.
I have to get home and explain everything.
Ida.
Take care, okay?
I promise.
Ida.
- Good evening.
- See anyone else?
0nly your husband.
Anything else I can do for you?
- No.
- Take care.
HP.
Just?
I found an old list of CLWG members that just might interest you.
Just?
Where have you been?
I called you several times.
You don't answer your phone.
- Are you okay?
- Where have you been?
- I was with Mariette.
- No.
I went to her place, but there was no one there.
We went out.
What are you doing?
- Why are you lying to me?
- What do you mean?
Pierre.
Pierre Blanchare.
Who is he?
You're at it again, aren't you?
At what?
Why did you tell me you don't remember anything?
Huh?
- Why do you make a fool of me?
- I don't ...
Is it Pierre?
Is it Pierre, huh?
Are you fucking Pierre?
All I ever did was love you, and how do you repay me?
By leaving me!
You're destroying me.
Destroying me!
Don't you ever run away from me again.
Understand?
You lost a lot of blood, so we gave you a transfusion and we gave you seven stitches as well.

You can only have half because it's heavy stuff.
There you go.
If you need a place to stay, I know this crisis center called the Nest.
I have to get to Rotterdam to see my brother.
Think that's a good idea?
Well, you need some clothes.
I have this.
It's probably too big, but it's all Rosie has to offer.
Rosie.
That's my name.
Rosie.
What's your name?
Ida.
Ida.
Your ticket's in the front pocket.
If you change your mind, you can find me at the Nest.
Thanks a lot.
Us girls have to stick together, don't we?

I was going to leave him.
Again?
You're on the run, aren't you?
- Take me with you.
- No way.
No.
- I'm not going back.
- You always go back.
Prick!
- What did he say?
- They want their money.
- So what are we going to do?
- Find Martin, for fuck's sake!
She's my sister, damn it.
You're in my thoughts too.
Bye.
- He's in love with you.
- I've known him for ages.
I doubt it.
Bobo?
I want you to make a drawing of me for my boyfriend.
- You know I gave up drawing.
- You'll just have to take it up again.
- I can't come without a gift.
- Who is your boyfriend?
A bad boy.
Lift your head.

How about the robbery?

Hi, Guus.

Wake up.
Grab your stuff.
We're leaving.
- What's up?
- We can't stay here.
- Is Tim back?
- No, and we can't wait any longer.
Move over!
Get him out!
Get him out!
What the hell are you doing?
What are you doing?
You hit him!
Stop the car!
Martin!
- Stop!
- Get down!
Down!
Down!
- Is this how you live your life?
- Yeah.
More or less.
Why?
You want to go home?
You didn't answer my question.
At some point I realized I was guided by the wrong principles.
How so?
The money from the robbery was meant for arms for the Middle East.

- Doesn't he have a cell phone?
Sure, but he doesn't use it outside work.
- So now what?
- We keep going.
- Well?
- He's stubborn.
If he knew they were at the hotel, he knows where they went, too.
Make him talk.
0h, for fuck's sake!
Not now!
Come on, come on.
Fuck!
Are we in France?
- Fucking car!
- Relax.
So go past me!
Can't you fix it?
If only you hadn't shown up, we wouldn't be in this fucking car.
Hey, baby.
Damn, am I glad to hear your voice.
Is everything okay?
No, we're not far away.
But you're not safe there.
Pack your stuff and be ready.
- There.
- Thanks.
What's going on in there?
I was pregnant.
Christ, Bobo.
He refused to believe it was his.
Why do you let him do this?
I love him.
2,50 euros.
Anything else?
- Have you got a phone?
- Downstairs next to the bathrooms.
This is Just Ore.
Please leave a message.
Who are you calling?
Nobody.
You called home.
Did you call home?
- You're so fucking stupid!
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I never should've come.
- I can't go with you.
- You're going to stay here or what?
You're going back?
I don't fucking believe it.
- I don't have time for this.
Let's go.
- No, no, no!
Don't you get it?
Don't you get who's after me?
I was supposed to give Just the money.
He was too violent for the CLWG.
Now he's fallen in with a tougher crowd and they will kill you, if they find out you're in the know.
What will it take to make you leave that psycho?
Good luck, Bobo.
Martin!
- Anything wrong?
- No.
I just want to make sure.
Everything looks fine.
Wait here.
No!
No!
Martin?
Martin, they're still here.
Martin, let's get out of here.
We need to get out of here.
He's dead.
Let's go.
We need to get out of here, Martin.
Run for the woods.
Head down.
Now!
Martin?
Ida.
Martin?
Come here.
What's going on, Martin?
Take the money and get out of here.
- What about you?
- Promise you won't go back to him.
Just promise me you won't go back.
Go, Bobo.
Good luck.
Guus!
Help!
Save me from those men ...
- What are you doing here, Monsieur?
- Save me from those men!
It's dangerous here.
Go back.
Monsieur ...
Help me.
Help!
Some men are ...
Ida?
Are you okay?
The police confirm that Just Ore was killed in a home robbery last week.
The robbers presumably thought he had large sums of money at home.
Thus the police rule out other theories of a contract killing.
In the Netherlands the police have recovered most of the money ...
Roni Hansen?
I have a package for you from the Nest.
US GIRLS HAVE T0 STICK T0GETHER
I'll be right with you.
Is the room in the attic vacant?
I'm sorry, but we're full up.
Are you okay?
I'm just a little dizzy.
- You're bleeding.
You need a doctor?
- No, I'm just beat.
- Mom, the room in the attic is vacant.
- Okay, but just for one night.
Please write your name here.
NAME
Later, Mom.
I'll show you up.
This way.
It's not far.
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yes.
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.
Okay, I'll whip something up.
Yes?
Here you go.
- Thank you.
- I'm Pierre.
Pierre Blanchare.
Aliena.
Amiel.
Aliena Amiel.
Okay.
If you need anything tonight, you know where to find me.
Mademoiselle, I need a deposit.
- How much?
- 60 euros for last night.
- Can I stay a few more days?
- Of course.
Where are you from?
Your accent is strange.
It is?
Thanks.
- Hello.
What would you like?
- Coffee with milk, please.
It's now confirmed that the politician Ugo Marshall has been killed.
This footage is from his house in France where the politician was found dead this morning.
Marshall was known for his controversial proposal to cancel third-world debt to the industrialized countries.
The body of another man was also found in the house.
2 km away the police found the body of a local workman.
We will return with any further developments.
Is that nearby?
Marshall's house is 15 minutes away.
He took all his boyfriends there.
Everyone knew that, huh, Jean-Louis?
Thank you.
UGO MARSHALL SHOT
THE NETHERLANDS:
ANGER AND GRIEF
Good evening.
How may I help you?
Sorry.
Leaving already?
- Do you know those men out there?
- No.
They came in earlier looking for a man with a duffel bag.
Dressed like you.
Do you need a lift somewhere?
Is there another hotel around here?
Sorry, it's just a small village.
You don't have anywhere to go, do you?
You use a false name, you're being pursued by strange men.
Not your ordinary tourist.
I don't know my real name.
I don't remember anything.
I don't know who I am.
Or where I'm from, or what I'm doing here.
I woke up by a river three days ago.
- The Rotja?
- Yes.
Shit!
The murder of Ugo Marshall.
- The guy found by the river ...
- I know.
- Have you been to the police?
- No.
I don't know how I'm involved.
A good friend of mine is a cop.
Want me to talk to him?
Discreetly.
I can't imagine you're involved.
- Your mom says my accent is strange.
- It's strange alright.
- I don't think you're French.
- I speak and think in French.
Yes, but you're not French.
That's for sure.
Here's my card.
Call me, if you need me.
See you.
TOURIST OFFICE
TOURIST OFFICE
Calm down.
I'll call you back.
Look.
I can read this.
It's my language.
I'm Danish.
- Remember anything else?
- No, but I'm Danish.
- Can't you read that too?
- Not as well.
But the Danish is no problem at all.
What did your friend have to say?
Not a lot.
My mom called.
Someone broke into the hotel and stole the surveillance DVDs.
What does that mean?
That someone else wants to know who you are.
- Who's that?
- Don't you recognize her?
Shit!
What's she doing here?
Think he's involved too, then?
Thanks.
- I like it.
- Yeah.
Thanks for all your help.
Smiling becomes you.
I'd better think of a Danish name.
Sure you don't want me to go with you to Denmark?
It's nice of you, but I need to do it alone.
Excuse me.
What the hell are you doing?
Sorry.
I just wanted to know what you're listening to.
It's Just Ore.
- Just Ore?
- Yeah.
- Where's he from?
- He's Danish.
- You don't know him?
- No.
I'll write it down for you.
COPENHAGEN
- How do you wish to pay, Mrs. Bjerg?
- In euros.
Cash.
Will you check this artist's concert schedule for me, please?
Just Ore?
Sure.
- Welcome.
- Thanks.
Ida?
Ida!
No, sorry.
I took you for someone else.
Wait!
- Good evening, Mrs. Ore.
- Mrs. Ore?
I'm not quite in the habit of calling you "Ida" yet.
Sorry I didn't recognize you.
It's a big night for you and Just.
I thought you couldn't make it tonight.
It's great to see you.
Let me take your coat.
- I forgot my ticket.
- But you have your regular seat.
Are you okay, Ida?
- Mr. Hansen ...
- Ove.
- Will you do me a favor?
- Sure.
My shoes are killing me.
Would you lend me an arm to my seat?
With pleasure.
Ida?
It's so good to see you.
You look absolutely fabulous.
When did you return from France?
- Two days ago.
- Thank God.
Anton says Just is beside himself without you.
You really do look wonderful.
And I'm sorry about your godmother.
I want to hear all about it.
We're upstairs.
See you afterwards.
- We need to talk.
- Wait until we're home.
Just.
Thank you for a great show.
Dolly's right.
You do look great.
She can't just have been housecleaning.
Good to see you.
I can't tempt you with a glass of champagne, but Dolly's always game.
- I would like a glass.
- Why, of course.
Cheers.
Fantastic show.
Thanks.
You look beautiful with that hair.
IDA AUMONT ORE ANTIDEPRESSANT
ANTIDEPRESSANT
What are you doing?
You know a draught is bad for me.
Sorry.
Let's just go to sleep and make a fresh start tomorrow, huh?
I love you.
- Hello.
- It's Mariette.
We need to talk.
Martin's missing.
- Martin?
- Yes, Martin.
He's wanted by the police in the Netherlands.
They just called, but they wouldn't tell me what was going on.
DEAR SISTER GREAT HOLIDAY, LOVE MARIETTE
Come over, please.
Ida.
Are you there?
- Yes.
I'll be right over.
- Okay, see you then.
DANISH POLITICIANS SHOCKED BY UGO MARSHALL'S DEATH
DUTCH POLICE WITHOUT A CLUE AFTER HUGE ROBBERY
- Drop me off downtown instead.
- Yes.
Sure.
HP Consult.
My name's Ida Ore.
I need the help of a personal investigator.
- A private detective, you mean?
- Yes.
Got an office in town?
No.
No way am I going to take it.
It's your goddamn dog.
I can't talk now.
Bye.
- Is this a bad time?
- No, it's okay.
She's just ...
What can I do for you, Mrs. Ore?
Is the old crooner fooling around?
I deal mostly with infidelity cases, so ...
- I'm being pursued.
- Okay.
- Maybe it's a fan of your husband.
- No, it's only me.
Please find out who they are as quickly as possible.
I'm staying at this hotel under the name of Anna Bjerg.
Leave a message, if I'm not in.
Can you start right away?
Are you my sister?
Well, I hope so.
Jesus!
I was hoping you could fill in some of the blanks.
We were close as kids, but we don't see each other anymore.
You and Martin kept in touch.
- How does Just feel about all this?
- He doesn't know.
I'm going to talk to him today.
There's something you should know about Just and Martin.
They had some pretty extreme friends.
Look.
I took those pictures.
- What is it?
- Idealistic madmen.
Martin introduced me to Just.
He was a charmer so I agreed to follow them for a couple of months.
I wrote positive articles about their protest rallies and the training camps where they played war.
Then they asked me to watch them extract information from this guy.
And then what?
Just got other interests.
Music and money.
But I haven't spoken to him since.
- What about Martin?
- He's still involved in that crap.
Is there anyone else I can ask?
Any family?
No, there are just the three of us.
I got your message about Martin.
I was very sorry to hear it.
Do you know what happened?
I'd better cancel my meeting in Hamburg tomorrow, don't you think?
Just.
When we met yesterday, I didn't know who you were.
I woke up in France, and the only thing I remembered was your voice.
That's how I found you.
- You woke up in France?
- Yes.
- What were you doing in France?
- I don't know.
- You said I sold Godmother's house.
- I made that up.
I wasn't ready to let the whole world know you might have left me.
Why should I leave you?
Two weeks ago you told me we were going to have a baby.
We were overjoyed, but you lost the baby.
The hospital called and said you'd been in an accident.
- What kind of accident?
- They didn't know.
I rushed over, but when I got there, you were gone.
I almost couldn't stand you being away.
I missed you, Ida.
Mariette told me you and Martin used to be in this group.
Yes.
We were members of this rebel group.
She says you tortured people.
She's been going on about that for 15 years.
She has no idea what we were up to.
I bet your sister went out of her way to depict me as a singing psycho.
But to tell you the truth I think she's jealous.
Because I fell in love with you.
And not her.
Ida, I love you.
We've been together for 14 wonderful years.
I truly believe we can make it work again.
Hello.
Tell them to wait.
Of course.
I'll take the next flight.
Bye.
That was my agent.
He's at Hamburg Airport waiting for me.
- You're leaving now?
- Come with me.
- No.
- Go on.
- I can't.
- Okay.
See you the day after tomorrow then.
JUST'S 50TH
Long live Just!
Cheers.
- Lovely weather.
- Sure.
I've been a good boy.
Don't I pay you to watch me?
I took the liberty of going home, because my job is done.
I left several messages for you at the hotel.
Here you go.
What happened to you?
- Who are they?
- Dutchmen.
The bald guy is Guus Jansen, 36, a known offender.
Convicted of assault and robbery.
The other guy is Rob Schmidt, 49 and I've traced him back to your brother, Martin Aumont.
They both belonged to the CLWG.
The Communist Liberation Work Group.
In 92 they were arrested in connection with a bomb scare in Rotterdam.
The evidence didn't hold up, so they were released.
Apparently the group has dissolved but it seems like the members have just regrouped.
- So it all comes back to my brother?
- Possibly.
This guy and another guy broke into our house last night.
Just is coming home tomorrow.
Please stake out the house until then.
Sure.
But I think you should go to the police.
I want to talk it over with Just, before I go to the police.
Okay.
If you say so.
And I don't want Just to see you.
But let me know the minute he returns.
It's Mariette.
- Hi.
Thanks for coming.
- Sure.
- I just grabbed something for you.
- Let me just ...
- You sounded upset on the phone.
- I'll explain later.
- Did you talk to Just?
- Yes.
He told me the two of you had been an item.
He said that?
- Well, it's true.
- Why didn't you tell me?
Because it's not the issue here.
Everything I told you about Just is true.
He's not right in the head.
Hello.
Now?
He wasn't due back till tomorrow.
Okay.
Thanks, HP.
I'm on my way.
Just is back.
I have to get home and explain everything.
Ida.
Take care, okay?
I promise.
Ida.
- Good evening.
- See anyone else?
Only your husband.
Anything else I can do for you?
- No.
- Take care.
HP.
Just?
I found an old list of CLWG members that just might interest you.
Just?
Where have you been?
I called you several times.
You don't answer your phone.
- Are you okay?
- Where have you been?
- I was with Mariette.
- No.
I went to her place, but there was no one there.
We went out.
What are you doing?
- Why are you lying to me?
- What do you mean?
Pierre.
Pierre Blanchare.
Who is he?
You're at it again, aren't you?
At what?
Why did you tell me you don't remember anything?
Huh?
- Why do you make a fool of me?
- I don't ...
Is it Pierre?
Is it Pierre, huh?
Are you fucking Pierre?
All I ever did was love you, and how do you repay me?
By leaving me!
You're destroying me.
Destroying me!
Don't you ever run away from me again.
Understand?
You lost a lot of blood, so we gave you a transfusion and we gave you seven stitches as well.
It was an accident.
I'm afraid you lost the baby.
The police are ready to talk to you when you feel up to it.
And your husband is on his way.
Are you in pain?
Here.
Take one of these.
You can only have half because it's heavy stuff.
There you go.
If you need a place to stay, I know this crisis center called the Nest.
I have to get to Rotterdam to see my brother.
Think that's a good idea?
Well, you need some clothes.
I have this.
It's probably too big, but it's all Rosie has to offer.
Rosie.
That's my name.
Rosie.
What's your name?
Ida.
Ida.
Your ticket's in the front pocket.
If you change your mind, you can find me at the Nest.
Thanks a lot.
Us girls have to stick together, don't we?
Martin?
- Martin!
- Ida, get in!
I've got to go now.
Me too.
The police have nothing to go on in the case of the HD Bank robbery.
They have no leads to the five robbers who got away with 6m euros.
If you saw anything strange in and around Amsterdam on August 11th ...
Good morning.
- What the hell's going on, Martin?
- Who cut you up?
- Who were those people?
- Let me worry about that.
What happened this time?
I was going to leave him.
Again?
You're on the run, aren't you?
- Take me with you.
- No way.
No.
- I'm not going back.
- You always go back.
Prick!
- What did he say?
- They want their money.
- So what are we going to do?
- Find Martin, for fuck's sake!
She's my sister, damn it.
You're in my thoughts too.
Bye.
- He's in love with you.
- I've known him for ages.
I doubt it.
Bobo?
I want you to make a drawing of me for my boyfriend.
- You know I gave up drawing.
- You'll just have to take it up again.
- I can't come without a gift.
- Who is your boyfriend?
A bad boy.
Lift your head.
- Are you still in that activist group?
- No.
How about the robbery?
- Those men didn't look like cops.
- It's best to keep you in the dark.
I'm trying to start over, make a new life for myself.
Can you?
Can you?
Draw.
Hi, Guus.
It's Ron.
Wake up.
Grab your stuff.
We're leaving.
- What's up?
- We can't stay here.
- Is Tim back?
- No, and we can't wait any longer.
Move over!
Get him out!
Get him out!
What the hell are you doing?
What are you doing?
You hit him!
Stop the car!
Martin!
- Stop!
- Get down!
Down!
Down!
- Is this how you live your life?
- Yeah.
More or less.
Why?
You want to go home?
You didn't answer my question.
At some point I realized I was guided by the wrong principles.
How so?
The money from the robbery was meant for arms for the Middle East.
- I took off with the money.
- Have you gone insane?
Ever heard of Ugo Marshall?
Sure.
The politician behind the aid programs.
Ugo Marshall is your boyfriend?
My drawing is for him?
He's the best thing that ever happened to me.
I know he'll use the money to give lots of people a better life.
- Still no answer.
- Doesn't he have a cell phone?
Sure, but he doesn't use it outside work.
- So now what?
- We keep going.
- Well?
- He's stubborn.
If he knew they were at the hotel, he knows where they went, too.
Make him talk.
Oh, for fuck's sake!
Not now!
Come on, come on.
Fuck!
Are we in France?
- Fucking car!
- Relax.
So go past me!
Can't you fix it?
If only you hadn't shown up, we wouldn't be in this fucking car.
Hey, baby.
Damn, am I glad to hear your voice.
Is everything okay?
No, we're not far away.
But you're not safe there.
Pack your stuff and be ready.
- There.
- Thanks.
What's going on in there?
I was pregnant.
Christ, Bobo.
He refused to believe it was his.
Why do you let him do this?
I love him.
2,50 euros.
Anything else?
- Have you got a phone?
- Downstairs next to the bathrooms.
This is Just Ore.
Please leave a message.
Who are you calling?
Nobody.
You called home.
Did you call home?
- You're so fucking stupid!
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I never should've come.
- I can't go with you.
- You're going to stay here or what?
You're going back?
I don't fucking believe it.
- I don't have time for this.
Let's go.
- No, no, no!
Don't you get it?
Don't you get who's after me?
I was supposed to give Just the money.
He was too violent for the CLWG.
Now he's fallen in with a tougher crowd and they will kill you, if they find out you're in the know.
What will it take to make you leave that psycho?
Good luck, Bobo.
Martin!
- Anything wrong?
- No.
I just want to make sure.
Everything looks fine.
Wait here.
No!
No!
Martin?
Martin, they're still here.
Martin, let's get out of here.
We need to get out of here.
He's dead.
Let's go.
We need to get out of here, Martin.
Run for the woods.
Head down.
Now!
Martin?
Ida.
Martin?
Come here.
What's going on, Martin?
Take the money and get out of here.
- What about you?
- Promise you won't go back to him.
Just promise me you won't go back.
Go, Bobo.
Good luck.
Guus!
Help!
Save me from those men ...
- What are you doing here, Monsieur?
- Save me from those men!
It's dangerous here.
Go back.
Monsieur ...
Help me.
Help!
Some men are ...
Ida?
Are you okay?
The police confirm that Just Ore was killed in a home robbery last week.
The robbers presumably thought he had large sums of money at home.
Thus the police rule out other theories of a contract killing.
In the Netherlands the police have recovered most of the money ...

- Chain Reaction subtitles by Apollo corrections webdl by f1nc0
[Traditional Chinese music]
[Dramatically] The two legendary warriors strode bravely towards danger, cutting through the thick fog like it was... soup.
Dangerous, evil soup.
The two best friends had been through much that day:
An epic march, a treacherous scouting mission, the nearby shop being out of friendship bracelets, and one of the two...
unimportant, which one... refusing to wear them anyway!
But they were about to face their most fearsome part yet...
Mr. Yang.
They must pay Mr. Yang, the grumpy statue cleaner, and return with their prize,
Shifu's favorite ruby-encrusted statue of Ugwei, which had grown dirty from the fearsome assault of time and dust and dry rice spits dropped on it, accidentally and with great pomp, the processional proceeded to progress.
Never before had such a magnificent caravan of awesomeness trekked through these hinterlands of what... of the... with...
What's the word?
- Po!
- No, that's not it.
Po, you're doing it again.
Quit daydreaming out loud.
Well, I wouldn't do it if you'd just talk to me a little.
Po, we're on a mission.
Okay.
Okay, then.
Just mission-critical stuff.
Super-important mission stuff.
- Fine.
- Like... [Gasps]
What's your favorite color?
[Groans]
For me, I guess maybe blue.
Yeah, it's all steely and cold, like me.
Ooh, but I like red.
Yeah, 'cause red's all fire.
Hmm, of course there's yellow.
Yellow's all friendly, like sunshine and mustard and...
Gah, this is hard!
They're all so great.
Why can't there be one color that's so much more awesome than the other colors, it's, like, no contest?
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
It could be, like, a color you've never heard of, like grank or lipp or flugu or something.
"Hey, hey, what's your favorite color?"
"Flugu." "Wow, so's mine!"
"Hey, nice shade of flugu."
"Thanks, it's my favorite color."
"Mine too!"
Might bring a little peace to the... uni... verse.
No?
Not a fan of the flugu?
I have a rule about idle chitchat.
I don't do it.
You have a rule about everything.
If we're going to be best friends, like the way I dreamed about since I was five, you're going to have to loosen up.
Look, I say this with complete respect.
I don't have a favorite color.
I don't have a favorite mushroom.
- Shiitake.
- I don't know any dwarves.
And when we get back, I'm taking a monthly vow of solitude...
- Alone.
- Fine.
I mean, that's how I like my solitude:
Alone.
With maybe cream.
[Groans]
In another quarter mile, we can eat that lunch we packed.
Oh, um...
was that for both of us?
Po!
Hold it.
Push.
Huh?
[Gasps] Croc bandits.
Hey, there, pretty lady.
- I am a boy.
- He meant me.
Wow, that was easy.
Take the statue, and get the ruby.
You'll take nothing.
Ooh!
Yeah.
What she said.
Shakabu...
[Laughter]
[Sighs]
Looks like we're going to do this the hard way.
Get off the chain.
Use... gah!
...
leave... ooh!
...
Other... backhand.
I'm stuck.
Get it off.
Come on.
I don't want to be a downer, but we can't fight them like this.
We took an oath to protect this statue.
Capture them.
Spears!
Uh, got a feeling we don't want to get captured here.
I'm not changing anything.
I'm saving the statue.
We can take them.
Good idea, but first...
let's not die.
- Don't be mad.
- Why would I be...
Oh, no.
[Both screaming]
Bad idea!
Bad idea!
- No kidding!
- Try lending a hand next time.
Both:
Ooh!
Ooh!
- Stop doing that.
- Me?
Ooh!
[Sighs]
You know, up close, your face looks kind of angry.
Little lines right here and here.
Get off!
Ooh!
Ooh.
Oh.
Is there a way of doing this that doesn't involve kicking me?
Yes.
Ooh!
Oh, I see, a new plan.
I was about to suggest...
[Screams]
Ooh.
Hold on.
"Hold on"?
Let me explain handcuffs to you.
Of course.
[Both screaming]
[Birds fluttering]
Hey, thought that would be a serious bone-cruncher.
How about you, Tigress?
Uh, Tigress?
[Muffled speech]
[Screams]
Tigress, wake up.
Show me how to revive you!
Okay, not sure that works.
Po, when you're chained to someone and you jump off a cliff, get them to agree to it first!
That's the protocol.
There's a protocol for that?
Who knew?
Next, you're going to tell me there's a protocol for a three-foot-tall rooster holding a battle ax and a banana.
Approach from the battle ax side.
The banana's a decoy.
[Laughs] That's a good... one.
Uh, right, got it.
I'll write that down in my...
log.
Oh, I can't believe we lost the statue and the ruby.
Oh, did we?
Ah!
Uh, I mean...
Did we?
You got it?
I grabbed it when the statue fell, without a plan.
Imagine that.
I guess they were too busy punching me in the face to notice.
Losers.
Well, when they do notice, they'll be after us.
- Let's head that way.
- Ooh!
Where's the ruby?
No, seriously... wait.
No, no.
Where's the ru...
where's the ru...
Okay.
Okay, all right.
Funny joke, guys.
Now give me the ruby.
Um...
We don't have it.
I think I saw the panda take it.
That's great.
No, that's great, that you watched that happen.
That's really...
You know what?
You've got a keen eye.
I've... did anybody ever tell you that?
That's... next time, though?
Yeah?
Next time, maybe you could stop him!
Now get that ruby back!
[Muttering]
Slow down.
This is kind of awesome, isn't it?
Po and Tigress together on an adventure, just the way I'd always hoped it would be.
If you count getting handcuffed, robbed, yanked off a cliff, and failing at the mission as awesome, then yes, it's been awesome.
What's next?
We're going to get the statue back.
Oh, well, we can't do anything until we get these chains off.
[Gasps] I got an idea.
Ah!
All right.
Pull on "three."
- Ready?
- Ready.
Three.
I... ooh!
...
don't... ee!
... think...
Ah!
... it's working.
You don't just yell "three" when you say "on three."
You actually have to count to three.
Never heard that before.
Run!
Ow!
- No, no, this way.
- Why would we run that way?
You always break toward cover.
Of course, proper fleeing etiquette.
I must have missed that day.
Whoa!
Oof.
- Do you see them?
- It's hard to tell.
They're crocodiles.
It's like an alligator with a different snout.
I know what they are.
If you see any large reptiles, the code word is "pudding."
I think we lost 'em.
We should name our adventure.
Yeah.
You know how Shifu tells the story of Ugwei and the fiery demons of Wu Zhong mountain?
We should have a name.
Yeah, how about "the fiery demons of stop talking"?
Oh, oh, oh!
We can have a song too, like:
♪ Bow chicka dow ja-dong-adong, beeee!
♪
♪ The Furious Two ♪
♪ They're going on a rampage ♪
[Whispers] Dumplings.
Where?
[Screams]
You mean "pudding."
Ow!
What are you doing?
You said you always break towards cover.
Unless you break towards higher ground.
When did running away get so complicated?
[Whispers] We lost them.
Huh!
Hey, that's a nice bell.
See, this is the great thing about traveling.
You see things you'd never see at home.
Believe it or not, Po, I've seen a bell before.
I'm getting the impression you're not having as good a time as I am.
Getting out of these cuffs will be my good time.
And that bell could cut the chain.
Great.
Time to lose the jewelry.
See what I did there?
I called the cuffs "jewelry."
Yeah, I got it.
Uh, okay.
Uh, you're the planner, so all the planning is covered with your plan, right?
Right.
[Bell tolls]
Mama.
[Bell reverberating]
Ahhhhhhh.
[Yells] Did it work?
Shh!
Keep your voice down.
What?
I can't hear anything!
What words am I saying?
I think they got away.
Argh!
Darn it, guys.
We talked about this.
Remember, we gave ourselves one year to be real bandits.
We're 11 months in.
If I have to go back to carving terra-cotta warriors for my dad...
I am whispering!
That's the panda.
We're back in business.
Eat it, dad!
- What?
- Stop shouting.
It is cloudy, but we need to get out of here!
Can you focus, please?
Come on;
They're in here.
Hit it again.
Ooh!
Hit it.
Hit it again.
Hit it again!
Hit it!
Hit it!
Hit it!
Hit it!
Hit it!
What's wrong?
- Brace yourself.
- Really?
[Sniffs] You think so?
Brace... your... self.
Whoaaaa!
Darn it, guys!
Oh!
I can't think.
I haven't eaten all day.
Really?
We ate lunch.
I ate lunch.
I ate your lunch.
Right.
Oh, ho, ho, lookee here.
I'm just gonna climb up that...
I'm just gonna...
big belly in the way.
Don't mind if I do.
It's time for the crazy feet.
Whoa!
Ooh!
Panda!
I can't believe you did that.
Ugh!
All I wanted was something... to... eat.
You're welcome.
Thanks, Po.
Whoa, there's a lot of honey in this tree.
Bees produce more than they eat.
No.
Huh!
You know a lot of stuff.
I studied...
for a long time.
What about friends?
My friends are the twins discipline and sacrifice.
I don't think they'd like me.
That's okay.
You'll never meet them.
Ha ha!
Oh, you!
You made a funny.
That was funny, wasn't it?
It has meaning on two levels.
You can't meet them, because they're an abstract idea, and you won't, because you're lazy...
Yeah, okay.
Now you're just wrecking it.
Right.
Um, can I ask you something?
You, uh, wanted to be the Dragon Warrior, didn't you?
Everyone wanted to be the Dragon Warrior.
But things don't always turn out the way you think.
You think Ugwei made the wrong choice.
Okay, yeah.
Fire's getting a little low.
[Fire whooshes] Po!
I was carving a key to get the shackles opened.
I worked hours on that thing.
I...
I thought it was firewood.
You didn't think at all.
You never do, Dragon Warrior.
I'm just trying to...
Do what?
Trying to do what?
Lose the statue?
Fumble through everything?
Is that the Dragon Warrior way?
Maybe Ugwei did make the wrong choice.
Tigress, you may be a great warrior, but you stink at friendship and fun... ship.
I'm out of here.
The handcuffs.
The honey must have slipped the cuff off.
Tigress, we're free!
Is there nothing honey can't do?
Po.
Po?
[Crocodiles snarling]
Tigress, we did it.
Tigress?
Tigress!
Look, you got a job to do.
I got a job to do.
So why don't you just tell me where the ruby is?
Or what?
You're going to play good croc/bad croc?
You're going down!
I'm not playing these games with you anymore!
Forget it, Gary.
She knows.
Oh, okay.
Well, I guess
I'll clean up these weapons now.
And it's Gah-ri.
Ugh!
[Crash!
]
If you don't want to tell us, fine.
Then we'll do this the hard way.
You already said that.
That's twice now.
Hey!
[Stammering]
It's... it's a good line, so shut up.
It is a good line.
Now, where was I?
I think you were going to yammer on and I was going to do this.
[Groaning]
Darn it!
Oh, everybody back up.
Just back up, 'cause she's got a vicious kick.
Oh, who didn't tie her up below the knees?
Come on, guys.
This is basic stuff.
[Chuckles]
Okay.
That's it.
I'm done going easy on you.
Let me guess...
you're going to do it the hard way.
[Laughs]
Bring it, boys.
Ha ha ha.
Prepare to be torn to pieces.
Huh?
It's facing the wrong way!
Wha... wait... no.
Roll it back out.
Turn around...
Keep preparing to be torn to pieces.
[Muttering] Just hold on a second.
They're everywhere.
I need a plan.
Ow!
There's an intruder in the woods.
Find him!
Looks like we're doing this the hard way.
[Groaning]
Darn it!
Po.
- Po, listen, I...
- You okay?
Let's get you and the statue out of here.
I'm surprised you came back for me.
Thanks.
Well, it's protocol.
You know, for friends.
On three.
Three!
Ha!
We're surrounded.
You take half.
I'll take half.
- I'll get the statue.
- I got it.
- Po.
- Oh, right.
Sorry.
Huh!
Ha!
[Clank!
]
Oof!
Oof!
Welcome to the fist-ival.
Allow me to punch your tickets.
Can't... hold on.
Tigress!
Know what we need?
A plan.
We need to do this together.
[Metal clanks]
- Why'd you do that?
- Because you're right.
Both:
Together!
On three.
Both:
Three!
How about a little flying panda style?
Ha!
[Applause]
Nice job.
No, impressive.
But I've got the statue, and you've got the... ruby?
No, I don't think so.
I have it right here.
Look at that.
Ha ha ha!
No!
Darn it!
Ha!
Huh!
Ha!
[Screaming]
- Nice work.
- You too.
- Know what?
- What?
Ugwei did make the right choice,
Dragon Warrior.
Really?
Really?
Oh, wow!
I love that you just said that.

SWEET.
- [dramatically] THE TWO LEGENDARY WARRIORS
STRODE BRAVELY TOWARDS DANGER,
CUTTING THROUGH THE THICK FOG LIKE IT WAS...
SOUP.
DANGEROUS, EVIL SOUP.
THE TWO BEST FRIENDS HAD BEEN THROUGH MUCH THAT DAY:
AN EPIC MARCH, A TREACHEROUS SCOUTING MISSION,
THE NEARBY SHOP BEING OUT OF FRIENDSHIP BRACELETS,
AND ONE OF THE TWO-- UNIMPORTANT, WHICH ONE--
REFUSING TO WEAR THEM ANYWAY!
BUT THEY WERE ABOUT TO FACE
THEIR MOST FEARSOME PART YET...
MR. YANG.
THEY MUST PAY MR. YANG, THE GRUMPY STATUE CLEANER,
AND RETURN WITH THEIR PRIZE,
SHIFU'S FAVORITE RUBY-ENCRUSTED STATUE OF UGWEI,
WHICH HAD GROWN DIRTY FROM THE FEARSOME ASSAULT OF TIME
AND DUST
AND DRIED RICE BITS DROPPED ON IT...
ACCIDENTALLY.
AND WITH GREAT POMP,
THE PROCESSIONAL PROCEEDED TO PROGRESS.
NEVER BEFORE
HAD SUCH A MAGNIFICENT CARAVAN OF AWESOMENESS
TREKKED THROUGH THESE HINTERLANDS
OF WHAT--OF THE--WITH--
WHAT'S THE WORD?
- PO!
- NO, THAT'S NOT IT.
- PO, YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN.
QUIT DAYDREAMING OUT LOUD.
- WELL, I WOULDN'T DO IT IF YOU'D JUST TALK TO ME A LITTLE.
- PO, WE'RE ON A MISSION.
- OKAY.
OKAY, THEN.
JUST MISSION-CRITICAL STUFF.
SUPER-IMPORTANT MISSION STUFF.
- FINE.
- LIKE...
[gasps]
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE COLOR?
- [groans]
- FOR ME, I GUESS MAYBE BLUE.
YEAH, IT'S ALL STEELY AND COLD, LIKE ME.
OOH, BUT I LIKE RED.
YEAH, 'CAUSE RED'S ALL FIRE.
HMM, OF COURSE THERE'S YELLOW.
YELLOW'S ALL FRIENDLY, LIKE SUNSHINE AND MUSTARD AND--
GAH, THIS IS HARD!
THEY'RE ALL SO GREAT.
WHY CAN'T THERE BE ONE COLOR THAT'S SO MUCH MORE AWESOME
THAN THE OTHER COLORS, IT'S, LIKE, NO CONTEST?
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!
IT COULD BE, LIKE, A COLOR YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF,
LIKE GRANK OR LIPP OR FLUGU OR SOMETHING.
"HEY, HEY, WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE COLOR?"
"FLUGU." "WOW, SO'S MINE!"
"HEY, NICE SHADE OF FLUGU."
"THANKS, IT'S MY FAVORITE COLOR."
"MINE TOO!"
MIGHT BRING A LITTLE PEACE
TO THE...
UNIVERSE.
NO?
NOT A FAN OF THE FLUGU?
- I HAVE A RULE ABOUT IDLE CHITCHAT.
I DON'T DO IT.
- YOU HAVE A RULE ABOUT EVERYTHING.
IF WE'RE GOING TO BE BEST FRIENDS,
LIKE THE WAY I DREAMED ABOUT SINCE I WAS FIVE,
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOSEN UP.
- LOOK, I SAY THIS WITH COMPLETE RESPECT.
I DON'T HAVE A FAVORITE COLOR.
I DON'T HAVE A FAVORITE MUSHROOM.
- SHIITAKE.
- I DON'T KNOW ANY DWARVES.
AND WHEN WE GET BACK, I'M TAKING A MONTHLY VOW OF SOLITUDE...
ALONE.
- FINE.
I MEAN, THAT'S HOW I LIKE MY SOLITUDE:
ALONE.
WITH MAYBE CREAM.
- [groans]
IN ANOTHER QUARTER MILE, WE CAN EAT THAT LUNCH WE PACKED.
- OH, UM...
WAS THAT FOR BOTH OF US?
- PO!
HOLD IT.
PUSH.
- HUH?
[gasps] CROC BANDITS.
- HEY, THERE, PRETTY LADY.
- I AM A BOY.
- HE MEANT ME.
- WOW, THAT WAS EASY.
- TAKE THE STATUE, AND GET THE RUBY.
- YOU'LL TAKE NOTHING.
OOH!
- YEAH.
WHAT SHE SAID.
SHAKABU-- [laughter]
- [sighs]
- LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS THE HARD WAY.
- GET OFF THE CHAIN.
USE--GAH!
--LEAVE--OOH!
--
OTHER--BACKHAND.
- I'M STUCK.
- GET IT OFF.
COME ON.
- I DON'T WANT TO BE A DOWNER,
BUT WE CAN'T FIGHT THEM LIKE THIS.
- WE TOOK AN OATH TO PROTECT THIS STATUE.
- CAPTURE THEM.
SPEARS!
- UH, GOT A FEELING WE DON'T WANT TO GET CAPTURED HERE.
- I'M NOT CHANGING ANYTHING.
I'M SAVING THE STATUE.
WE CAN TAKE THEM.
- GOOD IDEA, BUT FIRST...
LET'S NOT DIE.
DON'T BE MAD.
- WHY WOULD I BE--
OH, NO.
[both screaming]
- BAD IDEA!
BAD IDEA!
- NO KIDDING!
- TRY LENDING A HAND NEXT TIME.
both:
OOH!
OOH!
- STOP DOING THAT.
- ME?
- OOH!
- [sighs]
YOU KNOW, UP CLOSE, YOUR FACE LOOKS KIND OF ANGRY.
LITTLE LINES RIGHT HERE AND HERE.
- GET OFF!
- OOH!
OOH.
OH.
IS THERE A WAY OF DOING THIS
THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE KICKING ME?
- YES.
- OOH!
OH, I SEE, A NEW PLAN.
I WAS ABOUT TO SUGGEST-- [screams]
- OOH.
- HOLD ON.
- "HOLD ON"?
LET ME EXPLAIN HANDCUFFS TO YOU.
OF COURSE.
[both screaming] [birds fluttering]
- HEY, THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE A SERIOUS BONE-CRUNCHER.
HOW ABOUT YOU, TIGRESS?
UH, TIGRESS?
- [muffled speech]
- [screams]
TIGRESS, WAKE UP.
SHOW ME HOW TO REVIVE YOU!
OKAY, NOT SURE THAT WORKS.
- PO, WHEN YOU'RE CHAINED TO SOMEONE
AND YOU JUMP OFF A CLIFF,
GET THEM TO AGREE TO IT FIRST.
THAT'S THE PROTOCOL.
- THERE'S A PROTOCOL FOR THAT?
WHO KNEW?
NEXT, YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME THERE'S A PROTOCOL
FOR A THREE-FOOT-TALL ROOSTER
HOLDING A BATTLE AX AND A BANANA.
- APPROACH FROM THE BATTLE AX SIDE.
THE BANANA'S A DECOY.
- [laughs] THAT'S A GOOD...
ONE.
UH, RIGHT, GOT IT.
I'LL WRITE THAT DOWN IN MY LOG.
- OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE WE LOST THE STATUE
AND THE RUBY.
- OH, DID WE?
AH!
UH, I MEAN...
DID WE?
- YOU GOT IT?
- I GRABBED IT WHEN THE STATUE FELL,
WITHOUT A PLAN.
IMAGINE THAT.
I GUESS THEY WERE TOO BUSY PUNCHING ME IN THE FACE
TO NOTICE.
LOSERS.
- WELL, WHEN THEY DO NOTICE, THEY'LL BE AFTER US.
LET'S HEAD THAT WAY.
- OOH!
- WHERE'S THE RUBY?
NO, SERIOUSLY--WAIT.
NO, NO.
WHERE'S THE RU--WHERE'S THE RU--
OKAY.
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
FUNNY JOKE, GUYS.
NOW GIVE ME THE RUBY.
- UM...
WE DON'T HAVE IT.
I THINK I SAW THE PANDA TAKE IT.
- THAT'S GREAT.
NO, THAT'S GREAT,
THAT YOU WATCHED THAT HAPPEN.
THAT'S REALLY-- YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'VE GOT A KEEN EYE.
I'VE--DID ANYBODY EVER TELL YOU THAT?
THAT'S--NEXT TIME, THOUGH?
- YEAH?
- NEXT TIME, MAYBE YOU COULD STOP HIM.
NOW GET THAT RUBY BACK!
- [muttering]
SLOW DOWN.
THIS IS KIND OF AWESOME, ISN'T IT?
PO AND TIGRESS TOGETHER ON AN ADVENTURE,
JUST THE WAY I'D ALWAYS HOPED IT WOULD BE.
- IF YOU COUNT GETTING HANDCUFFED, ROBBED,
YANKED OFF A CLIFF, AND FAILING AT THE MISSION AS AWESOME,
THEN YES, IT'S BEEN AWESOME.
WHAT'S NEXT?
- WE'RE GOING TO GET THE STATUE BACK.
- OH, WELL,
WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL WE GET THESE CHAINS OFF.
- [gasps] I GOT AN IDEA.
- AH!
- ALL RIGHT.
PULL ON "THREE."
READY?
- READY.
- THREE.
- I--OOH!
--DON'T--EE!
--THINK--
AH!
--IT'S WORKING.
YOU DON'T JUST YELL "THREE" WHEN YOU SAY "ON THREE."
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO COUNT TO THREE.
- NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE.
RUN!
OW!
NO, NO, THIS WAY.
- WHY WOULD WE RUN THAT WAY?
YOU ALWAYS BREAK TOWARD COVER.
- OF COURSE, PROPER FLEEING ETIQUETTE.
I MUST HAVE MISSED THAT DAY.
WHOA!
OOF.
DO YOU SEE THEM?
- IT'S HARD TO TELL.
- THEY'RE CROCODILES.
IT'S LIKE AN ALLIGATOR WITH A DIFFERENT SNOUT.
- I KNOW WHAT THEY ARE.
- IF YOU SEE ANY LARGE REPTILES, THE CODE WORD IS "PUDDING."
- I THINK WE LOST 'EM.
- WE SHOULD NAME OUR ADVENTURE.
YEAH.
YOU KNOW HOW SHIFU TELLS THE STORY OF UGWEI
AND THE FIERY DEMONS OF WU ZHONG MOUNTAIN?
WE SHOULD HAVE A NAME.
- YEAH, HOW ABOUT "THE FIERY DEMONS OF STOP TALKING"?
- OH, OH, OH!
WE CAN HAVE A SONG TOO, LIKE:
¶ BOW CHICKA DOW JA-DONG-ADONG, BEEEE!
¶
¶ THE FURIOUS TWO ¶
¶ THEY'RE GOING ON A RAMPAGE ¶
- [whispers] DUMPLINGS.
- WHERE?
[screams]
YOU MEAN "PUDDING."
OW!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU SAID YOU ALWAYS BREAK TOWARDS COVER.
- UNLESS YOU BREAK TOWARDS HIGHER GROUND.
- WHEN DID RUNNING AWAY GET SO COMPLICATED?
[whispers] WE LOST THEM.
HUH!
HEY, THAT'S A NICE BELL.
SEE, THIS IS THE GREAT THING ABOUT TRAVELING.
YOU SEE THINGS YOU'D NEVER SEE AT HOME.
- BELIEVE IT OR NOT, PO, I'VE SEEN A BELL BEFORE.
- I'M GETTING THE IMPRESSION
YOU'RE NOT HAVING AS GOOD A TIME AS I AM.
- GETTING OUT OF THESE CUFFS WILL BE MY GOOD TIME.
AND THAT BELL COULD CUT THE CHAIN.
- GREAT.
TIME TO LOSE THE JEWELRY.
SEE WHAT I DID THERE?
I CALLED THE CUFFS "JEWELRY."
- YEAH, I GOT IT.
- UH, OKAY.
UH, YOU'RE THE PLANNER,
SO ALL THE PLANNING IS COVERED WITH YOUR PLAN, RIGHT?
- RIGHT.
[bell tolls]
- MAMA.
[bell reverberating]
- AHHHHHHH.
[yells] DID IT WORK?
- SHH!
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.
- WHAT?
I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING!
WHAT WORDS AM I SAYING?
- I THINK THEY GOT AWAY.
ARGH!
DARN IT, GUYS.
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.
REMEMBER, WE GAVE OURSELVES ONE YEAR TO BE REAL BANDITS.
WE'RE 11 MONTHS IN.
IF I HAVE TO GO BACK TO CARVING TERRA-COTTA WARRIORS
FOR MY DAD--
- I AM WHISPERING!
- THAT'S THE PANDA.
WE'RE BACK IN BUSINESS.
EAT IT, DAD!
- WHAT?
- STOP SHOUTING.
- IT IS CLOUDY, BUT WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE!
CAN YOU FOCUS, PLEASE?
- COME ON;
THEY'RE IN HERE.
HIT IT AGAIN.
- OOH!
- HIT IT.
HIT IT AGAIN.
HIT IT AGAIN!
HIT IT!
HIT IT!
HIT IT!
HIT IT!
HIT IT!
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- BRACE YOURSELF.
- REALLY?
[sniffs] YOU THINK SO?
- BRACE...
YOUR...
SELF.
- WHOAAAA!
- DARN IT, GUYS!
OH!
- I CAN'T THINK.
I HAVEN'T EATEN ALL DAY.
- REALLY?
WE ATE LUNCH.
I ATE LUNCH.
I ATE YOUR LUNCH.
RIGHT.
OH, HO, HO, LOOKEE HERE.
I'M JUST GONNA CLIMB UP THAT--
I'M JUST GONNA--
BIG BELLY IN THE WAY.
DON'T MIND IF I DO.
IT'S TIME FOR THE CRAZY FEET.
WHOA!
- OOH!
PANDA!
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THAT.
UGH!
ALL I WANTED WAS SOMETHING...
TO...
EAT.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
- THANKS, PO.
- WHOA, THERE'S A LOT OF HONEY IN THIS TREE.
- BEES PRODUCE MORE THAN THEY EAT.
- NO.
HUH!
YOU KNOW A LOT OF STUFF.
- I STUDIED...
FOR A LONG TIME.
- WHAT ABOUT FRIENDS?
- MY FRIENDS ARE THE TWINS DISCIPLINE AND SACRIFICE.
- I DON'T THINK THEY'D LIKE ME.
- THAT'S OKAY.
YOU'LL NEVER MEET THEM.
- HA HA!
OH, YOU!
YOU MADE A FUNNY.
- THAT WAS FUNNY, WASN'T IT?
IT HAS MEANING ON TWO LEVELS.
YOU CAN'T MEET THEM, BECAUSE THEY'RE AN ABSTRACT IDEA,
AND YOU WON'T, BECAUSE YOU'RE LAZY--
- YEAH, OKAY.
NOW YOU'RE JUST WRECKING IT.
- RIGHT.
- UM, CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
YOU, UH, WANTED TO BE THE DRAGON WARRIOR, DIDN'T YOU?
- EVERYONE WANTED TO BE THE DRAGON WARRIOR.
BUT THINGS DON'T ALWAYS TURN OUT THE WAY YOU THINK.
- YOU THINK UGWEI MADE THE WRONG CHOICE.
OKAY, YEAH.
FIRE'S GETTING A LITTLE LOW.
[fire whooshes]
- PO!
I WAS CARVING A KEY TO GET THE SHACKLES OPENED.
I WORKED HOURS ON THAT THING.
- I--I THOUGHT IT WAS FIREWOOD.
- YOU DIDN'T THINK AT ALL.
YOU NEVER DO, DRAGON WARRIOR.
- I'M JUST TRYING TO--
- DO WHAT?
TRYING TO DO WHAT?
LOSE THE STATUE?
FUMBLE THROUGH EVERYTHING?
IS THAT THE DRAGON WARRIOR WAY?
MAYBE UGWEI DID MAKE THE WRONG CHOICE.
- TIGRESS, YOU MAY BE A GREAT WARRIOR,
BUT YOU STINK AT FRIENDSHIP
AND FUN...
SHIP.
I'M OUT OF HERE.
THE HANDCUFFS.
THE HONEY MUST HAVE SLIPPED THE CUFF OFF.
TIGRESS, WE'RE FREE!
IS THERE NOTHING HONEY CAN'T DO?
PO.
PO?
[crocodiles snarling]
- TIGRESS, WE DID IT.
TIGRESS?
TIGRESS!
- LOOK, YOU GOT A JOB TO DO.
I GOT A JOB TO DO.
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL ME WHERE THE RUBY IS?
- OR WHAT?
YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY GOOD CROC/BAD CROC?
- YOU'RE GOING DOWN!
I'M NOT PLAYING THESE GAMES WITH YOU ANYMORE!
- FORGET IT, GARY.
SHE KNOWS.
- OH, OKAY.
WELL, I GUESS I'LL CLEAN UP THESE WEAPONS NOW.
AND IT'S GAH-RI.
- UGH!
crash!
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL US, FINE.
THEN WE'LL DO THIS THE HARD WAY.
- YOU ALREADY SAID THAT.
THAT'S TWICE NOW.
- HEY!
[stammering]
IT'S--IT'S A GOOD LINE, SO SHUT UP.
- IT IS A GOOD LINE.
- NOW, WHERE WAS I?
- I THINK YOU WERE GOING TO YAMMER ON
AND I WAS GOING TO DO THIS.
- [groaning]
DARN IT!
OH, EVERYBODY BACK UP.
JUST BACK UP.
JUST BACK UP, 'CAUSE SHE'S GOT A VICIOUS KICK.
OH, WHO DIDN'T TIE HER UP BELOW THE KNEES?
COME ON, GUYS.
THIS IS BASIC STUFF.
[chuckles]
OKAY.
THAT'S IT.
I'M DONE GOING EASY ON YOU.
- LET ME GUESS;
YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT THE HARD WAY.
[laughs]
BRING IT, BOYS.
HA HA HA.
PREPARE TO BE TORN TO PIECES.
HUH?
IT'S FACING THE WRONG WAY!
WHA--WAIT--NO.
ROLL IT BACK OUT.
TURN AROUND--
KEEP PREPARING TO BE TORN TO PIECES.
[muttering] JUST HOLD ON A SECOND.
- THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.
I NEED A PLAN.
OW!
- THERE'S AN INTRUDER IN THE WOODS.
FIND HIM!
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE DOING THIS THE HARD WAY.
[groaning]
DARN IT!
- PO.
PO, LISTEN, I--
- YOU OKAY?
LET'S GET YOU AND THE STATUE OUT OF HERE.
- I'M SURPRISED YOU CAME BACK FOR ME.
THANKS.
- WELL, IT'S PROTOCOL.
YOU KNOW, FOR FRIENDS.
ON THREE.
THREE!
HA!
- WE'RE SURROUNDED.
- YOU TAKE HALF.
I'LL TAKE HALF.

- OH, RIGHT.
SORRY.
HUH!
HA!
clank!
- OOF!
OOF!
WELCOME TO THE FIST-IVAL.
ALLOW ME TO PUNCH YOUR TICKETS.
- CAN'T...
HOLD ON.
- TIGRESS!
- KNOW WHAT WE NEED?
A PLAN.
WE NEED TO DO THIS TOGETHER.
[metal clanks]
WHY'D YOU DO THAT?
- BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT.
both:
TOGETHER!
- ON THREE.
both:
THREE!
- HOW ABOUT A LITTLE FLYING PANDA STYLE?
HA!
[applause]
- NICE JOB.
NO, IMPRESSIVE.
BUT I'VE GOT THE STATUE, AND YOU'VE GOT THE...
RUBY?
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE.

Sweet.
- [Dramatically] the two legendary warriors
Strode bravely towards danger,
Cutting through the thick fog like it was... soup.
Dangerous, evil soup.
The two best friends had been through much that day:
An epic march, a treacherous scouting mission,
The nearby shop being out of friendship bracelets,
And one of the two-- Unimportant, which one--
Refusing to wear them anyway!
But they were about to face
Their most fearsome part yet...
Mr. Yang.
They must pay mr.
Yang, the grumpy statue cleaner,
And return with their prize,
Shifu's favorite ruby-Encrusted statue of ugwei,
Which had grown dirty from the fearsome assault of time
And with great pomp,
The processional proceeded to progress.
Never before
Had such a magnificent caravan of awesomeness
Trekked through these hinterlands
Of what--Of the--With--
What's the word?
- Po!
- No, that's not it.
- Po, you're doing it again.
Quit daydreaming out loud.
- Well, i wouldn't do it if you'd just talk to me a little.
- Po, we're on a mission.
- Okay.
Okay, then.
Just mission-Critical stuff.
Super-Important mission stuff.
- Fine.
- Like...
[gasps]
What's your favorite color?
- [Groans]
- For me, i guess maybe blue.
Yeah, it's all steely and cold, like me.
Ooh, but i like red.
Yeah, 'cause red's all fire.
Hmm, of course there's yellow.
Yellow's all friendly, like sunshine and mustard and--
Gah, this is hard!
They're all so great.
Why can't there be one color that's so much more awesome
Than the other colors, it's, like, no contest?
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
It could be, like, a color you've never heard of,
Like grank or lipp or flugu or something.
"Hey, hey, what's your favorite color?"
"Flugu." "Wow, so's mine!"
"Hey, nice shade of flugu."
"Thanks, it's my favorite color."
"Mine too!"
Might bring a little peace
To the...universe.
No?
Not a fan of the flugu?
- I have a rule about idle chitchat.
I don't do it.
- You have a rule about everything.
If we're going to be best friends,
Like the way i dreamed about since i was five,
You're going to have to loosen up.
- Look, i say this with complete respect.
I don't have a favorite color.
I don't have a favorite mushroom.
- Shiitake.
- I don't know any dwarves.
And when we get back, i'm taking a monthly vow of solitude... alone.
- Fine.
I mean, that's how i like my solitude: alone.
With maybe cream.
- [Groans]
In another quarter mile, we can eat that lunch we packed.
- Oh, um... was that for both of us?
- Po!
Hold it.
Push.
- Huh?
[Gasps] croc bandits.
- Hey, there, pretty lady.
- I am a boy.
- He meant me.
- Wow, that was easy.
- Take the statue, and get the ruby.
- You'll take nothing.
Ooh!
- Yeah.
What she said.
Shakabu--
[Laughter]
- [Sighs]
- Looks like we're going to do this the hard way.
- Get off the chain.
Use--Gah!
--Leave--Ooh!
--
Other--Backhand.
- I'm stuck.
- Get it off.
Come on.
- I don't want to be a downer,
But we can't fight them like this.
- We took an oath to protect this statue.
- Capture them.
Spears!
- Uh, got a feeling we don't want to get captured here.
- I'm not changing anything.
I'm saving the statue.
We can take them.
- Good idea, but first... let's not die.
Don't be mad.
- Why would i be--
Oh, no.
[Both screaming]
- Bad idea!
Bad idea!
- No kidding!
- Try lending a hand next time.
Both: ooh!
Ooh!
- Stop doing that.
- Me?
- Ooh!
- [Sighs]
You know, up close, your face looks kind of angry.
Little lines right here and here.
- Get off!
- Ooh!
Ooh.
Oh.
Is there a way of doing this
That doesn't involve kicking me?
- Yes.
- Ooh!
Oh, i see, a new plan.
I was about to suggest--
[Screams]
- Ooh.
- Hold on.
- "Hold on"?
Let me explain handcuffs to you.
Of course.
[Both screaming]
[Birds fluttering]
- Hey, thought that would be a serious bone-Cruncher.
How about you, tigress?
Uh, tigress?
- [Muffled speech]
- [Screams]
Tigress, wake up.
Show me how to revive you!
Okay, not sure that works.
- Po, when you're chained to someone
And you jump off a cliff,
Get them to agree to it first.
That's the protocol.
- There's a protocol for that?
Who knew?
Next, you're going to tell me there's a protocol
For a three-Foot-Tall rooster
Holding a battle ax and a banana.
- Approach from the battle ax side.
The banana's a decoy.
- [Laughs] that's a good... one.
Uh, right, got it.
I'll write that down in my log.
- Oh, i can't believe we lost the statue
And the ruby.
- Oh, did we?
Ah!
Uh, i mean... did we?
- You got it?
- I grabbed it when the statue fell,
Without a plan.
Imagine that.
I guess they were too busy punching me in the face
To notice.
Losers.
- Well, when they do notice, they'll be after us.
Let's head that way.
- Ooh!
- Where's the ruby?
No, seriously--Wait.
No, no.
Where's the ru--Where's the ru--
Okay.
Okay, all right.
Funny joke, guys.
Now give me the ruby.
- Um... we don't have it.
I think i saw the panda take it.
- That's great.
No, that's great,
That you watched that happen.
That's really-- You know what?
You've got a keen eye.
I've--Did anybody ever tell you that?
That's--Next time, though?
- Yeah?
- Next time, maybe you could stop him.
Now get that ruby back!
- [Muttering]
Slow down.
This is kind of awesome, isn't it?
Po and tigress together on an adventure,
Just the way i'd always hoped it would be.
- If you count getting handcuffed, robbed,
Yanked off a cliff, and failing at the mission as awesome,
Then yes, it's been awesome.
What's next?
- We're going to get the statue back.
- Oh, well,
We can't do anything until we get these chains off.
- [Gasps] i got an idea.
- Ah!
- All right.
Pull on "three."
Ready?
- Ready.
- Three.
- I--Ooh!
--Don't--Ee!
--Think--
Ah!
--It's working.
You don't just yell "three" when you say "on three."
You actually have to count to three.
- Never heard that before.
Run!
Ow!
No, no, this way.
- Why would we run that way?
You always break toward cover.
- Of course, proper fleeing etiquette.
I must have missed that day.
Whoa!
Oof.
Do you see them?
- It's hard to tell.
- They're crocodiles.
It's like an alligator with a different snout.
- I know what they are.
- If you see any large reptiles, the code word is "pudding."
- I think we lost 'em.
- We should name our adventure.
Yeah.
You know how shifu tells the story of ugwei
And the fiery demons of wu zhong mountain?
We should have a name.
- Yeah, how about "the fiery demons of stop talking"?
- Oh, oh, oh!
We can have a song too, like:
♪ Bow chicka dow ja-Dong-Adong, beeee!
♪
♪ The furious two ♪
♪ They're going on a rampage ♪
- [Whispers] dumplings.
- Where?
[Screams]
You mean "pudding."
Ow!
What are you doing?
You said you always break towards cover.
- Unless you break towards higher ground.
- When did running away get so complicated?
[Whispers] we lost them.
Huh!
Hey, that's a nice bell.
See, this is the great thing about traveling.
You see things you'd never see at home.
- Believe it or not, po, i've seen a bell before.
- I'm getting the impression
You're not having as good a time as i am.
- Getting out of these cuffs will be my good time.
And that bell could cut the chain.
- Great.
Time to lose the jewelry.
See what i did there?
I called the cuffs "jewelry."
- Yeah, i got it.
- Uh, okay.
Uh, you're the planner,
So all the planning is covered with your plan, right?
- Right.
[Bell tolls]
- Mama.
[Bell reverberating]
- Ahhhhhhh.
[Yells] did it work?
- Shh!
Keep your voice down.
- What?
I can't hear anything!
What words am i saying?
- I think they got away.
Argh!
Darn it, guys.
We talked about this.
Remember, we gave ourselves one year to be real bandits.
We're 11 months in.
If i have to go back to carving terra-Cotta warriors
For my dad--
- I am whispering!
- That's the panda.
We're back in business.
Eat it, dad!
- What?
- Stop shouting.
- It is cloudy, but we need to get out of here!
Can you focus, please?
- Come on; they're in here.
Hit it again.
- Ooh!
- Hit it.
Hit it again.
Hit it again!
Hit it!
Hit it!
Hit it!
Hit it!
Hit it!
- What's wrong?
- Brace yourself.
- Really?
[Sniffs] you think so?
- Brace...your...self.
- Whoaaaa!
- Darn it, guys!
Oh!
- I can't think.
I haven't eaten all day.
- Really?
We ate lunch.
I ate lunch.
I ate your lunch.
Right.
Oh, ho, ho, lookee here.
I'm just gonna climb up that--
I'm just gonna--
Big belly in the way.
Don't mind if i do.
It's time for the crazy feet.
Whoa!
- Ooh!
Panda!
I can't believe you did that.
Ugh!
All i wanted was something...
to... eat.
- You're welcome.
- Thanks, po.
- Whoa, there's a lot of honey in this tree.
- Bees produce more than they eat.
- No.
Huh!
You know a lot of stuff.
- I studied...
for a long time.
- What about friends?
- My friends are the twins discipline and sacrifice.
- I don't think they'd like me.
- That's okay.
You'll never meet them.
- Ha ha!
Oh, you!
You made a funny.
- That was funny, wasn't it?
It has meaning on two levels.
You can't meet them, because they're an abstract idea,
And you won't, because you're lazy--
- Yeah, okay.
Now you're just wrecking it.
- Right.
- Um, can i ask you something?
You, uh, wanted to be the dragon warrior, didn't you?
- Everyone wanted to be the dragon warrior.
But things don't always turn out the way you think.
- You think ugwei made the wrong choice.
Okay, yeah.
Fire's getting a little low.
[Fire whooshes]
- Po!
I was carving a key to get the shackles opened.
I worked hours on that thing.
- I--I thought it was firewood.
- You didn't think at all.
You never do, dragon warrior.
- I'm just trying to--
- Do what?
Trying to do what?
Lose the statue?
Fumble through everything?
Is that the dragon warrior way?
Maybe ugwei did make the wrong choice.
- Tigress, you may be a great warrior,
But you stink at friendship
And fun...ship.
I'm out of here.
The handcuffs.
The honey must have slipped the cuff off.
Tigress, we're free!
Is there nothing honey can't do?
Po.
Po?
[Crocodiles snarling]
- Tigress, we did it.
Tigress?
Tigress!
- Look, you got a job to do.
I got a job to do.
So why don't you just tell me where the ruby is?
- Or what?
You're going to play good croc/bad croc?
- You're going down!
I'm not playing these games with you anymore!
- Forget it, gary.
She knows.
- Oh, okay.
Well, i guess i'll clean up these weapons now.
And it's gah-Ri.
- Ugh!
Crash!
If you don't want to tell us, fine.
Then we'll do this the hard way.
- You already said that.
That's twice now.
- Hey!
[Stammering]
It's--It's a good line, so shut up.
- It is a good line.
- Now, where was i?
- I think you were going to yammer on
And i was going to do this.
- [Groaning]
Darn it!
Oh, everybody back up.
Just back up.
Just back up, 'cause she's got a vicious kick.
Oh, who didn't tie her up below the knees?
Come on, guys.
This is basic stuff.
[Chuckles]
Okay.
That's it.
I'm done going easy on you.
- Let me guess; you're going to do it the hard way.
[Laughs]
Bring it, boys.
Ha ha ha.
Prepare to be torn to pieces.
Huh?
It's facing the wrong way!
Wha--Wait--No.
Roll it back out.
Turn around--
Keep preparing to be torn to pieces.
[Muttering] just hold on a second.
- They're everywhere.
I need a plan.
Ow!
- There's an intruder in the woods.
Find him!
Looks like we're doing this the hard way.
[Groaning]
Darn it!
- Po.
Po, listen, i--
- You okay?
Let's get you and the statue out of here.
- I'm surprised you came back for me.
Thanks.
- Well, it's protocol.
You know, for friends.
On three.
Three!
Ha!
- We're surrounded.
- You take half.
I'll take half.
- I'll get the statue.
- I got it.
- Po.
- Oh, right.
Sorry.
Huh!
Ha!
Clank!
- Oof!
Oof!
Welcome to the fist-Ival.
Allow me to punch your tickets.
- Can't...hold on.
- Tigress!
- Know what we need?
A plan.
We need to do this together.
[Metal clanks]
Why'd you do that?
- Because you're right.
Both: together!
- On three.
Both: three!
- How about a little flying panda style?
Ha!
[Applause]
- Nice job.
No, impressive.
But i've got the statue, and you've got the... ruby?
No, i don't think so.
I have it right here.
Look at that.
Ha ha ha!
- No!
- Darn it!
- Ha!
- Huh!
- Ha!
- [Screaming]
- Nice work.
- You too.
- Know what?
- What?
- Ugwei did make the right choice,
Dragon warrior.
- Really?
Really?
Oh, wow!
I love that you just said that.

Male announcer:
And now...
Hear The Legends Of The Kung Fu Panda
Doong, doong, doong, doong, doong-bowng, doo-boom-boom
Raised in a noodle shop
Never seeking glory or fame
He climbed a mountaintop
And earned the Dragon Warrior name
Hoo!
Ah!
Yah!
Kung Fu Panda
Doong, da-doong, doong, shu-gong, da-doong, doong
Master Shifu saw the warrior blossom and master the skills of bodacious and awesome
Kung Fu Panda
Doong, da-dngng, doong-doong, da-doong, da-da-doong
He lives, and he trains
And he fights with the furious five
Protect the valley somethin', somethin'
Somethin', somethin' alive
Ooh, ah, ooh!
Kung Fu Panda
Legends of Awesomeness
Sweet.
[Dramatically] The two legendary warriors strode bravely towards danger, cutting through the thick fog like it was...
Soup.
Dangerous, evil soup.
The two best friends had been through much that day:
An epic march, a treacherous scouting mission, the nearby shop being out of friendship bracelets, and one of the two...
Unimportant, which one...
Refusing to wear them anyway!
But they were about to face their most fearsome part yet...
Mr. Yang.
They must pay Mr. Yang, the grumpy statue cleaner, and return with their prize,
Shifu's favorite ruby-encrusted statue of Ugwei, which had grown dirty from the fearsome assault of time and dust and dried rice bits dropped on it... accidentally.
And with great pomp, the processional proceeded to progress.
Never before had such a magnificent caravan of awesomeness trekked through these hinterlands of what... of the... with...
What's the word?
- Po!
- No, that's not it.
Po, you're doing it again.
Quit daydreaming out loud.
Well, I wouldn't do it if you'd just talk to me a little.
Po, we're on a mission.
Okay.
Okay, then.
Just mission-critical stuff.
Super-important mission stuff.
Fine.
Like...
[Gasps]
What's your favorite color?
[Groans]
For me, I guess maybe blue.
Yeah, it's all steely and cold, like me.
Ooh, but I like red.
Yeah, 'cause red's all fire.
Hmm, of course there's yellow.
Yellow's all friendly, like sunshine and mustard and...
Gah, this is hard!
They're all so great.
Why can't there be one color that's so much more awesome than the other colors, it's, like, no contest?
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
It could be, like, a color you've never heard of, like grank or lipp or flugu or something.
"Hey, hey, what's your favorite color?"
"Flugu." "Wow, so's mine!"
"Hey, nice shade of flugu."
"Thanks, it's my favorite color."

Might bring a little peace to the... universe.
No?
Not a fan of the flugu?
I have a rule about idle chitchat.

If we're going to be best friends, like the way I dreamed about since I was five, you're going to have to loosen up.

How about you, Tigress?
Uh, Tigress?
[Muffled speech]

Tigress, wake up.
Show me how to revive you!
Okay, not sure that works.
Po, when you're chained to someone and you jump off a cliff, get them to agree to it first.

Now give me the ruby.
Um...
We don't have it.
I think I saw the panda take it.
That's great.
No, that's great, that you watched that happen.
That's really...

I've... did anybody ever tell you that?

Yeah?

Now get that ruby back!
[Muttering]
Slow down.
This is kind of awesome, isn't it?
Po and Tigress together on an adventure, just the way I'd always hoped it would be.
If you count getting handcuffed, robbed, yanked off a cliff, and failing at the mission as awesome, then yes, it's been awesome.
What's next?
We're going to get the statue back.
Oh, well, we can't do anything until we get these chains off.
[Gasps] I got an idea.
Ah!
All right.
Pull on "three."
Ready?
Ready.
Three.
I... ooh!

What words am I saying?
I think they got away.
Argh!
Darn it, guys.
We talked about this.
Remember, we gave ourselves one year to be real bandits.
We're 11 months in.
If I have to go back to carving terra-cotta warriors for my dad...
I am whispering!
That's the panda.
We're back in business.
Eat it, dad!
What?
Stop shouting.
It is cloudy, but we need to get out of here!
Can you focus, please?
Come on;
They're in here.
Hit it again.
Ooh!
Hit it.
Hit it again.
Hit it again!
Hit it!
Hit it!
Hit it!
Hit it!
Hit it!
What's wrong?
Brace yourself.
Really?
[Sniffs] You think so?
Brace... your... self.
Whoaaaa!
Darn it, guys!
Oh!
I can't think.
I haven't eaten all day.
Really?
We ate lunch.
I ate lunch.
I ate your lunch.
Right.
Oh, ho, ho, lookee here.
I'm just gonna climb up that...
I'm just gonna...
Big belly in the way.

Panda!
I can't believe you did that.
Ugh!
All I wanted was something...
To...
Eat.
You're welcome.
Thanks, Po.
Whoa, there's a lot of honey in this tree.
Bees produce more than they eat.
No.
Huh!
You know a lot of stuff.
I studied...
For a long time.
What about friends?
My friends are the twins discipline and sacrifice.
I don't think they'd like me.
That's okay.
You'll never meet them.
Ha ha!
Oh, you!
You made a funny.
That was funny, wasn't it?
It has meaning on two levels.
You can't meet them, because they're an abstract idea, and you won't, because you're lazy...
Yeah, okay.
Now you're just wrecking it.
Right.
Um, can I ask you something?
You, uh, wanted to be the Dragon Warrior, didn't you?
Everyone wanted to be the Dragon Warrior.
But things don't always turn out the way you think.
You think Ugwei made the wrong choice.
Okay, yeah.
Fire's getting a little low.
[Fire whooshes] Po!
I was carving a key to get the shackles opened.
I worked hours on that thing.
I...
I thought it was firewood.
You didn't think at all.
You never do, Dragon Warrior.
I'm just trying to...
Do what?
Trying to do what?
Lose the statue?
Fumble through everything?
Is that the Dragon Warrior way?
Maybe Ugwei did make the wrong choice.
Tigress, you may be a great warrior, but you stink at friendship and fun... ship.
I'm out of here.
The handcuffs.
The honey must have slipped the cuff off.
Tigress, we're free!
Is there nothing honey can't do?
Po.
Po?
[Crocodiles snarling]
Tigress, we did it.
Tigress?
Tigress!
Look, you got a job to do.
I got a job to do.
So why don't you just tell me where the ruby is?
Or what?
You're going to play good croc/bad croc?
You're going down!
I'm not playing these games with you anymore!
Forget it, Gary.
She knows.
Oh, okay.
Well, I guess I'll clean up these weapons now.
And it's Gah-ri.
Ugh!
Crash!
If you don't want to tell us, fine.
Then we'll do this the hard way.
You already said that.
That's twice now.
Hey!
[Stammering]
It's... it's a good line, so shut up.
It is a good line.
Now, where was I?
I think you were going to yammer on and I was going to do this.
[Groaning]
Darn it!
Oh, everybody back up.
Just back up.
Just back up, 'cause she's got a vicious kick.
Oh, who didn't tie her up below the knees?
Come on, guys.
This is basic stuff.
[Chuckles]
Okay.
That's it.
I'm done going easy on you.
Let me guess;
You're going to do it the hard way.
[Laughs]
Bring it, boys.
Ha ha ha.
Prepare to be torn to pieces.
Huh?
It's facing the wrong way!
Wha... wait... no.
Roll it back out.
Turn around...
Keep preparing to be torn to pieces.
[Muttering] Just hold on a second.
They're everywhere.
I need a plan.
Ow!
There's an intruder in the woods.
Find him!
Looks like we're doing this the hard way.
[Groaning]
Darn it!
Po.
Po, listen, I...
You okay?
Let's get you and the statue out of here.
I'm surprised you came back for me.
Thanks.
Well, it's protocol.
You know, for friends.
On three.
Three!
Ha!
We're surrounded.
You take half.
I'll take half.
I'll get the statue.
I got it.
Po.
Oh, right.
Sorry.
Huh!
Ha!
Clank!
Oof!
Oof!
Welcome to the fist-ival.
Allow me to punch your tickets.
Can't... hold on.
Tigress!
Know what we need?
A plan.
We need to do this together.
[Metal clanks]
Why'd you do that?
Because you're right.
Both:
Together!
On three.
Both:
Three!
How about a little flying panda style?
Ha!
[Applause]
Nice job.
No, impressive.
But I've got the statue, and you've got the... ruby?
No, I don't think so.
I have it right here.
Look at that.
Ha ha ha!
No!
Darn it!
Ha!
Huh!
Ha!
[Screaming]
Nice work.
You too.
- Know what?
- What?
Ugwei did make the right choice,
Dragon Warrior.
Really?
Really?
Oh, wow!
I love that you just said that.
Digida, digida, digida da
The furious two
Digida-duh
Dragon Warrior and his sidekick
After the rampage
Ja jagga duka ba ba
Po?
Did you say "sidekick"?
What?
No.
[Laughs] It was, like...
I mean...
So what is your favorite color?
[Sighs]
Ah, the first day of school--
The moment every parent dreams of-- freedom.
But this year turned out a little different.
Oh, do you have to go back to school?
I already miss you guys.
We miss you, too.
I love you so much.
Ohh.
I love you, mom.
- Dad.
- Son.
I wish I could go to the same school as you guys.
Us, too, Brick.
Us, too.
Mike, call me as soon as you get to work.
I will call you from the car.
Yeah, we'll call you, too, mom.
I'll call everyone from the pay phone in the school library.
Wait.
Family hug.
I know what you're thinking.
This can't possibly be my family, but it is.
So how did we get this way?
Ugh.
Where do I start?
You know how in summer, everyone takes those magical family bonding trips?
Hi!
We're back from Disney world.
Well, we took in their mail.
Here you go.
Really appreciate your hospitality, Mrs. Heck.
Here's a little something for you from us.
Souvenir magnet.
Thank you.
Love it.
Hi!
We're back from the dells.
Here's your mail.
Thanks a bunch, Frankie.
Oh.
And we got something for you, too.
Aw, and it's shaped like a little, tiny cheese.
'Cause they have cheese in Wisconsin.
That's cute.
- Greetings from the Bahamas--
- Here.
Oh, hang on.
It had a couple babies, but don't worry.
It ate 'em.
Wow.
We suck, Mike.
I ain't gonna argue.
We got any more mayo?
Seriously, look at all the great places everybody went this summer.
What did we do?
Squat.
Yeah, but with everybody else gone, we had the run of the neighborhood.
Left the garbage cans out for weeks, washed the car in my pajamas.
You can't buy that kind of experience.
You should've seen 'em, Mike--
Just so happy and close and sun-kissed.
What about us?
We barely even saw our kids.
I know.
Kind of a perfect summer, wasn't it?
No, but shouldn't we wanna see 'em?
I mean, isn't it our obligation to make memories for them, you know, while there's still time?
I mean, think about it.
Sue's starting high school.
Axl's gonna be a junior.
A few more years, the kids will be gone.
Don't jinx it.
No, I'm serious, Mike.
Before long, we're gonna be living in an empty house.
Keep talking like that, I just might put this sandwich down and pick you up.
Okay, fine.
Joke all you want, but name three times that you've seen the kids since may.
And not just in the house.
I'll even count around town.
The more Mike thought about it, the more he realized
I was right.
Thanks to his lifeguard job, the only evidence of Axl even existing in our house anymore was a pile of wet towels and dirty clothes.
Red bull.
A hint of BO.
I think he was here Wednesday.
Nope, he was way too busy enjoying his newfound superpower.
You!
In the yellow 2-piece.
Over here.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Your shoulders are getting red.
You're gonna have to stay in the shade next to me.
Right here.
Come.
Purple top, green bottom, bring it over.
I saw you had a popsicle before you went in.
You know the rule about eating and swimming.
I'm gonna need your number so I can call you later to make sure that you're okay.
There you go.
And, uh, also send your friend over.
She looks like she was about to run.
Meanwhile, Brick was enjoying a few joys of summer of his own.
Shh!
And Sue spent her summer with carly, camped out at the mall.
Oh, my God.
That cute boy at hot dog America is totally looking over here.
Really?
Wait.
Don't look.
Okay, now look.
Wait, don't!
Okay, now.
Aah!
He saw us looking.
Which do you like better, yellow mustard or brown mustard?
- Which do you like better?
- I asked you first.
I know what one I like.
Okay, on three.
One, two...
- Brown.
- Yellow!
Okay, Mike.
You might not have missed the kids, but I have, and I don't want the only magnet we have to show for ourselves to be from Orson gutter and septic.
Well, in case you didn't notice, those magnets are holding up our unpaid bills.
Well, we'll just have to be creative, then.
Come on.
Think.
Just something quick and cheap that we can look back on when we're old and alone and say, "hey, remember that thing we did with those kids we used to have?"
Well, you want quick and cheap, I got quick and cheap for ya.
Oh, no.
- Don't say it.
- I'm gonna say it.
- No, don't say it.
- I'm saying it.
Camping.
There.
I said it.
- Really?
- Yep.
Camping.
You really gonna go there?
You-- think carefully.
I said it, didn't I?
Mike, the last time I went camping with you was literally the worst night of my life.
The worst.
- Worst.
- Come on.
Our honeymoon was 19 years ago.
Yeah, and you know exactly how horrible it was.
Wasn't that bad.
It practically killed our marriage out of the gate.
And I swore after that night,
I would never go back in the woods with you again.
Hey, you want a vacation or not?
You know what?
I think this was your plan all along.
Yeah, this was my master plan--
Stay poor for 19 years so we can go camping again.
So after five hours driving around town hunting down all our kids, we finally had 'em all in one place to break the good news.
Now... we know your friends all had fun this summer going on these great family vacations, and you were thinking, "gee, we didn't do anything."
And me and dad wanted to spend some time with you before school starts, so...
Guess what?
We're gonna take a little family vacation of our own.
No!
What?
!
It's my last weekend as a lifeguard.
After this, all the chicks cover up and get fat for the winter.
The librarian was gonna let me re-shelve etruscan literature.
They don't let civilians do that.
But I start high school on Monday.
High school!
And I'm not remotely ready.
I haven't even finished decorating my binder.
Please, please, don't make me go!
You can't do this!
You can't just spring a vacation on us.
Jeez, you don't even know what we're doing.
What are we doing?
We're going camping.
No!
Yeah.
It was your dad's idea.
Dad!
- Why are you punishing us?
- What did we do?
!
Hey, I was perfectly happy not seeing you kids all summer.
- This is your mom's thing.
- Mom!
Can't we at least do something inside that has a tv and isn't gross?
Look, any motel we can afford is gonna have more bugs than the woods.
Just get on board with camping.
Guys, camping was not my first choice either by a long shot.
But here's an idea.
Maybe we just don't use that word.
Let's not think of it as camping.
Let's think of it as outdoor family fun.
But we don't wanna go.
Fine.
Forced family fun.
You're dragging us into the woods against our will.
That's kidnapping.
Mm, if we were gonna kidnap some kids, you'd be far down the list.
It's just for two days.
Hey, wanna go for three?
So with lowered expectations and a vague sense of dread, we packed up the station wagon and hit the road.
And this time, I'm proud to say I finally remembered to bring the blue snack bag...
All the way to the car.
You forgot the blue bag?
!
You think I'm happy about this?
I had wine coolers and a frozen snickers in there.
Hey, you see that poplar grove over there?
That is one of the oldest in the state of Indiana.
It says here the tulip poplar, or liriodendron tulipfera, grows to 70 feet and has beautiful flowers.
I know.
I just saw a bunch of 'em right over there.
Axl, I need to know.
In high school, what do people do in study hall and how do you work the combination lock and where do people eat lunch and can I still eat goldfish or is that considered a kid snack and should I try to find a snack that is more mature?
Shh!
I'm sleeping.
I need to know this stuff, Axl.
I'm starting high school, and I don't want to look like a dork!
Wait.
What's this?
It's a message from that ship.
Darn it.
It already sailed.
Mom!
Did you hear that?
Did you hear what he just said?
I could say I did, but honestly,
I wasn't listening.
Mike, I'm smelling something really rank.
Do you smell that?
Fine, Axl.
Who needs you anyway?
I'm sure everything I need to know is in my freshman handbook.
Oh, no!
I forgot my freshman handbook!
Dad, we have to turn around right now!
We have to go back!
There's an idea I can get behind.
Why don't you get behind the idea of not being a smartass?
Are you talking to me?
That's for the whole backseat.
According to my book, we should be passing by a log cabin that Abraham Lincoln spent the night at during his run for presidency.
Then let's keep our eyes peeled.
That's okay.
They have a picture.
Axl, we need to talk about the cafeteria.
In high school, do we call it the "caf"?
Because when Hannah Montana went to high school,
- they called it the "caf."
- Sue, keep talking, but just remember, if I threw you out of the car right now,
I'd be tried as a juvenile.
Is there one lunch period that's cooler than the other?
Whatever one you're not in.
Which one are you in?
Aah!
Why are you asking me that?
!
Why is she asking me that?
!
Because we're going to the same school, and I might need to go up to your table at lunch and ask you something!
- Okay!
- Aah!
That's it!
If you are insisting on going to school with me, we are setting some ground rules right now!
No looking at me, no talking to me, no acknowledging me in any way.
If an emergency happens, like mom or dad dies or something, you can relay the message to Sean, and he will let me know, and I will see you at the funeral.
- Have I made myself clear?
- But what if I--
Or if I--
But what if there's an emergency
- and someone puts a bomb in my backpack and I might need...
- Hey!
Okay, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it!
How about we all sing a fun family traveling song?
# 99 bottles of beer on the wall # # 99 bottles of beer # # take one down, pass it around, 98-- #
Really?
You're all just so busy?
Ugh.
Now I'm starting to smell something, too.
Yeah.
I'm getting it now.
- Axl's not wearing shoes.
- Oh!
- What?
- Gross, Axl!
- Axl, put your shoes on.
- Can't.
I forgot 'em.
- What?
!
- Are you kidding?
You forgot shoes?
How does a person forget shoes?
How does a person forget a snack bag?
I guess the shoes I'm not wearing are now on the other foot.
Well, we can't stop to get you any, genius.
We're in the middle of nowhere.
Relax!
I don't need 'em.
I've been barefoot all summer.
My feet are practically shoes now anyway.
Check out these leathery dogs.
Ohh!
Ohh!
- Axl!
Come on.
- Ohh!
Oh, my God!
You can't handle this, what are you taking us camping for?
It'll be like going on vacation on the bottom of my foot.
Hey, I don't wanna hear any more complaints about camping.
- Camping is gonna be great.
- Pfft.
Okay, you can't judge camping from our honeymoon, Frankie.
This is a whole new thing.
You went camping on your honeymoon?
Dad, did you really take mom camping?
Oh!
Is that why she never talks about it?
It was a perfectly valid honeymoon choice, and, by the way, she was on board with it in the beginning.
Oh.
So are you gonna tell me where you're taking me on our honeymoon?
Oh, now that's a surprise, Mrs. Heck.
"Mrs. Heck."
I'm Mrs. Heck.
I'm a wife.
Whoa.
I'm a wife.
And someday I'm gonna be a mom, and you're gonna be a dad, and our kids will be in the backseat.
That'll be fun, don't you think--
Us driving around with our two kids?
We are gonna have awesome kids!
Oh, so... where are you gonna take me?
You want me to blow the surprise?
I really do.
Well, Mrs. Heck, I am taking you camping.
Oh, wow!
- Camping.
- You're disappointed.
No!
No.
Are you kidding?
Look, in 10 or 20 years from now, when we got tons of money, we're gonna be able to go on vacation anywhere we want, but you are gonna love this.
Trust me.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Oh, it's the greatest thing in the world--
The stars, the quiet.
And you're gonna like me camping.
I got some camping moves.
Ohh!
Get your stinking feet out of my face!
They're not touching you!
They're not touching you!
They're not touching you!
Ew!
Ugh!
So was it?
What, Brick?
Was what what?
Your honeymoon-- Was it romantic?
Did you guys have fun?
- Sure.
- Sure.
Okay, guys.
This is the good stuff from before government regulations, so shut your eyes.
Go on through.
Aah!
It burns my throat!
Oh!
Did I not say to shut your head holes?
All right, come on back through for the sunscreen.
Ow.
Ow, ow.
Way to go, mom and dad!
Thanks for bringing us to the jaggedy-est campsite ever.
What is that?
What?
You said to get water.
From the vending machine, Axl.
Why do you think I gave you 2 bucks?
Well, I thought you were paying me, but now I see I'm just your slave.
Yes, master.
Ow, ow, ow.
- Ow, ow, ow.
- Wait, Axl, before you go, there's not some special high school ruled paper, is there?
'Cause I know there's college ruled, but I didn't see any high school ruled.
Is there high school ruled?
Here's the thing.
They don't really care that much about paper, but for some reason, they are crazy strict about erasers.
They are?
Yeah.
There's this really specific one they want you to have.
It's pink on one side, gray on the other, and they're really obsessed about it.
This one kid last year tried to use the wrong eraser, and...
Got expelled.
Really?
Uh-huh.
Now he lives in an abandoned sewer pipe, and for dinner, all he eats is...
Sue's an idiot.
Oh, ha ha, Axl.
You are hilariously funny.
So do I need a special eraser or not?
!
Come on, Brick.
Book down.
We're hitting the lake.
No.
No finger.
Come on.
Let's go.
How long will this take?
I don't know, Brick.
It's really up to the fish.
Why do I have to go?
Because we're camping.
It's a beautiful day, and I said so.
Was it a beautiful day on your bad honeymoon?
Bad?
No one said it was bad.
Rain's kinda romantic, isn't it?
Uh-huh!
Might want to put down that metal pole.
You can get electrocuted pretty bad.
Oh, so it rained on your honeymoon?
So that's why it was so bad?
Yeah, bad, rainy honeymoon.
That's it.
Anyway--
Mom.
Jeez!
What are you, a cop or something?
I said that's it.
I actually wanted to talk to you about something else.
You may not be aware, because I've been playing it pretty cool, but I'm sort of nervous about starting high school.
Oh, honey.
Everybody's nervous.
But you have carly, so--
But that's just it.
See, carly got this boyfriend, so she's going into high school practically an adult, and the only adult experience I have was the time
I filled out the "Cosmo" sex quiz.
I didn't know any of the answers.
I didn't even understand the questions.
I just filled in all B's and C's.
It's okay.
Look, I know you may feel worried, but I'm not worried about you.
I think you're gonna do great in high school.
Really?
How great?
I think... you will do as great as you always do.
But I just get the feeling it's gonna be a lot different.
I mean, high school kids are a lot more mature.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Ow!
Bleeding.
Definitely bleeding.
Ow.
Ow, ow.
Pretty great, huh?
You get why-
- Oh, for the love of God, are you reading again?
I thought we left the book back at the campsite.
Brick, we're not here to read.
We're here to spend time together and enjoy the lake.
Oh, you wanna know about the lake.
It says the lake is 200 feet at its deepest point and fed by eight streams.
Really?
What color is it?
Print's a little fuzzy.
Maybe...
Gray or...
Oh.
Actually, it's more blue.
Hmm.
And silvery.
They should really take a better picture of that and put it in a book so people can enjoy it.
Brick, you just did enjoy it, and you know why?
'Cause you looked at it.
You gotta look at the lake and the trees and the whole deal, or you're missing out.
Yeah.
I think I'm just more of a book person.
I don't know what to tell you then.
Think of the trees as pre-books.
Look, Brick, you know all the people that wrote these books you read?
Authors.
Yeah, I know what they're called, Brick.
Point is, they had to actually do something to have something to write about, to-- to experience stuff around 'em.
Nobody wrote a book about reading a book.
Actually, they did.
"The Neverending Story,"
which was first published in German under the title "Die Unendliche Geschichte."
Geschichte.
Here.
Now what?
Well...
Now nothing.
Now we sit and we wait.
That's the beauty of it.
Lot of people don't understand the beauty of quiet--
Lot of people right in our house.
It's a lot like standing in line at the grocery store, only holding a stick.
Yeah, I guess it is.
Huh.
Yep.
Whoa!
What is happening?
What is that?
M-my pole is all bendy.
You got one!
- Really?
!
I did?
!
- Mm-hmm.
- I read about this!
- Yeah.
Reel it in.
No, no, no.
The other way.
Okay, yeah.
Th-that's fine.
Give a little slack, or you'll lose him.
There you go.
You got it!
Here you go.
Yes!
Come here!
You got him!
Nice going!
Wow!
A fish!
Is this how fish sticks start out?
Well, not the ones we can afford.
Hey, hey.
Guess who caught his first fish.
Wow, Brick!
Good goin'!
Yep.
Brick kept an open mind, and now he really gets camping.
Don't you, buddy?
I caught two, and dad caught six, and then we both peed in the bushes.
Hey, can we invite the people in the winnebago with the tv to have dinner with us?
No, Brick, this is just for us.
Oh, sure.
So now you wanna keep it to just us.
Hmm.
Well...
The ground's still kinda wet, but our honeymoon suite is all set.
Ready to carry me over the flap?
Oh, I've been ready all day.
What's that?
I don't know.
Hey!
Hello?
Who's there?
Hello?
Anybody?
Hey.
I know you.
Do I know you?
Mike.
Mike Heck.
It's me, Nicky Kohlbrenner.
Class of '83.
Manager of the basketball team.
Hey... wow.
Nicky.
Hey, pal.
Well, here, I'm gonna put you down now.
Been forever.
I mean, what are the odds?
And who is this lovely lady?
This is Frankie, my wife.
You're married.
Good for you.
Good for you.
Mikey, what ever happened to that--
That smoking hot chick you dated senior year?
What was her name?
Uh, Darcy...
Stacy...
Tracy.
Right!
Tracy.
Man, you were really in love with her.
I thought for sure you two were gonna get married.
Yeah, he was just gaga over her.
Remember the time you snuck her onto the team bus?
Oh, man!
Get a room.
Yeah, well, Nicky, turns out this is the gal for me.
So... how long you two been hitched?
Oh... about four hours.
Oh, my God.
This is your honeymoon?
Am I crashing your honeymoon?
Well... sorta, kinda.
Well, why didn't you say so?
Oh, jeez.
Where are my manners?
I got some wine right here for a toast.
What are the odds?
Go ahead.
Oh, no, that's okay.
I'm not really a wine... sipper.
Take it.
It's my gift to you.
Oh, that's...
Mmm.
Wow.
It's nice.
Yeah.
That's from Kohlbrenner vineyards,
IE, my bathtub.
Well, it's great to see ya.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You, too.
Ohh.
Oh, boy.
Ohh.
Boy, that's feels good.
Could I trouble you for the day?
Uh, Saturday.
Wow.
I've been walking for two days.
I guess it's time to admit I'm lost.
By the way, you look really familiar.
Have we met before?
Oh, no.
I'm pretty sure I would have remembered you.
Well, kudos for landing the power forward of the Orson thundering hens municipal champs.
And you were the manager, you said?
Ah, that's all right, Mikey.
I don't expect you to remember me.
You were the big star.
I just took care of the equipment.
Ah.
Not like I ever played.
Well... there was that one time the coach told me to suit up last game of senior year.
Oh, yeah?
Four minutes on the clock.
You take the charge from the big power forward, and bam!
You hit the floor.
You're not getting up.
And then, coach Benson turned, and he pointed to me.
And then I got up off the bench, finally.
And then I heard the crowd starting to cheer, and wow, you got up, Mikey.
Who woulda guessed you'd stand up from an injury like that?
Not me, but you did.
So back down on the bench I went.
My dad was in the stands.
I remember, 'cause he picked his camera up like this and then...
Back down like this.
He died that year, but it's not like I didn't go on to success.
I mean, I didn't go on to success, but it's okay.
My lack of success means I don't meet a lot of women, but I like the solitude.
Or you grow to like it anyway.
Funny thing is, you didn't even play that well.
You just...
limped around.
You didn't score one point that whole last quarter.
Oh, well.
Why don't you stay for dinner?
So what happened?
Did he turn out to be one of those escaped convicts with a hook for a hand?
I wish.
Frankie.
Aah!
I'm telling mom!
Mom!
What the hell's going on?
Axl chip-clipped my eye!
Axl!
It really hurts!
But I left it on so you could see what he did to me.
It's her fault!
I was aiming for her mouth, but she moved!
Axl!
What were you thinking?
!
You could really have hurt your sister, and now the chips are gonna get stale!
She won't shut up about high school.
She's driving me nuts!
I mean, you have to agree, she's a huge dork!
What's on your feet?
They're my dope new kicks.
Check 'em out.
Just tell me you took the cereal out first.
No, I'm a moron who tied full cereal boxes to his feet.
Okay, Axl, no more hurting your sister, and, Sue, no more talking about high school.
We came here to have family fun, and that's what we're gonna do!
So you're finally gonna let us go over to the winnebago and watch tv?
No, we're playing a board game that I brought.
Ugh!
Even in the woods, we're the poorest people!
Uh, mom, I don't remember there being a spinner in Monopoly.
Way to go, mom.
There's no dice.
And no properties.
Only some "Sorry!" cards.
That's okay.
We can make this work.
Look, look, look, we each get some money to start.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, except for Mike, who gets 2 scrabble tiles, each worth $100.
Hmm.
- I get the thimble!
- I get the battleship.
Hey, the only thing left in here is a dirty sock.
Okay, so Brick's the dirty sock, and your dad and I will just keep track of where we're going with our fingers.
See?
This is gonna work out great.
I'm first.
Community chest!
There's no cards.
Okay, well, um...
Pop this bubble, and if you get a 2 or a 6, you get another turn.
Oh!
5.
Too bad.
Brick, you're up.
Brick.
Oh, me?
I thought you said "Rick."
Three, four, five...
This chunk of the board's missing.
That's okay.
You can either, uh, buy a hungry hippo to swim across the gap or trade in Professor Plum for a bonus spin.
How much for the hippo?
Frankie, this game makes no sense.
I'm trying to make a special vacation here, Mike.
Just spin.
Oh, my God.
I thought of a really important question about high school that really needs to be answered.
See?
She won't shut up!
Hence the chip clip.
"Reading Railroad."
Uh... we don't have that one.
Oh, well, you can have Peppermint Forest or Queen Frostine, or you pick one of these activity cards.
Ah.
"Do a charade." No.
Oh, come on!
That would be fun.
We'll never know.
Please, Axl, it's really important.
Sue, I told you we're not talking about that right now.
We're trying to create some special family memories, okay?
Axl, spin.
Come on, "bankrupt,"
so I don't have to play this lame game anymore.
Uh...
Ooh!
Landed on water works.
Gonna king myself for that.
That's not how it works.
You could only king yourself if you connect four.
Axl, please, you have to tell me!
Do we say the pledge of allegiance before or after the morning announcements?
Sue!
What?
!
I'm not asking as a student.
I am asking as an American.
Oh... my...
God.
Seriously, mom, you cannot send her to my school!
All right, since Axl's being mean to his sister, he loses a turn.
G-17.
Reverse bingo to you, Brick.
Oh, so she's a complete freak show, and then when I call her on it, I'm the mean one?
!
Stop yelling.
People come to the woods for quiet.
Look, I'll give you three fonzie "cool" points if you stop fighting.
Brick, it's your turn.
Brick!
Brick?
Huh?
Oh, I don't know the rules of the game.
Nobody knows the rules of the game.
Just spin or pop or whatever and move your sock.
Brick.
He's reading a book.
Just because Sue is being a freak show, you don't have to take your anger out on me.
I am not a freak show.
I am just asking questions that any incoming freshman would want to know.
And I still don't think I got a clear answer on that pledge of allegiance thing.
Brick, what did I say to you out by the lake?
Well, first you said, "pretty great, huh?
"For the love of God, you're reading again.
I thought we left the book back at the campsite,"
- and then I said--
- I don't need the minutes.
What was the point I was making?
If you don't know, how am I supposed to?
Kabam!
I just sunk your yahtzee.
Brick, what did I tell you about not burying your head in a book?
I looked at the lake.
It's not just about looking at the lake one time, Brick.
The lake is a symbol.
It's about...
Participating in life, being part of the family, noticing what's around you.
There are amazing stars up there if you ever looked at 'em.
I thought you got that.
Oh.
Apparently not.
All right, you know what?
Fine.
You wanna read?
Go to your tent.
Okay.
Yeah, great punishment, Mike.
You're sending him to a more comfortable place to do what he's already been doing.
Sue, it's your turn.
Here.
I'll read the card for you.
Do not pass go.
Go right to loser gardens where you already own all the properties.
Hmm.
The player to your left is a smelly footed stupid head.
Player to your right has no witty comebacks!
The player to your left has an ugly face!
The player to your right should already know what an ugly face is 'cause she looks at one every day in the mirror!
Ohh!
I'd like to solve the murder.
Sue got killed in the woods with the ax!
Ugh!
Take this, you--
Stop it, you two!
You're ruining battle Boggleopoly!
- Aah!
- That's it!
Sue, Axl, go to your tent!
What?
But she's the one who did the--
Axl, stop it.
I don't wanna hear it.
You've been a jerk to your sister this whole vacation, and you are her big brother!
You're supposed to help her!
Why?
Why do I always have to help her?
Why do I always have to be the one to save the day?
What?
!
When did you ever save the day?
Seriously, name one day you saved.
No, not even a day.
Name a morning you saved.
You know, she's scared, Axl.
She's scared?
I'm scared!
Ever think about that?
Everyone's always worried about Sue, but what about me?
I spent years building my reputation at school, and now she's coming into my world, and...
Sue-ing it up!
It's not fair!
But no one cares about what I might be going through.
Nobody even thinks about me!
Ugh!
Ugh!
See?
This is why I didn't wanna go camping.
It does not bring people closer together.
It brings them farther apart.
Will you stop blaming everything on camping?
You had one bad time.
It was really bad.
Okay, yes, and it's all my fault.
It was, Mike.
It was.
So then the ball's coming right at you, but there's not even enough time to raise your hands, so you bump the ball off your head into the air--
Whoosh!
Right into the bucket to beat the buzzer.
What are the odds?
I forgot all about that.
That was a great game.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ugh!
We make a good team.
You hit the shot.
I wiped your sweat up off the floor.
Hey, I never slipped once.
Oh, and then remember you told Tracy that you were too woozy to drive home, 'cause you hit the ball on your head, so you had to go home with her.
Ah, you dog.
Okay.
Mrs. dog-
- Right here.
Uh-oh.
You're upset.
Mike, I made your new wife upset.
I'm not upset.
Here.
Let me make you...
An "I'm sorry" s'more.
The secret is to shimmy the marshmallow off the stick.
Shimmy.
Don't yank.
Shimmy.
- No.
- Taste the difference that the shimmy makes.
Thanks, but--
- You gotta try it.
It's good.
- No, I--
Mmm.
Yeah.
That's tasty.
But I'm still kinda full from all the cake.
From our wedding...
Earlier today.
Oh.
Hey, I get it.
Message received.
You don't gotta tell me twice.
If there's one thing you can say about Nicky Kohlbrenner, he knows when he's not wanted.
He knows it a lot.
Okay.
There was an order I packed it so it all fit.
Hey, pal, why don't you let me help you here?
Look at that.
- That'll go there.
- All set.
- Oh, look at that.
It all fits.
- Oh, beautiful.
Look at that.
Okay.
Very good, very good.
- Bring it up.
Put it on his back.
- Here we go.
There's no chance you're ever looking up Tracy again, right?
You mind if I take a crack at that?
Hey, knock yourself out.
Well, bye now.
Right when I was about to leave.
What are the odds?
Why don't you stay until the rain stops?
Whoo.
Wow.
I guess I had to get lost to find a true friend.
Oh, these scented candles are nice.
Seriously, Mike?
What?
Frankie, what am I supposed to do?
You think I'm happy about this?
I don't know.
Maybe you are.
We've only been married one day.
I don't know you that well.
Maybe you're the kind of guy who hangs out with his buddies all the time and ignores his wife!
You may have just shown me a side of you
I don't know if I like.
Well, I thought you were sweet and caring, but I guess you're the kind of girl that sends a lost guy out into the rain!
Maybe you just showed me a side of you that I don't know if I'd like.
Are these chocolates for everybody?
Great.
Neither of us likes each other, and now we're having our first fight!
It's not bad enough that we're camping on our honeymoon, and now we're fighting.
You were excited about camping!
I said, "oh, wow."
That's not excited!
That's lying!
You don't know me at all!
You know, the guy did say, "for better or worse."
Well, I didn't know you'd be leading with worse!
Okay!
I screwed up.
I took you camping on our honeymoon, which is apparently the worst idea ever.
It rained, and an annoying guy from my high school showed up, and we had a fight.
But it was 19 years ago, Frankie. 19 years!
We got three kids!
It worked out!
Why won't you let this go?
Because...
I can't.
Okay, fine, then sulk.
Sulk just like you did then.
I didn't sulk!
Yes, you did.
You sulked all night, and you couldn't let it go.
I tried to make up with you!
- What?
- That's right.
In the tent.
I tried to make up with you!
Mike?
Mike, the rain stopped.
He's gone.
Aw.
I'm sorry, Mike.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Ohh.
Aah!
Aah!
I'm kidding.
I knew it was you.
You're not Mike!
Oh, you and everybody else.
It's like I'm talking to my father all over again.
Get out!
Get out, get out, get out, get out!
Okay.
We're in a tent here.
It's just us.
Get out!
You know, in an alternate universe, you and I could have been very happy together.
Get out.
Ugh!
What?
That's right, Mike.
I almost consummated our marriage with Nicky Kohlbrenner!
What?
!
I thought it was you!
How could you think it was me?
Why would I think it wasn't you?
There was one man in the tent.
I assumed it was my new husband, you know, seeing as it was our honeymoon and all!
I went for a walk.
Who goes for a walk on their honeymoon?
!
We had been fighting!
I wasn't used to it like I am now!
If I'd have known that you'd jump on any tall guy in a sleeping bag,
I wouldn't have.
Oh, jeez, there's a man sleeping next to me on my wedding night that's not my husband?
!
What are the odds?
I'll tell you what the odds are, Mike. 1 in 2.
What are you yelling at me for?
You're the one that kissed the guy.
You know how many people I kissed since we got married?
You!
I think I deserve a freebie.
Fine!
Be my guest!
Got anyone in mind?
Oh, I got a few in mind.
Maybe some that you might not expect.
You got nothin'.
Oh, but you know what it is, Frankie?
19 years later, and we're still having the same argument, and you know why?
Because you don't know how to go with the flow.
And until you learn how to go with the flow, you'll never get camping!
I was trying to create some memories!
Well, you got 'em!
So everyone went to bed mad.
In the race for suckiest night of my life, tonight was officially neck and neck with my honeymoon.
- Ow.
- Mom?
You're on my hand.
Oh, sorry.
Mom, guess what?
I've matured.
Yeah, Sue, you're going to high school.
We get it.
No, I mean, I was just in the bathroom, and I found out...
I've matured.
Wait.
You mean...
Yes!
Can you believe it?
I've been lying about having it for a year and a half, and it finally happened!
Oh, wow!
I know.
Okay, okay, okay.
Um, do you need a--
No.
I've been carrying them around in my purse for years.
Isn't it exciting?
Yeah, well, it's not always gonna be as fun as it seems tonight, but...
The funny thing is, when I thought about telling carly on Monday, it hit me that we might not be in the same homeroom anymore, which usually would make me worry.
But then I realized, all that stuff that scared me about high school was just sort of... gone.
- Oh, Sue!
- Yeah.
Just don't tell dad or Axl.
Of course.
It'll be just between us girls.
I mean, us women.
Oh, shh!
We're gonna wake dad.
Doesn't sound like dad.
Then I remembered ignoring something
Brick read to us in the car.
"Bears are most active around dawn and dusk.
"They're often attracted to improperly packed food,
"but some studies suggest they may also be drawn to menstruating women."
Wake up!
- Wake up!
- Frankie, what's going on?
Sue's got her period, and there's a bear outside!
- Mom!
- Oh!
What's with the screaming?
- There's a bear, and Sue got her period!
- What?
Run.
Run.
Everybody get to the car.
Bear!
Bear!
My daughter's got her period!
Everybody run!
Run away!
Really, Sue?
Now?
!
I couldn't help it.
It's a girl with her period!
There have been studies!
Make way!
Mom, you said you weren't gonna tell!
Oh!
Wait.
Where's Brick?
Brick!
I don't know.
He said something earlier
- about going to look at the stars.
- Oh, God.
He's out there by himself, and it's my fault.
Why did I tell him not to read?
Oh, no.
He's so little.
He's gonna be like an appetizer!
I gotta go find him.
I'm right here.
Oh, Brick!
Oh, you scared us!
We thought you were out there looking at stars.
I was.
Jeez, Brick, you still don't get it, do ya?
- I thought I explained--
- Mike, not the time!
Oh, damn it.
The battery's dead.
Sorry, I was using the light to read.
I think it wants Sue!
Just give her to the bear and let him marry her!
It's not like she's gonna do any better!
Oh!
We're all gonna die!
All right, everyone quiet!
I'll handle this.
Hey!
"Hey"?
That won't even get the Glossners off our front lawn!
Oh, God!
Okay, everyone just hold on!
I read bears don't like loud noises!
We should all shout or sing!
# 99 bottles of beer on the wall # # 99 bottles of beer # # 99 bottles of beer # # take one down, pass it around #
# 98 bottles of beer on the wall # # 98 bottles of beer on the wall #
Around 86 bottles of beer on the wall, the bear went away.
Turns out nobody likes that song.
Yep, there's a lot of different things you can bring back from a summer vacation--
A magnet, a t-shirt, a picture with all your heads through a funny cut-out.
But once in a while, you bring home something a lot more meaningful.
Like I said, Mrs. Heck, camping.
I get it now.
I wonder how long it'll last.
Oh, Axl, one more question.
Are the water fountains twist or push, because--
Hey!
I'll drive her.
Hey!
The film you're about to see, is based on real events ...
Although there have been numerous documented cases ...
In which users occurrences experienced ... inexplicable and strange, while used a Ouija Board ...
Scientists take them As ...
Matches.
- This is on?
- Yes it is.
- Are you serious?
- Please, do not move much.
- How do you use this?
- You are very beginner, right?
I do not know how to operate a camera, only be in front of a camera.
That's why you pay these days, right?
- Not even paid me!
- That's why I'm kidding!
Look ...
Even would know this, without me.
Not even know it.
But anyway ...
I have to make myself introduction, so enf?

Or what happens here, I do not know either, apart from the fact that We're about to do magic.
Tell us, give us some what is happening here.

- Come to the home of Michael.
That is the friend of my handsome boyfriend Kevin.
Great, I'll put this.

- They look like much.
OK honey.
Yes, Calvin is there.
Okay, quick follow me.

Calvin, big black guy, I will love, you will be facing the camera.
Believed to be a star, Michael, like ...
Of Course.
- Michael!
Brandon arrived!

Michael is cute too.
Oh, how they are, I'm Calvin, man.
The of $ 100,000 yes!
Hey ...
And this is my beautiful Roxanne.
I'm just playing.
Already back baby.
Just leave me without say, I'm sorry.
If I can put this table here and download it, sorry.
- Come on!
Come on!
- Well, then we're all here.
Can anyone tell us exactly why?
I can ...
By the way, I love do it, but first of all ...
That has to go, no I can have the camera ...
No ...
Turn it off please.
- Thanks Calvin.
- Turn it off.
- Relax honey.
- Thank You.
Oh look, the camera it's in my face again.
I just need 30 seconds, is all I ask.
- Something interesting please.
- 30 seconds.
Come on.
Shay's out there ...
We're both nyfa.
What is nyfa?
The Academy's Film Festival New York.
- Filmes Academy?
- Yup.
Are not we in Dallas?
Do not do that logistics is something so interesting.
I do not know what that means.
With the camera here, what I want to do ...
Do not think it will help, I certainly do not think it works ...
What else will not work?
I need something specific.
Be yes, but ...
Just give me this, you can not fail.
I make a deal, if you shut up, I'll tell you something.
- Is it a deal?
- It's a deal.
- Great ...
- What we do, the truth is ...
Let's get the Ouija.
- Oh my God!
Is it serious?
- I know, I know!
- So Perfect!
- I'm excited too, but ...
That's why we do not want the camera here, I mean ...
If a ghost appears, will not do with a camera.
Have you ever seen a good photo or video of a ghost?
- Twilight.
- It's a movie and are vampires.
So even, you're in the same place.
I need you to court.
Can you just give me something, while we are out there?
Well, I'll give you this, have to go there and ...
There are a couple of rules, I have to retouch.
I'll let you shoot it.
Once we begin playing with Table ...
No more shooting.
It sounds good?
- It works, thanks.
- You are quite welcome.
Focus ...
Well ...
Lights, great, very exciting is about to happen.
I will learn will happen here tonight.
We know that there will be Ouija Board involved.
So there will be a very terrifying things.
Things ghost.
Who knows what will happen here tonight.
I do not know, unless to stay with us.
You know, you really are a person of bounds,
I gave some time with the camera ...
- And now you want interviews.
- Michael has always been there.
You know, is the best friend of Calvin.
Calvin!
My friend, of course, I've known him forever.
By the way, since I moved here, Calvin was ... one of the first I met when I arrived.
I do not know ...
Even I like well, is foolish.
- Calvin and I went to a club.
- We met at a club.
- Yes Y ...
- And it's Lounge.
- Yeah ...
And she ...
- It was one month ago.
Yes Y ...
And both were flirting with a girl.
And ...
I went to the bar for a drink, and is where I met Shay.
And ...
We talked for a minute and I was about to buy a drink ...
Then came my friend Calvin.
He had a red dress, I was glued to his body.
- And you were very sexy, baby.
- He wore the red dress.
And ... you.
Know, he was there ...
So he and Shay, began to speak.
- And ...
That's what that is.
- Oh yes, if you remember when you speak ...?
And I said, you had a dream, on we were on a beach.
He's the most ...
ridiculous, and as it is ... a woman can sit there and believe ...
- ...
What comes out of his mouth.
- Okay.
I was thinking about that night ...
What color you were using?
- Blue!
Strapples.
- Yes, yes, that is.
Strapless blue dress, That's wonderful!
She is financial bride.
You are using the watch.
Yay!
Oh yeah!
She me buy this watch.
It's beautiful.
- Look.
- A Rolex.
You know you have a beautiful girlfriend.
A bride sex, a beautiful girlfriend.
A bride "I have a new car" Girlfriend "take me down the street."
Do it again.
How much you want to bet that when I turn, made this face?
- What's that over there?
- Say What?
- She is ...
Poor ...
You're blind.
- That's it?
We Broke Up?
- For Sure.
- Great.
Thank You.
I know you are excited to know, why gathered here tonight.
- Yes please!
- So here it is.
- Drum pattern please.
- You have them.
- Grab that for me.
- Yup.
And one of these.
Oh no!
- Hey, hey!
You do not know it!
- I'm not crazy, I can watch it.
It's a Ouija Board.
But do not you ever I felt the least bit curious?
Do Not!
- Not even a little bit?
- Do Not!
Okay, well, I do well I'm very excited.
- Do you know why not thrill me?
- How come?
Because my grandmother, cryo not a fool.
Okay ... but no it is your dead grandmother?
Yes probably a Ouija Board.
- No way, do you want the salute?
- Do Not.
- I'm excited.
- Thanks Shay!
Shay is thrilled.
Did you just laugh?
Now, first of all, I want to make ... that this is good right?
- Are you in?
- I'm here.
- Shay?
- I'm in!
- Thank You ...
- Calvin, with cell overnight.
Calvin!
- Are you in?
- Well, well, yes, yes.
I'm in.
Okay, now, know how this works.
It is our Ouija Table, we ask questions ...
And they give us answers.
"Yes", "no", lyrics by if want to spell something.
Numbers, if you want to give us numbers.
And of course, the handle.
The second piece we have is the pointer.
Sure ...
This is what We will be showing ...
Responses when do the questions.
We ask questions and move according ... what we believe the spirit says.
Something we do not move.
You see, the point is, if we do this, when we touch, should move alone.
In other word, created which is the spirit, moving through us.
You know what I mean?
There are some rules must be covered.
You should have started with that, come on.
It's okay, ready?
Rule number 1.
There are 3.
Number one, never ask him the spirit, as he died.
- Are you okay?
- How come?
Because ...
Call it a dramatic and tragic death.
You ask why and do not want revive it, again and again.
- Okay.
- So can you freeze the Table.
And no one can speak more and lose everything.
- Okay, understood.
- Are you okay?
Rule number two, never ask him a spirit, as you'll die.
- Are you okay?
- Why So?
Well, because No. 1, you may not know.
And number two, say if questions like going to die ...
Then your mind will create subconsciously, when the day which will tell.
- You will pass, so ...
- I'm outta here.
Where are you going ?
!
You said you'd stay.
Well, do not fret, I'm just going to the bathroom.
Be right back.
Finally, this is the most important.
So please ...
Just follow this rule.
Okay friend ...
Never leaves the Table, saying "goodbye" ...
All right.
Never.
Apparently if you say "goodbye"
all that does is leave open the Table.
Is it okay?
And it means that is open your world, our ...
And ... do not know what they can do.
Is it okay?
I just want to say, jumped all here.
Okay ...
So ...
- We will put ...
- Just let me make an approach.
This is the time to cut ...
Do you remember what we talked about?
Where ...
This is the time.
- Just a few seconds please?
- Do Not.
This is the time, I told you I would shoot everything else.
And now ended.
OK ...
Is anybody there?
- Ida?
- Say What?
Just ask if there was anyone there, but in another language.
I thought maybe not understand English, maybe another official language.
You're so sexy.
Hey, come on.
We have been doing this as something ... of time, making the same question.
- Is anybody there ?

Anyway, remember how we play Ouija night?
Yes Y ...
Okay, there's a girl I know from YouTube ...
YouTube ...
No, of course not, there are only 3 people ... of those with you know YouTube.
Number one, no voice.
Number two cigars session ...
I do not know that.
I do not know, because no you're man enough.
- Jesus.
- And No. 3, KC.
KC and Jojo.
Yes, if I'm a fan of voice.
But back to KC.
We continue to close it?
Guys can we move forward with this?
Will start at any second!
I want to look the best you can, she does not know, but I really like.
It's nothing stalker.
It is not a real person, brother.
It's a real person, just wait.
- Hi!
- Hi KC.
- Hi.
- I'm Michael.
I Annette.
Great, we're here to Ouija talk about it?
If ...
We are here to discuss the Ouija.
Anyway ...
The three and a couple of people more ...
We were playing the other night.
Stop there, first all, do not play ... with a Ouija, you play with cards or Nintendo ...
A Ouija Table is for communicate with the dead.
But why would you want communicate with the dead?
Why would you want to talk to someone?
Because they typically have something to say.
The Ouija Board is one of the unexplained phenomena in the world.
Think of The Bermuda Triangle.
Planes, ships disappeared mysteriously without evidence?
- I never thought of something.
- Still, a farmer in West Texas ... being observed with family, evaporated into the air.
- Say What ?
!
That happened ?
!
- Yup.
It's one of those things you can not explain.
Yes, but why are the spirits here then?
Because they have a message, want to move to our world.
Not necessarily all spirits are evil.
I like to think that there Some good spirits.
Those who are guardian angels or even protectors.
Are they dangerous?
I feel that the risk is low eyes, which uses the Table.
I mean, if you're sitting there, trying find a satanic spirit ...
It's probably what they get.
I think the best example is that there ... a girl named Doris California ...
And it is one of the Stranger activities ... which is still known.
She was at home and had been sexually assaulted.
And beaten by ghosts, had lots of prints ghosts.
Has videos, pictures;
The whole package.
Wait ...
It's not a movie?
Does the Entity or so?
Yay!
But you need not worry for anything.
As you follow the rules and always remember goodbye ...
- Yes Y ...
- Mention the rules and say goodbye ...
- We did it.
- I have a question ...
We said goodbye, we completely normal.
So, do not have nothing to worry about?
No ...
The table itself, not only used to communicate ...
As Well ...
It is a portal is a gateway to a different dimension.
If not goodbye ...
It's like leave your front door open.
Anyone can enter.
You mean to rape you?
Thanks guys bye!
Hey guys!
I want to plan something for tomorrow night.
- You're a fool.
- Watch this video on YouTube.
I think it's Antoine.
- Ready?
- Yup.
Let's do it.
I hope nothing happens weird again.
Is anybody there?
We have to keep trying right?
- In agreement ...
- Hello?
Anyone there?
- This is scary.
- Every time you move ...
Hey Gracie is that you?
Who do we talk?
Lisa.
- Okay ...
Hi Lisa.
- Hello Lisa.
Can we talk to Gracie?
Lisa, is not that want to talk to you ...
We wondered just ...
if it was okay with you ...
If we were talking to Gracie, and that we promised ...
You know ...
Talk to her today, so we can ...?
Do you talk to Gracie and then you?
- It's weird.
- Yes, I think so.
He agreed.
- I do not get used to that.
- I know.
Hello Gracie is that you?
Lisa?
It is moving.

The spirit, but may say the truth about a future event.
Or last, to get user confidence.
And never use the table in a cemetery, or where it happened a terrible death.
Doing it in these places, you can causing terrible manifestations.
This is very important.
Some believe that certain spirits remain on our map.
And contact the living, to give messages.
These messages usually have to do ... unresolved conflicts.
Now, these spirits can go from gentiles or liabilities ...
For sounds, voices or even appearing to users.
To force or be aggressive, to move things or physical contact ... with the living.
The others believe that ...
Something happened, I heard something behind.
Gracie is that you?

REAL LIVING OR DEAD, It is PURE COINCIDENCE
Is this even on?
Yes, it is.
Really
Please don't shake it too much.
Well, how do you use this thing?
You are somewhat amateurish aren't you.
I don't know how to operate a camera.
I just know how to be in front of a camera.
Well you get what you pay for these days right .
You didn't even pay me!
That's what I'm getting at.
Look, you wouldn't even know about this thing is, without me.
I didn't even know what this thing is.
But anyways, I got to get to my introduction, so let's turn to me.
Okay.
To the millions around the world.
Millions?
You only have 12 subscribers!
Okay, but I've got like 20 views.
Anyways this is Brandon.
Thanks for tuning in again.
We are in Dallas, Texas.
I don't know if you people are familiar with that.
And what takes place down here.
I don't really know either.
Other than the fact that we are about to make magic happen.
So tell us, give us a little bit about whats going on here.
Turn it to you.
We are going to Michael's Place.
Which is Calvin, my hot boyfriend's friend.
Oh great.
I'm turning off the car.
So here we go.
Is Michael going to be okay with you having the camera on?
Really ?
Yah..
It's okay.
I'll sweet talk him.
Do not forget that Calvin is the star.

So uh, Brandon, I know you love the whole film thing.
But Michael.. not so much.
Calvin:
Big black guy, buff.
Love it.
He'll be all in front of the camera.
He thinks he's a star.

You're sure excited, I appreciate that.
I'm so excited, and Michael's cute too.
Oh, how're you doing.

Great.
Can you go help?
I'm just playing.

He just make me speechless.
I'm so sorry.
She makes me feel alright.
If I can get this table in here and put down.
Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.
- Come on, come on.
Okay so, we are all here.
Can anyone tell us exactly, why..
we are here?
I can, uh in fact I would love to but first of all, that's..
got to go.
I don't like it.
I can't have the camera.
We can possibly get one million views.
No, turn it off please.
Who wants to be a millionaire?
- Brandon!
- Yes.
Thank you, Calvin!
Turn it off.
- Relax, baby.
- Thanks.
Oh look, the camera in my face again.
Look, all I need is 30 seconds.
That's all I'm asking.
Something interesting, please.
30 seconds..
Go!
You know Shay out there?
I do know Shay.
We're both in the NYFA.
And we can't fail.
What is NYFA?
New York Film Academy.
New York Film Academy?
Yes.
Isn't this Dallas?
Dump logistics make such interesting topics.
I don't know what that means.
With the camera here.
For what I wanna do.
I just don't think it's going to help.
In fact I don't think it will work.
What won't work?
I need specifics.
I know you do but..
Just give me this, we can't fail.
I'll make you a deal, If it will shut you up.
I'll tell you something.
Deal?
Deal.
Great.
What we are going to do is actually going be a uh...
Ouija board.
Oh my God, are you serious?
I know I know, right?
Shh...
Perfect!
I know, I am excited too but shh....
That's why I don't want that camera here.
I mean...
Ghost popped out.
They are not going to popped out in front of a camera.
I mean have you ever seen a good picture or video of a ghost.
"Twilight."
That's a movie and it's vampires.
So you're not even in the same room.
I just need you to cut it off.
Can you just give me something while we are out there?
I'll give you this.
There are somethings I have to go over, there's couple of rules I got to touch on.
Em..
I'll let you film that.
But once we start playing the board,
No more filming.
Sound good?
hat works.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Auto focus, good.
Light, great.
A lot of exciting things are about to happen.
I'm learning whats happening tonight.
I've learned there's going to be a Ouija board involved.
So there's going to be some creepy things, ghost adventures.
Who knows whats gonna happen here tonight.
But you won't find out unless you stay tune.
You know you really are pushing the boundaries.
I said I give you some camera time and now you want interviews.
Michael has been around forever.
You know he is Calvin's best friend so..
Well Calvin and La'Nette, I mean I've known them forever.
I mean the longest time
In fact since I moved here,
Calvin was the first few people I met when I got here
I don't know.
I don't even like him like that.
He's so silly!
Uh, me and Calvin had gone to the club.
We met at a nightclub, and it's the Luna Lounge.
- Luna lounge, and she..
- And it was about a month ago.
And uh.. we were both kind of flirting with this one girl.
And..
I broke off and I went to the bar, cos I wanna get a drink.
And I actually met Shay first .
And we actually chatted up for a minute.
And I was going to buy her a drink.
And then you know, here comes too small for his body shirt Calvin.
She had that beautiful satin red dress that was fitted to her body.
And it was just like banging it.
I was not wearing a red fitted dress.
Em..
And you know, he's around nobody else gets seen, so...
Him and Shay started talking and uh.
So that's kinda what that is, so..
Oh, yes, yes .
You remembered when I talked to you.
And I told you I had a dream about me and you on a beach, salsa dancing?
He is the most ridiculous thing ever.
And how a woman can sit there and believe what comes out of his mouth.
Okay ...
I was thinking about that night.
That night you was ..
what color were you wearing?
It was blue.
- Yes, yes.
- Strapless?
That's right, blue strapless dress.
It was wonderful...
She's the financial girlfriend.
You are wearing the watch.
Yes, oh yes.
She bought me this watch.
Beautiful.
- Look!
- A Rolex!
Then you have a hottie girlfriend, a sex girlfriend , a cute girlfriend..
I got a new car girlfriend, drive me around the block girlfriend.
Oh, do that again.
How much you want to bet.
Wait till she turns her head.
He was doing stuff like.
Hey, what's that over there?
What?
She's ... poor girl.
She is blind.
Is that it?
Are we done.
Sure.
Great, thanks.
I know you are all excited to find out why I gathered everybody here for tonight.
- Yes please..
- So here it is.
Drum roll please.
- Yah, sure.
- What we got here.
- Won't you hold that for me?
- Yup.
Thank you.
I'll get it.
Thank you.
And one of... this.
Oh shut the front door.
Hey, hey ,hey..
You don't even even know what it is.
I'm not crazy.
I can look at it.
It's is a Ouija board.
But, Haven't you ever been a bit just curious.
No!
Not even just a little?
No!
Well I am.
So I'm very excited in this.
Do you know why I'm not curious?
Why is that La'Nette?
Because Grand mama never raised no fool.
I'm not suppose to be here.
Isn't your grand mama dead?
Yah, probably from a Ouija board.
That's not possible.
Would you like to say hello thou?
No!
I'm excited!
Thank you, Shay.
Shay is excited.
Did they just high-five?
Now, first of all I just want to make sure everybody is in at least.
Okay.
Are you in?
- I'm here.
- Thank you La'Nette.
Shay ?
- I'm in.
- Thank you.
Calvin, on his phone right, all night, imagine that.
Calvin?
Are you in?
Okay, okay, okay, yah yah, yah..
I'm in, I'm in..
Alright.
Now this is what we are working with here.
This is our Ouija board, okay.
We ask it questions and it will gives us answers base on the..
Yes or no.
Letters if it wants to spell it out, or numbers if it wants to give us numbers.
And of cos "goodbye".
Alright.
2nd piece we got is the..
Pointer.
Right.
This is what it's going be kind of showing us the answers when we ask the questions.
We asked some questions and we move it according to what we think the spirit is telling us.
Kind of.
We don't move it though.
You see, the whole point is if we do this right.
When we are touching it,
It should it move on its own.
In another words, I think it's the spirits will move through us.
Oh my God!
You know what I mean.
There are some rules that do need to be covered.
We should start with it, come on.
- Okay, ready.
Rule number 1, there is three of them.
Number 1, Never ask a spirit how it died.
Okay.
Okay, uh, why?
Well uh. because let's say the spirit has this traumatic tragic death.
Right.
You asking it, you don't want it to relive that death.
over and over and over.
Okay.
So it may freeze the board up and then it won't talk to us anymore.
Then we just wasted everything.
- Alright, got it.
- Okay.
Rule Two.
Never ask the Spirit how you're going to die.
Okay.
Why ?
Well, because number 1 partly you don't want to know.
And num 2.
They say that if you asked it how you are going to die, then you mind is going to create it.
Subconsciously , when the day they say you are going to be there.
it's going to happen. so.
I'm out of here.
Where are you going?
You said you are going to stay.
Okay, don't forget.
I'm just going to the bathroom.
I'll be right back...
Okay last rule.
Alright guys this is the most important rule.
So please.
Okay.
Alright.
If nothing else, follow this one for me.
Okay man.
You never ever leave the board without saying goodbye.
Alright, not ever.
Apparently If you don't say goodbye, all it does is leave this board open.
Alright.
And that means they are open from their world to our world.
And..
I don't know what they can do.
Okay.
Boo!
I'm just wanna go on the record saying that everybody in here jumped.
Okay so, alright so.
Everyone kind of put their uh hand...
Just coming for a little close-up.
This is going to be that cut moment.
Like remember what we talked about.
Where it's ..
this is going to be that moment.
Can I just have a few more seconds, please?
No.
This is..this is that spot, remember I was like,
I let you film everything else, Now we are done.
Okay.
Is anybody there?
- Idah.. !
- What is that?
What?
I asked, 'Is anybody there' in a different language.
I figure it hadn't understand English, maybe another language might work.
You are so sexy...
- Oh ...
- Hey, come on.
We have been doing this for a while now, asking the same same question.
Alright.
Yo..yo..yo.
Is anybody there?
Brother.
Respect the board, remember.
I respect.
I'm just being myself.
Are you sure we are asking the right thing?
I'm not..
Is it the right question?
Just try, we try it one hand.
maybe we got too much going on.
- Okay.
- I told you it don't work.
Okay uh.
- Nothing here is real.
-Let's see.
Is that on still?
Michael!
Michael!
Michael!
Yes..
Wow.
Who moved it?
I know it's one of y'all.
Calvin..?
No, La'Nette moved it.
Why would I move it
Because I can see the white of your fingernails..
from the pressure you are pushing down on the plank and whatever it's call.
Just ask another question.
Uh..uh..
What's your name?
Oh, oh my gosh !
Oh man.
No way.
- Gracie?
- I don't know..
Gracie.
Uh..uh..
How old are you?
She is just a little girl.
Where are you?

Who is Joseph?
Bad.
Beware.
Bad.
Beware.
Oh man.
Can you guys. can you guys ask one spirit how another spirit died?
Uh..
It didn't say you couldn't.
- It didn't say you could .
Yah, but..
I don't know.
Ask.
Uh..

Oh my gosh.
How did Joseph die?
Yah.

- Oh!
- Jesus, man!
- It's is my phone.
- I'll crash your phone.
- I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?
Calvin, come on man.
Who is it?
Put your hand back on the board ..
put your hand back on the board.
Hold on.
Can I have a little bit of privacy, please?
Get out of here man.
Turn off the ...
You know.
We can all still play I mean I don't want to lose it.
We actually have something here, I do want to lose what we got.
- Yah, that's a great idea!
- Let's ask another question.
Let me go ask a question.
Okay!
Go ahead.
Who is he texting?
Oh no.
This is not going to be good.
Girl.. girl.
So uh, what's her name ?

So what did I miss?
What's going on?
We are glad you can join us.
-Thank you, thank you.
Yes.. very glad, you can join us.
- Hey, beautiful!
- So who were you texting?
Oh I was texting my mother.
Oh your mom.
Okay, what's her name?
My mother?
Her name is Theresa.
Oh really, that's funny, because the board said it's "B-L-R".
B-L-R..
Yah, I asked who were you texting and the board said your were speaking with a girl name initials of B-L-R.
Why are you asking a board about who I am talking too?
There is nothing wrong with that.
I mean, every time I ask you in person, you get mad.
And you say, oh it's nothing and you just blew me off.
And just like when..
Well first of all.
I don't get mad.
You always ask me who I am talking too and I'm telling you, I'm handling business.
Now I don't walk away every time I get texted.
I talk in front of you all the time.
How come you said your mother's name is Theresa, and this says "B-L-R"?
Ooh, such a conversation.
Maybe you should have alone.
Yes, we should..
alone in the car.
We should.
That's right, I apologize.
I'm sorry.
That's fine.
You can do this some other time.
We can just get back to the game and we can...
Where are you going?
Shay!
Its..
- Nice meeting you, Shay!
- Yes.

Come on, this is not my fault.
Yah, okay.
- Bye, brother.
- Bye.
You know he is not going to talk to me for at least another ...
Whoa .
Are you doing that?
Why would I do that?
I don't know.
I didn't know this thing could move if it was just the two of us.
Well, it is.
So just.. keep watching it.
BDRM?
I didn't even ask it a question.
I didn't either?
Did you?
Why would I?
You guys have not appreciated my work all night.
Of course.
Calvin.
Right before he left.
"Why don't you show yourself."

(card
- BLR )
Brandon, What are we doing here?
We are going online.
- And why do you have so many computers?
- I noticed, this is.. really weird.
- I want one, you got bunch of them.
Hey, hey.
You guys everheard this before.
Uh, don't ask questions you don't know the answer to.
Got it.
I got to go with you on that one.
Thanks.
So rude.
Anyways, remember we were playing with the Ouija-board the other night?
- Yup.
- Got it.
Yah, so, there is this girl I know from Youtube.
- Youtube.
- I love Youtube.
And oh .. "It's So Cold in the D...
(T.baby) "
That's how hilarious.
Did you see the girl in the background?
She just like : "Bang, bang".
Then she got her eyes like ... (chicken sound) No, not quite.
There are only three people on Youtube.
you need to know about.
Number 1, Lonely Island Boys.
Number 2, Cigarobsession ...
I don't know anything about that.
Yah, no you wouldn't because you are not man enough.
Jesus.
Yah, right.
And finally number 3, KC.
KC and Jojo!
Uuu yeah.. !
baby yeah...!
Uuu.. yeah..
Yeah, you know, time out, time out, time out.
I'm more of a Boyz 2 Men type fan.
Anyways back back to KC.
Are they still a band?
Yah, they are still a band,
They are still around.
Do you watch the "Tosh.
O".
Guys can we please get through this .
She's about to be online any second now.
And I want to look my best.
Because, she does not know it but I havea crash on her.
- Oh..
Brandon
- Its not stalkerish.
Its not stalkerish.
It's not even a real person probably.
It is a real person.
Just wait, wait, wait...
Hello ..
- Hey, KC!
- Hi.
Hey.
I'm Michael.
I'm La'Nette.
Great.
We are here to talk about the Ouija board right.
Yah, we are here to talk about the Ouija board.
So anyways, the 3 of us and a couple of other people.
We were playing with it the other night.
Let's stop right there.
First of all you don't play withthe Ouija board.
You played with the cards or a Nintendo.
A Ouija board is a medium used to communicate with the dead.
But why would you want to communicate with the dead?
Why would you want to talk to anybody?
Because, typically they have something to say.
The Ouija board itself is just one of the unexplained phenomenons in the world.
Think about the Bermuda Triangle.
Planes, boats disappearing mysteriously with no evidence or what so ever.
Yah, I heard about stuff like that.
Even in west Texas, a farmer being watched by his family, vaporized into thin air.
What?
That actually happen?
Yah, yah.
Yes, it's just one of those things you really can't explain.
But why are the spirits here then?
Because they have a message that they want to convey.
Not necessary all spirits are bad.
I like to think of spirits as good.
You know, guardian angels or protectors even.
Uh.
Are they dangerous?
I feel that danger is more in the eye of the beholder.
The eye of the user of the board.
I mean, If you are sitting there trying to conjure up you know, a satanic type spirit then that's probably what you will get.
I think the best example is ...
There is this chick named Doris from California.
And this is one of the most vulgar documented paranormal activities still known to men.
She was in her house and she had been sexually assaulted and beaten by ghosts.
She have a bunch of ghost adventure type people come up with recorded videos.
They got photos, the whole shebang.
Wait.
Wait, isn't it.. isn't it they made the movie "The Entity" about that.
Yes.
But you don't have to worry about any of that as long as you follow the rules and you always remember to say goodbye.
I did.
I make sure I lay the rules out.
And we definitely said goodbye afterwards.
We did.
But okay, I have a question then.
Uh, so we said goodbye and we did everything normal.
Do we have nothing, so we have nothing to worry about?
No.
It's just..
The board itself is not only used to communicate.
It's also... a portal.
It's a door to a whole another dimension.
If you don't say goodbye
That's like leaving your front door open.
Anyone can come in.
Oh.
- You mean like.. to get raped?
Like that Youtube 'Antoine.'
"hide your kids, hide your wife , everybody is getting raped."
Thank you guys, bye.
Hey..hey..hey..
Guys guys guys...
I want to schedule something for tomorrow night.
- With who?
- She's already gone.
You're so silly.
Look up that Youtube video thou, look I think it's 'Antoine'.
- 'Antoine', yeah.
- I'll do it, don't worry.
- Hide your kids, hide your wife, hahaha..
You ready?
Yup.
Let's do it.
Oh man, I hope you don't get creepy again.
Oh no, that was bad.
Go ahead.
Okay.
Is anybody there?
Maybe we lost it.
Well, we got to keep trying, don't we?
Hello.
Anybody there?
- Oh, it's creepy.
- Everytime.
Hey, Gracie!
Is that you?
Who are we talking to?
Lisa.
Okay.
Hi, Lisa.
Hey, Lisa.
Uh..
Can we talk to Gracie?
- 'NOT'
- What that mean?
No, like not her.
Oh, oh, okay.
Uh, Lisa, it's not that we don't want to talk to you.
We were just uh wondering if it is ok with you that we that we talk to Gracie.
Since we promised her we would you know talk to her today.
So, can we speak to Gracie and then we'll talk to you?
- That's weird.
- Yah, I think so.
She agree.
I cannot get used to that.
I know, right.
Hi, Gracie, is that you?
No..?
Lisa..?
Who could it be?
Oh.
It moving, it moving ...
J ...?
Joseph?
It's probably is...
Jesus!
Oh, we are screwed.
Brandon, can you go get the door please.
Go!
Hello?
Hello?
Hi
Oh hey, Shay.
- Perfect!
- I mean we are suppose to..
It's perfect.
Who are you guys talking to?
Uh, I think it's Joseph, we think.
Oh good.
I like to join in.
I have a question.
Okay.
So uh..
The other night, you said Calvin was talking to this girl, Blair.
Who is she?
- Friend.
- Friend
Its a friend..
it's a friend of Calvin's.
That night it said girl.
And this time I said who is she, it says it's a friend its a girlfriend.
That's suppose to be me.
Did Calvin meet this girl the same night he met me?
Was she.. was she wearing a red dress?
Does Michael know about this girl?
Yah, I mean ...
Does Michael know that Calvin was talking to this girl and to me at the same time?
Yes.
I do, I knew.
- Wow!
Really, Mike?
- You knew.
What?
Yes, I knew.
You know all about this and you didn't tell me!
Why would I tell you.
Calvin is my best friend.
What am I to you?
Shay, come on..we just met.
This has nothing to do with it.
I thought we were friends ...
I thought we were friends.
Look, I known Calvin a lot long...
And all these time you pretended he's texting somebody.
Classic, classic.
Absolutely classic.
This is Smooth.
And you were sitting down there asking who is she.
No, you don't know.
You pretended like you don't know anything.
- I didn't know.
Shay, I'm not about to throw my best friend under the bus just..
Don't yell at her, don't yell at her.
She's already upset.
I'm not yelling at her.
La'Nette, why you got to be involve in this anyway?
Oh my god.
I'm not trying to be involve in this.
This is ridiculous.
What kind of guy, what kind of guy pretends like that.
It's not right.
You sat here.
We were just at the board.
And you knew, you just..
- It's not my business to be involved in their business.
Shay wait.
Shay come on.
Shay wait.
So, final thoughts with Brandon here.
That went really well, I think.
We got a lot of great stuff.
I hope you guys out there are enjoying it.
Below.
Click on the link for "Cheaters", they have brought you here, this tonight.
- And tomorrow night we are going to hope to contact the ghost who uh..
looking for alimony check.
- Brandon !
Yes, can I help you?
- Come on.
Put that thing down, let's go!
- No, I can't.
Come on.
It's chaos out here.
This is ridiculous!
Did somebody die?
It doesn't matter.
Come on before someone does die ...
Alright fine, just hold on a second.
- Oh, hurry up!
- I got to put down my camera.
Oh, what a night.
Every night.
It's always on me.
Cause I know what's going on.
Calvin can't keep his dick in his pants.
That's my fault.
Sure, why not?
The board.
Hello.
Uh..
I'm going to say goodbye.
So I going to put this here.
Goodbye?
I said it.
You said it.
Everyone is happy.
Right?
Yah .
That's it.
That will be fine.
Brandon, what's up?
Yah man.
Heh, thanks again, for taking her.
I don't know man.
It's not my problem.
The piano?
Oh, there it is.
Yah, you did leave it.
Yah, I'm looking right at it.
Yup.
Okay.
Yah, I'll hold it.
Just come get it tomorrow.
Alright, thanks.
A camera, huh?
Oh, look at that .
Huh.
Oh hey guys.
Welcome back to the Brandon show.
I'm still stuck in the closet.
That's why I'm so pissed off at the world and hate everybody.
Haha.
Whatever.
Is that a joke?
Brandon, is that you?
Come on.
Are you playing a trick on me?
Come on.
All right.
It's a trick.
It's a trick.
He is messing with you.
"GREETINGS.
GREETINGS.
PLEASE MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME. "
"Don't mind the open grave.
We'll let you know if its for you."
Oh my god.
You know what Brandon.
I hate you.
Okay, Mr. Camera.
You are here because I just got a phone call from Mike.
All weird out saying he is hearing things.
Because we forgot to say goodbye.
How did we possibly forget to say goodbye?
It's the first rule.
Now Shay is over here, irritating me to death.
Because of my brother.
I'm sorry, Michael.
Yah.
Okay, talk to you tomorrow.
Goodbye.
I'm sorry.
I was just really hurt and confused.
And I don't know what to do.
I understand, don't worry.
You don't have to keep apologizing.
All I'm saying is, if we start hearing stuff over here.
You better Jackie Chan their asses.
But I'm not Chinese.
Oh girl don't worry about it.
You know you Asians know all the same karate.
How about I just make it up?
Tomorrow we'll say goodbye.
Oh, you damn right we're going to say goodbye.
Somebody going to say goodbye.
Alright.
I'll record everything.
This'll teach you to leave the camera in my house.
Douche.
That shows that I'm man for that.
You might know what it is.
This is my La'Nette doll.
Uuu...
Shhh...
La'Nette, if you do ever see this
I just want you to know that...
I may have just a little..
teeniest, teeniest, tiniest... *uck.

(Scream) Ahh....!
- Oh, God!

You are losing your mind girl.
Oh my gosh.
I was on the phone.
I was talking to Mike.
I saw something.
Over there.
You saw something, where?
Right there.
There's nothing out there.
Girl, you got us..
It's probably all this Ouija-board talk.
Oh my God, girl.
You almost scared my jaws off.
Okay.
You're probably right.
I'm sorry.
Go to bed.
-Good night.
- Good night.
Here we are again Youtube.
It's Brandon.
I found my camera.
And we are going back to the devil's den tonight.
Who knows what's going to happen with the Ouija board.
Somebody could be cheating.
Somebody could be missing.
I don't know, you got to stay tune.
Let's go.
Too crazy.
How's Shay doing?
I mean she's good.
She sounds better than you.
What's wrong with your voice?
All the yelling and screaming just got me all irritated.
What's up nerd?
What are you doing here?
Hey guys, I got my camera back so I'm ready to film.
I see that.
You know what I'm going to do?
I'll take a roll of duct tape and just tape that literally to your face.
I was try to do another Witchboard (movie).
What's a Witchboard?
I don't know
Tawny Kitaen, Whitesnake video girl.
Here I go again on my own..
If, if you just agree to shut up.
We let you keep filming.
That's was a, that was a great idea.
Alright, let's do it the right way.
- That's why you are here.
- Here to serve.
- Okay, go ahead.
Alright.
Is anybody there?
Is anybody there?
- That's fast.
- Yah.
Who are we speaking to?
It's Gracie.
Oh it's Gracie.
Hey, girl, hey!
It's a ghost, La'Nette.
- I think we are cool.
- Whatever.
So, Gracie, last night we were talking to Joseph.
And we didn't say goodbye to him.
So we are actually wondering, if it'll be alright if we say goodbye to him today.
Is he around?
Let's play.
She wants to play.
Oh, honey.
You are so sweet.
Still a ghost!
Still think it's cool.
But uh, like Michael said, sweety.
We really didn't get the chance to say goodbye to Joseph last night.
And that's really important.
So if we could.
Can we just speak to him real quick.
N-T, neither...
- Not.
- Neither.
N-T.
Not, not.
- Not.. oh.
- N-T.
Not.
H-R.
Not hour.
Not here!
You don't think we let him out, do you?
- Every time.
-Keeps happening.
Brandon, will you get the door please.
I can't
- Just get the door.
-Come on.
Do your job
- Alright, alright.
- Jesus.
The door is open!
- Thanks, Brandon.
- Thanks.
Oh look, it's Calvin.
Hey, what's up Cal.
Hey brother.
- Hey, brother.

Get that damn camera out of my face.
Get that damn camera out of my face!
Yo!
Alright, you seem a little tense.
- Michael.
- Ya.
You got something to say to me?
No.
Then uh..
Shay came over here the other night?
Yah, she came by.
Okay.
What you talk about?
We didn't talk about anything.
She wants to use the board.
What you tell her?
I didn't tell her anything.
Why?
Why..
Wow, you even like you don't even know whats going on.
I don't know what's going on.
Okay, you know we broke up, right?
No, I didn't.
And..
Yah, we broke up last night.
You want to know why?
Yah ?
Cos somebody been running their mouth, telling her about Blair!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You said it's my fault?
Yah, it's your fault!
No, it's not my fault.
I didn't do anything.
How she know about Blair, huh?
How she know that night at the club.
Whoa, I didn't tell Shay nothing.
Please man!
You were the one who tried to talk to her first.
- Don't talk to me in my face.
- Get your hands off me man.
You were the one who tried to talk to her first.
Guys, guys...!
Stop it, stop it!
Yah, so what.
That's the reason why!
Okay, you know what.
Calvin, how long have we known each other?
10 years?
Huh.
How many girlfriends I ever stole from you?
None!
Zero!
Do you think I'm going to do that to you now?
We are boys.
Calvin.
I've known you for way too long .
I am not going to steal your girlfriend.
I don't give a shit about who wants to talk to her first.
You think I care about some girl at the club.
10 years of friendship over that?
Please.
I have known you way too long.
I always have your back.
Just like you always have my.
Over some girl?
Are you going to talk to me?
So how she find out?
She asked the board.
I know it sounds like nut, but she asked the board thou.
The board.
Yah.
She asked the board.
That's what she was doing over here.
All right.
Okay, it's fine.
Excuse me..
Excuse me.
What are you you doing?
What I don't understand, is how a piece of board with a what, bifocal magnifying glass in there.
Has some type of magical powers, to tell somebody about something I did.
I don't know man.
I don't understand.
It was the board.
Why talk to me.
Okay.
Alright.
That's fine man.
It was the board.
Yes.
Okay.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Where are you going?
Yo!
- Look man.
- Let him go.
Don't walk upon me man.
You know what.
When you are ready.
When you are ready to tell the truth to me.
You can come get your board.
Because it's going with me right now.
So, it's going to be like that?
It's like that.
Oh.
Oh God.
What was that?
Are you okay?
Yah, I'm fine.
All this is ..is out of control.
Everything is out of control.
It's not good.
So it's going to be my fault.
Stupid game.
It's just a board that he took.
He took the board.
- Oh, shit!
- We didn't say goodbye.
Who were we talking to?
The creepy little girl ghost.
Oh, Gracie.
I like to take this time to thank Casper the friendly ghost who brings this, this beautiful moment.
Why are you here?
Because apparently between the two of you.
Someone got an F in following the directions in school.
How about this for direction.
Direct your ass out of my house.
Fine, that's fine.
I've got all the footage that I need.
- I don't need to see you guys again.
- Perfect.
How about this for footage.
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
I'll trip you..
How about this for footage.
Okay , Mr. Camera.
So my pig headed brother decides to get all upset.
And he takes the board.
Which means we don't say goodbye - again.
This is getting ridiculous.
And you know what else.
I don't need no weird little spirit ghost running around my house.
So this is what I'm going to do.
I'm going to keep you on, and you're going to watch me.
Because I know for a fact, that they don't like to be on film.
And now I got to be up here getting my paranormal activity on.
Shoot one and two.
This is getting crazy.
Alright.
So, got to keep you up all night.
Got a full battery.
Good night.
Holy shit.
Wait, wait, wait ....
What?
What?
Okay ...
Keep it together.
Keep it together.
This is my house.
Keep it together.
What.
Hell no...!
Okay ..
Okay..
Please, Mr. Camera.
Tell me you got that.
Tell me you got it.
I got to tell Mike
Shit.
The board works.
You're not going to believe what I just found on the internet.
Gracie..
is the daughter of Lisa.
What !
Yah.
Lisa..
is the mother of Gracie.
And Joseph was their next door neighbor.
He was a little slow, rain manish.
But here, here's the interesting part.
What?
Joseph drowned Gracie.
No.
And Gracie's mother, Lisa.
She..
she killed Joseph in revenge.
Have you told anyone else yet?
No, not yet.
I thought about calling KC and just running it by her.
Yah, maybe.
She knows more about this than us.
Um, my stuff is really weird on my end.
Alright so..
I'm going to call La'Nette to see if anybody else got weird stuff going on.
And find out what you can and get back to me.
Okay.
I will, I will.
Alright, thanks Brandon.
Alright, see you man.
Alright cool and here we go.
Alright, look Michael.
Now I'm setting up this camera because you said the Ouija-board was saying this, this and that.
And I'm telling you, I don't believe it worked.
So, I'm about to try it out right now.
Alright.
Yah, I don't believe this work.
Okay.
Is anybody there?
No?
Is.. anyone there?
Hold on a bit.
Be right back.
Immature.
Alright, alright, alright.
Michael.
Since you're the what, the genius on the Ouija-boards.
Look, I just tried it.
I don't believe it.
It don't work.
So that tells me.
That you told Shay about Blair.
Hold on.
Hey.
Who're there?
Shay, is that you?
Did you come back for daddy?
Hey, hey..
Hey!
Hey.
Who're here?
Look, I don't know karate, but I know crazy.
Hey!
Ha!
Michael, Michael, Michael!
See man, I know you told Shay about Blair.
Because there ain't no other way she would know.
I tried the Ouija-board.
I don't believe it.
So you know what that tells me?
That Ouija-board don't ...
Yah.
I'm setting it up right now.
Okay.
Go ahead.
Slow down.
Whose in your house?
I have been hearing stuff, but nothing like that.
Come on La'Nette.
There has been a lot going on.
Yah, like the Ouija board and the fighting.
Are you sure maybe you didn't hallucinated a little?
Okay, okay.
You didn't hallucinate it.
Oh, Shay also.
So I talked to Brandon earlier today.
Long story short.
Basically, he was saying that, there is a connection through all of this.
And I think, that could be it.
I do not know.
I mean I found my own stuff out.
I did some research and I found something out that's very creepy today.
Yah, alright.
So you know Gracie?
The little girl you think you saw.
The little girl you saw in your house.
Yah.
She..
actually died, on my birthday.
April 29.
Your birthday.

I doubt it.
But still..
Yah, I'll keep the camera going.
Yes, all the time.
Yes, it's on right now.
Alright, you'll do the same.
And Shay's going to do also.
Okay.
Alright I guess, If you see something, just let me know.
All right.
Alright, bye La'Nette.
Jesus ...
You need to clean up your bows too.
You've been playing with them too long.
You need to get the dirt outside.
Do they know how to swim?
They swim forwards and backwards?
Alright I don't know what it was, but I heard something back there.
Let's see if I can find out what it is.
- They swim forward and backward?
- Yes.
So, you taught them how to swim huh.
Uh huh.

On that note, I want to go to the little girl's room.
Something a little more exciting may take place.
Good luck to you.
You believe me, right?
Of course, I believe you.
Of course.
Thanks.
Alright, so I want you all to see this.
After last night,
I know you all think I am crazy.
But I know what I saw, alright.
"A spirit might tell the truth about the future event or past to gain the trust of the user. "
"And never use the Ouija in a grave yard or place where terrible death had occurred."
Playing in these places might cause terrible manifestations. "
This is really important thou.
"Some believe that certain spirits remain on our plane"
And contact the living for the purpose of relaying certain messages.
"Those messages usually pertain to unresolved conflicts or issues"
"Now these spirits, can range from being gentle or passive - "
- by noises, voices or even appearing into the users.
To forceful or aggressive, by moving things or even physical contact with the living.
"Others also believe that ..."
Something just happened.
There's a noise in the back.
Gracie?
Is it you?
Calvin!
Where are you?
Where is Blair?
What is she doing here?
You have a lot of explaining to do to me.
What's this?
Is this even on?
Calvin?
Why are you calling me?
I knew it was you.
What ?
Gracie and I are just getting ready for our weekend trip as a family.
Is this Blair?
Why are you playing games?
Don't be silly.
Don't talk like that.
Where is Calvin?
Put him on the phone.
Now!
You know what?
That's it.
I'm coming over.
What's this?
Calvin?
Hey!

Andele (hurry up).
Come on.
We need you all clean up.
Let me get you behind your ears.
You don't want to make us late, do you?
George has been planning on going to his farm all month long.
And he doesn't want us to be late.
All the chickens and goats and baby ducks.
Won't you like that?
All weekend?

Of course you want to go.
Picnics and pony rides.
You're going to love it.
He doesn't like me!
Stop talking like that.
Of course he does.

He loves me.
He loves us.
And he wants this weekend to be perfect.
So I don't want you acting up and being a brat, and messing it up for me.
Do you hear me?
George is going to be here any minute so..
We need to get you all pretty with your new dress.
Okay?
Can Joe come with us?
Joseph Wheeler next door?
Honey, you got to stop playing with him.

Has he ever touched you?
Hello?
Lisa.

Lisa, I told you I can't.

We can have a picnic go and I can bake a pie.
Lisa, stop it.
You see.

Announcer:
Copsis filmedon location with the men and women of law enforcement.
All suspects are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.
Officer Wesley brown:
Amarillo is a nice town.
We're about 200,000 people.
It's big enough to where there's stuff to do, there's plenty of stuff to get into, and it's small enough to where it still has a small-town atmosphere and it's a great place to raise a
family, and I hope to spend many, many more years here.
(Garbled radio transmission)
We're downtown, going to do a area check.
It's the weekend.
People are going out.
Like to have a good time but drink too much, so we make sure nobody's fighting or anything.
Looks like we got a fight right here.
We'll get out and check it out.
(Shouting)
Chill out!
Chill out!
Chill out!
Chill out!
Chill out!
Brown:
Hey, hey.
Come here, come here.
Dude, dude.
Brown:
Get down.
Get back.
Get back.
Chill out.
I'm not doing nothing.
I'm not doing nothing.
Brown:
Don't move!
Don't touch me.
Stay down.
Brown:
Have 'em step it up.
It's too late.
You want to fight with the cops right here?
(Clamoring)
Hey, don't leave.
Brown:
Tase him.
Got it?
Brown:
Get out.
Go.
(Taser clicking)
No, no, no, no.
Officer Devin Cantwell:
Turn around.
Put your hands behind your back.
Put your hand behind your back now!
Put your other hand behind your back.
Get it back.
Get everybody back.
Get everybody back.
Get everybody back.
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.
Cantwell:
I'm gonna lock you up.
Dude, I really didn't do...
I didn't do anything.
What are you doing?
(Man shouting in distance)
(Phone ringing)
Hear my phone.
I really didn't want to try anything with you guys.
Brown:
What were you all fighting about?
I have no idea.
I have no idea.
Brown:
You have no idea what you were fighting about?
No, I didn't start a fight with you.
Brown:
You were sitting out here fighting, and they were holding you back.
I didn't start any fight with anybody.
Brown:
When I pulled you off of him, you were still fighting.
I took you to the ground, I said, "stop fighting."
And you continued to fight.
You grabbed ahold of my leg.
I'm sorry, dude, but I did not start a fight with you.
Brown:
You were fighting out here.
Yeah, but, like, I'm not starting a fight with you at all.
I didn't mean to at all.
So I'm sorry, dude.
Brown:
Do you not understand what a police uniform is?
Like...
Brown:
That we're police officers?
Have a seat.
That's fine, dude, but I did not start a fight with you you at all.
Cantwell:
Hey, where's that bouncer that was helping us?
Brown:
I'll go get him in a second.
He's somewhere...
The black guy over there.
Sit down.
Do you understand why we tased you?
No.
Brown:
We told you to quit, you wouldn't stop resisting.
You jumped up.
I did not jump up.
Brown:
You jumped up.
You threw me on the ground.
Brown:
You're right, I threw you on the ground.
I was trying to put you under arrest.
Exactly, but, like, you threw me on the ground...
Brown:
And you kept fighting.
I did not try to fight with anybody.
Brown:
Okay, well, put your foot in there.
I did not try to fight with anybody.
I'm sorry, dude.
Like, I did not try to fight with anybody.
Brown:
Watch your knees.
Watch your toes and knees.
Cantwell:
What happened?
Brown:
I come out here and they're fighting.
So we go to-
- We go to break it up, and he swings his arm back.
And so I grab ahold of him and he starts pushing off of me.
So I take him to the ground and I tell him, "quit fighting."
And he pushes up off me and grabs hold of my legs.
So we took him back down to the ground, and...
Cantwell:
Well,Igot out and I see-
- I saw y'all go to the ground.
Brown:
I saw an officer show up, so I said let's get off and tase him 'cause he's not being compliant.
Cantwell:
That was me.
Brown:
Well, then you hit him, and...
Cantwell:
I didn'tgetagood spread at all.
I think I got him in the belt.
Brown:
I tased him in-- It looked like his chest.
Brown:
So you're the bouncer?
Yeah, I'm the bouncer.
Brown:
What happened?
He was the one that had-
- He was the one that was on the back of your shirt.
That's why I took him and I slammed him on the ground.
Brown:
The one in the black and red shirt?
The one in the black and red shirt was the one on the back of you trying to help his friend out.
So I took him and I slammed him to the ground.
Brown:
Why were they fighting in the club?
He threw a punch before y'all even rolled up.
Brown:
Why were they fighting in the club?
Because his-
- One of them, one of these guys that's in the police car-
- Bumped into the other party.
That's why I put them out first instead of the other party.
Brown:
Okay.
So those two guys are buds and they were fighting the other...
These two guys are buds and they were fighting.
Brown:
Okay.
So that's why I took them and slammed them on the ground, because he had you by the back.
Brown:
Cool.
All right.
Why didn't you stop fighting once you knew it was officers?
I did not-
- I did not act with you at all.
Brown:
You didn't what?
I did not act with you at all.
I didn't interact with you at all.
Brown:
You didn't-
- You didn't...
Ididnot.
Brown:
You didn't feel me throw you to the ground and tell you to quit fighting?
No, dude.
You threw me on the ground and then you fucking shocked me...
No, dude, like, I did not interact with you at all.
Not at all.
Brown:
You know why you got tased?
No.
Brown:
Because you wouldn't stop resisting arrest.
No, no, no.
Don't-
- Don't tell me that.
'Cause I did not interact with you.
I fucking told my home boys to go home.
All I said was like, "we need to go home, we need to go home."
Like, all I did is, like, walk on the sidewalk and say, "we need to go home."
Like, I needed to go home to my kids.
I needed to go home to my children.
Like, I do not want to fight with anybody.
I do not want to interact with anybody.
All I want to do is go home.
And you shocked the fuck out of me, dude.
Like, why would you do that?
Brown: 'Cause you were fighting.
You were resisting.
No, dude.
No, I did not.
I did not interact with you at all.
All I said was, "leave me alone."
Brown:
And we told you to put your hands behind your back and you wouldn't stop.
And all you did is grab me and throw me on the floor.
Brown:
Well, I'm not going to argue.
I'm not going to argue with you, because I'm right...
Why did you even throw me on the floor?
I'm not going to argue with you 'cause I'm right, you're wrong.
You're going to jail.
Have a good night.
I'm sorry, but you're not right.
Cantwell:
We're going to go ahead and transport him out to Potter county.
Brown:
Okay.
Just book him for resisting arrest and disorderly conduct.
He's obviously intoxicated.
Deputy Matthew Laslo:
When I lived in Ohio, I was in the army, and I was military police.
I really enjoyed it.
It's something I wanted to carry on.
I came down here to the county of Hillsborough.
You know, doing the patrol job right now, I'm learning a lot every day.
Every call teaches you something different, and it's great.
And I couldn't ask for anything else, so this is where I want to be, and I'm happy to be here.
(Indistinct radio transmission)
We're dispatched to a call.
Apparently, there's a subject down the street here having trouble with his neighbor.
Apparently, he's got a gun on his hip.
Having some neighbor trouble.
So I'm gonna head down here and see what's going on.
(Car door opens)
(Men shouting)
Hey, what's going on?
Here's the resolution.
Laslo:
Hey!
We got kids over here!
You coming with a pistol!
I understand.
I understand.
Laslo:
Hey, what's going on?
Yes, sir.
Hi.
Laslo:
Come over here.
I was threatened.
No, you was not threatened!
Laslo:
Threatened by who?
Yes, sir.
Laslo:
Make sure you keep your hands away from the pistol.
I will take this away from you completely.
I will allow you to take it away from me completely.
Laslo:
Okay.
I own this property right here.
And I came off my property, and was pulled off my property.
Laslo:
Okay.
So, I will not touch this.
Laslo:
Okay.
I will...
Laslo:
Isit loaded?
Yes, sir, it is.
Yes, sir, it is.
Laslo:
Turn around.
Turn around.
Stop!
Stop where you're at!
All right, what else you got on you?
That's it.
Officer...
Laslo:
Okay.
All it was, a man in a wheelchair that he said that, that knows him, he said that he didn't want him over here knowing the scent on his property.
He ain't got no business doing that there!
They got five kids...!
Laslo:
Easy, easy!
Who are you?
That's my fiancé.
That my wife.
Laslo:
Okay, where does he live at?
Right here.
Laslo:
And where do you guys live?
I stay right here.
He stay right here.
He came into my yard with a gun because my dog was was barking.
With a gun!
Laslo:
Okay.
I'm protecting my property and my-my well-being.
Laslo:
Okay.
I have been threatened by these neighbors several times.
I have talked to them very nicely and very calmly and very, very easily about the problems that we have had.
And there's been numerous problems about drug dealing, dogs that are being abused, dogs that are, that are violating county ordinances, and very suspicious activity.
Now, I heard a lot of noise last night that was...
Last night, when I say last night, I mean this evening.
A lot of strange noises and strange threats.
I was on my property, my property and armed myself with my firearm from my property, and said, "does anybody have a problem with me?"
And immediately, they came over, and they had all kinds of problems with me.
Laslo:
What were you planning on doing with that?
What were you gonna plan on doing with that?
I called you.
Laslo:
Okay, but you just walked up here without calling us.
I did.
Laslo:
Are you the one that called us tonight?
Yes, absolutely, sir.
Laslo:
Okay.
Absolutely.
So please help me...
Laslo:
Okay.
Deal with this situation.
Laslo:
Okay, what do you want us to do?
Tell them to quit hassling me and to stop the dogs.
Laslo:
Okay, well, they're allowed to have dogs, sir, okay?
I know.
And yes, yes, sir, I understand that and I called because the dogs were keeping me awake tonight.
They're horrible the way they treat those dogs.
Laslo:
Okay, well, I mean, that's not your problem.
I mean, you got your own stuff to worry about right here.
Right, I understand that.
I understand that.
And I am not here, I am, I am not intending to create problems for you or anyone in this neighborhood.
(Dog barking in distance)
Laslo:
Okay, guys, what, what's the major issue here?
The major issue is my dog, I guess.
Laslo:
Yeah, he said he doesn't like how the dogs are being loud.
I mean, I can't stop my dog from barking.
What you want me to do?
Laslo:
I-I told him that.
I just told him, "what do you want me to do, tie my dog mouth up?"
Laslo:
Is that the only issue?
There's cats, yeah, there's there's cats all around here now.
If my cats, if my dogs see a cat, he's gonna bark.
My dog see a shadow, my dog see that light come on, he's gonna bark.
Laslo:
Okay.
You know what I'm saying?
I can't stop my dog from barking, period.
Laslo:
Okay.
And I think I just read the law that it said that you can't do nothing about your dog barking.
Laslo:
He, uh, he checked him out.
Hernandez:
I'm gonna have 'em run the gun before we give it back.
Laslo:
Yeah, that's what I was just coming to do right now to get the, uh, serial number.
Hernandez:
Okay.
Laslo:
Did he already write it down or...?
Hernandez:
No, I'll just give him, I'll just show him.
Laslo:
Okay, okay.
All right, we're gonna run the serial number on the gun, see what it comes back to.
So, we'll go over here and talk to this guy again.
You're not a judge, I know that.
Officer Frank Hernandez:
Yeah, well, probably the best idea.
Yes, sir?
Laslo:
Okay, we're still checking things out, so...
Yes, sir, I understand.
Laslo:
Okay, so, I mean, people are allowed to have dogs.
They're gonna bark, okay?
Yes, sir.
Laslo:
So, I mean, it's a neighborhood.
I understand.
Laslo:
People live close to each other.
There's nothing you can really do about it besides move somewhere else.
Right.
Laslo:
You understand?
Yes, sir, I do understand that.
Laslo:
I'm not telling you to move, I'm not telling them to move 'cause I can't make them move, okay?
I understand.
Laslo:
Were you here first?
Yes.
Laslo:
Okay.
I mean, it doesn't really matter, okay?
So...
Yes, you're right, it doesn't.
Laslo:
So as far as that, I don't know what to tell you.
Okay, that's fair enough.
No, I understand that.
Laslo:
But we can't be walking over there with the gun.
This is not the old west.
No, you're-you're totally right.
You are totally right.
I was in the wrong.
I was completely in the wrong doing that.
Laslo:
You want to apologize so we can squash this?
Yes, sir, absolutely.
And I will do so.
Laslo:
All right, let's go.
Okay.
Stay, stay behind me.
Hey, Kenneth's got something he wants to say.
I apologize.
I made a big, big mistake.
A big mistake.
I'm sorry.
I overreacted about the dog.
I'm really sorry.
You and I have met.
We've gotten together.
Yeah, you come here every day about the dog.
I'm really sorry.
I apologize.
I never ever should have come over here with a firearm on my side;
That was a mistake.
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
I got five kids, and you came with it.
Sir, that was a mistake on my part big-time.
All right.
I owe you a huge apology.
You owe my girl an apology, too.
And your girl and all your family.
Aw, dude, man, I really apologize.
I'm sorry.
The dog drove me nuts, okay?
Yeah, but I can't stop my dog.
No, no, it's not your fault.
It's my fault.
Yeah.
I overreacted.
It was my fault.
Yeah.
No, sir, you and I have talked.
Everything's okay.
I really apologize.
Laslo:
All right, Ken, let's go back over there.
We're gonna give you your pistol back.
Thank you, sir.
Laslo:
But remember what you told me.
You're not gonna bring it out here.
Yes, sir.
Laslo:
And you're not gonna wear it on your hip anymore 'cause this is not the old west.
Yes, sir.
Laslo:
All right?
Yes, sir.
You're totally complete, sir, and I understand that.
Laslo:
Okay, one of these deputies has your firearm, okay?
That's fine, sir.
And if he unloaded it or whatever, I understand.
Laslo:
What's that?
Everything's settled.
Hernandez:
All right.
Laslo:
We made our peace.
Hernandez:
All right, Kenneth, everything's squared away and under control.
Yes, sir.
Laslo:
All right, why don't you go ahead and go inside.
I'm gonna go in, have a glass of milk, and go to bed.
Laslo:
Sounds good.
Okay?
Laslo:
All right, Kenneth.
We'll see you later.
Deputy Carlos Diaz:
Did a tour in Afghanistan, came back in '05.
Before that, I was working on computers, and as a side job, I was a dj.
There's a little bit of everything in this town, even though it's a small area.
Got on with the belle glade pd, and then sheriff's office took us over, and I've been here ever since.
We're checking out with an alarm that's at glade central high school.
Usually, when the alarms go off at glade central, there are usually someone probably breaking in and it's not a false alarm.
So we have most of the units arriving as we speak.
(Garbled radio transmission)
(Car door opens)
They get them down this way.
Okay, this is a fire hydrant, possibly what they used to gain entrance to the building, smashing out the window.
And their objective is to steal the projectors, as you can see.
But we got two in custody out there, and the third one's running around.
So we're gonna leave that alone and with a k-9, so he can get a good track on that.
This is probably his backpack.
Sergeant Richard Raasch:
Did you see him running?
Diaz:
No.
The guy said that they advised they ran due west.
And there was a vehicle there and a vehicle there, so I don't think he made it outside the perimeter.
Raasch:
Okay.
Diaz:
So...
Raasch:
Do we know if he's still inside or no?
Diaz:
I don't know.
We got his cell phone, though.
Hey, what's up?
What y'all come here to do, bro?
Hmm?
Diaz:
What y'all come here to do?
Well, he told us to come with him.
We ain't know what he was doing.
He came-
- They came and got in three rooms.
Diaz:
Who's he?
(Suspect mumbles)
Okay.
All right.
There's his hammer right there.
Diaz:
Yeah.
We got the other two projectors over there.
Did you guys come out of that window?
I didn't, but he did.
Diaz:
He came out that window?
Yes, sir.
Diaz:
Do you know if you heard anything smashing or breaking?
Probably what he dropped.
Diaz:
Five-bravo-12-two.
Uh, k-9 unit en route?
Did the, uh, kid come out that window or did he go into it?
Yeah, he came out.
Diaz:
Did you guys start running at the same time?
Yes, sir.
Diaz:
Okay.
What's eta on k-9?
No idea.
Diaz:
Okay.
Come on, guy.
Hey, do me a favor.
Tuck this knee in.
No, in, in, in, in, in.
I'm gonna roll you, okay?
Get on your knees.
You all right, man?
All right.
Listen, why are you doing this?
Have you done this before, man?
No.
Diaz:
This is your first time?
First time.
Diaz:
Ever?
Ever.
He was telling me that his buddy did...
His buddy does it all the time.
(Helicopter passing overhead)
Diaz:
You want to check him, since it's yours?
What do you say, eh, come with me just to do this quick thing?
They told me to come along.
Diaz:
All right, go ahead, man, have a seat.
(Patrol car engine starts)
His keys are in, uh-
- The rest are with the rest of the stuff, all right?
Listen, man.
You got to think about it, man.
You got to be smarter than that, you understand me?
Yes, sir.
Diaz: 'Cause I'm serious, bro.
I-I don't understand what you were thinking.
You got no criminal record, and you're going to the criminal justice academy.
And your buddy just said, "hey, let's go and do this real quick."
You didn't-
- I-I just don't understand why you didn't say,
"hey, nah, man, I'm cool, man."
Think about it, all right?
All right.
Diaz:
Just sit tight for a second.
Backpack is right there.
Deputy James Barca:
All right, and two of them got caught?
Diaz:
Two of them got caught just down there, and they said they all saw the cars at the same time.
Barca:
Uh-huh.
How far north did they say?
Diaz:
Uh, they said that they all ran together, so it couldn't be too far.
Barca:
Palm beach county sheriff's office k-9 unit!
Opportunity to surrender yourself before I unleash the police dog, which will bite you!
Identify yourself now!
(Dog barking)
Sheriff's office k-9 unit!
Last and final opportunity to surrender yourself before I unleash the police dog!
You will be dog bit!
Find him.
Yep, there.
Got him?
Barca:
Puckett!
Puckett!
Puckett!
Puckett!
Get him.
Get him, get him, get him.
Stay off the radio, guys.
All right, all right!
All right, all right, all right!
Barca:
Ah, good, found him.
Good, Puckett!
All right, all right!
Barca:
Good, Puckett!
All right!
Sir, I'm not!
Barca:
I'm gonna get you out.
Hold on for me.
Diaz: 22...
Barca:
Comeoutwithhim.
Okay, I'm coming out.
Barca:
Come out with him.
Okay.
Barca:
Come out with him.
Okay.
Barca:
Puckett, Puckett.
Come out with him.
Oh, my arm, my arm!
Barca:
Stop resisting!
Get on the ground!
I got handcuffs.
Barca:
I got him, I got him.
Watch out.
Once I take him off, then go.
Stand still.
I'm not going nowhere.
(Dog barking)
Barca:
Watch out, guys.
Ouch!
(Handcuffs clicking)
(Dog continues barking)
(Garbled radio transmission)
Got the last one in custody.
Ow, my arm.
(Groans)
I'm sorry.
Barca:
Good boy!
Oh, that-a-boy!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Good boy, good boy!
Diaz:
Which way you bringing him?
Barca:
Stop him for a minute.
Did you not hear me say there's a dog here, when I was looking underneath you?
When I was looking underneath the trailer at you?
I was laying down, I was halfway sleep.
Barca:
I told you, "I have a dog.
Come out or I'm gonna send him."
I don't know if you have a gun or if you're dangerous or what.
I cannot crawl in there to you.
I gave you several opportunities to come out before I sent the dog.
Come on.
Diaz:
You didn't hear him at all, right?
No.
Diaz:
But he yelled several times, "k-9 unit, k-9 unit."
I didn't hear, sir.
I'm sorry.
They're lying.
What you dreaming?
Diaz:
What?
What you mean I ruined their lives;
It wasn't my idea.
Diaz:
Okay, so...
That'swhyIwas the lookout.
Diaz:
Okay, but why would you ask them to come along, knowing that they ain't got no criminal history.
I ain't ask them to come along;
This wasn't my idea.
I said I'd be the lookout, but I ain't going in there.
And he said, "all right."
So when I looked out, that's when I the first one seen the red lights coming down this way here.
'Cause I was on the outside standing up...
And I ran.
That's why the first time, y'all only got them two, 'cause I ran.
Diaz:
No, no, no, hold up.
Stay still.
Diaz:
Stay still.
Barca:
So you understood what I said when I asked you to please come out of the-- Because I had a police dog?
Oh, no, no, no, sir.
I didn't hear you.
Is it bad?
Barca:
No.
No, you're fine.
Oh, just cuts?
Barca:
Yeah, you're fine.
Just scrapes.
Diaz:
Scrapes.
Uh, basically what we have is, uh, three gentlemen in custody for burglary to a government facility unoccupied.
Raasch:
So you got burglary charges on all three?
Diaz:
Correct, we do.
And, uh, all the property that was, uh-
- That they advised that they had taken from the classrooms, which were the, uh, projectors, all recovered.
Raasch:
All right, outstanding job.
Officer (Over radio):
132 and bush.
I've got him at gunpoint.
Dispatcher:
At gunpoint, 132 and bush.
Cover is code three.
Previously on Pioneer One.
You are holding one or more of our cosmonauts.
So you're not prepared to consider the Mars story at all.
If we maintain our position that we are holding a terror suspect, we should be okay.
We're not gonna find out what's really going on here if we send him back as a terrorist.
- And how can you make that call?
- Because I'm the one making it.
Parents.
Have you stopped to consider why they would risk sending their only child back to Earth?
- I need evidence, proof.
- They need you to star talking.
Sharing information helps, that's how science works!
Unfortunately it's not how governments work.
You can't call me here.
If I need anything else I'll call you.
It's not enough.
So what?
That's it?
I'll include it with my final report but I wouldn't get your hopes up.
Why not?
They've already decided what they believe.
All the evidence is right there.
All it takes to see it... is a little imagination.
You know, there's one thing I didn't include in the report.
Probably the best piece of evidence there is.
The boy.
Pioneer One 1x05
Is that you?
It's both of us.
I'm not using that shower again.
My foot is still killing me.
Maybe it's infected.
I put that stuff on it.
What stuff?
I don't know, whatever stuff was in there.
Don't worry, you still got the other foot.
How are you in such a good mood?
I'm barely holding on to what's left of my sanity.
It's a state of mind, my friend.
Mind over matter.
- Mind over matter?
- Yeah.
Just, I don't know, pretend you're... at summer camp.
- You ever been to summer camp?
- No.
Well, than that wouldn't work for you
No.
Wonder what that's about.
I don't know...
They never tell me anything.
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
Any twos?
Go fish.
What happened?
We caught him snooping around the perimeter.
Someone from our fan club outside?
I don't think so.
Says his name is Aleksei Chertov.
Russian I think by the sound of his accent.
He claims to know Dr. Walzer.
Really?
So he says.
Walzer's name is all over the press.
He could just be a nut.
I agree.
Let me see him.
I'm Tom Taylor.
I'd like to know what you were doing sneaking around my base.
My name is Aleksei Chertov.
I am a colleague of Dr. Walzer's.
I need to speak with him.
Who's Dr. Walzer?
I know he is here.
I saw on the news.
I'll consider it after you've given us your full cooperation.
I understand.
But first may I ask that you remove these restraints?
I am not a dangerous man.
You were caught trying to break into a military base that's under quarantine.
You're staying put for right now.
Why do you need to speak with to Walzer?
I believe I can be of assistance to him and to you.
Who says we need assistance?
I have information you will find useful.
Regarding?
The Soviet spacecraft that has returned from Mars.
Aleksei?
He's here?
So you do know him?
Yes, yes, yes I do.
He worked on the Mars program at Energia,
Russia's equivalent of JPL.
We met at a conference twelve, thirteen years ago.
He wrote the foreword to one of my books.
He says he has information on our Martian situation.
Any idea how he knows about that?
No...
Can I see him?
I haven't decided yet.
- What's the harm if he's already here?
- I haven't decided that either.
- Taylor...
- Doctor.
I understand we haven't had the best working relationship but don't talk to me like I'm stupid.
How does he know?
You're right.
I apologize.
I contacted him a few days ago to get a second opinion on some things.
But I didn't tell him what was going on.
- He figured it out on his own.
- How?
Apparently the spacecraft was transmitting telemetry and someone picked it up.
Once he heard I was here...
Did you know he was coming?
I told him not to.
Thank you for your honesty.
You ever lie to me again and your next book will be written from inside a Federal penitentiary.
Get me?
Yes.
Now can I see him?
How are you, Dave?
Not bad, yourself?
Never a dull moment.
Quite a coup your guy pulled off.
Yeah... yeah, that was a surprise.
Though the difference is semantic, really.
Please...
When's he running?
Who says he's running for something?
Okay, sure.
Fine.
The Secretary is focusing all his attention on the current situation.
Spoken like the master obfuscator you are.
I'll take that as a compliment.
What have you got for me?
- Who's that?
- I have no idea.
Aleksei.
- You sure about this?
- Nope.
I told you not to come.
Yes, I am sorry.
But the possibility of a human being returned from Mars...
I could not stay away.
I'd probably have done the same thing.
You said you had information.
Yes.
As I explained before, the capsule was sending its telemetry data and was picked up by a receiver at Baikonur.
Nobody knew what it was.
Nobody knew what it was?
No, we knew it was one of our spacecraft but no one knew anything of this mission.
- How's that possible?
- I don't know.
Many things were worked on in secret in those times but the magnitude of such an undertaking... it seems impossible.
But I did some investigation and found curious omissions in records.
Money and resources diverted and unaccounted for.
I made inquiries but no one could answer.
Well we're talking, what?
Thirty years ago?
It could be anything.
It's not uncommon for the Soviets to have mysterious omissions on the records, but of this size?
- That's very unusual.
- Could they even hide something that big?
I don't know.
Can I talk to you?
Jane says Yuri will be ready to talk when he wakes up.
I want you in there to translate if he starts up in Russian.
What about Jane?
She doesn't speak as well as you do.
And anyway, I want a second person in the room to confirm what he says.
- You don't trust her?
- It's not about trust.
I just want someone to be there who doesn't share her relationship with the kid.
What about these two?
- I don't want them left alone.
- Yeah, agreed.
Get DiLeo or Vernon to babysit, they're not doing anything anyway.
- Which one do you want?
- Flip a coin.
These people.
Do you trust them?
Yes.
But it's their show.
They've made that very clear.
Zachary.
I must know.
Do you believe?
Is it real?
I think so.
I thought you were lunch.
I've got something better.
Than lunch?
I think we have some workable intel here.
Have you ever heard of an organization called White Wolf Elite?
That's a Russian agency isn't it?
It is, but it's not part of the Russian government.
It's a private security firm.
They helped round out the force that invaded Georgia a couple years ago.
- Okay...
- It was founded by a man named Viktor Klimenko.
Ex-KGB.
Ex-KGB, now there's a nice idea.
True enough.
After '91 he was one of the first to put a claim on the collectivized oil fields and made billions.
And now he's in the army-for-hire business?
He founded White Wolf in 2000 after he became disillusioned with the direction of the new Russia.
It's now the second-largest private army in the world, second only to Blackwater.
How disillusioned was he with the new Russia?
Very.
But this is why we care.
A few years ago, White Wolf bought up surplus hardware from the Russian Space Agency.
Rockets, capsules, a whole lot of materiel.
So you're saying... our favorite Martian is a White Wolf guy?
Not necessarily.
But it's a good bet that's where the capsule came from.
Any ties to known terrorist organizations or rogue states?
No.
But they're mercenaries.
They'll sell to whoever can pay.
This Klimenko sounds like a patriot.
He wouldn't back someone if it didn't further his own interests.
So we just got to figure out what they are.
He's also a business man.
I wouldn't rule it out.
You got this from your man at CIA?
Even the Agency finds a nut every now and then.
Okay.
He says he's ready, but don't push him.
Please.
You know who I am?
Jane said you've agreed to answer some of our questions.
I feel like I should read him Miranda.
Can we start with your name?
Your name.
Yuri.
That's what we've been calling you.
Is that actually your name or are you misunderstanding me?
Name...
Yuri.
Okay.
We'll come back to that one.
Where do you come from?
Where is home?
Under a different sky.
You had a note with you.
It said you were... from Mars.
Is that where you come from?
- I don't believe you.
- Mr. Taylor...
Believe?
Is not about... believe.
What is it about?
"Home is what you carry in your heart."
You had a gun with you.
Do you understand?
A gun?
To shoot things?
Why did you have a gun?
For the wolves.
I don't understand.
- He said the gun...
- I heard what he said.
The wolves... outside.
They tell me.
Who told you?
Your parents?
Where are they?
Why...
why didn't they come with you?
Why didn't they come with you?
Mr. Taylor, please.
Why didn't your parents come with you?
Not enough... for everyone.
Goddammit!
It's like talking to a fortune cookie.
There's still time.
You really think we're going to get anything useful from him?
At least now it's clear to everyone we're not dealing with a terrorist.
It'd be a lot easier if we were.
Easier on who?
We'll try again.
Utopia Planitia?
Barren.
North Polar Cap?
Good chance for water maybe, but they'd never survive the winter
They'd have moved underground.
They would have to wherever they are.
Eos Chasma?
Good shelter from dust storms.
And solar radiation, yes, but...
Too soft and unstable for a landing here, right...
I wouldn't rule it out though.
I'm telling you, foothills of Syria Planum.
Protected, maybe buried water, it is only sensible.
I can't believe we'd miss them in Syria Planum.
That's area's been mapped down to the square meter.
We'd have seen something there by now if that's where they were.
Underground, my friend, underground.
I can't believe they'd be able to dig out an underground habitat.
Do you have any idea the weight requirements for a drill that size?
Natural caverns, the drilling could be minimal.
And you do not know what equipment they had.
You really think they could have developed a whole new generation of super-heavy-lifters without anyone knowing about it?
- Unlikely.
- Multiple launches... with smaller boosters.
- Yeah...
- Making use of existing technology
- is the only viable way...
- I have read your books!
- Then you know I'm right!
- Of course I do.
- Then why are we arguing?
- Who's arguing, Zachary?
You can be a real sonofabitch sometimes, you know that?
Yes, this I know too.
You'll have to forgive us, Mr. Vernon.
My father is Mr. Vernon.
Call me Glenn.
It must sound to you like we speak another language.
What are you doing exactly?
Well, this is water... taken from inside the capsule.
This gas chromatograph will show us the deuterium hydrogen ratio to determine whether or not it has come from Mars.
We've known since the 70s that the D to H ratio on Mars is different from Earth's.
Mars has a completely different chemical history.
And, hopefully, this... herovina will demonstrate this.
If it's not contaminated.
Yeah, but, as you say... is worth a shot.
And if we can prove that this water came from Mars...
Then maintaining life on the surface would be possible.
More than possible.
Where there's water... there is potential for life.
It would certainly change the game.
There's even some evidence that water still flows on the surface during the summer season.
Speaking of water flowing.
Nature calls, gentlemen.
Zachary.
The boy.
- Yuri?
- Yeah, have you spoken with him?
He's only just started talking.
What is he like?
Small.
Frightened.
Of course.
The ordeal!
Can you imagine?
I have.
Many times.
When can I see him?
I don't know if that's possible, Aleksei.
You didn't make a very good impression showing up the way you did.
But I am here now.
What harm can I do?
That's not how these people think.
I'll talk to Taylor.
Absolutely not.
- I know it was a mistake.
- You think?
I'm sorry if it made things inconvenient for you
Inconvenient?
I don't think you understand that word.
I realize the position I put you in.
I don't think you do.
This thing is so much bigger than what you think.
No, it's bigger than you think.
Please, I have had it up to here with your bullshit.
Maybe you wouldn't have such a huge chip on your shoulder if you learned how to work with people instead of talking down to them all the time.
- You're right.
- Don't forget that I'm the one who brought you here in the first place and that I'm the one that... what did you say?
You're right.
Is this a reverse psychology thing?
Why do you think I'm not still married?
Did you talk to Yuri?
- Yes.
- What did he say?
Nothing very useful.
But I think you might be right about the parents.
Why they sent him alone.
Let me talk to him.
I spent time with him, I think I can engage him.
There are only four days left in the quarantine... and who knows what happens to Yuri then.
We don't have a lot of time.
What is there to lose?
I'm sorry it's taken so long to meet in person, Minister.
Please, no need to stand on ceremony.
Call me Pierre.
Pierre.
And before we begin, I believe congratulations are in order.
Congratulations?
For...?
Your promotion.
Oh, yes... thank you.
And I wanted to thank you and the Prime Minister for your patience with us during all this.
The press hasn't been so kind to you.
Please.
The next week they'll have forgotten the whole thing.
Probably.
Anyhow...
Did you get a chance to look over those documents we sent you?
It's fascinating reading... but I'm afraid I don't see the relevance.
Don't see the relevance?
It's relevant because there's a likely connection between this White Wolf...
- and the downed capsule.
- Supposition.
It's the best lead we've had.
We need to follow up on it.
It's a tenuous connection at best.
Almost two weeks of investigation... has revealed no evidence of foul play.
The Russians have given us their full cooperation.
This White Wolf is a private entity.
If they were conducting an operation or doing so on behalf of somebody else, do you honestly believe the Russians would admit to it?
There is no reason not to take them at their word.
At their word?
That this guy is some long-lost cosmonaut from outer space?
This space nonsense was your pretense for this whole quarantine.
But that doesn't matter right now.
You can investigate whatever you like of course.
But the Russians have requested the return of their man at the end of the quarantine and we intend to turn him over.
Unacceptable.
He's our only link to whoever's behind this.
And we're not giving him up.
Make no mistake.
My visit is a courtesy.
Call the White House.
This quarantine is over.
Come, my friend.
You are about to witness one of the most important discoveries in all of history.
He's not kidding.
What are you looking for?
Elevated levels of deuterium.
Heavy hydrogen.
Any moment now...
What?
Inconclusive.
It was a long shot.
So the water's not from Mars?
It still could be.
But we just can't tell for sure.
At least not with the equipment you have here.
Have you checked inside the reentry capsule for traces of regolith?
The pressure suit was covered in dirt but it was contaminated at the crash site.
Doctor Walzer.
They're ready for you.
Hello Yuri.
Remember me?
Yes.
How are you feeling?
I'm dead... here.
I'm sorry.
They're...
We're doing everything we can.
Ask questions.
There was water... in your capsule,
How did you find your water?
From the pit.
The pit?
Everything...
- from the Pit.
- You mean...
From the ground?
From under the ground?
Water under the ground?
It lives... in the pit.
Lives?
What lives?
Was there life there?
Water... brings life.
How did you live... on the surface?
Inside?
Inside under the ground?
Live... inside.
Always inside.
Outside is danger.
Yes.
Outside is dangerous.
Did... did you come here on purpose?
To this place?
Did...
Did you crash here on purpose... or by accident?
- Accident.
- By accident.
It didn't separate.
Yes, yes, that's right, the capsule didn't separate, the whole thing came down.
He had to choose.
Choose?
What did you have to choose?
What did you choose?
Choose how to live.
I don't understand, what...
what does that mean?
I don't understand what you mean.
Yuri.
Explain to me what you mean.
Yuri.
Something's wrong.
For years, years, I have said that radiation is the primary danger.
You were saying it's acceptable risk.
Do you see now?
There are ways to mitigate the effects of radiation on the surface.
This doesn't that mean living there longterm is impossible.
And what of solar flares in transit?
You are always talking go go go.
Look what happens.
I didn't send him there Aleksei.
He's dying.
What does it matter now?
Do they know when we'll be able to talk again?
Give us the room, please.
Before we went in there I was on the phone with McClellan.
He's ending the quarantine early.
- When?
- Tomorrow morning.
The Canadians want to turn Yuri over when the clock runs out but McClellan doesn't want that to happen.
Tonight we're going to load him onto a truck and slip out of here as quietly as possible.
Assuming he lives that long.
Has this been sanctioned?
He says it comes direct from the White House.
Well, that's it then.
That's it.
What do you need me to do?
Figure out who needs to know, get them up to speed.
Don't let Benton get wind of anything.
Don't worry.
I know how to handle Benton.
Thank you Sophie.
Those things'll kill you you know.
Thanks for the tip.
I'll never understand why people still do that.
The science has been around for fifty years... people don't listen.
Science isn't everything, doctor.
You don't believe smoking will kill you?
No, I'm saying that dying isn't necessarily the worst thing that can happen to somebody.
Tell that to that kid in there.
Did you want something?
I... guess I wanted to thank you.
For allowing me to see this.
I'm not gonna be able to tell anybody, am I?
Probably not, no.
It's not really fair, is it?
He comes all this way... beating appropriately astronomical odds...
The kid could have been telling you exactly what you wanted to hear in there,
Did you consider that?
You saw him in that bed.
I did.
What possible reason could he have to lie?
I don't know.
You look me in the eye and you tell me right now that you don't believe he's really from Mars.
I thought I might find you here.
Here I am.
I...
I know you were being close with him.
I'm sorry.
It's okay, I'm fine.
I don't really know what I'm trying to say, but I'm...
I'm sorry.
I work with cancer patients.
I know how this goes.
I'm really fine.
Alright...
Do you know what they're going to do with him?
No.
No they never tell me anything until it's about to happen.
I'm going to stay with him though.
For as long as they'll let me.
DiLeo...
Something's up.
I think she likes you.
Yeah...
Okay, you all know by know that the quarantine is ending tomorrow.
But I've made a decision and I thought all of you should know.
Tomorrow morning, we're going to hold a press conference, and at that press conference...
we're gonna to tell the world what's really been going on here the last two weeks.
What are we telling them, exactly?
That we have evidence that the Soviet Union may have sent people to Mars in the 1980s, and that we have recovered one of those people.
We're going to lay out everything we know and let the world decide for themselves.
Vernon, I need you to call all your contacts, call everyone you know, get as many people in here tomorrow morning as possible.
DiLeo, I need you to work with Dr. Walzer on language for a statement.
Can we have the room, please?
- No!
- Sophie...
- Tom, no!
- I've made up my mind.
You can't do this.
Your career will be over.
- If I had a nickel for every time I've...
- No kidding!
You can't do this!
We have instructions from the White House.
McClellan's scaring them into this.
Really?
Were you in the room for that meeting were you?
You know what's going on here.
It's politics they don't want to look weak in an election year.
Are you really going to get up there in front of the whole world and tell them that we have a real live Martian in here?
I'm going to tell them what we know.
From there it's out of our hands.
Look.
I know... you've been... frustrated.
But this is a mistake.
I'm telling you you are making a mistake.
I don't think so.
You must be happy.
Happy?
Happy's not the word.
Tomorrow everything changes.
You think so?
For better or for worse.
I'll be with you in a second.
I'm in the mess.
There are events that become pivot points in history.
We had no idea what was going to happen.
And we had no idea the price we'd pay.
We just did what we thought was right at the time.
And I would do it all again.
Even knowing the consequences.

POP, PLEASE.
NOT WHILE WE'RE EATING.
(TV TURNS OFF)
THANK YOU.
SO THE LAKERS ARE LOOKING GOOD THIS YEAR, HUH?
I THINK KOBE'S GONNA TAKE IT ALL THE WAY.
I HAVE NO APPETITE.
MOM WOULD WANT YOU TO EAT.
HAPPY NOW?
I'M WALKING ON SUNSHINE.
THINK YOU MIGHT GO OUT TODAY?
MAYBE CHANGE IN TO SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T SCREAM JOHNNY CASH.
YOUR MOTHER LOVED JOHNNY CASH.
SHE LOVED ALL MUSIC,
ESPECIALLY AMERICAN IDOL.
NOBODY VOTED MORE THAN YOUR MOTHER.
NOBODY.
SHE WAS CRUSHED WHEN THE JESUS FREAK BEAT OUT THE FAGELA.
(GRUNTS) DAD...
WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT USING THAT WORD?
HERE WE GO.
I CAN'T TALK IN MY OWN HOME?
IT'S MY HOME TOO.
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST SAY "GAY?"
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ALL GAY.
YOUR COUSIN MARVIN'S A FAGELA
AND I'VE NEVER ONCE SEEN HIM SMILE.
OK.
ENOUGH WITH THE HOMOPHOBIA.
YOU'RE SO MISERABLE HERE.
GO.
I WISH.
BUT I PROMISED MOM I WOULD STAY HERE AND TAKE CARE OF YOU.
I SHOULD GO LIVE WITH YOUR BROTHER.
HE TREATS ME LIKE A KING.
WELL, THE SOONER THE BETTER, YOUR MAJESTY.
I'M SORRY, POP.
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I COULD DO FOR YOU TODAY?
YEAH.
YOU COULD KILL ME.
BUT THEN WHO WOULD TORTURE ME?
MAN ON TV: ...
MOUTH WATERING PORK LOIN ROAST.
NINE JUICY 1/4 POUND HAMBURGERS.
FOUR BIG, HEALTHY SALMON STEAKS.
("HELLO DARLING" BY PIERRE DE REEDER PLAYS)
(SIGHS)
WOMAN THROUGH SPEAKERS:
DESIRE RAGED IN EVERY PORE OF HIS BODY.
A FLASH OF HEAT POUNDED HIS LOINS.
FOR SHE WAS A SIREN.
HE MARVELED AT THE SUPPLE ARCH OF HER BEAUTIFUL BACK,
HER TINY WASTE TAPERING TO A HEART-SHAPED DERNIER.
HE CROUCHED IN FRONT OF HER SEATED FORM.
CHAPTER THREE.
"LET ME LOVE YOU," HE WHISPERED.
SHE WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO RESIST THIS.
"NOTHING ON EARTH CAN QUELL THE FLAMES OF MY HEART."
DESIRE AND SHINE...
OH, MY GOD!
IT IS MY DREAM WEDDING DRESS.
WAIT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT HAS NO BEADING.
AND I LOVE BEADING.
FORGET IT.
THIS SUCKS.
ALLEN, CHILL.
WE'RE PREPARED FOR THIS.
YOU GOT A PRENUP.
MOLLY, IS DEB IN?
YES, MR. DORFMAN.
(TYPING)
HEY, DEB, I'M OUT OF HERE AFTER LUNCH TODAY.
GOT TO GO SCHMOOZE WILLIAMS.
YOU FINISH HIS NUMBERS?
-YEAH.
-I NEED YOU TO PULL UP ALLEN KLEIN'S PRENUP.
AND I NEED THE TAX ANALYSIS FOR THE LINEAR CITY AUDIT BY WEDNESDAY.
UH...
DONE AND DONE.
AND ABOUT MY RAISE, YOU SAID THAT YOU WOULD SLEEP ON IT
A MONTH AGO.
I'M GIVING YOU SOMETHING BETTER--
A NEW 17.3-INCH LAPTOP.
I'LL SEE YOU SUNDAY, DEB.
YOU'RE MY ROCK!
-YOU'RE MY ROLL.
-ROCK AND ROLL!
SO I SAID TO MYSELF, "LEEANN, LISTEN TO YOUR LIFE COACH
AND ANSWER THE QUESTION.
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO BE HAPPY?"
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I ANSWERED?
A RALPH LAUREN MENORAH?
DON'T MAKE FUN OF MY MENORAH COLLECTION.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO TO CONVERSION CLASS
AND HONOR THE TRADITIONS OF OUR HEBREW PEOPLE.
SORRY.
OK.
SO WHAT IS IT THAT YOU NEED TO BE HAPPY?
I NEED A BABY.
BUT YOU HAVE A BABY, NAMED DANIEL.
HEH.
BOOM.
UHH...
YOU DON'T FOOL ME, DEB.
YOU JUST CRACK JOKES TO HIDE YOUR TRUE FEELINGS.
WELL, 'CAUSE NOBODY WANTS TO LISTEN.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
WE'RE HERE FOR YOU.
WELL...
OK.
YOU KNOW, LEEANN,
THE TRUTH IS I'VE REALLY BEEN MISSING MY MOM LATELY.
DEB, THE PAST IS THE PAST.
LET'S FOCUS ON THE FUTURE.
OUR CLOCKS ARE TICKING.
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
OUR BOOBS ARE GOING TO BE SAGGING
AND OUR FACES WILL LOOK LIKE OLD PRUNES.
WOW.
NOT JUST PRUNES.
OLD PRUNES.
YEAH.
DON'T SURRENDER, DEB.
GET IN THE GAME AND FIGHT.
ASK THE QUESTION.
DON'T BE AFRAID.
OK.
SO WHAT DO I NEED TO BE HAPPY?
WELL...
I NEED TO KNOW WHY THIS TABLE IS SET FOR FIVE.
OH, NO.
LEEANN, NO.
NO, NO.
NOT AGAIN.
DEB, YOU NEED SOMEONE TO LOVE.
AND YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE HUGH.
NOW HOPEFULLY, SOMETHING IN MY CLOSET WILL FIT YOU.
COME.
WELL, IT WAS ALMOST A DISASTER.
BUT I FINALLY CLOSED OUT MY PIED-A-TERRE ON PARK AVENUE.
GREAT.
DO YOU STILL HAVE A CONDO ON CABO?
AH, GOD NO.
I FLIPPED THAT FOR A RANCH IN TELLURIDE.

NOPE.

WOW.

SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WALK ME TO THE METRO?
SUCK IT UP, DEBORAH.
YOU JUST NEED TO BE YOUR BADASS SELF DOWN HERE.
WATCH.
NOW YOU.
-YOU BAD?
-(SCOFFS) YO MAMA.
YEAH!
NICE.
(SPEAKING ARABIC)
GIVING THOSE TO YOUR HOT CHA-CHA GIRLFRIEND?
SHE'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.
THESE ARE FOR ME.
BE GOOD TO YOURSELF, DEBORAH.
BYE.
I'LL GIVE YOU FIVE BUCKS TO WALK ME TO THE METRO.
HE GAVE ME 20 NOT TO.
GREAT.
HOW MUCH ARE THOSE?
HELLO.
HOW ARE YOU?
OH, MY GOD.
THEY HAVE RED VELVET WEDDING CAKE.
WHAT?
HEY, MOLLY.
I NEED A MAKE UP GIFT FOR LEEANN.

SHE'S DYING FOR THE DURA ROSE GOLD PARISIAN.
GET A GRIP.
THAT'S WAY OVERKILL.
-MORNING.
-CAN I HAVE THOSE?
DRIVE THESE OVER TO MY HOUSE ON YOUR LUNCH BREAK
WITH A CARD SAYING, "I LOVE YOU, BABE."
-UNH.
-OH, I KNOW.
I GOT SLURPEED BY THE CUTEST TWO-YEAR-OLD SOCIOPATH.
OH, LEEANN PREGNANT YET?
-WELL, SHE'S-- (PHONE RINGS)
OH, I GOT A CALL.
HEY, IT'S ALLEN.
HEY, ALLEN.
OH, I HEAR YOU, BUDDY.
WE'LL DO THE FRONT NINE THIS TIME.
OH, HEY, REALLY BIG FAVOR.
MY BRIDAL SHOWER IS THIS FRIDAY.
AND I STILL DON'T HAVE A MAID OF HONOR.
ALL MY FRIENDS ARE MARRIED AND HAPPY AND LA LA.
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE THE ONLY SINGLE GIRL I KNOW.
SO...
IT'S AN INSULT AND AN HONOR.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
YOU--I WOULD TOTALLY HUG YOU,
BUT YOU ARE REALLY GROSS RIGHT NOW.
SO, UNH.
OK.
I HAVE A CLEAN SHIRT IN MY GYM BAG IF...
-OK.
-IT'S REALLY CUTE TOO.
THANKS.
HARD AT WORK?
UH, YEAH.
WHAT'S UP?
WELL, I JUST WANTED TO INTRODUCE YOU TO OUR TWO NEW CLIENTS.
THIS IS CHELSEA AND VRONKA.
THIS IS MY BROTHER DANIEL.
YOU DIDN'T TELL US YOU HAD A HOT BROTHER.
WHO HAS HOT SHOT OFFICE IN BORING SUBURB?
WELCOME TO THE AGENCY.
HOW ABOUT I TAKE YOU TWO TO LUNCH AND EXPLAIN WHAT I'M GOING TO DO FOR YOU?
NO NEED, DANNY.
WE WANT DEB TO BE OUR ACCOUNTANT.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE DEB OUT FOR BIG, GLORIOUS CELEBRATION FOR SAVING US BIG BUCKS.
APPLEBEE'S?
DO THEY NOT HAVE SPEED LIMITS IN POLAND?
WE PARTY DOWN THERE.
OH, NO, NO, NO.
I TAKE ONE TOKE OF THAT,
AND I GAIN BACK ALL THE WEIGHT I'VE LOST.
AND FRANKLY MY SELF ESTEEM IS QUESTIONABLE AS IS.
NO SELF ESTEEM?
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE NEEDS, VRONKA?
I DO.
DEB:
OK.
SO WHERE ARE YOU GUYS TAKING ME?
IT'S CLICHE.
UGLY DUCKLING INTO BEAUTIFUL SWAN MAKEOVER.
OH, I'M OK THE WAY I AM.
OH, IS THAT REALLY WORKING FOR YOU?
JUST BEING JAY'S CAT SITTER?
YOU'RE SO INTO THE BOY.
COME ON, DEB.
CONFESS.
YES, I'M INTO HIM.
AND HE FINALLY KISSED ME.
WELL, HE KISSED ME ONCE BEFORE.
BUT IT WAS AT MY BROTHER'S WEDDING.
AND IT DOESN'T COUNT BECAUSE HE WAS DRUNK,
AND HE PUKED RIGHT AFTERWARDS.
BUT ANYWAY, THE POINT IS I'VE GOT FOUR DAYS
TO FIX UP HIS LOFT.
AND THEN--
THEN WHAT?
YOU LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER?
GET REAL, CINDERELLA.
YOU MIGHT BE A BOMB ACCOUNTANT,
BUT WE KNOW MEN.
GIVE THE LOFT AND YOU A MAKEOVER.
AND IN THE CONQUEST FOR JAY WILL BE ASSURED.
BUT I--I DON'T WANT TO LOOK LIKE A HOOKER.
I HEARD THAT, DEB.
I KNOW.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
DEB?
HI.
WHAT?
ARE YOU TRYING TO PICK UP SAILORS?
NO, POP!
HELLO.
I GOT A MAKEOVER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
PRETTY HOT, RIGHT?
TEPID?
ALL RIGHT, I KNOW.
IT'S A BIT MUCH.
I MEAN, IT'S NOT REALLY ME.
BUT YOU KNOW, I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHO ME IS YET.
I'M STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS.
YOU GOT SUITCASES-- WALKING IN--WHY--WHY--
WHY DOES HE HAVE A SUITCASE?
BECAUSE POP MISSED YOU.
HEY, NOW I GOT TO GO.
LEEANN IS IN A BABYMAKING WINDOW.
OH, NO, NO, NO.
YOU ARE NOT JUST DROPPING POP HERE.
WHAT THE HELL KIND OF PLACE IS THIS?
PIPES EVERYWHERE?
NO WALLS.
NO CARPETING.
IT'S MODERN, POP.
WELL, IS THERE A BATHROOM?
OR AM I SUPPOSED TO TAKE
A MODERN PISS RIGHT HERE ON CEMENT FLOOR?
YES, THERE'S A TOILET.
GO TO THE RIGHT.
UNH.
GOD.
YOU COULDN'T JUST WAIT 'TIL SATURDAY?
I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU, OK?
HOW ABOUT A BRAND NEW WIRELESS OFFICEJET PRINTER?
NO.
WITH A NEW 20-INCH LCD MONITOR?
-NO.
-WITH A NEW--
-WHAT DO YOU WANT?
-I WANT MY RAISE.
I DESERVE THAT RAISE, DANIEL.
SO $200 MORE A WEEK
OR POP GOES HOME WITH YOU.
THEY GIVE YOU A PAIR OF CAJONES WITH THIS MAKEOVER?
NO.
BUT I DID GIVE THE AGENCY A PAIR OF MODELS.
(TOILET FLUSHES)
-SO DEAL?
OR DO YOU WANT TO JUST TAKE POP?
POP:
YOUR MODERN TOILET JUST BLOW DRIED MY TOOKUS.
DEAL.
JUST GAVE DEB A RAISE, POP.
POP:
IS YOUR BROTHER THE GREATEST OR WHAT?
THE GREATEST.
NOW I GOT TO GO.
STILL MY ROCK?
ROCK WITH A RAISE.
ROLL.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER, POP.
OK?
POP:
THE TV IS BROKEN.
GOD THERE ISN'T EVEN A TV.
THERE IS A TV.
IT'S UPSTAIRS WHERE YOU'LL BE SLEEPING COMFORTABLY.
INSTEAD OF ME.
WHAT'S WITH THE VERKAKTE STAIRCASE.
HEY, BABY, I'M ON MY WAY.
HURRY!
THIS IS THE LAST NIGHT I'M OVULATING.
THE WINDOW IS CLOSING.
I REPEAT, THE WINDOW IS CLOSING.
LOOK WHO'S HERE.
JEWISH BROTHER DANIEL.
YOU PARTY WITH US NOW.
I CAN'T.
I'M MARRIED.
WHO PAYS TO COOK THEIR OWN FOOD
AND EAT WITH STRANGERS?
TRY THE SAKI.
HOT WINE?
I TELL YOU,
THE JAPANESE COULD SELL ANYTHING.
GOD, COULD YOU BE MORE OFFENSIVE?
SINCE WHEN DO YOU EAT JAPANESE?
SINCE I'M TRYING NEW THINGS.
OK?
I LIKE IT HERE.
IT'S CUTE, POP.
COME ON, LOOK AT THE LAMPS.
THEY'RE LIKE LITTLE SCULPTURES.
THEY'RE MADE OUT OF PAPER.
THEY COST NOTHING.
I'LL BET THEY INVENTED BOTTLED WATER TOO.
GOD...
PLEASE TRY TO BE MORE OPEN.
PLEASE TRY THE SAKI.
NOBODY LOVED WINE MORE THAN YOUR MOTHER.
NOTHING FANCY OR HEATED.
SHE'D BE HAPPY YOUR BROTHER GAVE YOU A RAISE.
HEY, MAYBE ONE DAY I'LL WORK MY WAY UP TO BEING DAN'S PARTNER.
I'D RATHER SEE YOU WITH A HUSBAND AND KIDS.
YOU KNOW, NOT EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET MARRIED, POP.
NOT EVERYBODY WANTS TO STOP EVERYTHING AND HAVE KIDS.
HERE WE GO.
I CAN'T TALK TO YOU.
I'LL JUST SIT HERE AND DRINK OVERPRICE, HEATED WINE.
SORRY.
WHAT THEY HELL ARE YOU LOOKING AT?
(WHISPERS) TURN AROUND.
TURN AROUND.
JUST STOP.
GOD, WHY DOES EVERYTHING HAVE TO BE SO HARD?
WHY DO I ALWAYS HAVE TO YELL AT YOU TO EAT?
PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, TRY THIS.
IT'S DELICIOUS.
HAPPY NOW?
DANCING ON THE CEILING.
-TASTES GOOD.
-GOOD.
BUT I WOULDN'T MIND A SANDWICH.
YOU SURE IT'S SAFE?
YEAH, IT'S JUST THE CITY, POP.
WHO'S THAT?
THE MAYOR?
LOOK.
OK.
YOU CAN'T SHOW ANY FEAR DOWN HERE.
RIGHT?
YOU JUST HAVE TO ASSUME BADASS ATTITUDE.
LET'S HOPE THEY DON'T SEE THE URINE RUNNING DOWN MY LEG.
ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE ALMOST HOME.
HOME HAS A KITCHEN THAT'S NOT IN THE LIVING ROOM.
YOU CAN SURVIVE FOUR MORE DAYS.
I CAN'T SURVIVE FOR FOUR MORE SECONDS.
MOVE!
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WALKING DOWN HERE, DO YOU HEAR ME?
YES, ADMITTEDLY, IT IS A LITTLE BIT SCARY.
BUT, HEY, MAYBE A LITTLE SCARY IS GOOD FOR US, RIGHT?

HAVE NO FILTER.
YOU'RE JUST BEING HONEST.

HMM.
SATISFY JAY'S SWEET TOOTH.
SHE SEEMS FRIENDLY.
I KNOW HER.
SHOCKING.
IN THE BIBLICAL SENSE, I PRESUME.
WHAT IS WITH YOU AND THIS, LIKE, REVOLVING DOOR OF HOTTIES?
YOU EVER HAD SERIOUS GIRLFRIEND?
ONCE.
IT'S NOT FOR ME.
HEARTBREAK?
(WOMAN SPEAKING SPANISH)
COME ON.
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU, VERY, VERY GOOD.
OK.
(WOMAN SPEAKING SPANISH)
I HAVE SOMETHING VERY GOOD FOR YOU TODAY ONLY.
HUH?
FOR YOUR HUSBAND.
-BIG CUCHARA.
-OH.
IF I HAD A HUSBAND, HE WOULD DEFINITELY WANT A BIG CUCHARA.
BUT I DON'T.
SO...
-AHH.
-NO HUSBAND.
-SORRY.
-THAT'S OK.
I COULD BUY SOMETHING FOR MY DAD.
VERY GOOD.
TODAY ONLY.
A DOZEN OF RED SOCKS FOR 1.99.
OH, THAT'S A GOOD DEAL.
BUT HE DOESN'T WEAR RED.
HE ONLY WEARS BLACK.
HE'S A WIDOWER.
AH, LIFE IS HARD AND SHORT LIKE ME.
BUT TODAY ONLY, SENORITA, 5.99.
-BEAUTIFUL, HUH?
-OH, YEAH.
BUY TWO GET ONE FREE.
AND I THROW IN THE SOCKS.
OK.
DEAL.
SOLD.
ALL RIGHT!
WHOO!
VERY GOOD.
OK.
HEY, COOKIE.
DON'T SAY I NEVER GOT YOU ANYTHING.
DON'T MAKE FUN OF THE COLOR.
IT'S MY NEW FAVORITE.

AHEM.
HERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU.
WE SHOULD GO.
I GOT TO GET TO WORK.
-GRACIAS.
ADIOS.
-ADIOS, HANDSOME.
(SPEAKS SPANISH) BIG CUCHARA ONLY 5.99!
(SPEAKS SPANISH)
SO YOU'RE INTO OLDER MEN?
WHAT?
SHABU-SHABU LAST NIGHT.
(SNORTS) IT WAS MY DAD.
YOU'RE CLOSE TO YOUR FOLKS?
NOT REALLY.
I MEAN, IT'S JUST MY DAD NOW ANYWAY.
'CAUSE MY MOM DAD LAST YEAR.
OH, GOD.
I'M SO SORRY.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
ARE YOU CLOSE TO YOUR FOLKS?
YEAH.
VERY COOL PEOPLE.
THEY REALLY GET ME.
WOW.
BOTH OF THEM, HUH?
-YEAH.
-LUCKY.
IT'S WONDERFUL.
MY MOM WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO EVER GOT ME.
I MEAN, NOT THAT SHE THOUGHT I WAS PERFECT.
SHE WAS ALWAYS ON ME ABOUT EVERYTHING--MY HAIR, MY WEIGHT.
SHE'D BE LIKE, "YOU'LL NEVER GET A MAN, DEBORAH.
GET MARRIED, THEN YOU CAN GET FAT."
I USED TO HATE IT WHEN SHE WOULD NUDGE ME.
BUT NOW IT'S LIKE...
I EVEN MISS THAT.
I MISS EVERYTHING.
OH.
SORRY.
SORRY.
DEBORAH, STOP APOLOGIZING FOR BEING YOU.
I DO THAT.
YOU SAY "I'M SORRY" LIKE EVERY FIVE MINUTES.
OH...
SORRY.
HEH.
SEE.
YEAH.
-GOT IT.
(PHONE RINGS)
OH.
HI, DANIEL.
I'M SORRY.
OH, SORRY.
I'M GOING CRAZY.
I NEED TO SEE YOU NOW.
ARE YOU OK?
DO YOU WANT TO COME TO THE LOFT?
NO, NO, NO.
POP CAN'T KNOW.
OK.
MEET ME AT PERSHING SQUARE BY THE FOUNTAIN.
THANKS, DEB.
(PHONE RINGS)
DANIEL, WHERE ARE YOU?
JAY:
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO THIS.
-JAY.
-THEY SAID "KABUL" SO I JUMPED.
I MEAN, EVEN KATIE COURIC WAS EMBEDDED WITH THE TROOPS HERE.
BUT NOT ME.
-OK.
YOU JUST NEED TO--
-LISTEN--
I AM COVERING A WIDOWS-ONLY WEAVING BUSINESS
THAT ROSE FROM THE RUBBLE.
THEY'RE TEACHING ME HOW TO MAKE SCARVES.
I THINK THAT SOUNDS COOL.
I HANG OUT IN JUNGLES.
I INTERVIEW DRUG CZARS.
I WATERBOARD MYSELF.
I DON'T WEAVE.
JAY, OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE THE BEST REPORTER THAT THEY HAVE.
SO YOU GET IN THERE.
AND YOU WEAVE WITH THOSE WIDOWS
AND SHOW US HOW THEY'RE NOT ONLY SURVIVING
BUT THEY'RE THRIVING IN THAT WORLD.
DEB, WHAT WOULD I DO WITHOUT YOU?
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
I OWE YOU ANOTHER DINNER.
SATURDAY NIGHT.
YOU AND ME.
AND, OH, ARE WE GONNA PARTY.
HEY, WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE COLOR?
I DON'T HAVE ONE.
WHY?
NO REASON.
I MEAN, IT'S A SURPRISE.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, I'LL SEE YOU SATURDAY.
BYE.
(CLOSES PHONE)
-CHANGE!
-OH!
-GOD!
-CHANGE!
ASK NICELY.
YOU'RE SCARING PEOPLE.
CHANGE?
-HEY.
-HEY.
-WHAT'S GOING ON?
-I PARTIED LAST NIGHT.
WELL, GOOD.
YOU KNOW, YOU AND LEEANN COULD USE A LITTLE FUN.
ME AND VRONKA AND CHELSEA.
OH...
GOD, DANIEL!
HOW COULD YOU?
DOES LEEANN KNOW?
NO.
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
I TOLD HER THAT YOU HAVE A BIG PROBLEM.
SO I TOOK YOU OUT DRINKING ALL NIGHT.
THAT'S AWESOME.
WHAT'S MY BIG PROBLEM?
YOU'RE A SEX ADDICT?
I'M A SEX ADDICT?
!
DON'T WORRY.
BECAUSE I TOLD LEEANN
THAT I CONVINCED YOU TO GO TO THE 12-STEP MEETINGS.
OH, HOW WONDERFUL OF YOU!
NOW, LEEANN'S GOING TO CALL YOU.
OK?
SO I NEED YOU BACK ME.
-NO WAY.
NO WAY.
-DEB.
YOU CROSSED THE LINE THIS TIME, DANIEL.
I MEAN IT.
DEB, PLEASE, I SWEAR I'VE NEVER CHEATED BEFORE.
AND I WILL NEVER, EVER CHEAT AGAIN.
I DON'T WANT ANY PART OF THIS.
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.

(PHONE RINGS)
IT'S LEEANN.
I CAN'T BREATHE.
HEY, LEEANN.
YEAH.
NO, NO, NO.
HE--WE-- YES, HE WAS WITH ME LAST NIGHT.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
HE TOLD YOU I HAVE A SECRET LIFE AS A FLUFFER IN CHATSWORTH?
WHAT DID YOU GET?
WHAT DID YOU BUY?
POP:
KOBE BRYANT SHOOTS AND SCORES.
AND THE LAKERS WIN IN OVERTIME.
BOY, DID YOU MISS A GREAT GAME.
AND FOR WHAT?
TO PAINT A WALL?
WE'RE NOT PEOPLE WHO PAINT WALLS.
WE HIRE PAINTERS TO PAINT WALLS.
IT'S FUN, POP.
YOU WANT TO GRAB A BRUSH, JUMP IN?
WHEN HELL FREEZES OVER, WHICH IS POSSIBLE NOW WITH GLOBAL WARMING.
YOU KNOW, JAY DID A GREAT VLOG ON THAT.
WHICH ONE OF THESE DO YOU THINK MATCHES HIS EYES?
I CALLED DANIEL TO THANK HIM FOR THE LAKER TICKET.
BUT HE HASN'T CALLED ME BACK?
HE'S SWAMPED RIGHT NOW.
HE WORKS TOO HARD.
OH!
LOOK, POP.
I GOT YOU A PRESENT TODAY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
DO I LOOK LIKE TOMMY BAHAMA?
GET ME A PAIR OF MARACAS.
I'LL JOIN THE BEACH BOYS.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
IT'S THE KEY TO MY HEART, BABE.
-IT'S FOR PUTTING UP WITH POP.
-IT'S BEAUTIFUL, BABE.
THE DURA ROSE GOLD PARISIAN IS OUT OF REACH NOW.
BUT WE'LL GET THERE.
(SIGHS) LET'S SEE.
I THINK IF WE HAVE A BOY WE SHOULD NAME HIM DAVID.
DAVID DORFMAN.
OR BONO.
BONO DORFMAN.
DAVID BONO DORFMAN.
-LET'S--
-LET'S GO TO VEGAS.
-VEGAS?
-THERE'S NO WORK ON FRIDAY.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO VEGAS.
WE'RE BOOKED ALL WEEKEND.
-WE'VE GOT PLANS.
-I'M SICK OF PLANS.
WHY CAN'T WE HAVE SOME FUN FOR A CHANGE?
FUN?
YOU SEEMED LIKE YOU WERE HAVING FUN FIVE MINUTES AGO.
BUT THEN YOU HAD TO SPOIL IT WITH ALL THE BABY TALK.
IT'S BONO BY THE WAY.
AND THERE ARE NO JEWISH BONOS, LEEANN.
WELL, THERE'S NO JEWISH PIRATES EITHER, CAPTAIN JACK.
JUST ADMIT IT.
YOU DON'T WANT THIS BABY.
MAYBE I DON'T.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
IT'S OPEN.
OH, MY HERO.
(DRILL RUNS)
-I'M READY TO HANG ART.
-I SEE THAT.
YOU HAVE A GOOD EYE.
YOU THINK I HAVE A GOOD EYE?
WELL, THE OTHER ONE SUCKS.
BUT...
HEH HEH.
COOL.
YOU'RE PAINTING A WALL.
I'VE CREATED A MONSTER.
WELL, I THOUGHT I WOULD PAINT IT JAY'S FAVORITE COLOR.
BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE ONE.
SO I AM PAINTING IT TO MATCH HIS EYES.
THOUGHTFUL.
THAT'S THE KIND OF GIRL I AM.
SO ARE YOU FREE TO HELP ME MOVE SOME FURNITURE,
OR DO YOU HAVE A DATE?
YOU PROBABLY HAVE A DATE.
BUT WHO WOULD YOU DATE?
BECAUSE YOU'VE DATED EVERYBODY.
SHUT UP AND POINT.
(DRILL RUNS)
LET'S GO.
DON'T DRILL THE FURNITURE.
LET'S JUST MOVE IT.
OH, I'LL SEE.
("LET'S SPEND SOME TIME" PLAYS)
CAN I HELP YOU?
NO, I'M FINE.

WHAT ARE YOU GROWING?
AIR CONDITIONING UNITS?
NOT A FAN OF URBAN WHIMSY, HUH?
NOT A FAN OF URBAN ANYTHING.
MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME.
THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT I HAVE TO GET.
MY DAUGHTER AND HER VERKAKTE LISTS.
SUDDENLY SHE'S A REGULAR MARTHA STEWART WITHOUT A PRISON RECORD.
WELL, I'VE GOT TO PICK UP SOME ART SUPPLIES.
GIVE ME A MINUTE.
WE'LL TAKE MY TRUCK.
EITHER YOU'RE A FAGELA WHO WANTS MY BODY OR A MENSCH.
TRANSLATION?
GAY OR A GOOD PERSON.
COULDN'T I BE BOTH?
-MORNING.
-HEY.
WHOA.
EITHER I'M HALLUCINATING OR YOU NEED AN INTERVENTION.
OH, MY GOD.
YOU HAD A MAKEOVER
AND ARE NOW GOING TO BE PRETTIER THAN ME AT MY WEDDING.
NO.
OK.
QUICK QUESTION.
THIS IS MY FRIEND TAWNY'S DRESS.
AND IF I WEAR IT, I COULD SAVE BIG BUCKS.
BUT TAWNY DUMPED HER HUSBAND FOR HER KICKBOXING INSTRUCTOR.
SO IS IT BAD LUCK IF I WEAR THE DIVORCED DUMPER'S WEDDING DRESS?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WHAT DO I DO?
ELOPE.
DAN IN?
YEAH.
HE WANTS TO SPEAK TO YOU.
LEEANN'S BEEN CALLING, LIKE, 10 TIMES AND HE WON'T SPEAK TO HER.
(DOOR OPENS)
TELL ME YOU'RE GOING ON A WORK TRIP.
BROKE UP WITH LEEANN THIS MORNING.
BUT I'M DOING GREAT.
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.
OK.
THIS ISN'T HIGH SCHOOL.
YOU CAN'T JUST BREAK UP WITH YOUR WIFE.
LOOK, I WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING.
SHE CAN HAVE WHATEVER SHE WANTS.
OH, GOD.
DAN, YOU ARE SO GOING TO REGRET THIS.
I'M FINE.
SEE?
(PHONE RINGS)
YEAH, IT'S LEEANN.
DON'T TELL HER WHERE I AM.
OK?
OR WHERE I'M GOING.
AH.
IT'S HAPPENING.
THE PANICS.
OH, GOD.
HELLO?
HEY, LEEANN.
NO, I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.
YEAH, I WILL.
OK.
BYE.
THANK YOU.
WHERE WERE YOU EVEN PLANNING ON GOING?
OH, NO.
OH...
THANK YOU FOR THIS.
IF I DON'T WORK EVERY DAY, I GO A LITTLE CRAZY.
YOU LIKE YOUR WORK.
THAT'S NICE.
YOU LIKE YOUR WORK?
WORK'S WORK.
I WAS AN INSURANCE AGENT.
I HAVE A NATURAL GIFT FOR PREDICTING DOOM.
COULD YOU SHIFT THE BOTTOM HALF OF YOUR BODY TO THE LEFT?
OY!
I KNOW THIS ISN'T COMFORTABLE FOR YOU.
I HAVE A BUM BACK.
WELL, THEN FORGET POSING.
YOU WANT TO TRY PAINTING?
-ME, OH, NO.
NO.
-WHY NOT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
STILL LIFE?
SELF PORTRAIT?
I'LL GET YOU--
NO, NO, NO, NO.
MY WIFE.
SHE WAS THE CREATIVE ONE.
THAT WOMAN COULD DO ANYTHING WITH A GLUE GUN.
THEN DO IT FOR HER.
(DOOR BUZZES)
I'LL GET THE DOOR FOR YOU, YOUR MAJESTY.
OH, COME ON.
AH, GOOD EVENING, D-TOWN DEB.
HI, LIL G. THIS IS MY BROTHER DANIEL.
UNFORTUNATELY, HE'S GOING TO BE STAYING HERE.
AH, SWEET!
NICE TO MEET YOU, BROTHER DAN WITH A TAN.
NO, NO.
NO NICKNAME FOR HIM.
-HE DOES NOT DESERVE ONE.
-HMM.
(PHONE BEEPS)
-OH, GREAT.
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHO THAT WOULD BE TEXTING ME FOR THE 65TH TIME.
LEEANN.
IT'S DAD.
HE KNOWS HOW TO TEXT?
NO.
AND HE'S NOT UPSTAIRS.
OK, WE SHOULD GO.
WAIT A MINUTE.
I CAN'T TELL POP THAT I LEFT LEEANN.
UH, NO.
YOU ARE TELLING HIM.
YOU'RE TELLING HIM YOU CHEATED.
NO MORE LIES, DAN.
THAT'S THE DEAL.
OR YOU DON'T GET TO STAY HERE.
-BYE, LIL G.
-WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
I PROMISE THAT I WILL TELL HIM IN TIME.
BUT NOT NOW.
COME ON.
-WHOA.
-WHOA.
I JUST WANT TO FIND POP.
DAN:
BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE.
-OK.
CONTROL YOURSELF.
-WHAT IS HE DOING?
I THINK I SEE HIM.
YEAH, THERE HE IS.
THERE'S POP.
I CAN'T EVEN GET HIM TO STARBUCKS.
BUT HE'LL COME TO THIS PLACE.
SON, OH, I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU.
DANIEL, DEB, MEET MY FRIEND COOKIE.
-HI.
-HEY, HOW ARE YOU, MAN?
YEAH, WE'VE MET.
BUT WHERE DID YOU TWO MEET?

GOOD FOR THE PROSTATE.
REALLY?
IS THAT REALLY ALL YOU WANT?
YEAH.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
I WANT EVERYTHING.
I WANT LOVE.
AND I'M FINALLY FIGHTING FOR IT.
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN CRAZY ABOUT JAY FOR, LIKE, 10 YEARS.
AND IT'S JUST NOW THAT I'M DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
'CAUSE I'VE LEARNED YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR WHAT YOU WANT.
YOU FIGHT, I'LL PAINT.
I'M JUST SAYING THAT I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD GIVE UP SO EASILY, YOU KNOW?
I MEAN, IT'S BETTER TO HAVE LOVED AND LOST...
SOUNDS LIKE ONE OF YOUR ROMANCE NOVELS TO ME.
MAYBE.
BUT...
I THINK YOU'RE JUST AFRAID OF BEING HURT AGAIN.
GOT TO SUCK IT UP, COOKIE.
OH, YEAH?
HEH.
YEAH.
I HAVE TO GO TO THE LADIES' ROOM.
YEAH, I GOT TO GO, UM, SOMEWHERE.
I GOT TO PEE TOO.
NO, NO, NO.
POP, I WANT TO PEE BY MYSELF.
WELL, FINE.
WE'LL TAKE SEPARATE PEES.
(SIGHS)
WHAT?
SO YOU AND COOKIE?
-POP, PLEASE.
-NO, I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL.

I'M JUST RELIEVED IT'S SOMEONE WITH A PENIS.
LOOK, I DON'T LIKE COOKIE.
OK?

HE'S TOO TALL FOR YOU.
LISTEN TO ME.
I'M YOUR FATHER.
YOU NEED TO GROW UP AND FACE REALITY.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MARRY KOBE BRYANT.
STOP WITH THE KOBE BRYANT.
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH KOBE BRYANT, OK?
-I'M, LIKE, IN LOVE WITH JAY.
-JAY?
YEAH, WHY DO YOU THINK I'M SPENDING SO MUCH TIME FIXING UP HIS LOFT?
I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS YOUR TIME OF THE MONTH.
YOUR MOTHER USED TO REAPPLIQUE EVERY 30 DAYS.
OK.
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.
ALL RIGHT?
LET'S JUST TRY TO HAVE A FUN NIGHT.
-OK.
YOU HAVE FUN.
I'LL GO PEE.
-OK.

-FOR WHAT?
-FOR, UH...
JEWS FOR JESUS.

I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM.
-LET'S GO DO SOMETHING.
-RELAX.
RELAX.
I WANT TO GO FOR A WALK.

SIT.
ENJOY THE VIEW.
I CAN'T.
I'M MARRIED.
LOOK UP.
HEY, POP, YOU NEVER--
LOOKED AT THE PRETTY GIRLS?
ALL THE TIME BEFORE YOUR MOTHER.
HOW COULD YOU NOT LOOK OR IMAGINE?
-WE'RE MEN, RIGHT?
-RIGHT.
BUT WE'RE ALSO GOOD MEN.

WELL DONE.
SO IS DRESSING WEIRD PART OF SEX ADDICT THERAPY?
NO, I'M JUST INTO WEIRD NOW.
SO, LIKE, HOW MANY GUYS QUALIFIES YOU TO BE A SEX ADDICT?
COULD WE NEVER TALK ABOUT THIS, LIKE, EVER AGAIN, PLEASE?
ALL RIGHT.
THIS PLACE IS PRETTY AWESOME, HUH?
MAYBE I'LL MOVE TO THIS SIDE OF THE HILL AFTER THE DIVORCE.
LEEANN, PLEASE DON'T GO THERE.
WHY NOT?
HE'S THERE.
WHERE IS HE, DEB?
WHERE IS HE?
I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE HE IS.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF HE'S OK.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
WHAT DO I DO?
IT'S OK.
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER.
GO SAY GOODBYE TO MOLLY.

WELL, PERSONALLY, I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOUR MOTHER HAD A PERFECTLY FIND TUSH.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
SO, UM, WHERE IS DANIEL?
LONG WALK.
WHAT TIME'S COOKIE'S OPENING TONIGHT?
WE SHOULD GO MAYBE AROUND 8:00.
I'VE GOT A FEW MORE THINGS TO FINISH UP HERE.
SO YOU HANG WITH ELMER AND POP, AND I'LL FIND DAN.
OK?
(DOOR CLOSES)
YOU HAVE A FRIEND.
WE SURE DIDN'T START OUT THAT WAY.
RELATIONSHIPS CHANGE.
-SWEETHEART, WHAT'S WRONG?
-NOTHING.
NOTHING.
-WHERE'S THE BATHROOM?
-IT'S JUST BACK THERE.
(DAN BARKS)
OH, GOOD LORD.
UH...

HE CAN'T COME TO THE DOOR.
HE BAD DOG.
OH, GOD.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
DANIEL, GET YOUR BUTT BACK TO THE LOFT.
I'M NOT...

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
GOD, LEEANN IS IN JAY'S LOFT RIGHT NOW.
-WHAT?

JESUS, HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?
HOW COULD I DO THIS TO YOU?
STOP IT!
STOP IT!
OK!
I KNOW!
I KNOW!
I KNOW!
I SUCK!
OK.
BUT YOU CANNOT TELL LEEANN ABOUT THIS.
GOD, DAN.
I AM DONE.
I AM DONE.
I AM SO DONE DEALING WITH YOUR CRAP.
PLEASE, I BEG YOU!
OK.
YOU KNOW I LOVE LEEANN.
IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE, DAN.
YOU HAVE A CHOICE.
YOU CAN BE MARRIED OR YOU CAN BE SINGLE.
YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH.
OK.
OK.
OK.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WHAT'S IT GOING TO TAKE FOR YOU TO KEEP THIS QUIET?
HUH?
ANOTHER RAISE?
NO!
PARTNERSHIP?
RIGHT?
EQUAL PARTNERS AT THE AGENCY.
DORFMAN AND DORFMAN.
SO I DON'T TELL LEEANN THAT YOU CHEATED ON HER
AND YOU'LL MAKE ME YOUR EQUAL PARTNER?
WITH AN EQUAL SIZE OFFICE.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
HUH?
PARTNERS?
I SAY I QUIT.
YOU QUIT?
OH, YEAH.
I QUIT.
I QUIT.
DAN, I DON'T WANT TO BE YOUR PARTNER.
GOD, IT'S BAD ENOUGH I HAVE TO BE YOUR SISTER.
BUT I NEED YOU.
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME.
-DEB, YOU'RE MY ROCK!
-YOU'RE MY CHAIN, DAN!
TAKE A SHOWER.
TALK TO YOUR WIFE.
UNH!
(TEA KETTLE WHISTLES)
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS?
MY AUNTIE USED TO MAKE HERSELF A CUP OF TEA WHEN SHE WAS UPSET.
NOW YOU CAN CHOOSE BETWEEN
LIFE'S BLISSFUL BLEND, ENERGY CHARCO CHAI.
WHAT THE HELL IS YERBA MATE?
IN MY DAY WE HAD ONE TEA-- LIPTON'S.
BUT NOW YOU GOT TO CHOOSE BETWEEN OOLONG OOSHORT OOSHIT.
NO WONDER YOU PEOPLE ALL NEED THERAPY.
DAN WON'T GO TO THERAPY WITH ME.
-HUH?
(DOOR OPENS)
DAN?
HEY.
SO HE'S ON THE ROOF.
WHAT?
IS HE GOING TO JUMP?
NO.
NO.
OH, GOD, NO.
HE'S GOING TO TALK.
JUST TAKE THE STAIRS BY THE ELEVATOR.
OK.
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE?
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TALK TO YOUR SON ABOUT THAT.
DAN.
HEY.
FORGIVE ME.
I--I FREAKED AND I JUST NEED SOME SPACE.
DANIEL DOESN'T NEED THERAPY.
WHY SHOULD HE GO TO THERAPY?
'CAUSE HE'S PERFECT.
THAT'S WHY HE'S--
(SIGHS) NEVER MIND.
YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
AND YOU WOULDN'T KNOW.
THEY'RE MARRIED!
HOW BAD IS IT?
IT'S REALLY BAD.
IT'S NOT MY PLACE TO TELL YOU THOUGH.
WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME?
-I QUIT THE AGENCY.
-WHAT?
YOU CAN'T QUIT!
DANIEL WILL ALWAYS TAKE CARE OF YOU.
I DON'T NEED ANYONE TAKING CARE OF ME.
I SWEAR, BABE.
NOTHING HAPPENED.
I'VE JUST BEEN HERE HATING MYSELF FOR CAUSING YOU SUCH WORRY.
ARE YOU HAVING AN AFFAIR?
WHY WOULD I HAVE AN AFFAIR?
(SIGHS)
I WANT A BABY.
I'M GOING UP TO THE ROOF.
NO, POP.
DON'T RESCUE DANIEL.
HE NEEDS TO FACE LEEANN
AND YOU.
WHAT DID HE DO?
WHAT'S SO TERRIBLE?
HE'S A GOOD MAN, A GREAT SON, A HUSBAND, AND BROTHER.
AND YOU'RE NOT QUITTING THAT JOB.
YOU NEED HIM.
NO.
HE NEEDS ME, POP.
AND YOU NEED ME.
AND IT'S FREAKING KILLING ME.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
WE LOVE YOU.
I KNOW.
I KNOW.
AND I'M SORRY.
I KNOW YOU WORRY ABOUT MY SAFETY AND MY FUTURE.
YOU FEAR FOR ME, BUT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.
WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN?
IT MEANS TO YOU, I'M STILL THAT FAT, UNPOPULAR LITTLE GIRL.
AND DANIEL WILL FOREVER BE YOUR BRIGHT, SHINING STAR.
(DOOR OPENS)
EVERYTHING'S OK.
-LET ME GO FRESHEN UP.
-OK.
DANIEL, WHAT'S GOING ON?

-YOU CHEATED ON LEEANN?
-OK.
OK, POP.
I PROMISE I'M GOING TO MAKE IT UP TO LEEANN.
OK BELIEVE ME.
I AM GOING TO PAY.
I'M GOING TO PAY FOR HURTING HER.
-YOU LIED?
-I'M ASHAMED OF MYSELF.
LOOK.
I'LL MAKE IT UP TO BOTH OF YOU.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
DO YOU WANT SOMETHING NEW FOR YOUR CONDO?
(SIGHS) OH, GOD.

OH, AND YOU.
HEY.
SO WHAT'S NEW SINCE THE EDISON?
OH, GOD.

UM, I QUIT MY JOB.
WOW.
I MEAN, DO YOU LOVE ACCOUNTING?
NO ONE LOVES ACCOUNTING.
WHAT HAVE YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO DO?
I DON'T KNOW.
THEN THIS WILL REALLY BE FUN.
OK.
UM...
-SO...

I'M JUST GOING TO SUCK IT UP AND GO FOR IT.
AHEM.

JAY CAME HOME EARLY, AND HE WANTS TO HANG OUT WITH ME.
GREAT.
I COULD DRIVE TO THE LOFT, PACK UP, GO HOME,
AND YOU CAN HANG OUT WITH JAY.
COOKIE INVITED ME TO GO TO DINNER WITH HIM AND HIS PARENTS.
WHO DO YOU CHOOSE?
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
I MEAN, I HAVE BEEN CRAZY ABOUT JAY FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER, YOU KNOW.
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW HE FEELS ABOUT ME
AND THEN I'VE BEEN SPENDING ALL THIS TIME WITH COOKIE.
AND I HAVE ALL THESE FEELINGS THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN.
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
I CAN'T DO IT.
I CAN'T CHOOSE.
-DO YOU WANT TO JUST GO--
-YES, YOU CAN.
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING, DEBORAH.
PICK THE ONE WHO SEES WHAT I COULDN'T.
I SOLD YOU SHORT.
I SPOILED YOUR BROTHER,
WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY HE IS THE WAY HE IS.
BUT YOU,
MY DARLING DAUGHTER,
ARE THE MOST WONDERFUL PERSON I KNOW.
BUT DIDN'T KNOW.
CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME?
OF COURSE I CAN.
AND YOU'LL START LIVING FOR YOU KNOW.
YEAH.
GOOD.
NOW GET IN THERE AND CHOOSE.
OK.
AND YOU'LL START LIVING NOW TOO?
WITH THIS SHIRT, I HAVE A CHOICE?
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

THE WIDOWS OF KABUL AND I THANK YOU.
YOU KNOW, I MADE THAT MYSELF.

BUT I DID LEARN HOW TO WEAVE THIS WEEK THANKS TO YOU.
HMM.
AND I LEARNED SO MUCH THIS WEEK THANKS TO YOU
AND THE D-TOWN HITLIST THAT YOU LEFT FOR ME.
THE WHAT?
THE COOL MAP OF DOWNTOWN THAT YOU LEFT FOR ME.
OH, YEAH.
SOME NEIGHBOR NAMED COOKIE MADE THAT AND GAVE IT TO ME AS A HOUSEWARMING GIFT.
THERE ARE SO MANY GAYS DOWNTOWN.
OH, NO.
HE'S NOT--
I WOULD NOT GIVE YOU SOME CHEESY MAP.
MY GIFT TO YOU WAS THE PRECIOUS MARTENBOROUGH VINYARD PINOT NOIR
FROM MY SEXY MARRIAGE SUIT IN NEW ZEALAND.
OH.
SORRY.
AND THANK YOU.
BUT YOU KNOW, THE REAL GIFT YOU GAVE ME WAS BEING ABLE TO STAY HERE.
I FEEL LIKE I'M THIS TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSON NOW.
I EVEN QUIT MY JOB.
FINALLY GOT SMART, HUH?
YOU KNOW, I GIVE YOU A WEEK BEFORE DANIEL IS GOING TO MAKE YOU PARTNER.
OH, NO, NO, NO.
I GOT TO MAKE A CAREER CHANGE TOO.
LET ME TELL YOU.
I HAVE PUT IN SO MUCH FACE TIME.
I SHOULD BE AN ANCHOR RIGHT NOW AT LEAST AT FOX.
RADIO SHOW TIE-INS AND SIX-FIGURE SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS.
HOW COOL WOULD THAT BE?
(SIGHS) I GOT TO FIRE MY AGENTS AGAIN.
I'VE BEEN NICHING WITH THIS GUERILLA STUFF FOR WAY TOO LONG.
IT'S KILLING ME.
WELL, YOU'VE BEEN NICHING?
I MEAN, I THOUGHT THAT--
I THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE REPORTING.
YOU ARE SO ADORABLE.
NOW TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR WEEKEND.
HELLO?
SORRY.
UM...
WELL, ACTUALLY WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE, I GOT TO TELL YOU,
I WAS SORT OF--
OFF.
GOOD.
GOOD.
I DIDN'T SEE THAT ONE.
UH, DO YOU LIKE THE LOFT?
I ASKED YOU THAT EARLIER.
DO--WHAT--HOW DO YOU LIKE THE LOFT?
IT'S GREAT.
I LOVE THE MASKS.
WHEN I GOT THEM, I KNEW THEY WOULD BE PERFECT.
I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THE COLOR THOUGH.
RED?
I MEAN, REALLY?
WELL, I'M SORRY, I--
WELL...
IT WAS ANOTHER COLOR, BUT UM...
WELL, I'D LIKE--YOU KNOW WHAT?
I COULD REPAINT IT FOR YOU.
SORRY.
SHH.
YOU'RE FORGIVEN.
AND FORGIVEN.
MMM.
NO.
NO.
NO!
YOU'RE FORGIVEN.
I'M NOT--
YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE WHO'S SORRY.
I MEAN, HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THIS?
I MEAN, WAS I JUST SO IN MY HEAD, IN MY FANTASYLAND

AND THEN YOU GRAB MY-- WHAT THE--I GOT TO GO.

WOMAN THROUGH SPEAKERS:
DESIRE RAGED IN EVERY PORE OF HIS BODY.
A FLASH OF HEAT POUNDED HIS LOINS.
FOR SHE WAS A SIREN.
HE MARVELED AT THE SUPPLE ARCH OF HER BEAUTIFUL BACK,
HER TINY WASTE TAPERING TO A HEART-SHAPED DERNIER.
HE CROUCHED IN FRONT OF HER SEATED FORM.
CHAPTER THREE.
"LET ME LOVE YOU," HE WHISPERED.
SHE WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO RESIST THIS.

WE'RE PREPARED FOR THIS.
YOU GOT A PRENUP.
MOLLY, IS DEB IN?
YES, MR. DORFMAN.
[TYPING]
HEY, DEB, I'M OUT OF HERE AFTER LUNCH TODAY.
GOT TO GO SCHMOOZE WILLIAMS.
YOU FINISH HIS NUMBERS?
-YEAH.
-I NEED YOU TO PULL UP ALLEN KLEIN'S PRENUP.

UH...

A MONTH AGO.
I'M GIVING YOU SOMETHING BETTER--
A NEW 17.3-INCH LAPTOP.
I'LL SEE YOU SUNDAY, DEB.
YOU'RE MY ROCK!
-YOU'RE MY ROLL.
-ROCK AND ROLL!
SO I SAID TO MYSELF, "LEEANN, LISTEN TO YOUR LIFE COACH
AND ANSWER THE QUESTION.
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO BE HAPPY?"
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I ANSWERED?
A RALPH LAUREN MENORAH?
DON'T MAKE FUN OF MY MENORAH COLLECTION.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO TO CONVERSION CLASS
AND HONOR THE TRADITIONS OF OUR HEBREW PEOPLE.
SORRY.
OK.
SO WHAT IS IT THAT YOU NEED TO BE HAPPY?
I NEED A BABY.
BUT YOU HAVE A BABY, NAMED DANIEL.
HEH.
BOOM.
UHH...
YOU DON'T FOOL ME, DEB.
YOU JUST CRACK JOKES TO HIDE YOUR TRUE FEELINGS.
WELL, 'CAUSE NOBODY WANTS TO LISTEN.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
WE'RE HERE FOR YOU.
WELL...
OK.
YOU KNOW, LEEANN,
THE TRUTH IS I'VE REALLY BEEN MISSING MY MOM LATELY.

OLD PRUNES.
YEAH.
DON'T SURRENDER, DEB.
GET IN THE GAME AND FIGHT.

DON'T BE AFRAID.
OK.
SO WHAT DO I NEED TO BE HAPPY?
WELL...
I NEED TO KNOW WHY THIS TABLE IS SET FOR FIVE.
OH, NO.

I'M SORRY I'M SUCH A BUMMER FOR YOU, DANIEL.

ELMER, STOP, YOU LITTLE BRAT.
[MEOW]
-BETTER GET USED TO ME.
I PLAN ON SPENDING A LOT OF TIME HERE.
WOMAN ON IPOD:
HE WAS DETERMINED TO BRING HER TO THE PINNACLE OF ECSTASY
AS THE HEAT OF THEIR PASSION WHIRLED AROUND THEM,
COCOONING THEM IN SILKEN STRANDS OF PLEASURE.
DESIRE TOOK ON A FINE, SHARP EDGE.
[PHONE RINGS]
THIS IS DEB.
I THOUGHT POP WAS GETTING BETTER.
DEB:
HE IS.
SIX MONTHS AGO, HE WOULDN'T GET OUT OF BED.
AND NOW HE WON'T STOP WATCHING QVC.
YOU KNOW HOW MOM LOVED THAT STUFF.
GOD, HE ADORED HER.
TRUE THAT.
I MISS MOM.
I EVEN MISS IT--
YEAH, DEB, I AM CLUELESS ABOUT HOW TO HELP POP.
YOU GOT TO GET SOMEBODY ELSE TO WATCH JAY'S DOG.

I'M CAT SITTING.
OH.
AND HOW WAS YOUR DAY, D-TOWN DEB?
OH, I DON'T REMEMBER.
I WAS STUCK IN TRAFFIC
THE LAST HOUR AND A HALF FROM ENCINO.
WELL, TOMORROW, YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY TAKING THE METRO TO THE VALLEY.
NO STRESS, NO MESS.
OK.
GOD, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING HERE.
YOU PROBABLY STOPPED TO GET THE MAIL.
I CAN DO THAT.
-HI.
-HI.
FRIEND OF JAY'S?
UM, YES, I AM CAT SITTING FOR A CAT THAT HATES ME.
AND CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHY WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY
TO PUT A MAN IN OUTER SPACE BUT WE CAN'T MAKE A MAILBOX KEY
THAT ACTUALLY OPENS AND--
YEAH.
AND A THOUSAND PIECES OF JUNK MAIL.
THAT'S GREAT.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE PLANET NEEDS.
WE SHOULD KILL MORE TREES AND SMALL CREATURES--
YEAH, I HATE JUNK MAIL.
THIS IS AN INVITE TO MY ART OPENING FRIDAY.
OH.

WHERE'S YOUR HUSBAND?

HE, UM...
HE'S A TOTAL LIE.
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
OK.
NOW WHAT?
WOMAN ON IPOD:
HER LIGHT BREATH FEATHERED THE HOLLOW OF HIS CHEEK.
WHEN HER TONGUE TENTATIVELY TOUCHED HIS,
HE WAS SWEPT INTO A SWIRLING MAELSTROM OF LONGING.
HER EYES WERE DILATED WITH PASSION.
AND SO HE DRIFTED EVER LOWER,
FINALLY HALTING TO TEASE THE BUD OF HER BREAST
DRAWING IT AS INTENSELY AS HE DARED INTO THE DEPTHS OF HIS MOUTH.
HER LEGS OPENED FULLY WIDE, LIKE A BUTTERFLY'S WINGS ON A SPRING MORNING--
[SKYPE RINGS]

HEY, IT'S ALLEN.
HEY, ALLEN.
OH, I HEAR YOU, BUDDY.
WE'LL DO THE FRONT NINE THIS TIME.
OH, HEY, REALLY BIG FAVOR.
MY BRIDAL SHOWER IS THIS FRIDAY.
AND I STILL DON'T HAVE A MAID OF HONOR.
ALL MY FRIENDS ARE MARRIED AND HAPPY AND LA LA.
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE THE ONLY SINGLE GIRL I KNOW.

IT'S AN INSULT AND AN HONOR.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

THANKS.
HARD AT WORK?
UH, YEAH.
WHAT'S UP?
WELL, I JUST WANTED TO INTRODUCE YOU TO OUR TWO NEW CLIENTS.
THIS IS CHELSEA AND VRONKA.
THIS IS MY BROTHER DANIEL.
YOU DIDN'T TELL US YOU HAD A HOT BROTHER.
WHO HAS HOT SHOT OFFICE IN BORING SUBURB?
WELCOME TO THE AGENCY.
HOW ABOUT I TAKE YOU TWO TO LUNCH AND EXPLAIN WHAT I'M GOING TO DO FOR YOU?
NO NEED, DANNY.
WE WANT DEB TO BE OUR ACCOUNTANT.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE DEB OUT FOR BIG, GLORIOUS CELEBRATION FOR SAVING US BIG BUCKS.
APPLEBEE'S?
DO THEY NOT HAVE SPEED LIMITS IN POLAND?
WE PARTY DOWN THERE.
OH, NO, NO, NO.
I TAKE ONE TOKE OF THAT,
AND I GAIN BACK ALL THE WEIGHT I'VE LOST.
AND FRANKLY MY SELF ESTEEM IS QUESTIONABLE AS IS.
NO SELF ESTEEM?
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE NEEDS, VRONKA?
I DO.
DEB:
OK.
SO WHERE ARE YOU GUYS TAKING ME?
IT'S CLICHE.
UGLY DUCKLING INTO BEAUTIFUL SWAN MAKEOVER.
OH, I'M OK THE WAY I AM.
OH, IS THAT REALLY WORKING FOR YOU?
JUST BEING JAY'S CAT SITTER?
YOU'RE SO INTO THE BOY.
COME ON, DEB.
CONFESS.
YES, I'M INTO HIM.
AND HE FINALLY KISSED ME.
WELL, HE KISSED ME ONCE BEFORE.
BUT IT WAS AT MY BROTHER'S WEDDING.
AND IT DOESN'T COUNT BECAUSE HE WAS DRUNK,
AND HE PUKED RIGHT AFTERWARDS.
BUT ANYWAY, THE POINT IS I'VE GOT FOUR DAYS
TO FIX UP HIS LOFT.
AND THEN--
THEN WHAT?
YOU LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER?
GET REAL, CINDERELLA.
YOU MIGHT BE A BOMB ACCOUNTANT,
BUT WE KNOW MEN.
GIVE THE LOFT AND YOU A MAKEOVER.
AND IN THE CONQUEST FOR JAY WILL BE ASSURED.
BUT I--I DON'T WANT TO LOOK LIKE A HOOKER.
I HEARD THAT, DEB.
I KNOW.
[KNOCKING AT DOOR]
DEB?
HI.
WHAT?
ARE YOU TRYING TO PICK UP SAILORS?
NO, POP!
HELLO.
I GOT A MAKEOVER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
PRETTY HOT, RIGHT?
TEPID?
ALL RIGHT, I KNOW.
IT'S A BIT MUCH.
I MEAN, IT'S NOT REALLY ME.
BUT YOU KNOW, I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHO ME IS YET.
I'M STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS.
YOU GOT SUITCASES-- WALKING IN--WHY--WHY--
WHY DOES HE HAVE A SUITCASE?
BECAUSE POP MISSED YOU.
HEY, NOW I GOT TO GO.
LEEANN IS IN A BABYMAKING WINDOW.
OH, NO, NO, NO.
YOU ARE NOT JUST DROPPING POP HERE.
WHAT THE HELL KIND OF PLACE IS THIS?
PIPES EVERYWHERE?
NO WALLS.
NO CARPETING.
IT'S MODERN, POP.
WELL, IS THERE A BATHROOM?
OR AM I SUPPOSED TO TAKE
A MODERN PISS RIGHT HERE ON CEMENT FLOOR?
YES, THERE'S A TOILET.
GO TO THE RIGHT.
UNH.
GOD.
YOU COULDN'T JUST WAIT 'TIL SATURDAY?
I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU, OK?
HOW ABOUT A BRAND NEW WIRELESS OFFICEJET PRINTER?
NO.
WITH A NEW 20-INCH LCD MONITOR?
-NO.
-WITH A NEW--
-WHAT DO YOU WANT?
-I WANT MY RAISE.
I DESERVE THAT RAISE, DANIEL.
SO $200 MORE A WEEK
OR POP GOES HOME WITH YOU.
THEY GIVE YOU A PAIR OF CAJONES WITH THIS MAKEOVER?
NO.
BUT I DID GIVE THE AGENCY A PAIR OF MODELS.
[TOILET FLUSHES]
-SO DEAL?
OR DO YOU WANT TO JUST TAKE POP?
POP:
YOUR MODERN TOILET JUST BLOW DRIED MY TOOKUS.
DEAL.
JUST GAVE DEB A RAISE, POP.
POP:
IS YOUR BROTHER THE GREATEST OR WHAT?
THE GREATEST.
NOW I GOT TO GO.
STILL MY ROCK?
ROCK WITH A RAISE.
ROLL.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER, POP.
OK?
POP:
THE TV IS BROKEN.
GOD THERE ISN'T EVEN A TV.
THERE IS A TV.
IT'S UPSTAIRS WHERE YOU'LL BE SLEEPING COMFORTABLY.
INSTEAD OF ME.
WHAT'S WITH THE VERKAKTE STAIRCASE.
HEY, BABY, I'M ON MY WAY.
HURRY!
THIS IS THE LAST NIGHT I'M OVULATING.
THE WINDOW IS CLOSING.
I REPEAT, THE WINDOW IS CLOSING.
LOOK WHO'S HERE.
JEWISH BROTHER DANIEL.
YOU PARTY WITH US NOW.
I CAN'T.
I'M MARRIED.
WHO PAYS TO COOK THEIR OWN FOOD
AND EAT WITH STRANGERS?
TRY THE SAKI.
HOT WINE?
I TELL YOU,
THE JAPANESE COULD SELL ANYTHING.
GOD, COULD YOU BE MORE OFFENSIVE?
SINCE WHEN DO YOU EAT JAPANESE?
SINCE I'M TRYING NEW THINGS.
OK?
I LIKE IT HERE.
IT'S CUTE, POP.
COME ON, LOOK AT THE LAMPS.
THEY'RE LIKE LITTLE SCULPTURES.
THEY'RE MADE OUT OF PAPER.
THEY COST NOTHING.
I'LL BET THEY INVENTED BOTTLED WATER TOO.
GOD...
PLEASE TRY TO BE MORE OPEN.
PLEASE TRY THE SAKI.
NOBODY LOVED WINE MORE THAN YOUR MOTHER.
NOTHING FANCY OR HEATED.
SHE'D BE HAPPY YOUR BROTHER GAVE YOU A RAISE.
HEY, MAYBE ONE DAY I'LL WORK MY WAY UP TO BEING DAN'S PARTNER.
I'D RATHER SEE YOU WITH A HUSBAND AND KIDS.
YOU KNOW, NOT EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET MARRIED, POP.
NOT EVERYBODY WANTS TO STOP EVERYTHING AND HAVE KIDS.
HERE WE GO.
I CAN'T TALK TO YOU.
I'LL JUST SIT HERE AND DRINK OVERPRICE, HEATED WINE.
SORRY.
WHAT THEY HELL ARE YOU LOOKING AT?
[WHISPERS] TURN AROUND.
TURN AROUND.
JUST STOP.
GOD, WHY DOES EVERYTHING HAVE TO BE SO HARD?
WHY DO I ALWAYS HAVE TO YELL AT YOU TO EAT?
PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, TRY THIS.
IT'S DELICIOUS.
HAPPY NOW?
DANCING ON THE CEILING.
-TASTES GOOD.
-GOOD.
BUT I WOULDN'T MIND A SANDWICH.
YOU SURE IT'S SAFE?
YEAH, IT'S JUST THE CITY, POP.
WHO'S THAT?
THE MAYOR?
LOOK.
OK.
YOU CAN'T SHOW ANY FEAR DOWN HERE.
RIGHT?
YOU JUST HAVE TO ASSUME BADASS ATTITUDE.
LET'S HOPE THEY DON'T SEE THE URINE RUNNING DOWN MY LEG.
ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE ALMOST HOME.
HOME HAS A KITCHEN THAT'S NOT IN THE LIVING ROOM.
YOU CAN SURVIVE FOUR MORE DAYS.
I CAN'T SURVIVE FOR FOUR MORE SECONDS.
MOVE!
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WALKING DOWN HERE, DO YOU HEAR ME?
YES, ADMITTEDLY, IT IS A LITTLE BIT SCARY.
BUT, HEY, MAYBE A LITTLE SCARY IS GOOD FOR US, RIGHT?

YOU LIKE YOUR WORK?
WORK'S WORK.
I WAS AN INSURANCE AGENT.
I HAVE A NATURAL GIFT FOR PREDICTING DOOM.
COULD YOU SHIFT THE BOTTOM HALF OF YOUR BODY TO THE LEFT?

'CAUSE I'VE LEARNED YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR WHAT YOU WANT.
YOU FIGHT, I'LL PAINT.
I'M JUST SAYING THAT I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD GIVE UP SO EASILY, YOU KNOW?
I MEAN, IT'S BETTER TO HAVE LOVED AND LOST...

ARE YOU HAVING AN AFFAIR?
WHY WOULD I HAVE AN AFFAIR?
[SIGHS]
I WANT A BABY.
I'M GOING UP TO THE ROOF.

IT'S GREAT.
I LOVE THE MASKS.
WHEN I GOT THEM, I KNEW THEY WOULD BE PERFECT.

IT'S BEAUTIFUL, DAN.
I LOVE YOU.
LOVE YOU, BABE.
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.
BUT IT'S THE ONLY THING I'M SORRY FOR.
BECAUSE IT'S ALL LED ME HERE TO YOU.
["GLOW" BY DONOVAN FRANKENREITER PLAYS]
In the previous section contents:
My sister is not left on their own feet.
I think something happened to him and anyone he came up with this story, that reality obscures.
Belén lucky woman.
Other men do not forgive, they left.
Do not leave me, here with me.
Do not kellesd it here.
My son will notice what you truly are:
a whore.
My mother, I know the kid who wants to give me, that of the maid.
- I do not want that kid.
- This is the time to visit?
That child is Diego.
Listen, my dear.
She is director of the hotel made you and trusted you, because ostobákkal a world full're not made mistakes.
- Did you find anything?
- Yes.
- Diego and my sister were lovers.
- I do not know.
Nothing to it.
It is not found on this photo, not on it.
But why would he do that?
To kill a maid?
- I need to talk to you, Detective Ayala.
- This agreement will help you double.
Salary and get rid of the kid once born.
As I found out, anyone can learn.
Do not you realize that this incriminate?
What do you want?
That everyone finds out that the pregnancy is a lie?
"Circling and arrest warrant against Julio Olmedo, for murder."
"Immediately it should be arrested and handed over to the judiciary."
I'm not going anywhere until then, while you do not know who killed my sister.
- I think there's something else.
- One more thing?
There may be some other reason you do not go away.
Do not talk nonsense.
You did me a favor, and I will pay for it.
But I do not need the child.
Those who have been brought up, withdrew.
It's called the Ruta plant.
Two spoonfuls is enough to get rid of the kid.
I make a cup of tea.
You can ask Catalina?
Yes?
- Igen.
- Catalina.
Drink this instead, it langyosabb.
Cristina Olmedo disappeared during the Light Festival, where in theory you were down there, but some of the photos
It shows that this was not the case.
One employee
You testified that you received a blackmail message, which demanded money, elhallgatásáért in exchange for what happened Cristina Olmedóval.
You slept with a whore.
What else are you hiding from me yet?
Just the fact that I slept with him, I understand that it will not act prematurely in the mouth.
That the case go forward, you will need that person's testimony, who has the most information, and we both know who they are.
It is understandable that you are afraid to Julio.
The confession is synonymous with loss of freedom.
I'm not scared about losing my freedom, Alicia.
The main witness working at the hotel, and at 6 am going to testify before the judge.
- Kill him.
- How will I know who it is?
At a quarter to 5 will start at the hotel.
- Cristina ...
- Hello, brother!
GRAN HOTEL Part 7:
The Stolen Letter
Someone knocked down when ... when I went there.
And your job done?
Almost, sir, but I could not finish.
I very much regret having been knocked out, Garrido, but ... we can not leave things pending.
And what do you want me to do?
Talk with Benjamin and find out who missed the briefing, I asked, to retain.
If you know who it is, do it,
Do not do that again set foot in the hotel.
Yes, sir.
Fire an employee for having missed a briefing?
Hernando, discipline is essential.
And what do you do if you really make a mistake?
Killing?
What are you talking about ...
I hope that no one saw us.
And the bloody clothes?
And the anonymous letters?
I thought you were dead.
I'm sorry.
Everyone thinks you're dead.
The Supervisory Board.
They think I killed like the other woman.
It is better if we continue to believe this.
Why?
Because many people want him dead.
I discovered something.
Something that could mean the end of the Gran Hotel.
The first months were very hard.
I worked all week, and so I could barely save that our mother be sent.
Do not you have none?
My family needs the money, Belén.
You also need it.
Of course, only if you do not want to spend your whole life for this hotel.
The pride is a bad adviser, Cristina, and now sit just next to it.
My father worked in a vineyard for 20 years.
By age 30 he could barely walk straight, the charred skin, and felt lucky if you slept more than four hours at night.
Here we sleep much any more.
He had to stand in the accommodation and food for the salary.
Which it was a very serious matter, Belén.
When Doña Teresa also do so would be to pay,
Instead of the payment in order to work at the Grand Hotel.
Do what you want, but I do not want to stay here and to end up like him.
Alone, desperate, without a home.
Actually, it was happening right in Him.
Whatever he said Doña Ángela, that was not enough money for anything.
Therefore, when Sebastián, the pub owner cantaloai
Recommended earned money on things at the hotel, I said yes.
So it's true.
You stole.
A couple of bottles of wine, cigarettes, liquor, perfume, things that never would have missed them.
You know how many clothes you Señorita Alarcónnak?
How many perfume?
No, Julio.
He does not know.
Never going to miss him.
One evening, when old Don Carlos's study analyzed buried a bottle,
I found something.
Who told you to clean your room with Don Diego working?
Because I do not remember that I had been.
It was the express wish Ma'am, Don Diego.
You can ask him.
I do not think that would be required.
If I do, it would mean that I think you're lying to me.
Go to the clothing store and make sure we have all the tablecloths out hardened.
Doña Pilar daughter Hermida led only once in the company.
And even though you do not understand what this means, I will not be responsible for the disaster.
Yes, ma'am.
I do not know who would write hid there, Julio, but as soon as I read, I knew it was worthwhile.
Why?
What was it?
Something that makes you lose your hotel Doña Teresa.
- What did you do with the letter?
- I hid.
Our rooms are not secure.
And if someone would have found it,
I did not want to find out is to do with the letter.
My daughter, this is the key to the cellar.
Choose Alfredo good wine, not thinking about the price.
The prince should pay particular attention.
Do not worry, mom.
I have an idea when Doña Teresa was cleaning room.
The locker key for each copy kept by the hotel.
Guests are Safe Deposit ...
But I have found a safer place.
Stacks of the gold box is rarely opened, and you only do Benjamín.
Doña Teresa never miss the key.
But then I made a mistake.
I left a bad man.
I have to go back to Madrid in a few weeks.
So we will not have to be hiding.
I do not think that the hotel would stay until then.
Are you leaving?
You think you can find something better?
Have I found it.
He was working room.
I do not know what you're talking about, Cristina.
Well ... about something that may interest you.
Felezhetnénk is.
I never had to go.
I am sure that he was betrayed.
We both know that you've got something that belongs to me.
And you will not go away from here as long as you do not give back.
If you do something with me, everyone will know the truth and you will lose the hotel.
- Are you threatening me?
- Understand the way you want.
Then I realized that only one thing to do: escape.
If you want to take my daughter to get what's mine.
And I did that night.
Festival of Lights.
While everyone was at the ceremony, I went back to my room.
But someone followed.
I ran into the garden, and then I saw someone else in the shadows.
I could not see his face, but he had a golden knife.
And the light paralyzed.
And that's why ...
Diego caught.
Where is the letter?
- Give it to me!
- No!
Diego is in jail.
The charges of the murder.
And because of all the other women.
Well, they are wrong, Julio.
Diego despicable figure.
But he is not killing the golden knife.
Who is it?
I do not know.
I could barely see for a moment.
While it has not gotten Diego.
He thought he was dead.
Pascual smoke came out and saw that Diego chased me.
Once he was alone, he pulled out of the water.
Cristina.
Wake up, please.
Wake up, for God's sake.
Do not do this to me.
Groomed almost a month, he thought he would never be built up.
I was feverish, and talked away.
And if he does not, I would have died.
The first request was to go to my room, and bring the key to the cabinet Stacks of gold.
I have kept in my room under the floor.
But it was not there.
And none of the photos that have kept there, Julio.
- Someone took everything.
- I think I know who it was.
- I am.
- Do you have the key?
In my room.
When I started working in the hotel,
I knew something was wrong with you.
And the first thing I did was scan the room.
And then there was the key.
I was sure that the key is to do with being missing.
Why did you want to get the letter?
I almost died because of it.
I could not let that remain in this respect.
Diego was so hated that I decided my zeal.
And I pull out of it as much money as enough to escape Pascuallal.
And my only chance was led to believe it if I died.
And that someone knows what he did to me.
Again?
I hope the money has been initialized.
You better be accurate.
But the day I Pascualnak had received the money, time almost stood.
Pascual ...
I knew that something had happened to him.
I saw him when he died.
And the last time he told me how much he loves you.
The next day was a burglar in the house.
I could not let that take away my things, so I ran and knocked.
- I hit it with all my strength.
- I see.
And it was strong because they did not dare to come back ever since.
You should have seen my brother.
I can imagine.
I took my belongings and I had to give away to Monte de Piedade is the only valuable:
a piece of jewelry I gave Diego.
I started Nyomorogni.
Or starve, or recover the damn letter.
That's what I do, when I saw you when you leave the hotel.
I cut your way to receive signals, and saw the man who wanted to shoot you down.
Did you see who it was?
Garrido, Diego right hand.
I went to testify against Diego because of ... death.
I suppose Garrido wanted to stop it.
What was that?
Someone outside.
Alicia!
What are you doing here?
I could not stand to testify, and followed you.
Cristina?
You're alive?
No one knows it.
Diego is in prison because he is suspected of meggyilkolásoddal.
Excuse me, miss, but I do not regret Don Diego.
Faces can spend rest of his days behind bars.
- The võlegényemrõl about.
- You testified against yourself.
Because I thought it was dead Cristina Diego's fault.
But I was wrong.
Not killed, but he wanted.
If it passes, the Gran Hotel lake tab.
They wanted to set aside, at any cost.
They wanted?
Who?
The Grand Hotel Doña Teresa, nothing happens without permission.
You accused my mother to a planned murder?
This is crazy.
- Alicia, hear me out.
- No, you listen to me, Julio!
An accused in the murder võlegényemet I did not commit.
I need to talk Ayalával.
Alicia!
Alicia, wait, please.
Do not talk Ayalával.
Why?
Diego did not kill your sister, Pascual also told.
And why you would do anything for my mother Cristina?
He is the head of the Gran Hotel.
If you do not want a maid, you just have to provide.
He could not.
My sister discovered something about your family, Alicia.
Which is why your mother may lose the hotel.
In a letter to.
Diego and mother knew that and wanted to get back there Cristinánál.
Therefore Diego followed during the celebration of light, and therefore wanted to kill him.
If your sister is telling the truth and doing justice Ayala.
- You can not prove it.
- Then how you want me to believe?
You want you to believe you have your sister?
I find the letter and prove it.
But please do not tell anyone you saw my sister.
Drifting into trouble, and me too.
Garrido rámlõtt because I wanted to testify against Diego.
And if it were not to hide Diego, Alicia,
I do not care that I testify.
I do not believe your sister, Julia.
You get a day off.
Tomorrow I'm talking Ayalával.
- You let him go?
- It will not say anything.
- Julio!
- Trust me.
I believe in you, but it is not.
You do not know how, do not know the Alarcónokat.
- Alicia is not like the others.
- Alicia ...
So you call Señorita Alarcónt?
My friend helped me find you.
Thanks to them, I'm here.
You fall in love?
I know you, brother.
And still others love it, who does not suit you.
You did not talk to him about the letter ?
!
Where is the letter?
Where are you hide?
If he gets it, it destroys.
It, however, can be valuable.
A lot of money we can get him and take our revenge on them.
Hardly know you, Cristina.
The theft of love, blackmail, lies ...
You were not like that.
You did good and kind.
They made me this way.
The Alarcónok and damned Hotel.
Therefore, it must regain the letter.
I recover.
But I will give to the police.
If you want to pay the price for his crime, that's the only way.
Where is the letter?
The golden knife cabinet.
Second account during the dinner service.
Wait for me here.
I come soon.
Raise your glasses, toast our future of the hotel, and Alfredo Vergarára and Sofía Alarcónra.
The first grandchild's parents.
Ma'am.
Sir.
Thank you very much.
Alicia, you're late.
Where have you been?
Just I walked one.
What happened?
Our mother has just announced that Alfredo will be the director of the hotel.
I know that Diego fiancee, and I'm sorry, but ...
Mother can not trust a man who committed a murder.
- It was not a judgment, Sofía.
- Now you defending him?
I just hope that we can see the truth.
- Alfredo, congratulations.
- Thank you, Alicia.
- I am very proud of you, my love.
- Thank you, darling.
Thanks to you and your children I am the happiest man in the world.
- Something happened, Sofía?
- Are a lot of excitement.
Tired, right, daughter?
Again.
It has megbocsátotok.
Doña Teresa, I assure you that you will not mind.
I not voluntarily chose you, my dear.
You know I did not have much choice.
It has megbocsátanak.
Mother, I want to know what the situation Diego.
- Ayala agent takes care of everything.
- I understand our engagement.
After it occurred better when decomposed.
I assume you're happy for him.
Do not say I did feel something for Diego.
It was my fiancée, now in prison.
Not exactly a welcome situation.
Mother, I need to talk to you.
It is important.
What's so important?
My mother did not want to be anymore West.
I promise I will not ...
I swear that there are no more problems, and now I want to take responsibility for the family.
And the hotel management.
I understand the distrust, but I decided to change.
And I ask, when you bring this astonishing decision?
I met with the general and Doña Mercedes-winds when they left.
While Eugenia was not sane,
I know that because of me died.
And your sister ... and almost the duel, when ... when I saw the way the general mean me ... everything has changed.
I've been trying to steer the right path.
Maybe I should have to grab a gun to my megértessem.
Now I am determined, my mother.
What would you do in my place, Javier?
There are so many reasons you gave me not to trust you to it would be understandable if you do not believe me.
Give me a chance, just one.
I know that you and my father always they wanted to make a point the hotel Alarcón.
The dance begins at 9 am, so it is levied at 8 o'clock the tables.
Circulating American dance style, open-figures, so much space will be needed.
- Take this into consideration.
- Yes, Benjamín do.
Sorry, Benjamín do.
I would like to know if anyone missed the briefing.
Yes.
He missed one serving.
Julio Espinosa.
Julio, what are you doing here?
I thought you left.
Something happened.
I do not know what happened or what you did, but
Benajamínnak do when I wanted to say that you left, appeared Garrido, don Diego segítõje, és felõled érdeklõdött.
- Faces?
- Well, not exactly, but he wanted to know who missed the briefing.
Perfect.
Put into place.
Are you sad, Alicia, I see.
Do not look like pictures.
I've known you since my childhood, and I know that Diego is due.
- That's right, lady.
- It is very beautiful and rich.
Like me.
But younger.
No shortage seekers.
- Thank you very much.
- Cheer up, my daughter.
Now what you want, Julio?
Alicia, an important thing happened.
- Espinosa.
- Yes, sir?
Stay with me.
- Here's Senor Garrido.
- Thank you.
- How can I help?
- Walk with me.
Come on.
Julio, thank you for helping me in the afternoon to shop.
Don Benjamín, excuse me, that I booked one of the waiters,
Diego but his absence we all have to work together.
They rendben go, Ms. Alarcon.
- The Miss was in the afternoon?
- Yes.
- I said, Garrido, is something wrong?
- I do not.
- Where do I come with her?
- Nowhere.
You do not have to.
- Thank you very much.
- I helped you, but I would like you to do something in return.
Find the letter and bring it to me.
Finally occupy the place that you deserve.
Yes, of course.
Uncle Don Ernesto García de Carvajal for there will always be space in the hotel.
Yes.
Perfect, see you soon.
Bye for now.
May I ask, what are you doing here, Javier?
- We did not tell our mother?
- What?
You stand in front of the hotel's new Director.
What is it?
The basic politeness've forgotten it?
Javier behaves as if he were the director of the hotel.
Because it's the new hotel manager.
- This is impossible!
- Javier irresponsible mother.
This hotel offers rooms only familiar with the maids.
And the wine cellar.
Therefore, it becomes the deputy director Alfredo.
But a couple of hours he was appointed Director of the hotel.
No, my dear.
I did not use that word.
I trust the fate of the hotel.
As deputy director.
Javier gives its name, and you're Institute matters and oversee the work.
- So I'll Javier nanny.
- Call it whatever you want.
- It is not fair, Mother.
- Life is not fair, my love.
For you, as a woman, you should know.
And you'll get your chance to show that you are ready to drive to the hotel.
There was not anything in the closet.
Someone could find the letter and can marry.
Or your sister is lying.
And why should he?
Because I already did.
He went into hiding and lying.
- I believe him.
- Julio, I'm not that naive.
And I know that if you should pick your sister and me, not to think for a minute.
So tell me, you really did not find the letter?
Alicia, is not a choice.
I swore I would never lie to you.
And this is no exception.
I did not find the letter.
And what will you do?
What has my sister should have done long ago.
Forget the damn letter and pretend you never existed.
My sister is still alive.
I have only this is important.
All you have is important.
So why are you still here?
I gather my things and ... and say goodbye.
So you go?
My sister and I are going tomorrow.
Here we are in danger, Alicia, and he and I both.
- I'm sorry.
- Do not worry.
I abide by my word.
Not talking about tomorrow.
Good luck.
- Bethlehem bejöhetek?
- Igen.
- Are you all right?
- What do you think?
Because of the pregnancy, right?
You do not say you feel nauseous.
It did not have.
Are you sick?
Doctor on call.
I do not need a doctor.
Then what happened?
Your mother.
He tried to poison me and the baby, that's happened.
But that's impossible!
My mother would not do that!
Well, while I was perfect, and I did not get him a cup of tea.
And look at me, that I am now.
Ruta was in it.
Abortifacients.
You checked that the gas well is closed?
- Igen, Dona Angela.
- Biztos?
I do not want any trouble because of the gas.
Irene was one of the hotel maid,
One of the gas valve did not close it properly, and when lit, burnt hair.
No eyebrows, no eyelashes are left.
- We had to send.
- Poor.
Remember, Catalina, this is a luxury hotel, not a fairground stall.
The corresponding external essential.
What did Belénnel, my mother?
Catalina, get more water for ironing.
Do not you once more that tone with me!
Especially not in front of others.
- Answer, please.
What did?
- I did not do anything.
Belén said that Rutan made his tea to pull away the child.
- And you believe him rather than your mother?
- Patients with a number Lavoro.
I did not put it in the cup Ruta, but he himself.
- That's ridiculous, my mother.
- Belén meant the Ruta Catalina, but he accidentally drank.
What is the right scripture:
Those who stuck a sword perish by the sword.
That's happened Belénnel.
I do not believe you, mother.
Belén would not do that, ever!
You never liked him, and he just went too far.
Thus, only losing the respect and the love that I feel for you.
Andrew.
Speaking ...
I thought you could use something warm.
- Thank you, I should not have.
- I heard you were sick you are.
I was worried about you and gyerekedért.
Wrong to think what it would have been to lose.
To move yet?
The baby is fine.
It was lucky.
Or maybe not well rue the amount was calculated?
Calm down, I'm not like you, I do not need.
You paid the tettedért, but you know what?
I understand Doña Ángel.
Andrés is a good man and does not deserve anything like you.
Catalina!
Do not you submit this generosity of spirit.
I know well what you want, but neither you, nor your son should not take my place.
Andres, to ask you something.
- Tell me.
- Tomorrow I go to the village,
Free morning, and I think the market is.
Igen, a vasútállomásnál.
Since I do not know Cantaloát, I want someone to accompany you.
I am happy to go, but I never know when I get out.
Then you'll be free, then I ask.
Well, of course, I can go with you.
Thank you very much, Andrés.
Already colors or better.
I brought you some milk.
Oh, I see that preceded Catalina.
Nice girl, is not it?
Feeling lucky to work here.
Especially since he realized that so you can get closer.
You have a crush on you.
Catalina?
No.
That would please him?
Just want to be nice.
You do not see how there alone?
He asked a maid could have also to accompany him to the village.
But he asked for.
I heard.
Do not deny it.
Catalina has no chance.
I just saw you I take.
In addition, I found out that you are pregnant.
- Catalina?
- Igen.
So even more likely to be looking for someone who takes care of the child.
And what's wrong with that?
I am also doing this with you.
The difference is that I love thee.
I reviewed our costs and I think we can improve the nyereségünkön.
It is always gratifying, son.
But never at the expense of quality.
One thing to spend, Alfredo, and other waste.
The latter let the guests.
We can search for new suppliers could reduce the staff and we can change the menu, there are too many kinds of food.
Throw away half of the food or the staff ends up in the abdomen.
I do not know which is worse.
We're Luxury Hotel Javier.
Everything has to be, and in appropriate amounts.
Things are so good, we can not afford to lose our reputation.
Excuse me, Senor Martín García arrived.
Can carry your luggage to your room, I'll accept him.
The problem is that there is no free rooms.
You can see the first fruits of the new director's work.
Don Martín García de Carvajal son and a family friend.
Tell Don Martin to immediately go to receive him.
Igen, Dona Teresa.
Ajánlhatsz to place without having to assess whether there is a vacant room?
Sorry, Doña Teresa, but we have a free room.
I do not think Diego would use his own in the near future.
And it would be a shame to leave it blank.
You're starting to sound like a mask.
Orders to Prepare immediately.
I hope you learned your lesson, son.
And do not make that mistake again.
Next time you control the free rooms, my mother.
Not talking about it.
But to take it to another merit, and lealázzon you.
- Alfredo helper.
- Do not be naive, son.
Alfredo wants your job, and do everything possible to get.
Õ a vetélytársad.
Andrés I am.
Andrew!
Andrés, what are you doing?
Should set an example to others of my son, and you're here: henyélsz and drink.
My mother will not believe this, but I've seen a ghost.
- A ghost?
What nonsense is this?
- Cristina, the maid was gone in.
I've heard rumors that you will be the new director, Don Alfredo.
But I see that is not so.
My husband is the director.
Who actually does the work.
Although my brother boast the title of Director, Don Isidoro,
If you need anything, please contact me directly.
Thank you very much.
At least we got closer to the victory.
My brother will be easier to control than Diego.
What happened, my sister?
It does not seem happy, even though its supposed to be.
Really?
You no longer have to go to Diego.
You are free, just like me.
- Like you, I sure do not.
- Sure.
Now you can choose who you want.
- Enabling mother, yes.
- Have you got the Markijan the family.
What you can do what he wants to have.
What doth hinder me?
Is there someone else?
In love with my sister.
- Who's the lucky one?
- Someone who can not, Javier.
Because it is very rich?
Or because you are poor?
Because there's another woman.
Alicia, I was a lot better and, you know, how many people said yes at first?
Some.
But not all of them.
If you want something, go for it.
- Would not it make sense.
- A failure can not be forgotten.
But do not fight for what you want ... it will forever torment, my sister.
Excuse me, ma'am, but you Doña Ángela looking for.
He says it's urgent.
Ángela, I think something important thing.
I hope that, yes, ma'am.
Cristina Olmedo seen in the hotel.
- Cristina, what are you doing here?
Are you crazy?
- I'm sorry, Julio.
For the letter you from?
You do not trust me?
Have you found?
I was looking for where you hid, and there was nothing.
Yes, Julio, for the letter came.
- Why?
- Because I was afraid to give it to Alicia, and I wanted for myself.
For money, for revenge, I do not know.
But it does not matter.
Now that we do not have, I'm happy.
You were right, man.
I almost died because of it.
And it is not worth it to risk it.
Especially now that we're together again.
Now you have to go.
Yes, but szolgabejárónál étkezõnél in the bustle of people.
I'll get you a festive outfit and you can go to the front door.
But you have to wait here.
Thank you.
Cristina.
Cristina.
You wanted to leave, to even visiting?
Do not go near.
You look good.
Although I have to admit that you were dead right.
- It would be crazy, right?
- You're wrong about me, Cristina.
I'm just trying to protect the mine.
Give me back the letter.
I no longer have power over me.
And you know what?
Actually it made me a favor.
You're the one who hid from before.
And now that caught me ...
I have nothing to hide.
Cristina, wait.
Where is the key?
- Here it is.
- Why did you do that?
Why did you lie to me?
I had to make sure the letter is no longer there.
- You found it?
- I do not.
But everyone already knows about you.
Now I really in danger.
We have to go.
Tomorrow a train going towards Blancard.
Do your job in the hotel and see you on the beach.
Swear to me that you do not move out of the house while Pascual.
- I swear.
- Right.
Do not worry, brother.
Forever we'll go from here.
Javier, I have not seen you around here.
I'm sorry, darling, I'm working the case.
As far as I can.
Javier, I told you not to come here until I bring my money.
This changes things?
Most kit raboltál ki?
- The new director of the Gran Hotel sits before you.
- What happened to your hotel tonight?
Because it was a couple of serves, and drops were nervous.
- I guess because of the unearthed maid.
- What maid?
Cristina Olmedo.
It seems alive.
Did you know?
No ...
Why I knew a maid at your hotel?
How did you obtain this rum?
- Not bad.
- Not bad.
Javier, stop talking nonsense.
Such rum you can not find the hotel.
The best Cuban sugar cane is made.
- And that you can be so cheap?
- Obviously, I'm not in the market.
What if we sold three times the price?
- You want to business with you?
- No no no.
I do not.
The Gran Hotel.
Look, Javier.
I do not mind that you, the Gran Hotel or the King of Spain.
Anyone who goes to play games like this, do not talk about it.
This is the best rum in the world.
But in order to have taken to be little more than money.
Alfredo, no, please.
Ma sem lelhetem örömömet a feleségemben?
More than a month has passed since the accident.
No, because there is not.
But that is now going on.
Cristina Olmedo due cause.
If everyone finds out you're alive,
Diego is released and returns to the hotel.
We can not let that happen.
Doña Teresa, I know it's late, but you are looking phone.
- Yes?
- Do you want this letter?
You know I do.
Gather as much money as you can and look forward to the woods.
- I'm not moving out of the hotel.
- All right.
But I do not go to your room.
- See you there, which is my world.
- The whole hotel is my world.
Tomorrow at 8 o'clock am looking forward to the clothing store.
We'll see how much you are willing to recommend therefore for the letter.
I saw Cristina Olmedo.
Many people have seen the hotel.
But I saw that speaks to you.
The servants' hall.
And what did you hear?
You are asked to give something back.
A letter.
He threatened me.
She said ...
He said something important, affecting the hotel.
But he did not tell us.
He tried to blackmail me, but I did not let him.
- And you do not know what is?
- I do not.
This letter has to do with the disappearance Cristina?
Please, Alicia, I do not know what you're talking about.
My mother, you know, almost never gets nervous, but now.
With titkol elõlem?
You know what really hurts?
You do not believe me.
That's what hurts, Alicia.
I feel that my mother does not trust me, it hurts me.
What is in that letter?
I do not know!
Well, good.
Ayalához I go tomorrow morning.
It's not fair that Diego is in prison for a crime that did not exist.
Of course.
We agreed that we go to the village.
I'm sorry I do not feel like it.
And you know that my fiancee Belén.
I mean, I'm sorry if it bothers you.
Are you okay?
I think I'm going to vomit.
Can I ask a favor?
They made him a medicine against nausea.
Can you get me out of it?
I think we are on the nightstand drawer.
Yes, of course.
From this it will pass once by.
You will be better if you drink, See thou.
- What is it Andres?
- Pharmaceutical.
Against nausea.
Wait, before you drink it.
This lozenge.
He drank too Belén.
Where did you find?
Belén room.
Cristina Olmedo him.
Õszinténszólva I thought that Senor Murquía be the golden knife-murderer and Cristina is one of the victims.
But it is not so.
It is undeniable that Señorita Olmedo was not any murder victim.
Do you know where to now?
- I do not.
- Her brother, Julio, was it?
No.
But I'm sure that when they meet, they go.
Then Julio is still in the vicinity.
- It is only an assumption.
- The.
Alicia.
Señor Murquía, Cristina Olmedo murder accused but last night saw the bride in the hotel.
It's alive.
Señor Murquía quite doubtful that killed that once alive.
Without sacrifice there is no murder.
So, Don Diego, you are free.
Alicia, I told you I was innocent.
And I'm glad that you are proved right.
Did something happen?
Since the arrest of a lot has changed, Diego.
Soon all will be restored.
The point is that I am free, thanks to you.
And I'm glad you're okay and free.
But you should know something.
My mother broke off our engagement.
And many others have changed the hotel.
If there is no obstacle, Don Diego, I would like to accompany you ... to accompany you to the hotel to talk to Doña Teresa.
In addition to the more junior members of the staff he saw my daughter yesterday
Cristina Olmedo around the kitchen.
- And do you know what you doing here?
- I do not.
But stealing a uniform and God knows what else.
I hope that the woman will not cause more damage to the hotel.
If you hear from him again, I would be grateful if you tell me immediately.
It will be a detective.
I leave.
Surely a lot to talk about.
I guess not expected back so soon.
The situation was not very encouraging.
And he never had the virtue of patience.
What did you expect?
I bring food and cigarettes to the jail?
No, of course not.
But I did not expect that one day, without delay,
Alicia terminate my engagement.
I did not expect to sleep with Cristina and Belénnel.
That was before the engagement, Doña Teresa.
Before?
For years, I ask Alicia's hand.
So you respect him?
Szobalányait while taking advantage of the hotel?
I love my daughter.
Well, forget about him, and a hotel.
Not worried about the hotel.
For now.
I see that you are in good hands.
Javier will not disappoint.
Because I know what to expect from it.
- Nothing.
- I trusted you, and disappointed.
Cristina is alive, and he came back, to blackmail by the letter.
And you know that I will not tolerate mistakes.
Doña Teresa, I also know the contents of the letter.
And what is it good for you, if you do not have your letter, my dear?
Nothing.
The accounts are equalized.
And no matter what I said to my daughter, to go into the engagement.
There was never any drop in power, not over me, not over the hotel.
And just because you were director because I wanted it.
And now I do not need you.
Get behind.
- So it was not a ghost.
- It was not a ghost.
Everyone is talking about it.
And I was not the only one who thought he was seeing a ghost.
And where is he now?
It is waiting for me.
It is better if no one knows about it, Andrés.
- Tell her I'm sorry about what happened.
- What do you mean?
He will understand, and if he wants to tell, but it is not easy to choose between a friend and from the one you love.
I see.
I did not expect to find a friend here, Andrés.
But now that I had found my sister, I have to go.
Here, we would not be happy after what happened ....
You can not do this to me.
Twice.
Come here.
Can I find out what you're doing in this room?
This is my room.
Your room?
If you have trouble with something, talk to the manager, Don Javier Alarcónnal.
He lost his study and bedroom in one night.
Believe me, that would receive better treatment in prison.
- I thought he was gone.
- I do not.
Here forgot my hat.
Alicia!
- Julio.
Ayala is investigating at the hotel.
- I know.
And what are you still doing here?
Just I came to say goodbye.
You're going?
I received my salary.
And my sister is waiting on the shore.
You said: you do not do here.
July, nem ...
Alicia, I just wanted to say hello.
Without you I would never have found it Cristina.
You trusted me, even though I lied to kilétemrõl.
- Julio Molins.
Architect.
- Look at me.
I'm still not serving food.
No one I'm Alicia.
Ever since I put my foot into the hotel, only twisted shape in trouble.
You risked his life to help me, and I've never done one thing for me.
I want to believe that you're in my position would have done.
My mother broke off the engagement Diego.
I'm happy.
While Diego was innocent, not a good man.
And you never loved.
You can find someone better ....
Yes.
And you've found the woman of your life.
- What do you mean?
- Cristina.
If only a man would do anything for me than what you've done for him.
God be with you, Alicia.
Congratulations.
Diego.
There are no longer welcome here.
Enjoy it while you can, because my job is retrieved.
And everybody slides back in.
Your place is already on the street.
Not for long.
Sometimes things do not work, Alfredo.
This is important so you know what to do to fix them.
Miss Alicia.
Julio had left it in his room, but do not know where he went.
Maybe he said.
- Already gone.
- And you do not know where?
I will miss you, right?
At least for me.
A common room you can better understand someone, you know?
In general, I feel lucky that I can work here, but sometimes I want to be like him, without the strings attached.
I also want to live without constraints.
I thought, there are no limitations.
His mother broke off the engagement.
Do you think you have come back?
Miss Alicia.
You just have to ask, and I'll stay.
I can not do that.
I thought I would not do it, but what you want.
Andrew.

Get back.
And your husband will be director of the hotel.
Ruta trying to poison Catalina.
The mother wanted to poison me.
- I'm sorry about what happened, Andrés.
- Nothing happened.
I only did because I wanted to protect Catalinától.
He manipulates you.

I do not understand.
What are you doing here Cristina?
It should have never come here.
Neither him nor me.
And if anyone doubts have been Regarding the holding of wedding ...
I know you, Alicia.
Your heart is already someone else's.
A good place to leave the area.
Believe me, I've seen many times, and always have to end badly.
Catalina saw Cristina's body.
And you know, that was no accident.
If you are going to babble, our family could be in big trouble.

"Immediately arrest and hand over to justice."
I'm not going anywhere until then, while I do not know out who killed my sister.
- I think there's something else.
- One more thing?
There may be some other reason not go away.
Do not talk nonsense.
You've done you a favor, and I pay for it.
But I do not need the child.
Those who have been brought up, withdrew.
It's called the Ruta plant.
Two spoonfuls is enough to get rid of the kid .

To move the matter forward, you will need that person's testimony ,
With the most data, and we both know who they are.

The confession is synonymous with freedom loss.
I do not fear the loss of freedom , Alicia.
The main witness working at the hotel, and 6 am, will testify before the judge.
- Kill.
- How will I know who it is?
It will start from the hotel at a quarter to five.

GRAN HOTEL Part 7:
The Stolen Letters
Someone hit me when I went there when...
.
And done your job?
Almost, sir, but I could not finish.
I very much regret having been knocked out, Garrido, but...
We can not leave things pending.
What are you going to do?
Talk with Benjamin and find out who missed the briefing, I asked,
Retain it.
If you already know who it is, do it ,
Do not do that again set foot in the hotel.
Yes, sir.
Dismiss an employee for being absent a briefing?
Hernando, discipline is essential.
And what do you do if someone really make a mistake?
Kills?
What are you talking...
I hope that no one saw us .
And the bloody clothes?
And the anonymous letters?
I thought you were dead.
I'm sorry.
Everyone thinks you're dead.
The Supervisory Board.
I think I killed like the other woman.
It is better if we continue to believe this.
Why?
For many people wanted him dead.
I discovered something.
Something that could mean the end of the Gran Hotel.
The first months were very hard.
I worked all week,
So I could hardly save, our mother to be sent.
You do not think you none?
My family needs the money into it.
You also need it.
Of course, only if you do not want the whole spend your life for this hotel.
The pride is a bad adviser, Cristina
Right now and you sit next to him.
My dad worked in a vineyard for 20 years.
Age of 30, he could barely walk straight ,
Her skin charred,
Lucky and felt if you slept more than four hours at night.
We did not sleep much anymore.
The salary should be accommodation and food.
What was a very serious matter, Belén.
If Doña Teresa is doing so, should pay ,
Instead of payment for to work at the Grand Hotel.
Do what you want, but I do not want to stay here and to end up like him.
Alone, desperate, homeless.
Actually it was happening right in Him.
Doña Ángela Whatever you say, so much money for nothing was enough.
Therefore, when Sebastián, a pub owner cantaloai
Things earned money offered at the hotel, I said yes.
true.
You stole.
A couple of bottles of wine, cigarettes, liquor, perfume ,
Things that never would have missed them.
Do you know how many clothes you Señorita Alarcónnak?
How many perfume?
No, Julio.
He does not know.
Never going to miss him.
One evening, when old Don Carlos 's study analyzed buried a bottle
I found something.
Who told you to clean up Don Diego study?
Because I do not remember that I had been .
It was the express wish of Madam, Don Diego.
You can ask him.
I do not think that would be required.
If I do, it would mean that I think you're lying to me.
Go to the clothing store and put it to all the tablecloths out to be hardened.
Doña Pilar Hermida daughter only once introduced in the company.
And even though you do not understand what this means, I will not be responsible for the disaster.
Yes, ma'am.
Do not know who hid there I write, Julio
But as soon as I read, I knew it was worthwhile.
Why?
What was it?
Something that makes you lose Doña Teresa the hotel.
- What did you do with the letter?
- I hid.
Our rooms are not secure.
And if someone had found it,
I did not want to find out to do with the letter.
My daughter, this is the key to the cellar.
Alfredo Choose a good wine, not thinking about the price.
The Prince should pay particular attention.
Do not worry, mom.
I have an idea when Doña Teresa room cleaned.
A copy of the closet preserves hotel each key.
Guests are Safe Deposit...
But I have found a safer place .
Stacks of gold The cabinet rarely opened, and you only do Benjamín.
Doña Teresa never miss the key.
But then I made a mistake.
Bad man I trusted you.
I have to go back to Madrid in a few weeks.
So you will not have to be hiding.
I do not think I stay in the hotel until .
You go to?
Do you think you can find something better?
've Found it.
Been working in the room.
I do not know what you're talking about, Cristina.
Well... about something that may interest you.
We could also half.
I've never had to go.
I'm sure that he was betrayed.
We both know that you've got something that belongs to me.
In the meantime do not go away from here, as long as you do not give back.
If you do something with me, everyone learns the truth and you lose the hotel.
- Are you threatening me?
- Understand the way you want.
Then I realized that only one thing can I do : the run for weeks.
If you want to take my daughter get back what is mine.
And I did that night.
Festival of Lights.
While everyone was at the ceremony, I went back to my room.
But someone followed.
I ran into the garden, and then I saw someone even in the shadows.
I could not see his face, but it was a golden knife him.
And the light paralyzed.
And that's why...
Diego caught.
Where is the letter?
- Give it to me!
- No!
Diego is in prison.
The on charges of the murder.
And because of all the other women.
Well, they are wrong, Julio.
Diego despicable figure.
But he is not killing the golden knife.
Who is it?
I do not know.
I could barely see for a moment.
While it has not gotten Diego.
I thought he was dead.
Pascual smoke came out and saw that Diego persecuted me.
As soon as he was alone, he pulled out of the water.
Cristina.
Return to yourself, please.
Return to yourself, for God's sake.
Do not do this to me.
Groomed almost a month I thought it would never be built up.
I was feverish, and talked away.
And if he does not, I would have died.
The first action was to go to my room ,
And bring the gold key Stacks of cabinet.
I have kept in my room under the floor.
But it was not there.
And none of the photos, which have kept there, Julio.
- Someone took everything.
- I think I know who it was.
- I.
- You have the key?
In my room.
When I started to work at the hotel,
I knew something was wrong with you.
And the first thing he had to search the room.
And then there was the key.
I was sure that the key has to do with being missing.
Why did you want to get the letter?
Almost died because of it.
I could not let that remain in this respect.
So I hated Diego, that I decided my zeal.
And I pull out of it as much money as enough to escape Pascuallal.
And my only chance was if him into believing I was dead.
And that someone knows what you did to me .
Yes?
I hope the money has been initialized.
You better be accurate.
But the day I had to Pascualnak reach the money, time almost stood.
Pascual...
I knew that something had happened to him.
I saw him when he died.
And the last time I said, how much he loves you.
The next day was a burglar in the house.
I could not let that take away my things, therefore knocked and ran.
- I hit it with all my strength.
- I understand.
And it is strong, since they do not dare to come back .
Should have seen him, my brother.
I can imagine.
I took my Holm
And I had to give the Monte de Piedade the only valuable:
A piece of jewelry I gave Diego.
I started Nyomorogni.
Or starve, or recover that damn letter.
I wanted to do when I saw you, as soon as you leave the hotel.
I cut your way to receive signals, and I saw a man who wanted to shoot you down.
Did you see who it was?
Garrido, Diego right hand.
Testify... because of the death against Diego I started.
I Garrido wanted to stop it.
What was that?
Someone outside.
Alicia!
What are you doing here?
I could not stand to testify, and followed you.
Cristina?
It's alive?
No one knows it.
Diego is in prison because of meggyilkolásoddal suspected.
Excuse me, miss, but do not regret Don Diego.
Spend the remaining days Faces behind bars.
- The võlegényemrõl about.
- You testified against yourself.
Because I thought you were dead Cristina, Diego fault.
But I was wrong.
Not killed, but he wanted.
If it is up, the Gran Hotel lake tab.
They wanted to set aside, at any cost.
Wanted?
Who?
The Grand Hotel nothing happens without the permission of Doña Teresa.
Accusing my mother planned to murder?
This is crazy.
- Alicia, listen to me.
- No, listen to me, Julio!
A murder accused to the võlegényemet I did not commit.
Ayalával need to talk.
Alicia!
Alicia, wait, please.
Do not talk Ayalával.
Why?
Diego did not kill your sister, Pascual also told.
Why he wanted to do anything my mother Cristina?
He is the head Gran Hotel.
If you do not want a maid, you only have to provide it.
I could not.
My sister discovered something about your family, Alicia.
What makes your mother may lose the hotel.
In a letter to.
Diego and mother knew that Cristinánál and wanted to get back there.
Therefore Diego followed during the Light Festival, and therefore wanted to kill him.
If your sister is telling the truth and doing justice Ayala.
- You can not prove it.
- You want to can you believe that?
How can you want me to believe you to your sister?
I can find the letter and prove it.
But please do not tell anyone that you saw my sister .
Drifting in trouble, and me too.
Rámlõtt Garrido, because I wanted to testify against Diego.
And if it were not to hide Diego, Alicia,
Not care that I make a confession.
I do not believe your sister, Julia.
Give you a day.
Ayalával talking about tomorrow.
- You let him go?
- It will not say anything.
- Julio!
- Trust me.
I believe you, but he did not.
I do not know what , you do not know the Alarcónokat.
- Alicia is not like the others.
- Alicia...
So you call Señorita Alarcónt?
My friend helped me find you.
Thanks to them that I'm here.
Fall in love?
I know you, brother.
Fell in love and always those who do not fit you.
Not talked to him about the letter ?

Where is the letter?
Where are you hide?
If he will score it destroys.
It, however, can be valuable.
A lot of money we can get him and take our revenge on them .
Barely know you, Cristina.
The theft love, blackmail, lies...
You were not like that.
You were good and kind.
They made me this way.
The Alarcónok and damned Hotel.
It is therefore necessary to regain the letter.
Recovers.
But I will give to the police.
If you want me to pay for the crime of , it's the only way.
Where is the letter?
The golden knife cabinet.
Second account, during the dinner service.
Wait here.
Coming soon.
Raise your glasses, toast our future of the hotel,
And Alfredo Vergarára and Sofía Alarcónra.
The first grandchild's parents.
Ma'am.
Sir.
Thank you very much.
Alicia, you're late.
Where have you been?
I walked only one.
What happened?
Our mother has just announced that Alfredo will be the director of the hotel.
I know that your fiancee Diego, and I'm sorry, but...
Mother can not trust others, who has committed a murder.
- It was not a judgment, Sofía.
- Now you defending him?
I just hope that we can see the truth.
- Alfredo, congratulations.
- Thank you, Alicia.
- I'm very proud of you, my love.
- Thank you, my dear.
Thanks to you and your children I am the happiest man in the world.
- Something happened, Sofía?
- Sure a lot of excitement.
Tired true, my daughter?
Yes.
If you'll excuse me.
Doña Teresa, I assure you it will not repent .
I not voluntarily chose you, my dear .
You know was not much choice.
If you'll excuse me.
Mother, I want to know what's going on Diego.
- Ayala agent takes care of everything.
- I understand our engagement.
After what happened it is better to decompose.
I happy about it.
Do not say I did feel something Diego for.
It was my fiancée, now in prison.
Not exactly a welcome situation.
Mother, I need to talk to you.
Important.
What's so important?
My mother did not want to be anymore West.
I promise I will not...
I swear that there are no more problems ,
And now I want to take responsibility for the family.
And the hotel management.
I understand the distrust, but I decided to change.
And I ask, when you bring this amazing the decision?
I met with General and Doña Mercedes-winds when they left.
Although Eugenia was not sane,
I know that he died because of me.
And your sister is almost and...
A duel, when... when I saw the way the general mean me...
Everything changed.
Since years trying to steer the right path.
Maybe I should have to grab a gun, megértessem to myself.
I am determined, my mother.
What would you do in my place, Javier?
There are so many reasons you gave me not to trust you to
It would be understandable if you do not believe me.
Give me a chance, just one.
I know that my father and you were always
I wanted to be a Alarcón manage the hotel.
The dance begins at 9 am, so I 8 pm levied off the tables.
The Waltz dance the American style, open-figures ,
So many places will be needed.
- Take this into consideration.
- Yes, Benjamín do.
Sorry, Benjamín do.
I would like to know whether someone missed the briefing.
Yes.
He missed one serving.
Julio Espinosa.
Julio, what are you doing here?
I thought you were gone.
Something happened.
I do not know what happened or what did you do , but
I wanted to do when I say Benajamínnak, to left, appeared Garrido,
Don Diego helper, and inquired about.
- Faces?
- Well, not exactly,
But he wanted to know who missed the briefing .
Perfect.
Put into place.
Sad, Alicia, you see.
Do not look like image.
I've known you since my childhood, and I know that is because Diego.
- That's right, Lady.
- Very beautiful and rich.
Like me.
But younger.
Will be no shortage seekers.
- Thank you very much.
- Cheer up, my daughter.
Now what do you want, Julio?
Alicia important thing happened.
- Espinosa.
- Yes sir?
Stay with me.
- Here's Senor Garrido.
- Thanks.
- How can I help?
- Walk with me.
Come on.
Julio, thank you for helping me in the afternoon decoration.
Don Benjamín forgive me that I booked one of the waiters ,
Diego but the absence of all of us must work together .
All right, Señorita Alarcón.
- The Miss was in the afternoon?
- Yes.
- I said, Garrido, I have a problem?
- No.
- Where should I come with her?
- Anywhere.
No longer need.
- Thank you very much.
- I helped you
But I want you to do something in return .
Find the letter and bring it to me.
Finally occupy the place we deserve .
Yes, of course.
Uncle Don Ernesto García de Carvajal for
Always be room in the hotel.
Yes.
Perfect, see you soon.
Bye for now.
I ask, what are you doing here, Javier?
- I did not tell my mother?
- What?
You stand in front of the hotel's new Director.
What is it?
've Forgotten the basic politeness as well?
Javier behaves as if it were his manager of the hotel.
Because he's the new hotel manager.
- This is impossible!
- Javier irresponsible mother.
In the hotel only recognizes the maids rooms.
And the wine cellar.
Therefore, it becomes the deputy director Alfredo.
But a few hours ago he was appointed Director of the hotel .
No, my dear.
I did not use this word.
I trust the fate of the hotel.
As Deputy Director.
Javier give his name, and you Institute of affairs and supervise the work.
- So I'll Javier nanny.
- Call it whatever you want.
- It is not fair, Mother.
- Life is not fair, my love.
You, as a woman, you should know.
And you'll get chance to show, that you are ready to drive to the hotel.
There was not anything in the closet.
Someone could find the letter, and can marry.
Or nurse lying.
Why should he?
Because it already did.
He went into hiding and lying.
- I believe him.
- Julio, I'm not that naive.
And I know that you and your sister should pick me ,
Not think for one minute.
So tell me, really not found the letter?
Alicia, is not a choice.
I swore I would never lie to you .
And this is no exception.
I did not find the letter.
What are you going to do?
What my sister had long ago should have done.
Forget that damn letter and to look as if it had never existed.
My sister is alive.
I have only this is important.
Only is this important to you.
Why are you still here?
Gather my things and...
and say goodbye.
So you go?
My sister and I are going tomorrow.
Here we are in danger, Alicia, he and I both.
- I'm sorry.
- Do not worry.
I abide by my word.
Not talking about tomorrow.
Good luck.
- Belén, come in?
- Yes.
- Are you all right?
- What do you think?
Due to pregnancy are you?
You did not say to feel nauseous.
It did not have.
Sick?
Doctor on call.
I do not need a doctor.
So what happened?
Your mother.
He tried to poison me and a little bit, that's happened.
But that's impossible!
My mother would not do that!
Well, until I was perfectly while I did not get him a cup of tea.
And look at me, that I am now.
Ruta was in it.
Abortifacients.
Verified that the gas well it is closed?
- Yes, Doña Ángela.
- Sure?
I do not want any trouble because of the gas.
Irene one of the hotels was maid
One gas valve did not close properly at , and when lit,
Burnt hair.
No eyebrows, no eyelashes are left.
- We had to send.
- Poor.
Remember, Catalina, this is a luxury hotel, not a fairground stall .
The corresponding external essential.
What did Belénnel, my mother?
Catalina, get more water for ironing.
Do not you dare even once such a tone talk to me!
Especially not in front of others.
- Answer, please.
What did?
- I did not do anything.
Belén said that Rutan made the tea to pull away the child.
- And you believe him rather than your mother?
- Sick, many with a basin.
I did not put it in the cup Ruta, but he himself.
- This is ridiculous, my mother.
- Belén the Ruta Catalina meant,
But he accidentally drank.
What is the right Scripture:
Those who stuck a sword perish by the sword.
That's happened Belénnel.
I do not believe you, mother.
Belén would not do that, ever!
You never liked him, and just went too far.
Only way to lose the respect and the love I feel for you.
Andrés.
I am.
I thought you could use something warm .
- Thank you, I should not have.
- I heard you were sick you are.
I was worried about you and gyerekedért.
Bad to think what would have to lose .
To move yet?
The child is fine.
It was lucky.
Or maybe not well- amount was calculated on the ruta?
Calm down, I'm not like you, do not need it.
You paid the tettedért, but you know what?
I understand Doña Ángel.
Andrés good man, and not one that deserves like you.
Catalina!
Do not submit at this a generosity of spirit.
I know well what you want, but neither you, nor your son not take my place.
Andrés, to ask you something.
- Tell.
- Tomorrow I go to the village
Morning is free, and I think the market is .
Yes, the train station.
Because I do not know Cantaloát, I want someone to accompany you.
I am happy to go, but I never know when I get out .
You'll be free, then I ask.
Well, of course, I can go with you.
Thank you very much, Andrés.
Already colors or better.
I brought you some milk.
Oh, I see that preceded Catalina.
Ordinary girl, is not it?
Feels lucky to be working here.
Especially since we realized that such get closer to you.
I like you.
Catalina?
No.
That would please him?
I just want to be nice.
You do not see how there alone?
Could would ask a maid too, to accompany him to the village.
But he asked for.
I heard.
Do not deny it.
Catalina no chance.
I just saw you I take.
In addition, I found out she was pregnant.
- Catalina?
- Yes.
So even likely to be looking for someone who takes care of the child.
What's wrong with that?
That's what I will do to you.
The difference is that I love thee.
I reviewed our costs and I think we can improve the nyereségünkön.
It is always gratifying, son.
But never at the expense of quality.
One thing to spend, Alfredo, and other waste .
The latter let the guests.
We can search for new suppliers could reduce the staff ,
And we can change the menu are too many kinds of food.
Or throw away half of the food ends up in the belly of the staff.
I do not know which is worse.
Luxury Hotel, Javier.
All need to be and the corresponding amounts.
Things are so good, we not lose our reputation.
Excuse me, Senor Martín García arrived.
Can be applied to the package to his room, immediately accept him.
The problem is that there is no free rooms.
You can see the first fruits of the new director's work .
Don Martín García de Carvajal, son of and a family friend.
Tell Don Martino, to immediately go to receive him.
Yes, Doña Teresa.
How ajánlhatsz place without assess whether there is a vacant room?
Sorry, Doña Teresa, but we have a free room.
I do not think Diego would use his own in the near future.
And it would be a pity to leave it blank.
You're starting to sound like a mask.
Orders to Prepare immediately.
I hope you learned your lesson, son.
And do not make that mistake again.
Next control in the rooms available, my mother.
Not what I'm talking about.
But to take it to another merit and lealázzon you.
- Alfredo a helper.
- Do not be naive, son.
Alfredo wants your job, and doing everything to take.
It is the rival.
Andrés, I am.
Andrés!
Andrés, what are you doing?
My son should set an example to the others
You're here: henyélsz and drink.
My mother will not believe, but I've seen a ghost.
- Ghost?
What nonsense is this?
- Cristina, the maid was gone in.
I heard a rumor that you are going to the new director, Don Alfredo.
But I see that is not so.
My husband is the deputy director.
Anyone who actually does the work.
Although my brother boast the title of Director, don Isidoro,
If you need anything, , please contact me directly.
Thank you very much.
At least closer to victory.
My brother will be easier to control, as Diego .
What is it, little sister?
I do not look happy, even though its supposed to be.
Really?
You do not need to go to Diego.
You're free, just like me.
- Like you, I sure do not.
- Sure.
Now you can choose who you want.
- Enabling mother, yes.
- He got the Markijan the family.
What you can do what he wants to have.
What inhibits us?
Is there someone else?
In love with my sister.
- Who's the lucky one?
- Someone who can not, Javier.
Because it is very rich?
Or because you are poor?
Because there's another woman.
Alicia, I was a lot better and, you know, how many people said yes at first?
Some.
But not all of them.
If you want something, go for it .
- Would not it make sense.
- A failure can not be forgotten.
But you do not fight for what you want...
it will forever torment, my sister.
I'm sorry, ma'am, but you Doña Ángela looking for.
He says it's urgent.
Ángela, I think something important thing.
I hope that, yes, ma'am.
Cristina Olmedo seen in the hotel.
- Cristina, what are you doing here?
Are you crazy?
- I'm sorry, Julio.
For the letter you from?
You do not trust me?
Have you found?
I was looking for where you hid, and there was nothing.
Yes, Julio, I came for the letter.
- Why?
- I was afraid to give it to Alicia,
Myself and I wanted to do.
For money, for revenge, I do not know.
But no matter.
Now that you no longer have , I'm happy.
You were right, brother.
Almost died because of it.
And it is not worth it to risk it.
Especially now that we're together again.
You have to go.
Yes, but szolgabejárónál étkezõnél in the bustle of people.
I'll get you a festive outfit and you can go to the front door.
But you have to wait here.
Thank you.
Cristina.
Cristina.
You wanted to leave, not even to visiting?
Do not zoom.
You look good.
Although I have to admit, it is better to were dead.
- It would be crazy, right?
- You're wrong about me, Cristina.
I'm just trying to protect the mine.
Add to that letter.
I have no power over me.
And you know what?
Actually favor to me.
I'm the one who hid from before.
And now that caught me...
I have nothing to hide .
Cristina, wait.
Where is the key?
- Here it is.
- Why did you do that?
Why did you lie to me?
I had to make sure that the letter no longer there.
- You found it?
- No.
But everyone already knows about you.
I really in danger.
We have to go.
Tomorrow a train going towards Blancard.
Do your job at the hotel, we meet and the beach.
Swear to me that you do not move out until Pascual's house.
- I swear.
- Correct.
Do not worry, brother.
Forever we go from here.
Javier, long time no see you around here.
I'm sorry, darling, I'm working the case.
As far as I can.
Javier, I told you not to come here, until you bring my money.
That changes things?
Now who raided?
- The new director of the Gran Hotel sits before you.
- What happened to your hotel tonight?
Because I was serving a few, and there were bit nervous.
- I guess because of the unearthed maid.
- What maid?
Cristina Olmedo.
It seems alive.
Did you know?
I do not...
Why they knew a maid at your hotel?
How do you obtain this rum?
- Not bad.
- Not bad.
Javier, do not talk nonsense.
In this rum you can not find the hotel.
The best Cuban sugar cane is made.
- And that you can be so cheap?
- Obviously I'm not in the market.
What if we sold three times the price?
- You want to business with you?
- No no no.
I do not.
The Gran Hotel.
Look, Javier.
I do not mind that you, the Gran Hotel, or the King of Spain.
Anyone who goes to play games like this, not talk about it.
This is the best rum in the world.
But in order to have taken a little more should be like money.
Alfredo, no, please.
Today my wife nor my happiness be found?
More than a month has passed since the accident.
No, because there is not.
But that is now going on .
Due to Cristina Olmedo affairs.
If everyone finds out she's alive,
Released Diego, and return to the hotel.
We can not let that happen.
Doña Teresa, I know it's late, but phone you are looking for.
- Yes?
- You want this letter?
You know I do.
Gather as much money as he can and look forward to the woods.
- Not move out of the hotel.
- All right.
But I do not go to your room.
- See you there, which is my world.
- The entire hotel is my world.
Tomorrow at 8 o'clock am looking forward to the clothing store.
Let's see how much you are willing to therefore recommend for the letter.
I saw Cristina Olmedo.
Many people have seen the hotel.
But I saw that speaks to you.
The servant's hall.
And what did you hear?
You are asked to give something back.
A letter.
Threatened.
He said...
He said something important affecting the hotel.
But it did not tell us.
Tried to blackmail me, but I did not let him.
- And you do not know what is?
- No.
This letter has to do with the disappearance Cristina?
Please, Alicia, I do not know what you're talking about .
My mother, you know, almost never will be nervous, but now.
What are you hiding from me?
You know what really hurts?
What you do not believe me.
That's what hurts, Alicia.
I feel that my mother does not trust me, it hurts me.
What's in the letter?
I do not know!
Well, good.
Ayalához I leave tomorrow morning.
It's not fair that Diego is a sin prison, which does not exist.
Course.
We agreed that we go to the village.
I'm sorry I do not feel like it.
And you know Belén fiancee.
I understand, I'm sorry if it bothers you.
Are you all right?
I think I'm going to vomit.
Can I ask a favor?
Place in Him there is a medicine against nausea .
Can you get me out of it?
I think the bedside table drawer is .
Yes, of course.
From that one hit will pass.
You will be better if you drink, See thou.
- What is it Andrés?
- Pharmaceutical.
Against nausea.
Wait, before you drink it.
It ruta.
It also drank Belén.
Where did you find?
Belén room.
Cristina Olmedo live.
Õszinténszólva I thought that Senor Murquía be the golden knife killer
Cristina and one of the victims.
But it is not so.
It is undeniable that Señorita Olmedo was not a victim of any kind of murder.
Do you know where to now?
- No.
- The younger brother, Julio, was it?
No.
But be sure to when they meet, they go.
Julio You can still nearby.
- It's only an assumption.
- In.
Alicia.
Murquía Señor, you Cristina Olmedo murder accused
But last night the bride seen in the hotel.
It's alive.
Señor Murquía, it is quite doubtful that killed that once alive.
No murder without a victim.
So, don Diego, you are free.
Alicia, I told you I was innocent.
I am glad that you are proved right.
Has something happened?
Since his arrest much it has changed Diego.
'll Be all restored.
The point is that I'm Thanks to you free.
And we're glad you're okay and free.
But something you should know.
My mother broke off our engagement.
And many others have also changed the hotel.
If there is no impediment to don Diego, I would like to accompany you...
Accompany you to the hotel to talk to Doña Teresa.
In addition to the youngest daughter of the staff member saw yesterday more
Cristina Olmedo around the kitchen.
- You know what you doing here?
- No.
But stealing a uniform and God knows what else.
I hope that the woman will not cause more damage the hotel.
If you hear from him again, I'd be grateful if immediately communicated to me.
It will be a detective.
Leaves.
Certainly a lot to talk about.
I guess not expected back so soon.
The situation was not very encouraging.
And it never was the virtue of patience.
What did you expect?
I bring food and cigarettes to the jail?
No, of course not.
But I did not expect that one day, without delay
Alicia terminate my engagement.
I did not expect to go to bed Cristina and Belénnel.
That was before the engagement, Doña Teresa.
Before?
For years, ask me Alicia's hand.
So you respect him?
To take advantage of the hotel during szobalányait?
I love my daughter.
Well, forget about him, and the hotel.
Not worried about the hotel.
For now.
I see that you are in good hands.
Javier will not disappoint.
Because I know what to expect from him.
- Nothing.
- I trusted you, and disappointed.
Cristina is alive, and he came back
Blackmail with that letter.
And I know that I will not tolerate mistakes.
Doña Teresa, I know contents of the letter.
And what is it good for you, if you do not have letter, my dear?
Nothing.
The accounts are equalized.
And no matter what I said to my daughter, to go into the engagement.
I've never had any drop in power over me no, not over the hotel.
And just because you were director because I wanted it.
And now I do not need you.
Get behind.
- So it was not a ghost.
- It was not a ghost.
Everyone talks about it.
And I was not the only one who he thought he saw a ghost.
Where is he now?
Waiting for me.
It is better if no one knows about it, Andrés .
- Tell her I'm sorry about what happened.
- What do you mean?
He will understand, and if you want to tell me
But it is not easy to choose between a friendly between and the one you love.
I see.
I did not expect to find here friend, Andrés.
But now that I had found my sister, I have to go.
We would not be happy after what happened to the...
.
You can not do this to me.
Even twice.
Come here.
Can I find out what are you doing in this room?
This is my room.
Your room?
If you have trouble with something, talk to the manager , Don Javier Alarcónnal.
He lost his study and bedroom overnight.
Assure you that the prison would receive better treatment.
- I thought you had left.
- No.
Here forgot my hat.
Alicia!
- Julio.
Ayala is investigating the hotel.
- I know.
What are you still doing here?
I came just to say goodbye.
Already you are going?
I received the payment.
And my sister is waiting on the shore.
You said: you do not do here.
Julio, no...
Alicia, I just wanted to say hello.
Without you, I never would have found it Cristina.
You trusted me, even though I lied to the kilétemrõl .
- Julio Molins.
Architect.
- Look at me.
I'm still not serving food.
I'm Nobody, Alicia.
Ever since I put my foot into the hotel, only twisted shape trouble.
Risked his life to help, and such a thing had never made one for me.
I want to believe that you're in my position would have done .
My mother broke off the engagement Diego.
I'm happy.
While Diego was innocent, not a good man.
And you never loved.
... Now you can find someone better.
Yes.
And you've found the woman of your life .
- What do you mean?
- Cristina.
If only a man would do anything for me, like what you've done for him.
God be with you, Alicia.
Congratulations.
Diego.
There are no longer welcome here.
Enjoy it while you can, because regains the job.
And everybody slides back in.
Your place is already on the street.
Not for long.
Sometimes things do not work , Alfredo.
The important so it knows what to do to fix them .
Señorita Alicia.
Julio left it in his room, but do not know where he went.
Maybe he said.
- Already gone.
- And I do not know where?
I will miss you, right?
At least for me.
A common room to be better to know someone, you know?
In general, I feel lucky that I can work at ,
But sometimes I want to be like him, without constraints.
I also want to live without constraints.
I thought, there are no limitations.
To his mother he opened the engagement.
Do you think it still comes back?
Señorita Alicia.
Should just ask and I'll stay.
You can not do that.
I thought I would not do that, I need, but what you want.
Andrés.
The sequel to...
- Ma'am, I heard a cry.
- Call up the entire staff
- In the dining room.
- Something happened?
Get a hold of immediately a piece can not be left on the ground.
've Been down here, right?
Do you know what happened.
- What do you want in exchange for the letter?
- Get back what was mine!
Diego is where he is because he's got the...
leaf.
Get back.
And your husband will be director of the hotel.
Trying to poison Catalina Rutan.
He wanted to poison your mother.
- I'm sorry about what happened, Andrés.
- Nothing happened.
I only did because I wanted to protect Catalinától .
He manipulates you.
- My sister.
- Died.
I do not understand.
What are you doing here Cristina?
It never should have come here.
Neither him nor me.
And if anyone doubts have been keeping Regarding the wedding...
I know you, Alicia.
Your heart is already someone else's.
Good place to leave the area.
Believe me, I've seen many times, and always has been wrong end .
Saw Cristina Catalina's body.
And you know, that was no accident.
If you are going to babble, our family could be in big trouble.
Previously on...
I wanna get things right this time.
Bree's relationship with detective Vance got serious.
What are we gonna say to people?
Tom and Lynette decided to separate.
We shouldn't tell anyone until we tell the kids.
Oh, god.
The kids.
Sit down.
Ow!
Gaby's stepfather returned to terrorize her again...
I remember those nights in your room, baby.
No!
Stop.
Until Carlos stopped him... permanently.
Gaby?
What happened?
- I killed him.
- And now he's gonna go to jail because he was trying to protect me.
Calm down.
We just need time to think.
We don't have time.
Yes, there was the dinner party.
Everybody's coming.
Including your boyfriend the detective.
I killed the son of a bitch who hurt my wife.
If I have to go to prison, I will.
That's not gonna happen.
Every hostess knows there's work to be done after the guests leave a party.
And only the best of friends will stay long after the party's over... to help clean up the mess.
They help with the heavy lifting... they work together to lighten the load.
They take on the most unpleasant tasks.
And, of course, there's no task more unpleasant than getting rid of an unwanted guest.
I should go move the car off the trail.
You gonna be okay?
Is this happening?
Are we really doing this?
Everyone stay focused.
The hardest part is over.
Now all we have to do is fill this in.
Oh, my god.
I thought I got everything.
No.
No, you missed the phone.
And if you missed that, what else did you miss?
Susan, it's gonna be okay.
How is it going to be okay?
Someone is calling the dead guy.
- "Home."
- See?
He has a home... with people who care about him, people who are going to come looking for him, leading them straight to us.
What do you want us to do?
It's not too late.
We... we could still go to the police.
And send my husband back to prison?
This time for murder?
No, not necessarily.
It was self-defense.
He broke into your house.
He threatened you.
We could explain that.
Yeah, then we can explain how we dumped him in a trunk, ate some cheesecake, and buried him in the woods!
We are going to get caught.
People always get caught.
We can't do this.
We're not criminals.
We drive carpool.
That's enough.
This is a very bad man.
He attacked our friend, and her husband protected her, and now we are gonna protect them.
That means we tell no one.
Not the police... not our families.
No one.
When we bury the body, we bury the secret forever.
Susan?
Yes, it's only the best of friends who stay long after the party's over to help clean up the mess...
Even when that mess may be bigger than they bargained for.
It has been said that change doesn't happen overnight, but over the course of month, it's amazing how much the ground can shift beneath us.
A woman who helped conceal a crime is now sleeping with a detective.
A man who used to look forward to bedtime... is now finding himself dreading it.
A woman who once told her husband everything is now keeping a terrible secret.
And a couple who have decided to separate is now going to great lengths to show that nothing has changed.
Crap!
Crap!
Crap!
Crap!
Aah!
Son of a...
Hey, hey, hey, guys!
Got up early, so I figured, what the heck?
I'll go get your mom some coffee...
the good stuff.
She deserves it.
She needs it, too.
I didn't sleep last night.
But you would know that.
You were there.
Do not drink this.
It's been in my car for three days.
Where are your shoes, dad?
It's casual friday.
Casual thursday.
Come on.
We're gonna miss the bus.
See ya later.
I'll see ya at dinner.
Love you.
God, I practically lost a toe out there.
It wouldn't have happened if you hadn't overslept.
Yeah, well, you know, you took the good alarm clock along with the good pillow and the house.
This is ridiculous.
We have to tell the kids we've separated.
We will, but this weekend is Gaby's big barbecue, and I don't wanna ruin it for them.
Yeah, and last weekend, you didn't wanna ruin the basketball tournament.
The weekend before that, Penny's birthday.
Come on, Lynette.
Are you sure this is about the kids?
What else would it be?
No, Tom, nothing's changed.
We still need time away from each other.
Yeah, I agree.
We got a lot of problems to work out, so why can't we tell the kids?
I just think they deserve one more happy weekend before we tear this family apart.
You know what?
You're...
Paige is up.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Don't take this the wrong way, but you could do this professionally.
Coming from a man who's on a first-name basis with half the hookers in Fairview, that's quite a compliment, detective.
Hey, I was thinking maybe this weekend, we could head up to that place in the mountains, just the two of us.
Oh, that sounds lovely, but Gaby is having her annual barbecue on saturday.
Am I invited?
Of course you are.
Why wouldn't you be?
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe because your friends don't like me.
What?
You are imagining things.
It's true.
They don't talk to me.
They don't make eye contact.
It's been that way for weeks, ever since the night of the dinner party.
Why...
Uh, why would you say that?
Bree, I'm a cop.
I got an eye for human behavior.
That was when everything changed.
I just can't figure out why.
I keep going over that night, hour by hour.
Well, stop... going over that night, because everything is fine.
The girls are just as crazy about you as I am.
I don't know.
I'm not feeling it.
Well...
Are you feeling this?
Bree, I know what's going on.
You're trying to distract me with sex, and if that's the case...
Mmm.
Bring it on.
Wake up!
I made you waffles.
Come back when you learn how to make mimosas.
Come on!
I left Celia alone with them.
There won't be any left.
Damn it, Juanita!
That's enough!
Get outta here now!
Carlos!
Juanita, honey, I'm sorry!
Why have you been so short-tempered lately?
Gosh, I don't know.
Maybe I'm upset about my golf swing or the economy... or maybe it's because I killed a guy.
Look, I get it, okay?
But we have to move on with our lives.
Don't you think I want to?
I just can't stop thinking about this.
No matter what I do, it's this horrible thing that is always there.
I need to talk to someone.
I know a guy named Tom Collins.
He's a great listener.
I meant father Dugan.
Okay, are you crazy?
You can't tell anyone.
That's too risky.
A priest can't share what you say in confession.
Are you sure he's not just gonna make you feel guiltier?
I mean, that's their thing.
Fine.
We'll go see the priest.
I have to.
I'm turning into a terrible husband, father.
I need to get this off my conscience.
It's tearing me apart.
Susan.
What are you doing?
Oh.
I was looking out the window, and I noticed dust in the corner of each windowpane.
It's been driving me nuts.
Okay.
What's going on with you?
What do you mean?
Well, there's a lot of weird stuff you like to do in the bedroom, but cleaning... not so much.
Couldn't sleep.
Yeah, that's been happening a lot lately.
You don't sleep.
You don't eat.
You never leave the house.
That's not true.
I'm substitute teaching today.
And that's great, but...
Did you have a fight with the girls?
What?
Why would you say that?
Well, a month ago, you were so excited to move back to the lane, and now you never see 'em.
There's... no coffee, no poker, no... bitching about husbands over coffee and poker.
The girls and I are fine.
Then what is it?
Come on, Susan.
It's me.
You can tell me anything.
I'm going for a run.
Susan.
Well, you said I should get out of the house more.
Hey.
So what do we know about the new guy?
Definitely rich.
Check out the car.
Definitely single.
Check out the fish.
Rich and single...
I wonder what he looks like.
You rarely get the trifecta.
What's your guess?
Wonky eye?
Rabbit teeth?
Comb-over?
One normal eyebrow, one really big one?
Baby hands?
I had it all on one guy.
Did not end well.
Well, I actually saw our new neighbor this morning.
Hmm. 6'1". 190.
He was wearing this great-looking pair of jeans.
And let me just say,
I can tell you one thing that isn't wonky.
Gaby.
Oh, come on.
I'm married.
I'm not dead.
Can still imagine all the dirty things I'd do to him.
- Like what?
- Oh, god!
Oh!
I didn't know you were...
I'm Susan Delfino.
Ah.
Nice to meet you.
Ben Faulkner.
Hi.
Well, I'm actually 6'2", and I haven't been 190 since I played rugby, but, uh, thank you.
Uh, and as for the jeans, you know, I could never figure out why they would cost 200 bucks.
Now I know.
Ladies, excuse me.
- Oh.
Okay.
- Thanks.
Welcome.
Dibs.
Look who's out.
Hey, Susan!
Uh, would you like to join us for coffee?
!
Uh, sorry.
I can't talk.
I'm subbing today!
Can't be late!
Is anyone talking to her?
I tried.
She's not returning my calls.
Same here.
She's obviously avoiding us.
I'm telling you, that is one loose cannon.
Well, we have got to get her back in the fold.
This is too risky.
Says the woman who's dating a cop.
Did it ever occur to you that it might be good to keep him close?
If there's ever an investigation,
I will be the first to know.
I'm doing this for us.
He's that good in the sack?
You have no idea.
And when you finish your worksheets on ladybugs, we will go outside and see if we can find some.
Susan, how's it going?
Good.
It's nice to be back.
To be honest,
I've been feeling a little down lately.
This is just what I needed.
Mrs. Delfino?
Cupcake's not moving.
She's probably sleeping, honey.
No, I poked her with my pencil a couple times.
She is d-e-a dead.
Uh... it's okay, kids.
I know what to do.
Oh, my god.
What do I do?
There's a little spot in the garden where we bury the class pets.
- Bury?
- Yeah.
Have a little funeral.
Say a few words.
Just don't mention god.
Amanda's parents are atheists, lawyers, and major douches.
Bless me, father, for I have sinned.
It's been a while since my last confession.
Continue, my son.
"My son." I'm sorry.
It's just you're, like, a thousand years older than me.
Who are you and where's father Dugan?
Leaving on sabbatical.
Fun for him and fun for me.
This is my first week of confessions.
It is?
Yeah, and, man, the things I've heard.
There was a lady yesterday who...
No, no, no, I can't say it.
I think I'll come back.
Unh-unh.
No.
You're not going anywhere.
I told you to wait in the car.
Don't snap at me.
That's why we're here.
You keep saying you wanna talk to someone, so talk to this guy.
He seems perfectly... enthusiastic.
He's 12 years old.
This will blow his collar off.
Oh, man, this must be awesome.
I'm so bummed I can't tweet anymore.
Sorry.
If it's not father Dugan, I'm not doing this.
No...
let's go.
Nuts.
I was really hoping this would be a good one.
I made out with two chicks once in college.
This job rocks!
Uh...
I don't know if you've ever buried anything before, but you have to dig a hole.
Right.
Of course.
I knew that.
It's funny the way life works out sometimes, isn't it?
I mean, I wasn't even supposed to be here today.
Once again, in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Now I have to carry this around with me for the rest of my life.
Don't be sad, Mrs. Delfino.
Cupcake was kind of a bad hamster.
She had three babies and ate them.
But does that mean she deserved to die?
We don't get to make that call, Juanita.
We're not god.
That's right, Amanda.
I said it.
What have I done?
It's not your fault.
I know it's not my fault, but try telling that to Cupcake's family when they show up looking for her.
There.
We're done.
Now let's all slap on a happy face and pretend like this never happened.
Can I come in?
I'm really not feeling like drinking right now.
Great.
Mmm.
So... were you two close?
Pardon?
You and Cupcake.
Juanita told me what happened.
I assume you two had a long history, went to college together, backpacked through Europe.
It just sort of hit me in a weird way.
I'm worried about you.
First, you stop talking to your friends.
Now you're wigging out at a rat funeral.
You're making me nervous.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not handling accessory to murder as well as the rest of you.
Susan, I'm begging you.
This is my husband's life we're talking about.
If anything were to happen to him, think of what would happen to me and my girls.
I know you're having a hard time, but please hold it together.
I'm trying.
Try harder.
Bree?
Do I smell...
Yes, white chocolate macadamia nut...
your favorite.
Oh!
Now you're my favorite.
Mwah.
Hmm.
How was your day?
Terrific.
I found a dead body.
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.
You don't wanna hear about this.
No, I do.
Your work is fascinating.
So, um, where exactly did you find this body?
Warehouse out by the docks.
So now I'm a big hero because I cracked a case those poor bastards in New haven P.D.
have been working on for months.
Oh, good for you.
Mm.
I got lucky.
All I did was spot a sedan with Connecticut plates, and I asked myself, "Who owns that car?"
The dead man had a car.
Exactly.
The killers did everything right, but they forgot to get rid of the victim's ride.
What idiots.
Mm-hmm.
So you kept his keys, but it never occurred to you he might have a car.
I just threw all his stuff in our safe.
I didn't spend a lot of time thinking about it.
There it is.
Drop it off in a bad part of town, and let social decay... take its course.
Oh, god, do you have to tidy up?
Get in.
If anybody catches us in this car, we're dead.
Oh, no, it's a stick.
I can't drive a stick.
Can you?
I did once in high school.
It's easy.
Just one extra pedal.
Oh.
It was easier when I was drunk.
What should I do?
Should I gun it?
Gun it?
You can't even drive it.
I thought that was you.
- Chuck.
Look, Gaby, it's Chuck.
- Mm.
I-I saw you were struggling.
Whose car is this?
- My aunt's.
- My friend's.
Her aunt and my friend.
Aunt Shirley.
She, uh, came over to my place last night for book club, and...
She had too much to drink.
Classic Shirley.
So we told her we'd bring her car back today.
- In fact, she's waiting for us, so we should scoot.
- Yeah.
No way.
- I'll drive.
- What?
The way you guys are going, you're gonna kill someone.
Go, Bob.
I'll meet you back at the station.
Oh, no, Bob, Bob, don't go!
Bob?
Oh.
Well...
Okay, a road trip in this neat old car with your cop boyfriend.
Fun.
So where does Shirley live?
Yeah, Bree, where does she live?
Why are you asking me?
She's your aunt.
Just keep driving.
I'll tell you when to turn.
Huh.
That's interesting.
No, it's not.
I mean... what is?
Oklahoma city redhawks.
Is your aunt a fan?
Oh, yeah, Shirley loves that... uh... sport.
And... men's cologne?
She's a lesbian.
Yeah.
She could've been married, but, no, she's a lesbian.
So, this, um, aunt or... friend, who's a men's cologne-wearing lesbian... she also likes to chew tobacco?
'Cause I never met a woman who likes to chew... ever.
I chew tobacco.
And I'm a woman.
Yeah.
Mmm.
All that's missing is a glass of chardonnay.
I keep telling her to quit.
"Do you want mouth cancer?" I say, but she won't listen.
You okay?
Yeah.
Ugh!
No.
Pull over.
Now.
Sorry!
Shirley likes plain.
I prefer chocolate.
Oh!
Get out.
What?
I'm taking your car.
Oh, my god.
I could kiss you!
What?
What are you...
Just get out!
Shh!
Keep your voice down.
That man over there is a cop.
A cop?
No!
Get back in here.
When you start something, young man, you see it through.
Buckle up!
Hey, what happened?
Shirley.
Just happened to be walking by.
Isn't that a stroke of luck?
So do you think your friend Bob could give us a ride home?
Sure.
I'll...
I'll call him.
So how's that dating a cop while covering up a murder working out for you?
Hey, Renee.
Ladies.
Don't distract them.
They have an important job to do.
I'm gonna go see the new neighbor.
You know, give him a ride on the ol' welcome wagon.
Wow, that was fast.
- I didn't know you two had even talked.
- We haven't.
So what makes you think he's gonna be interested?
Hear that, ladies?
Watch and learn.
I will show you some of my secrets.
Hi.
I'm gonna save us some time.
Look, I'm single.
You're single.
I'm hot.
You're hot.
Assuming you're not gay, and those shoes tell me you're not, we could do that thing where we flirt for a few weeks.
You can stare at my ass getting the mail, and I do get my mail four times a day.
Or you... could invite me in for... coffee...
Right now.
Thanks for the offer, but, uh, I'm good.
Um, when I said "coffee,"
you did know I meant sex, right?
Oh, you were subtle, but, uh, yeah.
I got it.
Wow.
You should write a book.
Otherwise, when you die, your secrets will die with you.
Father Dugan!
I'm so glad I caught you.
I don't know if you remember me.
Gabrielle Solis.
I assume you've come to apologize for taking a phone call during my easter sermon?
Oh!
I'm sorry, father.
But, you know, if you don't confirm those spa appointments, you lose 'em.
Yeah.
Um, anyway, I came here about Carlos.
He's in trouble, and he needs your help.
Well, I'd love to help Carlos.
He's a good man.
But I'm afraid you're too late.
What?
You were the one who kept blabbing in that sermon how it's never too late to confess your sins.
See?
I can listen and take calls.
It's true.
God waits until the heart is ready.
But the airlines are a little stricter, and I'm not going overseas in a middle seat.
So if you'll excuse me.
You getting on, too, miss?
Uh, yes, but I couldn't... manage my bag.
Be a dear and grab it for me?
Hey.
What are you doing?
Taking you to the airport... with one quick detour.
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Are you crazy?
I can't miss my plane.
Well, I'm sorry if I'm trying to get you to do god's work instead of going on your dream vacation to...
Rwanda, where I'll be digging wells... for lepers.
Well, your little friends are gonna have to wait.
- Excuse me.
- Whoa.
Well, where did you u me from?
We're headed off on our honeymoon.
And we can't have any detours.
They say you have to get to the airport three hours early for international flights.
Oh, honey, relax.
Since we caught Bin Laden, you can stroll on the plane anytime you want.
It's just, I've done something, father,
And I'm afraid that it's... unforgivable.
God can forgive us for anything.
Really?
Anything?
Yes.
If we're willing to show that we are truly repentant.
How?
Well, it's not by what we say.
It's by what we do.
For instance, if we were talking about a crime... then confessing to the authorities would prove the intentions of our heart.
That... is not an option.
There are other people involved...
innocent people.
You can't ask to be absolved for a sin that you intend to keep hidden.
You should go.
You're gonna miss your flight.
I don't wanna leave you, Carlos, not till I'm sure that you're gonna be okay.
Father Dugan, I don't see any way that I am ever going to be okay.
Hey.
Hey.
I wish I could make you stop thinking about this.
Yeah, me, too.
I don't even know what I was looking for.
There is no absolution for this thing.
I just have to live with it.
Every noise I'd hear at night, it was him.
Every dark alley I passed, he was waiting for me.
When I'd lie in bed,
I was afraid he'd come find me.
He was in my dreams... and in my nightmares.
I couldn't escape him.
And that's what I had to live with... until now.
For the first time, I'm not scared.
You did that for me.
Yeah... by taking a man's life.
Yes, you may have taken a life, but you also saved one.
So if it's absolution you're looking for...
I give it to you.
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, is everything okay with the kids?
Yeah, yeah, the...
the kids are fine.
I just...
What?
Did something happen?
I really... need you right now.
Okay.
Morning.
Morning.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Crap, crap, crap.
- Come on.
Come on.
- Okay.
- Watch out for the, uh...
- Okay, okay, o...
- Honey.
Ooh.
- No, I'm okay.
Okay, go.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
They're still asleep.
Thank god.
I'll start the coffee.
Okay, you read my mind.
- Hey.
- Yeah?
So last night...
Yeah.
We should talk about it.
Uh-huh.
I mean...
If you wanna get back together...
I'm open to that.
But we have some serious problems that are gonna require serious work.
Oh, god.
Last night... uh... was... not about getting back together.
Then what the hell was it about?
I...
I had a nightmare.
Well... a-a nightmare?
Are you kidding me?
You've gotta understand.
I'm having a lot of nightmares.
This is such a scary time, and I really need you.
That's-that's why I didn't want to tell the kids.
Having you across the street makes me feel safe.
You're unbelievable.
You know what you do when you're scared, Lynette?
You buy a night-light.
You don't go have sex with the guy you are supposed to be separated from!
I want french toast.
- I hate french toast.
I want pancakes.
- Oh.
Kids... there's something your mom and I need to tell you.
Yeah.
Why don't we sit down?
Hey, I, uh, I know it's a barbecue, but isn't that a little casual?
Yeah, um,
I don't think I'm gonna go this year.
Why don't you go without me?
Hey, do I need to be worried?
I told you.
I'm fine.
I don't mean worried about you.
I mean worried about us.
I thought this was some problem between you and your friends, but... the way you've been shutting me out,
I'm starting to think you've got a problem with me.
How could you say that?
No matter what I'm going through,
I would never let anything come between us.
Yeah, I'm sure Tom and Lynette felt the same way.
Look where they ended up.
Well, I'm headed over there without you.
No.
I'm going with you.
You're right.
I do have a problem with the girls.
It's about time I went over there and straightened it out.
No!
No way.
You are not bringing Mike in on this.
He's not gonna tell anyone.
We can trust him.
Oh, just like I could trust you when we agreed to keep this between us?
Susan, we all empathize with your position, but I don't think it's smart to tell Mike.
Well, he knows something is up.
It's affecting our marriage.
You know what's gonna affect my marriage?
when my husband goes to prison.
I think we should let her tell him.
I can't believe this.
We all made a pact that night.
I don't remember anybody bringing up
These extra conditions.
Well, you weren't exactly asking anyone's opinion that night, were you, Bree?
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you elected yourself chairman of the... dead guy committee and started making decisions for everyone.
Like you always do.
Well, somebody had to, Susan,
And it sure as hell wasn't gonna be you.
I'm done talking about this.
The only reason I came to this barbecue was to let you know that I am telling Mike.
The hell you are.
Aah!
Oh, my god!
Gaby!
Gaby!
- Trade Manning?
- What, are you out of your mind?
Think for a minute.
When is his stock ever gonna be higher?
Let me go!
You could get a great player.
Yeah, maybe a great quarterback, like, I don't know.
Manning?
- Ow!
- Get off me!
Girls, people can hear us!
Ow!
I told you we couldn't trust her!
I can't see.
Lynette!
Aah!
Oh!
I got it!
What the hell's going on?
Uh, well...
I...
lost my earring, and the girls here were kind enough to help me look for it.
Oh!
There it is!
I went food shopping yesterday.
I kept having to put things back.
I'd take a couple of cans of peaches.
And then I'd remember that Tom was the only one who liked them, put them back.
Sweet pickles...
Tom.
Put them back.
I am so sorry.
With everything that's been going on,
I haven't been there for you.
I guess we've all been guilty of that.
I'm sorry, Susan.
This is so damn hard.
You know, the good thing about Mike and Tom not knowing is they can't be implicated.
If something were to happen, at least they'd be okay.
We are never gonna be able to tell anybody about this, are we?
No.
Are you gonna be able to live with that?
I'm gonna try.
It's only the best of friends who stay long after the party's over to help clean up...
To cleanse the pain of a guilty conscience... to pick up the pieces... of a broken marriage...
To sweep away the loneliness of keeping a secret.
Yes...
It's good to have friends who help clean up our messes.
But every housewife knows that as soon as one mess is taken care of... another one appears.
And we may find ourselves... right back where we started.
Previously on...
I wanna get things right this time.
Bree's relationship with detective Vance got serious.
What are we gonna say to people?
Tom and Lynette decided to separate.
We shouldn't tell anyone until we tell the kids.
Oh, god.
The kids.
Sit down.
Ow!
Gaby's stepfather returned to terrorize her again...
I remember those nights in your room, baby.
No!
Stop.
Until Carlos stopped him... permanently.
Gaby?
What happened?
- I killed him.
- And now he's gonna go to jail because he was trying to protect me.
Calm down.
We just need time to think.
We don't have time.
Yes, there was the dinner party.
Everybody's coming.
Including your boyfriend the detective.
I killed the son of a bitch who hurt my wife.
If I have to go to prison, I will.
That's not gonna happen.
Every hostess knows there's work to be done after the guests leave a party.
And only the best of friends will stay long after the party's over... to help clean up the mess.
They help with the heavy lifting... they work together to lighten the load.
They take on the most unpleasant tasks.
And, of course, there's no task more unpleasant than getting rid of an unwanted guest.
I should go move the car off the trail.
You gonna be okay?
Is this happening?
Are we really doing this?
Everyone stay focused.
The hardest part is over.
Now all we have to do is fill this in.
Oh, my god.
I thought I got everything.
No.
No, you missed the phone.
And if you missed that, what else did you miss?
Susan, it's gonna be okay.
How is it going to be okay?
Someone is calling the dead guy.
- "Home."
- See?
He has a home... with people who care about him, people who are going to come looking for him, leading them straight to us.
What do you want us to do?
It's not too late.
We... we could still go to the police.
And send my husband back to prison?
This time for murder?
No, not necessarily.
It was self-defense.
He broke into your house.
He threatened you.
We could explain that.
Yeah, then we can explain how we dumped him in a trunk, ate some cheesecake, and buried him in the woods!
We are going to get caught.
People always get caught.
We can't do this.
We're not criminals.
We drive carpool.
That's enough.
This is a very bad man.
He attacked our friend, and her husband protected her, and now we are gonna protect them.
That means we tell no one.
Not the police... not our families.
No one.
When we bury the body, we bury the secret forever.
Susan?
Yes, it's only the best of friends who stay long after the party's over to help clean up the mess...
Even when that mess may be bigger than they bargained for.
It has been said that change doesn't happen overnight, but over the course of month, it's amazing how much the ground can shift beneath us.
A woman who helped conceal a crime is now sleeping with a detective.
A man who used to look forward to bedtime... is now finding himself dreading it.
A woman who once told her husband everything is now keeping a terrible secret.
And a couple who have decided to separate is now going to great lengths to show that nothing has changed.
Crap!
Crap!
Crap!
Crap!
Aah!
Son of a...
Hey, hey, hey, guys!
Got up early, so I figured, what the heck?
I'll go get your mom some coffee...
the good stuff.
She deserves it.
She needs it, too.
I didn't sleep last night.
But you would know that.
You were there.
Do not drink this.
It's been in my car for three days.
Where are your shoes, dad?
It's casual friday.
Casual thursday.
Come on.
We're gonna miss the bus.
See ya later.
I'll see ya at dinner.
Love you.
God, I practically lost a toe out there.
It wouldn't have happened if you hadn't overslept.
Yeah, well, you know, you took the good alarm clock along with the good pillow and the house.
This is ridiculous.
We have to tell the kids we've separated.
We will, but this weekend is Gaby's big barbecue, and I don't wanna ruin it for them.
Yeah, and last weekend, you didn't wanna ruin the basketball tournament.
The weekend before that, Penny's birthday.
Come on, Lynette.
Are you sure this is about the kids?
What else would it be?
No, Tom, nothing's changed.
We still need time away from each other.
Yeah, I agree.
We got a lot of problems to work out, so why can't we tell the kids?
I just think they deserve one more happy weekend before we tear this family apart.
You know what?
You're...
Paige is up.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Don't take this the wrong way, but you could do this professionally.
Coming from a man who's on a first-name basis with half the hookers in Fairview, that's quite a compliment, detective.
Hey, I was thinking maybe this weekend, we could head up to that place in the mountains, just the two of us.
Oh, that sounds lovely, but Gaby is having her annual barbecue on saturday.
Am I invited?
Of course you are.
Why wouldn't you be?
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe because your friends don't like me.
What?
You are imagining things.
It's true.
They don't talk to me.
They don't make eye contact.
It's been that way for weeks, ever since the night of the dinner party.
Why...
Uh, why would you say that?
Bree, I'm a cop.
I got an eye for human behavior.
That was when everything changed.
I just can't figure out why.
I keep going over that night, hour by hour.
Well, stop... going over that night, because everything is fine.
The girls are just as crazy about you as I am.
I don't know.
I'm not feeling it.
Well...
Are you feeling this?
Bree, I know what's going on.
You're trying to distract me with sex, and if that's the case...
Mmm.
Bring it on.
Wake up!
I made you waffles.
Come back when you learn how to make mimosas.
Come on!
I left Celia alone with them.
There won't be any left.
Damn it, Juanita!
That's enough!
Get outta here now!
Carlos!
Juanita, honey, I'm sorry!
Why have you been so short-tempered lately?
Gosh, I don't know.
Maybe I'm upset about my golf swing or the economy... or maybe it's because I killed a guy.
Look, I get it, okay?
But we have to move on with our lives.
Don't you think I want to?
I just can't stop thinking about this.
No matter what I do, it's this horrible thing that is always there.
I need to talk to someone.
I know a guy named Tom Collins.
He's a great listener.
I meant father Dugan.
Okay, are you crazy?
You can't tell anyone.
That's too risky.
A priest can't share what you say in confession.
Are you sure he's not just gonna make you feel guiltier?
I mean, that's their thing.
Fine.
We'll go see the priest.
I have to.
I'm turning into a terrible husband, father.
I need to get this off my conscience.
It's tearing me apart.
Susan.
What are you doing?
Oh.
I was looking out the window, and I noticed dust in the corner of each windowpane.
It's been driving me nuts.
Okay.
What's going on with you?
What do you mean?
Well, there's a lot of weird stuff you like to do in the bedroom, but cleaning... not so much.
Couldn't sleep.
Yeah, that's been happening a lot lately.
You don't sleep.
You don't eat.
You never leave the house.
That's not true.
I'm substitute teaching today.
And that's great, but...
Did you have a fight with the girls?
What?
Why would you say that?
Well, a month ago, you were so excited to move back to the lane, and now you never see 'em.
There's... no coffee, no poker, no... bitching about husbands over coffee and poker.
The girls and I are fine.
Then what is it?
Come on, Susan.
It's me.
You can tell me anything.
I'm going for a run.
Susan.
Well, you said I should get out of the house more.
Hey.
So what do we know about the new guy?
Definitely rich.
Check out the car.
Definitely single.
Check out the fish.
Rich and single...
I wonder what he looks like.
You rarely get the trifecta.
What's your guess?
Wonky eye?
Rabbit teeth?
Comb-over?
One normal eyebrow, one really big one?
Baby hands?
I had it all on one guy.
Did not end well.
Well, I actually saw our new neighbor this morning.
Hmm. 6'1". 190.
He was wearing this great-looking pair of jeans.
And let me just say,
I can tell you one thing that isn't wonky.
Gaby.
Oh, come on.
I'm married.
I'm not dead.
Can still imagine all the dirty things I'd do to him.
- Like what?
- Oh, god!
Oh!
I didn't know you were...
I'm Susan Delfino.
Ah.
Nice to meet you.
Ben Faulkner.
Hi.
Well, I'm actually 6'2", and I haven't been 190 since I played rugby, but, uh, thank you.
Uh, and as for the jeans, you know, I could never figure out why they would cost 200 bucks.
Now I know.
Ladies, excuse me.
- Oh.
Okay.
- Thanks.
Welcome.
Dibs.
Look who's out.
Hey, Susan!
Uh, would you like to join us for coffee?
!
Uh, sorry.
I can't talk.
I'm subbing today!
Can't be late!
Is anyone talking to her?
I tried.
She's not returning my calls.
Same here.
She's obviously avoiding us.
I'm telling you, that is one loose cannon.
Well, we have got to get her back in the fold.
This is too risky.
Says the woman who's dating a cop.
Did it ever occur to you that it might be good to keep him close?
If there's ever an investigation,
I will be the first to know.
I'm doing this for us.
He's that good in the sack?
You have no idea.
And when you finish your worksheets on ladybugs, we will go outside and see if we can find some.
Susan, how's it going?
Good.
It's nice to be back.
To be honest,
I've been feeling a little down lately.
This is just what I needed.
Mrs. Delfino?
Cupcake's not moving.
She's probably sleeping, honey.
No, I poked her with my pencil a couple times.
She is d-e-a dead.
Uh... it's okay, kids.
I know what to do.
Oh, my god.
What do I do?
There's a little spot in the garden where we bury the class pets.
- Bury?
- Yeah.
Have a little funeral.
Say a few words.
Just don't mention god.
Amanda's parents are atheists, lawyers, and major douches.
Bless me, father, for I have sinned.
It's been a while since my last confession.
Continue, my son.
"My son." I'm sorry.
It's just you're, like, a thousand years older than me.
Who are you and where's father Dugan?
Leaving on sabbatical.
Fun for him and fun for me.
This is my first week of confessions.
It is?
Yeah, and, man, the things I've heard.
There was a lady yesterday who...
No, no, no, I can't say it.
I think I'll come back.
Unh-unh.
No.
You're not going anywhere.
I told you to wait in the car.
Don't snap at me.
That's why we're here.
You keep saying you wanna talk to someone, so talk to this guy.
He seems perfectly... enthusiastic.
He's 12 years old.
This will blow his collar off.
Oh, man, this must be awesome.
I'm so bummed I can't tweet anymore.
Sorry.
If it's not father Dugan, I'm not doing this.
No...
let's go.
Nuts.
I was really hoping this would be a good one.
I made out with two chicks once in college.
This job rocks!
Uh...
I don't know if you've ever buried anything before, but you have to dig a hole.
Right.
Of course.
I knew that.
It's funny the way life works out sometimes, isn't it?
I mean, I wasn't even supposed to be here today.
Once again, in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Now I have to carry this around with me for the rest of my life.
Don't be sad, Mrs. Delfino.
Cupcake was kind of a bad hamster.
She had three babies and ate them.
But does that mean she deserved to die?
We don't get to make that call, Juanita.
We're not god.
That's right, Amanda.
I said it.
What have I done?
It's not your fault.
I know it's not my fault, but try telling that to Cupcake's family when they show up looking for her.
There.
We're done.
Now let's all slap on a happy face and pretend like this never happened.
Can I come in?
I'm really not feeling like drinking right now.
Great.
Mmm.
So... were you two close?
Pardon?
You and Cupcake.
Juanita told me what happened.
I assume you two had a long history, went to college together, backpacked through Europe.
It just sort of hit me in a weird way.
I'm worried about you.
First, you stop talking to your friends.
Now you're wigging out at a rat funeral.
You're making me nervous.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not handling accessory to murder as well as the rest of you.
Susan, I'm begging you.
This is my husband's life we're talking about.
If anything were to happen to him, think of what would happen to me and my girls.
I know you're having a hard time, but please hold it together.
I'm trying.
Try harder.
Bree?
Do I smell...
Yes, white chocolate macadamia nut...
your favorite.
Oh!
Now you're my favorite.
Mwah.
Hmm.
How was your day?
Terrific.
I found a dead body.
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.
You don't wanna hear about this.
No, I do.
Your work is fascinating.
So, um, where exactly did you find this body?
Warehouse out by the docks.
So now I'm a big hero because I cracked a case those poor bastards in New haven P.D.
have been working on for months.
Oh, good for you.
Mm.
I got lucky.
All I did was spot a sedan with Connecticut plates, and I asked myself, "Who owns that car?"
The dead man had a car.
Exactly.
The killers did everything right, but they forgot to get rid of the victim's ride.
What idiots.
Mm-hmm.
So you kept his keys, but it never occurred to you he might have a car.
I just threw all his stuff in our safe.
I didn't spend a lot of time thinking about it.
There it is.
Drop it off in a bad part of town, and let social decay... take its course.
Oh, god, do you have to tidy up?
Get in.
If anybody catches us in this car, we're dead.
Oh, no, it's a stick.
I can't drive a stick.
Can you?
I did once in high school.
It's easy.
Just one extra pedal.
Oh.
It was easier when I was drunk.
What should I do?
Should I gun it?
Gun it?
You can't even drive it.
I thought that was you.
- Chuck.
Look, Gaby, it's Chuck.
- Mm.
I-I saw you were struggling.
Whose car is this?
- My aunt's.
- My friend's.
Her aunt and my friend.
Aunt Shirley.
She, uh, came over to my place last night for book club, and...
She had too much to drink.
Classic Shirley.
So we told her we'd bring her car back today.
- In fact, she's waiting for us, so we should scoot.
- Yeah.
No way.
- I'll drive.
- What?
The way you guys are going, you're gonna kill someone.
Go, Bob.
I'll meet you back at the station.
Oh, no, Bob, Bob, don't go!
Bob?
Oh.
Well...
Okay, a road trip in this neat old car with your cop boyfriend.
Fun.
So where does Shirley live?
Yeah, Bree, where does she live?
Why are you asking me?
She's your aunt.
Just keep driving.
I'll tell you when to turn.
Huh.
That's interesting.
No, it's not.
I mean... what is?
Oklahoma city redhawks.
Is your aunt a fan?
Oh, yeah, Shirley loves that... uh... sport.
And... men's cologne?
She's a lesbian.
Yeah.
She could've been married, but, no, she's a lesbian.
So, this, um, aunt or... friend, who's a men's cologne-wearing lesbian... she also likes to chew tobacco?
'Cause I never met a woman who likes to chew... ever.
I chew tobacco.
And I'm a woman.
Yeah.
Mmm.
All that's missing is a glass of chardonnay.
I keep telling her to quit.
"Do you want mouth cancer?" I say, but she won't listen.
You okay?
Yeah.
Ugh!
No.
Pull over.
Now.
Sorry!
Shirley likes plain.
I prefer chocolate.
Oh!
Get out.
What?
I'm taking your car.
Oh, my god.
I could kiss you!
What?
What are you...
Just get out!
Shh!
Keep your voice down.
That man over there is a cop.
A cop?
No!
Get back in here.
When you start something, young man, you see it through.
Buckle up!
Hey, what happened?
Shirley.
Just happened to be walking by.
Isn't that a stroke of luck?
So do you think your friend Bob could give us a ride home?
Sure.
I'll...
I'll call him.
So how's that dating a cop while covering up a murder working out for you?
Hey, Renee.
Ladies.
Don't distract them.
They have an important job to do.
I'm gonna go see the new neighbor.
You know, give him a ride on the ol' welcome wagon.
Wow, that was fast.
- I didn't know you two had even talked.
- We haven't.
So what makes you think he's gonna be interested?
Hear that, ladies?
Watch and learn.
I will show you some of my secrets.
Hi.
I'm gonna save us some time.
Look, I'm single.
You're single.
I'm hot.
You're hot.
Assuming you're not gay, and those shoes tell me you're not, we could do that thing where we flirt for a few weeks.
You can stare at my ass getting the mail, and I do get my mail four times a day.
Or you... could invite me in for... coffee...
Right now.
Thanks for the offer, but, uh, I'm good.
Um, when I said "coffee,"
you did know I meant sex, right?
Oh, you were subtle, but, uh, yeah.
I got it.
Wow.
You should write a book.
Otherwise, when you die, your secrets will die with you.
Father Dugan!
I'm so glad I caught you.
I don't know if you remember me.
Gabrielle Solis.
I assume you've come to apologize for taking a phone call during my easter sermon?
Oh!
I'm sorry, father.
But, you know, if you don't confirm those spa appointments, you lose 'em.
Yeah.
Um, anyway, I came here about Carlos.
He's in trouble, and he needs your help.
Well, I'd love to help Carlos.
He's a good man.
But I'm afraid you're too late.
What?
You were the one who kept blabbing in that sermon how it's never too late to confess your sins.
See?
I can listen and take calls.
It's true.
God waits until the heart is ready.
But the airlines are a little stricter, and I'm not going overseas in a middle seat.
So if you'll excuse me.
You getting on, too, miss?
Uh, yes, but I couldn't... manage my bag.
Be a dear and grab it for me?
Hey.
What are you doing?
Taking you to the airport... with one quick detour.
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Are you crazy?
I can't miss my plane.
Well, I'm sorry if I'm trying to get you to do god's work instead of going on your dream vacation to...
Rwanda, where I'll be digging wells... for lepers.
Well, your little friends are gonna have to wait.
- Excuse me.
- Whoa.
Well, where did you u me from?
We're headed off on our honeymoon.
And we can't have any detours.
They say you have to get to the airport three hours early for international flights.
Oh, honey, relax.
Since we caught Bin Laden, you can stroll on the plane anytime you want.
It's just, I've done something, father,
And I'm afraid that it's... unforgivable.
God can forgive us for anything.
Really?
Anything?
Yes.
If we're willing to show that we are truly repentant.
How?
Well, it's not by what we say.
It's by what we do.
For instance, if we were talking about a crime... then confessing to the authorities would prove the intentions of our heart.
That... is not an option.
There are other people involved...
innocent people.
You can't ask to be absolved for a sin that you intend to keep hidden.
You should go.
You're gonna miss your flight.
I don't wanna leave you, Carlos, not till I'm sure that you're gonna be okay.
Father Dugan, I don't see any way that I am ever going to be okay.
Hey.
Hey.
I wish I could make you stop thinking about this.
Yeah, me, too.
I don't even know what I was looking for.
There is no absolution for this thing.
I just have to live with it.
Every noise I'd hear at night, it was him.
Every dark alley I passed, he was waiting for me.
When I'd lie in bed,
I was afraid he'd come find me.
He was in my dreams... and in my nightmares.
I couldn't escape him.
And that's what I had to live with... until now.
For the first time, I'm not scared.
You did that for me.
Yeah... by taking a man's life.
Yes, you may have taken a life, but you also saved one.
So if it's absolution you're looking for...
I give it to you.
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, is everything okay with the kids?
Yeah, yeah, the...
the kids are fine.
I just...
What?
Did something happen?
I really... need you right now.
Okay.
Morning.
Morning.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Crap, crap, crap.
- Come on.
Come on.
- Okay.
- Watch out for the, uh...
- Okay, okay, o...
- Honey.
Ooh.
- No, I'm okay.
Okay, go.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
They're still asleep.
Thank god.
I'll start the coffee.
Okay, you read my mind.
- Hey.
- Yeah?
So last night...
Yeah.
We should talk about it.
Uh-huh.
I mean...
If you wanna get back together...
I'm open to that.
But we have some serious problems that are gonna require serious work.
Oh, god.
Last night... uh... was... not about getting back together.
Then what the hell was it about?
I...
I had a nightmare.
Well... a-a nightmare?
Are you kidding me?
You've gotta understand.
I'm having a lot of nightmares.
This is such a scary time, and I really need you.
That's-that's why I didn't want to tell the kids.
Having you across the street makes me feel safe.
You're unbelievable.
You know what you do when you're scared, Lynette?
You buy a night-light.
You don't go have sex with the guy you are supposed to be separated from!
I want french toast.
- I hate french toast.
I want pancakes.
- Oh.
Kids... there's something your mom and I need to tell you.
Yeah.
Why don't we sit down?
Hey, I, uh, I know it's a barbecue, but isn't that a little casual?
Yeah, um,
I don't think I'm gonna go this year.
Why don't you go without me?
Hey, do I need to be worried?
I told you.
I'm fine.
I don't mean worried about you.
I mean worried about us.
I thought this was some problem between you and your friends, but... the way you've been shutting me out,
I'm starting to think you've got a problem with me.
How could you say that?
No matter what I'm going through,
I would never let anything come between us.
Yeah, I'm sure Tom and Lynette felt the same way.
Look where they ended up.
Well, I'm headed over there without you.
No.
I'm going with you.
You're right.
I do have a problem with the girls.
It's about time I went over there and straightened it out.
No!
No way.
You are not bringing Mike in on this.
He's not gonna tell anyone.
We can trust him.
Oh, just like I could trust you when we agreed to keep this between us?
Susan, we all empathize with your position, but I don't think it's smart to tell Mike.
Well, he knows something is up.
It's affecting our marriage.
You know what's gonna affect my marriage?
when my husband goes to prison.
I think we should let her tell him.
I can't believe this.
We all made a pact that night.
I don't remember anybody bringing up
These extra conditions.
Well, you weren't exactly asking anyone's opinion that night, were you, Bree?
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you elected yourself chairman of the... dead guy committee and started making decisions for everyone.
Like you always do.
Well, somebody had to, Susan,
And it sure as hell wasn't gonna be you.
I'm done talking about this.
The only reason I came to this barbecue was to let you know that I am telling Mike.
The hell you are.
Aah!
Oh, my god!
Gaby!
Gaby!
- Trade Manning?
- What, are you out of your mind?
Think for a minute.
When is his stock ever gonna be higher?
Let me go!
You could get a great player.
Yeah, maybe a great quarterback, like, I don't know.
Manning?
- Ow!
- Get off me!
Girls, people can hear us!
Ow!
I told you we couldn't trust her!
I can't see.
Lynette!
Aah!
Oh!
I got it!
What the hell's going on?
Uh, well...
I...
lost my earring, and the girls here were kind enough to help me look for it.
Oh!
There it is!
I went food shopping yesterday.
I kept having to put things back.
I'd take a couple of cans of peaches.
And then I'd remember that Tom was the only one who liked them, put them back.
Sweet pickles...
Tom.
Put them back.
I am so sorry.
With everything that's been going on,
I haven't been there for you.
I guess we've all been guilty of that.
I'm sorry, Susan.
This is so damn hard.
You know, the good thing about Mike and Tom not knowing is they can't be implicated.
If something were to happen, at least they'd be okay.
We are never gonna be able to tell anybody about this, are we?
No.
Are you gonna be able to live with that?
I'm gonna try.
It's only the best of friends who stay long after the party's over to help clean up...
To cleanse the pain of a guilty conscience... to pick up the pieces... of a broken marriage...
To sweep away the loneliness of keeping a secret.
Yes...
It's good to have friends who help clean up our messes.
But every housewife knows that as soon as one mess is taken care of... another one appears.
And we may find ourselves... right back where we started.
Previously on...
I wanna get things right this time.
Bree's relationship with detective Vance got serious.
What are we gonna say to people?
Tom and Lynette decided to separate.
We shouldn't tell anyone until we tell the kids.
Oh, god.
The kids.
Sit down.
Ow!
Gaby's stepfather returned to terrorize her again...
I remember those nights in your room, baby.
No!
Stop.
Until Carlos stopped him... permanently.
Gaby?
What happened?
- I killed him.
- And now he's gonna go to jail because he was trying to protect me.
Calm down.
We just need time to think.
We don't have time.
Yes, there was the dinner party.
Everybody's coming.
Including your boyfriend the detective.
I killed the son of a bitch who hurt my wife.
If I have to go to prison, I will.
That's not gonna happen.
Every hostess knows there's work to be done after the guests leave a party.
And only the best of friends will stay long after the party's over... to help clean up the mess.
They help with the heavy lifting... they work together to lighten the load.
They take on the most unpleasant tasks.
And, of course, there's no task more unpleasant than getting rid of an unwanted guest.
I should go move the car off the trail.
You gonna be okay?
Is this happening?
Are we really doing this?
Everyone stay focused.
The hardest part is over.
Now all we have to do is fill this in.
Oh, my god.
I thought I got everything.
No.
No, you missed the phone.
And if you missed that, what else did you miss?
Susan, it's gonna be okay.
How is it going to be okay?
Someone is calling the dead guy.
- "Home."
- See?
He has a home... with people who care about him, people who are going to come looking for him, leading them straight to us.
What do you want us to do?
It's not too late.
We... we could still go to the police.
And send my husband back to prison?
This time for murder?
No, not necessarily.
It was self-defense.
He broke into your house.
He threatened you.
We could explain that.
Yeah, then we can explain how we dumped him in a trunk, ate some cheesecake, and buried him in the woods!
We are going to get caught.
People always get caught.
We can't do this.
We're not criminals.
We drive carpool.
That's enough.
This is a very bad man.
He attacked our friend, and her husband protected her, and now we are gonna protect them.
That means we tell no one.
Not the police... not our families.
No one.
When we bury the body, we bury the secret forever.
Susan?
Yes, it's only the best of friends who stay long after the party's over to help clean up the mess...
Even when that mess may be bigger than they bargained for.
It has been said that change doesn't happen overnight, but over the course of month, it's amazing how much the ground can shift beneath us.
A woman who helped conceal a crime is now sleeping with a detective.
A man who used to look forward to bedtime... is now finding himself dreading it.
A woman who once told her husband everything is now keeping a terrible secret.
And a couple who have decided to separate is now going to great lengths to show that nothing has changed.
Crap!
Crap!
Crap!
Crap!
Aah!
Son of a...
Hey, hey, hey, guys!
Got up early, so I figured, what the heck?
I'll go get your mom some coffee...
the good stuff.
She deserves it.
She needs it, too.
I didn't sleep last night.
But you would know that.
You were there.
Do not drink this.
It's been in my car for three days.
Where are your shoes, dad?
It's casual friday.
Casual thursday.
Come on.
We're gonna miss the bus.
See ya later.
I'll see ya at dinner.
Love you.
God, I practically lost a toe out there.
It wouldn't have happened if you hadn't overslept.
Yeah, well, you know, you took the good alarm clock along with the good pillow and the house.
This is ridiculous.
We have to tell the kids we've separated.
We will, but this weekend is Gaby's big barbecue, and I don't wanna ruin it for them.
Yeah, and last weekend, you didn't wanna ruin the basketball tournament.
The weekend before that, Penny's birthday.
Come on, Lynette.
Are you sure this is about the kids?
What else would it be?
No, Tom, nothing's changed.
We still need time away from each other.
Yeah, I agree.
We got a lot of problems to work out, so why can't we tell the kids?
I just think they deserve one more happy weekend before we tear this family apart.
You know what?
You're...
Paige is up.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Don't take this the wrong way, but you could do this professionally.
Coming from a man who's on a first-name basis with half the hookers in Fairview, that's quite a compliment, detective.
Hey, I was thinking maybe this weekend, we could head up to that place in the mountains, just the two of us.
Oh, that sounds lovely, but Gaby is having her annual barbecue on saturday.
Am I invited?
Of course you are.
Why wouldn't you be?
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe because your friends don't like me.
What?
You are imagining things.
It's true.
They don't talk to me.
They don't make eye contact.
It's been that way for weeks, ever since the night of the dinner party.
Why...
Uh, why would you say that?
Bree, I'm a cop.
I got an eye for human behavior.
That was when everything changed.
I just can't figure out why.
I keep going over that night, hour by hour.
Well, stop... going over that night, because everything is fine.
The girls are just as crazy about you as I am.
I don't know.
I'm not feeling it.
Well...
Are you feeling this?
Bree, I know what's going on.
You're trying to distract me with sex, and if that's the case...
Mmm.
Bring it on.
Wake up!
I made you waffles.
Come back when you learn how to make mimosas.
Come on!
I left Celia alone with them.
There won't be any left.
Damn it, Juanita!
That's enough!
Get outta here now!
Carlos!
Juanita, honey, I'm sorry!
Why have you been so short-tempered lately?
Gosh, I don't know.
Maybe I'm upset about my golf swing or the economy... or maybe it's because I killed a guy.
Look, I get it, okay?
But we have to move on with our lives.
Don't you think I want to?
I just can't stop thinking about this.
No matter what I do, it's this horrible thing that is always there.
I need to talk to someone.
I know a guy named Tom Collins.
He's a great listener.
I meant father Dugan.
Okay, are you crazy?
You can't tell anyone.
That's too risky.
A priest can't share what you say in confession.
Are you sure he's not just gonna make you feel guiltier?
I mean, that's their thing.
Fine.
We'll go see the priest.
I have to.
I'm turning into a terrible husband, father.
I need to get this off my conscience.
It's tearing me apart.
Susan.
What are you doing?
Oh.
I was looking out the window, and I noticed dust in the corner of each windowpane.
It's been driving me nuts.
Okay.
What's going on with you?
What do you mean?
Well, there's a lot of weird stuff you like to do in the bedroom, but cleaning... not so much.
Couldn't sleep.
Yeah, that's been happening a lot lately.
You don't sleep.
You don't eat.
You never leave the house.
That's not true.
I'm substitute teaching today.
And that's great, but...
Did you have a fight with the girls?
What?
Why would you say that?
Well, a month ago, you were so excited to move back to the lane, and now you never see 'em.
There's... no coffee, no poker, no... bitching about husbands over coffee and poker.
The girls and I are fine.
Then what is it?
Come on, Susan.
It's me.
You can tell me anything.
I'm going for a run.
Susan.
Well, you said I should get out of the house more.
Hey.
So what do we know about the new guy?
Definitely rich.
Check out the car.
Definitely single.
Check out the fish.
Rich and single...
I wonder what he looks like.
You rarely get the trifecta.
What's your guess?
Wonky eye?
Rabbit teeth?
Comb-over?
One normal eyebrow, one really big one?
Baby hands?
I had it all on one guy.
Did not end well.
Well, I actually saw our new neighbor this morning.
Hmm. 6'1". 190.
He was wearing this great-looking pair of jeans.
And let me just say,
I can tell you one thing that isn't wonky.
Gaby.
Oh, come on.
I'm married.
I'm not dead.
Can still imagine all the dirty things I'd do to him.
- Like what?
- Oh, god!
Oh!
I didn't know you were...
I'm Susan Delfino.
Ah.
Nice to meet you.
Ben Faulkner.
Hi.
Well, I'm actually 6'2", and I haven't been 190 since I played rugby, but, uh, thank you.
Uh, and as for the jeans, you know, I could never figure out why they would cost 200 bucks.
Now I know.
Ladies, excuse me.
- Oh.
Okay.
- Thanks.
Welcome.
Dibs.
Look who's out.
Hey, Susan!
Uh, would you like to join us for coffee?
!
Uh, sorry.
I can't talk.
I'm subbing today!
Can't be late!
Is anyone talking to her?
I tried.
She's not returning my calls.
Same here.
She's obviously avoiding us.
I'm telling you, that is one loose cannon.
Well, we have got to get her back in the fold.
This is too risky.
Says the woman who's dating a cop.
Did it ever occur to you that it might be good to keep him close?
If there's ever an investigation,
I will be the first to know.
I'm doing this for us.
He's that good in the sack?
You have no idea.
And when you finish your worksheets on ladybugs, we will go outside and see if we can find some.
Susan, how's it going?
Good.
It's nice to be back.
To be honest,
I've been feeling a little down lately.
This is just what I needed.
Mrs. Delfino?
Cupcake's not moving.
She's probably sleeping, honey.
No, I poked her with my pencil a couple times.
She is d-e-a dead.
Uh... it's okay, kids.
I know what to do.
Oh, my god.
What do I do?
There's a little spot in the garden where we bury the class pets.
- Bury?
- Yeah.
Have a little funeral.
Say a few words.
Just don't mention god.
Amanda's parents are atheists, lawyers, and major douches.
Bless me, father, for I have sinned.
It's been a while since my last confession.
Continue, my son.
"My son." I'm sorry.
It's just you're, like, a thousand years older than me.
Who are you and where's father Dugan?
Leaving on sabbatical.
Fun for him and fun for me.
This is my first week of confessions.
It is?
Yeah, and, man, the things I've heard.
There was a lady yesterday who...
No, no, no, I can't say it.
I think I'll come back.
Unh-unh.
No.
You're not going anywhere.
I told you to wait in the car.
Don't snap at me.
That's why we're here.
You keep saying you wanna talk to someone, so talk to this guy.
He seems perfectly... enthusiastic.
He's 12 years old.
This will blow his collar off.
Oh, man, this must be awesome.
I'm so bummed I can't tweet anymore.
Sorry.
If it's not father Dugan, I'm not doing this.
No...
let's go.
Nuts.
I was really hoping this would be a good one.
I made out with two chicks once in college.
This job rocks!
Uh...
I don't know if you've ever buried anything before, but you have to dig a hole.
Right.
Of course.
I knew that.
It's funny the way life works out sometimes, isn't it?
I mean, I wasn't even supposed to be here today.
Once again, in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Now I have to carry this around with me for the rest of my life.
Don't be sad, Mrs. Delfino.
Cupcake was kind of a bad hamster.
She had three babies and ate them.
But does that mean she deserved to die?
We don't get to make that call, Juanita.
We're not god.
That's right, Amanda.
I said it.
What have I done?
It's not your fault.
I know it's not my fault, but try telling that to Cupcake's family when they show up looking for her.
There.
We're done.
Now let's all slap on a happy face and pretend like this never happened.
Can I come in?
I'm really not feeling like drinking right now.
Great.
Mmm.
So... were you two close?
Pardon?
You and Cupcake.
Juanita told me what happened.
I assume you two had a long history, went to college together, backpacked through Europe.
It just sort of hit me in a weird way.
I'm worried about you.
First, you stop talking to your friends.
Now you're wigging out at a rat funeral.
You're making me nervous.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not handling accessory to murder as well as the rest of you.
Susan, I'm begging you.
This is my husband's life we're talking about.
If anything were to happen to him, think of what would happen to me and my girls.
I know you're having a hard time, but please hold it together.
I'm trying.
Try harder.
Bree?
Do I smell...
Yes, white chocolate macadamia nut...
your favorite.
Oh!
Now you're my favorite.
Mwah.
Hmm.
How was your day?
Terrific.
I found a dead body.
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.
You don't wanna hear about this.
No, I do.
Your work is fascinating.
So, um, where exactly did you find this body?
Warehouse out by the docks.
So now I'm a big hero because I cracked a case those poor bastards in New haven P.D.
have been working on for months.
Oh, good for you.
Mm.
I got lucky.
All I did was spot a sedan with Connecticut plates, and I asked myself, "Who owns that car?"
The dead man had a car.
Exactly.
The killers did everything right, but they forgot to get rid of the victim's ride.
What idiots.
Mm-hmm.
So you kept his keys, but it never occurred to you he might have a car.
I just threw all his stuff in our safe.
I didn't spend a lot of time thinking about it.
There it is.
Drop it off in a bad part of town, and let social decay... take its course.
Oh, god, do you have to tidy up?
Get in.
If anybody catches us in this car, we're dead.
Oh, no, it's a stick.
I can't drive a stick.
Can you?
I did once in high school.
It's easy.
Just one extra pedal.
Oh.
It was easier when I was drunk.
What should I do?
Should I gun it?
Gun it?
You can't even drive it.
I thought that was you.
- Chuck.
Look, Gaby, it's Chuck.
- Mm.
I-I saw you were struggling.
Whose car is this?
- My aunt's.
- My friend's.
Her aunt and my friend.
Aunt Shirley.
She, uh, came over to my place last night for book club, and...
She had too much to drink.
Classic Shirley.
So we told her we'd bring her car back today.
- In fact, she's waiting for us, so we should scoot.
- Yeah.
No way.
- I'll drive.
- What?
The way you guys are going, you're gonna kill someone.
Go, Bob.
I'll meet you back at the station.
Oh, no, Bob, Bob, don't go!
Bob?
Oh.
Well...
Okay, a road trip in this neat old car with your cop boyfriend.
Fun.
So where does Shirley live?
Yeah, Bree, where does she live?
Why are you asking me?
She's your aunt.
Just keep driving.
I'll tell you when to turn.
Huh.
That's interesting.
No, it's not.
I mean... what is?
Oklahoma city redhawks.
Is your aunt a fan?
Oh, yeah, Shirley loves that... uh... sport.
And... men's cologne?
She's a lesbian.
Yeah.
She could've been married, but, no, she's a lesbian.
So, this, um, aunt or... friend, who's a men's cologne-wearing lesbian... she also likes to chew tobacco?
'Cause I never met a woman who likes to chew... ever.
I chew tobacco.
And I'm a woman.
Yeah.
Mmm.
All that's missing is a glass of chardonnay.
I keep telling her to quit.
"Do you want mouth cancer?" I say, but she won't listen.
You okay?
Yeah.
Ugh!
No.
Pull over.
Now.
Sorry!
Shirley likes plain.
I prefer chocolate.
Oh!
Get out.
What?
I'm taking your car.
Oh, my god.
I could kiss you!
What?
What are you...
Just get out!
Shh!
Keep your voice down.
That man over there is a cop.
A cop?
No!
Get back in here.
When you start something, young man, you see it through.
Buckle up!
Hey, what happened?
Shirley.
Just happened to be walking by.
Isn't that a stroke of luck?
So do you think your friend Bob could give us a ride home?
Sure.
I'll...
I'll call him.
So how's that dating a cop while covering up a murder working out for you?
Hey, Renee.
Ladies.
Don't distract them.
They have an important job to do.
I'm gonna go see the new neighbor.
You know, give him a ride on the ol' welcome wagon.
Wow, that was fast.
- I didn't know you two had even talked.
- We haven't.
So what makes you think he's gonna be interested?
Hear that, ladies?
Watch and learn.
I will show you some of my secrets.
Hi.
I'm gonna save us some time.
Look, I'm single.
You're single.
I'm hot.
You're hot.
Assuming you're not gay, and those shoes tell me you're not, we could do that thing where we flirt for a few weeks.
You can stare at my ass getting the mail, and I do get my mail four times a day.
Or you... could invite me in for... coffee...
Right now.
Thanks for the offer, but, uh, I'm good.
Um, when I said "coffee,"
you did know I meant sex, right?
Oh, you were subtle, but, uh, yeah.
I got it.
Wow.
You should write a book.
Otherwise, when you die, your secrets will die with you.
Father Dugan!
I'm so glad I caught you.
I don't know if you remember me.
Gabrielle Solis.
I assume you've come to apologize for taking a phone call during my easter sermon?
Oh!
I'm sorry, father.
But, you know, if you don't confirm those spa appointments, you lose 'em.
Yeah.
Um, anyway, I came here about Carlos.
He's in trouble, and he needs your help.
Well, I'd love to help Carlos.
He's a good man.
But I'm afraid you're too late.
What?
You were the one who kept blabbing in that sermon how it's never too late to confess your sins.
See?
I can listen and take calls.
It's true.
God waits until the heart is ready.
But the airlines are a little stricter, and I'm not going overseas in a middle seat.
So if you'll excuse me.
You getting on, too, miss?
Uh, yes, but I couldn't... manage my bag.
Be a dear and grab it for me?
Hey.
What are you doing?
Taking you to the airport... with one quick detour.
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Are you crazy?
I can't miss my plane.
Well, I'm sorry if I'm trying to get you to do god's work instead of going on your dream vacation to...
Rwanda, where I'll be digging wells... for lepers.
Well, your little friends are gonna have to wait.
- Excuse me.
- Whoa.
Well, where did you u me from?
We're headed off on our honeymoon.
And we can't have any detours.
They say you have to get to the airport three hours early for international flights.
Oh, honey, relax.
Since we caught Bin Laden, you can stroll on the plane anytime you want.
It's just, I've done something, father,
And I'm afraid that it's... unforgivable.
God can forgive us for anything.
Really?
Anything?
Yes.
If we're willing to show that we are truly repentant.
How?
Well, it's not by what we say.
It's by what we do.
For instance, if we were talking about a crime... then confessing to the authorities would prove the intentions of our heart.
That... is not an option.
There are other people involved...
innocent people.
You can't ask to be absolved for a sin that you intend to keep hidden.
You should go.
You're gonna miss your flight.
I don't wanna leave you, Carlos, not till I'm sure that you're gonna be okay.
Father Dugan, I don't see any way that I am ever going to be okay.
Hey.
Hey.
I wish I could make you stop thinking about this.
Yeah, me, too.
I don't even know what I was looking for.
There is no absolution for this thing.
I just have to live with it.
Every noise I'd hear at night, it was him.
Every dark alley I passed, he was waiting for me.
When I'd lie in bed,
I was afraid he'd come find me.
He was in my dreams... and in my nightmares.
I couldn't escape him.
And that's what I had to live with... until now.
For the first time, I'm not scared.
You did that for me.
Yeah... by taking a man's life.
Yes, you may have taken a life, but you also saved one.
So if it's absolution you're looking for...
I give it to you.
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, is everything okay with the kids?
Yeah, yeah, the...
the kids are fine.
I just...
What?
Did something happen?
I really... need you right now.
Okay.
Morning.
Morning.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Crap, crap, crap.
- Come on.
Come on.
- Okay.
- Watch out for the, uh...
- Okay, okay, o...
- Honey.
Ooh.
- No, I'm okay.
Okay, go.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
They're still asleep.
Thank god.
I'll start the coffee.
Okay, you read my mind.
- Hey.
- Yeah?
So last night...
Yeah.
We should talk about it.
Uh-huh.
I mean...
If you wanna get back together...
I'm open to that.
But we have some serious problems that are gonna require serious work.
Oh, god.
Last night... uh... was... not about getting back together.
Then what the hell was it about?
I...
I had a nightmare.
Well... a-a nightmare?
Are you kidding me?
You've gotta understand.
I'm having a lot of nightmares.
This is such a scary time, and I really need you.
That's-that's why I didn't want to tell the kids.
Having you across the street makes me feel safe.
You're unbelievable.
You know what you do when you're scared, Lynette?
You buy a night-light.
You don't go have sex with the guy you are supposed to be separated from!
I want french toast.
- I hate french toast.
I want pancakes.
- Oh.
Kids... there's something your mom and I need to tell you.
Yeah.
Why don't we sit down?
Hey, I, uh, I know it's a barbecue, but isn't that a little casual?
Yeah, um,
I don't think I'm gonna go this year.
Why don't you go without me?
Hey, do I need to be worried?
I told you.
I'm fine.
I don't mean worried about you.
I mean worried about us.
I thought this was some problem between you and your friends, but... the way you've been shutting me out,
I'm starting to think you've got a problem with me.
How could you say that?
No matter what I'm going through,
I would never let anything come between us.
Yeah, I'm sure Tom and Lynette felt the same way.
Look where they ended up.
Well, I'm headed over there without you.
No.
I'm going with you.
You're right.
I do have a problem with the girls.
It's about time I went over there and straightened it out.
No!
No way.
You are not bringing Mike in on this.
He's not gonna tell anyone.
We can trust him.
Oh, just like I could trust you when we agreed to keep this between us?
Susan, we all empathize with your position, but I don't think it's smart to tell Mike.
Well, he knows something is up.
It's affecting our marriage.
You know what's gonna affect my marriage?
when my husband goes to prison.
I think we should let her tell him.
I can't believe this.
We all made a pact that night.
I don't remember anybody bringing up
These extra conditions.
Well, you weren't exactly asking anyone's opinion that night, were you, Bree?
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you elected yourself chairman of the... dead guy committee and started making decisions for everyone.
Like you always do.
Well, somebody had to, Susan,
And it sure as hell wasn't gonna be you.
I'm done talking about this.
The only reason I came to this barbecue was to let you know that I am telling Mike.
The hell you are.
Aah!
Oh, my god!
Gaby!
Gaby!
- Trade Manning?
- What, are you out of your mind?
Think for a minute.
When is his stock ever gonna be higher?
Let me go!
You could get a great player.
Yeah, maybe a great quarterback, like, I don't know.
Manning?
- Ow!
- Get off me!
Girls, people can hear us!
Ow!
I told you we couldn't trust her!
I can't see.
Lynette!
Aah!
Oh!
I got it!
What the hell's going on?
Uh, well...
I...
lost my earring, and the girls here were kind enough to help me look for it.
Oh!
There it is!
I went food shopping yesterday.
I kept having to put things back.
I'd take a couple of cans of peaches.
And then I'd remember that Tom was the only one who liked them, put them back.
Sweet pickles...
Tom.
Put them back.
I am so sorry.
With everything that's been going on,
I haven't been there for you.
I guess we've all been guilty of that.
I'm sorry, Susan.
This is so damn hard.
You know, the good thing about Mike and Tom not knowing is they can't be implicated.
If something were to happen, at least they'd be okay.
We are never gonna be able to tell anybody about this, are we?
No.
Are you gonna be able to live with that?
I'm gonna try.
It's only the best of friends who stay long after the party's over to help clean up...
To cleanse the pain of a guilty conscience... to pick up the pieces... of a broken marriage...
To sweep away the loneliness of keeping a secret.
Yes...
It's good to have friends who help clean up our messes.
But every housewife knows that as soon as one mess is taken care of... another one appears.
And we may find ourselves... right back where we started.
Previously on Desperate Housewives.
I want to get things right this time.
Bree's relationship with Detective Vance got serious.
What are we gonna say to people?
Tom and Lynette decided to separate.
And we shouldn't tell anyone until we tell the kids.
Oh, God, the kids.
Sit down.
Gabby's stepfather returned to terrorize her again.
I remember those nights in your room, baby.
No.
Stop.
Until Carlos stopped him permanently.
Gabby...
What happened?
I killed him.
And now he's gonna go to jail because he was trying to protect me.
Calm down.
We just need time to think.
We don't have time.
Yes.
There was the dinner party.
Everybody's coming.
Including your boyfriend, the detective.
I killed the son of a bitch who hurt my wife.
If I have to go to prison, I will.
That's not gonna happen.
Every hostess knows there's work to be done after the guests leave a party.
And only the best of friends will stay long after the party's over to help clean up the mess.
They help with the heavy lifting.
They work together to lighten the load.
They take on the most unpleasant tasks.
And, of course, there's no task more unpleasant than getting rid of an unwanted guest.
I should go move the car off the trail.
Are you gonna be okay?
Is this happening?
Are we really doing this?
Everyone stay focused.
The hardest part is over.
Now all we have to do is fill this in.
Oh, my God.
I thought I got everything.
No!
No, you missed the phone.
And if you missed that, what else did you miss?
Susan, it's gonna be okay.
How is it going to be okay?
Someone is calling the dead guy!
- "Home."
- See?
He has a home.
With people who care about him, people who are going to come looking for him, leading them straight to us.
What do you want us to do?
It's not too late.
We could still go to the police.
And send my husband back to prison?
This time for murder?
No, not necessarily.
It was self-defense.
He broke into your house, he threatened you.
We could explain that.
Yeah, and we can explain how we dumped him in a trunk, ate some cheesecake, and buried him in the woods!
We are going to get caught.
People always get caught!
We can't do this.
We're not criminals!
We drive carpool!
That's enough!
This is a very bad man.
He attacked our friend, and her husband protected her, and now, we are gonna protect them.
That means we tell no one.
Not the police.
Not our families.
No one.
And we bury the body, we bury the secret, forever.
Susan?
Yes, it's only the best of friends who stay long after the party's over to help clean up the mess.
Even when that mess may be bigger than they bargained for.
It has been said that change doesn't happen overnight.
But over the course of a month, it's amazing how much the ground can shift beneath us.
A woman who helped conceal a crime is now sleeping with a detective.
A man who used to look forward to bedtime is now finding himself dreading it.
A woman who once told her husband everything is now keeping a terrible secret.
And a couple who've decided to separate is now going to great lengths to show that nothing has changed.
Crap, crap, crap!
Crap!
Son of a...
Hey, guys.
I got up early, so I figured, what the heck,
I'll go get your mom some coffee, the good stuff.
She deserves it.
She needs it, too.
I didn't sleep last night.
But you would know that, you were there.
Do not drink this.
It's been in my car for three days.
Where are your shoes, Dad?
It's Casual Friday.
Casual Thursday.
Come on.
We're gonna miss the bus.
See you later.
I'll see you at dinner.
Love you.
God, I practically lost a toe out there.
It wouldn't have happened if you hadn't overslept.
Yeah, well, you know, you took the good alarm clock, along with the good pillow, and the house.
This is ridiculous.
We have to tell the kids we've separated.
We will, but this weekend is Gabby's big barbecue and I don't want to ruin it for them.
Yeah, and last weekend, you didn't want to ruin the basketball tournament.
The weekend before that, Penny's birthday.
Come on.
Lynette, are you sure this is about the kids?
What else would it be?
No, Tom, nothing's changed.
We still need some time away from each other.
Yeah.
I agree.
We've got a lot of problems to work out.
So why can't we tell the kids?
I just think they deserve one more happy weekend before we tear this family apart.
You know what?
You're...
Paige is up.
Don't take this the wrong way, but you could do this professionally.
Coming from a man who's on a first-name basis with half the hookers in Fairview, that's quite a compliment, Detective.
Hey, I was thinking, maybe this weekend we could head up to that place in the mountains, just the two of us.
That sounds lovely, but Gabby is having her annual barbecue on Saturday.
Am I invited?
Of course you are.
Why wouldn't you be?
Oh, I don't know, maybe because your friends don't like me.
What?
You are imagining things.
It's true.
They don't talk to me, they don't make eye contact.
It's been that way for weeks.
Ever since the night of the dinner party.
Why...
Why would you say that?
Bree, I'm a cop.
I've got an eye for human behavior.
And that was when everything changed.
I just can't figure out why.
I keep going over that night, hour by hour.
Well, stop going over that night, because everything is fine.
The girls are just as crazy about you as I am.
I don't know.
I'm not feeling it.
Well, are you feeling this?
Oh.
Bree, I know what's going on.
You're trying to distract me with sex.
And if that's the case, bring it on.
Wake up!
I made you waffles.
Come back when you learn how to make mimosas.
Come on.
I left Celia alone with them.
There won't be any left.
Damn it, Juanita, that's enough!
Get out of here!
Now!
Carlos!
Juanita, honey, I'm sorry.
Why have you been so short-tempered lately?
Gosh, I don't know.
Maybe I'm upset about my golf swing, or the economy.
Or maybe it's because I killed a guy!
Look, I get it, okay?
But we have to move on with our lives.
Don't you think I want to?
I just can't stop thinking about this.
No matter what I do, it's this horrible thing that is always there.
I need to talk to someone.
I know a guy named Tom Collins.
He's a great listener.
I meant Father Dugan.
Okay, are you crazy?
You can't tell anyone.
That's too risky!
A priest can't share what you say in confession.
Are you sure he's not just gonna make you feel guiltier?
I mean, that's their thing.
Fine, we'll go see the priest.
I have to.
I'm turning into a terrible husband, father.
I need to get this off my conscience.
It's tearing me apart.
Susan, what are you doing?
I was looking out the window and I noticed dust in the corner of each windowpane.
It's been driving me nuts.
Okay, what's going on with you?
What do you mean?
Well, there's a lot of weird stuff you like to do in the bedroom, but cleaning?
Not so much.
Couldn't sleep.
Yeah, that's been happening a lot lately.
You don't sleep, you don't eat, you never leave the house.
That's not true.
I'm substitute teaching today.
And that's great, but...
Did you have a fight with the girls?
What?
Why would you say that?
Well, like a month ago, you were so excited to move back to the Lane, and now you never see them.
There's no coffee, no poker, no bitching about husbands over coffee and poker.
The girls and I are fine.
Then what is it?
Come on, Susan, it's me.
You can tell me anything.
I'm going for a run.
Susan.
What?
You said I should get out of the house more.
Hey.
So what do we know about the new guy?
Definitely rich.
Check out the car.
Definitely single.
Check out the fish.
Rich and single.
I wonder what he looks like.
You rarely get the trifecta.
What's your guess?
Wonky eye?
Rabbit teeth?
Comb-over?
One normal eyebrow, one really big one?
Baby hands?
I had it all on one guy.
Did not end well.
Well, I actually saw our new neighbor this morning.
6'1 ", 190, he was wearing this great-looking pair of jeans.
And let me just say, I can tell you one thing that isn't wonky.
Gabby...
Oh, come on!
I'm married, I'm not dead.
I can still imagine all the dirty things I'd do to him.
- Like what?
- Oh, God!
Oh!
I didn't know you...
I'm Susan Delfino.
Nice to meet you.
Ben Faulkner.
Hi.
And, well, I'm actually 6'2", and I haven't been 190 since I played rugby, but thank you.
And as for the jeans, you know, I could never figure out why they cost 200 bucks.
Now I know.
Ladies.
Excuse me.
- Yes, okay.
- Thanks.
Welcome.
Dibs.
Look who's out.
Hey, Susan!
Would you like to join us for coffee?
Sorry, I can't talk.
I'm subbing today.
Can't be late.
Is anyone talking to her?
I tried.
She's not returning my calls.
Same here.
She's obviously avoiding us.
I'm telling you, that is one loose cannon.
Well, we have got to get her back in the fold.
This is too risky.
Says the woman who's dating the cop.
Did it ever occur to you that it might be good to keep him close?
If there's ever an investigation, I will be the first to know.
I'm doing this for us.
He's that good in the sack?
You have no idea.
And when you finish your worksheets on ladybugs, we will go outside and see if we can find some.
Susan, how's it going?
Good.
It's nice to be back.
To be honest, I've been feeling a little down lately.
This is just what I needed.
Mrs. Delfino?
Cupcake's not moving.
She's probably sleeping, honey.
No, I poked her with my pencil a couple of times.
She's D-E-A dead.
Oh, no!
It's okay, kids.
I know what to do.
Oh, my God.
What do I do?
There's a little spot in the garden where we bury the class pets.
- Bury?
- Yeah.
Have a little funeral, say a few words.
Just don't mention God.
Amanda's parents are atheists, lawyers, and major douches.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been a while since my last confession.
Continue, my son.
"My son." I'm sorry.
It's just you're, like, a thousand years older than me.
Who are you and where's Father Dugan?
Leaving on sabbatical.
Fun for him and fun for me.
This is my first week of confessions.
It is?
Yeah.
And man, the things I've heard.
There was a lady yesterday who...
No, no, no.
I can't say it.
I think I'll come back.
Uh-uh, no.
You're not going anywhere.
I told you to wait in the car.
Don't snap at me.
That's why we're here.
You keep saying you wanna talk to someone, so talk to this guy.
He seems perfectly enthusiastic.
He's 12 years old.
This will blow his collar off.
Oh, man.
This must be awesome.
I'm so bummed I can't tweet anymore.
Sorry, if it's not Father Dugan, I'm not doing this.
- What?
No...
- Let's go.
Nuts.
I was really hoping this would be a good one.
I made out with two chicks once in college.
This job rocks!
I don't know if you've ever buried anything before, but you have to dig a hole.
Right.
Of course.
I knew that.
It's funny the way life works out sometimes, isn't it?
I mean, I wasn't even supposed to be here today.
Once again, in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Now I have to carry this around with me for the rest of my life.
Don't be sad, Mrs. Delfino.
Cupcake was kind of a bad hamster.
She had three babies and ate them.
But does that mean she deserved to die?
We don't get to make that call, Juanita.
We're not God.
That's right, Amanda, I said it.
What have I done?
It's not your fault.
I know it's not my fault, but try telling that to Cupcake's family when they show up looking for her!
There.
We're done.
Now let's all slap on a happy face and pretend like this never happened.
Can I come in?
I'm really not feeling like drinking right now.
Great.
So, were you two close?
Pardon?
You and Cupcake.
Juanita told me what happened.
I assume you two had a long history.
Went to college together, backpacked through Europe.
It just sort of hit me in a weird way.
I'm worried about you.
First you stop talking to your friends.
Now you're wigging out at a rat funeral.
You're making me nervous.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not handling accessory to murder as well as the rest of you.
Susan, I'm begging you.
This is my husband's life we're talking about.
If anything were to happen to him, think what would happen to me and my girls.
I know you're having a hard time, but please, hold it together.
I'm trying.
Try harder.
Bree?
Do I smell...
White chocolate macadamia nut.
Your favorite.
Oh!
Now you're my favorite.
How was your day?
Terrific.
I found a dead body.
I'm sorry, you don't want to hear about this.
No, I do.
Your work is fascinating.
So, where exactly did you find this body?
Warehouse out by the docks.
So now, I'm a big hero because I cracked a case those poor bastards at New Haven PD have been working on for months.
Good for you.
I got lucky.
All I did was spot a sedan with Connecticut plates and a bunch of tickets on the windshield, and I asked myself, "Who owns that car?"
- The dead man had a car.
- Exactly.
The killers did everything right, but they forgot to get rid of the victim's ride.
What idiots.
So you kept his keys, but it never occurred to you he might have a car?
I just threw all his stuff in our safe.
I didn't spend a lot of time thinking about it.
There it is.
Okay, what's our plan?
Drop it off in a bad part of town and let social decay take its course.
Oh, God, do you have to tidy up?
Get in!
Anybody catches us in this car, we're dead.
Oh, no, it's a stick!
I can't drive a stick.
Can you?
I did once in high school.
It's easy.
Just one extra pedal.
This looked easier when I was drunk.
Oh, my God!
What should I do?
Should I gun it?
Gun it?
You can't even drive it!
I thought that was you.
Chuck!
Look, Gabby, it's Chuck.
I saw you were struggling.
Whose car is it?
- My aunt's.
- My friend's.
Her aunt, and my friend.
Aunt Shirley.
She came over to my place last night for book club and...
She had too much to drink.
Classic Shirley.
So, we told her we'd bring her car back today.
In fact, she's waiting for us, so we should scoot.
- Yeah.
- No way.
I'll drive.
What?
The way you guys are going, you're gonna kill someone.
Go, Bob.
I'll meet you back at the station.
No, Bob.
Bob, don't go!
Bob?
Well.
Okay, a road trip in this neat old car with your cop boyfriend.
Fun!
So, where does Shirley live?
Yeah, Bree.
Where does she live?
Why are you asking me?
She's your aunt.
Just keep driving.
I'll tell you when to turn.
Ha!
That's interesting.
No, it's not!
I mean, what is?
Oklahoma City Red Hawks.
Is your aunt a fan?
Oh, yeah.
Shirley loves that sport.
And men's cologne?
She's a lesbian.
She could've been married, but no, she's a lesbian.
So this aunt, or friend, who's a men's-cologne-wearing lesbian, she also likes to chew tobacco?
'Cause I've never met a woman who likes to chew.
Ever.
I chew tobacco.
And I'm a woman.
Yeah.
Mmm.
Mmm.
All that is missing is a glass of Chardonnay.
I keep telling her to quit.
"Do you want mouth cancer?" I say, but she won't listen.
You okay?
Yeah.
No.
Pull over.
Now.
Sorry.
Shirley likes plain, I prefer chocolate.
Oh!
- Get out!
- What?
I'm taking your car!
Oh, my God, I could kiss you!
What?
What are you...
Just get out!
Shh.
Keep your voice down.
That man over there is a cop.
A cop?
Where?
Get back in here!
When you start something, young man, you see it through.
Buckle up!
Hey!
What happened?
Shirley!
Just happened to be walking by.
Isn't that a stroke of luck?
So, do you think your friend Bob could give us a ride home?
Sure.
I'll call him.
Okay.
So how's that "dating a cop while covering up a murder"
working out for you?
Hey, Renee.
Ladies.
Don't distract them.
They have an important job to do.
I'm gonna go see the new neighbor.
You know, give him a ride on the old welcome wagon.
Wow, that was fast.
I didn't know you two had even talked.
We haven't.
So what makes you think he's going to be interested?
Hear that, ladies?
Watch and learn.
I will show you some of my secrets.
Hi.
I'm gonna save us some time.
Look, I'm single, you're single.
I'm hot, you're hot.
Assuming you're not gay, and those shoes tell me you're not, we could do that thing where we flirt for a few weeks, you can stare at my ass getting the mail, and I do get my mail four times a day.
Or, you could invite me in for coffee right now.
Thanks for the offer, but I'm good.
Excuse me.
When I said "coffee," you did know I meant sex, right?
Oh, you were subtle, but, yeah, I got it.
Wow.
You should write a book.
Otherwise, when you die, your secrets will die with you.
Father Dugan!
So glad I caught you.
I don't know if you remember me.
Gabrielle Solis.
I assume you've come to apologize for taking a phone call during my Easter sermon?
I'm sorry, Father.
But, you know, if you don't confirm those spa appointments, you lose them.
Yeah.
Anyway, I came here about Carlos.
He's in trouble and he needs your help.
Well, I'd love to help Carlos.
He's a good man.
But I'm afraid you're too late.
What?
You were the one who kept blabbing in that sermon how it's never too late to confess your sins.
See?
I can listen and take calls.
That's true.
God waits until the heart is ready.
But the airlines are a little stricter.
And I am not going overseas in the middle seat.
So, if you'll excuse me.
You getting on too, Miss?
Yes, but I couldn't manage my bag.
Be a dear and grab it for me?
Hey!
What are you doing?
Taking you to the airport.
With one quick detour.
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Stop it!
Stop!
Are you crazy?
I can't miss my plane!
Well, I'm sorry if I'm trying to get you to do God's work, instead of going on your dream vacation to...
Rwanda.
Where I'll be digging wells.
For lepers.
Well, your little friends are gonna have to wait.
- Excuse me?
- Whoa!
Where did you come from?
We're headed off on our honeymoon.
And we can't have any detours.
They say you have to get to the airport three hours early for international flights.
Oh, honey, relax.
Since we caught Bin Laden, you can stroll on the plane anytime you want.
It's just, I've done something, Father, and I'm afraid that it's unforgivable.
God can forgive us for anything.
Really?
Anything?
Yes.
If we're willing to show that we are truly repentant.
How?
Well, it's not by what we say, it's by what we do.
For instance, if we were talking about a crime, then confessing to the authorities would prove the intentions of our heart.
That is not an option.
There are other people involved.
Innocent people.
You can't ask to be absolved for a sin that you intend to keep hidden.
You should go.
You're gonna miss your flight.
I don't wanna leave you, Carlos.
Not till I'm sure that you're gonna be okay.
Father Dugan, I don't see any way that I am ever going to be okay.
Hey.
Hey.
I wish I could make you stop thinking about this.
Yeah, me, too.
I don't even know what I was looking for.
There is no absolution for this thing.
I just have to live with it.
Every noise I'd hear at night, it was him.
Every dark alley I passed, he was waiting for me.
When I'd lie in bed, I was afraid he'd come find me.
He was in my dreams, in my nightmares.
I couldn't escape him.
That's what I had to live with.
Until now.
For the first time, I'm not scared.
And you did that for me.
Yeah.
By taking a man's life.
Yes, you may have taken a life, but you also saved one.
So if it's absolution you're looking for,
I give it to you.
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Is everything okay with the kids?
Yeah, yeah.
The kids are fine.
I just...
What?
Did something happen?
I really need you right now.
Okay.
Morning.
Morning.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
- Crap!
Crap!
Crap!
- Come on.
- Come on.
- Okay.
- Come on.
Watch out for the...
- Okay, okay.
- Honey.
- No, I'm okay.
Okay, go.
They're still asleep.
Thank God.
I'll start the coffee.
Okay.
You read my mind.
- Hey?
- Yeah.
So, last night...
Yeah.
We should talk about it.
Uh-huh.
I mean, if you want to get back together,
I'm open to that.
But we have some serious problems that are gonna require serious work.
Oh, God.
Last night
was not about getting back together.
Then what the hell was it about?
I had a nightmare.
A nightmare?
Are you kidding me?
You've gotta understand.
I'm having a lot of nightmares.
This is such a scary time and I really need you.
That's why I didn't want to tell the kids.
Having you across the street makes me feel safe.
You're unbelievable.
You know what you do when you're scared, Lynette?
You buy a night light.
You don't go have sex with the guy you are supposed to be separated from!
I want French toast.
I hate French toast.
I want pancakes.
Kids.
There's something your mom and I need to tell you.
Yeah.
Why don't we sit down?
Hey.
Hey, I know it's a barbecue, but isn't that a little casual?
Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna go this year.
Why don't you go without me?
Hey, do I need to be worried?
I told you, I'm fine.
I don't mean worried about you.
I mean worried about us.
I thought this was some problem between you and your friends.
But the way you've been shutting me out,
I'm starting to think you've got a problem with me.
How could you say that?
No matter what I'm going through,
I would never let anything come between us.
Yeah, I'm sure Tom and Lynette felt the same way.
Look where they ended up.
I'll head on over there without you.
No.
I'm going with you.
You were right.
I do have a problem with the girls.
It's about time I went over there and straightened it out.
No!
No way!
You are not bringing Mike in on this.
He's not gonna tell anyone.
We can trust him.
Just like I could trust you when we agreed to keep this between us?
Susan, we all empathize with your position, but I don't think it's smart to tell Mike.
Well, he knows something is up.
It's affecting our marriage.
You know what's going to affect my marriage?
When my husband goes to prison.
I think we should let her tell him.
I can't believe this.
We all made a pact that night.
I don't remember anybody bringing up these extra conditions.
Well, you weren't exactly asking anyone's opinions that night, were you, Bree?
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you elected yourself chairman of the dead guy committee and started making decisions for everyone.
Like you always do.
Well, somebody had to, Susan, and it sure as hell wasn't gonna be you.
I'm done talking about this.
The only reason I came to this barbecue was to let you know that I am telling Mike.
The hell you are!
- No!
- Oh, my God!
- Gabby, don't!
Gabby!
- Forget you!
Trade Manning?
What, are you out of your mind?
Think for a minute.
When is his stock ever gonna be higher?
- Let me go!
- My eyes!
- Susan!
- Let me go!
You could get a great player.
Yeah, maybe a great quarterback.
Like, I don't know, Manning?
- Ow!
Get off me!
- Girls!
People can hear us!
I told you we couldn't trust her!
- I can't see!
- Lynette!
Stop it!
What the hell is going on?
Well, I lost my earring, and the girls here were kind enough to help me look for it.
Oh, there it is!
I went food shopping yesterday.
I kept having to put things back.
I'd take a couple of cans of peaches, and then I'd remember that Tom was the only one who liked them.
Put them back.
Sweet pickles.
Tom.
Put them back.
I am so sorry.
With everything that's been going on, I haven't been there for you.
I guess we've all been guilty of that.
I'm sorry, Susan.
This is so damn hard.
You know, the good thing about Mike and Tom not knowing is they can't be implicated.
If something were to happen, at least they'd be okay.
We are never going to be able to tell anybody about this, are we?
No.
Are you gonna be able to live with that?
I'm gonna try.
It's only the best of friends who stay long after the party's over to help clean up.
To cleanse the pain of a guilty conscience.
To pick up the pieces of a broken marriage.
To sweep away the loneliness of keeping a secret.
Yes.
It's good to have friends who help clean up our messes.
But every housewife knows that as soon as one mess is taken care of, another one appears.
And we may find ourselves right back where we started.
Previously on...
I wanna get things right this time.
Bree's relationship with detective Vance got serious.
What are we gonna say to people?
Tom and Lynette decided to separate.
We shouldn't tell anyone until we tell the kids.
Oh, god.
The kids.
Sit down.
Ow!
Gaby's stepfather returned to terrorize her again...
I remember those nights in your room, baby.
No!
Stop.
Until Carlos stopped him... permanently.
Gaby?
What happened?
- I killed him.
- And now he's gonna go to jail because he was trying to protect me.
Calm down.
We just need time to think.
We don't have time.
Yes, there was the dinner party.
Everybody's coming.
Including your boyfriend the detective.
I killed the son of a bitch who hurt my wife.
If I have to go to prison, I will.
That's not gonna happen.
Every hostess knows there's work to be done after the guests leave a party.
And only the best of friends will stay long after the party's over... to help clean up the mess.
They help with the heavy lifting... they work together to lighten the load.
They take on the most unpleasant tasks.
And, of course, there's no task more unpleasant than getting rid of an unwanted guest.
I should go move the car off the trail.
You gonna be okay?
Is this happening?
Are we really doing this?
Everyone stay focused.
The hardest part is over.
Now all we have to do is fill this in.
Oh, my god.
I thought I got everything.
No.
No, you missed the phone.
And if you missed that, what else did you miss?
Susan, it's gonna be okay.
How is it going to be okay?
Someone is calling the dead guy.
- "Home."
- See?
He has a home... with people who care about him, people who are going to come looking for him, leading them straight to us.
What do you want us to do?
It's not too late.
We... we could still go to the police.
And send my husband back to prison?
This time for murder?
No, not necessarily.
It was self-defense.
He broke into your house.
He threatened you.
We could explain that.
Yeah, then we can explain how we dumped him in a trunk, ate some cheesecake, and buried him in the woods!
We are going to get caught.
People always get caught.
We can't do this.
We're not criminals.
We drive carpool.
That's enough.
This is a very bad man.
He attacked our friend, and her husband protected her, and now we are gonna protect them.
That means we tell no one.
Not the police... not our families.
No one.
When we bury the body, we bury the secret forever.
Susan?
Yes, it's only the best of friends who stay long after the party's over to help clean up the mess...
Even when that mess may be bigger than they bargained for.
It has been said that change doesn't happen overnight, but over the course of month, it's amazing how much the ground can shift beneath us.
A woman who helped conceal a crime is now sleeping with a detective.
A man who used to look forward to bedtime... is now finding himself dreading it.
A woman who once told her husband everything is now keeping a terrible secret.
And a couple who have decided to separate is now going to great lengths to show that nothing has changed.
Crap!
Crap!
Crap!
Crap!
Aah!
Son of a...
Hey, hey, hey, guys!
Got up early, so I figured, what the heck?
I'll go get your mom some coffee...
the good stuff.
She deserves it.
She needs it, too.
I didn't sleep last night.
But you would know that.
You were there.
Do not drink this.
It's been in my car for three days.
Where are your shoes, dad?
It's casual friday.
Casual thursday.
Come on.
We're gonna miss the bus.
See ya later.
I'll see ya at dinner.
Love you.
God, I practically lost a toe out there.
It wouldn't have happened if you hadn't overslept.
Yeah, well, you know, you took the good alarm clock along with the good pillow and the house.
This is ridiculous.
We have to tell the kids we've separated.
We will, but this weekend is Gaby's big barbecue, and I don't wanna ruin it for them.
Yeah, and last weekend, you didn't wanna ruin the basketball tournament.
The weekend before that, Penny's birthday.
Come on, Lynette.
Are you sure this is about the kids?
What else would it be?
No, Tom, nothing's changed.
We still need time away from each other.
Yeah, I agree.
We got a lot of problems to work out, so why can't we tell the kids?
I just think they deserve one more happy weekend before we tear this family apart.
You know what?
You're...
Paige is up.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Don't take this the wrong way, but you could do this professionally.
Coming from a man who's on a first-name basis with half the hookers in Fairview, that's quite a compliment, detective.
Hey, I was thinking maybe this weekend, we could head up to that place in the mountains, just the two of us.
Oh, that sounds lovely, but Gaby is having her annual barbecue on saturday.
Am I invited?
Of course you are.
Why wouldn't you be?
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe because your friends don't like me.
What?
You are imagining things.
It's true.
They don't talk to me.
They don't make eye contact.
It's been that way for weeks, ever since the night of the dinner party.
Why...
Uh, why would you say that?
Bree, I'm a cop.
I got an eye for human behavior.
That was when everything changed.
I just can't figure out why.
I keep going over that night, hour by hour.
Well, stop... going over that night, because everything is fine.
The girls are just as crazy about you as I am.
I don't know.
I'm not feeling it.
Well...
Are you feeling this?
Bree, I know what's going on.
You're trying to distract me with sex, and if that's the case...
Mmm.
Bring it on.
Wake up!
I made you waffles.
Come back when you learn how to make mimosas.
Come on!
I left Celia alone with them.
There won't be any left.
Damn it, Juanita!
That's enough!
Get outta here now!
Carlos!
Juanita, honey, I'm sorry!
Why have you been so short-tempered lately?
Gosh, I don't know.
Maybe I'm upset about my golf swing or the economy... or maybe it's because I killed a guy.
Look, I get it, okay?
But we have to move on with our lives.
Don't you think I want to?
I just can't stop thinking about this.
No matter what I do, it's this horrible thing that is always there.
I need to talk to someone.
I know a guy named Tom Collins.
He's a great listener.
I meant father Dugan.
Okay, are you crazy?
You can't tell anyone.
That's too risky.
A priest can't share what you say in confession.
Are you sure he's not just gonna make you feel guiltier?
I mean, that's their thing.
Fine.
We'll go see the priest.
I have to.
I'm turning into a terrible husband, father.
I need to get this off my conscience.
It's tearing me apart.
Susan.
What are you doing?
Oh.
I was looking out the window, and I noticed dust in the corner of each windowpane.
It's been driving me nuts.
Okay.
What's going on with you?
What do you mean?
Well, there's a lot of weird stuff you like to do in the bedroom, but cleaning... not so much.
Couldn't sleep.
Yeah, that's been happening a lot lately.
You don't sleep.
You don't eat.
You never leave the house.
That's not true.
I'm substitute teaching today.
And that's great, but...
Did you have a fight with the girls?
What?
Why would you say that?
Well, a month ago, you were so excited to move back to the lane, and now you never see 'em.
There's... no coffee, no poker, no... bitching about husbands over coffee and poker.
The girls and I are fine.
Then what is it?
Come on, Susan.
It's me.
You can tell me anything.
I'm going for a run.
Susan.
Well, you said I should get out of the house more.
Hey.
So what do we know about the new guy?
Definitely rich.
Check out the car.
Definitely single.
Check out the fish.
Rich and single...
I wonder what he looks like.
You rarely get the trifecta.
What's your guess?
Wonky eye?
Rabbit teeth?
Comb-over?
One normal eyebrow, one really big one?
Baby hands?
I had it all on one guy.
Did not end well.
Well, I actually saw our new neighbor this morning.
Hmm. 6'1". 190.
He was wearing this great-looking pair of jeans.
And let me just say,
I can tell you one thing that isn't wonky.
Gaby.
Oh, come on.
I'm married.
I'm not dead.
Can still imagine all the dirty things I'd do to him.
- Like what?
- Oh, god!
Oh!
I didn't know you were...
I'm Susan Delfino.
Ah.
Nice to meet you.
Ben Faulkner.
Hi.
Well, I'm actually 6'2", and I haven't been 190 since I played rugby, but, uh, thank you.
Uh, and as for the jeans, you know, I could never figure out why they would cost 200 bucks.
Now I know.
Ladies, excuse me.
- Oh.
Okay.
- Thanks.
Welcome.
Dibs.
Look who's out.
Hey, Susan!
Uh, would you like to join us for coffee?
!
Uh, sorry.
I can't talk.
I'm subbing today!
Can't be late!
Is anyone talking to her?
I tried.
She's not returning my calls.
Same here.
She's obviously avoiding us.
I'm telling you, that is one loose cannon.
Well, we have got to get her back in the fold.
This is too risky.
Says the woman who's dating a cop.
Did it ever occur to you that it might be good to keep him close?
If there's ever an investigation,
I will be the first to know.
I'm doing this for us.
He's that good in the sack?
You have no idea.
And when you finish your worksheets on ladybugs, we will go outside and see if we can find some.
Susan, how's it going?
Good.
It's nice to be back.
To be honest,
I've been feeling a little down lately.
This is just what I needed.
Mrs. Delfino?
Cupcake's not moving.
She's probably sleeping, honey.
No, I poked her with my pencil a couple times.
She is d-e-a dead.
Uh... it's okay, kids.
I know what to do.
Oh, my god.
What do I do?
There's a little spot in the garden where we bury the class pets.
- Bury?
- Yeah.
Have a little funeral.
Say a few words.
Just don't mention god.
Amanda's parents are atheists, lawyers, and major douches.
Bless me, father, for I have sinned.
It's been a while since my last confession.
Continue, my son.
"My son." I'm sorry.
It's just you're, like, a thousand years older than me.
Who are you and where's father Dugan?
Leaving on sabbatical.
Fun for him and fun for me.
This is my first week of confessions.
It is?
Yeah, and, man, the things I've heard.
There was a lady yesterday who...
No, no, no, I can't say it.
I think I'll come back.
Unh-unh.
No.
You're not going anywhere.
I told you to wait in the car.
Don't snap at me.
That's why we're here.
You keep saying you wanna talk to someone, so talk to this guy.
He seems perfectly... enthusiastic.
He's 12 years old.
This will blow his collar off.
Oh, man, this must be awesome.
I'm so bummed I can't tweet anymore.
Sorry.
If it's not father Dugan, I'm not doing this.
No...
let's go.
Nuts.
I was really hoping this would be a good one.
I made out with two chicks once in college.
This job rocks!
Uh...
I don't know if you've ever buried anything before, but you have to dig a hole.
Right.
Of course.
I knew that.
It's funny the way life works out sometimes, isn't it?
I mean, I wasn't even supposed to be here today.
Once again, in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Now I have to carry this around with me for the rest of my life.
Don't be sad, Mrs. Delfino.
Cupcake was kind of a bad hamster.
She had three babies and ate them.
But does that mean she deserved to die?
We don't get to make that call, Juanita.
We're not god.
That's right, Amanda.
I said it.
What have I done?
It's not your fault.
I know it's not my fault, but try telling that to Cupcake's family when they show up looking for her.
There.
We're done.
Now let's all slap on a happy face and pretend like this never happened.
Can I come in?
I'm really not feeling like drinking right now.
Great.
Mmm.
So... were you two close?
Pardon?
You and Cupcake.
Juanita told me what happened.
I assume you two had a long history, went to college together, backpacked through Europe.
It just sort of hit me in a weird way.
I'm worried about you.
First, you stop talking to your friends.
Now you're wigging out at a rat funeral.
You're making me nervous.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not handling accessory to murder as well as the rest of you.
Susan, I'm begging you.
This is my husband's life we're talking about.
If anything were to happen to him, think of what would happen to me and my girls.
I know you're having a hard time, but please hold it together.
I'm trying.
Try harder.
Bree?
Do I smell...
Yes, white chocolate macadamia nut...
your favorite.
Oh!
Now you're my favorite.
Mwah.
Hmm.
How was your day?
Terrific.
I found a dead body.
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.
You don't wanna hear about this.
No, I do.
Your work is fascinating.
So, um, where exactly did you find this body?
Warehouse out by the docks.
So now I'm a big hero because I cracked a case those poor bastards in New haven P.D.
have been working on for months.
Oh, good for you.
Mm.
I got lucky.
All I did was spot a sedan with Connecticut plates, and I asked myself, "Who owns that car?"
The dead man had a car.
Exactly.
The killers did everything right, but they forgot to get rid of the victim's ride.
What idiots.
Mm-hmm.
So you kept his keys, but it never occurred to you he might have a car.
I just threw all his stuff in our safe.
I didn't spend a lot of time thinking about it.
There it is.
Drop it off in a bad part of town, and let social decay... take its course.
Oh, god, do you have to tidy up?
Get in.
If anybody catches us in this car, we're dead.
Oh, no, it's a stick.
I can't drive a stick.
Can you?
I did once in high school.
It's easy.
Just one extra pedal.
Oh.
It was easier when I was drunk.
What should I do?
Should I gun it?
Gun it?
You can't even drive it.
I thought that was you.
- Chuck.
Look, Gaby, it's Chuck.
- Mm.
I-I saw you were struggling.
Whose car is this?
- My aunt's.
- My friend's.
Her aunt and my friend.
Aunt Shirley.
She, uh, came over to my place last night for book club, and...
She had too much to drink.
Classic Shirley.
So we told her we'd bring her car back today.
- In fact, she's waiting for us, so we should scoot.
- Yeah.
No way.
- I'll drive.
- What?
The way you guys are going, you're gonna kill someone.
Go, Bob.
I'll meet you back at the station.
Oh, no, Bob, Bob, don't go!
Bob?
Oh.
Well...
Okay, a road trip in this neat old car with your cop boyfriend.
Fun.
So where does Shirley live?
Yeah, Bree, where does she live?
Why are you asking me?
She's your aunt.
Just keep driving.
I'll tell you when to turn.
Huh.
That's interesting.
No, it's not.
I mean... what is?
Oklahoma city redhawks.
Is your aunt a fan?
Oh, yeah, Shirley loves that... uh... sport.
And... men's cologne?
She's a lesbian.
Yeah.
She could've been married, but, no, she's a lesbian.
So, this, um, aunt or... friend, who's a men's cologne-wearing lesbian... she also likes to chew tobacco?
'Cause I never met a woman who likes to chew... ever.
I chew tobacco.
And I'm a woman.
Yeah.
Mmm.
All that's missing is a glass of chardonnay.
I keep telling her to quit.
"Do you want mouth cancer?" I say, but she won't listen.
You okay?
Yeah.
Ugh!
No.
Pull over.
Now.
Sorry!
Shirley likes plain.
I prefer chocolate.
Oh!
Get out.
What?
I'm taking your car.
Oh, my god.
I could kiss you!
What?
What are you...
Just get out!
Shh!
Keep your voice down.
That man over there is a cop.
A cop?
No!
Get back in here.
When you start something, young man, you see it through.
Buckle up!
Hey, what happened?
Shirley.
Just happened to be walking by.
Isn't that a stroke of luck?
So do you think your friend Bob could give us a ride home?
Sure.
I'll...
I'll call him.
So how's that dating a cop while covering up a murder working out for you?
Hey, Renee.
Ladies.
Don't distract them.
They have an important job to do.
I'm gonna go see the new neighbor.
You know, give him a ride on the ol' welcome wagon.
Wow, that was fast.
- I didn't know you two had even talked.
- We haven't.
So what makes you think he's gonna be interested?
Hear that, ladies?
Watch and learn.
I will show you some of my secrets.
Hi.
I'm gonna save us some time.
Look, I'm single.
You're single.
I'm hot.
You're hot.
Assuming you're not gay, and those shoes tell me you're not, we could do that thing where we flirt for a few weeks.
You can stare at my ass getting the mail, and I do get my mail four times a day.
Or you... could invite me in for... coffee...
Right now.
Thanks for the offer, but, uh, I'm good.
Um, when I said "coffee,"
you did know I meant sex, right?
Oh, you were subtle, but, uh, yeah.
I got it.
Wow.
You should write a book.
Otherwise, when you die, your secrets will die with you.
Father Dugan!
I'm so glad I caught you.
I don't know if you remember me.
Gabrielle Solis.
I assume you've come to apologize for taking a phone call during my easter sermon?
Oh!
I'm sorry, father.
But, you know, if you don't confirm those spa appointments, you lose 'em.
Yeah.
Um, anyway, I came here about Carlos.
He's in trouble, and he needs your help.
Well, I'd love to help Carlos.
He's a good man.
But I'm afraid you're too late.
What?
You were the one who kept blabbing in that sermon how it's never too late to confess your sins.
See?
I can listen and take calls.
It's true.
God waits until the heart is ready.
But the airlines are a little stricter, and I'm not going overseas in a middle seat.
So if you'll excuse me.
You getting on, too, miss?
Uh, yes, but I couldn't... manage my bag.
Be a dear and grab it for me?
Hey.
What are you doing?
Taking you to the airport... with one quick detour.
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Are you crazy?
I can't miss my plane.
Well, I'm sorry if I'm trying to get you to do god's work instead of going on your dream vacation to...
Rwanda, where I'll be digging wells... for lepers.
Well, your little friends are gonna have to wait.
- Excuse me.
- Whoa.
Well, where did you u me from?
We're headed off on our honeymoon.
And we can't have any detours.
They say you have to get to the airport three hours early for international flights.
Oh, honey, relax.
Since we caught Bin Laden, you can stroll on the plane anytime you want.
It's just, I've done something, father,
And I'm afraid that it's... unforgivable.
God can forgive us for anything.
Really?
Anything?
Yes.
If we're willing to show that we are truly repentant.
How?
Well, it's not by what we say.
It's by what we do.
For instance, if we were talking about a crime... then confessing to the authorities would prove the intentions of our heart.
That... is not an option.
There are other people involved...
innocent people.
You can't ask to be absolved for a sin that you intend to keep hidden.
You should go.
You're gonna miss your flight.
I don't wanna leave you, Carlos, not till I'm sure that you're gonna be okay.
Father Dugan, I don't see any way that I am ever going to be okay.
Hey.
Hey.
I wish I could make you stop thinking about this.
Yeah, me, too.
I don't even know what I was looking for.
There is no absolution for this thing.
I just have to live with it.
Every noise I'd hear at night, it was him.
Every dark alley I passed, he was waiting for me.
When I'd lie in bed,
I was afraid he'd come find me.
He was in my dreams... and in my nightmares.
I couldn't escape him.
And that's what I had to live with... until now.
For the first time, I'm not scared.
You did that for me.
Yeah... by taking a man's life.
Yes, you may have taken a life, but you also saved one.
So if it's absolution you're looking for...
I give it to you.
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, is everything okay with the kids?
Yeah, yeah, the...
the kids are fine.
I just...
What?
Did something happen?
I really... need you right now.
Okay.
Morning.
Morning.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Crap, crap, crap.
- Come on.
Come on.
- Okay.
- Watch out for the, uh...
- Okay, okay, o...
- Honey.
Ooh.
- No, I'm okay.
Okay, go.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
They're still asleep.
Thank god.
I'll start the coffee.
Okay, you read my mind.
- Hey.
- Yeah?
So last night...
Yeah.
We should talk about it.
Uh-huh.
I mean...
If you wanna get back together...
I'm open to that.
But we have some serious problems that are gonna require serious work.
Oh, god.
Last night... uh... was... not about getting back together.
Then what the hell was it about?
I...
I had a nightmare.
Well... a-a nightmare?
Are you kidding me?
You've gotta understand.
I'm having a lot of nightmares.
This is such a scary time, and I really need you.
That's-that's why I didn't want to tell the kids.
Having you across the street makes me feel safe.
You're unbelievable.
You know what you do when you're scared, Lynette?
You buy a night-light.
You don't go have sex with the guy you are supposed to be separated from!
I want french toast.
- I hate french toast.
I want pancakes.
- Oh.
Kids... there's something your mom and I need to tell you.
Yeah.
Why don't we sit down?
Hey, I, uh, I know it's a barbecue, but isn't that a little casual?
Yeah, um,
I don't think I'm gonna go this year.
Why don't you go without me?
Hey, do I need to be worried?
I told you.
I'm fine.
I don't mean worried about you.
I mean worried about us.
I thought this was some problem between you and your friends, but... the way you've been shutting me out,
I'm starting to think you've got a problem with me.
How could you say that?
No matter what I'm going through,
I would never let anything come between us.
Yeah, I'm sure Tom and Lynette felt the same way.
Look where they ended up.
Well, I'm headed over there without you.
No.
I'm going with you.
You're right.
I do have a problem with the girls.
It's about time I went over there and straightened it out.
No!
No way.
You are not bringing Mike in on this.
He's not gonna tell anyone.
We can trust him.
Oh, just like I could trust you when we agreed to keep this between us?
Susan, we all empathize with your position, but I don't think it's smart to tell Mike.
Well, he knows something is up.
It's affecting our marriage.
You know what's gonna affect my marriage?
when my husband goes to prison.
I think we should let her tell him.
I can't believe this.
We all made a pact that night.
I don't remember anybody bringing up
These extra conditions.
Well, you weren't exactly asking anyone's opinion that night, were you, Bree?
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you elected yourself chairman of the... dead guy committee and started making decisions for everyone.
Like you always do.
Well, somebody had to, Susan,
And it sure as hell wasn't gonna be you.
I'm done talking about this.
The only reason I came to this barbecue was to let you know that I am telling Mike.
The hell you are.
Aah!
Oh, my god!
Gaby!
Gaby!
- Trade Manning?
- What, are you out of your mind?
Think for a minute.
When is his stock ever gonna be higher?
Let me go!
You could get a great player.
Yeah, maybe a great quarterback, like, I don't know.
Manning?
- Ow!
- Get off me!
Girls, people can hear us!
Ow!
I told you we couldn't trust her!
I can't see.
Lynette!
Aah!
Oh!
I got it!
What the hell's going on?
Uh, well...
I...
lost my earring, and the girls here were kind enough to help me look for it.
Oh!
There it is!
I went food shopping yesterday.
I kept having to put things back.
I'd take a couple of cans of peaches.
And then I'd remember that Tom was the only one who liked them, put them back.
Sweet pickles...
Tom.
Put them back.
I am so sorry.
With everything that's been going on,
I haven't been there for you.
I guess we've all been guilty of that.
I'm sorry, Susan.
This is so damn hard.
You know, the good thing about Mike and Tom not knowing is they can't be implicated.
If something were to happen, at least they'd be okay.
We are never gonna be able to tell anybody about this, are we?
No.
Are you gonna be able to live with that?
I'm gonna try.
It's only the best of friends who stay long after the party's over to help clean up...
To cleanse the pain of a guilty conscience... to pick up the pieces... of a broken marriage...
To sweep away the loneliness of keeping a secret.
Yes...
It's good to have friends who help clean up our messes.
But every housewife knows that as soon as one mess is taken care of... another one appears.
And we may find ourselves... right back where we started.
A lot can happen when a visitor comes to town.
Whether it's a relative, an old friend, the pope, or as hard to believe as it might be, in her case, a new boyfriend.
- Larry.
- Hi.
Do you wanna go see a movie this weekend?
Before you answer, just know that the only reason I asked you is so that you would say "sure,"
and then I could say, "sorry, I can't,
"'cause my policeman boyfriend is coming to town,
"so I'm gonna be with him."
Nah, I don't feel like going to a movie.
So, what are you and Dennis gonna do?
I don't know.
I'm trying to think of something fun to do.
I have an idea.
Why don't you guys go driving around handing out tickets to people who don't deserve them, because if I remember correctly, that's sort of your boyfriend's thing.
I thought you weren't wearing your seatbelt.
And I thought you were my friend.
Oh.
Oh, now... now we're supporting each other?
[Laughs]
I'm actually kind of nervous about seeing Dennis again.
Why?
You guys had so much fun last time.
Did we?
That was two weeks ago.
People change.
I'm just not sure he's right for me.
Don't do the checklist thing.
Just because a guy can speak a foreign language and reads a book a week does not mean he's dating material.
You wanna know who reads a book a week?
Inmates.
Don't knock the checklist, Kate.
It has steered me away from many a loser.
What about that funny, handsome doctor?
- Who wore a pinky ring.
- Or the sexy artist?
- Who casually littered.
- What about Trevor?
Whose name was Trevor.
Sorry we took so long.
Larry did this whole elaborate dance where he pretended to look in his wallet for money.
I swear there's a 20 in here somewhere.
[Gasps] Oh, my God.
This is awesome.
I get to take care of my boss' dog pasta this weekend.
Samantha usually does it, but she broke both her legs.
Which I feel terrible about.
I don't know, Kate.
I don't know if that's such a good idea, Kate.
You're not...
Yes, I am.
- Mm...
- She thinks I'm not good with animals.
I grew up on a farm.
Where the animals would literally run away from you.
Her dad eventually had to reinforce the fence to keep the cows in.
He told me that was just to make them feel safe.
You know what?
I'm over all of that anyway.
And lately I've really been wanting a pet.
I think looking after this dog would be great practice and a chance to impress my boss.
Maybe you should practice on a pet whose owner can't fire you.
You know what?
Don't worry.
I'll help.
When I was a kid, I had three dogs, and they all loved me.
Well, two of them loved me, and one of them was, well, not all there.
We can take care of your boss' dog together.
It'll be fun.
[Barks]
[Barks]
See, this is fun, right?
♪♪ Our love is volatile, chemical ♪♪
♪♪ anything but typical ♪♪
♪♪ I want you badly ♪♪
♪♪ love you madly ♪♪
♪♪ I love you madly ♪♪
[Dog barking]
Okay, don't worry.
I can handle this.
[Dog growls]
It reminds me of...
of our third dog switchback.
He would chew through everything.
You know what?
I'll bribe him.
I'm not above that.
Here you go.
[Barks] [Screams]
Oh!
Ah!
You know what?
That was probably just a love nip.
Some dogs do that...
that's how they show affection.
[Barks] Ow!
Ah!
[Barks]
That thing is a monster.
[Upbeat music]
So, I guess the better question is, what's the appropriate time not to use your siren?
[Laughs] You're funny, Dennis.
Do you know a foreign language?
I don't barely well know English that good.
That's a joke, Connie.
Oh.
[Laughs]
Okay, good.
But so that's "no" then?
On the language question, that's a...
[Clicks tongue] No.
- That's a "no."
- Okay.
Hey, do you own any jean shorts?
Not enough.
I mean, what other shorts can you wear with cowboy boots?
Come on, Connie.
I know what you're doing.
We all have checklists, but some of us are a little more subtle about it.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, I don't mind.
I'm just curious how I'm scoring.
Well, you started out slow, but you're picking up.
That's too bad, 'cause you're not doing so great.
You already missed three on mine.
I'm not gonna say which ones, but you might wanna rethink your stance on popcorn shrimp.
[Laughs] Never.
- Hmm.
- Hmm.
Has own checklist.
Check.
[Upbeat music]
Hey!
How was your date?
Well, he missed a lot of things on the checklist.
- [Scoffs]
- But I liked him anyway.
- Yay!
- What's that sound?
[Scratching and barking]
The washer and dryer.
Oh, the horrible scratching sound?
- Yes, that one.
- That's the dog.
I put him in the bathroom.
- Kate, I told you...
- No, things are going so great between us.
He really loves me.
Plus, I think he really likes it in the bathroom.
I don't think he does.
[Upbeat music]
All right, I should get back.
Kate's alone with the dog.
What are you doing with your Saturday?
I'm working on Saturdays, Ben.
For me, the law never sleeps.
I'm a warrior for justice.
Wow.
You haven't worked on a Saturday since, um...
Nope, you've never worked on a Saturday.
Ben, there's been a miscarriage of justice here.
Okay?
Connie's boyfriend...
God, those words do not wanna be next to each other.
Anyway, that guy gave me a ticket which I did not deserve, so I am going to convince him of his folly.
Now, how am I gonna do that, you may ask?
I was not going to ask that.
- My first thought was that I might go big-city lawyer all over his county-bumpkin ass.
So, you see, I, the appellant, will be arguing pro se and pro tem that there is a clear conflict of interest on your part, seeing as you are dating the only other witness to this so-called crime.
I'll see you in court, officer.
Well, sir,
I see you have the facts on your side.
You are clearly the better man, both in looks and sexual ability.
Please accept the key to our city.
[Cheers, applause]
Yeah.
Why don't you do that?
Well, to be honest, those keys look cool, but they don't actually open anything, so...
Secondly, I think he might see that one coming.
So, no, no, no.
I've devised the most brilliant, the most diabolical, most unexpected plan ever.
You're gonna become friends with him.
How did you know that?
That's always your plan, Larry.
You become friends with guys to get something from them and then you forget you want that thing, and you end up just being friends.
And, no, you still can't have my sister's phone number.
Oh, my gosh.
I almost forgot about her.
She is way better looking than you are.
[Upbeat music]
I shot a kid.
He was 13 years old.
It was dark.
I couldn't see him.
He had a ray gun.
It looked real enough.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe that's your favorite line from die hard.
As a police officer, it really moved me.
I'm gonna go powder my nose.
Why do people say that?
It's so much weirder than what I'm actually gonna do...
Which is just pee, I'm just peeing.
Hey.
Hey.
You're Dennis, right?
Connie's friend.
- Yeah, and you're, um...
- Larry.
Larry munsch.
No, I remember you.
You're still not wearing your seatbelt.
Although I guess if you were,
I'd have to give you a ticket for being too crazy.
Well, I was...
I was actually gonna meet somebody here.
Do you mind if I join you?
- Well, I'm actually...
- I'll just... oh.
Uh, is that watch you're wearing the '93 z from the June 2009 issue of Skymall?
The one that can translate into four languages and do calculus?
- Yeah, actually it is.
- Oh, my God!
I have the exact same watch.
Well, I thought I was the only one who read Skymall that thoroughly.
Uh, it's only my favorite place to get gifts for people.
My favorite gift is to get people a subscription to Skymall.
[Upbeat music]
[Gasps]
What are you doing here?
Oh, hey, Connie.
Larry's waiting to meet someone and wanted to join us.
And in the meantime, I think it's safe to say that we're, uh, we're becoming friends.
Well, I don't know about that, but we do have the same watch.
And that's not all we have in common.
We've been sitting here for, what, five minutes, and we can already name two things we know we both like.
Two things from the Skymall catalog.
We both like robotic dogs.
That doesn't count.
Everybody likes robotic dogs.
- That's not true.
- No.
Larry, why are you really here?
Even you must sense how inappropriate this is.
There is nothing inappropriate about a manly friendship.
In fact, I think it's kind of beautiful.
Dennis, are you free tomorrow?
No.
Dennis and I are hanging out.
He's in town to see me.
Sorry, Larry.
I'll have to take a raincheck.
But I'll probably be back in town next month.
No, I was hoping to hang out with you a lot sooner than that.
That's... it's okay.
We'll figure it out.
- There's nothing to figure out.
- Yeah, we'll figure it out.
[Upbeat music]
I'm not crazy.
I mean, I know things aren't going great with pasta, but maybe it's not me.
Maybe it's the dog.
I mean, maybe pasta just really doesn't like anyone.
Oh, I don't...
I don't think he really likes me.
Maybe he's getting used to us.
Yeah.
[Dog growls]
- What's that noise?
- That noise...
[Dog growls]
Oh, he's purring.
[Continues growling]
- He likes you.
- Oh, okay.
[Growling]
So, it is me.
I'm the problem.
You know what?
You just need to bond with him.
Tomorrow is Sunday.
Why don't you two do something fun together?
Just the two of you.
You can go for a walk or anything.
Sky is the limit!
But probably a walk, right?
I mean, he is a dog.
Okay.
Ben is right.
Look at us learning to love each other.
It's exactly what we needed, some one-on-one time.
I wish those cows could see me now.
You wanna go this way?
Great.
Great.
Oh!
[Dog barks]
Pasta.
Pasta!
Pasta!
- Did you find him?
- No.
I thought I saw him at one point, but then I lost sight of him, so I just followed the sound of his leash dragging.
But then after four blocks,
I came around the corner and I realized
I'd been chasing a woman with a rolling suitcase, who was terrified, needless to say.
Ah, it's gonna be fine.
Right, it's gonna be fine.
Worst case scenario I lose my job, have to move out of here because I can no longer afford my half of the rent, move back to the farm where every day I see those cow eyes judging me.
I see that you're spinning out, and I would love to help you but I can't, because I am meeting Dennis for lunch, and I have to go, because we're under attack from Larry.
- Is he being mean to Dennis?
- I wish.
He's trying to be friends with him.
That does sound like you're under attack.
He's up to something.
I just can't figure out what it is.
You know what it sounds like to me?
- Hmm?
- It sounds like you're jealous of Larry and Dennis.
Yeah, I'm jealous, Kate.
Oh, my God, that's it!
Larry's jealous of me and Dennis.
You're a genius.
[Phone rings]
Ben, did you find him?
No.
No sign of him here either.
Okay, look, don't...
don't worry.
We put posters up everywhere.
We'll... we'll find him.
You know, I don't know what I feel worse about... the fact that pasta's probably getting inducted into some sort of horrible dog gang, or that...
I might lose my job because of it, or... and, here's the cherry on top...
I have definitely proven that I'm incapable of taking care of another living thing.
Uh, well, look, I'm...
I'm sure he's gonna turn up.
Okay?
We're heading back out there right now.
Oh, we're not going anywhere until I finish eating my breakfast, okay?
Okay, I'll call you in a bit.
Bye.
- What'd she say?
- Well, she's worried this is a sign that she'll never be able to take care of anything.
- She said that?
- Yeah.
She said those words?
Dude, she's obviously talking about...
Both:
Babies.
Exactly.
So, you... you know what you got to do, right?
Run away.
Find that dog.
What?
What is happening here?
I want to have kids with her, Larry.
Ow!
Geez.
Can we please agree to stop doing that?
Uh, let me think about it.
No.
Oh, gee.
Okay, you know what?
Look, I'm not talking about having kids now.
- Okay.
- All right?
But eventually.
Someday.
And I don't want her to think she's gonna be a bad mom.
As my mom always used to say, Ben, there is no such thing as a good mom.
Anyway, I've gotta help her find this dog, okay?
But it could literally be anywhere in Manhattan.
I mean, to do this right.
I...
I'd need the entire police force.
Stop.
Stop right there.
This sounds like the perfect opportunity to pay a little visit to my new best friend.
[Upbeat music]
I don't like wearing turtlenecks either.
It feels like I'm being strangled by someone wearing very soft gloves.
Isn't it nice not having Larry here?
Well, I hadn't thought about it, but sure.
I mean, this whole thing with him trying to be friends with you...
He's up to something.
Do you think he's trying to get in on my massive inheritance?
You have a massive inheritance?
If the beanie baby market remains stable,
I am gonna be just fine.
[Chuckles] I don't know why
I'm even talking about Larry.
He isn't even here.
- Hello, Larry.
- Bonjour, Denny.
Unbelievable!
I told you he was up to something!
- I'm not up to anything, okay?
- Whatever.
Listen, Kate lost her dog, and we were thinking that you might know some cool police techniques to help find him.
I'm really sorry to interrupt your date.
I just...
I'm desperate.
It sounds like they could use my help, and I do know cool police techniques.
Larry, can I talk to you for a second?
- Oh, that's...
- Over here.
[Clears throat] Excuse me.
I know what you're doing here, Larry.
Yeah, so do I.
I'm asking a law enforcement officer, who also happens to be my new friend, to help me find Kate's dog.
- You don't care about that dog.
- Incorrect.
I care deeply about every living creature.
You know that.
It's my thing.
And you don't care about being friends with Dennis.
How can you say that?
We wear the same watch.
So, the only other possible reason for you coming here is because you are jealous.
- Oh, jealous.
Oh...
- Yeah, jealous.
Oh, hotdog.
I wish I had a mouth full of water so I could do a spit take right now.
We should really get a move on.
The first 48 hours is the most important in a search for a missing person.
If you do the math in dog years, we are running out of time.
Ben, Dennis, let's roll.
[Upbeat music]
Hey, can I have my sunglasses back?
Yeah, yeah, you bet.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, man, how awesome is this, huh?
Three buddies just hanging out.
We're not just hanging out.
We're on a job.
The important thing is to keep your eyes peeled, your head on a swivel, and mind your six.
Mind your six?
How awesome is that?
Larry, would you stop this, please.
We have to find this dog.
I'm looking.
Looking harder than anyone, okay, except for maybe my friend Dennis here.
Ooh, "my friend Dennis." I could get used to that.
- Just mind your six, Larry.
- Mind my six.
Got it.
What is my six?
He's not at the 18th street shelter either.
Do you have any other thoughts?
Yeah, that Larry is unbelievable.
I mean, does he really think
I would ever like him like that?
The thought is sickening.
This whole love triangle thing is really important, Connie, but please can you focus?
What if we don't find him?
We'll find him.
Manhattan's not that big, and people here like to help.
Yeah, they're not gonna find him.
Boom.
Found him.
Oh, thank God!
I was gonna be in so much trouble.
And, more importantly, you're safe.
- Uh-huh.
- Where's Dennis?
We broke up into quadrants.
He'll be back soon.
Now, it should be said that even though
I'm the one that found the dog, it wouldn't be possible without the training that Dennis gave me.
He's not even here, Larry.
You want your pillow, pasta?
Here you go, little guy.
You know, maybe he's hungry.
Why don't you, uh, try giving him a treat?
[Whines quietly]
Looks like pasta's time on the streets really scared him straight.
He's like a whole new dog.
Boom.
Found him!
But he must've slipped out of his collar.
Wait, who's that?
Oh, no.
Now we have too many dogs.
But that can't be pasta.
You said he had brown ear tips.
Oh, my God.
He is good!
Are you sure this one's pasta?
[Growls]
That's him.
You realize you stole a dog, right?
It certainly does appear that way, yes.
[Upbeat music]
Thank you so much for helping with the dog.
I know Kate really appreciates it.
It was my pleasure.
Search parties are always fun.
And it was nice to find something that was still alive for a change.
Oh!
Oh, look, it's you guys!
Oh, so glad I ran into you.
Right on time.
Showing up and interrupting my date again.
What?
No, no.
I just...
I wanted to make sure that I was here to say good-bye to Dennis before he left.
I know what you're doing here, Larry.
Me too.
Isn't it obvious?
You're trying to get me to reverse your traffic ticket.
What?
Whoa!
Wow, Dennis, that hurts.
I haven't even been thinking about that ticket, all right?
But, you know, now that you mention it, do friends really give friends traffic tickets?
It feels like they should be a little more busy doing each other solids, and wearing cool watches, and stuff like that.
Robotic dogs.
Well, Larry, I wouldn't be a very good friend if I let you think that driving without a seatbelt didn't have consequences.
This is all about your stupid traffic ticket?
- Uh-uh.
Connie, there's no such thing as stupid tickets, only stupid idiots.
If you wanna fight your ticket in court,
I'll be happy to take you to dinner when you lose.
No, never mind.
I hate court.
Uh, well, I guess I should be taking off.
After 11:00, the amount of drunk drivers on the road doubles every hour.
By 3:00 A.M., it's pretty much bumper cars out there.
Okay.
Well, the next time you come down,
I am gonna make sure that Larry doesn't bother us.
Yeah.
I'm not sure I'm gonna be coming back down anytime soon, Connie.
Why?
Well, I wasn't surprised that Larry was trying to get out of his ticket, but what did surprise me was how disappointed you were that that was all he was doing.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What I'm saying is, is maybe the person you're really looking for isn't the person who would do well on your checklist.
Sometimes it takes a person you don't know very well to point out the obvious.
[Sneezes]
Whoo!
I guess people just have different skills.
Some people are good at nurturing, and I'm good at...
Remembering the names of every cab driver
I've ever had.
And sometimes a person who knows you best totally misses the point.
Kate, you have nothing to worry about.
Okay?
You are going to be a great mom.
What?
Do you know something that I don't know?
No, no.
I just... well, when you... when you talked about nurturing,
I...
I thought you must've meant...
Nurturing babies.
No, I didn't.
I just meant that I hate that I can never have a pet.
Oh.
Well...
That was a serious misread on my part.
Plus, no duh, I'm gonna be an awesome mom.
Have you met me?
[Laughs]
But I'm very glad you think so too.
[Chuckles] Hey.
Yo.
So, uh, we just saw Dennis leave.
Mm-hmm.
Take care of that ticket or what?
No.
No, no, no.
But, uh, I think we're even.
You stole his sunglasses?
No, he left them on the table, thank you very much.
Finders keepers.
Benjamin, Benjamin, head on a swivel.
Any ladies on my six?
A lot can happen when a visitor comes to town, whether it's a relative, an old friend, the Pope, or as hard to believe as it might be, in her case, a new boyfriend.
- Larry.
- Hi.
Do you wanna go see a movie this weekend?
Before you answer, just know that the only reason I asked you is so that you would say "Sure," and then I could say, "Sorry, I can't,
"'cause my policeman boyfriend is coming to town, so I'm gonna be with him."
Nah, I don't feel like going to a movie.
So, what are you and Dennis gonna do?
- I'm trying to think of something fun to do.
- I have an idea.
Why don't you guys go driving around handing out tickets to people who don't deserve them, because if I remember correctly, that's sort of your boyfriend's thing.
I thought you weren't wearing your seatbelt.
And I thought you were my friend.
Oh.
Oh, now...
Now we're supporting each other?
I'm actually kind of nervous about seeing Dennis again.
Why?
You guys had so much fun last time.
Did we?
That was two weeks ago.
People change.
I'm just not sure he's right for me.
Don't do the checklist thing.
Just because a guy can speak a foreign language and reads a book a week does not mean he's dating material.
You wanna know who reads a book a week?
Inmates.
Don't knock the checklist, Kate.
It has steered me away from many a loser.
What about that funny, handsome doctor?
- Who wore a pinky ring.
- Or the sexy artist?
- Who casually littered.
- What about Trevor?
Whose name was Trevor.
Sorry we took so long.
Larry did this whole elaborate dance where he pretended to look in his wallet for money.
I swear there's a 20 in here somewhere.
Oh, my God.
This is awesome.
I get to take care of my boss's dog Pasta this weekend.
Samantha usually does it, but she broke both her legs.
Which I feel terrible about.
I don't know if that's such a good idea, Kate.
- You're not...
- Yes, I am.
Mmm...
She thinks I'm not good with animals.
I grew up on a farm.
Where the animals would literally run away from you.
Her dad eventually had to reinforce the fence to keep the cows in.
He told me that was just to make them feel safe.
You know what?
I'm over all of that anyway.
And lately I've really been wanting a pet.
I think looking after this dog would be great practice and a chance to impress my boss.
Maybe you should practice on a pet whose owner can't fire you.
You know what?
Don't worry.
I'll help.
When I was a kid,
I had three dogs, and they all loved me.
Well, two of them loved me, and one of them was, well, not all there.
We can take care of your boss's dog together.
It'll be fun.
See, this is fun, right?
# Our love is volatile, chemical #
# Anything but typical #
# I want you badly #
# I love you madly #
Okay, don't worry.
I can handle this.
It reminds me of...
of our third dog Switchback.
He would chew through everything.
You know what?
I'll bribe him.
I'm not above that.
Here, Pasta.
Oh!
Ah!
You know what?
That was probably just a love nip.
Some dogs do that.
That's how they show affection.
Ow!
Ah!
That thing is a monster.
So, I guess the better question is, what's the appropriate time not to use your siren?
You're funny, Dennis.
Do you know a foreign language?
I don't barely well know English that good.
That's a joke, Connie.
Oh, okay.
Good.
But so that's "no" then?
On the language question, that's a...
No.
- That's a "no."
- Okay.
Hey, do you own any jean shorts?
Not enough.
I mean, what other shorts can you wear with cowboy boots?
Come on, Connie.
I know what you're doing.
We all have checklists, but some of us are a little more subtle about it.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, I don't mind.
I'm just curious how I'm scoring.
Well, you started out slow, but you're picking up.
That's too bad, 'cause you're not doing so great.
You already missed three on mine.
I'm not gonna say which ones, but you might wanna rethink your stance on popcorn shrimp.
Never.
- Hmm.
- Hmm.
Has own checklist.
Check.
Hey!
How was your date?
Well, he missed a lot of things on the checklist.
But I liked him anyway.
- Yay!
- What's that sound?
The washer and dryer?
Oh, the horrible scratching sound?
- Yes, that one.
- That's the dog.
I put him in the bathroom.
Kate, I told you...
No, things are going so great between us.
He really loves me.
Plus, I think he really likes it in the bathroom.
I don't think he does.
All right, I should get back.
Kate's alone with the dog.
What are you doing with your Saturday?
I'm work on Saturdays, Ben.
For me, the law never sleeps.
I'm a warrior for justice.
Wow.
You haven't worked on a Saturday since, um...
Nope, you've never worked on a Saturday.
Ben, there's been a miscarriage of justice here.
Okay?
Connie's boyfriend...
God, those words do not wanna be next to each other.
Anyway, that guy gave me a ticket which I did not deserve, so I am going to convince him of his folly.
Now, how am I gonna do that, you may ask?
I was not going to ask that.
My first thought was that I might go big-city lawyer all over his county-bumpkin ass.
So, you see, I, the appellant, will be arguing pro se and pro tem that there is a clear conflict of interest on your part, seeing as you are dating the only other witness to this so-called crime.
I'll see you in court, Officer.
Well, sir,
I see you have the facts on your side.
You are clearly the better man, both in looks and sexual ability.
Please accept the key to our city.
Yeah.
Why don't you do that?
Well, to be honest, those keys look cool, but they don't actually open anything, so...
Secondly, I think he might see that one coming.
So, no, no, no.
I've devised the most brilliant, the most diabolical, most unexpected plan ever.
You're gonna become friends with him.
How did you know that?
That's always your plan, Larry.
You become friends with guys to get something from them and then you forget you want that thing, and you end up just being friends.
And, no, you still can't have my sister's phone number.
Oh, my gosh.
I almost forgot about her.
She is way better looking than you are.
I shot a kid.
He was 13 years old.
It was dark.
I couldn't see him.
He had a ray gun.
It looked real enough.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe that's your favorite line from Die Hard.
As a police officer, it really moved me.
I'm gonna go powder my nose.
Why do people say that?
It's so much weirder than what I'm actually gonna do.
Which is just pee, I'm just peeing.
Hey.
Hey.
You're Dennis, right?
Connie's friend.
- Yeah, and you're, um...
- Larry.
Larry Munsch.
No, I remember you.
You're still not wearing your seatbelt.
Although I guess if you were,
I'd have to give you a ticket for being too crazy.
Well, I was actually gonna meet somebody here.
Do you mind if I join you?
- Well, I'm actually...
- I'll just...
Oh.
Uh, is that watch you're wearing the '93 Z from the June 2009 issue of SkyMall?
The one that can translate into four languages and do calculus?
- Yeah, actually it is.
- Oh, my God!
I have the exact same watch.
Well, I thought I was the only one who read SkyMall that thoroughly.
Uh, it's only my favorite place to get gifts for people.
My favorite gift is to get people a subscription to SkyMall.
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, hey, Connie.
Larry's waiting to meet someone and wanted to join us.
And in the meantime, I think it's safe to say that we're, uh...
we're becoming friends.
Well, I don't know about that, but we do have the same watch.
And that's not all we have in common.
We've been sitting here for, what, five minutes, and we can already name two things we know we both like.
Two things from the SkyMall catalog.
We both like robotic dogs.
That doesn't count.
Everybody likes robotic dogs.
- That's not true.
- No.
Larry, why are you really here?
Even you must sense how inappropriate this is.
There is nothing inappropriate about a manly friendship.
In fact, I think it's kind of beautiful.
Dennis, are you free tomorrow?
No.
Dennis and I are hanging out.
He's in town to see me.
Sorry, Larry.
I'll have to take a rain check.
But I'll probably be back in town next month.
No, I was hoping to hang out with you a lot sooner than that.
That's...
It's okay.
We'll figure it out.
- There's nothing to figure out.
- Yeah, we'll figure it out.
I'm not crazy.
I mean, I know things aren't going great with Pasta, but maybe it's not me.
Maybe it's the dog.
I mean, maybe pasta just really doesn't like anyone.
Oh, I don't...
I don't think he really likes me.
Maybe he's getting used to us.
Yeah.
- What's that noise?
- That noise...
Oh, he's purring.
- He likes you.
- Oh, okay.
So, it is me.
I'm the problem.
You know what?
You just need to bond with him.
Tomorrow is Sunday.
Why don't you two do something fun together?
Just the two of you.
You can go for a walk or anything.
Sky is the limit!
But probably a walk, right?
I mean, he is a dog.
Okay.
Ben was right.
Look at us learning to love each other.
It's exactly what we needed...
some one-on-one time.
I wish those cows could see me now.
You wanna go this way?
Right?
Oh!
Pasta, wait!
Pasta!
Pasta!
- Did you find him?
- No.
I thought I saw him at one point, but then I lost sight of him, so I just followed the sound of his leash dragging.
But then after four blocks,
I came around the corner and I realized
I'd been chasing a woman with a rolling suitcase, who was terrified, needless to say.
Ah, it's gonna be fine.
Right, it's gonna be fine.
Worst case scenario I lose my job, have to move out of here because I can no longer afford my half of the rent, move back to the farm where every day I see those cow eyes judging me.
I see that you're spinning out, and I would love to help you but I can't, because I am meeting Dennis for lunch, and I have to go, because we're under attack from Larry.
- Is he being mean to Dennis?
- I wish.
He's trying to be friends with him.
That does sound like you're under attack.
He's up to something.
I just can't figure out what it is.
You know what it sounds like to me?
- Hmm?
- It sounds like you're jealous of Larry and Dennis.
Yeah, I'm jealous, Kate.
Oh, my God, that's it!
Larry's jealous of me and Dennis.
You're a genius.
Ben, did you find him?
No.
No sign of him here either.
Okay, look, don't worry.
We put posters up everywhere.
We'll find him.
You know, I don't know what I feel worse about... the fact that Pasta's probably getting inducted into some sort of horrible dog gang, or that I might lose my job because of it, or... and here's the cherry on top...
I have definitely proven that I'm incapable of taking care of another living thing.
Well, look, I'm sure he's gonna turn up.
Okay?
We're heading back out there right now.
Oh, we're not going anywhere until I finish eating my breakfast, okay?
Okay, I'll call you in a bit.
Bye.
- What'd she say?
- Well, she's worried this is a sign that she'll never be able to take care of anything.
- She said that?
- Yeah.
She said those words?
Dude, she's obviously talking about... babies.
Exactly.
So you know what you got to do, right?
- Run away.
- Find that dog.
What?
What is happening here?
I want to have kids with her, Larry.
Ow!
Jeez.
Can we please agree to stop doing that?
Uh, let me think about it.
No.
Okay, you know what?
Look, I'm not talking about having kids now.
- Okay.
- All right?
But eventually.
Someday.
And I don't want her to think she's gonna be a bad mom.
As my mom always used to say, Ben, there is no such thing as a good mom.
Anyway, I've gotta help her find this dog, okay?
But it could literally be anywhere in Manhattan.
I mean, to do this right, I'd need the entire police force.
Stop.
Stop right there.
This sounds like the perfect opportunity to pay a little visit to my new best friend.
I don't like wearing turtlenecks either.
It feels like I'm being strangled by someone wearing very soft gloves.
Isn't it nice not having Larry here?
Well, I hadn't thought about it, but sure.
I mean, this whole thing with him trying to be friends with you...
He's up to something.
Do you think he's trying to get in on my massive inheritance?
You have a massive inheritance?
If the Beanie Baby market remains stable,
I am gonna be just fine.
I don't know why I'm even talking about Larry.
He isn't even here.
- Hello, Larry.
- Bonjour, Denny.
Unbelievable!
I told you he was up to something!
- I'm not up to anything, okay?
- Whatever.
Listen, Kate lost her dog, and we were thinking that you might know some cool police techniques to help find him.
I'm really sorry to interrupt your date.
I just...
I'm desperate.
It sounds like they could use my help, and I do know cool police techniques.
Larry, can I talk to you for a second?
- Oh, that's...
- Over here.
Excuse me.
I know what you're doing here, Larry.
Yeah, so do I.
I'm asking a law enforcement officer, who also happens to be my new friend, to help me find Kate's dog.
- You don't care about that dog.
- Incorrect.
I care deeply about every living creature.
You know that.
It's my thing.
And you don't care about being friends with Dennis.
How can you say that?
We wear the same watch.
So, the only other possible reason for you coming here is because you are jealous.
- Oh, jealous.
Oh...
- Yeah, jealous.
Oh, hotdog.
I wish I had a mouth full of water so I could do a spit take right now.
We should really get a move on.
The first 48 hours is the most important in a search for a missing person.

A lot can happen when a visitor comes to town.
Whether it's a relative, an old friend, the pope, or as hard to believe as it might be, in her case, a new boyfriend.
- Larry.
- Hi.
Do you wanna go see a movie this weekend?
Before you answer, just know that the only reason I asked you is so that you would say "sure,"
and then I could say, "sorry, I can't,
"'cause my policeman boyfriend is coming to town,

Larry did this whole elaborate dance where he pretended to look in his wallet for money.
I swear there's a 20 in here somewhere.
Oh, my God.
This is awesome.
I get to take care of my boss' dog pasta this weekend.
Samantha usually does it, but she broke both her legs.
Which I feel terrible about.
I don't know, Kate.
I don't know if that's such a good idea, Kate.
You're not...
Yes, I am.
- Mm...
- She thinks I'm not good with animals.
I grew up on a farm.
Where the animals would literally run away from you.
Her dad eventually had to reinforce the fence to keep the cows in.
He told me that was just to make them feel safe.
You know what?
I'm over all of that anyway.
And lately I've really been wanting a pet.
I think looking after this dog would be great practice and a chance to impress my boss.
Maybe you should practice on a pet whose owner can't fire you.
You know what?
Don't worry.
I'll help.
When I was a kid, I had three dogs, and they all loved me.
Well, two of them loved me, and one of them was, well, not all there.
We can take care of your boss' dog together.
It'll be fun.
See, this is fun, right?
♪♪ Our love is volatile, chemical ♪♪
♪♪ anything but typical ♪♪
♪♪ I want you badly ♪♪
♪♪ love you madly ♪♪
♪♪ I love you madly ♪♪
Okay, don't worry.
I can handle this.
It reminds me of...
of our third dog switchback.
He would chew through everything.
You know what?
I'll bribe him.
I'm not above that.
Here you go.
Oh!
Ah!
You know what?
That was probably just a love nip.
Some dogs do that...
that's how they show affection.
Ow!
Ah!
That thing is a monster.
So, I guess the better question is, what's the appropriate time not to use your siren?
You're funny, Dennis.
Do you know a foreign language?
I don't barely well know English that good.
That's a joke, Connie.
Oh.
Okay, good.
But so that's "no" then?
On the language question, that's a...
No.
- That's a "no."
- Okay.
Hey, do you own any jean shorts?
Not enough.
I mean, what other shorts can you wear with cowboy boots?
Come on, Connie.
I know what you're doing.
We all have checklists, but some of us are a little more subtle about it.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, I don't mind.
I'm just curious how I'm scoring.
Well, you started out slow, but you're picking up.
That's too bad, 'cause you're not doing so great.
You already missed three on mine.
I'm not gonna say which ones, but you might wanna rethink your stance on popcorn shrimp.
Never.
- Hmm.
- Hmm.
Has own checklist.
Check.
Hey!
How was your date?
Well, he missed a lot of things on the checklist.
But I liked him anyway.
- Yay!
- What's that sound?
The washer and dryer.
Oh, the horrible scratching sound?
- Yes, that one.
- That's the dog.
I put him in the bathroom.
- Kate, I told you...
- No, things are going so great between us.
He really loves me.
Plus, I think he really likes it in the bathroom.
I don't think he does.
All right, I should get back.
Kate's alone with the dog.
What are you doing with your Saturday?
I'm working on Saturdays, Ben.
For me, the law never sleeps.
I'm a warrior for justice.
Wow.
You haven't worked on a Saturday since, um...
Nope, you've never worked on a Saturday.
Ben, there's been a miscarriage of justice here.
Okay?
Connie's boyfriend...
God, those words do not wanna be next to each other.
Anyway, that guy gave me a ticket which I did not deserve, so I am going to convince him of his folly.
Now, how am I gonna do that, you may ask?
I was not going to ask that.
My first thought was that I might go big-city lawyer all over his county-bumpkin ass.
So, you see, I, the appellant, will be arguing pro se and pro tem that there is a clear conflict of interest on your part, seeing as you are dating the only other witness to this so-called crime.
I'll see you in court, officer.
Well, sir,
I see you have the facts on your side.
You are clearly the better man, both in looks and sexual ability.
Please accept the key to our city.
Yeah.
Why don't you do that?
Well, to be honest, those keys look cool, but they don't actually open anything, so...
Secondly, I think he might see that one coming.
So, no, no, no.
I've devised the most brilliant, the most diabolical, most unexpected plan ever.
You're gonna become friends with him.
How did you know that?
That's always your plan, Larry.
You become friends with guys to get something from them and then you forget you want that thing, and you end up just being friends.
And, no, you still can't have my sister's phone number.
Oh, my gosh.
I almost forgot about her.
She is way better looking than you are.
I shot a kid.
He was 13 years old.
It was dark.
I couldn't see him.
He had a ray gun.
It looked real enough.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe that's your favorite line from die hard.
As a police officer, it really moved me.
I'm gonna go powder my nose.
Why do people say that?
It's so much weirder than what I'm actually gonna do...
Which is just pee, I'm just peeing.
Hey.
Hey.
You're Dennis, right?
Connie's friend.
- Yeah, and you're, um...
- Larry.
Larry munsch.
No, I remember you.
You're still not wearing your seatbelt.
Although I guess if you were,
I'd have to give you a ticket for being too crazy.
Well, I was...
I was actually gonna meet somebody here.
Do you mind if I join you?
- Well, I'm actually...
- I'll just... oh.
Uh, is that watch you're wearing the '93 z from the June 2009 issue of Skymall?
The one that can translate into four languages and do calculus?
- Yeah, actually it is.
- Oh, my God!
I have the exact same watch.
Well, I thought I was the only one who read Skymall that thoroughly.
Uh, it's only my favorite place to get gifts for people.
My favorite gift is to get people a subscription to Skymall.
What are you doing here?
Oh, hey, Connie.
Larry's waiting to meet someone and wanted to join us.
And in the meantime, I think it's safe to say that we're, uh, we're becoming friends.
Well, I don't know about that, but we do have the same watch.
And that's not all we have in common.
We've been sitting here for, what, five minutes, and we can already name two things we know we both like.
Two things from the Skymall catalog.
We both like robotic dogs.
That doesn't count.
Everybody likes robotic dogs.
- That's not true.
- No.
Larry, why are you really here?
Even you must sense how inappropriate this is.
There is nothing inappropriate about a manly friendship.
In fact, I think it's kind of beautiful.
Dennis, are you free tomorrow?
No.
Dennis and I are hanging out.
He's in town to see me.
Sorry, Larry.
I'll have to take a raincheck.
But I'll probably be back in town next month.
No, I was hoping to hang out with you a lot sooner than that.
That's... it's okay.
We'll figure it out.
- There's nothing to figure out.
- Yeah, we'll figure it out.
I'm not crazy.
I mean, I know things aren't going great with pasta, but maybe it's not me.
Maybe it's the dog.
I mean, maybe pasta just really doesn't like anyone.
Oh, I don't...
I don't think he really likes me.
Maybe he's getting used to us.
Yeah.
- What's that noise?
- That noise...
Oh, he's purring.
- He likes you.
- Oh, okay.
So, it is me.
I'm the problem.
You know what?
You just need to bond with him.
Tomorrow is Sunday.
Why don't you two do something fun together?
Just the two of you.
You can go for a walk or anything.
Sky is the limit!
But probably a walk, right?
I mean, he is a dog.
Okay.
Ben is right.
Look at us learning to love each other.
It's exactly what we needed, some one-on-one time.
I wish those cows could see me now.
You wanna go this way?
Great.
Great.
Oh!
Pasta.
Pasta!
Pasta!
- Did you find him?
- No.
I thought I saw him at one point, but then I lost sight of him, so I just followed the sound of his leash dragging.
But then after four blocks,
I came around the corner and I realized
I'd been chasing a woman with a rolling suitcase, who was terrified, needless to say.
Ah, it's gonna be fine.
Right, it's gonna be fine.
Worst case scenario I lose my job, have to move out of here because I can no longer afford my half of the rent, move back to the farm where every day I see those cow eyes judging me.
I see that you're spinning out, and I would love to help you but I can't, because I am meeting Dennis for lunch, and I have to go, because we're under attack from Larry.
- Is he being mean to Dennis?
- I wish.
He's trying to be friends with him.
That does sound like you're under attack.
He's up to something.
I just can't figure out what it is.
You know what it sounds like to me?
- Hmm?
- It sounds like you're jealous of Larry and Dennis.
Yeah, I'm jealous, Kate.
Oh, my God, that's it!
Larry's jealous of me and Dennis.
You're a genius.
Ben, did you find him?
No.
No sign of him here either.
Okay, look, don't...
don't worry.
We put posters up everywhere.
We'll... we'll find him.
You know, I don't know what I feel worse about... the fact that pasta's probably getting inducted into some sort of horrible dog gang, or that...
I might lose my job because of it, or... and, here's the cherry on top...
I have definitely proven that I'm incapable of taking care of another living thing.
Uh, well, look, I'm...
I'm sure he's gonna turn up.
Okay?
We're heading back out there right now.
Oh, we're not going anywhere until I finish eating my breakfast, okay?
Okay, I'll call you in a bit.
Bye.
- What'd she say?
- Well, she's worried this is a sign that she'll never be able to take care of anything.
- She said that?
- Yeah.
She said those words?
Dude, she's obviously talking about...
Babies.
Exactly.
So, you... you know what you got to do, right?
Run away.
Find that dog.
What?
What is happening here?
I want to have kids with her, Larry.
Ow!
Geez.
Can we please agree to stop doing that?
Uh, let me think about it.
No.
Oh, gee.
Okay, you know what?
Look, I'm not talking about having kids now.
- Okay.
- All right?
But eventually.
Someday.
And I don't want her to think she's gonna be a bad mom.
As my mom always used to say, Ben, there is no such thing as a good mom.
Anyway, I've gotta help her find this dog, okay?
But it could literally be anywhere in Manhattan.
I mean, to do this right.
I...
I'd need the entire police force.
Stop.
Stop right there.
This sounds like the perfect opportunity to pay a little visit to my new best friend.
I don't like wearing turtlenecks either.
It feels like I'm being strangled by someone wearing very soft gloves.
Isn't it nice not having Larry here?
Well, I hadn't thought about it, but sure.
I mean, this whole thing with him trying to be friends with you...
He's up to something.
Do you think he's trying to get in on my massive inheritance?
You have a massive inheritance?
If the beanie baby market remains stable,
I am gonna be just fine.
I don't know why
I'm even talking about Larry.
He isn't even here.
- Hello, Larry.
- Bonjour, Denny.
Unbelievable!
I told you he was up to something!
- I'm not up to anything, okay?
- Whatever.
Listen, Kate lost her dog, and we were thinking that you might know some cool police techniques to help find him.
I'm really sorry to interrupt your date.
I just...
I'm desperate.
It sounds like they could use my help, and I do know cool police techniques.
Larry, can I talk to you for a second?
- Oh, that's...
- Over here.
Excuse me.
I know what you're doing here, Larry.
Yeah, so do I.
I'm asking a law enforcement officer, who also happens to be my new friend, to help me find Kate's dog.
- You don't care about that dog.
- Incorrect.
I care deeply about every living creature.
You know that.
It's my thing.
And you don't care about being friends with Dennis.
How can you say that?
We wear the same watch.
So, the only other possible reason for you coming here is because you are jealous.
- Oh, jealous.
Oh...
- Yeah, jealous.
Oh, hotdog.
I wish I had a mouth full of water so I could do a spit take right now.
We should really get a move on.
The first 48 hours is the most important in a search for a missing person.
If you do the math in dog years, we are running out of time.
Ben, Dennis, let's roll.
Hey, can I have my sunglasses back?
Yeah, yeah, you bet.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, man, how awesome is this, huh?
Three buddies just hanging out.
We're not just hanging out.
We're on a job.
The important thing is to keep your eyes peeled, your head on a swivel, and mind your six.
Mind your six?
How awesome is that?
Larry, would you stop this, please.
We have to find this dog.
I'm looking.
Looking harder than anyone, okay, except for maybe my friend Dennis here.
Ooh, "my friend Dennis." I could get used to that.
- Just mind your six, Larry.
- Mind my six.
Got it.
What is my six?
He's not at the 18th street shelter either.
Do you have any other thoughts?
Yeah, that Larry is unbelievable.
I mean, does he really think
I would ever like him like that?
The thought is sickening.
This whole love triangle thing is really important, Connie, but please can you focus?
What if we don't find him?
We'll find him.
Manhattan's not that big, and people here like to help.
Yeah, they're not gonna find him.
Boom.
Found him.
Oh, thank God!
I was gonna be in so much trouble.
And, more importantly, you're safe.
- Uh-huh.
- Where's Dennis?
We broke up into quadrants.
He'll be back soon.
Now, it should be said that even though
I'm the one that found the dog, it wouldn't be possible without the training that Dennis gave me.
He's not even here, Larry.
You want your pillow, pasta?
Here you go, little guy.
You know, maybe he's hungry.
Why don't you, uh, try giving him a treat?
Looks like pasta's time on the streets really scared him straight.
He's like a whole new dog.
Boom.
Found him!
But he must've slipped out of his collar.
Wait, who's that?
Oh, no.
Now we have too many dogs.
But that can't be pasta.
You said he had brown ear tips.
Oh, my God.
He is good!
Are you sure this one's pasta?
That's him.
You realize you stole a dog, right?
It certainly does appear that way, yes.
Thank you so much for helping with the dog.
I know Kate really appreciates it.
It was my pleasure.
Search parties are always fun.
And it was nice to find something that was still alive for a change.
Oh!
Oh, look, it's you guys!
Oh, so glad I ran into you.
Right on time.
Showing up and interrupting my date again.
What?
No, no.
I just...
I wanted to make sure that I was here to say good-bye to Dennis before he left.
I know what you're doing here, Larry.
Me too.
Isn't it obvious?
You're trying to get me to reverse your traffic ticket.
What?
Whoa!
Wow, Dennis, that hurts.
I haven't even been thinking about that ticket, all right?
But, you know, now that you mention it, do friends really give friends traffic tickets?
It feels like they should be a little more busy doing each other solids, and wearing cool watches, and stuff like that.
Robotic dogs.
Well, Larry, I wouldn't be a very good friend if I let you think that driving without a seatbelt didn't have consequences.
This is all about your stupid traffic ticket?
Uh-uh.
Connie, there's no such thing as stupid tickets, only stupid idiots.
If you wanna fight your ticket in court,
I'll be happy to take you to dinner when you lose.
No, never mind.
I hate court.
Uh, well, I guess I should be taking off.
After 11:00, the amount of drunk drivers on the road doubles every hour.
By 3:00 A.M., it's pretty much bumper cars out there.
Okay.
Well, the next time you come down,
I am gonna make sure that Larry doesn't bother us.
Yeah.
I'm not sure I'm gonna be coming back down anytime soon, Connie.
Why?
Well, I wasn't surprised that Larry was trying to get out of his ticket, but what did surprise me was how disappointed you were that that was all he was doing.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What I'm saying is, is maybe the person you're really looking for isn't the person who would do well on your checklist.
Sometimes it takes a person you don't know very well to point out the obvious.
Whoo!
I guess people just have different skills.
Some people are good at nurturing, and I'm good at...
Remembering the names of every cab driver
I've ever had.
And sometimes a person who knows you best totally misses the point.
Kate, you have nothing to worry about.
Okay?
You are going to be a great mom.
What?
Do you know something that I don't know?
No, no.
I just... well, when you... when you talked about nurturing,
I...
I thought you must've meant...
Nurturing babies.
No, I didn't.
I just meant that I hate that I can never have a pet.
Oh.
Well...
That was a serious misread on my part.
Plus, no duh, I'm gonna be an awesome mom.
Have you met me?
But I'm very glad you think so too.
Hey.
Yo.
So, uh, we just saw Dennis leave.
Mm-hmm.
Take care of that ticket or what?
No.
No, no, no.
But, uh, I think we're even.
You stole his sunglasses?
No, he left them on the table, thank you very much.
Finders keepers.
Benjamin, Benjamin, head on a swivel.
Any ladies on my six?
(doorbell ringing, knocking on door)
Does Tate Langdon live here?
He's my son.
Why?
What has he done?
All right, make entry.
(sirens wailing in distance)
Stop it.
Ah, okay.
(two gunshots)
(people screaming in distance)
(three gunshots)
(footsteps running)
What the hell, dude?
Somebody's shooting up the school.
He's shooting people.
Wait, are you hit?
Where are you hit?
Shit, I don't, I don't know, man.
That's not my blood.
I was right next to Mark Finstein, and the guy shot him in the freaking skull.
Who's doing this?
I-I don't know.
We need to get the hell out of here!
(two gunshots)
Go!
Go!
(footsteps walking slowly)
(door handle rattling)
(muffled whimpering)
(sniffles)
(footsteps slowly walking away)
(whispers):
Block the door!
Get the door!
(rapid gunshots)
(boy whistling tune)

(gunshot, body thuds)
(footsteps walking)
(whispers):
Hey.
No, no.
Please, no!
(gunshot)
(whimpers softly)
(footsteps walking)
(gunshot, thud)
Screw this.
It's going to be okay.
Ev-Everything is going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.
(shell clatters on floor)
Hey!
It's enough.
Get out of here.
(gunshot)
(sobs)
(pumps shotgun)
Oh, God!
(sirens approaching)
(sobbing)
Oh, God.
(sobbing)
Please!
(screams)
Why?

(sobs):
Why?
(pumps shotgun)
(sirens getting closer)
Please.
(gunshot)
(sirens wailing)
CONSTANCE:
Let me just talk to him!
Please, just let me talk to him!
Tate!
(sobbing):
Tate.
No, please.
He'll go peacefully.
He's just a child!
He's just a child!
Tate!
Tate!
Oh, God, please don't do this!
He's just a child!
Let me talk to him!
(whispers gunshot sound)
(panting)
Mom?
Mom?
Mommy.
She's not here.
Where is she?
Did you hurt her?
(chuckles)
Of course not.
She's probably at the grocery store, buying some frozen fare to reheat for your supper tonight.
You found out about Tate, didn't you?
I knew you would.
Get out of my house!
This is not happening.
I questioned my sanity when I first found out..
But this house... this house will make you a believer.
You see, Violet, we were living here when Tate lost his way.
And I believe that the house drove him to it.
What?
No.
That can't be real.
You're a smart girl.
How can you be so arrogant to think that there's only one reality that you're able to see?
I want you to meet someone.
Violet Harmon, meet Billie Dean Howard.
The child has no manners.
Billie is a gifted medium.
She can help.
You're confused.
Overwhelmed.
Why wouldn't you be?
I never asked for any of this.
None of us did.
But nothing can be done once one's been chosen.
Billie has been helping me for years.
I first found her on Craigslist.
I've been through all the phonies, but she is 100% authentic.
I've just come from a meeting at Lifetime;
they're interested in making a pilot with me.
A Craigslist psychic with a Hollywood agent.
Who'd have thought?
A medium, dear.
I can't read your future.
That's a different gift.
Have some chamomile tea.
It'll calm the nerves.
I'm in a dream.
I used to be like you.
Until I was 25.
When out of the blue, my cleaning lady shows up as I'm brushing my teeth.
Except she's got no toilet brush and rubber gloves, she's naked and bloody.
Her husband murdered her with an ice pick.
It's hard to keep good help.
BILLIE:
Do you think I wanted a bloody Mexican ghost in my bathroom?
All I wanted was to improve my tennis game and unseat Charlotte Whitney as president of my book club.
But I was chosen.
And when you're chosen, you either get with the program or you go crazy.
Understanding the truth is your only choice.
What's your version of the truth?
There are some who have an understandably violent and vengeful reaction to being horribly murdered.
They refuse to move on, until they exact their pound of flesh.
Then there are a very few souls, like Tate, who don't even know they're dead, who walk among the living in child-like confusion.
That's why I wanted him to see your father.
I was hoping your father might help him achieve some clarity about himself so that he could see the truth on his own.
We must help him cross over, Violet.
This is bullshit.
I was set up.
My computer was-- someone messed with my...
Who is Mary?
VIVIEN:
Violet, she wants to talk to you.
(monitor beeping steadily)
I don't understand you.
Never will understand you.
Does that mean anything to you?
"They don't understand you?"
(sobs)
(door opens, closes)
Can I trust her?
I'm not sure.
(Bach's "Cello Suite No. 5 in C Minor" playing)
(screams)
(ring clinks on table)
(beeps)
Okay, so I've checked the perimeter of the property, the upstairs, the basement.
Everything's secure.
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just hearing things.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
Oh, no, it's not a waste of time.
Not at all.
That's what I'm here for.
Even if it's only for your peace of mind.
Thank you.
My husband just moved out recently, so...
He had an affair, and don't know why I'm telling you this.
Oh, no.
It's okay.
Actually, we get sensitivity training.
We deal with people's worst fears, real or imaginary.
That makes sense.
But, actually, with the, uh, with the infidelity,
I have firsthand experience with that.
Hmm.
Not me.
No, my wife.
With another man?
It was a woman.
Yeah, I know.
A lot of guys would be into that, right?
Me, not so much.
(door opens)
What happened now?
I thought I heard somebody.
Where?
Outside or inside?
Outside.
I looked around, checked the alarm system.
Everything seems to be working fine.
Thanks for filling in.
Oh, by the way, the woman that I took out of here?
She never made it to the police station.
What?
I don't understand.
She must have hopped out of my vehicle at a stop sign or something.
Please keep you alarm on even when you're home.
Thank you.
(door opens, closes)
What are you doing here?
I've got to work, Vivien.
Rent an office.
We don't the have the money, Viv!
I promise I'll leave right after my last patient.
I don't want you here.
You brought this on yourself.
(sighs) You're right.
And you're angry.
If you violated our marriage right in front of me, I'd be furious.
But I need a place to work, Vivien.
We need the money.
I'm finding it really hard to look at your face.
'Cause I really, really, really want to bash it in.
I find you disgusting... and disappointing as a man.
And we're gonna end this marriage and we're gonna sell this house and I'll let you be a father to our kids because I happen to think that you're a good one.
But I'm not gonna be your friend.
I will merely tolerate you.
And you can see your patients in the house, but I want you to leave after your last session of the day.

Hold me down, force me to listen to 'em.
Older brothers can be mean.

Piggy Man?
I don't think I heard that one before.
Oh, God.
It's, uh, it's terrifying.
Okay, story goes, um... he was a hog butcher in Chicago during the World's Fair of 1893.
And before he would go into the slaughter pen, he would put on this mask, this pig mask that he'd made from one of his other kills, and he would snort-- (snorts) you know, like a pig--
make 'em think he was one of them.
Then one day, he slipped and he fell.
The pigs, hogs tore him apart.
And they didn't find one piece of him anywhere.
So everyone assumed.
'Cause not too long after, his former customers, they started turning up dead;
gutted, skinned and hung upside down in the bathtub to drain, like a hog in his shop.
And they say if you stand in front of a mirror and say...
Here, piggy pig-pig.
"Here, piggy pig-pig,"
that he'll return for the slaughter.
And have you tried that?
Here, piggy pig... (squealing)
No.
But there's something inside of me that's afraid that I might.
And that scares the hell out of me.
We're gonna get to the root of what that is, I promise you.
Okay.
I want to see you again Wednesday, 3:00, all right?
Sure.
In the meantime, I want you to shave.
In a mirror?
Can you try, Derek?
Yeah.
Good.
Call me if you need me.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Dad?
Hey, honey.
I'm sorry, Daddy.
It's all my fault.
What?
No.
No, baby.
No, no, no.
Your mom and I both love you very much.
It's never gonna change.
It's the darkness.
It has me.
I have you.
Baby, I have you.
I have you.
She's a nurse in your department.
I think her name is Angie something?
She fainted during an ultrasound.
Right.
She's an ultrasound technician.
So she quit?
Would you ask her to call me, then?
Vivien Harmon.
Okay, thank, thank you.
Hi, Constance.
I'm so sorry about Adelaide.
I've been meaning to make a condolence call, and I've just been...
Moira tells me that you've been suffering terribly.
That every time you leave the house, you're racked with violent morning sickness?
Yeah.
Well, you know, my mother always recommended a big platter of offal during the first trimester of pregnancy.
She preferred pork.
Oh, well, how nice of you to think of me during this...
I believe life is for the living, don't you?
Sweetbreads.
Now these two are thymus glands, one from the heart, one from the throat.
And this is the pancreas.
It's so good for mother and child.
Full of protein, vitamin C, all the B vitamins and iron.
And speaking of which... how is your other baby?
She was such a dear sweet child, and such a comfort to me when Addie passed.
Well, she's been very upset.
Spending a lot of time in her room.
Sometimes, children going through transition just need alone time.
Well, I, um, can't thank you enough for the offal.
Offal.
Moira, why don't you sauté these for Mrs. Harmon's lunch?
Do 'em the way that you used to do them for me, remember?
With sweet butter.
I'd be happy to do that for Mrs. Harmon.
(chuckles) We need that baby.
We need another... sweet child around here.
May I say something that could be considered out of turn, but that is sincerely heartfelt?
I guess so.
Cheating on one's pregnant wife qualifies as an unspeakable criminal act.
It's on a par with murder.
And I'll tell you one thing I know, if I know anything at all--
Dr. Harmon will cheat again, if given half the chance.
I hope I haven't upset you, speaking my mind so directly.
Just a pinch of the sea salt, a tiny squeeze of the lemon, if you like.
Although I prefer without.
And ma'am,
I've left the pancreas uncooked.
They say it's the tenderest organ of them all, especially when eaten raw.
Oh...
Uh, no,
I don't think so, Moira.
Think of the baby.
Mmm.
Mmm.
DEREK:
I don't think I can do this.
Have you been doing the exercises we talked about-- looking in the bathroom mirror at home?
Yeah, but I cheated.
I used my toaster-- it has a very reflective surface.
(chuckles) Okay, well, that's a start.
You're in my house now.
And you're safe.
You're safe.
I'm going to stand right outside this door.
I can't do it.
Here.
Use this.
But only if you have to.
Breathe...
I'm going to turn off the light.
I'm going to close the door, and I'll be right outside.
Breathe, just breathe.
That's it.
Turning off the light.
(whimpering)
And I'm going to shut the door.
(gasping, hyperventilating)
Think I'm having a heart attack!
I'm right here, Derek.
Five feet away.
Just say the words.
Nothing's going to happen.
Here, piggy, pig-pig.
(gasping):
Here... piggy... pig.
(screaming)
Derek!
Derek, it's okay.
It's okay.
There's-there's something in there!
It's okay.
It's okay.
(gasps)
There's no one in there.
You see?
(sobbing)
It's never going to stop.
I'm broken!
No, no, no, no...
I didn't get to the last pig.
Over 5,000 amnios, and not a single miscarriage, but who's counting?
And so this would-- with the Down syndrome...?
Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida.
The amnio results should put your mind at ease.
Sorry I'm late.
Traffic was insane.
You didn't have to leave work to come here.
Of course he should.
He's the daddy.
That's right, I'm the daddy.
We have to be nice to Mommy today.
And keep her off her feet.
Will do.
Regina is going to find the perfect spot so we don't hurt the baby.
Right there.
You're going to feel a tiny pinch.
I owe you an apology.
It attacked you too, didn't it?
No.
But I don't know what's real anymore.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
The Devil is real.
And he's not a little red man with horns and a tail.
He can be beautiful.
Because he's a fallen angel, and he used to be God's favorite.
Have you read the Book of Revelation?
No.
In Heaven, there's this woman in labor howling in pain.
And there's a red dragon with seven heads waiting so he can eat her baby.
But the Archangel Michael, he hurls the dragon down to earth.
From that moment on, the red dragon hates the woman, and declares war on her and all of her children.
That's us.
Oh, yeah, things have gotten pretty weird for me.
Me, too.
I can't eat, I can't sleep.
The nights are the worst.
I get four hours, if I'm lucky.
That's only with pills.
What kind of pills?
Can I have one?
They were over by the sofa.
Used to be a row of tables.
I get four or five of you sickos a year.
Usually freshmen.
What, are you a transfer?
You're that teacher.
You're like a hero.
Now you know what heroes look like.
Wait, I'm sorry.
I'm not like those other kids.
I know Tate.
I mean, I know his mom.
We moved next door to her.
Did you know him?
Before he did this?
I knew his face.
Didn't seem like a bad kid, actually.
He was in here a lot.
Kind of thoughtful, liked to read.
Byron, books on birds, random stuff.
Was he bullied or something?
Did he even know the kids he shot?
I just want to know why he did it.
Me, too.
Why are you bullshitting me?
!
If the bullet had been an inch to the right, it would've missed my spine and I would have walked out of here.
Might have even been able to stop him.
An inch higher, it would have killed me.
Sometimes shit just happens.
Good people don't just have a bad day and start shooting people.
Maybe he wasn't a good person.
Moira.
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.
You've lost the baby.
No, no, no, no.
Oh.
Stop.
Stop cleaning and come sit down.
Have a seat.
I'm afraid we're going to have to let you go.
I don't understand.
The house is spotless.
It has nothing to do with you, believe me.
Mrs. Harmon, this is not a job.
For me, coming here is a reprieve.
I understand.
We just can't afford it.
Then I'll work for free, till you sell.
I'll make the house gleam and glitter for the new owners.
Then, perhaps, they'll hire me.
Mrs. Harmon, I've had my share of regrets.
But leaving an expectant mother in the time of her need will not be one of them.
I'm staying.
(laughing)
You're being so dramatic.
I'm not helpless, Moira.
Well, I'm not one to belabor a point, but where has the time gone?
You must be famished.
I mean, I am hungry.
Constance dropped by earlier with another delicious delicacy.
No.
I don't want you cooking for me.
Please, don't go to the trouble.
Come on.
No trouble at all.
It's served raw.
So you and the baby get the full measure of vitamins.
It's the most nutritious organ of them all.
It came from an organic farm.
I hear the raw food movement is really taking off.
For the baby.

Get out of my house!
Look at what he did to me.
(screaming)
Excuse me, ma'am, I don't want to bother you, but I'm hurt and needing some help.
Has my wife medicated you?
Are you here for the procedure?

It's okay.
Have you been doing the cognitive exercises we talked about?
Yes.
Nothing helps.
I can't take this anxiety.
The other night, I meet a girl.
Allyson-- works in accounting.
There's a real chemistry there.
Derek, that's great.
Ask her out.
Get out of your own head.
I...
I would love to.
But what happens if she wants to come home with me some night?
How... how do I explain why all the mirrors are covered up?
Derek, you're doing this to yourself.
Think of it as the psychological law of physics.
The more you fear something, the more power you give it.
You need to conquer this thing, Derek.
You're going to go home, you're going to look in the mirror, and you're going to say those words.
They're not magic words.
There is no Piggy Man.
Once you face that, you can finally start to deal with the real issues in your life.
I mean, you're absolutely right.
I want to do it.
I can do it.
The moment you do... you'll be free.
(bell tolling)
Angela?
Vivien.
Thank you so much for agreeing to meet with me.
Of course.
That's, uh, probably close enough.
When you gave me the address,
I didn't realize it was a church.
It's where I feel safe.
The hospital said you quit your job, but they didn't say why.
I've been concerned because of the ultrasound and...
They said that the machine malfunctioned, but... it seemed to me that you saw something that scared you.
Yes, and I've been praying about it ever since.
I saw the unclean thing, what you carry in your womb.
The plague of nations, the Beast.
Okay, so you didn't see anything.
So... the machine malfunctioned.
It did not.
I saw the little hooves.
You need some help.
"And the woman was full of the filthiness of her fornication!

Pig.

Here, piggy, piggy, pig.
Who you calling a pig?

What the hell did you do?
This was supposed to be a robbery.
Now it's murder, you asshole.
Called me a pig.
We got to get out of here.
(both chuckling)
I am beginning to think you're a fraud.
And that nail polish is vulgar.
Don't take it out on me just because your dead daughter is mad at you.
Now, why the hell would you say that to me?
Because you're capable of handling the truth.
I see it all the time.
The dead can hold a grudge better than most Scorpios.
I want to talk to her, Billie.
I have one last thing... that I have to say to her.
I just miss her so terribly.
She was my reason for living.
She says you should have told her that when she was alive.
She's a feisty one.
Talk to her.
She's here.
Come on.
(sighs, chuckles)
Baby...
I am so sorry.
I'm sorry because... most of the time that I was with you, especially when you were younger,
I was just so overwhelmed.
It wasn't easy being a single parent, and you were such a handful.
So I guess I forgot to say the things that I was supposed to say, but that I honestly always felt in my heart.
I am so proud of you, Addie.
I admire you so...
(sighs) for what you were able to overcome.
And I think you're beautiful.
Addie, I think you are the most beautiful girl...
I ever met.
She says thank you.
And that she knows.
And that where she is now, on the other side... she's a pretty girl at last.
(laughs)
She also wants you to know that she's grateful.
For not getting her to the lawn at the old house.
She doesn't want to be with Tate.
She's afraid of him now that she knows the truth.
CONSTANCE:
Please don't hurt him!

TATE:
I like birds, too.
Why do you like them?
'Cause they can fly away when things get too crazy, I guess.
Are you going to tell your parents?
About the pills?
No.
I've been sleeping a lot.
They think I'm depressed.
Are you?
I'm sad.
Me, too.
Violet.
Something has changed in you.
Toward me.
You're distant, cold.
I don't know what I've done, but I'll leave you alone from now on if that's what you want.
Is that what you want?
You know why I'd leave you alone?
Because I care about your feelings more than mine.
I love you.
There, I said it-- not just on some chalkboard.
I would never let anybody or anything hurt you.
I've never felt that way about anyone.
Come here.
I'm tired.
Me too.

He's shooting people.

Shit, I don't, I don't know, man.
That's not my blood.
I was right next to Mark Finstein, and the guy shot him in the freaking skull.

Of course not.
She's probably at the grocery store, buying some frozen fare to reheat for your supper tonight.
You found out about Tate, didn't you?
I knew you would.
Get out of my house!
This is not happening.
I questioned my sanity when I first found out..
But this house... this house will make you a believer.
You see, Violet, we were living here when Tate lost his way.
And I believe that the house drove him to it.
What?
No.
That can't be real.
You're a smart girl.
How can you be so arrogant to think that there's only one reality that you're able to see?
I want you to meet someone.
Violet Harmon, meet Billie Dean Howard.
The child has no manners.
Billie is a gifted medium.
She can help.
You're confused.
Overwhelmed.
Why wouldn't you be?
I never asked for any of this.
None of us did.
But nothing can be done once one's been chosen.
Billie has been helping me for years.
I first found her on Craigslist.
I've been through all the phonies, but she is 100% authentic.
I've just come from a meeting at Lifetime;
they're interested in making a pilot with me.
A Craigslist psychic with a Hollywood agent.
Who'd have thought?
A medium, dear.
I can't read your future.
That's a different gift.
Have some chamomile tea.
It'll calm the nerves.
I'm in a dream.
I used to be like you.
Until I was 25.
When out of the blue, my cleaning lady shows up as I'm brushing my teeth.
Except she's got no toilet brush and rubber gloves, she's naked and bloody.
Her husband murdered her with an ice pick.
It's hard to keep good help.
BILLIE:
Do you think I wanted a bloody Mexican ghost in my bathroom?
All I wanted was to improve my tennis game and unseat Charlotte Whitney as president of my book club.
But I was chosen.
And when you're chosen, you either get with the program or you go crazy.
Understanding the truth is your only choice.
What's your version of the truth?
There are some who have an understandably violent and vengeful reaction to being horribly murdered.
They refuse to move on, until they exact their pound of flesh.
Then there are a very few souls, like Tate, who don't even know they're dead, who walk among the living in child-like confusion.
That's why I wanted him to see your father.
I was hoping your father might help him achieve some clarity about himself so that he could see the truth on his own.
We must help him cross over, Violet.
This is bullshit.
I was set up.
My computer was-- someone messed with my...
Who is Mary?
VIVIEN:
Violet, she wants to talk to you.
(monitor beeping steadily)
I don't understand you.
Never will understand you.
Does that mean anything to you?
"They don't understand you?"
(sobs)

Can I trust her?
I'm not sure.

Everything's secure.
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just hearing things.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
Oh, no, it's not a waste of time.
Not at all.
That's what I'm here for.
Even if it's only for your peace of mind.
Thank you.
My husband just moved out recently, so...
He had an affair, and don't know why I'm telling you this.
Oh, no.
It's okay.
Actually, we get sensitivity training.
We deal with people's worst fears, real or imaginary.
That makes sense.
But, actually, with the, uh, with the infidelity,
I have firsthand experience with that.
Hmm.
Not me.
No, my wife.
With another man?
It was a woman.
Yeah, I know.
A lot of guys would be into that, right?
Me, not so much.
(door opens)
What happened now?
I thought I heard somebody.
Where?
Outside or inside?
Outside.
I looked around, checked the alarm system.
Everything seems to be working fine.
Thanks for filling in.
Oh, by the way, the woman that I took out of here?
She never made it to the police station.
What?
I don't understand.
She must have hopped out of my vehicle at a stop sign or something.
Please keep you alarm on even when you're home.
Thank you.
(door opens, closes)
What are you doing here?
I've got to work, Vivien.
Rent an office.
We don't the have the money, Viv!
I promise I'll leave right after my last patient.
I don't want you here.
You brought this on yourself.
(sighs) You're right.
And you're angry.
If you violated our marriage right in front of me, I'd be furious.
But I need a place to work, Vivien.
We need the money.
I'm finding it really hard to look at your face.
'Cause I really, really, really want to bash it in.
I find you disgusting... and disappointing as a man.
And we're gonna end this marriage and we're gonna sell this house and I'll let you be a father to our kids because I happen to think that you're a good one.
But I'm not gonna be your friend.
I will merely tolerate you.
And you can see your patients in the house, but I want you to leave after your last session of the day.

I don't think I heard that one before.
Oh, God.
It's, uh, it's terrifying.
Okay, story goes, um... he was a hog butcher in Chicago during the World's Fair of 1893.
And before he would go into the slaughter pen, he would put on this mask, this pig mask that he'd made from one of his other kills, and he would snort-- (snorts) you know, like a pig--
make 'em think he was one of them.
Then one day, he slipped and he fell.
The pigs, hogs tore him apart.
And they didn't find one piece of him anywhere.
So everyone assumed.
'Cause not too long after, his former customers, they started turning up dead;

And I'm going to shut the door.
(gasping, hyperventilating)
Think I'm having a heart attack!
I'm right here, Derek.
Five feet away.
Just say the words.
Nothing's going to happen.
Here, piggy, pig-pig.
(gasping):
Here... piggy... pig.
(screaming)
Derek!
Derek, it's okay.
It's okay.
There's-there's something in there!
It's okay.
It's okay.
(gasps)
There's no one in there.
You see?
(sobbing)
It's never going to stop.
I'm broken!
No, no, no, no...
I didn't get to the last pig.
Over 5,000 amnios, and not a single miscarriage, but who's counting?
And so this would-- with the Down syndrome...?
Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida.
The amnio results should put your mind at ease.
Sorry I'm late.
Traffic was insane.
You didn't have to leave work to come here.
Of course he should.
He's the daddy.
That's right, I'm the daddy.
We have to be nice to Mommy today.
And keep her off her feet.
Will do.
Regina is going to find the perfect spot so we don't hurt the baby.
Right there.
You're going to feel a tiny pinch.
I owe you an apology.
It attacked you too, didn't it?
No.
But I don't know what's real anymore.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
The Devil is real.
And he's not a little red man with horns and a tail.
He can be beautiful.
Because he's a fallen angel, and he used to be God's favorite.
Have you read the Book of Revelation?
No.
In Heaven, there's this woman in labor howling in pain.
And there's a red dragon with seven heads waiting so he can eat her baby.
But the Archangel Michael, he hurls the dragon down to earth.
From that moment on, the red dragon hates the woman, and declares war on her and all of her children.
That's us.
Oh, yeah, things have gotten pretty weird for me.
Me, too.
I can't eat, I can't sleep.
The nights are the worst.
I get four hours, if I'm lucky.
That's only with pills.
What kind of pills?
Can I have one?
They were over by the sofa.
Used to be a row of tables.
I get four or five of you sickos a year.
Usually freshmen.
What, are you a transfer?
You're that teacher.
You're like a hero.
Now you know what heroes look like.
Wait, I'm sorry.
I'm not like those other kids.
I know Tate.
I mean, I know his mom.
We moved next door to her.
Did you know him?
Before he did this?
I knew his face.
Didn't seem like a bad kid, actually.
He was in here a lot.
Kind of thoughtful, liked to read.
Byron, books on birds, random stuff.
Was he bullied or something?
Did he even know the kids he shot?
I just want to know why he did it.
Me, too.
Why are you bullshitting me?
!
If the bullet had been an inch to the right, it would've missed my spine and I would have walked out of here.
Might have even been able to stop him.
An inch higher, it would have killed me.
Sometimes shit just happens.
Good people don't just have a bad day and start shooting people.
Maybe he wasn't a good person.
Moira.
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.
You've lost the baby.
No, no, no, no.
Oh.
Stop.
Stop cleaning and come sit down.
Have a seat.
I'm afraid we're going to have to let you go.
I don't understand.
The house is spotless.
It has nothing to do with you, believe me.
Mrs. Harmon, this is not a job.
For me, coming here is a reprieve.
I understand.
We just can't afford it.
Then I'll work for free, till you sell.
I'll make the house gleam and glitter for the new owners.
Then, perhaps, they'll hire me.
Mrs. Harmon, I've had my share of regrets.
But leaving an expectant mother in the time of her need will not be one of them.
I'm staying.
(laughing)
You're being so dramatic.
I'm not helpless, Moira.
Well, I'm not one to belabor a point, but where has the time gone?
You must be famished.
I mean, I am hungry.
Constance dropped by earlier with another delicious delicacy.
No.
I don't want you cooking for me.
Please, don't go to the trouble.
Come on.
No trouble at all.
It's served raw.
So you and the baby get the full measure of vitamins.
It's the most nutritious organ of them all.
It came from an organic farm.
I hear the raw food movement is really taking off.
For the baby.

(touchpad beeping)
Tate?
Tate?
I'm not playing hide-and-seek, Tate.
You have to leave now!
(ghostly laughter)
Get out of my house!
Look at what he did to me.
(screaming)
Excuse me, ma'am, I don't want to bother you, but I'm hurt and needing some help.
Has my wife medicated you?
Are you here for the procedure?
(rock music blaring)
(music stops)
(sobbing)
(gasping, shuddering)
Don't you die on me, Violet!
No.
Don't you die!
Don't you die on me.
Violet!
Stay with me.
(gagging)
(sobbing)
It's okay.
Have you been doing the cognitive exercises we talked about?
Yes.
Nothing helps.
I can't take this anxiety.
The other night, I meet a girl.
Allyson-- works in accounting.
There's a real chemistry there.
Derek, that's great.
Ask her out.
Get out of your own head.
I...
I would love to.
But what happens if she wants to come home with me some night?
How... how do I explain why all the mirrors are covered up?
Derek, you're doing this to yourself.
Think of it as the psychological law of physics.
The more you fear something, the more power you give it.
You need to conquer this thing, Derek.
You're going to go home, you're going to look in the mirror, and you're going to say those words.
They're not magic words.
There is no Piggy Man.
Once you face that, you can finally start to deal with the real issues in your life.
I mean, you're absolutely right.
I want to do it.
I can do it.
The moment you do... you'll be free.
(bell tolling)
Angela?
Vivien.
Thank you so much for agreeing to meet with me.
Of course.
That's, uh, probably close enough.
When you gave me the address,
I didn't realize it was a church.
It's where I feel safe.
The hospital said you quit your job, but they didn't say why.
I've been concerned because of the ultrasound and...
They said that the machine malfunctioned, but... it seemed to me that you saw something that scared you.
Yes, and I've been praying about it ever since.
I saw the unclean thing, what you carry in your womb.
The plague of nations, the Beast.
Okay, so you didn't see anything.
So... the machine malfunctioned.
It did not.
I saw the little hooves.
You need some help.
"And the woman was full of the filthiness of her fornication!
"The mother of harlots and abominations of the Earth!"
(sighs)
Here, piggy, piggy, pig.
Here, piggy, piggy, pig.
Pig.
(laughs quietly)
Here, piggy, piggy, pig.
Who you calling a pig?
(gun fires)
What the hell did you do?
This was supposed to be a robbery.
Now it's murder, you asshole.
Called me a pig.
We got to get out of here.
(both chuckling)
I am beginning to think you're a fraud.
And that nail polish is vulgar.
Don't take it out on me just because your dead daughter is mad at you.
Now, why the hell would you say that to me?
Because you're capable of handling the truth.
I see it all the time.
The dead can hold a grudge better than most Scorpios.
I want to talk to her, Billie.
I have one last thing... that I have to say to her.
I just miss her so terribly.
She was my reason for living.
She says you should have told her that when she was alive.
She's a feisty one.
Talk to her.
She's here.
Come on.
(sighs, chuckles)
Baby...
I am so sorry.
I'm sorry because... most of the time that I was with you, especially when you were younger,
I was just so overwhelmed.
It wasn't easy being a single parent, and you were such a handful.
So I guess I forgot to say the things that I was supposed to say, but that I honestly always felt in my heart.
I am so proud of you, Addie.
I admire you so...
(sighs) for what you were able to overcome.
And I think you're beautiful.
Addie, I think you are the most beautiful girl...
I ever met.
She says thank you.
And that she knows.
And that where she is now, on the other side... she's a pretty girl at last.
(laughs)
She also wants you to know that she's grateful.
For not getting her to the lawn at the old house.
She doesn't want to be with Tate.
She's afraid of him now that she knows the truth.
CONSTANCE:
Please don't hurt him!
Tate!
Tate!
Wait!
Let me just talk to him!
Will you please just let me talk to him?
Tate!
Tate!
No, please.
He'll go peacefully.
CONSTANCE:
He's just a child!
He's just a child!
Please don't hurt my son.
(sirens wailing)
(whispers gunshot sound)
(heavy gunfire)
Why did you do it?
(sirens wailing, horns blasting)
TATE:
I like birds, too.
Why do you like them?
'Cause they can fly away when things get too crazy, I guess.
Are you going to tell your parents?
About the pills?
No.
I've been sleeping a lot.
They think I'm depressed.
Are you?
I'm sad.
Me, too.
Violet.
Something has changed in you.
Toward me.
You're distant, cold.
I don't know what I've done, but I'll leave you alone from now on if that's what you want.
Is that what you want?
You know why I'd leave you alone?
Because I care about your feelings more than mine.
I love you.
There, I said it-- not just on some chalkboard.
I would never let anybody or anything hurt you.
I've never felt that way about anyone.
Come here.
I'm tired.
Me too.
(doorbell ringing, knocking on door)
Does Tate Langdon live here?
He's my son.
Why?
What has he done?
All right, make entry.
(sirens wailing in distance)
Stop it.
Ah, okay.
(two gunshots)
(people screaming in distance)
(three gunshots)
(footsteps running)
What the hell, dude?
Somebody's shooting up the school.
He's shooting people.
Wait, are you hit?
Where are you hit?
Shit, I don't, I don't know, man.
That's not my blood.
I was right next to Mark Finstein, and the guy shot him in the freaking skull.
Who's doing this?
I-I don't know.
We need to get the hell out of here!
(two gunshots)
Go!
Go!
(footsteps walking slowly)
(door handle rattling)
(muffled whimpering)
(sniffles)
(footsteps slowly walking away)
(whispers):
Block the door!
Get the door!
(rapid gunshots)
(boy whistling tune)

(footsteps walking)
(whispers):
Hey.
No, no.
Please, no!
(gunshot)
(whimpers softly)
(footsteps walking)
(gunshot, thud)
Screw this.
It's going to be okay.
Ev-Everything is going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.
(shell clatters on floor)
Hey!
It's enough.
Get out of here.
(gunshot)
(sobs)
(pumps shotgun)
Oh, God!
(sirens approaching)
(sobbing)
Oh, God.
(sobbing)
Please!
(screams)
Why?

(sobs):
Why?
(pumps shotgun)
(sirens getting closer)
Please.
(gunshot)
(sirens wailing)
CONSTANCE:
Let me just talk to him!
Please, just let me talk to him!
Tate!
(sobbing):
Tate.
No, please.
He'll go peacefully.
He's just a child!
He's just a child!
Tate!
Tate!
Oh, God, please don't do this!
He's just a child!
Let me talk to him!

¶ ¶
(panting)
Mom?
Mom?
Mommy.
She's not here.
Where is she?
Did you hurt her?
(chuckles)
Of course not.
She's probably at the grocery store, buying some frozen fare to reheat for your supper tonight.
You found out about Tate, didn't you?
I knew you would.
Get out of my house!
This is not happening.
I questioned my sanity when I first found out.
But this house... this house will make you a believer.
You see, Violet, we were living here when Tate lost his way.
And I believe that the house drove him to it.
What?
No.
That can't be real.
You're a smart girl.
How can you be so arrogant to think that there's only one reality that you're able to see?
I want you to meet someone.
Violet Harmon, meet Billie Dean Howard.
The child has no manners.
Billie is a gifted medium.
She can help.
You're confused.
Overwhelmed.
Why wouldn't you be?
I never asked for any of this.
None of us did.
But nothing can be done once one's been chosen.
Billie has been helping me for years.
I first found her on Craigslist.
I've been through all the phonies, but she is 100% authentic.
I've just come from a meeting at Lifetime;
they're interested in making a pilot with me.
A Craigslist psychic with a Hollywood agent.
Who'd have thought?
A medium, dear.
I can't read your future.
That's a different gift.
Have some chamomile tea.
It'll calm the nerves.
I'm in a dream.
I used to be like you.
Until I was 25.
When out of the blue, my cleaning lady shows up as I'm brushing my teeth.
Except she's got no toilet brush and rubber gloves, she's naked and bloody.
Her husband murdered her with an ice pick.
It's hard to keep good help.
BILLIE:
Do you think I wanted a bloody Mexican ghost in my bathroom?
All I wanted was to improve my tennis game and unseat Charlotte Whitney as president of my book club.
But I was chosen.
And when you're chosen, you either get with the program or you go crazy.
Understanding the truth is your only choice.
What's your version of the truth?
There are some who have an understandably violent and vengeful reaction to being horribly murdered.
They refuse to move on, until they exact their pound of flesh.
Then there are a very few souls, like Tate, who don't even know they're dead, who walk among the living in child-like confusion.
That's why I wanted him to see your father.
I was hoping your father might help him achieve some clarity about himself so that he could see the truth on his own.
We must help him cross over, Violet.
This is bullshit.
I was set up.
My computer was-- someone messed with my...
Who is Mary?
VIVIEN:
Violet, she wants totalkto you.
(monitor beeping steadily)
I don't understand you.
Never will understand you.
Does that mean anything to you?
"They don't understand you?"
(sobs)
(door opens, closes)
Can I trust her?
I'm not sure.
(Bach's "Cello Suite No. 5 in C Minor" playing)
(screams)
(ring clinks on table)
(beeps)
Okay, so I've checked the perimeter of the property, the upstairs, the basement.
Everything's secure.
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just hearing things.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
Oh, no, it's not a waste of time.
Not at all.
That's what I'm here for.
Even if it's only for your peace of mind.
Thank you.
My husband just moved out recently, so...
He had an affair, and don't know why I'm telling you this.
Oh, no.
It's okay.
Actually, we get sensitivity training.
We deal with people's worst fears, real or imaginary.
That makes sense.
But, actually, with the, uh, with the infidelity,
I have firsthand experience with that.
Hmm.
Not me.
No, my wife.
With another man?
It was a woman.
Yeah, I know.
A lot of guys would be into that, right?
Me, not so much.
(door opens)
What happened now?
I thought I heard somebody.
Where?
Outside or inside?
Outside.
I looked around, checked the alarm system.
Everything seems to be working fine.
Thanks for filling in.
Oh, by the way, the woman that I took out of here?
She never made it to the police station.
What?
I don't understand.
She must have hopped out of my vehicle at a stop sign or something.
Please keep you alarm on even when you're home.
Thank you.
(door opens, closes)
What are you doing here?
I've got to work, Vivien.
Rent an office.
We don't the have the money, Viv!
I promise I'll leave right after my last patient.
I don't want you here.
You brought this on yourself.
(sighs) You're right.
And you're angry.
If you violated our marriage right in front of me, I'd be furious.
But I need a place to work, Vivien.
We need the money.
I'm finding it really hard to look at your face.
'Cause I really, really, really want to bash it in.
I find you disgusting... and disappointing as a man.
And we're gonna end this marriage and we're gonna sell this house and I'll let you be a father to our kids because I happen to think that you're a good one.
But I'm not gonna be your friend.
I will merely tolerate you.
And you can see your patients in the house, but I want you to leave after your last session of the day.
¶ ¶
Are you scared now?
BEN:
Urbanlegends?
Urban legends, they, they terrify me.
Lately, it's gotten so bad I can't even function.
When you say "urban legends..."
All of 'em:
Bloody Mary, Candy Man,
Lady in White.
Children's ghost stories.
When I was younger, my brothers would tell them to me.
Hold me down, force me to listen to 'em.
Older brothers can be mean.
They were younger.
I see.
Nothing else scares me:
terrorism, disease, violent crime, crashing economy.
Just these stories that I know are utter bullshit.
I'm paralyzed, Doctor.
I can't maintain a relationship.
What girl wants to screw a grown man who has to sleep with his lights on?
Speaking of sleep, I can't.
I don't.
I binge eat.
I smoke like a fish.
Lately, it's gotten a lot worse.
I must look terrible.
I haven't had the courage to look in a mirror in the last week.
Why's that?
Piggy Man.
Piggy Man?
I don't think I heard that one before.
Oh, God.
It's, uh, it's terrifying.
Okay, story goes, um... he was a hog butcher in Chicago during the World's Fair of 1893.
And before he would go into the slaughter pen, he would put on this mask, this pig mask that he'd made from one of his other kills, and he would snort-- (snorts) you know, like a pig--
make 'em think he was one of them.
Then one day, he slipped and he fell.
The pigs, hogs tore him apart.
And they didn't find one piece of him anywhere.
So everyone assumed.
'Cause not too long after, his former customers, they started turning up dead;
gutted, skinned and hung upside down in the bathtub to drain, like a hog in his shop.
And they say if you stand in front of a mirror and say...
Here, piggy pig-pig.
"Here, piggy pig-pig,"
that he'll return for the slaughter.
And have you tried that?
Here, piggy pig... (squealing)
No.
But there's something inside of me that's afraid that I might.
And that scares the hell out of me.
We're gonna get to the root of what that is, I promise you.
Okay.
I want to see you again Wednesday, 3:00, all right?
Sure.
In the meantime, I want you to shave.
In a mirror?
Can you try, Derek?
Yeah.
Good.
Call me if you need me.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Dad?
Hey, honey.
I'm sorry, Daddy.
It's all my fault.
What?
No.
No, baby.
No, no, no.
Your mom and I both love you very much.
It's never gonna change.
It's the darkness.
It has me.
I have you.
Baby, I have you.
I have you.
She's a nurse in your department.
I think her name is Angie something?
She fainted during an ultrasound.
Right.
She's an ultrasound technician.
So she quit?
Would you ask her to call me, then?
Vivien Harmon.
Okay, thank, thank you.
Hi, Constance.
I'm so sorry about Adelaide.
I've been meaning to make a condolence call, and I've just been...
Moira tells me that you've been suffering terribly.
That every time you leave the house, you're racked with violent morning sickness?
Yeah.
Well, you know, my mother always recommended a big platter of offal during the first trimester of pregnancy.
She preferred pork.
Oh, well, how nice of you to think of me during this...
I believe life is for the living, don't you?
Sweetbreads.
Now these two are thymus glands, one from the heart, one from the throat.
And this is the pancreas.
It's so good for mother and child.
Full of protein, vitamin C, all the B vitamins and iron.
And speaking of which... how is your other baby?
She was such a dear sweet child, and such a comfort to me when Addie passed.
Well, she's been very upset.
Spending a lot of time in her room.
Sometimes, children going through transition just need alone time.
Well, I, um, can't thank you enough for the offal.
Offal.
Moira, why don't you sauté these for Mrs. Harmon's lunch?
Do 'em the way that you used to do them for me, remember?
With sweet butter.
I'd be happy to do that for Mrs. Harmon.
(chuckles) We need that baby.
We need another... sweet child around here.
May I say something that could be considered out of turn, but that is sincerely heartfelt?
I guess so.
Cheating on one's pregnant wife qualifies as an unspeakable criminal act.
It's on a par with murder.
And I'll tell you one thing I know, if I know anything at all--
Dr. Harmon will cheat again, if given half the chance.
I hope I haven't upset you, speaking my mind so directly.
Just a pinch of the sea salt, a tiny squeeze of the lemon, if you like.
Although I prefer without.
And ma'am,
I've left the pancreas uncooked.
They say it's the tenderest organ of them all, especially when eaten raw.
Oh...
Uh, no,
I don't think so, Moira.
Think of the baby.
Mmm.
Mmm.
DEREK:
I don't think Icando this.
Have you been doing the exercises we talked about-- looking in the bathroom mirror at home?
Yeah, but I cheated.
I used my toaster-- it has a very reflective surface.
(chuckles) Okay, well, that's a start.
You're in my house now.
And you're safe.
You're safe.
I'm going to stand right outside this door.
I can't do it.
Here.
Use this.
But only if you have to.
Breathe...
I'm going to turn off the light.
I'm going to close the door, and I'll be right outside.
Breathe, just breathe.
That's it.
Turning off the light.
(whimpering)
And I'm going to shut the door.
(gasping, hyperventilating)
Think I'm having a heart attack!
I'm right here, Derek.
Five feet away.
Just say the words.
Nothing's going to happen.
Here, piggy, pig-pig.
(gasping):
Here... piggy... pig.
(screaming)
Derek!
Derek, it's okay.
It's okay.
There's-there's something in there!
It's okay.
It's okay.
(gasps)
There's no one in there.
You see?
(sobbing)
It's never going to stop.
I'm broken!
No, no, no, no...
I didn't get to the last pig.
Over 5,000 amnios, and not a single miscarriage, but who's counting?
And so this would-- with the Down syndrome...?
Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida.
The amnio results should put your mind at ease.
Sorry I'm late.
Traffic was insane.
You didn't have to leave work to come here.
Of course he should.
He's the daddy.
That's right, I'm the daddy.
We have to be nice to Mommy today.
And keep her off her feet.
Will do.
Regina is going to find the perfect spot so we don't hurt the baby.
Right there.
You're going to feel a tiny pinch.
I owe you an apology.
It attacked you too, didn't it?
No.
But I don't know what's real anymore.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
The Devil is real.
And he's not a little red man with horns and a tail.
He can be beautiful.
Because he's a fallen angel, and he used to be God's favorite.
Have you read the Book of Revelation?
No.
In Heaven, there's this woman in labor howling in pain.
And there's a red dragon with seven heads waiting so he can eat her baby.
But the Archangel Michael, he hurls the dragon down to earth.
From that moment on, the red dragon hates the woman, and declares war on her and all of her children.
That's us.
Oh, yeah, things have gotten pretty weird for me.
Me, too.
I can't eat, I can't sleep.
The nights are the worst.
I get four hours, if I'm lucky.
That's only with pills.
What kind of pills?
Can I have one?
They were over by the sofa.
Used to be a row of tables.
I get four or five of you sickos a year.
Usually freshmen.
What, are you a transfer?
You're that teacher.
You're like a hero.
Now you know what heroes look like.
Wait, I'm sorry.
I'm not like those other kids.
I know Tate.
I mean, I know his mom.
We moved next door to her.
Did you know him?

Did he even know the kids he shot?
I just want to know why he did it.
Me, too.
Why are you bullshitting me?
!
If the bullet had been an inch to the right, it would've missed my spine and I would have walked out of here.
Might have even been able to stop him.
An inch higher, it would have killed me.
Sometimes shit just happens.
Good people don't just have a bad day and start shooting people.
Maybe he wasn't a good person.
Moira.
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.
You've lost the baby.
No, no, no, no.
Oh.
Stop.
Stop cleaning and come sit down.
Have a seat.
I'm afraid we're going to have to let you go.
I don't understand.
The house is spotless.
It has nothing to do with you, believe me.
Mrs. Harmon, this is not a job.
For me, coming here is a reprieve.
I understand.
We just can't afford it.
Then I'll work for free, till you sell.
I'll make the house gleam and glitter for the new owners.
Then, perhaps, they'll hire me.
Mrs. Harmon, I've had my share of regrets.
But leaving an expectant mother in the time of her need will not be one of them.
I'm staying.
(laughing)
You're being so dramatic.
I'm not helpless, Moira.
Well, I'm not one to belabor a point, but where has the time gone?
You must be famished.
I mean, I am hungry.
Constance dropped by earlier with another delicious delicacy.
No.
I don't want you cooking for me.
Please, don't go to the trouble.
Come on.
No trouble at all.
It's served raw.
So you and the baby get the full measure of vitamins.
It's the most nutritious organ of them all.
It came from an organic farm.
I hear the raw food movement is really taking off.
For the baby.

(touchpad beeping)
Tate?
Tate?
I'm not playing hide-and-seek, Tate.
You have to leave now!
(ghostly laughter)
Get out of my house!
Look at what he did to me.
(screaming)
Excuse me, ma'am, I don't want to bother you, but I'm hurt and needing some help.
Has my wife medicated you?
Are you here for the procedure?
(rock music blaring)
(music stops)
(sobbing)
(gasping, shuddering)
Don't you die on me, Violet!
No.
Don't you die!
Don't you die on me.
Violet!
Stay with me.
(gagging)
(sobbing)
It's okay.
Have you been doing the cognitive exercises we talked about?
Yes.
Nothing helps.
I can't take this anxiety.
The other night, I meet a girl.
Allyson-- works in accounting.
There's a real chemistry there.
Derek, that's great.
Ask her out.
Get out of your own head.
I...
I would love to.
But what happens if she wants to come home with me some night?
How... how do I explain why all the mirrors are covered up?
Derek, you're doing this to yourself.
Thinkofit as the psychologicallawof physics.
Themoreyoufearsomething, themorepoweryou giveit.
You need to conquer this thing, Derek.
You're going to go home, you're going to look in the mirror, and you're going to say those words.
They're not magic words.
There is no Piggy Man.
Once you face that, you can finally start to deal with the real issues in your life.
I mean, you're absolutely right.
I want to do it.
I can do it.
The moment you do... you'll be free.
(bell tolling)
Angela?
Vivien.
Thank you so much for agreeing to meet with me.
Of course.
That's, uh, probably close enough.
When you gave me the address,
I didn't realize it was a church.
It's where I feel safe.
The hospital said you quit your job, but they didn't say why.
I've been concerned because of the ultrasound and...
They said that the machine malfunctioned, but... it seemed to me that you saw something that scared you.
Yes, and I've been praying about it ever since.
I saw the unclean thing, what you carry in your womb.
The plague of nations, the Beast.
Okay, so you didn't see anything.
So... the machine malfunctioned.
It did not.
I saw the little hooves.
You need some help.
"And the woman was full of the filthiness of her fornication!
"The mother of harlots and abominations of the Earth!"
(sighs)
Here, piggy, piggy, pig.
Here, piggy, piggy, pig.
Pig.
(laughs quietly)
Here, piggy, piggy, pig.
Who you calling a pig?
(gun fires)
What the hell did you do?
This was supposed to be a robbery.
Now it's murder, you asshole.
Called me a pig.
We got to get out of here.
(both chuckling)
I am beginning to think you're a fraud.
And that nail polish is vulgar.
Don't take it out on me just because your dead daughter is mad at you.
Now, why the hell would you say that to me?
Because you're capable of handling the truth.
I see it all the time.
The dead can hold a grudge better than most Scorpios.
I want to talk to her, Billie.
I have one last thing... that I have to say to her.
I just miss her so terribly.
She was my reason for living.
She says you should have told her that when she was alive.
She's a feisty one.
Talk to her.
She's here.
Come on.
(sighs, chuckles)
Baby...
I am so sorry.
I'm sorry because... most of the time that I was with you, especially when you were younger,
I was just so overwhelmed.
It wasn't easy being a single parent, and you were such a handful.
So I guess I forgot to say the things that I was supposed to say, but that I honestly always felt in my heart.
I am so proud of you, Addie.
I admire you so...
(sighs) for what you were able to overcome.
And I think you're beautiful.
Addie, I think you are the most beautiful girl...
I ever met.
She says thank you.
And that she knows.
And that where she is now, on the other side... she's a pretty girl at last.
(laughs)
She also wants you to know that she's grateful.
For not getting her to the lawn at the old house.
She doesn't want to be with Tate.
She's afraid of him now that she knows the truth.
CONSTANCE:
Pleasedon'thurthim !
Tate!
Tate!
Wait!
Let me just talk to him!
Will you please just let me talk to him?
Tate!
Tate!
No, please.
He'll go peacefully.
CONSTANCE:
He's just a child!
He's just a child!
Please don't hurt my son.
(sirens wailing)
(whispers gunshot sound)
(heavy gunfire)
Why did you do it?
(sirens wailing, horns blasting)
TATE:
I like birds, too.
Why do you like them?
'Cause they can fly away when things get too crazy, I guess.
Are you going to tell your parents?
About the pills?
No.
I've been sleeping a lot.
They think I'm depressed.
Are you?
I'm sad.
Me, too.
Violet.
Something has changed in you.
Toward me.
You're distant, cold.
I don't know what I've done, but I'll leave you alone from now on if that's what you want.
Is that what you want?
You know why I'd leave you alone?
Because I care about your feelings more than mine.
I love you.
There, I said it-- not just on some chalkboard.
I would never let anybody or anything hurt you.
I've never felt that way about anyone.
Come here.
I'm tired.
Me, too.

Does Tate Langdon live here?
He's my son.
Why?
What has he done?
All right, make entry.
Stop it.
Ah, okay.
What the hell, dude?
Somebody's shooting up the school.
He's shooting people.
Wait, are you hit?
Where are you hit?
Shit, I don't, I don't know, man.
That's not my blood.
I was right next to Mark Finstein, and the guy shot him in the freaking skull.
Who's doing this?
I-I don't know.
We need to get the hell out of here!
Go!
Go!
Block the door!
Get the door!
Hey.
No, no.
Please, no!
Screw this.
It's going to be okay.
Ev-Everything is going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.
Hey!
It's enough.
Get out of here.
Oh, God!
Oh, God.
Please!
Why?
!
Why?
Please.
Let me just talk to him!
Please, just let me talk to him!
Tate!
Tate.
No, please.
He'll go peacefully.
He's just a child!
He's just a child!
Tate!
Tate!
Oh, God, please don't do this!
He's just a child!
Let me talk to him!
Mom?
Mom?
Mommy.
She's not here.
Where is she?
Did you hurt her?
Of course not.
She's probably at the grocery store, buying some frozen fare to reheat for your supper tonight.
You found out about Tate, didn't you?
I knew you would.
Get out of my house!
This is not happening.
I questioned my sanity when I first found out..
But this house... this house will make you a believer.
You see, Violet, we were living here when Tate lost his way.
And I believe that the house drove him to it.
What?
No.
That can't be real.
You're a smart girl.
How can you be so arrogant to think that there's only one reality that you're able to see?
I want you to meet someone.
Violet Harmon, meet Billie Dean Howard.
The child has no manners.
Billie is a gifted medium.
She can help.
You're confused.
Overwhelmed.
Why wouldn't you be?
I never asked for any of this.
None of us did.
But nothing can be done once one's been chosen.
Billie has been helping me for years.
I first found her on Craigslist.
I've been through all the phonies, but she is 100% authentic.
I've just come from a meeting at Lifetime;
they're interested in making a pilot with me.
A Craigslist psychic with a Hollywood agent.
Who'd have thought?
A medium, dear.
I can't read your future.
That's a different gift.
Have some chamomile tea.
It'll calm the nerves.
I'm in a dream.
I used to be like you.
Until I was 25.
When out of the blue, my cleaning lady shows up as I'm brushing my teeth.
Except she's got no toilet brush and rubber gloves, she's naked and bloody.
Her husband murdered her with an ice pick.
It's hard to keep good help.
Do you think I wanted a bloody Mexican ghost in my bathroom?
All I wanted was to improve my tennis game and unseat Charlotte Whitney as president of my book club.
But I was chosen.
And when you're chosen, you either get with the program or you go crazy.
Understanding the truth is your only choice.
What's your version of the truth?
There are some who have an understandably violent and vengeful reaction to being horribly murdered.
They refuse to move on, until they exact their pound of flesh.
Then there are a very few souls, like Tate, who don't even know they're dead, who walk among the living in child-like confusion.
That's why I wanted him to see your father.
I was hoping your father might help him achieve some clarity about himself so that he could see the truth on his own.
We must help him cross over, Violet.
This is bullshit.
I was set up.
My computer was-- someone messed with my...
Who is Mary?
Violet, she wants to talk to you.
I don't understand you.
Never will understand you.
Does that mean anything to you?
"They don't understand you?"
Can I trust her?
I'm not sure.
Okay, so I've checked the perimeter of the property, the upstairs, the basement.
Everything's secure.
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just hearing things.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
Oh, no, it's not a waste of time.
Not at all.
That's what I'm here for.
Even if it's only for your peace of mind.
Thank you.
My husband just moved out recently, so...
He had an affair, and don't know why I'm telling you this.
Oh, no.
It's okay.
Actually, we get sensitivity training.
We deal with people's worst fears, real or imaginary.
That makes sense.
But, actually, with the, uh, with the infidelity,
I have firsthand experience with that.
Hmm.
Not me.
No, my wife.
With another man?
It was a woman.
Yeah, I know.
A lot of guys would be into that, right?
Me, not so much.
What happened now?
I thought I heard somebody.
Where?
Outside or inside?
Outside.
I looked around, checked the alarm system.
Everything seems to be working fine.
Thanks for filling in.
Oh, by the way, the woman that I took out of here?
She never made it to the police station.
What?
I don't understand.
She must have hopped out of my vehicle at a stop sign or something.
Please keep you alarm on even when you're home.
Thank you.
What are you doing here?
I've got to work, Vivien.
Rent an office.
We don't the have the money, Viv!
I promise I'll leave right after my last patient.
I don't want you here.
You brought this on yourself.
You're right.
And you're angry.
If you violated our marriage right in front of me, I'd be furious.
But I need a place to work, Vivien.
We need the money.
I'm finding it really hard to look at your face.
'Cause I really, really, really want to bash it in.
I find you disgusting... and disappointing as a man.
And we're gonna end this marriage and we're gonna sell this house and I'll let you be a father to our kids because I happen to think that you're a good one.
But I'm not gonna be your friend.
I will merely tolerate you.
And you can see your patients in the house, but I want you to leave after your last session of the day.
Are you scared now?
Urban legends?
Urban legends, they, they terrify me.
Lately, it's gotten so bad I can't even function.
When you say "urban legends..."
Bloody Mary, Candy Man,
Lady in White.
Children's ghost stories.
When I was younger, my brothers would tell them to me.
Hold me down, force me to listen to 'em.
Older brothers can be mean.
They were younger.
I see.
Nothing else scares me:
terrorism, disease, violent crime, crashing economy.
Just these stories that I know are utter bullshit.
I'm paralyzed, Doctor.
I can't maintain a relationship.
What girl wants to screw a grown man who has to sleep with his lights on?
Speaking of sleep, I can't.
I don't.
I binge eat.
I smoke like a fish.
Lately, it's gotten a lot worse.
I must look terrible.
I haven't had the courage to look in a mirror in the last week.
Why's that?
Piggy Man.
Piggy Man?
I don't think I heard that one before.
Oh, God.
It's, uh, it's terrifying.
Okay, story goes, um... he was a hog butcher in Chicago during the World's Fair of 1893.
And before he would go into the slaughter pen, he would put on this mask, this pig mask that he'd made from one of his other kills, and he would snort-- you know, like a pig--
make 'em think he was one of them.
Then one day, he slipped and he fell.
The pigs, hogs tore him apart.
And they didn't find one piece of him anywhere.
So everyone assumed.
'Cause not too long after, his former customers, they started turning up dead;
gutted, skinned and hung upside down in the bathtub to drain, like a hog in his shop.
And they say if you stand in front of a mirror and say...
Here, piggy pig-pig.
"Here, piggy pig-pig,"
that he'll return for the slaughter.
And have you tried that?
Here, piggy pig...
No.
But there's something inside of me that's afraid that I might.
And that scares the hell out of me.
We're gonna get to the root of what that is, I promise you.
Okay.
I want to see you again Wednesday, 3:00, all right?
Sure.
In the meantime, I want you to shave.
In a mirror?
Can you try, Derek?
Yeah.
Good.
Call me if you need me.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Dad?
Hey, honey.
I'm sorry, Daddy.
It's all my fault.
What?
No.
No, baby.
No, no, no.
Your mom and I both love you very much.
It's never gonna change.
It's the darkness.
It has me.
I have you.
Baby, I have you.
I have you.
She's a nurse in your department.
I think her name is Angie something?
She fainted during an ultrasound.
Right.
She's an ultrasound technician.
So she quit?
Would you ask her to call me, then?
Vivien Harmon.
Okay, thank, thank you.
Hi, Constance.
I'm so sorry about Adelaide.
I've been meaning to make a condolence call, and I've just been...
Moira tells me that you've been suffering terribly.
That every time you leave the house, you're racked with violent morning sickness?
Yeah.
Well, you know, my mother always recommended a big platter of offal during the first trimester of pregnancy.
She preferred pork.
Oh, well, how nice of you to think of me during this...
I believe life is for the living, don't you?
Sweetbreads.
Now these two are thymus glands, one from the heart, one from the throat.
And this is the pancreas.
It's so good for mother and child.
Full of protein, vitamin C, all the B vitamins and iron.
And speaking of which... how is your other baby?
She was such a dear sweet child, and such a comfort to me when Addie passed.
Well, she's been very upset.
Spending a lot of time in her room.
Sometimes, children going through transition just need alone time.
Well, I, um, can't thank you enough for the offal.
Offal.
Moira, why don't you sauté these for Mrs. Harmon's lunch?
Do 'em the way that you used to do them for me, remember?
With sweet butter.
I'd be happy to do that for Mrs. Harmon.
We need that baby.
We need another... sweet child around here.
May I say something that could be considered out of turn, but that is sincerely heartfelt?
I guess so.
Cheating on one's pregnant wife qualifies as an unspeakable criminal act.
It's on a par with murder.
And I'll tell you one thing I know, if I know anything at all--
Dr. Harmon will cheat again, if given half the chance.
I hope I haven't upset you, speaking my mind so directly.
Just a pinch of the sea salt, a tiny squeeze of the lemon, if you like.
Although I prefer without.
And ma'am,
I've left the pancreas uncooked.
They say it's the tenderest organ of them all, especially when eaten raw.
Oh...
Uh, no,
I don't think so, Moira.
Think of the baby.
Mmm.
Mmm.
- I don't think
- I can do this.
Have you been doing the exercises we talked about-- looking in the bathroom mirror at home?
Yeah, but I cheated.
I used my toaster-- it has a very reflective surface.
Okay, well, that's a start.
You're in my house now.
And you're safe.
You're safe.
I'm going to stand right outside this door.
I can't do it.
Here.
Use this.
But only if you have to.
Breathe...
I'm going to turn off the light.
I'm going to close the door, and I'll be right outside.
Breathe, just breathe.
That's it.
Turning off the light.
And I'm going to shut the door.
Think I'm having a heart attack!
I'm right here, Derek.
Five feet away.
Just say the words.
Nothing's going to happen.
Here, piggy, pig-pig.
Here... piggy... pig.
Derek!
Derek, it's okay.
It's okay.
There's-there's something in there!
It's okay.
It's okay.
There's no one in there.
You see?
It's never going to stop.
I'm broken!
No, no, no, no...
I didn't get to the last pig.
Over 5,000 amnios, and not a single miscarriage, but who's counting?
And so this would-- with the Down syndrome...?
Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida.
The amnio results should put your mind at ease.
Sorry I'm late.
Traffic was insane.
You didn't have to leave work to come here.
Of course he should.
He's the daddy.
That's right, I'm the daddy.
We have to be nice to Mommy today.
And keep her off her feet.
Will do.
Regina is going to find the perfect spot so we don't hurt the baby.
Right there.
You're going to feel a tiny pinch.
I owe you an apology.
It attacked you too, didn't it?
No.
But I don't know what's real anymore.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
The Devil is real.
And he's not a little red man with horns and a tail.
He can be beautiful.
Because he's a fallen angel, and he used to be God's favorite.
Have you read the Book of Revelation?
No.
In Heaven, there's this woman in labor howling in pain.
And there's a red dragon with seven heads waiting so he can eat her baby.
But the Archangel Michael, he hurls the dragon down to earth.
From that moment on, the red dragon hates the woman, and declares war on her and all of her children.
That's us.
Oh, yeah, things have gotten pretty weird for me.
Me, too.
I can't eat, I can't sleep.
The nights are the worst.
I get four hours, if I'm lucky.
That's only with pills.
What kind of pills?
Can I have one?
They were over by the sofa.
Used to be a row of tables.
I get four or five of you sickos a year.
Usually freshmen.
What, are you a transfer?
You're that teacher.
You're like a hero.
Now you know what heroes look like.
Wait, I'm sorry.
I'm not like those other kids.
I know Tate.
I mean, I know his mom.
We moved next door to her.
Did you know him?
Before he did this?
I knew his face.
Didn't seem like a bad kid, actually.
He was in here a lot.
Kind of thoughtful, liked to read.
Byron, books on birds, random stuff.
Was he bullied or something?
Did he even know the kids he shot?
I just want to know why he did it.
Me, too.
Why are you bullshitting me?
!
If the bullet had been an inch to the right, it would've missed my spine and I would have walked out of here.
Might have even been able to stop him.
An inch higher, it would have killed me.
Sometimes shit just happens.
Good people don't just have a bad day and start shooting people.
Maybe he wasn't a good person.
Moira.
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.
You've lost the baby.
No, no, no, no.
Oh.
Stop.
Stop cleaning and come sit down.
Have a seat.
I'm afraid we're going to have to let you go.
I don't understand.
The house is spotless.
It has nothing to do with you, believe me.
Mrs. Harmon, this is not a job.
For me, coming here is a reprieve.
I understand.
We just can't afford it.
Then I'll work for free, till you sell.
I'll make the house gleam and glitter for the new owners.
Then, perhaps, they'll hire me.
Mrs. Harmon, I've had my share of regrets.
But leaving an expectant mother in the time of her need will not be one of them.
I'm staying.
You're being so dramatic.
I'm not helpless, Moira.
Well, I'm not one to belabor a point, but where has the time gone?
You must be famished.
I mean, I am hungry.

You have to leave now!
Get out of my house!
Look at what he did to me.
Excuse me, ma'am, I don't want to bother you, but I'm hurt and needing some help.
Has my wife medicated you?
Are you here for the procedure?
Don't you die on me, Violet!
No.
Don't you die!
Don't you die on me.
Violet!
Stay with me.
It's okay.
Have you been doing the cognitive exercises we talked about?
Yes.
Nothing helps.
I can't take this anxiety.
The other night, I meet a girl.
Allyson-- works in accounting.
There's a real chemistry there.
Derek, that's great.
Ask her out.
Get out of your own head.
I...
I would love to.
But what happens if she wants to come home with me some night?
How... how do I explain why all the mirrors are covered up?
Derek, you're doing this to yourself.
Think of it as the psychological law of physics.
The more you fear something, the more power you give it.
You need to conquer this thing, Derek.
You're going to go home, you're going to look in the mirror, and you're going to say those words.
They're not magic words.
There is no Piggy Man.

Will you please just let me talk to him?
Tate!

No, please.
He'll go peacefully.
He's just a child!
He's just a child!
Please don't hurt my son.
Why did you do it?

Because I care about your feelings more than mine.
I love you.
There, I said it-- not just on some chalkboard.
I would never let anybody or anything hurt you.
I've never felt that way about anyone.
Come here.
I'm tired.
Me too.
(doorbell ringing, knocking on door)
Does Tate Langdon live here?
He's my son.
Why?
What has he done?
All right, make entry.
(sirens wailing in distance)
Stop it.
Ah, okay.

What the hell, dude?
Somebody's shooting up the school.
He's shooting people.
Wait, are you hit?
Where are you hit?
Shit, I don't, I don't know, man.
That's not my blood.
I was right next to Mark Finstein, and the guy shot him in the freaking skull.
Who's doing this?
I-I don't know.
We need to get the hell out of here!

Go!
Go!

Mom?
Mom?
Mommy.
She's not here.
Where is she?
Did you hurt her?
(chuckles)
Of course not.
She's probably at the grocery store, buying some frozen fare to reheat for your supper tonight.
You found out about Tate, didn't you?
I knew you would.
Get out of my house!
This is not happening.
I questioned my sanity when I first found out..
But this house... this house will make you a believer.
You see, Violet, we were living here when Tate lost his way.
And I believe that the house drove him to it.
What?
No.
That can't be real.
You're a smart girl.
How can you be so arrogant to think that there's only one reality that you're able to see?
I want you to meet someone.
Violet Harmon, meet Billie Dean Howard.
The child has no manners.
Billie is a gifted medium.
She can help.
You're confused.
Overwhelmed.
Why wouldn't you be?
I never asked for any of this.
None of us did.
But nothing can be done once one's been chosen.
Billie has been helping me for years.
I first found her on Craigslist.
I've been through all the phonies, but she is 100% authentic.
I've just come from a meeting at Lifetime;
they're interested in making a pilot with me.
A Craigslist psychic with a Hollywood agent.
Who'd have thought?
A medium, dear.
I can't read your future.
That's a different gift.
Have some chamomile tea.
It'll calm the nerves.
I'm in a dream.
I used to be like you.
Until I was 25.
When out of the blue, my cleaning lady shows up as I'm brushing my teeth.
Except she's got no toilet brush and rubber gloves, she's naked and bloody.
Her husband murdered her with an ice pick.
It's hard to keep good help.
BILLIE:
Do you think I wanted a bloody Mexican ghost in my bathroom?
All I wanted was to improve my tennis game and unseat Charlotte Whitney as president of my book club.
But I was chosen.
And when you're chosen, you either get with the program or you go crazy.
Understanding the truth is your only choice.
What's your version of the truth?
There are some who have an understandably violent and vengeful reaction to being horribly murdered.
They refuse to move on, until they exact their pound of flesh.
Then there are a very few souls, like Tate, who don't even know they're dead, who walk among the living in child-like confusion.
That's why I wanted him to see your father.
I was hoping your father might help him achieve some clarity about himself so that he could see the truth on his own.
We must help him cross over, Violet.
This is bullshit.
I was set up.
My computer was-- someone messed with my...
Who is Mary?
VIVIEN:
Violet, she wants to talk to you.
(monitor beeping steadily)
I don't understand you.
Never will understand you.
Does that mean anything to you?
"They don't understand you?"
(sobs)
(door opens, closes)
Can I trust her?
I'm not sure.
(Bach's "Cello Suite No. 5 in C Minor" playing)
(screams)
(ring clinks on table)
(beeps)
Okay, so I've checked the perimeter of the property, the upstairs, the basement.
Everything's secure.
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just hearing things.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
Oh, no, it's not a waste of time.
Not at all.
That's what I'm here for.
Even if it's only for your peace of mind.
Thank you.
My husband just moved out recently, so...
He had an affair, and don't know why I'm telling you this.
Oh, no.
It's okay.
Actually, we get sensitivity training.
We deal with people's worst fears, real or imaginary.
That makes sense.
But, actually, with the, uh, with the infidelity,
I have firsthand experience with that.
Hmm.
Not me.
No, my wife.
With another man?
It was a woman.
Yeah, I know.
A lot of guys would be into that, right?
Me, not so much.
(door opens)
What happened now?
I thought I heard somebody.
Where?
Outside or inside?
Outside.
I looked around, checked the alarm system.
Everything seems to be working fine.
Thanks for filling in.
Oh, by the way, the woman that I took out of here?
She never made it to the police station.
What?
I don't understand.
She must have hopped out of my vehicle at a stop sign or something.
Please keep you alarm on even when you're home.
Thank you.
(door opens, closes)
What are you doing here?
I've got to work, Vivien.
Rent an office.
We don't the have the money, Viv!
I promise I'll leave right after my last patient.
I don't want you here.
You brought this on yourself.
(sighs) You're right.
And you're angry.
If you violated our marriage right in front of me, I'd be furious.
But I need a place to work, Vivien.
We need the money.
I'm finding it really hard to look at your face.
'Cause I really, really, really want to bash it in.
I find you disgusting... and disappointing as a man.
And we're gonna end this marriage and we're gonna sell this house and I'll let you be a father to our kids because I happen to think that you're a good one.
But I'm not gonna be your friend.
I will merely tolerate you.
And you can see your patients in the house, but I want you to leave after your last session of the day.
♪ ♪
Are you scared now?
BEN:
Urban legends?
Urban legends, they, they terrify me.
Lately, it's gotten so bad I can't even function.
When you say "urban legends..."
All of 'em:
Bloody Mary, Candy Man,
Lady in White.
Children's ghost stories.
When I was younger, my brothers would tell them to me.
Hold me down, force me to listen to 'em.
Older brothers can be mean.
They were younger.
I see.
Nothing else scares me:
terrorism, disease, violent crime, crashing economy.
Just these stories that I know are utter bullshit.
I'm paralyzed, Doctor.
I can't maintain a relationship.
What girl wants to screw a grown man who has to sleep with his lights on?
Speaking of sleep, I can't.
I don't.
I binge eat.
I smoke like a fish.
Lately, it's gotten a lot worse.
I must look terrible.
I haven't had the courage to look in a mirror in the last week.
Why's that?
Piggy Man.
Piggy Man?
I don't think I heard that one before.
Oh, God.
It's, uh, it's terrifying.
Okay, story goes, um... he was a hog butcher in Chicago during the World's Fair of 1893.
And before he would go into the slaughter pen, he would put on this mask, this pig mask that he'd made from one of his other kills, and he would snort-- (snorts) you know, like a pig--
make 'em think he was one of them.
Then one day, he slipped and he fell.
The pigs, hogs tore him apart.
And they didn't find one piece of him anywhere.
So everyone assumed.
'Cause not too long after, his former customers, they started turning up dead;
gutted, skinned and hung upside down in the bathtub to drain, like a hog in his shop.
And they say if you stand in front of a mirror and say...
Here, piggy pig-pig.
"Here, piggy pig-pig,"
that he'll return for the slaughter.
And have you tried that?
Here, piggy pig... (squealing)
No.
But there's something inside of me that's afraid that I might.
And that scares the hell out of me.
We're gonna get to the root of what that is, I promise you.
Okay.
I want to see you again Wednesday, 3:00, all right?
Sure.
In the meantime, I want you to shave.
In a mirror?
Can you try, Derek?
Yeah.
Good.
Call me if you need me.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Dad?
Hey, honey.
I'm sorry, Daddy.
It's all my fault.
What?
No.
No, baby.
No, no, no.
Your mom and I both love you very much.
It's never gonna change.
It's the darkness.
It has me.
I have you.
Baby, I have you.
I have you.
She's a nurse in your department.
I think her name is Angie something?
She fainted during an ultrasound.
Right.
She's an ultrasound technician.
So she quit?
Would you ask her to call me, then?
Vivien Harmon.
Okay, thank, thank you.
Hi, Constance.
I'm so sorry about Adelaide.
I've been meaning to make a condolence call, and I've just been...
Moira tells me that you've been suffering terribly.
That every time you leave the house, you're racked with violent morning sickness?
Yeah.
Well, you know, my mother always recommended a big platter of offal during the first trimester of pregnancy.
She preferred pork.
Oh, well, how nice of you to think of me during this...
I believe life is for the living, don't you?
Sweetbreads.
Now these two are thymus glands, one from the heart, one from the throat.
And this is the pancreas.
It's so good for mother and child.
Full of protein, vitamin C, all the B vitamins and iron.
And speaking of which... how is your other baby?
She was such a dear sweet child, and such a comfort to me when Addie passed.
Well, she's been very upset.
Spending a lot of time in her room.
Sometimes, children going through transition just need alone time.
Well, I, um, can't thank you enough for the offal.
Offal.
Moira, why don't you sauté these for Mrs. Harmon's lunch?
Do 'em the way that you used to do them for me, remember?
With sweet butter.
I'd be happy to do that for Mrs. Harmon.
(chuckles) We need that baby.
We need another... sweet child around here.
May I say something that could be considered out of turn, but that is sincerely heartfelt?
I guess so.
Cheating on one's pregnant wife qualifies as an unspeakable criminal act.
It's on a par with murder.
And I'll tell you one thing I know, if I know anything at all--
Dr. Harmon will cheat again, if given half the chance.
I hope I haven't upset you, speaking my mind so directly.
Just a pinch of the sea salt, a tiny squeeze of the lemon, if you like.
Although I prefer without.
And ma'am,
I've left the pancreas uncooked.
They say it's the tenderest organ of them all, especially when eaten raw.
Oh...
Uh, no,
I don't think so, Moira.
Think of the baby.
Mmm.
Mmm.
DEREK:
I don't think I can do this.
Have you been doing the exercises we talked about-- looking in the bathroom mirror at home?
Yeah, but I cheated.
I used my toaster-- it has a very reflective surface.
(chuckles) Okay, well, that's a start.
You're in my house now.
And you're safe.
You're safe.
I'm going to stand right outside this door.
I can't do it.
Here.
Use this.
But only if you have to.
Breathe...
I'm going to turn off the light.
I'm going to close the door, and I'll be right outside.
Breathe, just breathe.
That's it.
Turning off the light.
(whimpering)
And I'm going to shut the door.
(gasping, hyperventilating)
Think I'm having a heart attack!
I'm right here, Derek.
Five feet away.
Just say the words.
Nothing's going to happen.
Here, piggy, pig-pig.
(gasping):
Here... piggy... pig.
(screaming)
Derek!
Derek, it's okay.
It's okay.
There's-there's something in there!
It's okay.
It's okay.

There's no one in there.
You see?

It's never going to stop.
I'm broken!
No, no, no, no...
I didn't get to the last pig.
Over 5,000 amnios, and not a single miscarriage, but who's counting?
And so this would-- with the Down syndrome...?
Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida.
The amnio results should put your mind at ease.
Sorry I'm late.
Traffic was insane.
You didn't have to leave work to come here.
Of course he should.
He's the daddy.
That's right, I'm the daddy.
We have to be nice to Mommy today.
And keep her off her feet.
Will do.
Regina is going to find the perfect spot so we don't hurt the baby.
Right there.
You're going to feel a tiny pinch.
I owe you an apology.
It attacked you too, didn't it?
No.
But I don't know what's real anymore.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
The Devil is real.
And he's not a little red man with horns and a tail.
He can be beautiful.
Because he's a fallen angel, and he used to be God's favorite.
Have you read the Book of Revelation?
No.
In Heaven, there's this woman in labor howling in pain.
And there's a red dragon with seven heads waiting so he can eat her baby.
But the Archangel Michael, he hurls the dragon down to earth.
From that moment on, the red dragon hates the woman, and declares war on her and all of her children.
That's us.
Oh, yeah, things have gotten pretty weird for me.
Me, too.
I can't eat, I can't sleep.
The nights are the worst.
I get four hours, if I'm lucky.
That's only with pills.
What kind of pills?
Can I have one?
They were over by the sofa.
Used to be a row of tables.
I get four or five of you sickos a year.
Usually freshmen.
What, are you a transfer?
You're that teacher.
You're like a hero.
Now you know what heroes look like.
Wait, I'm sorry.
I'm not like those other kids.
I know Tate.
I mean, I know his mom.
We moved next door to her.
Did you know him?
Before he did this?
I knew his face.
Didn't seem like a bad kid, actually.
He was in here a lot.
Kind of thoughtful, liked to read.
Byron, books on birds, random stuff.
Was he bullied or something?
Did he even know the kids he shot?
I just want to know why he did it.
Me, too.
Why are you bullshitting me?
!
If the bullet had been an inch to the right, it would've missed my spine and I would have walked out of here.
Might have even been able to stop him.
An inch higher, it would have killed me.
Sometimes shit just happens.
Good people don't just have a bad day and start shooting people.
Maybe he wasn't a good person.
Moira.
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.
You've lost the baby.
No, no, no, no.
Oh.
Stop.
Stop cleaning and come sit down.
Have a seat.
I'm afraid we're going to have to let you go.
I don't understand.
The house is spotless.
It has nothing to do with you, believe me.
Mrs. Harmon, this is not a job.
For me, coming here is a reprieve.
I understand.
We just can't afford it.
Then I'll work for free, till you sell.
I'll make the house gleam and glitter for the new owners.
Then, perhaps, they'll hire me.
Mrs. Harmon, I've had my share of regrets.
But leaving an expectant mother in the time of her need will not be one of them.
I'm staying.
(laughing)
You're being so dramatic.
I'm not helpless, Moira.
Well, I'm not one to belabor a point, but where has the time gone?
You must be famished.
I mean, I am hungry.
Constance dropped by earlier with another delicious delicacy.
No.
I don't want you cooking for me.
Please, don't go to the trouble.
Come on.
No trouble at all.
It's served raw.
So you and the baby get the full measure of vitamins.
It's the most nutritious organ of them all.
It came from an organic farm.
I hear the raw food movement is really taking off.
For the baby.

I don't understand you.
Never will understand you.
Does that mean anything to you?
"They don't understand you?"
Can I trust her?
I'm not sure.
Okay, so I've checked the perimeter of the property, the upstairs, the basement.
Everything's secure.
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just hearing things.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
Oh, no, it's not a waste of time.
Not at all.
That's what I'm here for.
Even if it's only for your peace of mind.
Thank you.
My husband just moved out recently, so...
He had an affair, and don't know why I'm telling you this.
Oh, no.
It's okay.
Actually, we get sensitivity training.
We deal with people's worst fears, real or imaginary.
That makes sense.
But, actually, with the, uh, with the infidelity,
I have firsthand experience with that.
Hmm.
Not me.
No, my wife.
With another man?
It was a woman.
Yeah, I know.
A lot of guys would be into that, right?
Me, not so much.
What happened now?
I thought I heard somebody.
Where?
Outside or inside?
Outside.
I looked around, checked the alarm system.
Everything seems to be working fine.
Thanks for filling in.
Oh, by the way, the woman that I took out of here?
She never made it to the police station.
What?
I don't understand.
She must have hopped out of my vehicle at a stop sign or something.
Please keep you alarm on even when you're home.
Thank you.
What are you doing here?
I've got to work, Vivien.
Rent an office.
We don't the have the money, Viv!
I promise I'll leave right after my last patient.
I don't want you here.
You brought this on yourself.
You're right.
And you're angry.
If you violated our marriage right in front of me, I'd be furious.
But I need a place to work, Vivien.
We need the money.
I'm finding it really hard to look at your face.
'Cause I really, really, really want to bash it in.
I find you disgusting... and disappointing as a man.
And we're gonna end this marriage and we're gonna sell this house and I'll let you be a father to our kids because I happen to think that you're a good one.
But I'm not gonna be your friend.
I will merely tolerate you.
And you can see your patients in the house, but I want you to leave after your last session of the day.
Are you scared now?
Urban legends?
Urban legends, they, they terrify me.
Lately, it's gotten so bad I can't even function.
When you say "urban legends..."
Bloody Mary, Candy Man,
Lady in White.
Children's ghost stories.
When I was younger, my brothers would tell them to me.
Hold me down, force me to listen to 'em.
Older brothers can be mean.
They were younger.
I see.
Nothing else scares me:
terrorism, disease, violent crime, crashing economy.
Just these stories that I know are utter bullshit.
I'm paralyzed, Doctor.
I can't maintain a relationship.
What girl wants to screw a grown man who has to sleep with his lights on?
Speaking of sleep, I can't.
I don't.
I binge eat.
I smoke like a fish.
Lately, it's gotten a lot worse.
I must look terrible.
I haven't had the courage to look in a mirror in the last week.
Why's that?
Piggy Man.
Piggy Man?
I don't think I heard that one before.
Oh, God.
It's, uh, it's terrifying.
Okay, story goes, um... he was a hog butcher in Chicago during the World's Fair of 1893.
And before he would go into the slaughter pen, he would put on this mask, this pig mask that he'd made from one of his other kills, and he would snort-- you know, like a pig--
make 'em think he was one of them.
Then one day, he slipped and he fell.
The pigs, hogs tore him apart.
And they didn't find one piece of him anywhere.
So everyone assumed.
'Cause not too long after, his former customers, they started turning up dead;
gutted, skinned and hung upside down in the bathtub to drain, like a hog in his shop.
And they say if you stand in front of a mirror and say...
Here, piggy pig-pig.
"Here, piggy pig-pig,"
that he'll return for the slaughter.
And have you tried that?
Here, piggy pig...
No.
But there's something inside of me that's afraid that I might.
And that scares the hell out of me.
We're gonna get to the root of what that is, I promise you.
Okay.
I want to see you again Wednesday, 3:00, all right?
Sure.
In the meantime, I want you to shave.
In a mirror?
Can you try, Derek?
Yeah.
Good.
Call me if you need me.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Dad?
Hey, honey.
I'm sorry, Daddy.
It's all my fault.
What?
No.
No, baby.
No, no, no.
Your mom and I both love you very much.
It's never gonna change.
It's the darkness.
It has me.
I have you.
Baby, I have you.
I have you.
She's a nurse in your department.
I think her name is Angie something?
She fainted during an ultrasound.
Right.
She's an ultrasound technician.
So she quit?
Would you ask her to call me, then?
Vivien Harmon.
Okay, thank, thank you.
Hi, Constance.
I'm so sorry about Adelaide.
I've been meaning to make a condolence call, and I've just been...
Moira tells me that you've been suffering terribly.
That every time you leave the house, you're racked with violent morning sickness?
Yeah.
Well, you know, my mother always recommended a big platter of offal during the first trimester of pregnancy.
She preferred pork.
Oh, well, how nice of you to think of me during this...
I believe life is for the living, don't you?
Sweetbreads.
Now these two are thymus glands, one from the heart, one from the throat.
And this is the pancreas.
It's so good for mother and child.
Full of protein, vitamin C, all the B vitamins and iron.
And speaking of which... how is your other baby?
She was such a dear sweet child, and such a comfort to me when Addie passed.
Well, she's been very upset.
Spending a lot of time in her room.
Sometimes, children going through transition just need alone time.
Well, I, um, can't thank you enough for the offal.
Offal.
Moira, why don't you sauté these for Mrs. Harmon's lunch?
Do 'em the way that you used to do them for me, remember?
With sweet butter.
I'd be happy to do that for Mrs. Harmon.
We need that baby.
We need another... sweet child around here.
May I say something that could be considered out of turn, but that is sincerely heartfelt?
I guess so.
Cheating on one's pregnant wife qualifies as an unspeakable criminal act.
It's on a par with murder.
And I'll tell you one thing I know, if I know anything at all--
Dr. Harmon will cheat again, if given half the chance.
I hope I haven't upset you, speaking my mind so directly.
Just a pinch of the sea salt, a tiny squeeze of the lemon, if you like.
Although I prefer without.
And ma'am,
I've left the pancreas uncooked.
They say it's the tenderest organ of them all, especially when eaten raw.
Oh...
Uh, no,
I don't think so, Moira.
Think of the baby.
Mmm.
Mmm.
I don't think I can do this.
Have you been doing the exercises we talked about-- looking in the bathroom mirror at home?
Yeah, but I cheated.
I used my toaster-- it has a very reflective surface.
Okay, well, that's a start.
You're in my house now.
And you're safe.
You're safe.
I'm going to stand right outside this door.
I can't do it.
Here.
Use this.
But only if you have to.
Breathe...
I'm going to turn off the light.
I'm going to close the door, and I'll be right outside.
Breathe, just breathe.
That's it.
Turning off the light.
And I'm going to shut the door.
Think I'm having a heart attack!
I'm right here, Derek.
Five feet away.
Just say the words.
Nothing's going to happen.
Here, piggy, pig-pig.
Here... piggy... pig.
Derek!
Derek, it's okay.
It's okay.
There's-there's something in there!
It's okay.
It's okay.
There's no one in there.
You see?
It's never going to stop.
I'm broken!
No, no, no, no...
I didn't get to the last pig.
Over 5,000 amnios, and not a single miscarriage, but who's counting?
And so this would-- with the Down syndrome...?
Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida.
The amnio results should put your mind at ease.
Sorry I'm late.
Traffic was insane.
You didn't have to leave work to come here.
Of course he should.
He's the daddy.
That's right, I'm the daddy.
We have to be nice to Mommy today.
And keep her off her feet.
Will do.
Regina is going to find the perfect spot so we don't hurt the baby.
Right there.
You're going to feel a tiny pinch.
I owe you an apology.
It attacked you too, didn't it?
No.
But I don't know what's real anymore.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
The Devil is real.
And he's not a little red man with horns and a tail.
He can be beautiful.
Because he's a fallen angel, and he used to be God's favorite.
Have you read the Book of Revelation?
No.
In Heaven, there's this woman in labor howling in pain.
And there's a red dragon with seven heads waiting so he can eat her baby.
But the Archangel Michael, he hurls the dragon down to earth.
From that moment on, the red dragon hates the woman, and declares war on her and all of her children.
That's us.
Oh, yeah, things have gotten pretty weird for me.
Me, too.
I can't eat, I can't sleep.
The nights are the worst.
I get four hours, if I'm lucky.
That's only with pills.
What kind of pills?
Can I have one?
They were over by the sofa.
Used to be a row of tables.
I get four or five of you sickos a year.
Usually freshmen.
What, are you a transfer?
You're that teacher.
You're like a hero.
Now you know what heroes look like.
Wait, I'm sorry.
I'm not like those other kids.
I know Tate.
I mean, I know his mom.
We moved next door to her.
Did you know him?
Before he did this?
I knew his face.
Didn't seem like a bad kid, actually.
He was in here a lot.
Kind of thoughtful, liked to read.
Byron, books on birds, random stuff.
Was he bullied or something?
Did he even know the kids he shot?
I just want to know why he did it.
Me, too.
Why are you bullshitting me?
!
If the bullet had been an inch to the right, it would've missed my spine and I would have walked out of here.
Might have even been able to stop him.
An inch higher, it would have killed me.
Sometimes shit just happens.
Good people don't just have a bad day and start shooting people.
Maybe he wasn't a good person.
Moira.
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.
You've lost the baby.
No, no, no, no.
Oh.
Stop.
Stop cleaning and come sit down.
Have a seat.
I'm afraid we're going to have to let you go.
I don't understand.
The house is spotless.
It has nothing to do with you, believe me.
Mrs. Harmon, this is not a job.
For me, coming here is a reprieve.
I understand.
We just can't afford it.
Then I'll work for free, till you sell.
I'll make the house gleam and glitter for the new owners.
Then, perhaps, they'll hire me.
Mrs. Harmon, I've had my share of regrets.
But leaving an expectant mother in the time of her need will not be one of them.
I'm staying.
You're being so dramatic.
I'm not helpless, Moira.
Well, I'm not one to belabor a point, but where has the time gone?
You must be famished.
I mean, I am hungry.
Constance dropped by earlier with another delicious delicacy.
No.
I don't want you cooking for me.
Please, don't go to the trouble.
Come on.
No trouble at all.
It's served raw.
So you and the baby get the full measure of vitamins.
It's the most nutritious organ of them all.
It came from an organic farm.
I hear the raw food movement is really taking off.
For the baby.
Tate?
Tate?
I'm not playing hide-and-seek, Tate.
You have to leave now!
Get out of my house!
Look at what he did to me.
Excuse me, ma'am, I don't want to bother you, but I'm hurt and needing some help.
Has my wife medicated you?
Are you here for the procedure?
Don't you die on me, Violet!
No.
Don't you die!
Don't you die on me.
Violet!
Stay with me.
It's okay.
Have you been doing the cognitive exercises we talked about?
Yes.
Nothing helps.
I can't take this anxiety.
The other night, I meet a girl.
Allyson-- works in accounting.
There's a real chemistry there.
Derek, that's great.
Ask her out.
Get out of your own head.
I...
I would love to.
But what happens if she wants to come home with me some night?
How... how do I explain why all the mirrors are covered up?
Derek, you're doing this to yourself.
Think of it as the psychological law of physics.
The more you fear something, the more power you give it.
You need to conquer this thing, Derek.
You're going to go home, you're going to look in the mirror, and you're going to say those words.
They're not magic words.
There is no Piggy Man.
Once you face that, you can finally start to deal with the real issues in your life.
I mean, you're absolutely right.
I want to do it.
I can do it.
The moment you do... you'll be free.
Angela?
Vivien.
Thank you so much for agreeing to meet with me.
Of course.
That's, uh, probably close enough.
When you gave me the address,
I didn't realize it was a church.
It's where I feel safe.
The hospital said you quit your job, but they didn't say why.
I've been concerned because of the ultrasound and...
They said that the machine malfunctioned, but... it seemed to me that you saw something that scared you.
Yes, and I've been praying about it ever since.
I saw the unclean thing, what you carry in your womb.
The plague of nations, the Beast.
Okay, so you didn't see anything.
So... the machine malfunctioned.
It did not.
I saw the little hooves.
You need some help.
"And the woman was full of the filthiness of her fornication!
"The mother of harlots and abominations of the Earth!"
Here, piggy, piggy, pig.
Here, piggy, piggy, pig.
Pig.
Here, piggy, piggy, pig.
Who you calling a pig?
What the hell did you do?
This was supposed to be a robbery.
Now it's murder, you asshole.
Called me a pig.
We got to get out of here.
I am beginning to think you're a fraud.
And that nail polish is vulgar.
Don't take it out on me just because your dead daughter is mad at you.
Now, why the hell would you say that to me?
Because you're capable of handling the truth.
I see it all the time.
The dead can hold a grudge better than most Scorpios.
I want to talk to her, Billie.
I have one last thing... that I have to say to her.
I just miss her so terribly.
She was my reason for living.
She says you should have told her that when she was alive.
She's a feisty one.
Talk to her.
She's here.
Come on.
Baby...
I am so sorry.
I'm sorry because... most of the time that I was with you, especially when you were younger,
I was just so overwhelmed.
It wasn't easy being a single parent, and you were such a handful.
So I guess I forgot to say the things that I was supposed to say, but that I honestly always felt in my heart.
I am so proud of you, Addie.
I admire you so... for what you were able to overcome.
And I think you're beautiful.
Addie, I think you are the most beautiful girl...
I ever met.
She says thank you.
And that she knows.
And that where she is now, on the other side... she's a pretty girl at last.
She also wants you to know that she's grateful.
For not getting her to the lawn at the old house.
She doesn't want to be with Tate.
She's afraid of him now that she knows the truth.
Please don't hurt him!
Tate!
Tate!
Wait!
Let me just talk to him!
Will you please just let me talk to him?
Tate!
Tate!
No, please.
He'll go peacefully.
He's just a child!
He's just a child!
Please don't hurt my son.
Why did you do it?
I like birds, too.
Why do you like them?
'Cause they can fly away when things get too crazy, I guess.
Are you going to tell your parents?
About the pills?
No.
I've been sleeping a lot.
They think I'm depressed.
Are you?
I'm sad.
Me, too.
Violet.
Something has changed in you.
Toward me.
You're distant, cold.
I don't know what I've done, but I'll leave you alone from now on if that's what you want.
Is that what you want?
You know why I'd leave you alone?
Because I care about your feelings more than mine.
I love you.
There, I said it-- not just on some chalkboard.
I would never let anybody or anything hurt you.
I've never felt that way about anyone.
Come here.
I'm tired.
Me too.
- Does Tate Langdon live here?
- He's my son.
- Why?
What has he done?
- All right.
Make entry.
Stop it.
Ah, okay.
- What the hell, dude?
- Somebody's shooting up the school.
- He's just shooting people.
- Wait.
Are you hit?
- Where are you hit?
- Shit.
I don't
- I don't know, man.
That's not my blood.
I was right next to Mark Finstein... and the-the guy shot him in the freaking skull.
- Who's doing this?
- I don't know.
We need to get the hell out of here.
Go!
Go!
It's okay.
Block
- Block the door.
Get
- Get the door.
Oh!
Hey.
No, no.
Please, don't!
Get to the phone!
Screw this.
It's gonna be okay.
Yeah, everything is gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
Hey!
It's enough.
Get out of here.
Oh, God!
No!
Oh, God.
Please!
Why?
Why?
Please.
Please, don't hurt him.
Let me talk to him.
Please, just let me talk to him.
Tate!
Tate.
No, please.
He'll go peacefully.
He's just a child!
He's just a child!
Tate!
Tate!
No!
Mom?
Mom?
Mommy.
- She's not here.
- Where is she?
Did you hurt her?
Of course not.
She's probably at the grocery store... buying some frozen fare to reheat for your supper tonight.
You found out about Tate, didn't you?
- I knew you would.
- Get out of my house.
- This is not happening.
- I questioned my sanity when I first found out.
But this house- this house will make you a believer.
You see, Violet, we were living here... when Tate lost his way.
And I believe that the house drove him to it.
What?
No.
That can't be real.
You're a smart girl.
How can you be so arrogant... to think that there's only one reality that you're able to see?
I want you to meet someone.
Violet Harmon, meet Billie Dean Howard.
The child has no manners.
Billie is a gifted medium.
She can help.
You're confused.
Overwhelmed.
- Why wouldn't you be?
- I never asked for any of this.
None of us did.
But nothing can be done once one's been chosen.
Billie has been helping me for years.
I first found her on Craigslist.
I've been through all the phonies... but she is 100% authentic.
I've just come from a meeting at Lifetime.
They're interested in making a pilot with me.
A Craigslist psychic with a Hollywood agent.
Who'd have thought?
A medium, dear.
I can't read your future.
That's a different gift.
Have some chamomile tea.
It'll calm the nerves.
- I'm in a dream.
- I used to be like you.
Until I was 25... when out of the blue, my cleaning lady... shows up as I'm brushing my teeth.
Except she's got no toilet brush and rubber gloves.
She's naked and bloody.
- Her husband murdered her with an ice pick.
- It's hard to keep good help.
Do you think I wanted a bloody Mexican ghost in my bathroom?
All I wanted was to improve my tennis game... and unseat Charlotte Whitney as president of my book club.
But I was chosen.
And when you're chosen... you either get with the program, or you go crazy.
Understanding the truth is your only choice.
What's your version of the truth?
There are some who have an understandably violent... and vengeful reaction to being horribly murdered.
They refuse to move on... until they exact their pound of flesh.
Then there are a very few souls... like Tate... who don't even know they're dead... who walk among the living in childlike confusion.
That's why I wanted him to see your father.
I was hoping your father might help him achieve... some clarity about himself- that he could see the truth on his own.
We must help him cross over, Violet.
This is bullshit.
I was set up.
My computer was- Someone messed with my-
Who is Mary?
Violet, she wants to talk to you.
They don't understand you.
Never will understand you.
Does that mean anything to you?
"They don't understand you"?
Can I trust her?
I'm not sure.
Okay, so I've checked the perimeter of the property, the upstairs, the basement.
- Everything's secure.
- I don't know.
Maybe I'm just hearing things.
- I'm sorry I wasted your time.
- Oh, no, it's not a waste of time.
Not at all.
That's what I'm here for.
Even if it's only for your peace of mind.
Well, thank you.
My husband just moved out recently, so-
He had an affair and- Don't know why I'm telling you this.
Oh, no.
That's okay.
Yeah.
Actually, we get sensitivity training.
We deal with people's worst fears... real or imaginary.
That makes sense.
But, actually, with the, uh- with the infidelity?
- I have firsthand experience with that.
- Hmm.
Not me.
No.
My wife.
- With another man?
- It was a woman.
Yeah, I know.
Lot of guys would be into that, right?
Me, not so much.
- What happened now?
- I thought I heard somebody.
- Where?
Outside or inside?
- Outside.
I looked around, checked the alarm system.
Everything seems to be working fine.
Well, thanks for filling in.
Oh, by the way, the woman I took out of here?
She never made it to the police station.
What?
I don't understand.
She must have hopped out of my vehicle at a stop sign or something.
Please, keep your alarm on even when you're home.
- Thank you.
- All right.
- What are you doing here?
- I've gotta work, Vivien.
- Rent an office.
- We don't have the money, Viv.
I promise I'll leave... right after my last patient.
I don't want you here.
You brought this on yourself.
You're right.
And you're angry.
If you violated our marriage right in front of me, I'd be furious.
But I need a place to work, Vivien.
We need the money.
I'm finding it really hard to look at your face.
'Cause I really, really, really want to bash it in.
I find you disgusting... and disappointing as a man.
And we're gonna end this marriage... and we're gonna sell this house.
And I'll let you be a father to our kids... because I happen to think that you're a good one.
But I'm not gonna be your friend.
I will merely tolerate you.
And you can see your patients in the house... but I want you to leave after your last session of the day.
Are you scared now?
Urban legends?
Uh, urban legends- they, uh- they terrify me.
Lately it's gotten so bad I can't even function.
When you say urban legends-
All of them.
Uh, Bloody Mary, Candyman, Lady in White.
- Children's ghost stories.
- When I was younger... my brothers would tell them to me- hold me down, force me to listen to 'em.
Older brothers can be mean.
- They were younger.
- I see.
Nothing else scares me- terrorism, uh, disease... violent crime, crashing economy.
Just these stories that I know are utter bullshit.
I'm paralyzed, Doctor.
I can't maintain a relationship.
What girl wants to screw a grown man who has to sleep with his lights on?
Speaking of sleep, I can't.
I don't.
I binge eat.
I smoke like a fish.
Lately it's gotten a lot worse.
I must look terrible.
I haven't had the courage to look in a mirror in the last week.
Why is that?
Piggy Man.
Piggy Man?
I don't think I heard that one before.
Oh, God.
It's, uh
- It's terrifying.
Okay, story goes, um... he was a hog butcher in Chicago... during the World's Fair of 1893.
And before he would go into the slaughter pen... he would put on this mask- this pig mask- that he'd made from one of his other kills.
And he would snort- You know, like a pig.
Make 'em think he was one of them.
Then one day he slipped, and he fell.
The pigs, hogs, tore him apart.
And they didn't find one piece of him anywhere.
So everyone assumed.
Because not too long after, his former customers- they started turning up dead.
Gutted, skinned... and hung upside down in a bathtub to drain, like a hog in his shop.
And they say if you stand... in front of a mirror and say-
Here, piggy pig-pig.
"Here, piggy pig-pig"... that he'll return for the slaughter.
And have you tried that?
Here, piggy pig-
No.
But there's something inside of me... that's afraid that I might.
And that scares the hell out of me.
We're gonna get to the root of what that is.
I promise you.
Okay.
I want to see you again, uh...
Wednesday, 3:00, all right?
- Sure.
- In the meantime, I want you to shave.
- In a mirror?
- Can you try, Derek?
- Yeah.
- Good.
- Call me if you need me.
- Okay.
Thank you very much.
Dad.
Hey, honey.
I'm sorry, Daddy.
- It's all my fault.
- What?
No.
No, baby.
No, no, no.
Your mom and I both love you very much.
- It's never gonna change.
- It's the darkness.
- It has me.
- I have you.
Baby, I have you.
I have you.
She's a nurse in your department.
I think her name is Angie something.
She fainted during an ultrasound.
Right.
She's an ultrasound technician.
So she quit?
Would you ask her to call me then?
Vivien Harmon.
Okay.
Thank you.
Hi, Constance.
I'm so sorry about Adelaide.
I've been meaning to make a condolence call, and I've just been-
Moira tells me that you've been suffering terribly- that every time you leave the house you're racked with violent morning sickness?
Yeah.
Well, you know, my mother... always recommended a big platter of offal... during the first trimester of pregnancy.
She preferred pork.
Oh, well, how nice of you to think of me during this-
I believe life is for the living, don't you?
Sweetbreads.
Now these two are thymus glands- one from the heart, one from the throat.
And this is the pancreas.
It's so good for mother and child.
Full of protein, vitamin "C"... all the "B" vitamins and iron and-
Speaking of which... how is your other baby?
She was such a dear, sweet child... and such a comfort to me when Addy passed.
Well, she's been very upset.
Spending a lot of time in her room.
Sometimes children going through transition just need alone time.
Well, I, um... can't thank you enough for the "awful."
Offal.
Moira... why don't you sauté these for Mrs. Harmon's lunch?
Do 'em the way that you used to do them for me, remember?
With sweet butter.
I'd be happy to do that, for Mrs. Harmon.
We need that baby.
We need another... sweet child around here.
May I say something that could be considered out of turn...
- but that is sincerely heartfelt?
- I guess so.
Cheating on one's pregnant wife qualifies as an unspeakable criminal act.
It's on a par with murder.
And I'll tell you one thing I know, if I know anything at all.
Dr. Harmon will cheat again if given half the chance.
I hope I haven't upset you, speaking my mind so directly.
Just a pinch of the sea salt... a tiny squeeze of lemon if you like... although I prefer without.
And, ma'am, I've left the pancreas uncooked.
They say it's the tenderest organ of them all, especially when eaten raw.
Oh.
Uh, no, I don't think so, Moira.
Think of the baby.
Mmm.
Mmm.
I don't think I can do this.
Have you been doing the exercises we talked about?
Looking in the bathroom mirror at home?
Yeah, but I cheated.
I used my toaster.
It has a very reflective surface.
Okay.
Well, that's a start.
You're in my house now.
And you're safe.
You're safe.
I'm gonna stand right outside this door.
- I can't do it.
- Here.
Use this.
But only if you have to.
Breathe.
I'm gonna turn off the light.
I'm gonna close the door... and I'll be right outside.
Breathe.
Just breathe.
That's it.
Turning off the light.
And I'm gonna shut the door.
- I think I'm having a heart attack!
- I'm right here, Derek.
Five feet away.
Just say the words.
Nothing's gonna happen.
Here, piggy...
- pig-pig.
Here... piggy... pig-
Derek.
Derek, it's okay.
It's okay.
There's some- There's something in there!
It's okay.
It's all right.
There's no one in there.
You see?
It's never gonna stop.
- I'm broken!
- No, no, no, no.
I didn't even get to the last pig.
Over 5,000 amnios and not a single miscarriage, but who's counting?
And so this would- for the Down syndrome?
Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida.
The amnio results should put your mind at ease.
Sorry I'm late.
Traffic was insane.
You didn't have to leave work to come here.
- Of course he should.
He's the daddy.
- That's right.
I'm the daddy.
We have to be nice to Mommy today- and keep her off her feet.
Will do.
Regina is going to find the perfect spot, so we don't hurt the baby.
Right... there.
You're gonna feel a tiny pinch.
I owe you an apology.
- It attacked you too, didn't it?
- No.
But, I don't know what's real anymore.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
The devil is real.
And he's not a little red man with horns and a tail.
He can be beautiful.
'Cause he's a fallen angel, and he used to be God's favorite.
Have you read the Book of Revelation?
No.
In heaven... there's this woman in labor, howling in pain.
And there's a- there's a red dragon with seven heads waiting... so he can eat her baby.
But the archangel Michael- he hurls the dragon down to Earth.
From that moment on, the red dragon hates the woman... and declares war on her and all of her children.
That's us.
Uh, yeah, things have gotten pretty weird for me.
Me too.
I can't eat.
I can't sleep.
The nights are the worst.
I get... four hours if I'm lucky.
That's only with pills.
What kind of pills?
Can I have one?
They were over by the sofa.
Used to be a row of tables.
I get four or five of you sickos a year.
Usually freshmen.
What, are you a transfer?
You're that teacher.
- You're like a hero.
- Now you know what heroes look like.
Wait.
I'm sorry.
I'm not like those other kids.
I know Tate.
I mean, I know his mom.
We moved next door to her.
Did you know him?
Before he did this?
I knew his face.
Didn't seem like a bad kid actually.
He was in here a lot.
Kind of thoughtful.
Liked to read.
Byron, books on birds, random stuff.
Was he bullied or something?
Did he even know the kids he shot?
- I just want to know why he did it.
- Me too.
Why are you bullshitting me?
If the bullet had been an inch to the right... it would have missed my spine, and I would have walked out of here.
Might have even been able to stop him.
An inch higher, it would have killed me.
Sometimes... shit just happens.
Good people don't just have a bad day and start shooting people.
Maybe he wasn't a good person.
Moira.
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.
- You've lost the baby.
- No.
No, no, no.
Stop
- Stop cleaning and come sit down.
Come sit.
I'm afraid that we're gonna have to let you go.
I don't understand.
The house is spotless.
It has nothing to do with you, believe me.
Mrs. Harmon, this is not a job.
For me, coming here is a reprieve.
I understand.
We just can't afford it.
Then I'll work for free till you sell.
I'll make the house gleam and glitter for the new owners.
Then perhaps they'll hire me.
Mrs. Harmon, I've had my share of regrets.
But leaving an expectant mother in the time of her need will not be one of them.
I'm staying.
You're being so dramatic.
I'm not helpless, Moira.
Well, I'm not one to belabor a point, but where has the time gone?
- You must be famished.
- I mean, I am hungry.
Constance dropped by earlier with another delicious delicacy.
No.
I don't want you cooking for me.
Please, don't go to the trouble.
Come on.
No trouble at all.
It's served raw... so you and the baby get the full measure of vitamins.
It's the most nutritious organ of them all.
It came from an organic farm.
I hear the raw food movement is really taking off.
For the baby.
Tate?
Tate?
I'm not playing hide-and-seek, Tate.
You have to leave now!
Get out of my house!
Look at what he did to me.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I don't want to bother you, but I'm hurt and needing some help.
Has my wife medicated you?
Are you here for the procedure?
Don't you die on me, Violet!
No.
Don't you die!
Don't you die on me.
Violet!
Have you been doing the cognitive exercises we talked about?
Yes.
Nothing helps.
I can't take this anxiety.
The other night, I meet a girl- Allyson, works in accounting.
- There's a real chemistry there.
- Derek, that's great.
- Ask her out.
Get out of your own head.
- I
- I would love to.
But what happens if she wants to come home with me some night?
How do I explain why all the mirrors are covered up?
Derek, you're doing this to yourself.
Think of it as a psychological law of physics.
The more you fear something, the more power you give it.
You need to conquer this thing, Derek.
You're gonna go home.
You're gonna look in the mirror.
And you're gonna say those words.
They're not magic words.
There is no Piggy Man.
Once you face that, you can finally start to deal with the real issues in your life.
I mean, you're absolutely right.
I want to do it.
I can do it.
The moment you do... you'll be free.
Angela.
Vivien.
Thank you so much for agreeing to meet with me.
Of course.
That's, uh, probably close enough.
When you gave me the address, I didn't realize it was a church.
It's where I feel safe.
The hospital said you quit your job, but they didn't say why.
I've been concerned because of the ultrasound and-
They said that the machine malfunctioned, but... it seemed to me that you saw something that scared you.
Yes, and I've been praying about it ever since.
I saw the unclean thing, what you carry in your womb.
The plague of nations, the Beast.
Okay, so you didn't see anything.
So, the machine malfunctioned.
It did not.
I saw the little hooves.
You need some help.
And the woman was full of the filthiness of her fornication.
The mother of harlots and abominations of the Earth!
Here, piggy, piggy, pig.
Here... piggy, piggy, pig... pig.
Here, piggy, piggy, pig.
Who you calling a pig?
What the hell did you do?
This was supposed to be a robbery.
Now it's murder, you asshole.
- He called me a pig.
- We gotta get out of here.
I am beginning to think you're a fraud.
And that nail polish is vulgar.
Don't take it out on me just because your dead daughter is mad at you.
Now why the hell would you say that to me?
Because you're capable of handling the truth.
I see it all the time.
The dead can hold a grudge better than most Scorpios.
I want to talk to her, Billie.
I have one last thing... that I have to say to her.
I just miss her so terribly.
She was my reason for living.
She says you should have told her that when she was alive.
She's a feisty one.
Talk to her.
She's here.
Come on.
Baby...
I am so sorry.
I'm sorry because... most of the time that I was with you... especially when you were younger...
I was just so overwhelmed.
It wasn't easy being a single parent... and you were such a handful.
So I guess I forgot to say the things that I was supposed to say... but that I honestly... always felt in my heart.
I am so proud of you, Addy.
I admire you so... for what you were able to overcome.
And I think you're beautiful.
Addy, I think you are... the most beautiful girl...
I ever met.
She says thank you.
And that she knows.
And that where she is now... on the other side... she's a pretty girl at last.
She also wants you to know that she's grateful... for not getting her to the lawn at the old house.
She doesn't want to be with Tate.
She's afraid of him, now that she knows the truth.
Please don't hurt him!
Tate!
Tate!
Wait!
Let me just talk to him!
Will you please just let me talk to him?
Tate!
Tate!
No, please.
He'll go peacefully.
He's just a child!
He's just a child!
Why did you do it?
I like birds too.
Why do you like them?
'Cause they can fly away when things get too crazy, I guess.
Are you gonna tell your parents?
About the pills?
No.
I've been sleeping a lot.
They think I'm depressed.
- Are you?
- I'm sad.
Me too.
Violet.
Something has changed in you.
Toward me.
You're distant, cold.
I don't know what I've done... but I'll leave you alone from now on if that's what you want.
Is that what you want?
You know why I'd leave you alone?
'Cause I care about your feelings more than mine.
I love you.
There, I said it.
Not just on some chalkboard.
I would never let anybody or anything hurt you.
I've never felt that way about anyone.
Come here.
I'm tired.
Me too.

Does Tate Langdon live here?
He's my son.
Why?
What has he done?
All right, make entry.
Stop it.
Ah, okay.
What the hell, dude?
Somebody's shooting up the school.
He's shooting people.
Wait, are you hit?
Where are you hit?
Shit, I don't, I don't know, man.
That's not my blood.
I was right next to Mark Finstein, and the guy shot him in the freaking skull.
Who's doing this?
I-I don't know.
We need to get the hell out of here!
Go!
Go!
Block the door!
Get the door!
Hey.
No, no.
Please, no!
Screw this.
It's going to be okay.
Ev-Everything is going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.
Hey!
It's enough.
Get out of here.
Oh, God!
Oh, God.
Please!
Why?
!
Why?
Please.
Let me just talk to him!
Please, just let me talk to him!
Tate!
Tate.
No, please.
He'll go peacefully.
He's just a child!
He's just a child!
Tate!
Tate!
Oh, God, please don't do this!
He's just a child!
Let me talk to him!
Mom?
Mom?
Mommy.
She's not here.
Where is she?
Did you hurt her?
Of course not.
She's probably at the grocery store, buying some frozen fare to reheat for your supper tonight.
You found out about Tate, didn't you?
I knew you would.
Get out of my house!
This is not happening.
I questioned my sanity when I first found out..
But this house... this house will make you a believer.
You see, Violet, we were living here when Tate lost his way.
And I believe that the house drove him to it.
What?
No.
That can't be real.
You're a smart girl.
How can you be so arrogant to think that there's only one reality that you're able to see?
I want you to meet someone.
Violet Harmon, meet Billie Dean Howard.
The child has no manners.
Billie is a gifted medium.
She can help.
You're confused.
Overwhelmed.
Why wouldn't you be?
I never asked for any of this.
None of us did.
But nothing can be done once one's been chosen.
Billie has been helping me for years.
I first found her on Craigslist.
I've been through all the phonies, but she is 100% authentic.
I've just come from a meeting at Lifetime;
they're interested in making a pilot with me.
A Craigslist psychic with a Hollywood agent.
Who'd have thought?
A medium, dear.
I can't read your future.
That's a different gift.
Have some chamomile tea.
It'll calm the nerves.
I'm in a dream.
I used to be like you.
Until I was 25.
When out of the blue, my cleaning lady shows up as I'm brushing my teeth.
Except she's got no toilet brush and rubber gloves, she's naked and bloody.
Her husband murdered her with an ice pick.
It's hard to keep good help.
Do you think I wanted a bloody Mexican ghost in my bathroom?
All I wanted was to improve my tennis game and unseat Charlotte Whitney as president of my book club.
But I was chosen.
And when you're chosen, you either get with the program or you go crazy.
Understanding the truth is your only choice.
What's your version of the truth?
There are some who have an understandably violent and vengeful reaction to being horribly murdered.
They refuse to move on, until they exact their pound of flesh.
Then there are a very few souls, like Tate, who don't even know they're dead, who walk among the living in child-like confusion.
That's why I wanted him to see your father.
I was hoping your father might help him achieve some clarity about himself so that he could see the truth on his own.
We must help him cross over, Violet.
This is bullshit.
I was set up.
My computer was-- someone messed with my...
Who is Mary?
Violet, she wants to talk to you.
I don't understand you.
Never will understand you.
Does that mean anything to you?
"They don't understand you?"
Can I trust her?
I'm not sure.
Okay, so I've checked the perimeter of the property, the upstairs, the basement.
Everything's secure.
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just hearing things.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
Oh, no, it's not a waste of time.
Not at all.
That's what I'm here for.
Even if it's only for your peace of mind.
Thank you.
My husband just moved out recently, so...
He had an affair, and don't know why I'm telling you this.
Oh, no.
It's okay.
Actually, we get sensitivity training.
We deal with people's worst fears, real or imaginary.
That makes sense.
But, actually, with the, uh, with the infidelity,
I have firsthand experience with that.
Hmm.
Not me.
No, my wife.
With another man?
It was a woman.
Yeah, I know.
A lot of guys would be into that, right?
Me, not so much.
What happened now?
I thought I heard somebody.
Where?
Outside or inside?
Outside.
I looked around, checked the alarm system.
Everything seems to be working fine.
Thanks for filling in.
Oh, by the way, the woman that I took out of here?
She never made it to the police station.
What?
I don't understand.
She must have hopped out of my vehicle at a stop sign or something.
Please keep you alarm on even when you're home.
Thank you.
What are you doing here?
I've got to work, Vivien.
Rent an office.
We don't the have the money, Viv!
I promise I'll leave right after my last patient.
I don't want you here.
You brought this on yourself.
You're right.
And you're angry.
If you violated our marriage right in front of me, I'd be furious.
But I need a place to work, Vivien.
We need the money.
I'm finding it really hard to look at your face.
'Cause I really, really, really want to bash it in.
I find you disgusting... and disappointing as a man.
And we're gonna end this marriage and we're gonna sell this house and I'll let you be a father to our kids because I happen to think that you're a good one.
But I'm not gonna be your friend.
I will merely tolerate you.
And you can see your patients in the house, but I want you to leave after your last session of the day.
Are you scared now?
Urban legends?
Urban legends, they, they terrify me.
Lately, it's gotten so bad I can't even function.
When you say "urban legends..."
Bloody Mary, Candy Man,
Lady in White.
Children's ghost stories.
When I was younger, my brothers would tell them to me.
Hold me down, force me to listen to 'em.
Older brothers can be mean.
They were younger.
I see.
Nothing else scares me:
terrorism, disease, violent crime, crashing economy.
Just these stories that I know are utter bullshit.
I'm paralyzed, Doctor.
I can't maintain a relationship.
What girl wants to screw a grown man who has to sleep with his lights on?
Speaking of sleep, I can't.
I don't.
I binge eat.
I smoke like a fish.
Lately, it's gotten a lot worse.
I must look terrible.
I haven't had the courage to look in a mirror in the last week.
Why's that?
Piggy Man.
Piggy Man?
I don't think I heard that one before.
Oh, God.
It's, uh, it's terrifying.
Okay, story goes, um... he was a hog butcher in Chicago during the World's Fair of 1893.
And before he would go into the slaughter pen, he would put on this mask, this pig mask that he'd made from one of his other kills, and he would snort-- you know, like a pig--
make 'em think he was one of them.
Then one day, he slipped and he fell.
The pigs, hogs tore him apart.
And they didn't find one piece of him anywhere.
So everyone assumed.
'Cause not too long after, his former customers, they started turning up dead;
gutted, skinned and hung upside down in the bathtub to drain, like a hog in his shop.
And they say if you stand in front of a mirror and say...
Here, piggy pig-pig.
"Here, piggy pig-pig,"
that he'll return for the slaughter.
And have you tried that?
Here, piggy pig...
No.
But there's something inside of me that's afraid that I might.
And that scares the hell out of me.
We're gonna get to the root of what that is, I promise you.
Okay.
I want to see you again Wednesday, 3:00, all right?
Sure.
In the meantime, I want you to shave.
In a mirror?
Can you try, Derek?
Yeah.
Good.
Call me if you need me.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Dad?
Hey, honey.
I'm sorry, Daddy.
It's all my fault.
What?
No.
No, baby.
No, no, no.
Your mom and I both love you very much.
It's never gonna change.
It's the darkness.
It has me.
I have you.
Baby, I have you.
I have you.
She's a nurse in your department.
I think her name is Angie something?
She fainted during an ultrasound.
Right.
She's an ultrasound technician.
So she quit?
Would you ask her to call me, then?
Vivien Harmon.
Okay, thank, thank you.
Hi, Constance.
I'm so sorry about Adelaide.
I've been meaning to make a condolence call, and I've just been...
Moira tells me that you've been suffering terribly.
That every time you leave the house, you're racked with violent morning sickness?
Yeah.
Well, you know, my mother always recommended a big platter of offal during the first trimester of pregnancy.
She preferred pork.
Oh, well, how nice of you to think of me during this...
I believe life is for the living, don't you?
Sweetbreads.
Now these two are thymus glands, one from the heart, one from the throat.
And this is the pancreas.
It's so good for mother and child.
Full of protein, vitamin C, all the B vitamins and iron.
And speaking of which... how is your other baby?
She was such a dear sweet child, and such a comfort to me when Addie passed.
Well, she's been very upset.
Spending a lot of time in her room.
Sometimes, children going through transition just need alone time.
Well, I, um, can't thank you enough for the offal.
Offal.
Moira, why don't you sauté these for Mrs. Harmon's lunch?
Do 'em the way that you used to do them for me, remember?
With sweet butter.
I'd be happy to do that for Mrs. Harmon.
We need that baby.
We need another... sweet child around here.
May I say something that could be considered out of turn, but that is sincerely heartfelt?
I guess so.
Cheating on one's pregnant wife qualifies as an unspeakable criminal act.
It's on a par with murder.
And I'll tell you one thing I know, if I know anything at all--
Dr. Harmon will cheat again, if given half the chance.
I hope I haven't upset you, speaking my mind so directly.
Just a pinch of the sea salt, a tiny squeeze of the lemon, if you like.
Although I prefer without.
And ma'am,
I've left the pancreas uncooked.
They say it's the tenderest organ of them all, especially when eaten raw.
Oh...
Uh, no,
I don't think so, Moira.
Think of the baby.
Mmm.
Mmm.
- I don't think
- I can do this.
Have you been doing the exercises we talked about-- looking in the bathroom mirror at home?
Yeah, but I cheated.
I used my toaster-- it has a very reflective surface.
Okay, well, that's a start.
You're in my house now.
And you're safe.
You're safe.
I'm going to stand right outside this door.
I can't do it.
Here.
Use this.
But only if you have to.
Breathe...
I'm going to turn off the light.
I'm going to close the door, and I'll be right outside.
Breathe, just breathe.
That's it.
Turning off the light.
And I'm going to shut the door.
Think I'm having a heart attack!
I'm right here, Derek.
Five feet away.
Just say the words.
Nothing's going to happen.
Here, piggy, pig-pig.
Here... piggy... pig.
Derek!
Derek, it's okay.
It's okay.
There's-there's something in there!
It's okay.
It's okay.
There's no one in there.
You see?
It's never going to stop.
I'm broken!
No, no, no, no...
I didn't get to the last pig.
Over 5,000 amnios, and not a single miscarriage, but who's counting?
And so this would-- with the Down syndrome...?
Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida.
The amnio results should put your mind at ease.
Sorry I'm late.
Traffic was insane.
You didn't have to leave work to come here.
Of course he should.
He's the daddy.
That's right, I'm the daddy.
We have to be nice to Mommy today.
And keep her off her feet.
Will do.
Regina is going to find the perfect spot so we don't hurt the baby.
Right there.
You're going to feel a tiny pinch.
I owe you an apology.
It attacked you too, didn't it?
No.
But I don't know what's real anymore.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
The Devil is real.
And he's not a little red man with horns and a tail.
He can be beautiful.
Because he's a fallen angel, and he used to be God's favorite.
Have you read the Book of Revelation?
No.
In Heaven, there's this woman in labor howling in pain.
And there's a red dragon with seven heads waiting so he can eat her baby.
But the Archangel Michael, he hurls the dragon down to earth.
From that moment on, the red dragon hates the woman, and declares war on her and all of her children.
That's us.
Oh, yeah, things have gotten pretty weird for me.
Me, too.
I can't eat, I can't sleep.
The nights are the worst.
I get four hours, if I'm lucky.
That's only with pills.
What kind of pills?
Can I have one?
They were over by the sofa.
Used to be a row of tables.
I get four or five of you sickos a year.
Usually freshmen.
What, are you a transfer?
You're that teacher.
You're like a hero.
Now you know what heroes look like.
Wait, I'm sorry.
I'm not like those other kids.
I know Tate.
I mean, I know his mom.
We moved next door to her.
Did you know him?
Before he did this?
I knew his face.
Didn't seem like a bad kid, actually.

Maybe he wasn't a good person.
Moira.
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.
You've lost the baby.
No, no, no, no.
Oh.
Stop.
Stop cleaning and come sit down.
Have a seat.
I'm afraid we're going to have to let you go.
I don't understand.
The house is spotless.
It has nothing to do with you, believe me.
Mrs. Harmon, this is not a job.
For me, coming here is a reprieve.
I understand.
We just can't afford it.
Then I'll work for free, till you sell.
I'll make the house gleam and glitter for the new owners.
Then, perhaps, they'll hire me.
Mrs. Harmon, I've had my share of regrets.
But leaving an expectant mother in the time of her need will not be one of them.
I'm staying.
You're being so dramatic.

Well, I'm not one to belabor a point, but where has the time gone?
You must be famished.
I mean, I am hungry.
Constance dropped by earlier with another delicious delicacy.
No.
I don't want you cooking for me.
Please, don't go to the trouble.
Come on.
No trouble at all.
It's served raw.
So you and the baby get the full measure of vitamins.
It's the most nutritious organ of them all.
It came from an organic farm.
I hear the raw food movement is really taking off.
For the baby.
Tate?
Tate?
I'm not playing hide-and-seek, Tate.
You have to leave now!
Get out of my house!
Look at what he did to me.
Excuse me, ma'am, I don't want to bother you, but I'm hurt and needing some help.
Has my wife medicated you?
Are you here for the procedure?
Don't you die on me, Violet!
No.
Don't you die!
Don't you die on me.
Violet!
Stay with me.
It's okay.
Have you been doing the cognitive exercises we talked about?
Yes.
Nothing helps.
I can't take this anxiety.
The other night, I meet a girl.
Allyson-- works in accounting.
There's a real chemistry there.
Derek, that's great.
Ask her out.
Get out of your own head.
I...
I would love to.
But what happens if she wants to come home with me some night?
How... how do I explain why all the mirrors are covered up?
Derek, you're doing this to yourself.
Think of it as the psychological law of physics.
The more you fear something, the more power you give it.
You need to conquer this thing, Derek.
You're going to go home, you're going to look in the mirror, and you're going to say those words.
They're not magic words.
There is no Piggy Man.
Once you face that, you can finally start to deal with the real issues in your life.
I mean, you're absolutely right.
I want to do it.
I can do it.
The moment you do... you'll be free.
Angela?
Vivien.
Thank you so much for agreeing to meet with me.
Of course.
That's, uh, probably close enough.
When you gave me the address,
I didn't realize it was a church.
It's where I feel safe.
The hospital said you quit your job, but they didn't say why.
I've been concerned because of the ultrasound and...
They said that the machine malfunctioned, but... it seemed to me that you saw something that scared you.
Yes, and I've been praying about it ever since.
I saw the unclean thing, what you carry in your womb.
The plague of nations, the Beast.
Okay, so you didn't see anything.
So... the machine malfunctioned.
It did not.
I saw the little hooves.
You need some help.
"And the woman was full of the filthiness of her fornication!
"The mother of harlots and abominations of the Earth!"
Here, piggy, piggy, pig.
Here, piggy, piggy, pig.
Pig.
Here, piggy, piggy, pig.
Who you calling a pig?
What the hell did you do?
This was supposed to be a robbery.
Now it's murder, you asshole.
Called me a pig.
We got to get out of here.
I am beginning to think you're a fraud.
And that nail polish is vulgar.
Don't take it out on me just because your dead daughter is mad at you.
Now, why the hell would you say that to me?
Because you're capable of handling the truth.
I see it all the time.
The dead can hold a grudge better than most Scorpios.
I want to talk to her, Billie.
I have one last thing... that I have to say to her.
I just miss her so terribly.
She was my reason for living.
She says you should have told her that when she was alive.
She's a feisty one.
Talk to her.
She's here.
Come on.
Baby...
I am so sorry.
I'm sorry because... most of the time that I was with you, especially when you were younger,
I was just so overwhelmed.
It wasn't easy being a single parent, and you were such a handful.
So I guess I forgot to say the things that I was supposed to say, but that I honestly always felt in my heart.
I am so proud of you, Addie.
I admire you so... for what you were able to overcome.
And I think you're beautiful.
Addie, I think you are the most beautiful girl...
I ever met.
She says thank you.
And that she knows.
And that where she is now, on the other side... she's a pretty girl at last.
She also wants you to know that she's grateful.
For not getting her to the lawn at the old house.
She doesn't want to be with Tate.
She's afraid of him now that she knows the truth.
Please don't hurt him!
Tate!
Tate!
Wait!
Let me just talk to him!
Will you please just let me talk to him?
Tate!
Tate!
No, please.
He'll go peacefully.
He's just a child!
He's just a child!
Please don't hurt my son.
Why did you do it?
I like birds, too.
Why do you like them?
'Cause they can fly away when things get too crazy, I guess.
Are you going to tell your parents?
About the pills?
No.
I've been sleeping a lot.
They think I'm depressed.
Are you?
I'm sad.
Me, too.
Violet.
Something has changed in you.
Toward me.
You're distant, cold.
I don't know what I've done, but I'll leave you alone from now on if that's what you want.
Is that what you want?
You know why I'd leave you alone?
Because I care about your feelings more than mine.
I love you.
There, I said it-- not just on some chalkboard.
I would never let anybody or anything hurt you.
I've never felt that way about anyone.
Come here.
I'm tired.
Me too.

You see, Violet, we were living here... when Tate lost his way.
And I believe that the house drove him to it.

Billie is a gifted medium.
She can help.
You're confused.

- Why wouldn't you be?
- I never asked for any of this.
None of us did.
But nothing can be done once one's been chosen.
Billie has been helping me for years.
I first found her on Craigslist.
I've been through all the phonies... but she is 100% authentic.
I've just come from a meeting at Lifetime.
They're interested in making a pilot with me.
A Craigslist psychic with a Hollywood agent.
Who'd have thought?
A medium, dear.
I can't read your future.
That's a different gift.
Have some chamomile tea.
It'll calm the nerves.
- I'm in a dream.
- I used to be like you.
Until I was 25... when out of the blue, my cleaning lady... shows up as I'm brushing my teeth.
Except she's got no toilet brush and rubber gloves.
She's naked and bloody.
- Her husband murdered her with an ice pick.
- It's hard to keep good help.
Do you think I wanted a bloody Mexican ghost in my bathroom?
All I wanted was to improve my tennis game... and unseat Charlotte Whitney as president of my book club.
But I was chosen.
And when you're chosen... you either get with the program, or you go crazy.
Understanding the truth is your only choice.
What's your version of the truth?
There are some who have an understandably violent... and vengeful reaction to being horribly murdered.
They refuse to move on... until they exact their pound of flesh.
Then there are a very few souls... like Tate... who don't even know they're dead... who walk among the living in childlike confusion.
That's why I wanted him to see your father.
I was hoping your father might help him achieve... some clarity about himself- that he could see the truth on his own.
We must help him cross over, Violet.
This is bullshit.

Oh, God.

- It's terrifying.
Okay, story goes, um... he was a hog butcher in Chicago... during the World's Fair of 1893.
And before he would go into the slaughter pen... he would put on this mask- this pig mask- that he'd made from one of his other kills.
And he would snort- [ Snorts ] You know, like a pig.
Make 'em think he was one of them.
Then one day he slipped, and he fell.
The pigs, hogs, tore him apart.
And they didn't find one piece of him anywhere.
So everyone assumed.
Because not too long after, his former customers- they started turning up dead.
Gutted, skinned... and hung upside down in a bathtub to drain, like a hog in his shop.
And they say if you stand... in front of a mirror and say-
Here, piggy pig-pig.
"Here, piggy pig-pig"... that he'll return for the slaughter.
And have you tried that?

Moira tells me that you've been suffering terribly- that every time you leave the house you're racked with violent morning sickness?
Yeah.
Well, you know, my mother... always recommended a big platter of offal... during the first trimester of pregnancy.
She preferred pork.
Oh, well, how nice of you to think of me during this-
[ Chuckles ] I believe life is for the living, don't you?
Sweetbreads.
Now these two are thymus glands- one from the heart, one from the throat.
And this is the pancreas.
It's so good for mother and child.
Full of protein, vitamin "C"... all the "B" vitamins and iron and-
Speaking of which... how is your other baby?
She was such a dear, sweet child... and such a comfort to me when Addy passed.
Well, she's been very upset.
Spending a lot of time in her room.
Sometimes children going through transition just need alone time.
Well, I, um... can't thank you enough for the "awful."
Offal.
Moira... why don't you sauté these for Mrs. Harmon's lunch?
Do 'em the way that you used to do them for me, remember?
With sweet butter.
- I'd be happy to do that, for Mrs. Harmon.
- [ Chuckles ]

We need another... sweet child around here.

May I say something that could be considered out of turn...
- but that is sincerely heartfelt?
- I guess so.
Cheating on one's pregnant wife qualifies as an unspeakable criminal act.
It's on a par with murder.
And I'll tell you one thing I know, if I know anything at all.
Dr. Harmon will cheat again if given half the chance.
I hope I haven't upset you, speaking my mind so directly.
Just a pinch of the sea salt... a tiny squeeze of lemon if you like... although I prefer without.
And, ma'am, I've left the pancreas uncooked.
They say it's the tenderest organ of them all, especially when eaten raw.
Oh.
Uh, no, I don't think so, Moira.

Mmm.

Was he bullied or something?
Did he even know the kids he shot?
- I just want to know why he did it.
- Me too.
Why are you bullshitting me?
If the bullet had been an inch to the right... it would have missed my spine, and I would have walked out of here.
Might have even been able to stop him.

- We gotta get out of here.
- [ Chuckling ] - [ Scoffs ] I am beginning to think you're a fraud.
And that nail polish is vulgar.
Don't take it out on me just because your dead daughter is mad at you.
Now why the hell would you say that to me?
Because you're capable of handling the truth.
I see it all the time.
The dead can hold a grudge better than most Scorpios.
I want to talk to her, Billie.
I have one last thing... that I have to say to her.
I just miss her so terribly.
She was my reason for living.
She says you should have told her that when she was alive.
- She's a feisty one.
- [ Chuckles ]
Talk to her.
She's here.
Come on.
[ Inhales, Exhales Deeply]
[ Chuckles ]
Baby...
I am so sorry.
I'm sorry because... most of the time that I was with you... especially when you were younger...
I was just so overwhelmed.
It wasn't easy being a single parent... and you were such a handful.
So I guess I forgot to say the things that I was supposed to say... but that I honestly... always felt in my heart.
I am so proud of you, Addy.
I admire you so... for what you were able to overcome.
And I think you're beautiful.
Addy, I think you are... the most beautiful girl...
I ever met.
She says thank you.
And that she knows.
And that where she is now... on the other side... she's a pretty girl at last.
[ Chuckles ]
She also wants you to know that she's grateful... for not getting her to the lawn at the old house.
She doesn't want to be with Tate.
She's afraid of him, now that she knows the truth.
- [ Constance's Voice] Please don't hurt him!
Tate!
- [Sirens Wailing]
Tate!
Wait!
Let me just talk to him!
Will you please just let me talk to him?
Tate!
Tate!
No, please.
He'll go peacefully.

No.

- Are you?
- I'm sad.
Me too.

Something has changed in you.
Toward me.
You're distant, cold.
I don't know what I've done... but I'll leave you alone from now on if that's what you want.
Is that what you want?
You know why I'd leave you alone?
'Cause I care about your feelings more than mine.
I love you.
There, I said it.
Not just on some chalkboard.

I've never felt that way about anyone.
Come here.
I'm tired.

Of course not.
She's probably at the grocery store, buying some frozen fare to reheat for your supper tonight.
You found out about Tate, didn't you?
I knew you would.
Get out of my house!
This is not happening.
I questioned my sanity when I first found out..
But this house... this house will make you a believer.
You see, Violet, we were living here when Tate lost his way.
And I believe that the house drove him to it.
What?
No.
That can't be real.
You're a smart girl.
How can you be so arrogant to think that there's only one reality that you're able to see?
I want you to meet someone.
Violet Harmon, meet Billie Dean Howard.
The child has no manners.
Billie is a gifted medium.
She can help.
You're confused.
Overwhelmed.
Why wouldn't you be?
I never asked for any of this.
None of us did.
But nothing can be done once one's been chosen.
Billie has been helping me for years.
I first found her on Craigslist.
I've been through all the phonies, but she is 100% authentic.
I've just come from a meeting at Lifetime;
they're interested in making a pilot with me.
A Craigslist psychic with a Hollywood agent.
Who'd have thought?
A medium, dear.
I can't read your future.
That's a different gift.
Have some chamomile tea.
It'll calm the nerves.
I'm in a dream.
I used to be like you.
Until I was 25.
When out of the blue, my cleaning lady shows up as I'm brushing my teeth.
Except she's got no toilet brush and rubber gloves, she's naked and bloody.
Her husband murdered her with an ice pick.
It's hard to keep good help.
BILLIE:
Do you think I wanted a bloody Mexican ghost in my bathroom?
All I wanted was to improve my tennis game and unseat Charlotte Whitney as president of my book club.
But I was chosen.
And when you're chosen, you either get with the program or you go crazy.
Understanding the truth is your only choice.
What's your version of the truth?
There are some who have an understandably violent and vengeful reaction to being horribly murdered.
They refuse to move on, until they exact their pound of flesh.
Then there are a very few souls, like Tate, who don't even know they're dead, who walk among the living in child-like confusion.
That's why I wanted him to see your father.
I was hoping your father might help him achieve some clarity about himself so that he could see the truth on his own.
We must help him cross over, Violet.
This is bullshit.
I was set up.
My computer was-- someone messed with my...
Who is Mary?
VIVIEN:
Violet, she wants to talk to you.
(monitor beeping steadily)
I don't understand you.
Never will understand you.
Does that mean anything to you?
"They don't understand you?"

Can I trust her?

Okay, so I've checked the perimeter of the property, the upstairs, the basement.
Everything's secure.
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just hearing things.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
Oh, no, it's not a waste of time.
Not at all.
That's what I'm here for.
Even if it's only for your peace of mind.
Thank you.
My husband just moved out recently, so...
He had an affair, and don't know why I'm telling you this.
Oh, no.
It's okay.
Actually, we get sensitivity training.
We deal with people's worst fears, real or imaginary.
That makes sense.
But, actually, with the, uh, with the infidelity,
I have firsthand experience with that.
Hmm.
Not me.
No, my wife.
With another man?
It was a woman.
Yeah, I know.
A lot of guys would be into that, right?
Me, not so much.
(door opens)
What happened now?
I thought I heard somebody.
Where?
Outside or inside?
Outside.
I looked around, checked the alarm system.
Everything seems to be working fine.
Thanks for filling in.
Oh, by the way, the woman that I took out of here?
She never made it to the police station.
What?
I don't understand.
She must have hopped out of my vehicle at a stop sign or something.
Please keep you alarm on even when you're home.
Thank you.

What are you doing here?
I've got to work, Vivien.
Rent an office.
We don't the have the money, Viv!
I promise I'll leave right after my last patient.
I don't want you here.
You brought this on yourself.
(sighs) You're right.
And you're angry.
If you violated our marriage right in front of me, I'd be furious.
But I need a place to work, Vivien.
We need the money.
I'm finding it really hard to look at your face.
'Cause I really, really, really want to bash it in.
I find you disgusting... and disappointing as a man.
And we're gonna end this marriage and we're gonna sell this house and I'll let you be a father to our kids because I happen to think that you're a good one.
But I'm not gonna be your friend.
I will merely tolerate you.
And you can see your patients in the house, but I want you to leave after your last session of the day.

Are you scared now?
BEN:
Urban legends?
Urban legends, they, they terrify me.
Lately, it's gotten so bad I can't even function.
When you say "urban legends..."
All of 'em:
Bloody Mary, Candy Man,
Lady in White.
Children's ghost stories.
When I was younger, my brothers would tell them to me.
Hold me down, force me to listen to 'em.
Older brothers can be mean.
They were younger.
I see.
Nothing else scares me:
terrorism, disease, violent crime, crashing economy.
Just these stories that I know are utter bullshit.
I'm paralyzed, Doctor.
I can't maintain a relationship.
What girl wants to screw a grown man who has to sleep with his lights on?
Speaking of sleep, I can't.
I don't.
I binge eat.
I smoke like a fish.
Lately, it's gotten a lot worse.
I must look terrible.
I haven't had the courage to look in a mirror in the last week.
Why's that?
Piggy Man.
Piggy Man?
I don't think I heard that one before.
Oh, God.
It's, uh, it's terrifying.
Okay, story goes, um... he was a hog butcher in Chicago during the World's Fair of 1893.
And before he would go into the slaughter pen, he would put on this mask, this pig mask that he'd made from one of his other kills, and he would snort-- (snorts) you know, like a pig--
make 'em think he was one of them.
Then one day, he slipped and he fell.
The pigs, hogs tore him apart.
And they didn't find one piece of him anywhere.
So everyone assumed.
'Cause not too long after, his former customers, they started turning up dead;
gutted, skinned and hung upside down in the bathtub to drain, like a hog in his shop.
And they say if you stand in front of a mirror and say...
Here, piggy pig-pig.
"Here, piggy pig-pig,"
that he'll return for the slaughter.
And have you tried that?
Here, piggy pig... (squealing)
No.
But there's something inside of me that's afraid that I might.
And that scares the hell out of me.
We're gonna get to the root of what that is, I promise you.
Okay.
I want to see you again Wednesday, 3:00, all right?
Sure.
In the meantime, I want you to shave.
In a mirror?
Can you try, Derek?
Yeah.
Good.
Call me if you need me.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Dad?
Hey, honey.
I'm sorry, Daddy.
It's all my fault.
What?
No.
No, baby.
No, no, no.
Your mom and I both love you very much.
It's never gonna change.
It's the darkness.
It has me.
I have you.
Baby, I have you.
I have you.
She's a nurse in your department.
I think her name is Angie something?
She fainted during an ultrasound.
Right.
She's an ultrasound technician.
So she quit?
Would you ask her to call me, then?
Vivien Harmon.
Okay, thank, thank you.
Hi, Constance.
I'm so sorry about Adelaide.
I've been meaning to make a condolence call, and I've just been...
Moira tells me that you've been suffering terribly.
That every time you leave the house, you're racked with violent morning sickness?
Yeah.
Well, you know, my mother always recommended a big platter of offal during the first trimester of pregnancy.
She preferred pork.
Oh, well, how nice of you to think of me during this...
I believe life is for the living, don't you?
Sweetbreads.
Now these two are thymus glands, one from the heart, one from the throat.
And this is the pancreas.
It's so good for mother and child.
Full of protein, vitamin C, all the B vitamins and iron.
And speaking of which... how is your other baby?
She was such a dear sweet child, and such a comfort to me when Addie passed.
Well, she's been very upset.
Spending a lot of time in her room.
Sometimes, children going through transition just need alone time.
Well, I, um, can't thank you enough for the offal.
Offal.
Moira, why don't you sauté these for Mrs. Harmon's lunch?
Do 'em the way that you used to do them for me, remember?
With sweet butter.
I'd be happy to do that for Mrs. Harmon.
(chuckles) We need that baby.
We need another... sweet child around here.
May I say something that could be considered out of turn, but that is sincerely heartfelt?
I guess so.
Cheating on one's pregnant wife qualifies as an unspeakable criminal act.
It's on a par with murder.
And I'll tell you one thing I know, if I know anything at all--
Dr. Harmon will cheat again, if given half the chance.
I hope I haven't upset you, speaking my mind so directly.
Just a pinch of the sea salt, a tiny squeeze of the lemon, if you like.
Although I prefer without.
And ma'am,
I've left the pancreas uncooked.
They say it's the tenderest organ of them all, especially when eaten raw.
Oh...
Uh, no,
I don't think so, Moira.
Think of the baby.
Mmm.
Mmm.
DEREK:
I don't think I can do this.
Have you been doing the exercises we talked about-- looking in the bathroom mirror at home?
Yeah, but I cheated.
I used my toaster-- it has a very reflective surface.
(chuckles) Okay, well, that's a start.
You're in my house now.
And you're safe.
You're safe.
I'm going to stand right outside this door.
I can't do it.
Here.
Use this.
But only if you have to.
Breathe...
I'm going to turn off the light.
I'm going to close the door, and I'll be right outside.
Breathe, just breathe.
That's it.
Turning off the light.

We have to be nice to Mommy today.
And keep her off her feet.
Will do.
Regina is going to find the perfect spot so we don't hurt the baby.
Right there.
You're going to feel a tiny pinch.
I owe you an apology.
It attacked you too, didn't it?
No.
But I don't know what's real anymore.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
The Devil is real.
And he's not a little red man with horns and a tail.
He can be beautiful.
Because he's a fallen angel, and he used to be God's favorite.
Have you read the Book of Revelation?
No.
In Heaven, there's this woman in labor howling in pain.
And there's a red dragon with seven heads waiting so he can eat her baby.
But the Archangel Michael, he hurls the dragon down to earth.
From that moment on, the red dragon hates the woman, and declares war on her and all of her children.
That's us.
Oh, yeah, things have gotten pretty weird for me.
Me, too.
I can't eat, I can't sleep.
The nights are the worst.
I get four hours, if I'm lucky.
That's only with pills.
What kind of pills?
Can I have one?
They were over by the sofa.
Used to be a row of tables.
I get four or five of you sickos a year.
Usually freshmen.
What, are you a transfer?
You're that teacher.
You're like a hero.
Now you know what heroes look like.
Wait, I'm sorry.
I'm not like those other kids.
I know Tate.
I mean, I know his mom.
We moved next door to her.
Did you know him?
Before he did this?
I knew his face.
Didn't seem like a bad kid, actually.
He was in here a lot.
Kind of thoughtful, liked to read.
Byron, books on birds, random stuff.
Was he bullied or something?
Did he even know the kids he shot?
I just want to know why he did it.
Me, too.
Why are you bullshitting me?
!
If the bullet had been an inch to the right, it would've missed my spine and I would have walked out of here.
Might have even been able to stop him.
An inch higher, it would have killed me.
Sometimes shit just happens.
Good people don't just have a bad day and start shooting people.
Maybe he wasn't a good person.
Moira.
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.
You've lost the baby.
No, no, no, no.
Oh.
Stop.
Stop cleaning and come sit down.
Have a seat.
I'm afraid we're going to have to let you go.
I don't understand.
The house is spotless.
It has nothing to do with you, believe me.
Mrs. Harmon, this is not a job.
For me, coming here is a reprieve.
I understand.
We just can't afford it.
Then I'll work for free, till you sell.
I'll make the house gleam and glitter for the new owners.
Then, perhaps, they'll hire me.
Mrs. Harmon, I've had my share of regrets.
But leaving an expectant mother in the time of her need will not be one of them.
I'm staying.
(laughing)
You're being so dramatic.
I'm not helpless, Moira.
Well, I'm not one to belabor a point, but where has the time gone?
You must be famished.
I mean, I am hungry.
Constance dropped by earlier with another delicious delicacy.
No.
I don't want you cooking for me.
Please, don't go to the trouble.
Come on.
No trouble at all.
It's served raw.

[ Whimpers ] It's okay.
[ Rattling Continues ]

Get the door.

[ Mouthing Words ]
[ Footsteps Approaching ]
No, no.
Please, don't!
[ Gunshot ]
- [ Girl Whimpering ] - [ Whispering ] Get to the phone!
[ Tapping Buttons ]
[ Gunshot ]
Screw this.
It's gonna be okay.
Yeah, everything is gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
[ Shell Rattles ]
Hey!
- It's enough.
Get out of here.
- [ Gunshot ]

- [ Shotgun Cocks ]
- Oh, God!
[ Sirens Wailing ] [ Sobbing ]
No!
Oh, God.
[ Sobbing ]
[ Sirens Wailing ]
Please!
[ Screams ]
Why?
[ Sobbing ] Why?
[ Shotgun Cocks ] [ Sobs ]
[ Sirens Wailing ] Please.
[ Gunshot ]
[ Constance ] Please, don't hurt him.
Let me talk to him.
Please, just let me talk to him.
Tate!
Tate.
No, please.
He'll go peacefully.
He's just a child!
He's just a child!
Tate!
Tate!
No!
[ Silently Mimics Gunshot ]
[ Typing ]
[ Breathing Erratically ]
Mom?
Mom?
Mommy.
- She's not here.
- Where is she?
Did you hurt her?
[ Chuckles ] Of course not.
She's probably at the grocery store, buying some frozen fare to reheat for your supper tonight.
You found out about Tate, didn't you?
- I knew you would.
- Get out of my house.
- This is not happening.
- I questioned my sanity when I first found out.
But this house... this house will make you a believer.
You see, Violet, we were living here... when Tate lost his way.
And I believe that the house drove him to it.
What?
No.
That can't be real.
You're a smart girl.
How can you be so arrogant... to think that there's only one reality that you're able to see?
I want you to meet someone.
[ Door Closes ]
Violet Harmon, meet Billie Dean Howard.
[ Chuckles ] The child has no manners.
Billie is a gifted medium.
She can help.
You're confused.
Overwhelmed.
Why wouldn't you be?
I never asked for any of this.
None of us did.
But nothing can be done once one's been chosen.
Billie has been helping me for years.
I first found her on Craigslist.
I've been through all the phonies, but she is 100% authentic.
I've just come from a meeting at Lifetime.
They're interested in making a pilot with me.
A Craigslist psychic with a Hollywood agent.
Who'd have thought?
A medium, dear.
I can't read your future.
That's a different gift.
Have some chamomile tea.
It'll calm the nerves.
- I'm in a dream.
- I used to be like you.
Until I was 25, when out of the blue, my cleaning lady... shows up as I'm brushing my teeth.
Except she's got no toilet brush and rubber gloves.
She's naked and bloody.
- Her husband murdered her with an ice pick.
- It's hard to keep good help.
Do you think I wanted a bloody Mexican ghost in my bathroom?
All I wanted was to improve my tennis game... and unseat Charlotte Whitney as president of my book club.
But I was chosen.
And when you're chosen, you either get with the program, or you go crazy.
Understanding the truth is your only choice.
What's your version of the truth?
There are some who have an understandably violent... and vengeful reaction to being horribly murdered.
They refuse to move on... until they exact their pound of flesh.
Then there are a very few souls, like Tate, who don't even know they're dead, who walk among the living in childlike confusion.
That's why I wanted him to see your father.
I was hoping your father might help him achieve... some clarity about himself... that he could see the truth on his own.
We must help him cross over, Violet.
This is bullshit.
I was set up.
My computer was...
Someone messed with my...
Who is Mary?
Violet, she wants to talk to you.
[ Monitor Beeping ]
They don't understand you.
Never will understand you.
Does that mean anything to you?
"They don't understand you"?
[ Sobs ]
[ Door Opens ]
[ Door Closes ] Can I trust her?
I'm not sure.
[ Cello Solo ]
[ Scream Echoes ]
[ Ring Clinks ]
[ Beeps ]
Okay, so I've checked the perimeter of the property, the upstairs, the basement.
- Everything's secure.
- I don't know.
Maybe I'm just hearing things.
- I'm sorry I wasted your time.
- Oh, no, it's not a waste of time.
Not at all.
That's what I'm here for.
Even if it's only for your peace of mind.
Well, thank you.
My husband just moved out recently, so...
He had an affair and...
Don't know why I'm telling you this.
Oh, no.
That's okay.
Yeah.
Actually, we get sensitivity training.
We deal with people's worst fears, real or imaginary.
That makes sense.
But, actually, with the, uh... with the infidelity?
- I have firsthand experience with that.
- Hmm.
Not me.
No.
My wife.
- With another man?
- It was a woman.
Yeah, I know.
Lot of guys would be into that, right?
- Me, not so much.
- [ Door Opens ]
What happened now?
I thought I heard somebody.
- Where?
Outside or inside?
- Outside.
I looked around, checked the alarm system.
Everything seems to be working fine.
Well, thanks for filling in.
Oh, by the way, the woman I took out of here?
She never made it to the police station.
What?
I don't understand.
She must have hopped out of my vehicle at a stop sign or something.
Please, keep your alarm on even when you're home.
- Thank you.
- All right.
[ Door Opens, Closes ]
- What are you doing here?
- I've gotta work, Vivien.
- Rent an office.
- We don't have the money, Viv.
I promise I'll leave... right after my last patient.
I don't want you here.
You brought this on yourself.
[ Exhales ]
You're right.
And you're angry.
If you violated our marriage right in front of me, I'd be furious.
But I need a place to work, Vivien.
We need the money.
I'm finding it really hard to look at your face.
'Cause I really, really, really want to bash it in.
I find you disgusting... and disappointing as a man.
And we're gonna end this marriage, and we're gonna sell this house.
And I'll let you be a father to our kids... because I happen to think that you're a good one.
But I'm not gonna be your friend.
I will merely tolerate you.
And you can see your patients in the house, but I want you to leave after your last session of the day.
Are you scared now?
[ Ben ] Urban legends?
Uh, urban legends...
they, uh... they terrify me.
Lately it's gotten so bad I can't even function.
When you say urban legends...
All of them.
Uh, Bloody Mary, Candyman, Lady in White.
- Children's ghost stories.
- When I was younger, my brothers would tell them to me... hold me down, force me to listen to 'em.
Older brothers can be mean.
- They were younger.
- I see.
Nothing else scares me...
terrorism, uh, disease, violent crime, crashing economy.
Just these stories that I know are utter bullshit.
I'm paralyzed, Doctor.
I can't maintain a relationship.
What girl wants to screw a grown man who has to sleep with his lights on?
Speaking of sleep, I can't.
I don't.
I binge eat.
I smoke like a fish.
Lately it's gotten a lot worse.
I must look terrible.
I haven't had the courage to look in a mirror in the last week.
Why is that?
Piggy Man.
Piggy Man?
I don't think I heard that one before.
Oh, God.
It's, uh...
It's terrifying.
Okay, story goes, um, he was a hog butcher in Chicago... during the World's Fair of 1893.
And before he would go into the slaughter pen, he would put on this mask... this pig mask... that he'd made from one of his other kills.
And he would snort... [ Snorts ] You know, like a pig.
Make 'em think he was one of them.
Then one day he slipped, and he fell.
The pigs, hogs, tore him apart.
And they didn't find one piece of him anywhere.
So everyone assumed.
Because not too long after, his former customers... they started turning up dead.
Gutted, skinned... and hung upside down in a bathtub to drain, like a hog in his shop.
And they say if you stand... in front of a mirror and say...
Here, piggy pig-pig.
"Here, piggy pig-pig,"
that he'll return for the slaughter.
And have you tried that?
Here, piggy pig...
[ Squealing ]
[ Screams ]
[ Squealing, Snorting ]
No.
But there's something inside of me... that's afraid that I might.
And that scares the hell out of me.
We're gonna get to the root of what that is.
I promise you.
Okay.
I want to see you again, uh,
Wednesday, 3:00, all right?
- Sure.
- In the meantime, I want you to shave.
- In a mirror?
- Can you try, Derek?
- Yeah.
- Good.
Call me if you need me.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
[ Door Opens, Closes ]
Dad.
Hey, honey.
I'm sorry, Daddy.
- It's all my fault.
- What?
No.
No, baby.
No, no, no.
Your mom and I both love you very much.
It's never gonna change.
It's the darkness.
It has me.
I have you.
Baby, I have you.
I have you.
She's a nurse in your department.
I think her name is Angie something.
She fainted during an ultrasound.
Right.
She's an ultrasound technician.
So she quit?
Would you ask her to call me then?
Vivien Harmon.
Okay.
Thank you.
Hi, Constance.
I'm so sorry about Adelaide.
I've been meaning to make a condolence call, and I've just been...
Moira tells me that you've been suffering terribly... that every time you leave the house you're racked with violent morning sickness?
Yeah.
Well, you know, my mother... always recommended a big platter of offal... during the first trimester of pregnancy.
She preferred pork.
Oh, well, how nice of you to think of me during this...
[ Chuckles ] I believe life is for the living, don't you?
Sweetbreads.
Now these two are thymus glands... one from the heart, one from the throat.
And this is the pancreas.
It's so good for mother and child.
Full of protein, vitamin "C,"
all the "B" vitamins and iron and...
Speaking of which, how is your other baby?
She was such a dear, sweet child... and such a comfort to me when Addy passed.
Well, she's been very upset.
Spending a lot of time in her room.
Sometimes children going through transition just need alone time.
Well, I, um, can't thank you enough for the "awful."
Offal.
Moira, why don't you saut?
these for Mrs. Harmon's lunch?
Do 'em the way that you used to do them for me, remember?
With sweet butter.
- I'd be happy to do that, for Mrs. Harmon.
- [ Chuckles ]
[ Chuckles ] We need that baby.
We need another... sweet child around here.
[ Sizzling ]
May I say something that could be considered out of turn, but that is sincerely heartfelt?
I guess so.
Cheating on one's pregnant wife qualifies as an unspeakable criminal act.
It's on a par with murder.
And I'll tell you one thing I know, if I know anything at all.
Dr. Harmon will cheat again if given half the chance.
I hope I haven't upset you, speaking my mind so directly.
Just a pinch of the sea salt, a tiny squeeze of lemon if you like, although I prefer without.
And, ma'am, I've left the pancreas uncooked.
They say it's the tenderest organ of them all, especially when eaten raw.
Oh.
Uh, no, I don't think so, Moira.
Think of the baby.
Mmm.
Mmm.
[ Derek ] I don't think I can do this.
Have you been doing the exercises we talked about?
Looking in the bathroom mirror at home?
Yeah, but I cheated.
I used my toaster.
It has a very reflective surface.
[ Chuckles ] Okay.
Well, that's a start.
You're in my house now.
And you're safe.
You're safe.
I'm gonna stand right outside this door.
I can't do it.
Here.
Use this.
But only if you have to.
Breathe.
I'm gonna turn off the light.
I'm gonna close the door, and I'll be right outside.
[ Breathing Erratically ]
Breathe.
Just breathe.
That's it.
Turning off the light.
[ Whimpering ]
And I'm gonna shut the door.
[ Panicked Breathing ]
I think I'm having a heart attack!
I'm right here, Derek.
Five feet away.
Just say the words.
Nothing's gonna happen.
Here, piggy, pig-pig.
[ Whoosh ]
[ Water Dripping ]
Here, piggy... pig...
[ Screaming ]
Derek.
Derek, it's okay.
It's okay.
There's some...
There's something in there!
It's okay.
It's all right.
[ Whimpers ] There's no one in there.
You see?
[ Sobbing ] It's never gonna stop.
I'm broken!
No, no, no, no.
I didn't even get to the last pig.
Over 5,000 amnios and not a single miscarriage, but who's counting?
And so this would...
for the Down syndrome?
Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida.
The amnio results should put your mind at ease.
Sorry I'm late.
Traffic was insane.
You didn't have to leave work to come here.
- Of course he should.
He's the daddy.
- That's right.
I'm the daddy.
We have to be nice to Mommy today... [ Door Closes ]
And keep her off her feet.
Will do.
Regina is going to find the perfect spot, so we don't hurt the baby.
Right... there.
You're gonna feel a tiny pinch.
[ Groans ]
I owe you an apology.
- It attacked you too, didn't it?
- No.
But, I don't know what's real anymore.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
The devil is real.
And he's not a little red man with horns and a tail.
He can be beautiful.
'Cause he's a fallen angel, and he used to be God's favorite.
Have you read the Book of Revelation?
No.
In heaven, there's this woman in labor, howling in pain.
And there's a... there's a red dragon with seven heads waiting, so he can eat her baby.
But the archangel Michael... he hurls the dragon down to Earth.
From that moment on, the red dragon hates the woman... and declares war on her and all of her children.
That's us.
Uh, yeah, things have gotten pretty weird for me.
Me too.
I can't eat.
I can't sleep.
The nights are the worst.
I get... four hours if I'm lucky.
That's only with pills.
What kind of pills?
Can I have one?
[ Wheelchair Motor Whirring ]
They were over by the sofa.
Used to be a row of tables.
I get four or five of you sickos a year.
Usually freshmen.
What, are you a transfer?
You're that teacher.
- You're like a hero.
- Now you know what heroes look like.
Wait.
I'm sorry.
I'm not like those other kids.
I know Tate.
I mean, I know his mom.
We moved next door to her.
Did you know him?
Before he did this?
I knew his face.
Didn't seem like a bad kid actually.
He was in here a lot.
Kind of thoughtful.
Liked to read.
Byron, books on birds, random stuff.
Was he bullied or something?
Did he even know the kids he shot?
I just want to know why he did it.
Me too.
Why are you bullshitting me?
If the bullet had been an inch to the right, it would have missed my spine, and I would have walked out of here.
Might have even been able to stop him.
An inch higher, it would have killed me.
Sometimes...
shit just happens.
Good people don't just have a bad day and start shooting people.
Maybe he wasn't a good person.
Moira.
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.
- You've lost the baby.
- No.
No, no, no.
[ Sighs ]
Stop...
Stop cleaning and come sit down.
Come sit.
I'm afraid that we're gonna have to let you go.
I don't understand.
The house is spotless.
It has nothing to do with you, believe me.
Mrs. Harmon, this is not a job.
For me, coming here is a reprieve.
I understand.
We just can't afford it.
Then I'll work for free till you sell.
I'll make the house gleam and glitter for the new owners.
Then perhaps they'll hire me.
Mrs. Harmon, I've had my share of regrets.
But leaving an expectant mother in the time of her need will not be one of them.
I'm staying.
[ Chuckles ]
You're being so dramatic.
I'm not helpless, Moira.
Well, I'm not one to belabor a point, but where has the time gone?
- You must be famished.
- I mean, I am hungry.
Constance dropped by earlier with another delicious delicacy.
No.
I don't want you cooking for me.
Please, don't go to the trouble.
Come on.
No trouble at all.
It's served raw, so you and the baby get the full measure of vitamins.
It's the most nutritious organ of them all.
It came from an organic farm.
I hear the raw food movement is really taking off.
For the baby.
[ Crickets Chirping ]
[ Beeping ]
Tate?
Tate?
I'm not playing hide-and-seek, Tate.
You have to leave now!
- [ Whip Cracking ] - [ Girl Giggling ]
Get out of my house!
Look at what he did to me.
[ Screams ]
Excuse me, ma'am.
I don't want to bother you, but I'm hurt and needing some help.
- [ Woman Screams ]
- Has my wife medicated you?
Are you here for the procedure?
[ Rock ]
[ Stops ]
[ Breathing Heavily ]
[ Sobbing ]
[ Gagging ]
Don't you die on me, Violet!
No.
Don't you die!
[ Sobbing ]
Don't you die on me.
Violet!
[ Gagging, Coughing ]
[ Sobbing ]
[ Crying ]
Have you been doing the cognitive exercises we talked about?
Yes.
Nothing helps.
I can't take this anxiety.
The other night, I meet a girl...
Allyson, works in accounting.
- There's a real chemistry there.
- Derek, that's great.
- Ask her out.
Get out of your own head.
- I...
I would love to.
But what happens if she wants to come home with me some night?
How do I explain why all the mirrors are covered up?
Derek, you're doing this to yourself.
Think of it as a psychological law of physics.
The more you fear something, the more power you give it.
You need to conquer this thing, Derek.
You're gonna go home.
You're gonna look in the mirror.
And you're gonna say those words.
They're not magic words.
There is no Piggy Man.
Once you face that, you can finally start to deal with the real issues in your life.
I mean, you're absolutely right.
I want to do it.
I can do it.
The moment you do, you'll be free.
[ Praying Silently ] [ Bell Tolling ]
Angela.
Vivien.
Thank you so much for agreeing to meet with me.
Of course.
That's, uh, probably close enough.
When you gave me the address, I didn't realize it was a church.
It's where I feel safe.
The hospital said you quit your job, but they didn't say why.
I've been concerned because of the ultrasound and...
They said that the machine malfunctioned, but... it seemed to me that you saw something that scared you.
Yes, and I've been praying about it ever since.
I saw the unclean thing, what you carry in your womb.
The plague of nations, the Beast.
Okay, so you didn't see anything.
So, the machine malfunctioned.
It did not.
I saw the little hooves.
You need some help.
[ Angela ] And the woman was full of the filthiness of her fornication.
The mother of harlots and abominations of the Earth!
[ Quietly ] Here, piggy, piggy, pig.
[ Louder ] Here, piggy, piggy, pig... pig.
Here, piggy, piggy, pig.
- Who you calling a pig?
- [ Gunshot ]
What the hell did you do?
This was supposed to be a robbery.
Now it's murder, you asshole.
He called me a pig.
We gotta get out of here.
[ Chuckling ] [ Scoffs ] I am beginning to think you're a fraud.
And that nail polish is vulgar.
Don't take it out on me just because your dead daughter is mad at you.
Now why the hell would you say that to me?
Because you're capable of handling the truth.
I see it all the time.
The dead can hold a grudge better than most Scorpios.
I want to talk to her, Billie.
I have one last thing... that I have to say to her.
I just miss her so terribly.
She was my reason for living.
She says you should have told her that when she was alive.
- She's a feisty one.
- [ Chuckles ]
Talk to her.
She's here.
Come on.
[ Inhales, Exhales Deeply ]
[ Chuckles ]
Baby,
I am so sorry.
I'm sorry because... most of the time that I was with you, especially when you were younger,
I was just so overwhelmed.
It wasn't easy being a single parent, and you were such a handful.
So I guess I forgot to say the things that I was supposed to say... but that I honestly... always felt in my heart.
I am so proud of you, Addy.
I admire you so... for what you were able to overcome.
And I think you're beautiful.
Addy, I think you are... the most beautiful girl...
I ever met.
She says thank you.
And that she knows.
And that where she is now, on the other side, she's a pretty girl at last.
[ Chuckles ]
She also wants you to know that she's grateful... for not getting her to the lawn at the old house.
She doesn't want to be with Tate.
She's afraid of him, now that she knows the truth.
[ Constance's Voice ] Please don't hurt him!
Tate!
[ Sirens Wailing ]
Tate!
Wait!
Let me just talk to him!
Will you please just let me talk to him?
Tate!
Tate!
No, please.
He'll go peacefully.
- [ Door Bursts Open ]
- He's just a child!
He's just a child!
[ Sirens Wailing ]
[ Silently Mimics Gunshot ]
Why did you do it?
[ Fire Truck Horn Honking ] [ Sirens Wailing ]
[ Sirens And Honking Continue ]
I like birds too.
Why do you like them?
'Cause they can fly away when things get too crazy, I guess.
Are you gonna tell your parents?
About the pills?
No.
I've been sleeping a lot.
They think I'm depressed.
- Are you?
- I'm sad.
Me too.
Violet.
Something has changed in you.
Toward me.
You're distant, cold.
I don't know what I've done, but I'll leave you alone from now on if that's what you want.
Is that what you want?
You know why I'd leave you alone?
'Cause I care about your feelings more than mine.
I love you.
There, I said it.
Not just on some chalkboard.
I would never let anybody or anything hurt you.
I've never felt that way about anyone.
Come here.
I'm tired.
Me too.
Hey, iso.
At the time of the Boshin Civil War, your grandfather was already 77 years old.
But he bravely charged the enemy.
He died a glorious death.
Our city, Nagaoka, burned for three days and nights.
The whole city burned to ashes.
It was a horrible sight to behold.
That was 20 years ago.
Time does fly...
THE admiral (ADMlRAL YAMAMOTO)
DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY
Company, halt!
Left turn!
Take aim!
What the hell are you up to!
How dare you aim at the Navy!
How dare you!
Withdraw!
If the Army wants a fight, let us be prepared!
Hurry to the generators!
If they cut off our water and power, 3,000 men won't be able to flush!
Withdraw!
At ease!
Company, advance!
Yes.
Excuse me.
I've ordered a Yokosuka land battalion to stand by.
I see.
The Army is insolent!
To conclude the Tripartite Pact, they're even threatening a coup d'etat.
That was a real scare.
I thought they'd really shoot.
The Army and Navy shooting at each other is no joking matter.
But I trust all is well, Yamamoto?
Yes.
With General Inoue in charge, things will be fine.
Right.
I'll excuse myself, then.
Minister.
Please make no scandalous detours on your way home today.
Right.
Only because you insist.
He'll detour.
Yes, a detour is written all over his face.
Excuse me.
Undersecretary, Chief Editor Munakata of Tokyo Nippo is here.
Oh, it's that time already?
I leave you in charge.
Shindo here was completely panicked that a battle was about to start.
At this rate, we could repeat the tragedy of the February 26 coup from three years ago.
Undersecretary, you should look after your own personal safety.
I appreciate your concern.
Even with things in this state, will the Navy still oppose the Tripartite Pact?
Yes, of course.
is your reason America?
If we side with Germany, America won't sit still.
Which country stole land from our countrymen with their discriminatory law?
America.
And proposed the League of Nations but refuses to join over the Monroe Doctrine?
America.
On top of that, expands their own colonies, but refuses to acknowledge our rightful national interests in Asia?
As you say.
Why wouldn't you try to sweep aside such a country?
Can you sweep them aside?
It's true.
Their shipbuilding capacity is 4.5 times ours.
For aeroplanes, six times, for cars, 100 times.
For oil, 700 times ours.
In half a day, they produce Japan's annual consumption.
In national strength, America is 10 times stronger than Japan.
Your understanding is correct.
But in the Russo-Japanese war, we beat Russia, also 10 times our might, right?
At the time, Russia was undergoing a revolution.
Thus, we could sue for peace after one victorious battle.
But today, wars are total wars.
It will not end until one side has burned to ashes.
So we should shut up and do America's bidding?
No.
We must boldly assert our nation's conditions and confront our opponents without fear.
But that, should be handled by diplomacy.
That is my point.
Your point is well taken.
But the last resort of diplomacy is war... ls it not?
Listen, Mr Munakata, once you start a war, there's no turning back.
We must not bring catastrophe upon our nation by charging without sober deliberation.
So we must grin and bear it?
Even if our people are smothered by this gloomy helplessness?
Isn't it you, who are fanning the flames of this helplessness you refer to?
The newspapers simply represent public opinion.
This public opinion, is it truly the voice of the people?
Right.
Welcome back!
- Shindo, Shindo!
- Yes!
Did you get Undersecretary Yamamoto?
The chief is in his room.
Okay!
He'll write the editorial in time.
Akiyama!
What was Undersecretary Yamamoto like?
He's a mysterious man.
But it's clear the Tripartite Pact is a long way off.
Internally, the Navy is still fighting the Boshin War.
The Boshin War?
The Navy's inner circle come from Satsuma and Choshu clans.
But the minister and the general come from Morioka and Sendai.
And the Undersecretary comes from Nagaoka.
They all fought Satsuma and Choshu.
I see, of course they'll clash.
WAR RECORDS OF Imperial JAPAN
War Records of Imperial Japan.
In 1 868, even as the Boshin Civil War raged, our nation entered the new Meiji era, and based on twin victories over Russia and China, grew to be counted among the world's five great nations.
And the Great War, which erupted in the Taisho era, brought our nation unprecedented prosperity.
But as the Showa era dawned, the great depression stormed Japan.
Advancing on Manchuria was Japan's solution.
Ever since, our conflict with China intensified and over the course of seven years of localized combat, domestically, Japan witnessed three major military coups d'etats, spreading social anxiety.
On July 7th, 1937, war with China erupts.
Japan and China are finally in full-scale war.
The Army believed it would win in one month, but the Soviet Union, England, and America all aided Chiang Kai-shek's government and the fighting bogged down.
That was when Germany, under command of Hitler, asked Japan to join the Tripartite Pact with Italy.
For Japan, bogged down in China, it was an extremely attractive offer.
The Japanese people were in a frenzy over Germany's ferocious military advance over Europe.
But despite an avalanche of support for the Tripartite Pact, the Navy's sole opposition managed to prevent its conclusion.
"...to join forces with our German ally,
"to liberate Asia from the grip of the Euro-American powers,
"in order to build the New East Asian Order,
"now is the time for the Navy to decisively support the Tripartite Pact.
"We fervently desire this."
All right, that's the editorial.
Submit this!
Yes!
Yes?
Political Desk.
Aborted assassination?
assassination PLOT
UNDERSECRETARY YAMAMOTO TARGET I demand that the Navy's Yonai, Yamamoto, and Inoue, who all advance
Britain and America's cause, by blocking the Tripartite Pact, so essential to Japanese policy today, all resign immediately!
The Military Police have offered protection.
The usual routine is fine.
The Army's Military Police scare me more.
But, Sir...
The usual routine is fine.
If my death awakens the Japanese people, so be it.
Totally inappropriate!
Don't twist things your way!
Isn't the Tripartite Pact necessary so that Germany can restrain the Soviet Union from invading south!
lncomprehensible!
Do you have any brains in your head?
Why the hell would Germany move to support Japan?
What!
Oh, Sir...
Are you all analysing international affairs?
These naval officers are worse than the Army.
Undersecretary, why do you not acknowledge the strength of our ally, Germany?
Our ally?
You're awfully devoted to Germany.
In that case, I presume you've read Hitler's Mein Kampf?
Every last page.
In other words, the Japanese are an inferior race, lacking in imagination, but they are skilful and clever and perfect for Germany to use!
I never read those words!
Of course not!
Because Chapter 1 1 in your edition is conveniently deleted!
Unfortunately, it seems an essential part was missing from the Japanese translation you men read.
If you don't trace things back to their source, you can overlook the essentials.
Enter.
Excuse me.
What?
Germany signed a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union.
Your ally has sided with our sworn enemy.
Prime Minister Hiranuma is dissolving the cabinet.
The signing of the non-aggression pact between Germany and the Soviet...
Hitler gave up on Japan because we dithered.
Farewell Tripartite Pact.
War with America will have to wait thanks to the cowards in the Navy.
- Welcome.
- All done with the show?
I'm so hungry.
Noodles please!
At least remove your stage makeup before filling your belly.
Nobody brings me snacks to my dressing room any more.
Not in this economy... lf they don't start a war soon, my factory will go bankrupt.
Say, if a war starts, will the economy really get better?
In the Great War, 20 years ago, the economy quickly recovered.
That's right, war is best.
We're already at war with China.
We can't start wars everywhere.
But it's America that's behind China.
So if we beat America, we can beat China, too.
Exactly!
YAMAMOTO PROMOTED TO FLEET COMMANDER
Six pence!
This one, too.
Minister, the Tripartite Pact negotiations ended, but none of the problems are solved.
Please let me remain and serve as Undersecretary.
But if you stay here in headquarters, you'll run out of lives.
Why don't you spend some time out at sea.
Hey, Inoue.
Thank you for your long service.
I'm grateful.
You forcefully pressured the Ministry into stopping the Tripartite Pact.
You saved the Navy.
No, I had my hands full reining in the youth.
Which left no time for constructive discussions about the future of Japan. I'm disappointed.
Well... ln the fall, I'll be transferred to the China Sea fleet.
I had hoped that at least you would stay in the Ministry.
Admiral Yamamoto...
Thank you for everything.
Right, we'll meet again.
So you're the Fleet Commander.
You, who never aspired to fame or fortune.
You're unmatched in the Navy, Hori, and much more suited than me.
Won't you take my place?
I'm a civilian now.
They fired me five years ago.
"Fleet in being."
A nation's navy is always defending.
It exists to guarantee peace.
The non-combative fleet you kept lobbying for, is hard to realise.
The current Military Command knows nothing of war and neither do the military planners.
It's impossible to persuade them.
Hori...
Yeah?
Take my place?
It's been five years since I've been to sea.
September, 1939,
Yamamoto bid farewell to the Navy Ministry.
And he assumed his post as Fleet Commander on the flagship, Nagato, based on Hashira Island in the Inland Sea.
Just then, the blitzkrieg struck Europe.
Germany finally launched its attack against Poland.
In response, England and France declared war.
The peace in Europe did not even last 20 years, and eight months passed in this new Second World War.
Meanwhile, under Yamamoto's command, the Japanese fleet improved the performance of its aircraft carriers, vigorously training its carrier-based planes.
May, 1940,
Germany broke its inaction and began invading again.
Quickly conquering Belgium and Holland, in one month, it occupied Paris.
It was an overwhelming victory, a "blitzkrieg" in every sense.
As though in concert with Germany's blitzkrieg, voices called anew for the Tripartite Pact in Japan.
The Germans can't seem to be stopped.
Once our Yamato battleship is built, we'll be invincible.
Chief of Staff, the future belongs to aeroplanes.
We could build 1 ,000 planes for the price of one of your battleships.
Listen, the history of our Japanese Navy is built on battles at sea...
These inland Sea sardines are tasty.
Yes.
Both of you hail from the Inland Sea area, don't you?
Yes.
I'm envious.
Your fish are tasty to the bone.
Where did you get these, the sweet dumplings!
Sweet dumplings?
Enter, Makino.
Excuse me.
I'm Ensign Makino, who served under you at Kasumigaura Air Corps.
I assumed my position on the Akagi's combat unit yesterday.
Good to hear.
is this your doing?
Yes!
I was given leave and went home to Nagaoka.
They're my mother's homemade dumplings.
Try some.
Sugar on sweet dumplings?
That's right.
is your mother well?
She is delighted that I will be working under your command.
Tasty.
Enjoy.
Thanks.
Saeki, your rear!
Oh, no, rats!
Great!
Victory!
Arima, stay focused on your rear!
Yes!
Always a battlefield?
Yes, it means endeavour in everything as though you are at war.
But the Nagaoka samurai have three principles.
Three?
The second is Kawai's spirit of duty.
Kawai fought to the bitter end, never forgetting his debt to the Shogunate.
-Tokugawa?
-Debt?
Yes.
Thirdly, the spirit of 100 bushels of rice.
One hundred bushels of rice?
Even after the battle was lost and our clansmen were starving, our clan clung to the gift of 100 bushels of rice, building a school with its profit.
When everyone was starving?
A hundred bushels of rice are gone if you eat them.
But if you spend it on people, it can grow to be 10,000 bushels.
If you are to lead men, always consider the future.
ALWAYS A battlefield
100,000 men.
What?
We lost 100,000 men in the Russo-Japanese war.
But after 20 or 30 years, everyone quickly forgets.
The newspapers and the people.
Being good at forgetting is one of our people's strengths, as well.
- Please.
- l know.
In order to participate in Germany's new world economy, now is the time to conclude the Tripartite Pact.
We must not miss this bus...
The Tripartite Pact, is now an agreement between four nations, including the Soviet Union, and confronted with these four nations, even America will reconsider its disrespect.
We are done with the weak-willed Navy!
Now is the time to conclude the Tripartite Pact!
Don't miss the bus!
Listen, Navy Minister!
ministry OF THE NAVY l have onlyjust taken Yoshida's place as Navy Minister, but political stagnation must not be permitted.
If the Navy persists in opposing the Tripartite Pact,
Konoe's cabinet will be forced to resign and we cannot be held to blame.
Therefore, I reluctantly propose that we revise our policy.
I hope that you officers will join my support for the Tripartite Pact.
Any objections?
Please wait.
I swear total allegiance to your command, Minister.
But I do have some concerns, so let me ask you, if the Tripartite Pact is concluded, the chances of a conflict with America increase.
Currently, our lack of aviators is apparent.
If we do go to war with America, we will need 1 ,000 fighter planes and 1 ,000 bombers.
In other words, we must double our current plane strength.
But our country relies on America for steel, oil and other manufacturing resources.
If we sign with Germany now, we will inevitably lose all of that.
In which case, how have you revised your plans, to compensate for that loss?
Please tell me.
We will await the future deliberations of each department...
Minister, that is not an answer.
Please tell me the reason why you think a war against America is possible.
I'm sure you have your opinions, but the majority is in favour, so...
Excuse me.
A telegram from the commander.
"Begin planning the attack."
I'm home!
Oh, my.
Welcome home.
Yes.
Thanks for the food.
Yoshimasa, pickles are for the end of the meal.
Yes.
Take a sip of miso soup before you eat rice.
What's most important is to clean your plate and eat your fill.
Yes.
Here, Yoshimasa.
Here.
Thank you.
Here, Sumi.
There you go.
Thank you.
Here, Ma.
Thank you.
Here, Tadao.
Thank you.
Here, Mother.
Thank you.
Commander Yamamoto, it seems we'll finallyjoin the Tripartite Pact.
"The national defence
"is to provide requisite armed forces, but also to grow national strength,
"while using diplomacy to evade war.
"That is the essence of national defence.
"ln other words,
"the national defence is not exclusive to soldiers..."
Those are the words of Admiral Kato, who, taking Japan's future into consideration, decided to sign the Washington Disarmament Treaty, limiting naval armaments.
The words of that notorious Prime Minister Kato who created the flip-flop cabinet.
September 27th, 1940.
The Tripartite Pact which shook our nation for three years, was finally concluded.
The bus Japan climbed on has taken off, engines gunning.
Who's in my plane?
Commander.
I wish this could fly to Monaco.
Excuse me, Sir!
There's a gambling den called a casino.
If I hadn't become a sailor, I'd have made my fortune there.
I see.
Commander, may I ask you a question?
I boarded your plane, I guess I have to answer you.
What?
As a man from Nagaoka, I can understand Kawai's spirit of study.
Indeed...
Always remember the debt to the Shogunate and fight to the bitter end.
But the Shogunate ended years ago.
What are we to feel indebted to today?
To our parents who gave birth to us.
And our birthplace which nurtured their lives.
In other words, our country.
It means we must labour for Japan.
Yes, Sir.
Excuse me.
Yes.
I've brought Admiral Nagumo.
I'm assuming my new duties.
Through strenuous efforts, I will execute my duties.
Right.
It's been a while.
Care to stay for supper?
No, I must return to my new duties on the Akagi.
I see.
In other words, Nagumo commands the No. 1 Aircraft Carrier Fleet, while commanding the combat planes on the Akagi and the Kaga.
While Yamaguchi commands the No. 2 Aircraft Carrier Fleet.
The Navy made a radical personnel assignment.
is there a problem?
Nagumo is a pure "fleet faction" man who pushed hard to expand the fleet.
He's the one who shoved Hori, a "treaty faction" man, into early retirement.
Oh, Vice Admiral Hori, renowned as a rare talent that could lead the Navy.
And Hori was Yamamoto's classmate and his closest friend.
There is no way that Yamamoto and Nagumo will get along.
Commander Yamamoto has it rough with Nagumo in charge of his combat planes.
Indeed.
Hello, political desk.
Germany voided its non-aggression pact with the Soviets!
What!
Turn the radio on.
...is advancing to the Eastern Front.
I repeat.
Early yesterday, Germany announced it is voiding its non-aggression pact.
Nazi military forces are marching to the Eastern Front, heading for Moscow.
With the sudden Germany/Soviet conflict, Munakata couldn't leave the office, so I took the liberty of coming in his stead.
The bus seems to be racing in an unexpected direction.
The route is somewhat off course, but as Munakata writes in his editorials, if Germany manages to crush the Soviets, our greatest northern threat disappears.
This bus has no choice but to keep running.
How far will it run?
What?
I'm asking, what is its destination?
The Great East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere.
If there really is such a place, I'd sure like to visit it once.
The job of a newspaper is to witness and listen to new global developments and convey them widely.
Open wide your eyes, your ears and your heart when you look around the world.
That's the duty of those who shoulder the next generation, Shindo.
War Records of Imperial Japan.
Attack on Franco-lndonesia.
In July, 1941 , in order to secure natural resources, the Imperial Navy finally invaded the French colony of Indonesia.
To retaliate, America stopped all exports of steel, oil and other essential resources to Japan...
Relations between Japan and America have now become extremely volatile.
In the unlikely event we go to war against America and England, how will we be able to end hostilities?
Prime Minister, it's true that America is a powerful nation.
Even if we do win a decisive victory at sea, they will not easily surrender and we must anticipate a long war.
But if Germany wins decisively over Europe and the Soviets,
American public opinion will change dramatically, and there is the possibility that it will end the war.
Possibility?
A battle must be fought to know its outcome.
Finally made it in under 15 minutes.
On our ship, Hiryu, we'll clock even shorter times.
It's you, Yamaguchi.
I heard you were inspecting the combat squadrons and arrived to assist you.
Liar, you just want to eat the Navy's best chow, here on the Nagato.
There's that, too.
Can it not be stopped?
It seems not.
Since when did the Navy start to favour battle?
I wonder...
A soldier must follow orders, but...
By the time you command this fleet, the Navy will change.
No, I believe you are the commander who will change the Navy.
Too slow!
Sixty seconds between descending planes.
Saeki, don't look at your altimeter!
Eyeball it!
Sir!
Makino!
Commander!
Your squadron leader is from Nagaoka.
I bet he's tough!
Sir!
Where are you from?
Sir, I'm from Kagoshima!
Yamaguchi!
From Satsuma and Choshu!
The future of Japan rests on your shoulders!
Work hard!
Yes, Sir!
Nagaoka, Satsuma and Choshu!
Work together to defend Japan!
Yes, Sir!
Special edition!
Tojo's Prime Minister!
Give me one.
Two pence.
We keep getting new prime ministers.
We've had nine in five years.
That's good.
We finally have an Army general as prime minister.
Finally, Japan's going to war.
But can we really beat America?
First, it was the Mongols, then the Chinese, the Russians and the Great War.
When Japan fights a foreign war, we always win!
The country may win, but people still die.
My nephew died in China last year.
They haven't even sent his bones home.
"Navy representative to the London Naval Treaty negotiations..."
Here.
Thanks.
Still researching Yamamoto?
Yes.
We fought China when he was 10, Russia when he was 20.
He graduated naval academy in time for the Battle of Tsushima.
He lost two fingers from his left hand from Russian cannon fire.
So Yamamoto was the first sailor the Navy commended for being wounded.
The Great War at 30, the Manchurian Incident at 47, war starts with China at 53, and when he becomes Fleet Commander at 55 war breaks out in Europe on the very next day.
The path of Yamamoto's life is in itself Imperial Japan's War Record.
"Navy Orders No. 1 .
"Orders to Fleet Commander Yamamoto.
"First, in order to defend itself, our empire
"will make all strategic preparations necessary
"to attack America, England and Holland in early December.
"Second, the Fleet Commander
"will implement all strategic preparations..."
It's the midsummer festival
Time for eggplant rice pot
I burned the tip of my nose licking up every scrap... I find it pathetic that this is my ordered fate.
It's too late to lay blame at anyone's feet.
My current position, in which I must resolve to violate all my personal convictions as I work without distractions is very odd indeed...
This is part of my fate.
Fate is cruel.
Excuse me.
The outline of the strategy is ready.
PEARL HARBOR ATTACK PLANS
Right.
The giant force will consist of six aircraft carriers and 350 carrier-based aeroplanes.
It will converge in the bay of Eto Island and head east across the Pacific.
Then it will head due south to 200 naval miles off Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.
The carrier-based planes will attack Pearl Harbor with torpedoes, horizontal bombing and dive-bombing.
It will destroy America's Pacific fleet, anchoring at port.
But aren't the seas of the Northern Pacific dangerously rough in winter?
- That is what the enemy assumes.
- What about re-supplies?
We are currently improving plans for re-supplying at sea.
There are problems with the attack.
Pearl Harbor bay is only 12 metres deep.
If we drop torpedoes, they'll hit the ocean floor.
We're adapting our torpedoes to compensate.
This is too big a gamble!
We stick with the command's strategy, attacking the southern oilfields first!
What if enemy planes start bombing the Japanese homeland, while we're focused on the southern oilfields?
That's...
This strategy is not a gamble.
If we have to go to war with America, we have to destroy their carriers first.
If we free up their mobile units, they'll stage an airbase near Tokyo.
Japan's skies will become vulnerable.
America is currently building 200 warships.
Compared to them, we can only build 30 in the next three years.
If we have no choice but to fight them, we attack first, prepared for annihilation.
We ferociously attack their main fleet, pummelling the American Navy and the American will to fight
with the vigour of our fighting spirit and then immediately sue for peace.
Early peace.
There is no other path to Japan's survival.
Even if we die upon each other's sword, we must destroy the enemy's jewels.
If this should fail, our country will perish.
The Hawaii plan represents my conviction.
ministry OF THE NAVY
Yamamoto's talking about preparing for annihilation, but a war with America will be long.
Nagumo, return with my fleet intact.
Don't let a single ship sink.
Yes, Sir.
Hello.
Thanks for your business.
Welcome home.
What's that, snapper?
Mother ordered it after you called.
Where is she?
She's sick in bed, with a bad cold.
Oh, I see.
One, two, one, two... I'm so sorry.
Do you have a fever?
I'm over it now.
Let us eat.
Thanks for the food.
Stay in bed.
No...
When I graduated artillery school, the Meiji Emperor gave this to me.
The coded telegram fixing the date of this strategy is,
"Nii Takayama Nobore."
However, if the on-going negotiations in Washington reach agreement, even after the planes have taken off from their carrier, they must turn back.
That's impossible.
They can't turn back with the enemy in their sights.
The men won't stand for it.
What do you think is the reason we foster and train our soldiers?
It is solely to defend our nation's peace!
If an officer believes he cannot turn back after receiving this order, I forbid your deployment.
Submit your resignation, now!
Also, in the unlikely event that we must go to war, you shall not bomb civilian residential areas.
Drill that into your guts.
Commander, about the plan to storm the bay with miniature submarines?
Can they safely accommodate the crews?
No, not yet... ln that case, I can't approve that plan.
I can tolerate desperate plans but not one with no chance of survival.
I understand.
Please confirm with Military Command.
In the event we go to war, make sure to send a final warning to America.
They must swear to send this.
Yes.
When Japanese samurai strike an enemy at night, at least they kick his pillow
to awaken him first.
If we attack before a final warning is delivered, the Japanese Navy's name will be ruined.
December 8th, 1941 .
The giant attack force of 350 planes taking off from six aircraft carriers attacked the American Pacific fleet anchored at Pearl Harbor.
This raised the curtain on the Pacific War.
I can see the fleet.
All planes attack!
Enemy planes, Sir!
Ready.
Ready!
Sir, there are no carriers!
No.
There aren't.
Telegram from Hawaii.
"Tora Tora Tora!
Surprise attack succeeds!"
Officer Fujii.
I know I repeat myself, but make sure to confirm they delivered the declaration of war.
Yes, Sir.
Squadron leader!
Oh, you're well.
Yes!
Where's Saeki?
He's not back yet.
He should be soon...
We sighted no carriers in the bay.
We couldn't attack their fuel tanks.
Please let us make a second attack.
I report!
From Commander Yamaguchi of the No. 2 Carrier Fleet.
"l confirm the need for a second attack!" That's all.
Commander.
No answer from the Akagi.
Shall we try again?
No...
Nagumo probably won't.
The Arizona is badly damaged, the Pennsylvania has minor damage, the Nevada nearly sunk, the California sunk four battleships sunk, four battleships destroyed.
America's Pacific fleet is demolished.
No...
They are unhurt.
Their carriers are all unhurt.
Commander, we need to deliver the finishing blow.
Returning all our ships unhurt is part of our duty.
But...
We exit strategic waters now.
All ships turn around and return to port.
They turned around?
What are the mobile units doing?
Commander, let's attack them again.
- That would be an ill-advised attack.
- All attacks are ill-advised!
The goal of this plan is to destroy the enemy fleet, even risking our safety.
However...
Let us abide by Nagumo's judgement.
Commander!
There must be something we can't see from here in Japanese waters.
Listen...
Even robbers are scared to walk home.
He never made it back.
I see!
Every ship in the mobile unit fleet was unhurt.
Yes, there was no damage to any ship.
A battle must be fought to know its outcome.
Cheers!
Fleet Commander Yamamoto, Banzai!
Roosevelt's speech is on.
The Foreign Ministry definitely instructed the Japanese ambassador in Washington to deliver the declaration 30 minutes before the Pearl Harbor attack.
The Embassy staff must have mismanaged...
Mismanaged!
Mismanaged what?
I don't know the details, but ultimately the declaration wasn't delivered until one hour after our attack.
Perhaps the Embassy took more time to translate the Ministry's cable...
Took more time!
Do you mock me?
Does anyone in the Ministry or Military Command understand what this means?
Why did Commander Yamamoto stress...
Officer Miyake.
Sir.
Let's start.
What?
This will be a tough fight.
There.
Commander Yamamoto, we wish you a happy New Year!
Please make another lightning charge this year.
Wonderful, the economy will finally improve.
I can't remember such a refreshing New Year's!
Imperial fleet, Banzai!
Banzai!
Happy New Year.
Incredible.
He used to badmouth the Navy so much.
That ended with last year.
Oh, happy New Year!
Dear iso, happy New Year I know you must be working so very hard.
Nagaoka is all wrapped up in a white blanket of snow.
These days, my neighbours stop by nearly every day to talk about you.
They say you're a hero who saved our nation, and they pray every time they hear your name on the radio.
I know you hate that sort of thing more than anyone, but everyone is just so very proud of you that, as your sister, I just listen to them gratefully.
When springtime comes, I'll send you more sweets.
Please look forward to them.
Imperial Military Command announces that on February 1 5th, the British military surrenders on the island of Singapore...
We smashed their Oriental fleet and now Singapore has fallen.
Two months into this war, we are invincible.
The oil in Borneo is ours!
Editor!
Another run of the special edition!
Not since we went to war with China!
Our circulation will increase, too!
Where was that...
You ate 50 tangerines...
Not that many, only 47.
That was in Yugawara.
Pearl Harbor was a failure.
Yeah, a huge failure.
Not a single carrier in sight...
The Yankee spirit is in flames at the sneak attack.
Now they've got a righteous cause against Japan.
But our people are in seventh heaven.
You tried to evade war for them, but they want to go to war.
No doubt they think that wars happen far across the sea.
If the day comes when bombs rain down from the sky, this country will suffer.
You're going after them, one more time?
Yeah, we'll go after Hawaii again.
It won't take America six months to get back on its feet.
Before then, I'll smash their carriers and capture Hawaii.
That's the only way to sue for peace.
But if you bring up suing for peace in these invincible times, the people will faint from shock.
To this country, you're as almighty as God.
If I were God, I wouldn't start a war in the first place.
Admiral Yamamoto, I thank you on behalf of the Japanese people!
Have a seat.
Your victory instantly swept aside the dark clouds oppressing this nation.
You have managed to take revenge for the hardships and humiliations we've tasted since the Black Ships.
America will withdraw from China and Asia will fall into our hands.
Please tell us today about your vision towards final victory.
Sue for peace.
Sue for peace?
The soldier's most important duty is to finish the war he starts.
I'm truly shocked.
You have no idea what the people want now.
What public opinion expects now!
Regardless of public opinion, this country must not be destroyed.
I've wasted my time.
I can't print this as an article.
Excuse me.
You see...
Yes?
No, thank you for your earlier hospitality.
Take a good look at the world around you.
Got that, Shindo?
Yes.
The Yamato is big.
I can't seem to settle down.
Makes me want to hit the town.
Thank you!
SWEETS
That's all you're eating?
Better say what's on your mind.
The Military Command plans to expand the war.
They seem drunk on the initial victories.
Go ahead, eat.
Little girl.
Yes.
Can I have another bowl of sweet soup?
Yes.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
She's just...
No, no, the fault is mine.
I surprised you.
I was reckless when I was young and got hurt.
Now, more sweet soup, please.
Yes.
Thank you so much.
The plan is prepared.
midway STRATEGY PLAN
This will definitely draw out the carriers.
We'll smash them and capture Hawaii.
Military Command thinks Americans will be based in Australia and come north over the islands to invade Japan.
So they plan to capture Fiji and Samoa to stop their northern advances.
Can our fleet deploy so far?
Apparently the Fleet Commander is still targeting Hawaii.
I see, so the Navy has more than one mind.
Hayakawa, you stay on the Navy Ministry.
The rest of you keep your ears peeled for information from all sources.
This is totally different from Pearl Harbor.
What?
Before that attack, no one leaked any information.
Did we have an air raid drill scheduled today?
Tokyo bombed?
They flew mid-sized bombers from their carriers.
They've staged an airbase near Tokyo...
Fly the No. 1 Carrier Fleet combat squadron to Atsugi to defend Tokyo!
Yes, Sir!
It was a pitiful sight.
So, this is an air raid.
In order to prevent future air raids, the Army, responsible for homeland defence, is demanding that we push the Pacific frontline farther east.
Therefore, I have approved the Midway Plan.
Yes, Sir.
I hear Yamamoto is saying the goal is to lure their aircraft carriers, but the real goal is to capture the Midway Islands.
The priority is to capture it to create a frontline base.
Got that, Nagumo?
Yes, Sir.
We'll destroy the enemy's airbase and land assault troops.
After, we quickly occupy the island.
At the same time, our carriers will standby between Hawaii and Midway.
We'll wait for the enemy aircraft carriers that will surely be lured, and use all our strength to annihilate them.
According to Military Command, capturing the island is their priority.
No, capturing Midway and luring their aircraft carriers are both goals.
The enemy carriers were hard hit in the battle at Coral Sea, two weeks ago.
They won't take the bait.
Even if they do, they're nothing to fear.
What's your evidence?
What?
What evidence do you have that they're nothing to fear?
Well, that's...
Even in Hawaii, which Military Command considers a resounding victory, we lost 55 of our best trained flight crew.
From now on, America won't let us surprise them with any more attacks.
For an officer to assert that the enemy is nothing to fear, is the height of insecurity.
Sir, I apologise.
For the Pacific fleet in Hawaii, Midway is a treasured forward airbase.
If we hammer it, their carriers have to come.
Nagumo.
Yes.
To prepare for their aircraft carriers, load half of the Akagi's fighters with torpedoes and have them standing by.
Understood.
The goal of this plan is to lure the enemy carriers and annihilate them.
No matter what the cost, we cannot ever let enemy planes fly in Japanese skies.
May 27th, 1942.
The battleship Yamato, helmed by Yamamoto, followed Nagumo's Akagi to Midway, joining a giant attack fleet of over 200 ships.
You haven't gotten a raise in pay this past year, have you, Miyake?
Sir...
You went on the attack.
You'll get a bonus next month.
Sir... lf we had stayed in the Inland Sea, I couldn't give you bonuses or medals.
The military is a complicated business...
Don't you need to load torpedoes onto half of our fighters?
The enemy carriers will never come.
So we don't need to arm torpedoes.
Bombs for capturing Midway are all we need.
Forward at half speed.
I can smell 'em.
There are carriers.
I report.
Our submarines off of Kwajalein Atoll report intercepting enemy carrier signals.
Read it!
The enemy carrier position is 1 70 sea miles north-north-west of Midway.
I knew they'd come.
Officer, don't you need to let the Akagi know, too?
No, the Akagi should have also received it.
And we're in radio silence.
If we send a cable, the enemy may be able to identify our position.
Right...
Midway Islands, 30 degrees to right.
All planes attack!
Sir, there are no planes on their runway!
They were ready...
Officer, are you sure there are no enemy carriers?
Yes, our six reconnaissance planes have found nothing and the carriers won't come here.
You don't need to worry.
According to reports, the weather near Midway will dramatically improve.
When the clouds clear,
Nagumo will be totally exposed.
Officer Miyake.
Time for a game.
I report!
The first attack squad reports "Bombing results inadequate.
Second attack on Midway required."
That's all.
An Army detachment of 2,000 men are approaching the island.
If they don't all land safely, the Navy's reputation is at stake.
We must launch a second attack immediately.
Emergency report from plane four!
Discovered enemy carrier!
What?
Bearing 10 degrees from Midway, 240 sea miles, 150 degrees course, 20 knots!
That's all.
Distance from mother ship?
Roger.
Let's send the second attack against the enemy carrier.
No, they're only carrying bombs for Midway.
We can blast open their decks.
Why are our fighter planes in the air?
They have to land on our deck to refuel.
We can't afford to.
They can't attack without support!
They're late.
Communications.
Signal the Akagi!
"Approve immediate second attack."
Yes.
Enemy planes estimated arrival, 05:15, in 30 minutes.
Don't panic.
We can deploy all planes in 15 minutes.
Commander...
Bring in the escort planes.
Refit the second attack squadron with torpedoes.
Hurry!
Sir!
Okay, this way!
I'm going down first.
Roger!
Any response from the Akagi?
Nothing.
Less than 20 minutes to enemy planes.
Second attack squadron ready for take-off.
All planes take off!
Enemy planes in five minutes!
Enemy planes!
Overhead!
Dive-bombing!
Full starboard!
This carrier will attack their carriers.
Signal battle command.
I hereby take over command of the air battle.
Sir.
Listen well.
We will sink one enemy carrier if it costs our lives.
At this rate, the Imperial Navy will be an eternal laughing stock.
Yes, Sir!
4.2 east-south-east...
I will confirm.
Excuse me!
Cable from the Hiryu!
Akagi, Kaga and Soryu, bombed and on fire.
Hiryu is attacking the carriers alone.
They got three of our ships.
Where are the escort squadrons?
Arima!
Enemy planes!
Overhead!
Dive-bombing!
Full starboard!
You all fought hard to the end!
I'm grateful to you!
There's a long war still ahead.
Survive...
Survive!
And put this experience to work, to create a strong Navy!
Go!
Commander!
Get off now!
Commander!
Commander!
Please abandon ship!
Just go now.
They sank four of our carriers.
Someone has to stay behind.
I will stay, too!
I will, too!
I'm plenty.
Hurry, go!
Commander!
A keepsake.
Enough...
Go.
Excuse me.
I report.
After sinking the carrier Yorktown, the Hiryu was set ablaze and sank.
So that's it.
They got the Hiryu.
Also, Commander Yamaguchi went down with the ship.
It's over now...
Let's attack them at night!
We'll never catch up.
And at first light, we'll become a target subjecting the flagship to the enemy's bombs!
I know that, Sir!
This is the second time, following Hawaii.
We can't limp back to port like this.
We can't take the commander back to Japan under these pathetic conditions!
Kuroshima...
Sir!
Enough.
Let's go home to Japan.
Excuse me!
Commander Nagumo is aboard.
Right.
Miyake.
Sir.
Don't blame Nagumo.
I apologise for this outcome.
Eat your rice soup while it's hot.
"American carriers sunk!"
"120 planes attack!"
The Imperial Navy does it again!
Why aren't there any pictures?
There were huge pictures when Singapore fell.
Yeah.
All sinking enemy ships look the same.
Really?
"Our fleet losses were minor."
But a single ship carries hundreds of sailors.
They went down with the ship.
That's just how warfare is...
Good evening.
You were closed today.
You're the man... I'm so sorry.
Without sugar or beans since the rations, we had to close... I see... I'll come back again.
Oh, right.
I'm sorry for scaring you the other day.
My apologies.
It will suit you.
In the waters off Guadalcanal of the Solomon Islands, our imperial Navy, launched a huge attack, sinking two enemy aircraft carriers...
Despite its great victory at Midway, the Imperial Navy abandoned its plans to capture Hawaii.
Instead, according to their original plans, built an airbase on Guadalcanal, to destroy the invading Americans, heading north, on their way to fortify Australia.
Many Army officers were deployed.
The Imperial Fleet's Command and the flagship Yamato headed south anchoring near Truk Island on the equator.
There's oil on Borneo, but with our tankers getting sunk like this...
No doubt things on Guadalcanal are nightmarish.
They were occupied three months ago.
Never expected the Americans would counterattack so quickly...
Yamamoto saw it coming.
It was the military bureaucrats in command who have no idea...
They always reason so as to match their foregone conclusions.
They don't have a shred of evidence.
I'm sure Yamamoto has it rough out there.
It should have been Singapore.
We missed our chance to sue for peace.
We may have been mistaken...
But still,
Yamamoto hasn't given up.
No matter what, I'm sure he's trying to somehow sue for peace...
You're right.
Yamamoto never gives up...
Over four days, they hammered our 1 1 battleships, including Kongo, Haruna, Jujun, Aoba and Chokai, with 3,000 shells and completely destroyed our airfield on Guadalcanal.
But the enemy is deploying incredible numbers of reinforcements.
It won't take them long to rebuild the airfield.
What's the condition of the Army?
Following the annihilation of the detachment that landed in August, the 5,000 troops under Kawaguchi's command are already destroyed...
This was the Navy's plan...
We must do something, but...
What?
Excuse me.
It's been a while.
You'll be at the Naval Academy... I hear you strongly recommended me as director of the Naval Academy.
Really?
I don't think it's right to go home to Japan at a time like this.
Inoue...
Yes.
The academy needs you now more than ever.
What?
If the worst should happen, the young must rebuild our nation.
Train the young.
You can do it.
Just like you once saved the Navy... lt's in your hands.
Yes, Sir.
Our landed troops have run out of food and ammunition.
At this rate, our troops remaining on the island will be annihilated.
The Imperial Fleet still has the Mutsu and the Nagato.
It also has this ship the Yamato, the mightiest in the world.
If we don't fire our big guns now, when do we?
But listen, Kadokura...
We should gather the full fleet for a final massive attack!
Commander Kadokura, excuse me, but we wish for that, too.
Why don't you?
-But...
-But, what?
In truth...
We don't have the fuel.
We will retreat from Guadalcanal.
But the Navy has a responsibility to the Army.
We mobilise every destroyer to rescue as many troops off Guadalcanal as we can.
I'll notify Central Command.
I'll make sure this plan of retreat succeeds...
Commander... ln that case, allow me to escort the destroyers.
Understood.
It's in your hands.
In the three days of strategic retreat, we rescued over 10,000 Army and Navy men.
I see.
But during his command,
Commander Kadokura was killed in battle.
Make sure his family receives his personal effects.
Yes, Sir.
From Imperial Headquarters.
In order to accomplish their mission, the troops fighting on Guadalcanal have been transferred off the island.
Transferred?
Editor, what exactly does "transferred" mean?
It means to proceed elsewhere.
In actuality, doesn't that mean retreat?
Elite Army and Navy troops secured a strategic base on the Solomons.
Therefore, they head to New Guinea, their original goal...
What else is that but a transfer?
Chief.
The public is realising that Midway was a disastrous defeat.
Isn't our mission to convey the truth to the public?
The mission of our newspapers is to stay ahead of the people and guide their will, even as Japan constructs a new world order.
We report our military's glorious exploits and keep spirits high at home!
Isn't that what's needed?
is that really our mission?
Shindo.
Right now, every citizen, is fighting together... ls fighting together!
I'll finish the editorial in two hours.
Okay!
We'll lead with,
"Our elite troops transfer from Guadalcanal."
Yes.
Tell the copydesk.
Yes, I will.
congratulations TO OUR DRAFTEES
April, 1943.
The Imperial Fleet moved its Command to Rabaul, to concentrate its aviator strength.
The newspaper is increasingly filled with "transfers".
One and a half years into this war, I fear we are headed for a war of attrition, like the war we're fighting against China.
But no one dares say it out loud.
Imperial FLEET COMMAND RABAUL
SAEKl
ARlMA
YAMAGUCHl
KADOKURA
One year and four months into this war, you've all fought hard in tough conditions.
But enemy attacks grow stronger every day.
The Imperial Fleet will now conduct its final battle.
First, we'll consolidate the Rabaul-based air squadrons with all the aircraft carriers in the Third Fleet.
Then we'll annihilate the enemy aviators deployed in the Solomon-New Guinea area.
After that...
We'll immediately reduce our front line.
Are we transferring?
No, it's a retreat.
Words must be used accurately.
We pull back to the Marianas.
We use Guam and Saipan as an unsinkable carrier and fight our final air battle.
With that victory,
we sue for peace...
However, if we retreat our front line, the enemy will launch an all-out attack there.
I didn't say we pull back everything.
We'll keep the front line bases until the rear is prepared.
What about the troops...
Yes, they'll be sacrificed.
It's the final battle, to sue for peace.
Okay, return to base!
Roger!
Mother...
Today, the Igo Plan has ended.
It was a rare victory.
We can now head to the Marianas.
Yes.
Commander.
Lt. Makino died in combat.
I see...
Makino's gone, too...
Chief of Staff, I'll inspect the front lines on the 18th, too.
No, there are daily enemy attacks on those bases.
You cannot accompany us there.
Mine may be an ugly face, but the troops are happy to see it.
I'm grateful.
Your humble servant has so many of his dear men divided in this world and the next.
I both want them to welcome me there and remain here to serve on earth a little longer... I am of two minds, but have one body.
Come in.
Excuse me.
What's that scary look for?
Commander Ozawa is insisting that you must not inspect the front lines.
But if you insist, he'll fly as many escort planes as you wish.
Just the usual, please.
Don't blow it out of proportion.
But, Sir...
The usual is fine.
Listen, Miyake.
Sir.
A lot of young men have died.
Japan's youth, who shoulder the future, are all dying first.
I'm an old man, still sticking around...
When I see them again,
how am I supposed to greet them?
What's a man to do...
Come in.
Excuse me.
What is it?
I've been drafted into the infantry.
I see.
Akiyama will take over the Imperial War Record.
I understand.
Thank you for everything.
Fight the good fight for your country, Japan.
Yes.
Shindo... I'll be off.
Hey!
You'll get malaria from the mosquitoes!
Excuse me.
Don't act so shocked.
Even I have a glass of whisky now and then.
It's the midsummer festival I burned the tip of my nose...
Hey, hey, what's that?
I memorised it.
Don't screw it up.
All right, I'll teach you the correct lyrics.
It's the midsummer festival
Time for eggplant rice pot
I burned the tip of my nose
Licking up every scrap I burned the tip of my nose
Licking up every scrap
How dare you signal the commander's movements!
What if the enemy intercepts it?
We land at the base on Ballale in 15 minutes.
Right.
Enemy planes!
Emergency landing!
Commander!
After pondering the general trends of the world and the actual conditions in our empire today, we have decided to effect a settlement of the present situation by resorting to an extraordinary measure.
We have ordered our government to communicate to the U.S., Great Britain, China, and the Soviet Union, that our empire accepts the provisions of theirjoint declaration...
Admiral Yamamoto, it's been two years and four months since you died.
And so, the war ended in a manner far removed from the peace you so desired.
Since the war began in Pearl Harbor, some three million have lost their lives to it.
Over 90% of those lives were lost after you died.
After you died on Bougainville, there was no one left in Japan, who could bring the war to an end.
When and how did we go wrong?
And what did we lose?
We will abandon our past, and create a new Japan with America.
This is our greatest mission for the future!
Okay, that's the editorial!
The answer to that may have to wait 50 or 100 years...
Put this word "Democratize" in the biggest font!
Yes.
But that may also be enough time for the people of our country to forget everything.
Imperial WAR RECORD
But Admiral Yamamoto, that you, who opposed the war above all others, were forced to light its fire...
And that you fought all your battles to restore peace as soon as possible...
These facts, I will always remember.
WAR RECORD OF Imperial JAPAN BY SHlNDO
Admiral Yamamoto, I believe we must start over by really looking at the world.
Following your words, by opening our eyes, our ears and our hearts.

Hey, Iso.
At the time of the Boshin Civil War, your grandfather was already 77 years old.
But he bravely charged the enemy.
He died a glorious death.
Our city, Nagaoka, burned for three days and nights.
The whole city burned to ashes.
It was a horrible sight to behold.
That was 20 years ago.
Time does fly...
THE ADMIRAL (ADMIRAL YAMAMOTO)
DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY
Company, halt!
Left turn!
Take aim!
What the hell are you up to!
How dare you aim at the Navy!
How dare you!
Withdraw!
If the Army wants a fight, let us be prepared!
Hurry to the generators!
If they cut off our water and power, 3,000 men won't be able to flush!
Withdraw!
At ease!
Company, advance!
Yes.
Excuse me.
I've ordered a Yokosuka land battalion to stand by.
I see.
The Army is insolent!
To conclude the Tripartite Pact, they're even threatening a coup d'état.
That was a real scare.
I thought they'd really shoot.
The Army and Navy shooting at each other is no joking matter.
But I trust all is well, Yamamoto?
Yes.
With General Inoue in charge, things will be fine.
Right.
I'll excuse myself, then.
Minister.
Please make no scandalous detours on your way home today.
Right.
Only because you insist.
He'll detour.
Yes, a detour is written all over his face.
Excuse me.
Undersecretary, Chief Editor Munakata of Tokyo Nippo is here.
Oh, it's that time already?
I leave you in charge.
Shindo here was completely panicked that a battle was about to start.
At this rate, we could repeat the tragedy of the February 26 coup from three years ago.
Undersecretary, you should look after your own personal safety.
I appreciate your concern.
Even with things in this state, will the Navy still oppose the Tripartite Pact?
Yes, of course.
Is your reason America?
If we side with Germany, America won't sit still.
Which country stole land from our countrymen with their discriminatory law?
America.
And proposed the League of Nations but refuses to join over the Monroe Doctrine?
America.
On top of that, expands their own colonies, but refuses to acknowledge our rightful national interests in Asia?
As you say.
Why wouldn't you try to sweep aside such a country?
Can you sweep them aside?
It's true.
Their shipbuilding capacity is 4.5 times ours.
For aeroplanes, six times, for cars, 100 times.
For oil, 700 times ours.
In half a day, they produce Japan's annual consumption.
In national strength, America is 10 times stronger than Japan.
Your understanding is correct.
But in the Russo-Japanese war, we beat Russia, also 10 times our might, right?
At the time, Russia was undergoing a revolution.
Thus, we could sue for peace after one victorious battle.
But today, wars are total wars.
It will not end until one side has burned to ashes.
So we should shut up and do America's bidding?
No.
We must boldly assert our nation's conditions and confront our opponents without fear.
But that, should be handled by diplomacy.
That is my point.
Your point is well taken.
But the last resort of diplomacy is war...
Is it not?
Listen, Mr Munakata, once you start a war, there's no turning back.
We must not bring catastrophe upon our nation by charging without sober deliberation.
So we must grin and bear it?
Even if our people are smothered by this gloomy helplessness?
Isn't it you, who are fanning the flames of this helplessness you refer to?
The newspapers simply represent public opinion.
This public opinion, is it truly the voice of the people?
Right.
Welcome back!
- Shindo, Shindo!
- Yes!
Did you get Undersecretary Yamamoto?
The chief is in his room.
Okay!
He'll write the editorial in time.
Akiyama!
What was Undersecretary Yamamoto like?
He's a mysterious man.
But it's clear the Tripartite Pact is a long way off.
Internally, the Navy is still fighting the Boshin War.
The Boshin War?
The Navy's inner circle come from Satsuma and Choshu clans.
But the minister and the general come from Morioka and Sendai.
And the Undersecretary comes from Nagaoka.
They all fought Satsuma and Choshu.
I see, of course they'll clash.
WAR RECORDS OF IMPERIAL JAPAN
War Records of Imperial Japan.
In 1868, even as the Boshin Civil War raged, our nation entered the new Meiji era, and based on twin victories over Russia and China, grew to be counted among the world's five great nations.
And the Great War, which erupted in the Taisho era, brought our nation unprecedented prosperity.
But as the Showa era dawned, the great depression stormed Japan.
Advancing on Manchuria was Japan's solution.
Ever since, our conflict with China intensified and over the course of seven years of localized combat, domestically, Japan witnessed three major military coups d'états, spreading social anxiety.
On July 7th, 1937, war with China erupts.
Japan and China are finally in full-scale war.
The Army believed it would win in one month, but the Soviet Union, England, and America all aided Chiang Kai-shek's government and the fighting bogged down.
That was when Germany, under command of Hitler, asked Japan to join the Tripartite Pact with Italy.
For Japan, bogged down in China, it was an extremely attractive offer.
The Japanese people were in a frenzy over Germany's ferocious military advance over Europe.
But despite an avalanche of support for the Tripartite Pact, the Navy's sole opposition managed to prevent its conclusion.
"...to join forces with our German ally,
"to liberate Asia from the grip of the Euro-American powers,
"in order to build the New East Asian Order,
"now is the time for the Navy to decisively support the Tripartite Pact.
"We fervently desire this."
All right, that's the editorial.
Submit this!
Yes!
Yes?
Political Desk.
Aborted assassination?
ASSASSINATION PLOT
UNDERSECRETARY YAMAMOTO TARGET
I demand that the Navy's Yonai, Yamamoto, and Inoue, who all advance
Britain and America's cause, by blocking the Tripartite Pact, so essential to Japanese policy today, all resign immediately!
The Military Police have offered protection.
The usual routine is fine.
The Army's Military Police scare me more.
But, Sir...
The usual routine is fine.
If my death awakens the Japanese people, so be it.
Totally inappropriate!
Don't twist things your way!
Isn't the Tripartite Pact necessary so that Germany can restrain the Soviet Union from invading south!
Incomprehensible!
Do you have any brains in your head?
Why the hell would Germany move to support Japan?
What!
Oh, Sir...
Are you all analysing international affairs?
These naval officers are worse than the Army.
Undersecretary, why do you not acknowledge the strength of our ally, Germany?
Our ally?
You're awfully devoted to Germany.
In that case, I presume you've read Hitler's Mein Kampf?
Every last page.
In other words, the Japanese are an inferior race, lacking in imagination, but they are skilful and clever and perfect for Germany to use!
I never read those words!
Of course not!
Because Chapter 11 in your edition is conveniently deleted!
Unfortunately, it seems an essential part was missing from the Japanese translation you men read.
If you don't trace things back to their source, you can overlook the essentials.
Enter.
Excuse me.
What?
Germany signed a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union.
Your ally has sided with our sworn enemy.
Prime Minister Hiranuma is dissolving the cabinet.
The signing of the non-aggression pact between Germany and the Soviet...
Hitler gave up on Japan because we dithered.
Farewell Tripartite Pact.
War with America will have to wait thanks to the cowards in the Navy.
- Welcome.
- All done with the show?
I'm so hungry.
Noodles please!
At least remove your stage makeup before filling your belly.
Nobody brings me snacks to my dressing room any more.
Not in this economy...
If they don't start a war soon, my factory will go bankrupt.
Say, if a war starts, will the economy really get better?
In the Great War, 20 years ago, the economy quickly recovered.
That's right, war is best.
We're already at war with China.
We can't start wars everywhere.
But it's America that's behind China.
So if we beat America, we can beat China, too.
Exactly!
YAMAMOTO PROMOTED TO FLEET COMMANDER
Six pence!
This one, too.
Minister, the Tripartite Pact negotiations ended, but none of the problems are solved.
Please let me remain and serve as Undersecretary.
But if you stay here in headquarters, you'll run out of lives.
Why don't you spend some time out at sea.
Hey, Inoue.
Thank you for your long service.
I'm grateful.
You forcefully pressured the Ministry into stopping the Tripartite Pact.
You saved the Navy.
No, I had my hands full reining in the youth.
Which left no time for constructive discussions about the future of Japan.
I'm disappointed.
Well...
In the fall, I'll be transferred to the China Sea fleet.
I had hoped that at least you would stay in the Ministry.
Admiral Yamamoto...
Thank you for everything.
Right, we'll meet again.
So you're the Fleet Commander.
You, who never aspired to fame or fortune.
You're unmatched in the Navy, Hori, and much more suited than me.
Won't you take my place?
I'm a civilian now.
They fired me five years ago.
"Fleet in being."
A nation's navy is always defending.
It exists to guarantee peace.
The non-combative fleet you kept lobbying for, is hard to realise.
The current Military Command knows nothing of war and neither do the military planners.
It's impossible to persuade them.
Hori...
Yeah?
Take my place?
It's been five years since I've been to sea.
September, 1939,
Yamamoto bid farewell to the Navy Ministry.
And he assumed his post as Fleet Commander on the flagship, Nagato, based on Hashira Island in the Inland Sea.
Just then, the blitzkrieg struck Europe.
Germany finally launched its attack against Poland.
In response, England and France declared war.
The peace in Europe did not even last 20 years, and eight months passed in this new Second World War.
Meanwhile, under Yamamoto's command, the Japanese fleet improved the performance of its aircraft carriers, vigorously training its carrier-based planes.
May, 1940,
Germany broke its inaction and began invading again.
Quickly conquering Belgium and Holland, in one month, it occupied Paris.
It was an overwhelming victory, a "blitzkrieg" in every sense.
As though in concert with Germany's blitzkrieg, voices called anew for the Tripartite Pact in Japan.
The Germans can't seem to be stopped.
Once our Yamato battleship is built, we'll be invincible.
Chief of Staff, the future belongs to aeroplanes.
We could build 1,000 planes for the price of one of your battleships.
Listen, the history of our Japanese Navy is built on battles at sea...
These Inland Sea sardines are tasty.
Yes.
Both of you hail from the Inland Sea area, don't you?
Yes.
I'm envious.
Your fish are tasty to the bone.
Where did you get these, the sweet dumplings!
Sweet dumplings?
Enter, Makino.
Excuse me.
I'm Ensign Makino, who served under you at Kasumigaura Air Corps.
I assumed my position on the Akagi's combat unit yesterday.
Good to hear.
Is this your doing?
Yes!
I was given leave and went home to Nagaoka.
They're my mother's homemade dumplings.
Try some.
Sugar on sweet dumplings?
That's right.
Is your mother well?
She is delighted that I will be working under your command.
Tasty.
Enjoy.
Thanks.
Saeki, your rear!
Oh, no, rats!
Great!
Victory!
Arima, stay focused on your rear!
Yes!
Always a battlefield?
Yes, it means endeavour in everything as though you are at war.
But the Nagaoka samurai have three principles.
Three?
The second is Kawai's spirit of duty.
Kawai fought to the bitter end, never forgetting his debt to the Shogunate.
- Tokugawa?
- Debt?
Yes.
Thirdly, the spirit of 100 bushels of rice.
One hundred bushels of rice?
Even after the battle was lost and our clansmen were starving, our clan clung to the gift of 100 bushels of rice, building a school with its profit.
When everyone was starving?
A hundred bushels of rice are gone if you eat them.
But if you spend it on people, it can grow to be 10,000 bushels.
If you are to lead men, always consider the future.
ALWAYS A BATTLEFIELD
100,000 men.
What?
We lost 100,000 men in the Russo-Japanese war.
But after 20 or 30 years, everyone quickly forgets.
The newspapers and the people.
Being good at forgetting is one of our people's strengths, as well.
- Please.
- I know.
In order to participate in Germany's new world economy, now is the time to conclude the Tripartite Pact.
We must not miss this bus...
The Tripartite Pact, is now an agreement between four nations, including the Soviet Union, and confronted with these four nations, even America will reconsider its disrespect.
We are done with the weak-willed Navy!
Now is the time to conclude the Tripartite Pact!
Don't miss the bus!
Listen, Navy Minister!
MINISTRY OF THE NAVY
I have only just taken Yoshida's place as Navy Minister, but political stagnation must not be permitted.
If the Navy persists in opposing the Tripartite Pact,
Konoe's cabinet will be forced to resign and we cannot be held to blame.
Therefore, I reluctantly propose that we revise our policy.
I hope that you officers will join my support for the Tripartite Pact.
Any objections?
Please wait.
I swear total allegiance to your command, Minister.
But I do have some concerns, so let me ask you, if the Tripartite Pact is concluded, the chances of a conflict with America increase.
Currently, our lack of aviators is apparent.
If we do go to war with America, we will need 1,000 fighter planes and 1,000 bombers.
In other words, we must double our current plane strength.
But our country relies on America for steel, oil and other manufacturing resources.
If we sign with Germany now, we will inevitably lose all of that.
In which case, how have you revised your plans, to compensate for that loss?
Please tell me.
We will await the future deliberations of each department...
Minister, that is not an answer.
Please tell me the reason why you think a war against America is possible.
I'm sure you have your opinions, but the majority is in favour, so...
Excuse me.
A telegram from the commander.
"Begin planning the attack."
I'm home!
Oh, my.
Welcome home.
Yes.
Thanks for the food.
Yoshimasa, pickles are for the end of the meal.
Yes.
Take a sip of miso soup before you eat rice.
What's most important is to clean your plate and eat your fill.
Yes.
Here, Yoshimasa.
Here.
Thank you.
Here, Sumi.
There you go.
Thank you.
Here, Ma.
Thank you.
Here, Tadao.
Thank you.
Here, Mother.
Thank you.
Commander Yamamoto, it seems we'll finally join the Tripartite Pact.
"The national defence
"is to provide requisite armed forces, but also to grow national strength,
"while using diplomacy to evade war.
"That is the essence of national defence.
"In other words,
"the national defence is not exclusive to soldiers..."
Those are the words of Admiral Kato, who, taking Japan's future into consideration, decided to sign the Washington Disarmament Treaty, limiting naval armaments.
The words of that notorious Prime Minister Kato who created the flip-flop cabinet.
September 27th, 1940.
The Tripartite Pact which shook our nation for three years, was finally concluded.
The bus Japan climbed on has taken off, engines gunning.
Who's in my plane?
Commander.
I wish this could fly to Monaco.
Excuse me, Sir!
There's a gambling den called a casino.
If I hadn't become a sailor, I'd have made my fortune there.
I see.
Commander, may I ask you a question?
I boarded your plane, I guess I have to answer you.
What?
As a man from Nagaoka, I can understand Kawai's spirit of study.
Indeed...
Always remember the debt to the Shogunate and fight to the bitter end.
But the Shogunate ended years ago.
What are we to feel indebted to today?
To our parents who gave birth to us.
And our birthplace which nurtured their lives.
In other words, our country.
It means we must labour for Japan.
Yes, Sir.
Excuse me.
Yes.
I've brought Admiral Nagumo.
I'm assuming my new duties.
Through strenuous efforts, I will execute my duties.
Right.
It's been a while.
Care to stay for supper?
No, I must return to my new duties on the Akagi.
I see.
In other words, Nagumo commands the No. 1 Aircraft Carrier Fleet, while commanding the combat planes on the Akagi and the Kaga.
While Yamaguchi commands the No. 2 Aircraft Carrier Fleet.
The Navy made a radical personnel assignment.
Is there a problem?
Nagumo is a pure "fleet faction" man who pushed hard to expand the fleet.
He's the one who shoved Hori, a "treaty faction" man, into early retirement.
Oh, Vice Admiral Hori, renowned as a rare talent that could lead the Navy.
And Hori was Yamamoto's classmate and his closest friend.
There is no way that Yamamoto and Nagumo will get along.
Commander Yamamoto has it rough with Nagumo in charge of his combat planes.
Indeed.
Hello, political desk.
Germany voided its non-aggression pact with the Soviets!
What!
Turn the radio on.
...is advancing to the Eastern Front.
I repeat.
Early yesterday, Germany announced it is voiding its non-aggression pact.
Nazi military forces are marching to the Eastern Front, heading for Moscow.
With the sudden Germany/Soviet conflict, Munakata couldn't leave the office, so I took the liberty of coming in his stead.
The bus seems to be racing in an unexpected direction.
The route is somewhat off course, but as Munakata writes in his editorials, if Germany manages to crush the Soviets, our greatest northern threat disappears.
This bus has no choice but to keep running.
How far will it run?
What?
I'm asking, what is its destination?
The Great East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere.
The Great East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere.
If there really is such a place, I'd sure like to visit it once.
The job of a newspaper is to witness and listen to new global developments and convey them widely.
Open wide your eyes, your ears and your heart when you look around the world.
That's the duty of those who shoulder the next generation, Shindo.
War Records of Imperial Japan.
Attack on Franco-Indonesia.
In July, 1941, in order to secure natural resources, the Imperial Navy finally invaded the French colony of Indonesia.
To retaliate, America stopped all exports of steel, oil and other essential resources to Japan...
Relations between Japan and America have now become extremely volatile.
In the unlikely event we go to war against America and England, how will we be able to end hostilities?
Prime Minister, it's true that America is a powerful nation.
Even if we do win a decisive victory at sea, they will not easily surrender and we must anticipate a long war.
But if Germany wins decisively over Europe and the Soviets,
American public opinion will change dramatically, and there is the possibility that it will end the war.
Possibility?
A battle must be fought to know its outcome.
Finally made it in under 15 minutes.
On our ship, Hiryu, we'll clock even shorter times.
It's you, Yamaguchi.
I heard you were inspecting the combat squadrons and arrived to assist you.
Liar, you just want to eat the Navy's best chow, here on the Nagato.
There's that, too.
Can it not be stopped?
It seems not.
Since when did the Navy start to favour battle?
I wonder...
A soldier must follow orders, but...
By the time you command this fleet, the Navy will change.
No, I believe you are the commander who will change the Navy.
Too slow!
Sixty seconds between descending planes.
Saeki, don't look at your altimeter!
Eyeball it!
Sir!
Makino!
Commander!
Your squadron leader is from Nagaoka.
I bet he's tough!
Sir!
Where are you from?
Sir, I'm from Kagoshima!
Yamaguchi!
From Satsuma and Choshu!
The future of Japan rests on your shoulders!
Work hard!
Yes, Sir!
Nagaoka, Satsuma and Choshu!
Work together to defend Japan!
Yes, Sir!
Special edition!
Tojo's Prime Minister!
Give me one.
Two pence.
We keep getting new prime ministers.
We've had nine in five years.
That's good.
We finally have an Army general as prime minister.
Finally, Japan's going to war.
But can we really beat America?
First, it was the Mongols, then the Chinese, the Russians and the Great War.
When Japan fights a foreign war, we always win!
The country may win, but people still die.
My nephew died in China last year.
They haven't even sent his bones home.
"Navy representative to the London Naval Treaty negotiations..."
Here.
Thanks.
Still researching Yamamoto?
Yes.
We fought China when he was 10, Russia when he was 20.
He graduated naval academy in time for the Battle of Tsushima.
He lost two fingers from his left hand from Russian cannon fire.
So Yamamoto was the first sailor the Navy commended for being wounded.
The Great War at 30, the Manchurian Incident at 47, war starts with China at 53, and when he becomes Fleet Commander at 55 war breaks out in Europe on the very next day.
The path of Yamamoto's life is in itself Imperial Japan's War Record.
"Navy Orders No. 1.
"Orders to Fleet Commander Yamamoto.
"First, in order to defend itself, our empire
"will make all strategic preparations necessary
"to attack America, England and Holland in early December.
"Second, the Fleet Commander
"will implement all strategic preparations..."
It's the midsummer festival
Time for eggplant rice pot
I burned the tip of my nose licking up every scrap...
I find it pathetic that this is my ordered fate.
It's too late to lay blame at anyone's feet.
My current position, in which I must resolve to violate all my personal convictions as I work without distractions is very odd indeed...
This is part of my fate.
Fate is cruel.
Excuse me.
The outline of the strategy is ready.
PEARL HARBOR ATTACK PLANS
Right.
The giant force will consist of six aircraft carriers and 350 carrier-based aeroplanes.
It will converge in the bay of Eto Island and head east across the Pacific.
Then it will head due south to 200 naval miles off Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.
The carrier-based planes will attack Pearl Harbor with torpedoes, horizontal bombing and dive-bombing.
It will destroy America's Pacific fleet, anchoring at port.
But aren't the seas of the Northern Pacific dangerously rough in winter?
- That is what the enemy assumes.
- What about re-supplies?
We are currently improving plans for re-supplying at sea.
There are problems with the attack.
Pearl Harbor bay is only 12 metres deep.
If we drop torpedoes, they'll hit the ocean floor.
We're adapting our torpedoes to compensate.
This is too big a gamble!
We stick with the command's strategy, attacking the southern oilfields first!
What if enemy planes start bombing the Japanese homeland, while we're focused on the southern oilfields?
That's...
This strategy is not a gamble.
If we have to go to war with America, we have to destroy their carriers first.
If we free up their mobile units, they'll stage an airbase near Tokyo.
Japan's skies will become vulnerable.
America is currently building 200 warships.
Compared to them, we can only build 30 in the next three years.
If we have no choice but to fight them, we attack first, prepared for annihilation.
We ferociously attack their main fleet, pummelling the American Navy and the American will to fight
with the vigour of our fighting spirit and then immediately sue for peace.
Early peace.
There is no other path to Japan's survival.
Even if we die upon each other's sword, we must destroy the enemy's jewels.
If this should fail, our country will perish.
The Hawaii plan represents my conviction.
MINISTRY OF THE NAVY
Yamamoto's talking about preparing for annihilation, but a war with America will be long.
Nagumo, return with my fleet intact.
Don't let a single ship sink.
Yes, Sir.
Hello.
Thanks for your business.
Welcome home.
What's that, snapper?
Mother ordered it after you called.
Where is she?
She's sick in bed, with a bad cold.
Oh, I see.
One, two, one, two...
I'm so sorry.
Do you have a fever?
I'm over it now.
Let us eat.
Thanks for the food.
Stay in bed.
No...
When I graduated artillery school, the Meiji Emperor gave this to me.
The coded telegram fixing the date of this strategy is,
"Nii Takayama Nobore."
However, if the on-going negotiations in Washington reach agreement, even after the planes have taken off from their carrier, they must turn back.
That's impossible.
They can't turn back with the enemy in their sights.
The men won't stand for it.
What do you think is the reason we foster and train our soldiers?
It is solely to defend our nation's peace!
If an officer believes he cannot turn back after receiving this order,
I forbid your deployment.
Submit your resignation, now!
Also, in the unlikely event that we must go to war, you shall not bomb civilian residential areas.
Drill that into your guts.
Commander, about the plan to storm the bay with miniature submarines?
Can they safely accommodate the crews?
No, not yet...
In that case, I can't approve that plan.
I can tolerate desperate plans but not one with no chance of survival.
I understand.
Please confirm with Military Command.
In the event we go to war, make sure to send a final warning to America.
They must swear to send this.
Yes.
When Japanese samurai strike an enemy at night, at least they kick his pillow
to awaken him first.
If we attack before a final warning is delivered, the Japanese Navy's name will be ruined.
December 8th, 1941.
The giant attack force of 350 planes taking off from six aircraft carriers attacked the American Pacific fleet anchored at Pearl Harbor.
This raised the curtain on the Pacific War.
I can see the fleet.
All planes attack!
Enemy planes, Sir!
Ready.
Ready!
Ready!
Sir, there are no carriers!
No.
There aren't.
Telegram from Hawaii.
"Tora Tora Tora!
Surprise attack succeeds!"
Officer Fujii.
I know I repeat myself, but make sure to confirm they delivered the declaration of war.
Yes, Sir.
Squadron leader!
Oh, you're well.
Yes!
Where's Saeki?
He's not back yet.
He should be soon...
We sighted no carriers in the bay.
We couldn't attack their fuel tanks.
Please let us make a second attack.
I report!
From Commander Yamaguchi of the No. 2 Carrier Fleet.
"I confirm the need for a second attack!" That's all.
Commander.
No answer from the Akagi.
Shall we try again?
No...
Nagumo probably won't.
The Arizona is badly damaged, the Pennsylvania has minor damage, the Nevada nearly sunk, the California sunk four battleships sunk, four battleships destroyed.
America's Pacific fleet is demolished.
No...
They are unhurt.
Their carriers are all unhurt.
Commander, we need to deliver the finishing blow.
Returning all our ships unhurt is part of our duty.
But...
We exit strategic waters now.
All ships turn around and return to port.
They turned around?
What are the mobile units doing?
Commander, let's attack them again.
- That would be an ill-advised attack.
- All attacks are ill-advised!
The goal of this plan is to destroy the enemy fleet, even risking our safety.
However...
Let us abide by Nagumo's judgement.
Commander!
There must be something we can't see from here in Japanese waters.
Listen...
Even robbers are scared to walk home.
He never made it back.
I see!
Every ship in the mobile unit fleet was unhurt.
Yes, there was no damage to any ship.
A battle must be fought to know its outcome.
Cheers!
Fleet Commander Yamamoto, Banzai!
Roosevelt's speech is on.
The Foreign Ministry definitely instructed the Japanese ambassador in Washington to deliver the declaration 30 minutes before the Pearl Harbor attack.
The Embassy staff must have mismanaged...
Mismanaged!
Mismanaged what?
I don't know the details, but ultimately the declaration wasn't delivered until one hour after our attack.
Perhaps the Embassy took more time to translate the Ministry's cable...
Took more time!
Do you mock me?
Does anyone in the Ministry or Military Command understand what this means?
Why did Commander Yamamoto stress...
Officer Miyake.
Sir.
Let's start.
What?
This will be a tough fight.
There.
Commander Yamamoto, we wish you a happy New Year!
Please make another lightning charge this year.
Wonderful, the economy will finally improve.
I can't remember such a refreshing New Year's!
Imperial fleet, Banzai!
Banzai!
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
Incredible.
He used to badmouth the Navy so much.
That ended with last year.
Oh, happy New Year!
Dear Iso, happy New Year
I know you must be working so very hard.
Nagaoka is all wrapped up in a white blanket of snow.
These days, my neighbours stop by nearly every day to talk about you.
They say you're a hero who saved our nation, and they pray every time they hear your name on the radio.
I know you hate that sort of thing more than anyone, but everyone is just so very proud of you that, as your sister,
I just listen to them gratefully.
When springtime comes,
I'll send you more sweets.
Please look forward to them.
Imperial Military Command announces that on February 15th, the British military surrenders on the island of Singapore...
We smashed their Oriental fleet and now Singapore has fallen.
Two months into this war, we are invincible.
The oil in Borneo is ours!
Editor!
Another run of the special edition!
Not since we went to war with China!
Our circulation will increase, too!
Where was that...
You ate 50 tangerines...
Not that many, only 47.
That was in Yugawara.
Pearl Harbor was a failure.
Yeah, a huge failure.
Not a single carrier in sight...
The Yankee spirit is in flames at the sneak attack.
Now they've got a righteous cause against Japan.
But our people are in seventh heaven.
You tried to evade war for them, but they want to go to war.
No doubt they think that wars happen far across the sea.
If the day comes when bombs rain down from the sky, this country will suffer.
You're going after them, one more time?
Yeah, we'll go after Hawaii again.
It won't take America six months to get back on its feet.
Before then, I'll smash their carriers and capture Hawaii.
That's the only way to sue for peace.
But if you bring up suing for peace in these invincible times, the people will faint from shock.
To this country, you're as almighty as God.
If I were God, I wouldn't start a war in the first place.
Admiral Yamamoto, I thank you on behalf of the Japanese people!
Have a seat.
Your victory instantly swept aside the dark clouds oppressing this nation.
You have managed to take revenge for the hardships and humiliations we've tasted since the Black Ships.
America will withdraw from China and Asia will fall into our hands.
Please tell us today about your vision towards final victory.
Sue for peace.
Sue for peace?
The soldier's most important duty is to finish the war he starts.
I'm truly shocked.
You have no idea what the people want now.
What public opinion expects now!
Regardless of public opinion, this country must not be destroyed.
I've wasted my time.
I can't print this as an article.
Excuse me.
You see...
Yes?
No, thank you for your earlier hospitality.
Take a good look at the world around you.
Got that, Shindo?
Yes.
The Yamato is big.
I can't seem to settle down.
Makes me want to hit the town.
Thank you!
SWEETS
That's all you're eating?
Better say what's on your mind.
The Military Command plans to expand the war.
They seem drunk on the initial victories.
Go ahead, eat.
Little girl.
Yes.
Can I have another bowl of sweet soup?
Yes.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
She's just...
No, no, the fault is mine.
I surprised you.
I was reckless when I was young and got hurt.
Now, more sweet soup, please.
Yes.
Thank you so much.
The plan is prepared.
MIDWAY STRATEGY PLAN
This will definitely draw out the carriers.
We'll smash them and capture Hawaii.
Military Command thinks Americans will be based in Australia and come north over the islands to invade Japan.
So they plan to capture Fiji and Samoa to stop their northern advances.
Can our fleet deploy so far?
Apparently the Fleet Commander is still targeting Hawaii.
I see, so the Navy has more than one mind.
Hayakawa, you stay on the Navy Ministry.
The rest of you keep your ears peeled for information from all sources.
This is totally different from Pearl Harbor.
What?
Before that attack, no one leaked any information.
Did we have an air raid drill scheduled today?
Tokyo bombed?
They flew mid-sized bombers from their carriers.
They've staged an airbase near Tokyo...
Fly the No. 1 Carrier Fleet combat squadron to Atsugi to defend Tokyo!
Yes, Sir!
It was a pitiful sight.
So, this is an air raid.
In order to prevent future air raids, the Army, responsible for homeland defence, is demanding that we push the Pacific frontline farther east.
Therefore, I have approved the Midway Plan.
Yes, Sir.
I hear Yamamoto is saying the goal is to lure their aircraft carriers, but the real goal is to capture the Midway Islands.
The priority is to capture it to create a frontline base.
Got that, Nagumo?
Yes, Sir.
We'll destroy the enemy's airbase and land assault troops.
After, we quickly occupy the island.
At the same time, our carriers will standby between Hawaii and Midway.
We'll wait for the enemy aircraft carriers that will surely be lured, and use all our strength to annihilate them.
According to Military Command, capturing the island is their priority.
No, capturing Midway and luring their aircraft carriers are both goals.
The enemy carriers were hard hit in the battle at Coral Sea, two weeks ago.
They won't take the bait.
Even if they do, they're nothing to fear.
What's your evidence?
What?
What evidence do you have that they're nothing to fear?
Well, that's...
Even in Hawaii, which Military Command considers a resounding victory, we lost 55 of our best trained flight crew.
From now on, America won't let us surprise them with any more attacks.
For an officer to assert that the enemy is nothing to fear, is the height of insecurity.
Sir, I apologise.
For the Pacific fleet in Hawaii, Midway is a treasured forward airbase.
If we hammer it, their carriers have to come.
Nagumo.
Yes.
To prepare for their aircraft carriers, load half of the Akagi's fighters with torpedoes and have them standing by.
Understood.
The goal of this plan is to lure the enemy carriers and annihilate them.
No matter what the cost, we cannot ever let enemy planes fly in Japanese skies.
May 27th, 1942.
The battleship Yamato, helmed by Yamamoto, followed Nagumo's Akagi to Midway, joining a giant attack fleet of over 200 ships.
You haven't gotten a raise in pay this past year, have you, Miyake?
Sir...
You went on the attack.
You'll get a bonus next month.
Sir...
If we had stayed in the Inland Sea,
I couldn't give you bonuses or medals.
The military is a complicated business...
Don't you need to load torpedoes onto half of our fighters?
The enemy carriers will never come.
So we don't need to arm torpedoes.
Bombs for capturing Midway are all we need.
Forward at half speed.
Forward at half speed.
I can smell 'em.
There are carriers.
I report.
Our submarines off of Kwajalein Atoll report intercepting enemy carrier signals.
Read it!
The enemy carrier position is 170 sea miles north-north-west of Midway.
I knew they'd come.
Officer, don't you need to let the Akagi know, too?
No, the Akagi should have also received it.
And we're in radio silence.
If we send a cable, the enemy may be able to identify our position.
Right...
Midway Islands, 30 degrees to right.
All planes attack!
Sir, there are no planes on their runway!
They were ready...
Officer, are you sure there are no enemy carriers?
Yes, our six reconnaissance planes have found nothing and the carriers won't come here.
You don't need to worry.
According to reports, the weather near Midway will dramatically improve.
When the clouds clear,
Nagumo will be totally exposed.
Officer Miyake.
Time for a game.
I report!
The first attack squad reports "Bombing results inadequate.
Second attack on Midway required."
That's all.
An Army detachment of 2,000 men are approaching the island.
If they don't all land safely, the Navy's reputation is at stake.
We must launch a second attack immediately.
Emergency report from plane four!
Discovered enemy carrier!
What?
Bearing 10 degrees from Midway, 240 sea miles, 150 degrees course, 20 knots!
That's all.
Distance from mother ship?
Roger.
Let's send the second attack against the enemy carrier.
No, they're only carrying bombs for Midway.
We can blast open their decks.
Why are our fighter planes in the air?
They have to land on our deck to refuel.
We can't afford to.
They can't attack without support!
They're late.
Communications.
Signal the Akagi!
"Approve immediate second attack."
Yes.
Enemy planes estimated arrival, 05:15, in 30 minutes.
Don't panic.
We can deploy all planes in 15 minutes.
Commander...
Bring in the escort planes.
Refit the second attack squadron with torpedoes.
Hurry!
Sir!
Okay, this way!
I'm going down first.
Roger!
Any response from the Akagi?
Nothing.
Less than 20 minutes to enemy planes.
Second attack squadron ready for take-off.
All planes take off!
All planes take off!
Enemy planes in five minutes!
Enemy planes!
Overhead!
Dive-bombing!
Full starboard!
This carrier will attack their carriers.
Signal battle command.
I hereby take over command of the air battle.
Sir.
Listen well.
We will sink one enemy carrier if it costs our lives.
At this rate, the Imperial Navy will be an eternal laughing stock.
Yes, Sir!
4.2 east-south-east...
I will confirm.
Excuse me!
Cable from the Hiryu!
Akagi, Kaga and Soryu, bombed and on fire.
Hiryu is attacking the carriers alone.
They got three of our ships.
Where are the escort squadrons?
Arima!
Enemy planes!
Overhead!
Dive-bombing!
Full starboard!
You all fought hard to the end!
I'm grateful to you!
There's a long war still ahead.
Survive...
Survive!
And put this experience to work, to create a strong Navy!
Go!
Commander!
Get off now!
Commander!
Commander!
Please abandon ship!
Just go now.
They sank four of our carriers.
Someone has to stay behind.
I will stay, too!
I will, too!
I'm plenty.
Hurry, go!
Commander!
A keepsake.
Enough...
Go.
Excuse me.
I report.
After sinking the carrier Yorktown, the Hiryu was set ablaze and sank.
So that's it.
They got the Hiryu.
Also, Commander Yamaguchi went down with the ship.
It's over now...
Let's attack them at night!
We'll never catch up.
And at first light, we'll become a target subjecting the flagship to the enemy's bombs!
I know that, Sir!
This is the second time, following Hawaii.
We can't limp back to port like this.
We can't take the commander back to Japan under these pathetic conditions!
Kuroshima...
Sir!
Enough.
Let's go home to Japan.
Excuse me!
Commander Nagumo is aboard.
Right.
Miyake.
Sir.
Don't blame Nagumo.
I apologise for this outcome.
Eat your rice soup while it's hot.
"American carriers sunk!"
"120 planes attack!"
The Imperial Navy does it again!
Why aren't there any pictures?
There were huge pictures when Singapore fell.
Yeah.
All sinking enemy ships look the same.
Really?
"Our fleet losses were minor."
But a single ship carries hundreds of sailors.
They went down with the ship.
That's just how warfare is...
Good evening.
You were closed today.
You're the man...
I'm so sorry.
Without sugar or beans since the rations, we had to close...
I see...
I'll come back again.
Oh, right.
I'm sorry for scaring you the other day.
My apologies.
It will suit you.
In the waters off Guadalcanal of the Solomon Islands, our Imperial Navy, launched a huge attack, sinking two enemy aircraft carriers...
Despite its great victory at Midway, the Imperial Navy abandoned its plans to capture Hawaii.
Instead, according to their original plans, built an airbase on Guadalcanal, to destroy the invading Americans, heading north, on their way to fortify Australia.
Many Army officers were deployed.
The Imperial Fleet's Command and the flagship Yamato headed south anchoring near Truk Island on the equator.
There's oil on Borneo, but with our tankers getting sunk like this...
No doubt things on Guadalcanal are nightmarish.
They were occupied three months ago.
Never expected the Americans would counterattack so quickly...
Yamamoto saw it coming.
It was the military bureaucrats in command who have no idea...
They always reason so as to match their foregone conclusions.
They don't have a shred of evidence.
I'm sure Yamamoto has it rough out there.
It should have been Singapore.
We missed our chance to sue for peace.
We may have been mistaken...
But still,
Yamamoto hasn't given up.
No matter what, I'm sure he's trying to somehow sue for peace...
You're right.
Yamamoto never gives up...
Over four days, they hammered our 11 battleships, including Kongo, Haruna, Jujun, Aoba and Chokai, with 3,000 shells and completely destroyed our airfield on Guadalcanal.
But the enemy is deploying incredible numbers of reinforcements.
It won't take them long to rebuild the airfield.
What's the condition of the Army?
Following the annihilation of the detachment that landed in August, the 5,000 troops under Kawaguchi's command are already destroyed...
This was the Navy's plan...
We must do something, but...
What?
Excuse me.
It's been a while.
You'll be at the Naval Academy...
I hear you strongly recommended me as director of the Naval Academy.
Really?
I don't think it's right to go home to Japan at a time like this.
Inoue...
Yes.
The academy needs you now more than ever.
What?
If the worst should happen, the young must rebuild our nation.
Train the young.
You can do it.
Just like you once saved the Navy...
It's in your hands.
Yes, Sir.
Our landed troops have run out of food and ammunition.
At this rate, our troops remaining on the island will be annihilated.
The Imperial Fleet still has the Mutsu and the Nagato.
It also has this ship the Yamato, the mightiest in the world.
If we don't fire our big guns now, when do we?
But listen, Kadokura...
We should gather the full fleet for a final massive attack!
Commander Kadokura, excuse me, but we wish for that, too.
Why don't you?
- But...
- But, what?
In truth...
We don't have the fuel.
We will retreat from Guadalcanal.
But the Navy has a responsibility to the Army.
We mobilise every destroyer to rescue as many troops off Guadalcanal as we can.
I'll notify Central Command.
I'll make sure this plan of retreat succeeds...
Commander...
In that case, allow me to escort the destroyers.
Understood.
It's in your hands.
In the three days of strategic retreat, we rescued over 10,000 Army and Navy men.
I see.
But during his command,
Commander Kadokura was killed in battle.
Make sure his family receives his personal effects.
Yes, Sir.
From Imperial Headquarters.
In order to accomplish their mission, the troops fighting on Guadalcanal have been transferred off the island.
Transferred?
Editor, what exactly does "transferred" mean?
It means to proceed elsewhere.
In actuality, doesn't that mean retreat?
Elite Army and Navy troops secured a strategic base on the Solomons.
Therefore, they head to New Guinea, their original goal...
What else is that but a transfer?
Chief.
The public is realising that Midway was a disastrous defeat.
Isn't our mission to convey the truth to the public?
The mission of our newspapers is to stay ahead of the people and guide their will, even as Japan constructs a new world order.
We report our military's glorious exploits and keep spirits high at home!
Isn't that what's needed?
Is that really our mission?
Shindo.
Right now, every citizen, is fighting together...
Is fighting together!
I'll finish the editorial in two hours.
Okay!
We'll lead with,
"Our elite troops transfer from Guadalcanal."
Yes.
Tell the copydesk.
Yes, I will.
CONGRATULATIONS TO OUR DRAFTEES
April, 1943.
The Imperial Fleet moved its Command to Rabaul, to concentrate its aviator strength.
The newspaper is increasingly filled with "transfers".
One and a half years into this war,
I fear we are headed for a war of attrition, like the war we're fighting against China.
But no one dares say it out loud.
IMPERIAL FLEET COMMAND RABAUL
SAEKI
ARIMA
YAMAGUCHI
KADOKURA
One year and four months into this war, you've all fought hard in tough conditions.
But enemy attacks grow stronger every day.
The Imperial Fleet will now conduct its final battle.
First, we'll consolidate the Rabaul-based air squadrons with all the aircraft carriers in the Third Fleet.
Then we'll annihilate the enemy aviators deployed in the Solomon-New Guinea area.
After that...
We'll immediately reduce our front line.
Are we transferring?
No, it's a retreat.
Words must be used accurately.
We pull back to the Marianas.
We use Guam and Saipan as an unsinkable carrier and fight our final air battle.
With that victory,
we sue for peace...
However, if we retreat our front line, the enemy will launch an all-out attack there.
I didn't say we pull back everything.
We'll keep the front line bases until the rear is prepared.
What about the troops...
Yes, they'll be sacrificed.
It's the final battle, to sue for peace.
Okay, return to base!
Roger!
Mother...
Today, the Igo Plan has ended.
It was a rare victory.
We can now head to the Marianas.
Yes.
Commander.
Lt. Makino died in combat.
I see...
Makino's gone, too...
Chief of Staff,
I'll inspect the front lines on the 18th, too.
No, there are daily enemy attacks on those bases.
You cannot accompany us there.
Mine may be an ugly face, but the troops are happy to see it.
I'm grateful.
Your humble servant has so many of his dear men divided in this world and the next.
I both want them to welcome me there and remain here to serve on earth a little longer...
I am of two minds, but have one body.
Come in.
Excuse me.
What's that scary look for?
Commander Ozawa is insisting that you must not inspect the front lines.
But if you insist, he'll fly as many escort planes as you wish.
Just the usual, please.
Don't blow it out of proportion.
But, Sir...
The usual is fine.
Listen, Miyake.
Sir.
A lot of young men have died.
Japan's youth, who shoulder the future, are all dying first.
I'm an old man, still sticking around...
When I see them again, how am I supposed to greet them?
What's a man to do...
Come in.
Excuse me.
What is it?
I've been drafted into the infantry.
I see.
Akiyama will take over the Imperial War Record.
I understand.
Thank you for everything.
Fight the good fight for your country, Japan.
Yes.
Shindo...
I'll be off.
Hey!
You'll get malaria from the mosquitoes!
Excuse me.
Don't act so shocked.
Even I have a glass of whisky now and then.
It's the midsummer festival I burned the tip of my nose...
Hey, hey, what's that?
I memorised it.
Don't screw it up.
All right, I'll teach you the correct lyrics.
It's the midsummer festival
Time for eggplant rice pot
I burned the tip of my nose
Licking up every scrap
I burned the tip of my nose
Licking up every scrap
How dare you signal the commander's movements!
What if the enemy intercepts it?
We land at the base on Ballale in 15 minutes.
Right.
Enemy planes!
Emergency landing!
Commander!
After pondering the general trends of the world and the actual conditions in our empire today, we have decided to effect a settlement of the present situation by resorting to an extraordinary measure.
We have ordered our government to communicate to the U. S., Great Britain, China, and the Soviet Union, that our empire accepts the provisions of theirjoint declaration...
Admiral Yamamoto, it's been two years and four months since you died.
And so, the war ended in a manner far removed from the peace you so desired.
Since the war began in Pearl Harbor, some three million have lost their lives to it.
Over 90% of those lives were lost after you died.
After you died on Bougainville, there was no one left in Japan, who could bring the war to an end.
When and how did we go wrong?
And what did we lose?
We will abandon our past, and create a new Japan with America.
This is our greatest mission for the future!
Okay, that's the editorial!
The answer to that may have to wait 50 or 100 years...
Put this word "Democratize" in the biggest font!
Yes.
But that may also be enough time for the people of our country to forget everything.
IMPERIAL WAR RECORD
But Admiral Yamamoto, that you, who opposed the war above all others, were forced to light its fire...
And that you fought all your battles to restore peace as soon as possible...
These facts, I will always remember.
WAR RECORD OF IMPERIAL JAPAN BY SHINDO
Admiral Yamamoto,
I believe we must start over by really looking at the world.
Following your words, by opening our eyes, our ears and our hearts.
Hey, Iso.
At the time of the Boshin Civil War, your grandfather was already 77 years old.
But he bravely charged the enemy.
He died a glorious death.
Our city, Nagaoka, burned for three days and nights.
The whole city burned to ashes.
It was a horrible sight to behold.
That was 20 years ago.
Time does fly...
THE ADMIRAL (ADMIRAL YAMAMOTO)
DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY
Company, halt!
Left turn!
Take aim!
What the hell are you up to!
How dare you aim at the Navy!
How dare you!
Withdraw!
If the Army wants a fight, let us be prepared!
Hurry to the generators!
If they cut off our water and power, 3,000 men won't be able to flush!
Withdraw!
At ease!
Company, advance!
Yes.
Excuse me.
I've ordered a Yokosuka land battalion to stand by.
I see.
The Army is insolent!
To conclude the Tripartite Pact, they're even threatening a coup d'état.
That was a real scare.
I thought they'd really shoot.
The Army and Navy shooting at each other is no joking matter.
But I trust all is well, Yamamoto?
Yes.
With General Inoue in charge, things will be fine.
Right.
I'll excuse myself, then.
Minister.
Please make no scandalous detours on your way home today.
Right.
Only because you insist.
He'll detour.
Yes, a detour is written all over his face.
Excuse me.
Undersecretary, Chief Editor Munakata of Tokyo Nippo is here.
Oh, it's that time already?
I leave you in charge.
Shindo here was completely panicked that a battle was about to start.
At this rate, we could repeat the tragedy of the February 26 coup from three years ago.
Undersecretary, you should look after your own personal safety.
I appreciate your concern.
Even with things in this state, will the Navy still oppose the Tripartite Pact?
Yes, of course.
Is your reason America?
If we side with Germany, America won't sit still.
Which country stole land from our countrymen with their discriminatory law?
America.
And proposed the League of Nations but refuses to join over the Monroe Doctrine?
America.
On top of that, expands their own colonies, but refuses to acknowledge our rightful national interests in Asia?
As you say.
Why wouldn't you try to sweep aside such a country?
Can you sweep them aside?
It's true.
Their shipbuilding capacity is 4.5 times ours.
For aeroplanes, six times, for cars, 100 times.
For oil, 700 times ours.
In half a day, they produce Japan's annual consumption.
In national strength, America is 10 times stronger than Japan.
Your understanding is correct.
But in the Russo-Japanese war, we beat Russia, also 10 times our might, right?
At the time, Russia was undergoing a revolution.
Thus, we could sue for peace after one victorious battle.
But today, wars are total wars.
It will not end until one side has burned to ashes.
So we should shut up and do America's bidding?
No.
We must boldly assert our nation's conditions and confront our opponents without fear.
But that, should be handled by diplomacy.
That is my point.
Your point is well taken.
But the last resort of diplomacy is war...
Is it not?
Listen, Mr. Munakata, once you start a war, there's no turning back.
We must not bring catastrophe upon our nation by charging without sober deliberation.
So we must grin and bear it?
Even if our people are smothered by this gloomy helplessness?
Isn't it you, who are fanning the flames of this helplessness you refer to?
The newspapers simply represent public opinion.
This public opinion, is it truly the voice of the people?
Right.
Welcome back!
- Shindo, Shindo!
- Yes!
Did you get Undersecretary Yamamoto?
The chief is in his room.
Okay!
He'll write the editorial in time.
Akiyama!
What was Undersecretary Yamamoto like?
He's a mysterious man.
But it's clear the Tripartite Pact is a long way off.
Internally, the Navy is still fighting the Boshin War.
The Boshin War?
The Navy's inner circle come from Satsuma and Choshu clans.
But the minister and the general come from Morioka and Sendai.
And the Undersecretary comes from Nagaoka.
They all fought Satsuma and Choshu.
I see, of course they'll clash.
WAR RECORDS OF IMPERIAL JAPAN
War Records of Imperial Japan.
In 1868, even as the Boshin Civil War raged, our nation entered the new Meiji era, and based on twin victories over Russia and China, grew to be counted among the world's five great nations.
And the Great War, which erupted in the Taisho era, brought our nation unprecedented prosperity.
But as the Showa era dawned, the great depression stormed Japan.
Advancing on Manchuria was Japan's solution.
Ever since, our conflict with China intensified and over the course of seven years of localized combat, domestically, Japan witnessed three major military coups d'états, spreading social anxiety.
On July 7th, 1937, war with China erupts.
Japan and China are finally in full-scale war.
The Army believed it would win in one month, but the Soviet Union, England, and America all aided Chiang Kai-shek's government and the fighting bogged down.
That was when Germany, under command of Hitler, asked Japan to join the Tripartite Pact with Italy.
For Japan, bogged down in China, it was an extremely attractive offer.
The Japanese people were in a frenzy over Germany's ferocious military advance over Europe.
But despite an avalanche of support for the Tripartite Pact, the Navy's sole opposition managed to prevent its conclusion.
"...to join forces with our German ally,
"to liberate Asia from the grip of the Euro-American powers,
"in order to build the New East Asian Order,
"now is the time for the Navy to decisively support the Tripartite Pact.
"We fervently desire this."
All right, that's the editorial.
Submit this!
Yes!
Yes?
Political Desk.
Aborted assassination?
ASSASSINATION PLOT
UNDERSECRETARY YAMAMOTO TARGET
I demand that the Navy's Yonai, Yamamoto, and Inoue, who all advance
Britain and America's cause, by blocking the Tripartite Pact, so essential to Japanese policy today, all resign immediately!
The Military Police have offered protection.
The usual routine is fine.
The Army's Military Police scare me more.
But, Sir...
The usual routine is fine.
If my death awakens the Japanese people, so be it.
Totally inappropriate!
Don't twist things your way!
Isn't the Tripartite Pact necessary so that Germany can restrain the Soviet Union from invading south!
Incomprehensible!
Do you have any brains in your head?
Why the hell would Germany move to support Japan?
What!
Oh, Sir...
Are you all analyzing international affairs?
These naval officers are worse than the Army.
Undersecretary, why do you not acknowledge the strength of our ally, Germany?
Our ally?
You're awfully devoted to Germany.
In that case, I presume you've read Hitler's Mein Kampf?
Every last page.
In other words, the Japanese are an inferior race, lacking in imagination, but they are skilful and clever and perfect for Germany to use!
I never read those words!
Of course not!
Because Chapter 11 in your edition is conveniently deleted!
Unfortunately, it seems an essential part was missing from the Japanese translation you men read.
If you don't trace things back to their source, you can overlook the essentials.
Enter.
Excuse me.
What?
Germany signed a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union.
Your ally has sided with our sworn enemy.
Prime Minister Hiranuma is dissolving the cabinet.
The signing of the non-aggression pact between Germany and the Soviet...
Hitler gave up on Japan because we dithered.
Farewell Tripartite Pact.
War with America will have to wait thanks to the cowards in the Navy.
- Welcome.
- All done with the show?
I'm so hungry.
Noodles please!
At least remove your stage makeup before filling your belly.
Nobody brings me snacks to my dressing room any more.
Not in this economy...
If they don't start a war soon, my factory will go bankrupt.
Say, if a war starts, will the economy really get better?
In the Great War, 20 years ago, the economy quickly recovered.
That's right, war is best.
We're already at war with China.
We can't start wars everywhere.
But it's America that's behind China.
So if we beat America, we can beat China, too.
Exactly!
YAMAMOTO PROMOTED TO FLEET COMMANDER
Six pence!
This one, too.
Minister, the Tripartite Pact negotiations ended, but none of the problems are solved.
Please let me remain and serve as Undersecretary.
But if you stay here in headquarters, you'll run out of lives.
Why don't you spend some time out at sea.
Hey, Inoue.
Thank you for your long service.
I'm grateful.
You forcefully pressured the Ministry into stopping the Tripartite Pact.
You saved the Navy.
No, I had my hands full reining in the youth.
Which left no time for constructive discussions about the future of Japan.
I'm disappointed.
Well...
In the fall, I'll be transferred to the China Sea fleet.
I had hoped that at least you would stay in the Ministry.
Admiral Yamamoto...
Thank you for everything.
Right, we'll meet again.
So you're the Fleet Commander.
You, who never aspired to fame or fortune.
You're unmatched in the Navy, Hori, and much more suited than me.
Won't you take my place?
I'm a civilian now.
They fired me five years ago.
"Fleet in being."
A nation's navy is always defending.
It exists to guarantee peace.
The non-combative fleet you kept lobbying for, is hard to realize.
The current Military Command knows nothing of war and neither do the military planners.
It's impossible to persuade them.
Hori...
Yeah?
Take my place?
It's been five years since I've been to sea.
September, 1939,
Yamamoto bid farewell to the Navy Ministry.
And he assumed his post as Fleet Commander on the flagship, Nagato, based on Hashira Island in the Inland Sea.
Just then, the blitzkrieg struck Europe.
Germany finally launched its attack against Poland.
In response, England and France declared war.
The peace in Europe did not even last 20 years, and eight months passed in this new Second World War.
Meanwhile, under Yamamoto's command, the Japanese fleet improved the performance of its aircraft carriers, vigorously training its carrier-based planes.
May, 1940,
Germany broke its inaction and began invading again.
Quickly conquering Belgium and Holland, in one month, it occupied Paris.
It was an overwhelming victory, a "blitzkrieg" in every sense.
As though in concert with Germany's blitzkrieg, voices called anew for the Tripartite Pact in Japan.
The Germans can't seem to be stopped.
Once our Yamato battleship is built, we'll be invincible.
Chief of Staff, the future belongs to aeroplanes.
We could build 1,000 planes for the price of one of your battleships.
Listen, the history of our Japanese Navy is built on battles at sea...
These Inland Sea sardines are tasty.
Yes.
Both of you hail from the Inland Sea area, don't you?
Yes.
I'm envious.
Your fish are tasty to the bone.
Where did you get these, the sweet dumplings!
Sweet dumplings?
Enter, Makino.
Excuse me.
I'm Ensign Makino, who served under you at Kasumigaura Air Corps.
I assumed my position on the Akagi's combat unit yesterday.
Good to hear.
Is this your doing?
Yes!
I was given leave and went home to Nagaoka.
They're my mother's homemade dumplings.
Try some.
Sugar on sweet dumplings?
That's right.
Is your mother well?
She is delighted that I will be working under your command.
Tasty.
Enjoy.
Thanks.
Saeki, your rear!
Oh, no, rats!
Great!
Victory!
Arima, stay focused on your rear!
Yes!
Always a battlefield?
Yes, it means endeavor in everything as though you are at war.
But the Nagaoka samurai have three principles.
Three?
The second is Kawai's spirit of duty.
Kawai fought to the bitter end, never forgetting his debt to the Shogunate.
- Tokugawa?
- Debt?
Yes.
Thirdly, the spirit of 100 bushels of rice.
One hundred bushels of rice?
Even after the battle was lost and our clansmen were starving, our clan clung to the gift of 100 bushels of rice, building a school with its profit.
When everyone was starving?
A hundred bushels of rice are gone if you eat them.
But if you spend it on people, it can grow to be 10,000 bushels.
If you are to lead men, always consider the future.
ALWAYS A BATTLEFIELD
100,000 men.
What?
We lost 100,000 men in the Russo-Japanese war.
But after 20 or 30 years, everyone quickly forgets.
The newspapers and the people.
Being good at forgetting is one of our people's strengths, as well.
- Please.
- I know.
In order to participate in Germany's new world economy, now is the time to conclude the Tripartite Pact.
We must not miss this bus...
The Tripartite Pact, is now an agreement between four nations, including the Soviet Union, and confronted with these four nations, even America will reconsider its disrespect.
We are done with the weak-willed Navy!
Now is the time to conclude the Tripartite Pact!
Don't miss the bus!
Listen, Navy Minister!
MINISTRY OF THE NAVY
I have only just taken Yoshida's place as Navy Minister, but political stagnation must not be permitted.
If the Navy persists in opposing the Tripartite Pact,
Konoe's cabinet will be forced to resign and we cannot be held to blame.
Therefore, I reluctantly propose that we revise our policy.
I hope that you officers will join my support for the Tripartite Pact.
Any objections?
Please wait.
I swear total allegiance to your command, Minister.
But I do have some concerns, so let me ask you, if the Tripartite Pact is concluded, the chances of a conflict with America increase.
Currently, our lack of aviators is apparent.
If we do go to war with America, we will need 1,000 fighter planes and 1,000 bombers.
In other words, we must double our current plane strength.
But our country relies on America for steel, oil and other manufacturing resources.
If we sign with Germany now, we will inevitably lose all of that.
In which case, how have you revised your plans, to compensate for that loss?
Please tell me.
We will await the future deliberations of each department...
Minister, that is not an answer.
Please tell me the reason why you think a war against America is possible.
I'm sure you have your opinions, but the majority is in favor, so...
Excuse me.
A telegram from the commander.
"Begin planning the attack."
I'm home!
Oh, my.
Welcome home.
Yes.
Thanks for the food.
Yoshimasa, pickles are for the end of the meal.
Yes.
Take a sip of miso soup before you eat rice.
What's most important is to clean your plate and eat your fill.
Yes.
Here, Yoshimasa.
Here.
Thank you.
Here, Sumi.
There you go.
Thank you.
Here, Ma.
Thank you.
Here, Tadao.
Thank you.
Here, Mother.
Thank you.
Commander Yamamoto, it seems we'll finally join the Tripartite Pact.
"The national defense
"is to provide requisite armed forces, but also to grow national strength,
"while using diplomacy to evade war.
"That is the essence of national defense.
"In other words,
"the national defense is not exclusive to soldiers..."
Those are the words of Admiral Kato, who, taking Japan's future into consideration, decided to sign the Washington Disarmament Treaty, limiting naval armaments.
The words of that notorious Prime Minister Kato who created the flip-flop cabinet.
September 27th, 1940.
The Tripartite Pact which shook our nation for three years, was finally concluded.
The bus Japan climbed on has taken off, engines gunning.
Who's in my plane?
Commander.
I wish this could fly to Monaco.
Excuse me, Sir!
There's a gambling den called a casino.
If I hadn't become a sailor, I'd have made my fortune there.
I see.
Commander, may I ask you a question?
I boarded your plane, I guess I have to answer you.
What?
As a man from Nagaoka, I can understand Kawai's spirit of study.
Indeed...
Always remember the debt to the Shogunate and fight to the bitter end.
But the Shogunate ended years ago.
What are we to feel indebted to today?
To our parents who gave birth to us.
And our birthplace which nurtured their lives.
In other words, our country.
It means we must labor for Japan.
Yes, Sir.
Excuse me.
Yes.
I've brought Admiral Nagumo.
I'm assuming my new duties.
Through strenuous efforts, I will execute my duties.
Right.
It's been a while.
Care to stay for supper?
No, I must return to my new duties on the Akagi.
I see.
In other words, Nagumo commands the No. 1 Aircraft Carrier Fleet, while commanding the combat planes on the Akagi and the Kaga.
While Yamaguchi commands the No. 2 Aircraft Carrier Fleet.
The Navy made a radical personnel assignment.
Is there a problem?
Nagumo is a pure "fleet faction" man who pushed hard to expand the fleet.
He's the one who shoved Hori, a "treaty faction" man, into early retirement.
Oh, Vice Admiral Hori, renowned as a rare talent that could lead the Navy.
And Hori was Yamamoto's classmate and his closest friend.
There is no way that Yamamoto and Nagumo will get along.
Commander Yamamoto has it rough with Nagumo in charge of his combat planes.
Indeed.
Hello, political desk.
Germany voided its non-aggression pact with the Soviets!
What!
Turn the radio on.
... is advancing to the Eastern Front.
I repeat.
Early yesterday, Germany announced it is voiding its non-aggression pact.
Nazi military forces are marching to the Eastern Front, heading for Moscow.
With the sudden Germany/Soviet conflict, Munakata couldn't leave the office, so I took the liberty of coming in his stead.
The bus seems to be racing in an unexpected direction.
The route is somewhat off course, but as Munakata writes in his editorials, if Germany manages to crush the Soviets, our greatest northern threat disappears.
This bus has no choice but to keep running.
How far will it run?
What?
I'm asking, what is its destination?
The Great East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere.
The Great East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere.
If there really is such a place, I'd sure like to visit it once.
The job of a newspaper is to witness and listen to new global developments and convey them widely.
Open wide your eyes, your ears and your heart when you look around the world.
That's the duty of those who shoulder the next generation, Shindo.
War Records of Imperial Japan.
Attack on Franco-Indonesia.
In July, 1941, in order to secure natural resources, the Imperial Navy finally invaded the French colony of Indonesia.
To retaliate, America stopped all exports of steel, oil and other essential resources to Japan...
Relations between Japan and America have now become extremely volatile.
In the unlikely event we go to war against America and England, how will we be able to end hostilities?
Prime Minister, it's true that America is a powerful nation.
Even if we do win a decisive victory at sea, they will not easily surrender and we must anticipate a long war.
But if Germany wins decisively over Europe and the Soviets,
American public opinion will change dramatically, and there is the possibility that it will end the war.
Possibility?
A battle must be fought to know its outcome.
Finally made it in under 15 minutes.
On our ship, Hiryu, we'll clock even shorter times.
It's you, Yamaguchi.
I heard you were inspecting the combat squadrons and arrived to assist you.
Liar, you just want to eat the Navy's best chow, here on the Nagato.
There's that, too.
Can it not be stopped?
It seems not.
Since when did the Navy start to favor battle?
I wonder...
A soldier must follow orders, but...
By the time you command this fleet, the Navy will change.
No, I believe you are the commander who will change the Navy.
Too slow!
Sixty seconds between descending planes.
Saeki, don't look at your altimeter!
Eyeball it!
Sir!
Makino!
Commander!
Your squadron leader is from Nagaoka.
I bet he's tough!
Sir!
Where are you from?
Sir, I'm from Kagoshima!
Yamaguchi!
From Satsuma and Choshu!
The future of Japan rests on your shoulders!
Work hard!
Yes, Sir!
Nagaoka, Satsuma and Choshu!
Work together to defend Japan!
Yes, Sir!
Special edition!
Tojo's Prime Minister!
Give me one.
Two pence.
We keep getting new prime ministers.
We've had nine in five years.
That's good.
We finally have an Army general as prime minister.
Finally, Japan's going to war.
But can we really beat America?
First, it was the Mongols, then the Chinese, the Russians and the Great War.
When Japan fights a foreign war, we always win!
The country may win, but people still die.
My nephew died in China last year.
They haven't even sent his bones home.
"Navy representative to the London Naval Treaty negotiations..."
Here.
Thanks.
Still researching Yamamoto?
Yes.
We fought China when he was 10, Russia when he was 20.
He graduated naval academy in time for the Battle of Tsushima.
He lost two fingers from his left hand from Russian cannon fire.
So Yamamoto was the first sailor the Navy commended for being wounded.
The Great War at 30, the Manchurian Incident at 47, war starts with China at 53, and when he becomes Fleet Commander at 55 war breaks out in Europe on the very next day.
The path of Yamamoto's life is in itself Imperial Japan's War Record.
"Navy Orders No. 1.
"Orders to Fleet Commander Yamamoto.
"First, in order to defend itself, our empire
"will make all strategic preparations necessary
"to attack America, England and Holland in early December.
"Second, the Fleet Commander
"will implement all strategic preparations..."
It's the midsummer festival
Time for eggplant rice pot
I burned the tip of my nose licking up every scrap...
I find it pathetic that this is my ordered fate.
It's too late to lay blame at anyone's feet.
My current position, in which I must resolve to violate all my personal convictions as I work without distractions is very odd indeed...
This is part of my fate.
Fate is cruel.
Excuse me.
The outline of the strategy is ready.
PEARL HARBOR ATTACK PLANS
Right.
The giant force will consist of six aircraft carriers and 350 carrier-based aeroplanes.
It will converge in the bay of Eto Island and head east across the Pacific.
Then it will head due south to 200 naval miles off Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.
The carrier-based planes will attack Pearl Harbor with torpedoes, horizontal bombing and dive-bombing.
It will destroy America's Pacific fleet, anchoring at port.
But aren't the seas of the Northern Pacific dangerously rough in winter?
- That is what the enemy assumes.
- What about re-supplies?
We are currently improving plans for re-supplying at sea.
There are problems with the attack.
Pearl Harbor bay is only 12 meters deep.
If we drop torpedoes, they'll hit the ocean floor.
We're adapting our torpedoes to compensate.
This is too big a gamble!
We stick with the command's strategy, attacking the southern oilfields first!
What if enemy planes start bombing the Japanese homeland, while we're focused on the southern oilfields?
That's...
This strategy is not a gamble.
If we have to go to war with America, we have to destroy their carriers first.
If we free up their mobile units, they'll stage an airbase near Tokyo.
Japan's skies will become vulnerable.
America is currently building 200 warships.
Compared to them, we can only build 30 in the next three years.
If we have no choice but to fight them, we attack first, prepared for annihilation.
We ferociously attack their main fleet, pummeling the American Navy and the American will to fight
with the vigor of our fighting spirit and then immediately sue for peace.
Early peace.
There is no other path to Japan's survival.
Even if we die upon each other's sword, we must destroy the enemy's jewels.
If this should fail, our country will perish.
The Hawaii plan represents my conviction.
MINISTRY OF THE NAVY
Yamamoto's talking about preparing for annihilation, but a war with America will be long.
Nagumo, return with my fleet intact.
Don't let a single ship sink.
Yes, Sir.
Hello.
Thanks for your business.
Welcome home.
What's that, snapper?
Mother ordered it after you called.
Where is she?
She's sick in bed, with a bad cold.
Oh, I see.
One, two, one, two...
I'm so sorry.
Do you have a fever?
I'm over it now.
Let us eat.
Thanks for the food.
Stay in bed.
No...
When I graduated artillery school, the Meiji Emperor gave this to me.
The coded telegram fixing the date of this strategy is,
"Nii Takayama Nobore."
However, if the on-going negotiations in Washington reach agreement, even after the planes have taken off from their carrier, they must turn back.
That's impossible.
They can't turn back with the enemy in their sights.
The men won't stand for it.
What do you think is the reason we foster and train our soldiers?
It is solely to defend our nation's peace!
If an officer believes he cannot turn back after receiving this order,
I forbid your deployment.
Submit your resignation, now!
Also, in the unlikely event that we must go to war, you shall not bomb civilian residential areas.
Drill that into your guts.
Commander, about the plan to storm the bay with miniature submarines?
Can they safely accommodate the crews?
No, not yet...
In that case, I can't approve that plan.
I can tolerate desperate plans but not one with no chance of survival.
I understand.
Please confirm with Military Command.
In the event we go to war, make sure to send a final warning to America.
They must swear to send this.
Yes.
When Japanese samurai strike an enemy at night, at least they kick his pillow
to awaken him first.
If we attack before a final warning is delivered, the Japanese Navy's name will be ruined.
December 8th, 1941.
The giant attack force of 350 planes taking off from six aircraft carriers attacked the American Pacific fleet anchored at Pearl Harbor.
This raised the curtain on the Pacific War.
I can see the fleet.
All planes attack!
Enemy planes, Sir!
Ready.
Ready!
Ready!
Sir, there are no carriers!
No.
There aren't.
Telegram from Hawaii.
"Tora Tora Tora!
Surprise attack succeeds!"
Officer Fujii.
I know I repeat myself, but make sure to confirm they delivered the declaration of war.
Yes, Sir.
Squadron leader!
Oh, you're well.
Yes!
Where's Saeki?
He's not back yet.
He should be soon...
We sighted no carriers in the bay.
We couldn't attack their fuel tanks.
Please let us make a second attack.
I report!
From Commander Yamaguchi of the No. 2 Carrier Fleet.
"I confirm the need for a second attack!" That's all.
Commander.
No answer from the Akagi.
Shall we try again?
No...
Nagumo probably won't.
The Arizona is badly damaged, the Pennsylvania has minor damage, the Nevada nearly sunk, the California sunk four battleships sunk, four battleships destroyed.
America's Pacific fleet is demolished.
No...
They are unhurt.
Their carriers are all unhurt.
Commander, we need to deliver the finishing blow.
Returning all our ships unhurt is part of our duty.
But...
We exit strategic waters now.
All ships turn around and return to port.
They turned around?
What are the mobile units doing?
Commander, let's attack them again.
- That would be an ill-advised attack.
- All attacks are ill-advised!
The goal of this plan is to destroy the enemy fleet, even risking our safety.
However...
Let us abide by Nagumo's judgment.
Commander!
There must be something we can't see from here in Japanese waters.
Listen...
Even robbers are scared to walk home.
He never made it back.
I see!
Every ship in the mobile unit fleet was unhurt.
Yes, there was no damage to any ship.
A battle must be fought to know its outcome.
Cheers!
Fleet Commander Yamamoto, Banzai!
Roosevelt's speech is on.
The Foreign Ministry definitely instructed the Japanese ambassador in Washington to deliver the declaration 30 minutes before the Pearl Harbor attack.
The Embassy staff must have mismanaged...
Mismanaged!
Mismanaged what?
I don't know the details, but ultimately the declaration wasn't delivered until one hour after our attack.
Perhaps the Embassy took more time to translate the Ministry's cable...
Took more time!
Do you mock me?
Does anyone in the Ministry or Military Command understand what this means?
Why did Commander Yamamoto stress...
Officer Miyake.
Sir.
Let's start.
What?
This will be a tough fight.
There.
Commander Yamamoto, we wish you a happy New Year!
Please make another lightning charge this year.
Wonderful, the economy will finally improve.
I can't remember such a refreshing New Year's!
Imperial fleet, Banzai!
Banzai!
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
Incredible.
He used to badmouth the Navy so much.
That ended with last year.
Oh, happy New Year!
Dear Iso, happy New Year
I know you must be working so very hard.
Nagaoka is all wrapped up in a white blanket of snow.
These days, my neighbors stop by nearly every day to talk about you.
They say you're a hero who saved our nation, and they pray every time they hear your name on the radio.
I know you hate that sort of thing more than anyone, but everyone is just so very proud of you that, as your sister,
I just listen to them gratefully.
When springtime comes,
I'll send you more sweets.
Please look forward to them.
Imperial Military Command announces that on February 15th, the British military surrenders on the island of Singapore...
We smashed their Oriental fleet and now Singapore has fallen.
Two months into this war, we are invincible.
The oil in Borneo is ours!
Editor!
Another run of the special edition!
Not since we went to war with China!
Our circulation will increase, too!
Where was that...
You ate 50 tangerines...
Not that many, only 47.
That was in Yugawara.
Pearl Harbor was a failure.
Yeah, a huge failure.
Not a single carrier in sight...
The Yankee spirit is in flames at the sneak attack.
Now they've got a righteous cause against Japan.
But our people are in seventh heaven.
You tried to evade war for them, but they want to go to war.
No doubt they think that wars happen far across the sea.
If the day comes when bombs rain down from the sky, this country will suffer.
You're going after them, one more time?
Yeah, we'll go after Hawaii again.
It won't take America six months to get back on its feet.
Before then, I'll smash their carriers and capture Hawaii.
That's the only way to sue for peace.
But if you bring up suing for peace in these invincible times, the people will faint from shock.
To this country, you're as almighty as God.
If I were God, I wouldn't start a war in the first place.
Admiral Yamamoto, I thank you on behalf of the Japanese people!
Have a seat.
Your victory instantly swept aside the dark clouds oppressing this nation.
You have managed to take revenge for the hardships and humiliations we've tasted since the Black Ships.
America will withdraw from China and Asia will fall into our hands.
Please tell us today about your vision towards final victory.
Sue for peace.
Sue for peace?
The soldier's most important duty is to finish the war he starts.
I'm truly shocked.
You have no idea what the people want now.
What public opinion expects now!
Regardless of public opinion, this country must not be destroyed.
I've wasted my time.
I can't print this as an article.
Excuse me.
You see...
Yes?
No, thank you for your earlier hospitality.
Take a good look at the world around you.
Got that, Shindo?
Yes.
The Yamato is big.
I can't seem to settle down.
Makes me want to hit the town.
Thank you!
SWEETS
That's all you're eating?
Better say what's on your mind.
The Military Command plans to expand the war.
They seem drunk on the initial victories.
Go ahead, eat.
Little girl.
Yes.
Can I have another bowl of sweet soup?
Yes.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
She's just...
No, no, the fault is mine.
I surprised you.
I was reckless when I was young and got hurt.
Now, more sweet soup, please.
Yes.
Thank you so much.
The plan is prepared.
MIDWAY STRATEGY PLAN
This will definitely draw out the carriers.
We'll smash them and capture Hawaii.
Military Command thinks Americans will be based in Australia and come north over the islands to invade Japan.
So they plan to capture Fiji and Samoa to stop their northern advances.
Can our fleet deploy so far?
Apparently the Fleet Commander is still targeting Hawaii.
I see, so the Navy has more than one mind.
Hayakawa, you stay on the Navy Ministry.
The rest of you keep your ears peeled for information from all sources.
This is totally different from Pearl Harbor.
What?
Before that attack, no one leaked any information.
Did we have an air raid drill scheduled today?
Tokyo bombed?
They flew mid-sized bombers from their carriers.
They've staged an airbase near Tokyo...
Fly the No. 1 Carrier Fleet combat squadron to Atsugi to defend Tokyo!
Yes, Sir!
It was a pitiful sight.
So, this is an air raid.
In order to prevent future air raids, the Army, responsible for homeland defense, is demanding that we push the Pacific frontline farther east.
Therefore, I have approved the Midway Plan.
Yes, Sir.
I hear Yamamoto is saying the goal is to lure their aircraft carriers, but the real goal is to capture the Midway Islands.
The priority is to capture it to create a frontline base.
Got that, Nagumo?
Yes, Sir.
We'll destroy the enemy's airbase and land assault troops.
After, we quickly occupy the island.
At the same time, our carriers will standby between Hawaii and Midway.
We'll wait for the enemy aircraft carriers that will surely be lured, and use all our strength to annihilate them.
According to Military Command, capturing the island is their priority.
No, capturing Midway and luring their aircraft carriers are both goals.
The enemy carriers were hard hit in the battle at Coral Sea, two weeks ago.
They won't take the bait.
Even if they do, they're nothing to fear.
What's your evidence?
What?
What evidence do you have that they're nothing to fear?
Well, that's...
Even in Hawaii, which Military Command considers a resounding victory, we lost 55 of our best trained flight crew.
From now on, America won't let us surprise them with any more attacks.
For an officer to assert that the enemy is nothing to fear, is the height of insecurity.
Sir, I apologize.
For the Pacific fleet in Hawaii, Midway is a treasured forward airbase.
If we hammer it, their carriers have to come.
Nagumo.
Yes.
To prepare for their aircraft carriers, load half of the Akagi's fighters with torpedoes and have them standing by.
Understood.
The goal of this plan is to lure the enemy carriers and annihilate them.
No matter what the cost, we cannot ever let enemy planes fly in Japanese skies.
May 27th, 1942.
The battleship Yamato, helmed by Yamamoto, followed Nagumo's Akagi to Midway, joining a giant attack fleet of over 200 ships.
You haven't gotten a raise in pay this past year, have you, Miyake?
Sir...
You went on the attack.
You'll get a bonus next month.
Sir...
If we had stayed in the Inland Sea,
I couldn't give you bonuses or medals.
The military is a complicated business...
Don't you need to load torpedoes onto half of our fighters?
The enemy carriers will never come.
So we don't need to arm torpedoes.
Bombs for capturing Midway are all we need.
Forward at half speed.
Forward at half speed.
I can smell 'em.
There are carriers.
I report.
Our submarines off of Kwajalein Atoll report intercepting enemy carrier signals.
Read it!
The enemy carrier position is 170 sea miles north-north-west of Midway.
I knew they'd come.
Officer, don't you need to let the Akagi know, too?
No, the Akagi should have also received it.
And we're in radio silence.
If we send a cable, the enemy may be able to identify our position.
Right...
Midway Islands, 30 degrees to right.
All planes attack!
Sir, there are no planes on their runway!
They were ready...
Officer, are you sure there are no enemy carriers?
Yes, our six reconnaissance planes have found nothing and the carriers won't come here.
You don't need to worry.
According to reports, the weather near Midway will dramatically improve.
When the clouds clear,
Nagumo will be totally exposed.
Officer Miyake.
Time for a game.
I report!
The first attack squad reports "Bombing results inadequate.
Second attack on Midway required."
That's all.
An Army detachment of 2,000 men are approaching the island.
If they don't all land safely, the Navy's reputation is at stake.
We must launch a second attack immediately.
Emergency report from plane four!
Discovered enemy carrier!
What?
Bearing 10 degrees from Midway, 240 sea miles, 150 degrees course, 20 knots!
That's all.
Distance from mother ship?
Roger.
Let's send the second attack against the enemy carrier.
No, they're only carrying bombs for Midway.
We can blast open their decks.
Why are our fighter planes in the air?
They have to land on our deck to refuel.
We can't afford to.
They can't attack without support!
They're late.
Communications.
Signal the Akagi!
"Approve immediate second attack."
Yes.
Enemy planes estimated arrival, 05:15, in 30 minutes.
Don't panic.
We can deploy all planes in 15 minutes.
Commander...
Bring in the escort planes.
Refit the second attack squadron with torpedoes.
Hurry!
Sir!
Okay, this way!
I'm going down first.
Roger!
Any response from the Akagi?
Nothing.
Less than 20 minutes to enemy planes.
Second attack squadron ready for take-off.
All planes take off!
All planes take off!
Enemy planes in five minutes!
Enemy planes!
Overhead!
Dive-bombing!
Full starboard!
This carrier will attack their carriers.
Signal battle command.
I hereby take over command of the air battle.
Sir.
Listen well.
We will sink one enemy carrier if it costs our lives.
At this rate, the Imperial Navy will be an eternal laughing stock.
Yes, Sir!
4.2 east-south-east...
I will confirm.
Excuse me!
Cable from the Hiryu!
Akagi, Kaga and Soryu, bombed and on fire.
Hiryu is attacking the carriers alone.
They got three of our ships.
Where are the escort squadrons?
Arima!
Enemy planes!
Overhead!
Dive-bombing!
Full starboard!
You all fought hard to the end!
I'm grateful to you!
There's a long war still ahead.
Survive...
Survive!
And put this experience to work, to create a strong Navy!
Go!
Commander!
Get off now!
Commander!
Commander!
Please abandon ship!
Just go now.
They sank four of our carriers.
Someone has to stay behind.
I will stay, too!
I will, too!
I'm plenty.
Hurry, go!
Commander!
A keepsake.
Enough...
Go.
Excuse me.
I report.
After sinking the carrier Yorktown, the Hiryu was set ablaze and sank.
So that's it.
They got the Hiryu.
Also, Commander Yamaguchi went down with the ship.
It's over now...
Let's attack them at night!
We'll never catch up.
And at first light, we'll become a target subjecting the flagship to the enemy's bombs!
I know that, Sir!
This is the second time, following Hawaii.
We can't limp back to port like this.
We can't take the commander back to Japan under these pathetic conditions!
Kuroshima...
Sir!
Enough.
Let's go home to Japan.
Excuse me!
Commander Nagumo is aboard.
Right.
Miyake.
Sir.
Don't blame Nagumo.
I apologize for this outcome.
Eat your rice soup while it's hot.
"American carriers sunk!"
"120 planes attack!"
The Imperial Navy does it again!
Why aren't there any pictures?
There were huge pictures when Singapore fell.
Yeah.
All sinking enemy ships look the same.
Really?
"Our fleet losses were minor."
But a single ship carries hundreds of sailors.
They went down with the ship.
That's just how warfare is...
Good evening.
You were closed today.
You're the man...
I'm so sorry.
Without sugar or beans since the rations, we had to close...
I see...
I'll come back again.
Oh, right.
I'm sorry for scaring you the other day.
My apologies.
It will suit you.
In the waters off Guadalcanal of the Solomon Islands, our Imperial Navy, launched a huge attack, sinking two enemy aircraft carriers...
Despite its great victory at Midway, the Imperial Navy abandoned its plans to capture Hawaii.
Instead, according to their original plans, built an airbase on Guadalcanal, to destroy the invading Americans, heading north, on their way to fortify Australia.
Many Army officers were deployed.
The Imperial Fleet's Command and the flagship Yamato headed south anchoring near Truk Island on the equator.
There's oil on Borneo, but with our tankers getting sunk like this...
No doubt things on Guadalcanal are nightmarish.
They were occupied three months ago.
Never expected the Americans would counterattack so quickly...
Yamamoto saw it coming.
It was the military bureaucrats in command who have no idea...
They always reason so as to match their foregone conclusions.
They don't have a shred of evidence.
I'm sure Yamamoto has it rough out there.
It should have been Singapore.
We missed our chance to sue for peace.
We may have been mistaken...
But still,
Yamamoto hasn't given up.
No matter what, I'm sure he's trying to somehow sue for peace...
You're right.
Yamamoto never gives up...
Over four days, they hammered our 11 battleships, including Kongo, Haruna, Jujun, Aoba and Chokai, with 3,000 shells and completely destroyed our airfield on Guadalcanal.
But the enemy is deploying incredible numbers of reinforcements.
It won't take them long to rebuild the airfield.
What's the condition of the Army?
Following the annihilation of the detachment that landed in August, the 5,000 troops under Kawaguchi's command are already destroyed...
This was the Navy's plan...
We must do something, but...
What?
Excuse me.
It's been a while.
You'll be at the Naval Academy...
I hear you strongly recommended me as director of the Naval Academy.
Really?
I don't think it's right to go home to Japan at a time like this.
Inoue...
Yes.
The academy needs you now more than ever.
What?
If the worst should happen, the young must rebuild our nation.
Train the young.
You can do it.
Just like you once saved the Navy...
It's in your hands.
Yes, Sir.
Our landed troops have run out of food and ammunition.
At this rate, our troops remaining on the island will be annihilated.
The Imperial Fleet still has the Mutsu and the Nagato.
It also has this ship the Yamato, the mightiest in the world.
If we don't fire our big guns now, when do we?
But listen, Kadokura...
We should gather the full fleet for a final massive attack!
Commander Kadokura, excuse me, but we wish for that, too.
Why don't you?
- But...
- But, what?
In truth...
We don't have the fuel.
We will retreat from Guadalcanal.
But the Navy has a responsibility to the Army.
We mobilize every destroyer to rescue as many troops off Guadalcanal as we can.
I'll notify Central Command.
I'll make sure this plan of retreat succeeds...
Commander...
In that case, allow me to escort the destroyers.
Understood.
It's in your hands.
In the three days of strategic retreat, we rescued over 10,000 Army and Navy men.
I see.
But during his command,
Commander Kadokura was killed in battle.
Make sure his family receives his personal effects.
Yes, Sir.
From Imperial Headquarters.
In order to accomplish their mission, the troops fighting on Guadalcanal have been transferred off the island.
Transferred?
Editor, what exactly does "transferred" mean?
It means to proceed elsewhere.
In actuality, doesn't that mean retreat?
Elite Army and Navy troops secured a strategic base on the Solomons.
Therefore, they head to New Guinea, their original goal...
What else is that but a transfer?
Chief.
The public is realizing that Midway was a disastrous defeat.
Isn't our mission to convey the truth to the public?
The mission of our newspapers is to stay ahead of the people and guide their will, even as Japan constructs a new world order.
We report our military's glorious exploits and keep spirits high at home!
Isn't that what's needed?
Is that really our mission?
Shindo.
Right now, every citizen, is fighting together...
Is fighting together!
I'll finish the editorial in two hours.
Okay!
We'll lead with,
"Our elite troops transfer from Guadalcanal."
Yes.
Tell the copydesk.
Yes, I will.
CONGRATULATIONS TO OUR DRAFTEES
April, 1943.
The Imperial Fleet moved its Command to Rabaul, to concentrate its aviator strength.
The newspaper is increasingly filled with "transfers".
One and a half years into this war,
I fear we are headed for a war of attrition, like the war we're fighting against China.
But no one dares say it out loud.
IMPERIAL FLEET COMMAND RABAUL
SAEKI
ARIMA
YAMAGUCHI
KADOKURA
One year and four months into this war, you've all fought hard in tough conditions.
But enemy attacks grow stronger every day.
The Imperial Fleet will now conduct its final battle.
First, we'll consolidate the Rabaul-based air squadrons with all the aircraft carriers in the Third Fleet.
Then we'll annihilate the enemy aviators deployed in the Solomon-New Guinea area.
After that...
We'll immediately reduce our front line.
Are we transferring?
No, it's a retreat.
Words must be used accurately.
We pull back to the Marianas.
We use Guam and Saipan as an unsinkable carrier and fight our final air battle.
With that victory,
we sue for peace...
However, if we retreat our front line, the enemy will launch an all-out attack there.
I didn't say we pull back everything.
We'll keep the front line bases until the rear is prepared.
What about the troops...
Yes, they'll be sacrificed.
It's the final battle, to sue for peace.
Okay, return to base!
Roger!
Mother...
Today, the Igo Plan has ended.
It was a rare victory.
We can now head to the Marianas.
Yes.
Commander.
Lt. Makino died in combat.
I see...
Makino's gone, too...
Chief of Staff,
I'll inspect the front lines on the 18th, too.
No, there are daily enemy attacks on those bases.
You cannot accompany us there.
Mine may be an ugly face, but the troops are happy to see it.
I'm grateful.
Your humble servant has so many of his dear men divided in this world and the next.
I both want them to welcome me there and remain here to serve on earth a little longer...
I am of two minds, but have one body.
Come in.
Excuse me.
What's that scary look for?
Commander Ozawa is insisting that you must not inspect the front lines.
But if you insist, he'll fly as many escort planes as you wish.
Just the usual, please.
Don't blow it out of proportion.
But, Sir...
The usual is fine.
Listen, Miyake.
Sir.
A lot of young men have died.
Japan's youth, who shoulder the future, are all dying first.
I'm an old man, still sticking around...
When I see them again, how am I supposed to greet them?
What's a man to do...
Come in.
Excuse me.
What is it?
I've been drafted into the infantry.
I see.
Akiyama will take over the Imperial War Record.
I understand.
Thank you for everything.
Fight the good fight for your country, Japan.
Yes.
Shindo...
I'll be off.
Hey!
You'll get malaria from the mosquitoes!
Excuse me.
Don't act so shocked.
Even I have a glass of whisky now and then.
It's the midsummer festival I burned the tip of my nose...
Hey, hey, what's that?
I memorized it.
Don't screw it up.
All right, I'll teach you the correct lyrics.
It's the midsummer festival
Time for eggplant rice pot
I burned the tip of my nose
Licking up every scrap
I burned the tip of my nose
Licking up every scrap
How dare you signal the commander's movements!
What if the enemy intercepts it?
We land at the base on Ballale in 15 minutes.
Right.
Enemy planes!
Emergency landing!
Commander!
After pondering the general trends of the world and the actual conditions in our empire today, we have decided to effect a settlement of the present situation by resorting to an extraordinary measure.
We have ordered our government to communicate to the U.S., Great Britain, China, and the Soviet Union, that our empire accepts the provisions of their joint declaration...
Admiral Yamamoto, it's been two years and four months since you died.
And so, the war ended in a manner far removed from the peace you so desired.
Since the war began in Pearl Harbor, some three million have lost their lives to it.
Over 90% of those lives were lost after you died.
After you died on Bougainville, there was no one left in Japan, who could bring the war to an end.
When and how did we go wrong?
And what did we lose?
We will abandon our past, and create a new Japan with America.
This is our greatest mission for the future!
Okay, that's the editorial!
The answer to that may have to wait 50 or 100 years...
Put this word "Democratize" in the biggest font!
Yes.
But that may also be enough time for the people of our country to forget everything.
IMPERIAL WAR RECORD
But Admiral Yamamoto, that you, who opposed the war above all others, were forced to light its fire...
And that you fought all your battles to restore peace as soon as possible...
These facts, I will always remember.
WAR RECORD OF IMPERIAL JAPAN BY SHINDO
Admiral Yamamoto,
I believe we must start over by really looking at the world.
Following your words, by opening our eyes, our ears and our hearts.
Hey, Iso.
At the time of the Boshin Civil War, your grandfather was already 77 years old.
But he bravely charged the enemy.
He died a glorious death.
Our city, Nagaoka, burned for three days and nights.
The whole city burned to ashes.
It was a horrible sight to behold.
That was 20 years ago.
Time does fly...
THE ADMIRAL (ADMIRAL YAMAMOTO)
DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY
Company, halt!
Left turn!
Take aim!
What the hell are you up to!
How dare you aim at the Navy!
How dare you!
Withdraw!
If the Army wants a fight, let us be prepared!
Hurry to the generators!
If they cut off our water and power, 3,000 men won't be able to flush!
Withdraw!
At ease!
Company, advance!
Yes.
Excuse me.
I've ordered a Yokosuka land battalion to stand by.
I see.
The Army is insolent!
To conclude the Tripartite Pact, they're even threatening a coup d'etat.
That was a real scare.
I thought they'd really shoot.
The Army and Navy shooting at each other is no joking matter.
But I trust all is well, Yamamoto?
Yes.
With General Inoue in charge, things will be fine.
Right.
I'll excuse myself, then.
Minister.
Please make no scandalous detours on your way home today.
Right.
Only because you insist.
He'll detour.
Yes, a detour is written all over his face.
Excuse me.
Undersecretary, Chief Editor Munakata of Tokyo Nippo is here.
Oh, it's that time already?
I leave you in charge.
Shindo here was completely panicked that a battle was about to start.
At this rate, we could repeat the tragedy of the February 26 coup from three years ago.
Undersecretary, you should look after your own personal safety.
I appreciate your concern.
Even with things in this state, will the Navy still oppose the Tripartite Pact?
Yes, of course.
Is your reason America?
If we side with Germany, America won't sit still.
Which country stole land from our countrymen with their discriminatory law?
America.
And proposed the League of Nations but refuses to join over the Monroe Doctrine?
America.
On top of that, expands their own colonies, but refuses to acknowledge our rightful national interests in Asia?
As you say.
Why wouldn't you try to sweep aside such a country?
Can you sweep them aside?
It's true.
Their shipbuilding capacity is 4.5 times ours.
For aeroplanes, six times, for cars, 100 times.
For oil, 700 times ours.
In half a day, they produce Japan's annual consumption.
In national strength, America is 10 times stronger than Japan.
Your understanding is correct.
But in the Russo-Japanese war, we beat Russia, also 10 times our might, right?
At the time, Russia was undergoing a revolution.
Thus, we could sue for peace after one victorious battle.
But today, wars are total wars.
It will not end until one side has burned to ashes.
So we should shut up and do America's bidding?
No.
We must boldly assert our nation's conditions and confront our opponents without fear.
But that, should be handled by diplomacy.
That is my point.
Your point is well taken.
But the last resort of diplomacy is war...
Is it not?
Listen, Mr. Munakata, once you start a war, there's no turning back.
We must not bring catastrophe upon our nation by charging without sober deliberation.
So we must grin and bear it?
Even if our people are smothered by this gloomy helplessness?
Isn't it you, who are fanning the flames of this helplessness you refer to?
The newspapers simply represent public opinion.
This public opinion, is it truly the voice of the people?
Right.
Welcome back!
- Shindo, Shindo!
- Yes!
Did you get Undersecretary Yamamoto?
The chief is in his room.
Okay!
He'll write the editorial in time.
Akiyama!
What was Undersecretary Yamamoto like?
He's a mysterious man.
But it's clear the Tripartite Pact is a long way off.
Internally, the Navy is still fighting the Boshin War.
The Boshin War?
The Navy's inner circle come from Satsuma and Choshu clans.
But the minister and the general come from Morioka and Sendai.
And the Undersecretary comes from Nagaoka.
They all fought Satsuma and Choshu.
I see, of course they'll clash.
WAR RECORDS OF IMPERIAL JAPAN
War Records of Imperial Japan.
In 1868, even as the Boshin Civil War raged, our nation entered the new Meiji era, and based on twin victories over Russia and China, grew to be counted among the world's five great nations.
And the Great War, which erupted in the Taisho era, brought our nation unprecedented prosperity.
But as the Showa era dawned, the great depression stormed Japan.
Advancing on Manchuria was Japan's solution.
Ever since, our conflict with China intensified and over the course of seven years of localized combat, domestically, Japan witnessed three major military coups d'etats, spreading social anxiety.
On July 7th, 1937, war with China erupts.
Japan and China are finally in full-scale war.
The Army believed it would win in one month, but the Soviet Union, England, and America all aided Chiang Kai-shek's government and the fighting bogged down.
That was when Germany, under command of Hitler, asked Japan to join the Tripartite Pact with Italy.
For Japan, bogged down in China, it was an extremely attractive offer.
The Japanese people were in a frenzy over Germany's ferocious military advance over Europe.
But despite an avalanche of support for the Tripartite Pact, the Navy's sole opposition managed to prevent its conclusion.
"...to join forces with our German ally,
"to liberate Asia from the grip of the Euro-American powers,
"in order to build the New East Asian Order,
"now is the time for the Navy to decisively support the Tripartite Pact.
"We fervently desire this."
All right, that's the editorial.
Submit this!
Yes!
Yes?
Political Desk.
Aborted assassination?
ASSASSINATION PLOT
UNDERSECRETARY YAMAMOTO TARGET
I demand that the Navy's Yonai, Yamamoto, and Inoue, who all advance
Britain and America's cause, by blocking the Tripartite Pact, so essential to Japanese policy today, all resign immediately!
The Military Police have offered protection.
The usual routine is fine.
The Army's Military Police scare me more.
But, Sir...
The usual routine is fine.
If my death awakens the Japanese people, so be it.
Totally inappropriate!
Don't twist things your way!
Isn't the Tripartite Pact necessary so that Germany can restrain the Soviet Union from invading south!
Incomprehensible!
Do you have any brains in your head?
Why the hell would Germany move to support Japan?
What!
Oh, Sir...
Are you all analysing international affairs?
These naval officers are worse than the Army.
Undersecretary, why do you not acknowledge the strength of our ally, Germany?
Our ally?
You're awfully devoted to Germany.
In that case, I presume you've read Hitler's Mein Kampf?
Every last page.
In other words, the Japanese are an inferior race, lacking in imagination, but they are skilful and clever and perfect for Germany to use!
I never read those words!
Of course not!
Because Chapter 11 in your edition is conveniently deleted!
Unfortunately, it seems an essential part was missing from the Japanese translation you men read.
If you don't trace things back to their source, you can overlook the essentials.
Enter.
Excuse me.
What?
Germany signed a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union.
Your ally has sided with our sworn enemy.
Prime Minister Hiranuma is dissolving the cabinet.
The signing of the non-aggression pact between Germany and the Soviet...
Hitler gave up on Japan because we dithered.
Farewell Tripartite Pact.
War with America will have to wait thanks to the cowards in the Navy.
- Welcome.
- All done with the show?
I'm so hungry.
Noodles please!
At least remove your stage makeup before filling your belly.
Nobody brings me snacks to my dressing room any more.
Not in this economy...
If they don't start a war soon, my factory will go bankrupt.
Say, if a war starts, will the economy really get better?
In the Great War, 20 years ago, the economy quickly recovered.
That's right, war is best.
We're already at war with China.
We can't start wars everywhere.
But it's America that's behind China.
So if we beat America, we can beat China, too.
Exactly!
YAMAMOTO PROMOTED TO FLEET COMMANDER
Six pence!
This one, too.
Minister, the Tripartite Pact negotiations ended, but none of the problems are solved.
Please let me remain and serve as Undersecretary.
But if you stay here in headquarters, you'll run out of lives.
Why don't you spend some time out at sea.
Hey, Inoue.
Thank you for your long service.
I'm grateful.
You forcefully pressured the Ministry into stopping the Tripartite Pact.
You saved the Navy.
No, I had my hands full reining in the youth.
Which left no time for constructive discussions about the future of Japan.
I'm disappointed.
Well...
In the fall, I'll be transferred to the China Sea fleet.
I had hoped that at least you would stay in the Ministry.
Admiral Yamamoto...
Thank you for everything.
Right, we'll meet again.
So you're the Fleet Commander.
You, who never aspired to fame or fortune.
You're unmatched in the Navy, Hori, and much more suited than me.
Won't you take my place?
I'm a civilian now.
They fired me five years ago.
"Fleet in being."
A nation's navy is always defending.
It exists to guarantee peace.
The non-combative fleet you kept lobbying for, is hard to realise.
The current Military Command knows nothing of war and neither do the military planners.
It's impossible to persuade them.
Hori...
Yeah?
Take my place?
It's been five years since I've been to sea.
September, 1939,
Yamamoto bid farewell to the Navy Ministry.
And he assumed his post as Fleet Commander on the flagship, Nagato, based on Hashira Island in the Inland Sea.
Just then, the blitzkrieg struck Europe.
Germany finally launched its attack against Poland.
In response, England and France declared war.
The peace in Europe did not even last 20 years, and eight months passed in this new Second World War.
Meanwhile, under Yamamoto's command, the Japanese fleet improved the performance of its aircraft carriers, vigorously training its carrier-based planes.
May, 1940,
Germany broke its inaction and began invading again.
Quickly conquering Belgium and Holland, in one month, it occupied Paris.
It was an overwhelming victory, a "blitzkrieg" in every sense.
As though in concert with Germany's blitzkrieg, voices called anew for the Tripartite Pact in Japan.
The Germans can't seem to be stopped.
Once our Yamato battleship is built, we'll be invincible.
Chief of Staff, the future belongs to aeroplanes.
We could build 1 ,000 planes for the price of one of your battleships.
Listen, the history of our Japanese Navy is built on battles at sea...
These Inland Sea sardines are tasty.
Yes.
Both of you hail from the Inland Sea area, don't you?
Yes.
I'm envious.
Your fish are tasty to the bone.
Where did you get these, the sweet dumplings!
Sweet dumplings?
Enter, Makino.
Excuse me.
I'm Ensign Makino, who served under you at Kasumigaura Air Corps.
I assumed my position on the Akagi's combat unit yesterday.
Good to hear.
Is this your doing?
Yes!
I was given leave and went home to Nagaoka.
They're my mother's homemade dumplings.
Try some.
Sugar on sweet dumplings?
That's right.
Is your mother well?
She is delighted that I will be working under your command.
Tasty.
Enjoy.
Thanks.
Saeki, your rear!
Oh, no, rats!
Great!
Victory!
Arima, stay focused on your rear!
Yes!
Always a battlefield?
Yes, it means endeavour in everything as though you are at war.
But the Nagaoka samurai have three principles.
Three?
The second is Kawai's spirit of duty.
Kawai fought to the bitter end, never forgetting his debt to the Shogunate.
- Tokugawa?
- Debt?
Yes.
Thirdly, the spirit of 100 bushels of rice.
One hundred bushels of rice?
Even after the battle was lost and our clansmen were starving, our clan clung to the gift of 100 bushels of rice, building a school with its profit.
When everyone was starving?
A hundred bushels of rice are gone if you eat them.
But if you spend it on people, it can grow to be 10,000 bushels.
If you are to lead men, always consider the future.
ALWAYS A BATTLEFIELD
100,000 men.
What?
We lost 100,000 men in the Russo-Japanese war.
But after 20 or 30 years, everyone quickly forgets.
The newspapers and the people.
Being good at forgetting is one of our people's strengths, as well.
- Please.
- I know.
In order to participate in Germany's new world economy, now is the time to conclude the Tripartite Pact.
We must not miss this bus...
The Tripartite Pact, is now an agreement between four nations, including the Soviet Union, and confronted with these four nations, even America will reconsider its disrespect.
We are done with the weak-willed Navy!
Now is the time to conclude the Tripartite Pact!
Don't miss the bus!
Listen, Navy Minister!
MINISTRY OF THE NAVY
I have onlyjust taken Yoshida's place as Navy Minister, but political stagnation must not be permitted.
If the Navy persists in opposing the Tripartite Pact,
Konoe's cabinet will be forced to resign and we cannot be held to blame.
Therefore, I reluctantly propose that we revise our policy.
I hope that you officers will join my support for the Tripartite Pact.
Any objections?
Please wait.
I swear total allegiance to your command, Minister.
But I do have some concerns, so let me ask you, if the Tripartite Pact is concluded, the chances of a conflict with America increase.
Currently, our lack of aviators is apparent.
If we do go to war with America, we will need 1 ,000 fighter planes and 1 ,000 bombers.
In other words, we must double our current plane strength.
But our country relies on America for steel, oil and other manufacturing resources.
If we sign with Germany now, we will inevitably lose all of that.
In which case, how have you revised your plans, to compensate for that loss?
Please tell me.
We will await the future deliberations of each department...
Minister, that is not an answer.
Please tell me the reason why you think a war against America is possible.
I'm sure you have your opinions, but the majority is in favour, so...
Excuse me.
A telegram from the commander.
"Begin planning the attack."
I'm home!
Oh, my.
Welcome home.
Yes.
Thanks for the food.
Yoshimasa, pickles are for the end of the meal.
Yes.
Take a sip of miso soup before you eat rice.
What's most important is to clean your plate and eat your fill.
Yes.
Here, Yoshimasa.
Here.
Thank you.
Here, Sumi.
There you go.
Thank you.
Here, Ma.
Thank you.
Here, Tadao.
Thank you.
Here, Mother.
Thank you.
Commander Yamamoto, it seems we'll finallyjoin the Tripartite Pact.
"The national defence
"is to provide requisite armed forces, but also to grow national strength,
"while using diplomacy to evade war.
"That is the essence of national defence.
"In other words,
"the national defence is not exclusive to soldiers..."
Those are the words of Admiral Kato, who, taking Japan's future into consideration, decided to sign the Washington Disarmament Treaty, limiting naval armaments.
The words of that notorious Prime Minister Kato who created the flip-flop cabinet.
September 27th, 1940.
The Tripartite Pact which shook our nation for three years, was finally concluded.
The bus Japan climbed on has taken off, engines gunning.
Who's in my plane?
Commander.
I wish this could fly to Monaco.
Excuse me, Sir!
There's a gambling den called a casino.
If I hadn't become a sailor, I'd have made my fortune there.
I see.
Commander, may I ask you a question?
I boarded your plane, I guess I have to answer you.
What?
As a man from Nagaoka, I can understand Kawai's spirit of study.
Indeed...
Always remember the debt to the Shogunate and fight to the bitter end.
But the Shogunate ended years ago.
What are we to feel indebted to today?
To our parents who gave birth to us.
And our birthplace which nurtured their lives.
In other words, our country.
It means we must labour for Japan.
Yes, Sir.
Excuse me.
Yes.
I've brought Admiral Nagumo.
I'm assuming my new duties.
Through strenuous efforts, I will execute my duties.
Right.
It's been a while.
Care to stay for supper?
No, I must return to my new duties on the Akagi.
I see.
In other words, Nagumo commands the No. 1 Aircraft Carrier Fleet, while commanding the combat planes on the Akagi and the Kaga.
While Yamaguchi commands the No. 2 Aircraft Carrier Fleet.
The Navy made a radical personnel assignment.
Is there a problem?
Nagumo is a pure "fleet faction" man who pushed hard to expand the fleet.
He's the one who shoved Hori, a "treaty faction" man, into early retirement.
Oh, Vice Admiral Hori, renowned as a rare talent that could lead the Navy.
And Hori was Yamamoto's classmate and his closest friend.
There is no way that Yamamoto and Nagumo will get along.
Commander Yamamoto has it rough with Nagumo in charge of his combat planes.
Indeed.
Hello, political desk.
Germany voided its non-aggression pact with the Soviets!
What!
Turn the radio on.
...is advancing to the Eastern Front.
I repeat.
Early yesterday, Germany announced it is voiding its non-aggression pact.
Nazi military forces are marching to the Eastern Front, heading for Moscow.
With the sudden Germany/Soviet conflict, Munakata couldn't leave the office, so I took the liberty of coming in his stead.
The bus seems to be racing in an unexpected direction.
The route is somewhat off course, but as Munakata writes in his editorials, if Germany manages to crush the Soviets, our greatest northern threat disappears.
This bus has no choice but to keep running.
How far will it run?
What?
I'm asking, what is its destination?
The Great East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere.
If there really is such a place, I'd sure like to visit it once.
The job of a newspaper is to witness and listen to new global developments and convey them widely.
Open wide your eyes, your ears and your heart when you look around the world.
That's the duty of those who shoulder the next generation, Shindo.
War Records of Imperial Japan.
Attack on Franco-lndonesia.
In July, 1941, in order to secure natural resources, the Imperial Navy finally invaded the French colony of Indonesia.
To retaliate, America stopped all exports of steel, oil and other essential resources to Japan...
Relations between Japan and America have now become extremely volatile.
In the unlikely event we go to war against America and England, how will we be able to end hostilities?
Prime Minister, it's true that America is a powerful nation.
Even if we do win a decisive victory at sea, they will not easily surrender and we must anticipate a long war.
But if Germany wins decisively over Europe and the Soviets,
American public opinion will change dramatically, and there is the possibility that it will end the war.
Possibility?
A battle must be fought to know its outcome.
Finally made it in under 15 minutes.
On our ship, Hiryu, we'll clock even shorter times.
It's you, Yamaguchi.
I heard you were inspecting the combat squadrons and arrived to assist you.
Liar, you just want to eat the Navy's best chow, here on the Nagato.
There's that, too.
Can it not be stopped?
It seems not.
Since when did the Navy start to favour battle?
I wonder...
A soldier must follow orders, but...
By the time you command this fleet, the Navy will change.
No, I believe you are the commander who will change the Navy.
Too slow!
Sixty seconds between descending planes.
Saeki, don't look at your altimeter!
Eyeball it!
Sir!
Makino!
Commander!
Your squadron leader is from Nagaoka.
I bet he's tough!
Sir!
Where are you from?
Sir, I'm from Kagoshima!
Yamaguchi!
From Satsuma and Choshu!
The future of Japan rests on your shoulders!
Work hard!
Yes, Sir!
Nagaoka, Satsuma and Choshu!
Work together to defend Japan!
Yes, Sir!
Special edition!
Tojo's Prime Minister!
Give me one.
Two pence.
We keep getting new prime ministers.
We've had nine in five years.
That's good.
We finally have an Army general as prime minister.
Finally, Japan's going to war.
But can we really beat America?
First, it was the Mongols, then the Chinese, the Russians and the Great War.
When Japan fights a foreign war, we always win!
The country may win, but people still die.
My nephew died in China last year.
They haven't even sent his bones home.
"Navy representative to the London Naval Treaty negotiations..."
Here.
Thanks.
Still researching Yamamoto?
Yes.
We fought China when he was 10, Russia when he was 20.
He graduated naval academy in time for the Battle of Tsushima.
He lost two fingers from his left hand from Russian cannon fire.
So Yamamoto was the first sailor the Navy commended for being wounded.
The Great War at 30, the Manchurian Incident at 47, war starts with China at 53, and when he becomes Fleet Commander at 55 war breaks out in Europe on the very next day.
The path of Yamamoto's life is in itself Imperial Japan's War Record.
"Navy Orders No. 1.
"Orders to Fleet Commander Yamamoto.
"First, in order to defend itself, our empire
"will make all strategic preparations necessary
"to attack America, England and Holland in early December.
"Second, the Fleet Commander
"will implement all strategic preparations..."
It's the midsummer festival
Time for eggplant rice pot
I burned the tip of my nose licking up every scrap...
I find it pathetic that this is my ordered fate.
It's too late to lay blame at anyone's feet.
My current position, in which I must resolve to violate all my personal convictions as I work without distractions is very odd indeed...
This is part of my fate.
Fate is cruel.
Excuse me.
The outline of the strategy is ready.
PEARL HARBOR ATTACK PLANS
Right.
The giant force will consist of six aircraft carriers and 350 carrier-based aeroplanes.
It will converge in the bay of Eto Island and head east across the Pacific.
Then it will head due south to 200 naval miles off Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.
The carrier-based planes will attack Pearl Harbor with torpedoes, horizontal bombing and dive-bombing.
It will destroy America's Pacific fleet, anchoring at port.
But aren't the seas of the Northern Pacific dangerously rough in winter?
- That is what the enemy assumes.
- What about re-supplies?
We are currently improving plans for re-supplying at sea.
There are problems with the attack.
Pearl Harbor bay is only 12 metres deep.
If we drop torpedoes, they'll hit the ocean floor.
We're adapting our torpedoes to compensate.
This is too big a gamble!
We stick with the command's strategy, attacking the southern oilfields first!
What if enemy planes start bombing the Japanese homeland, while we're focused on the southern oilfields?
That's...
This strategy is not a gamble.
If we have to go to war with America, we have to destroy their carriers first.
If we free up their mobile units, they'll stage an airbase near Tokyo.
Japan's skies will become vulnerable.
America is currently building 200 warships.
Compared to them, we can only build 30 in the next three years.
If we have no choice but to fight them, we attack first, prepared for annihilation.
We ferociously attack their main fleet, pummelling the American Navy and the American will to fight
with the vigour of our fighting spirit and then immediately sue for peace.
Early peace.
There is no other path to Japan's survival.
Even if we die upon each other's sword, we must destroy the enemy's jewels.
If this should fail, our country will perish.
The Hawaii plan represents my conviction.
MINISTRY OF THE NAVY
Yamamoto's talking about preparing for annihilation, but a war with America will be long.
Nagumo, return with my fleet intact.
Don't let a single ship sink.
Yes, Sir.
Hello.
Thanks for your business.
Welcome home.
What's that, snapper?
Mother ordered it after you called.
Where is she?
She's sick in bed, with a bad cold.
Oh, I see.
One, two, one, two...
I'm so sorry.
Do you have a fever?
I'm over it now.
Let us eat.
Thanks for the food.
Stay in bed.
No...
When I graduated artillery school, the Meiji Emperor gave this to me.
The coded telegram fixing the date of this strategy is,
"Nii Takayama Nobore."
However, if the on-going negotiations in Washington reach agreement, even after the planes have taken off from their carrier, they must turn back.
That's impossible.
They can't turn back with the enemy in their sights.
The men won't stand for it.
What do you think is the reason we foster and train our soldiers?
It is solely to defend our nation's peace!
If an officer believes he cannot turn back after receiving this order,
I forbid your deployment.
Submit your resignation, now!
Also, in the unlikely event that we must go to war, you shall not bomb civilian residential areas.
Drill that into your guts.
Commander, about the plan to storm the bay with miniature submarines?
Can they safely accommodate the crews?
No, not yet...
In that case, I can't approve that plan.
I can tolerate desperate plans but not one with no chance of survival.
I understand.
Please confirm with Military Command.
In the event we go to war, make sure to send a final warning to America.
They must swear to send this.
Yes.
When Japanese samurai strike an enemy at night, at least they kick his pillow
to awaken him first.
If we attack before a final warning is delivered, the Japanese Navy's name will be ruined.
December 8th, 1941.
The giant attack force of 350 planes taking off from six aircraft carriers attacked the American Pacific fleet anchored at Pearl Harbor.
This raised the curtain on the Pacific War.
I can see the fleet.
All planes attack!
Enemy planes, Sir!
Ready.
Ready!
Sir, there are no carriers!
No.
There aren't.
Telegram from Hawaii.
"Tora Tora Tora!
Surprise attack succeeds!"
Officer Fujii.
I know I repeat myself, but make sure to confirm they delivered the declaration of war.
Yes, Sir.
Squadron leader!
Oh, you're well.
Yes!
Where's Saeki?
He's not back yet.
He should be soon...
We sighted no carriers in the bay.
We couldn't attack their fuel tanks.
Please let us make a second attack.
I report!
From Commander Yamaguchi of the No. 2 Carrier Fleet.
"I confirm the need for a second attack!" That's all.
Commander.
No answer from the Akagi.
Shall we try again?
No...
Nagumo probably won't.
The Arizona is badly damaged, the Pennsylvania has minor damage, the Nevada nearly sunk, the California sunk four battleships sunk, four battleships destroyed.
America's Pacific fleet is demolished.
No...
They are unhurt.
Their carriers are all unhurt.
Commander, we need to deliver the finishing blow.
Returning all our ships unhurt is part of our duty.
But...
We exit strategic waters now.
All ships turn around and return to port.
They turned around?
What are the mobile units doing?
Commander, let's attack them again.
- That would be an ill-advised attack.
- All attacks are ill-advised!
The goal of this plan is to destroy the enemy fleet, even risking our safety.
However...
Let us abide by Nagumo's judgement.
Commander!
There must be something we can't see from here in Japanese waters.
Listen...
Even robbers are scared to walk home.
He never made it back.
I see!
Every ship in the mobile unit fleet was unhurt.
Yes, there was no damage to any ship.
A battle must be fought to know its outcome.
Cheers!
Fleet Commander Yamamoto, Banzai!
Roosevelt's speech is on.
The Foreign Ministry definitely instructed the Japanese ambassador in Washington to deliver the declaration 30 minutes before the Pearl Harbor attack.
The Embassy staff must have mismanaged...
Mismanaged!
Mismanaged what?
I don't know the details, but ultimately the declaration wasn't delivered until one hour after our attack.
Perhaps the Embassy took more time to translate the Ministry's cable...
Took more time!
Do you mock me?
Does anyone in the Ministry or Military Command understand what this means?
Why did Commander Yamamoto stress...
Officer Miyake.
Sir.
Let's start.
What?
This will be a tough fight.
There.
Commander Yamamoto, we wish you a happy New Year!
Please make another lightning charge this year.
Wonderful, the economy will finally improve.
I can't remember such a refreshing New Year's!
Imperial fleet, Banzai!
Banzai!
Happy New Year.
Incredible.
He used to badmouth the Navy so much.
That ended with last year.
Oh, happy New Year!
Dear Iso, happy New Year
I know you must be working so very hard.
Nagaoka is all wrapped up in a white blanket of snow.
These days, my neighbours stop by nearly every day to talk about you.
They say you're a hero who saved our nation, and they pray every time they hear your name on the radio.
I know you hate that sort of thing more than anyone, but everyone is just so very proud of you that, as your sister,
I just listen to them gratefully.
When springtime comes,
I'll send you more sweets.
Please look forward to them.
Imperial Military Command announces that on February 15th, the British military surrenders on the island of Singapore...
We smashed their Oriental fleet and now Singapore has fallen.
Two months into this war, we are invincible.
The oil in Borneo is ours!
Editor!
Another run of the special edition!
Not since we went to war with China!
Our circulation will increase, too!
Where was that...
You ate 50 tangerines...
Not that many, only 47.
That was in Yugawara.
Pearl Harbor was a failure.
Yeah, a huge failure.
Not a single carrier in sight...
The Yankee spirit is in flames at the sneak attack.
Now they've got a righteous cause against Japan.
But our people are in seventh heaven.
You tried to evade war for them, but they want to go to war.
No doubt they think that wars happen far across the sea.
If the day comes when bombs rain down from the sky, this country will suffer.
You're going after them, one more time?
Yeah, we'll go after Hawaii again.
It won't take America six months to get back on its feet.
Before then, I'll smash their carriers and capture Hawaii.
That's the only way to sue for peace.
But if you bring up suing for peace in these invincible times, the people will faint from shock.
To this country, you're as almighty as God.
If I were God, I wouldn't start a war in the first place.
Admiral Yamamoto, I thank you on behalf of the Japanese people!
Have a seat.
Your victory instantly swept aside the dark clouds oppressing this nation.
You have managed to take revenge for the hardships and humiliations we've tasted since the Black Ships.
America will withdraw from China and Asia will fall into our hands.
Please tell us today about your vision towards final victory.
Sue for peace.
Sue for peace?
The soldier's most important duty is to finish the war he starts.
I'm truly shocked.
You have no idea what the people want now.
What public opinion expects now!
Regardless of public opinion, this country must not be destroyed.
I've wasted my time.
I can't print this as an article.
Excuse me.
You see...
Yes?
No, thank you for your earlier hospitality.
Take a good look at the world around you.
Got that, Shindo?
Yes.
The Yamato is big.
I can't seem to settle down.
Makes me want to hit the town.
Thank you!
SWEETS
That's all you're eating?
Better say what's on your mind.
The Military Command plans to expand the war.
They seem drunk on the initial victories.
Go ahead, eat.
Little girl.
Yes.
Can I have another bowl of sweet soup?
Yes.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
She's just...
No, no, the fault is mine.
I surprised you.
I was reckless when I was young and got hurt.
Now, more sweet soup, please.
Yes.
Thank you so much.
The plan is prepared.
MIDWAY STRATEGY PLAN
This will definitely draw out the carriers.
We'll smash them and capture Hawaii.
Military Command thinks Americans will be based in Australia and come north over the islands to invade Japan.
So they plan to capture Fiji and Samoa to stop their northern advances.
Can our fleet deploy so far?
Apparently the Fleet Commander is still targeting Hawaii.
I see, so the Navy has more than one mind.
Hayakawa, you stay on the Navy Ministry.
The rest of you keep your ears peeled for information from all sources.
This is totally different from Pearl Harbor.
What?
Before that attack, no one leaked any information.
Did we have an air raid drill scheduled today?
Tokyo bombed?
They flew mid-sized bombers from their carriers.
They've staged an airbase near Tokyo...
Fly the No. 1 Carrier Fleet combat squadron to Atsugi to defend Tokyo!
Yes, Sir!
It was a pitiful sight.
So, this is an air raid.
In order to prevent future air raids, the Army, responsible for homeland defence, is demanding that we push the Pacific frontline farther east.
Therefore, I have approved the Midway Plan.
Yes, Sir.
I hear Yamamoto is saying the goal is to lure their aircraft carriers, but the real goal is to capture the Midway Islands.
The priority is to capture it to create a frontline base.
Got that, Nagumo?
Yes, Sir.
We'll destroy the enemy's airbase and land assault troops.
After, we quickly occupy the island.
At the same time, our carriers will standby between Hawaii and Midway.
We'll wait for the enemy aircraft carriers that will surely be lured, and use all our strength to annihilate them.
According to Military Command, capturing the island is their priority.
No, capturing Midway and luring their aircraft carriers are both goals.
The enemy carriers were hard hit in the battle at Coral Sea, two weeks ago.
They won't take the bait.
Even if they do, they're nothing to fear.
What's your evidence?
What?
What evidence do you have that they're nothing to fear?
Well, that's...
Even in Hawaii, which Military Command considers a resounding victory, we lost 55 of our best trained flight crew.
From now on, America won't let us surprise them with any more attacks.
For an officer to assert that the enemy is nothing to fear, is the height of insecurity.
Sir, I apologise.
For the Pacific fleet in Hawaii, Midway is a treasured forward airbase.
If we hammer it, their carriers have to come.
Nagumo.
Yes.
To prepare for their aircraft carriers, load half of the Akagi's fighters with torpedoes and have them standing by.
Understood.
The goal of this plan is to lure the enemy carriers and annihilate them.
No matter what the cost, we cannot ever let enemy planes fly in Japanese skies.
May 27th, 1942.
The battleship Yamato, helmed by Yamamoto, followed Nagumo's Akagi to Midway, joining a giant attack fleet of over 200 ships.
You haven't gotten a raise in pay this past year, have you, Miyake?
Sir...
You went on the attack.
You'll get a bonus next month.
Sir...
If we had stayed in the Inland Sea,
I couldn't give you bonuses or medals.
The military is a complicated business...
Don't you need to load torpedoes onto half of our fighters?
The enemy carriers will never come.
So we don't need to arm torpedoes.
Bombs for capturing Midway are all we need.
Forward at half speed.
I can smell 'em.
There are carriers.
I report.
Our submarines off of Kwajalein Atoll report intercepting enemy carrier signals.
Read it!
The enemy carrier position is 170 sea miles north-north-west of Midway.
I knew they'd come.
Officer, don't you need to let the Akagi know, too?
No, the Akagi should have also received it.
And we're in radio silence.
If we send a cable, the enemy may be able to identify our position.
Right...
Midway Islands, 30 degrees to right.
All planes attack!
Sir, there are no planes on their runway!
They were ready...
Officer, are you sure there are no enemy carriers?
Yes, our six reconnaissance planes have found nothing and the carriers won't come here.
You don't need to worry.
According to reports, the weather near Midway will dramatically improve.
When the clouds clear,
Nagumo will be totally exposed.
Officer Miyake.
Time for a game.
I report!
The first attack squad reports "Bombing results inadequate.
Second attack on Midway required."
That's all.
An Army detachment of 2,000 men are approaching the island.
If they don't all land safely, the Navy's reputation is at stake.
We must launch a second attack immediately.
Emergency report from plane four!
Discovered enemy carrier!
What?
Bearing 10 degrees from Midway, 240 sea miles, 150 degrees course, 20 knots!
That's all.
Distance from mother ship?
Roger.
Let's send the second attack against the enemy carrier.
No, they're only carrying bombs for Midway.
We can blast open their decks.
Why are our fighter planes in the air?
They have to land on our deck to refuel.
We can't afford to.
They can't attack without support!
They're late.
Communications.
Signal the Akagi!
"Approve immediate second attack."
Yes.
Enemy planes estimated arrival, 05:15, in 30 minutes.
Don't panic.
We can deploy all planes in 15 minutes.
Commander...
Bring in the escort planes.
Refit the second attack squadron with torpedoes.
Hurry!
Sir!
Okay, this way!
I'm going down first.
Roger!
Any response from the Akagi?
Nothing.
Less than 20 minutes to enemy planes.
Second attack squadron ready for take-off.
All planes take off!
Enemy planes in five minutes!
Enemy planes!
Overhead!
Dive-bombing!
Full starboard!
This carrier will attack their carriers.
Signal battle command.
I hereby take over command of the air battle.
Sir.
Listen well.
We will sink one enemy carrier if it costs our lives.
At this rate, the Imperial Navy will be an eternal laughing stock.
Yes, Sir!
4.2 east-south-east...
I will confirm.
Excuse me!
Cable from the Hiryu!
Akagi, Kaga and Soryu, bombed and on fire.
Hiryu is attacking the carriers alone.
They got three of our ships.
Where are the escort squadrons?
Arima!
Enemy planes!
Overhead!
Dive-bombing!
Full starboard!
You all fought hard to the end!
I'm grateful to you!
There's a long war still ahead.
Survive...
Survive!
And put this experience to work, to create a strong Navy!
Go!
Commander!
Get off now!
Commander!
Commander!
Please abandon ship!
Just go now.
They sank four of our carriers.
Someone has to stay behind.
I will stay, too!
I will, too!
I'm plenty.
Hurry, go!
Commander!
A keepsake.
Enough...
Go.
Excuse me.
I report.
After sinking the carrier Yorktown, the Hiryu was set ablaze and sank.
So that's it.
They got the Hiryu.
Also, Commander Yamaguchi went down with the ship.
It's over now...
Let's attack them at night!
We'll never catch up.
And at first light, we'll become a target subjecting the flagship to the enemy's bombs!
I know that, Sir!
This is the second time, following Hawaii.
We can't limp back to port like this.
We can't take the commander back to Japan under these pathetic conditions!
Kuroshima...
Sir!
Enough.
Let's go home to Japan.
Excuse me!
Commander Nagumo is aboard.
Right.
Miyake.
Sir.
Don't blame Nagumo.
I apologise for this outcome.
Eat your rice soup while it's hot.
"American carriers sunk!"
"120 planes attack!"
The Imperial Navy does it again!
Why aren't there any pictures?
There were huge pictures when Singapore fell.
Yeah.
All sinking enemy ships look the same.
Really?
"Our fleet losses were minor."
But a single ship carries hundreds of sailors.
They went down with the ship.
That's just how warfare is...
Good evening.
You were closed today.
You're the man...
I'm so sorry.
Without sugar or beans since the rations, we had to close...
I see...
I'll come back again.
Oh, right.
I'm sorry for scaring you the other day.
My apologies.
It will suit you.
In the waters off Guadalcanal of the Solomon Islands, our Imperial Navy, launched a huge attack, sinking two enemy aircraft carriers...
Despite its great victory at Midway, the Imperial Navy abandoned its plans to capture Hawaii.
Instead, according to their original plans, built an airbase on Guadalcanal, to destroy the invading Americans, heading north, on their way to fortify Australia.
Many Army officers were deployed.
The Imperial Fleet's Command and the flagship Yamato headed south anchoring near Truk Island on the equator.
There's oil on Borneo, but with our tankers getting sunk like this...
No doubt things on Guadalcanal are nightmarish.
They were occupied three months ago.
Never expected the Americans would counterattack so quickly...
Yamamoto saw it coming.
It was the military bureaucrats in command who have no idea...
They always reason so as to match their foregone conclusions.
They don't have a shred of evidence.
I'm sure Yamamoto has it rough out there.
It should have been Singapore.
We missed our chance to sue for peace.
We may have been mistaken...
But still,
Yamamoto hasn't given up.
No matter what, I'm sure he's trying to somehow sue for peace...
You're right.
Yamamoto never gives up...
Over four days, they hammered our 11 battleships, including Kongo, Haruna, Jujun, Aoba and Chokai, with 3,000 shells and completely destroyed our airfield on Guadalcanal.
But the enemy is deploying incredible numbers of reinforcements.
It won't take them long to rebuild the airfield.
What's the condition of the Army?
Following the annihilation of the detachment that landed in August, the 5,000 troops under Kawaguchi's command are already destroyed...
This was the Navy's plan...
We must do something, but...
What?
Excuse me.
It's been a while.
You'll be at the Naval Academy...
I hear you strongly recommended me as director of the Naval Academy.
Really?
I don't think it's right to go home to Japan at a time like this.
Inoue...
Yes.
The academy needs you now more than ever.
What?
If the worst should happen, the young must rebuild our nation.
Train the young.
You can do it.
Just like you once saved the Navy...
It's in your hands.
Yes, Sir.
Our landed troops have run out of food and ammunition.
At this rate, our troops remaining on the island will be annihilated.
The Imperial Fleet still has the Mutsu and the Nagato.
It also has this ship the Yamato, the mightiest in the world.
If we don't fire our big guns now, when do we?
But listen, Kadokura...
We should gather the full fleet for a final massive attack!
Commander Kadokura, excuse me, but we wish for that, too.
Why don't you?
- But...
- But, what?
In truth...
We don't have the fuel.
We will retreat from Guadalcanal.
But the Navy has a responsibility to the Army.
We mobilise every destroyer to rescue as many troops off Guadalcanal as we can.
I'll notify Central Command.
I'll make sure this plan of retreat succeeds...
Commander...
In that case, allow me to escort the destroyers.
Understood.
It's in your hands.
In the three days of strategic retreat, we rescued over 10,000 Army and Navy men.
I see.
But during his command,
Commander Kadokura was killed in battle.
Make sure his family receives his personal effects.
Yes, Sir.
From Imperial Headquarters.
In order to accomplish their mission, the troops fighting on Guadalcanal have been transferred off the island.
Transferred?
Editor, what exactly does "transferred" mean?
It means to proceed elsewhere.
In actuality, doesn't that mean retreat?
Elite Army and Navy troops secured a strategic base on the Solomons.
Therefore, they head to New Guinea, their original goal...
What else is that but a transfer?
Chief.
The public is realising that Midway was a disastrous defeat.
Isn't our mission to convey the truth to the public?
The mission of our newspapers is to stay ahead of the people and guide their will, even as Japan constructs a new world order.
We report our military's glorious exploits and keep spirits high at home!
Isn't that what's needed?
Is that really our mission?
Shindo.
Right now, every citizen, is fighting together...
Is fighting together!
I'll finish the editorial in two hours.
Okay!
We'll lead with,
"Our elite troops transfer from Guadalcanal."
Yes.
Tell the copydesk.
Yes, I will.
CONGRATULATIONS TO OUR DRAFTEES
April, 1943.
The Imperial Fleet moved its Command to Rabaul, to concentrate its aviator strength.
The newspaper is increasingly filled with "transfers".
One and a half years into this war,
I fear we are headed for a war of attrition, like the war we're fighting against China.
But no one dares say it out loud.
IMPERIAL FLEET COMMAND RABAUL
SAEKI
ARIMA
YAMAGUCHI
KADOKURA
One year and four months into this war, you've all fought hard in tough conditions.
But enemy attacks grow stronger every day.
The Imperial Fleet will now conduct its final battle.
First, we'll consolidate the Rabaul-based air squadrons with all the aircraft carriers in the Third Fleet.
Then we'll annihilate the enemy aviators deployed in the Solomon-New Guinea area.
After that...
We'll immediately reduce our front line.
Are we transferring?
No, it's a retreat.
Words must be used accurately.
We pull back to the Marianas.
We use Guam and Saipan as an unsinkable carrier and fight our final air battle.
With that victory,
we sue for peace...
However, if we retreat our front line, the enemy will launch an all-out attack there.
I didn't say we pull back everything.
We'll keep the front line bases until the rear is prepared.
What about the troops...
Yes, they'll be sacrificed.
It's the final battle, to sue for peace.
Okay, return to base!
Roger!
Mother...
Today, the Igo Plan has ended.
It was a rare victory.
We can now head to the Marianas.
Yes.
Commander.
Lt. Makino died in combat.
I see...
Makino's gone, too...
Chief of Staff,
I'll inspect the front lines on the 18th, too.
No, there are daily enemy attacks on those bases.
You cannot accompany us there.
Mine may be an ugly face, but the troops are happy to see it.
I'm grateful.
Your humble servant has so many of his dear men divided in this world and the next.
I both want them to welcome me there and remain here to serve on earth a little longer...
I am of two minds, but have one body.
Come in.
Excuse me.
What's that scary look for?
Commander Ozawa is insisting that you must not inspect the front lines.
But if you insist, he'll fly as many escort planes as you wish.
Just the usual, please.
Don't blow it out of proportion.
But, Sir...
The usual is fine.
Listen, Miyake.
Sir.
A lot of young men have died.
Japan's youth, who shoulder the future, are all dying first.
I'm an old man, still sticking around...
When I see them again,
how am I supposed to greet them?
What's a man to do...
Come in.
Excuse me.
What is it?
I've been drafted into the infantry.
I see.
Akiyama will take over the Imperial War Record.
I understand.
Thank you for everything.
Fight the good fight for your country, Japan.
Yes.
Shindo...
I'll be off.
Hey!
You'll get malaria from the mosquitoes!
Excuse me.
Don't act so shocked.
Even I have a glass of whisky now and then.
It's the midsummer festival I burned the tip of my nose...
Hey, hey, what's that?
I memorised it.
Don't screw it up.
All right, I'll teach you the correct lyrics.
It's the midsummer festival
Time for eggplant rice pot
I burned the tip of my nose
Licking up every scrap
I burned the tip of my nose
Licking up every scrap
How dare you signal the commander's movements!
What if the enemy intercepts it?
We land at the base on Ballale in 15 minutes.
Right.
Enemy planes!
Emergency landing!
Commander!
After pondering the general trends of the world and the actual conditions in our empire today, we have decided to effect a settlement of the present situation by resorting to an extraordinary measure.
We have ordered our government to communicate to the U.S., Great Britain, China, and the Soviet Union, that our empire accepts the provisions of theirjoint declaration...
Admiral Yamamoto, it's been two years and four months since you died.
And so, the war ended in a manner far removed from the peace you so desired.
Since the war began in Pearl Harbor, some three million have lost their lives to it.
Over 90% of those lives were lost after you died.
After you died on Bougainville, there was no one left in Japan, who could bring the war to an end.
When and how did we go wrong?
And what did we lose?
We will abandon our past, and create a new Japan with America.
This is our greatest mission for the future!
Okay, that's the editorial!
The answer to that may have to wait 50 or 100 years...
Put this word "Democratize" in the biggest font!
Yes.
But that may also be enough time for the people of our country to forget everything.
IMPERIAL WAR RECORD
But Admiral Yamamoto, that you, who opposed the war above all others, were forced to light its fire...
And that you fought all your battles to restore peace as soon as possible...
These facts, I will always remember.
WAR RECORD OF IMPERIAL JAPAN BY SHINDO
Admiral Yamamoto,
I believe we must start over by really looking at the world.
Following your words, by opening our eyes, our ears and our hearts.
Hello?
Hello?
What the hell is this crap?
- It's Rex.
- What do you need?
A man.
Maximum 20.
Beautiful body.
Not a fattie like the last one.
Hello.
Want a ride?
Irene Huss Ring of Silence
Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Someone dumped the body over there and hurried away.
- What do you say, Jonny?
- Well, glad I'm not 20 years old anymore.
- Was there no such thing back then?
- We stopped when techno and hip hop started.
- Jonny.
- Yes?
See here.
- I must go now.
- Okay.
Bye bye.
- Did you see the invitation to the reception?
- No.
- They are beautiful!
- Ola got them done.
Free.
- Can I go with Mercedes?
- Ola arranged a deal.
- Hello, Dad.
Can I?
- Yes, of course.
Bye bye.
- I need it again tonight.
- You're allowed to borrow the washing machine.
I'm sick of doing on-line job searches and staying in for the plumber.
- Haven't they fixed the drain yet?
- We can't even brush our teeth.
- Will you and Felipe come tonight.
- How much do we get for it?
- Do I have to pay?
- Yes
- Okay. 60 SEK.
- 60 SEK an hour?
Are you teasing?
- Okay, so 100 then.
- 150
- Then you damn well need to come on time.
- Thanks for your help.
- You're welcome.
Jon Rydell, 17 years old would be 18 in two days.
- Difficult age.
- Yes, don't talk about it.
The lab will do an inventory of stomach contents later today.
- Do you suspect drugs?
- That's all young people like.
They will do anything to get a kick.
In my time alcohol was good enough.
- But it wasn't what he died of?
- No.
A blow to the left temple.
Listen here ...
Yes, beaten with a blunt object.
"Branded by lashes on the back, deep cuts across his chest."
"Burn marks from cigarettes and a torn rectum."
- Want to know more?
- No thanks.
I'm going to lunch now.
The victim's parents had no idea.
their son was out partying.
I must go to the Youth Center.
The victim often used their gym.
- Isn't it closed?
- No.
Jenny played music there for several years.
It was always threatened with closure.
- Autopsy report?
- Wait until after lunch.
Whatever he has in his stomach, it isn't Worse than that, you put in yours.
Okay.
Besides a lot of beer there was also feces, urine -
And even gamma hydroxybutyrate.
- GHB?
- Are you ready, Jonny?
Was that a question or an order?
Incidentally.
I have to give you these.
Here you go.
Free bar?
It sounds nice.
Saturday evening ...?
- I was home.
- Same here.
I studied for an exam.
- Not one was in town Saturday night?
- It is important you help us.
Jon was your pal, and now he has been murdered.
- We were in the middle of a pub crawl.
- Where?
- At Avenyn.
- Was Jon there also?
He was drunk and wanted to continue.
- Where to?
- A place with more girls.
I think he tried to call about half past one.
- What do you mean by "believe"?
- The music drowned him out completely.
I let your drunken friend go on alone without knowing where he was going.
- When he asks for help, you drop him?
- No, no.
- How was it?
- I couldn't hear a damn thing.
He could barely speak.
What could I have done?
GHB?
The cursed drug.
Our goal is to get young people away from bad elements and give them other alternatives.
The worst thing about drugs are assault and rape.
There's no easier victim than a stoned teenager.
See here.
MAN WILL TREMBLE
- How often it seems?
- Too often.
A gynecologist comes here every week.
They are examined anonymously here and get the help they need.
- Anonymous?
- We recommend they report it.
We take pictures of their injuries.
But the fear of ending up on the Net -
- And of their friends finding out, is worse for them than the assault.
That's terrible.
Where are the parents?
If your child had been raped, wouldn't you be able to notice it?
They are busy with mortgages, diets, fitness, cards and moss in the lawn.
- Ta-da!
- It was sweet of you.
Thank you.
A latte, so ...
I thought you might need a little ... help.
- Are you sure?
- I can start ...
Jump into the container, so I can continue to sort.
- Container?
- Yes.
Okay.
- Of course.
Do you have something ...
- Here.
Great.
This is Rex.
I don't know what happened.
He just clicked, you know.
He was so damn smug.
Damn smug.
Yes, I know.
But it just happened.
Yes, there it is.
I know I've made a blunder, so ...
I'm fully aware.
it shouldn't happen again.
Good.
Okay, that was all.
Bye.
Hey, kids!
Hello!
Hello!
- Hello.
- God, how poised you are.
They aren't out there in the kitchen.
It is absolute chaos.
Hello, darling.
Welcome.
Hi, Mercedes.
All right?
Katarina, who sits guests over there.
Felipe, move, move.
- Hello.
Ola Stensson.
- My wife Irene.
- Nice to finally meet you.
- Thank you.
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Hopefully, only good.
Or?
Sven Andersson.
Irene's boss.
- It's a nice place.
- Ola leased the premises.
- Which is Olas contribution.
- Your investment is the cooking.
- I am just a little garnish.
- We get on well together.
Or what?
Aren't we good together?
We fit well together.
- Enough.
He's mine.
- Congratulations.
Ola?
Come on.
See you.
- What do we do with this?
- Eat it.
And then you drink the juice.
Cheers.
Argh ... phew
- How's it going?
- Yes, yes, it ...
It was full of maggots.
- Shouldn't we go to the reception instead?
- I must finish here first.
Well, first, we finish here, and then we can go to the reception.
First we need to finish ...
See there.
Bingo.
- Will the ladies have a drink?
- Absolutely.
- Is it okay with mom?
- Yes.
Let me see ...
If you want a fun evening, check out "Vacuum".
- Have you been there?
- No, you have to be 20 years old.
Yes it's true.
But ...
We can do this you go in there and say "hello" from me.
So you don't have to be 20.
Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Cheers.
Here you go, boys.
- We would like to go out now.
- Only a few hours.
Take a taxi home.
- Isn't it fun here?
- Here, there's just old people.
Where?
I can't see any my age.
Can you see any, Sven?
- Bye, bye.
- Bye, darling.
Hello.
Do you have any ID?
Yes yes, Ola.
Welcome.
- I want something sparkling.
- I'll have a beer, please.
This ... is my dream.
I'm ...
I have ...
Did you just see that?
Then you get a new one.
This is my dream.
I've been waiting ages.
Dad, we are going now.
It's starting to get a bit embarrassing.
- Speaking.
- It's not ...
- Mom and I are celebrating that ...
- We'll go soon.
Goodbye, darling.
Felipe, you were fantastic today.
You were great, buddy.
- Shall we go?
- I just feel this is ...
No thank you, thank you.
As the owner you should be there to the bitter end.
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
- And for.
- The very last.
Cheers!
What do you want?
It doesn't matter You just take care of it tonight.
Do you have the energy to walk Sammie?
- I think we emptied half the bar.
- Stop it.
It was a huge success.
And then I was finally allowed to meet Ola Stensson.
He works as ... rar.
How could he leave me in the lurch?
Suddenly I stood there all alone.
- Was Jenny home when you came back?
- Wasn't she home when you came back?
No.
Did she say anything to you about where she went?
No, but you needn't worry.
If there's someone who can look after herself, it's ...
Jenny.
Jenny?
Jenny, darling ...
How are you?
How are you?
I was asleep.
What do you want?
We want to know what happened.
What did you go?
Stop being so annoying.
I'm dead tired.
How much did you have to drink?
Drop it here.
You're not my police.
The jeans belonged to the victim.
Anything new about this?
The keychain doesn't say anything about ...
It says the murderer is a humanist and thinks about others besides himself.
- Do you support the Red Cross?
- Yes, don't you?
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Where the hell were you yesterday?
- Sorry, I ...
- I don't ...
- No.
Where did you go?
I can't remember.
You left me alone in an unpleasant place.
I didn't mean to, I ...
- Did something happen?
- Don't say anything to anyone.
About what?
What happened?
Now, now.
- Sorry, we don't open until nine.
- Hello.
Party, party.
We are investigating the murder of Jon Rydell.
He was here the night he was murdered.
Yes ... right now I'm here, you go.
- We have to ask you something.
- Yes or no.
Jon had GHB in his body.
In addition, he was intoxicated.
- He was under 18
- And?
Are you threatening to cancel our license?
It's like that everywhere.
Fake ID cards and drunk adolescents.
Where's the cloakroom?
Have you tried by the entrance?
- Aha!
- It was good.
What was the number?
65
Here.
It's damn exciting, huh?
What the hell are you doing?
Rumaging through my clothes?
We need to talk.
- It's my room.
You can go now.
- In our house there are our rules.
One of the rules is we talk together.
- Have we talked enough along now?
- Once you've told what I was doing.
We didn't do anything special.
- Then explain it here.
What is it?
- It's Ola from father's restaurant.
Thanks, I know.
I'm talking about what's printed on the back.
Vacuum.
I certainly wasn't there.
How do you explain then, I found this hanging in Vacuum's cloakroom?
- Hello.
Where were you yesterday?
- I just had a little errand.
- You can't just leave me behind.
- I have wildly good news.
One of the guests was the food critic, so I've just ordered.
- What have you ordered?
- We get five stars on the sign.
- Is it for certain?
- I'm just returning from his apartment.
So I feel pretty sure.
But we must talk more about it later.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Is Mercedes at home?
- I'd like to talk to her.
- Yes ...
- Has something serious happened?
- Is she home?
Jenny's mom is here and wants to talk to you.
- Hi, Mercedes.
- Hello.
What happened yesterday?
Jenny didn't say anything.
So, I am here.
You ...
If something happened to you that wasn't right, then say so.
The worst thing you can do is to keep it to yourself.
- What happened?
- I don't know what she is talking about.
What do you really want?
Mercedes, take off your shirt.
Well, sweetheart.
What?
What?
No.
Sweetheart.
So so.
The Youth Center in Goteburg now must be closed -
Because I don't know what time.
Which drugs are the politicians talking about?
Here we influence youth in a positive direction.
Here we engage in the fight against drugs.
- It's Lars Svensson.
- It's Irene Huss, Goteburg Police.
- Do you remember me?
- Absolutely.
How's it going for you?
- Excuse me for calling so late.
- I'm sitting in the car on the way home.
So I could use someone, to keep me awake.
I've thought of your binder.
I want to look closely at it.
I want to compare your photos for similarities with my investigation.
- Then I'll have to break confidentiality.
- Yes, but ...
- I compromise their confidentiality.
- There are many ways to compromise.
- I'm sorry, Irene.
- My daughter's friend was drugged.
She was subjected to same treatment as in your photos.
What do you say?
I didn't know.
I apologize.
If I am to catch the pigs, I need your help.
Just so you know, I am willing to pay double.
There you are, honey.
Cheers and welcome.
- Thank you.
- Cheers.
- Hello!
- Hello.
How I longed for you.
You know what I have done?
Sit down.
A little meatloaf, some potatoes and vegetables.
- Is it good?
- Yes, it's really delicious.
- You were good on television.
- Thanks, honey.
Lars, have you ...
managed to get something?
The film is ...
we can see the movie tonight.
Movie?
What movie?
Isn't succeed ...
Haven't you got anything?
The movie we talked about.
I can't remember the title.
- It would be good.
Shall we see it?
- I don't understand what you say.
You promised me.
You promised!
In my folder.
The inner pocket.
You're an angel.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
- I didn't know you would ...
- I decided early this morning.
- Come in.
- Thank you.
- Go ahead sit down.
- I'll just stand.
For 30 years I've worked to keep youth away from drugs.
The night after you had called, -
I felt all my work was in vain.
Your work has had an enormous importance.
I've lost the war against drugs.
There are more and more drugs.
Whichever way you look at it, I've done something wrong.
So I'm going to let someone else go ahead with it.
Take these.
Good luck.
Review this folder and see if you find something?
- Close it.
Hello.
Close it.
- Oh, sorry.
Hello.
Hello.
I won't disturb you.
We can't contact them.
Then they'd know Lars betrayed their confidence.
Perhaps someone regrets it and wants to talk about it.
Can we ask more generally?
"Is there anyone who has heard anything.
who knows someone who has been ... "
Raped, maybe.
Enjoy your meal.
- Hello, everybody.
How do you like it?
- It's super.
- I must speak with Ola.
- You're not alone.
How's your daughter's friend?
Mercedes?
I will visit her today, so ...
Sorry, I'll be back in a little bit.
- Honey, I'm busy right now.
- Why is Ola really away?
Excellent question.
I only know he isn't here.
Sorry.
He says everything will fix itself.
Here you have the chicken, two times.
He introduced Jenny and Mercedes to Vacuum.
- You don't ...
- No, not until we have spoken with him.
I think we should check Vacuum again.
They were drugged there.
We will be there like flies on the wall when it opens.
- The bartender will recognize us.
- And wonder what we're doing.
- Elin could go there.
- Yes, it was a great idea, buddy.
So the task.
You don't drink.
It's ...
Cool.
- Hi, Mercedes.
- Hello.
- Can I sit down?
- Yes.
I'm working right now on a case where a young man was raped and murdered.
A week ago.
The perpetrator may be the guy who abused you.
Therefore, it is super important you tell everything you know.
I know it's hard.
If you know who it was then you should say.
I don't.
I can't.
Can't we try?
- What is the last thing you remember?
- Nothing.
- I want you to go now.
- It doesn't help either you or me.
- It will only help him.
- I don't know anything.
Now just go.
Go.
- Can you hear me?
- Louder.
- Can you hear me?
- I am inside.
It is completely full.
Okay.
There isn't anything special.
I'll make one more round.
And I think we can go home.
Okay, but take one round more.
Then we'll go home afterwards.
Wait a minute.
It's her, the DJ.
It's the DJ!
- She ran off towards the rear!
- Okay, we'll drive around.
Stop!
Stop!
- Lie still!
- Let me go!
Lie still!
Your small bottle contains enough GHB -
To be classified as possession of a serious drug.
Punishable up to seven years.
I have no idea who they are.
I can't even contact them.
- How do they contact you?
- Via text messages.
- What do they write?
- What they're after.
Girl or boy, large or small breasts and so on.
Tonight they wanted a blonde, thin girl.
We saw the text message on your mobile.
How much you get for your services?
- A thousand a head.
- A thousand SEK?
To destroy someone else's life?
How do you get the money?
And drugs?
The luggage lockers at the bus terminal.
I get the number of the box and the key is located above.
Okay.
- Did I wake you?
- It's okay.
How are you?
It's a shot in the dark, but I'm afraid they have a new victim.
Blond, thin girl.
So I'll call, if she approaches me?
I'll do that.
Thank you.
- Who was that?
- Police.
They are investigating the murder of Jon Rydell, and I'm helping them.
- It's a terrible story.
- Yes.
You ...
I thought if I had to go out a little today.
Just go on a little trip.
- Should I leave the house unlocked?
- Yes.
So I can get some sun.
It would be nice.
Honey, you might well remember what happened last time?
I'll promise to take care of myself.
It took three days, before I found you in Brunnsparken.
It was the worst day of my life.
I love you too much to expose you to it again.
Honey, we've tried everything and you know - the only thing that helps, is for you to stay here.
- There at least we have one camera.
- Yes.
There are several boxes over there.
- Is it the DJ's mobile?
- Yes, she was just sent a text message.
They don't know she was arrested.
"Box number 193"?
He was just here.
Shit!
- We should have blockedd off the entire station.
- It's already too late.
Shit!
- Jontes Lock Service.
- My name is Eva ...
Lisa Svensson.
I have locked myself inside.
We have locks on the windows.
My husband locked up when went out, and I can't find my keys.
What is the address?
69 Lindbergsvägen.
Hurry.
- I gotta find a pen.
- Hurry!
69 Lindbergsvägen ..
There is no more talk time.
The conversation is interrupted.
Shit!
I spoke with the station.
Unfortunately there's no surveillance tape - for the luggage lockers or the arrival hall.
Why not?
The cameras have been out of commission for the last six years.
- They can do all their business there.
- Yes.
It's Maria.
Please leave a message.
Mother, ring, when you hear this.
Call.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Thank you!
Well what happened?
Relax.
What happened?
- Sweetheart ...
- The car out there keeps ...
- It followed me.
- There's no car out there.
This is Rex.
The agreed amount is in #196
I want him as soon as possible.
- Fucking Beautiful.
Want a piece?
- Yes.
I just think I know him there.
Isn't he from the Red Cross?
What's his name?
Something Jarlberg.
- Can you zoom in?
- It can tell you.
Didn't receive some kind of award?
- Gustav Jarlberg.
- Exactly.
Do you think it is ...
I recognized him and remembered the Red Cross keychain.
Can you check the last minute from luggage lockers?
Hey, sorry.
Will you get out of the car.
Yes.
- What is this about?
- What did you put in the luggage locker?
Which luggage locker?
You may well sit down again.
What are you doing?
Do you know who I am?
I know who you are.
It doesn't matter.
- Search the car?
- Yes.
What is it I have an appointment?
- Hello!
- Relax.
I demand an explanation.
I demand an explanation!
- Did you sfind something?
- The spots could be blood.
- And you?
- I can't stay here.
- What do you find?
- Where is the key?
What key?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I'm not saying a word, until my attorney is by my side.
This will cost you dearly.
- I know the police chief.
- You promised not to say a word.
Hello.
- We've apprehended Gustav Jarlberg.
- Elin!
Elin!
Based on the keychain, and because he put something in a luggage locker.
With Irene?
Yes, just a moment.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
- Hi, Sven.
- Have apprehended by Gustav Jarlberg?
Now you hear me!
Let him go!
Okay.
We must let him go.
- There you are seeing.
- Be quiet.
Down with the hand.
There.
I'll get you reassigned, to clean toilets in the jail.
So you must take good care of yourselves.
Close that door.
There.
Thank you.
Elin?
Lock him up again.
It seems I will clean the toilets.
I know who he was.
- Who did this?
- Yes.
How do you know?
You said you didn't see what he looked like.
- No, but I heard his voice.
- So that's how.
You know who he is?
- Are you absolutely sure?
- Yes.
- Then we go to the police.
- No.
- You know who he is.
- I won't.
- You'll have to.
- You not know what the old guy can do to me?
Okay.
What about the stains on the blanket in the backseat?
- He remains silent, until his lawyer arrives.
- When is he coming?
- Yes, when?
- My head will rolls, if that turkey.
- The blood on the handcuffs was Jon's.
- It was nice.
When the lawyer comes he will deny it's his.
If the blood on the handcuffs matches the blood on the carpet -
- It'll be hard to deny.
- You, Sven?
Sven!
- I must get hold of the lawyer.
- His mobile ...?
- Yes.
Thank you.
- Doesn't he use a PIN?
- Apparently not.
- He lives dangerous, that guy.
- Here. "16:07 to 16:09"
- Can you see the number?
- Yes.
Private number.
A secure cash card.
I must do as he says.
I'm scared to death of each text message.
- You can't go around being afraid.
- What should I do?
I don't know.
But you can't go on like this.
If you know who he is, call my mom and tell her.
And what will happen?
I don't know.
But you can call her and hear what she says.
If you still don't want to tell, you don't have to do it.
Okay?
Yes.
Irene Huss, Goteburg Police.
Leave your name, number and message.
- It's just her answering machine.
- Shit.
You have to call again later.
I'm just going to the toilet.
Warning safety alert.
Office door open.
Hello?
Mother, you must come now ...
Shit!
Sorry, but I must take it.
Welcome to voicemail.
You have two new messages.
- It's just the answering machine.
- Shit.
You have to call again later.
Hello?
Mother, you must come now ...
- Honey, why ...
- "Honey"?
Do you really mean it?
Stridner called.
Rydell's blood was in the backseat.
- The lawyer can say what he wants.
- When it pleases him to appear.
Hold the door!
- Hey.
Have you come back?
- I'm so sweet.
- Is Krister here?
- No, he is out on some errands.
There you see.
Work, Work ...
Do you work here all the time now?
No, it's mostly because you haven't been here.
Pis.
- Are you in contact with your phone?
- Oh.
We are fully ready to to track the mobile.
- But ...?
- It's not activated.
As long as it's turned off, He's invisible.
Mercedes?
Hello?
Shh!
Shh.
You!
- I've warned you.
- I haven't said anything.
If I let you go, you'll blab.
I'm not that stupid.
Shit!
It is on!
12 Gustavsgatan?
It's just minutes away by car.
- Now he jumped over.
- He's in a car.
- What do we do now?
- Wait until he stops.
- Gustav Jarlberg got a text message.
- From the secret number?
"Everything is clear.
You get two this time.
Just go over the line."
- Who is it this time?
- You must tell me.
- Where are they?
- Have you seen my lawyer?
Girls?
Boys?
Hello.
Sorry, I'm coming so late.
K.G. Malm, Mr Jarlbergs lawyer.
- Irene Huss.
- Good.
Explain I am completely innocent of their filthy accusations.
- I want to press charges for slander.
- It's not quite that simple.
It's simple.
First I am innocent, and secondly ...
I'm Gustav Jarlberg.
Does it mean nothing?
Gustav, don't worry.
- Do you want be alone a little?
- Yes.
What?
- What then?
- It's stopped.
In a residential neighborhood.
69 Lindbergsvägen
Lars Svensson.
- What are you doing?
!
- No!
- Are you trying to get out?
- I call it trying to escape?
- One word, and I'll kill you.
- Before you had power in your hands.
Don't you think I know what you doing?
Jonny?
We need an ambulance immediately.
Can you hear me?
Yes?
My name is Irene.
I'm from the police.
Are you married to Lars Svensson?
Did he do this to you?
Do you know where he is?
Huh?
- Can you figure out what happened?
- No.
But we'll figure it out.
Look what I found.
Yes, I know.
Just turn it off.
- The wine contains GHB.
- Okay.
Thank you.
- Suicide?
- Do you believe it?
- Lars Svensson?
- Yes, it is quite sick.
- There you go.
- Oh, how lovely.
- Ola showed up today.
- Why did he go?
His mother became acutely ill, so he took Sveg to visit his mother.
Good for you, that he's back.
- Is Jenny home?
- No.
The person you are calling is presently unavailable.
- I've called numerous times.
- Relax, Irene.
- Hello?
- It's Irene, Jenny's mother.
- Is Jenny at Mercedes'?
- No, I thought they were with you.
Okay.
I'll call you later.
- Good.
Hello.
- Wasn't she there?
No.
You have two new messages.
- It's just the answering machine.
- Shit.
You have to call again later.
Hello?
Mother, you must come now ...
- It's Jonny.
- Where did Lars activate his mobile?
- 12 or 14 Gustavsgatan
- Okay, see you there.
Hello.
- How do we know it is here?
- We don't know.
You can't really think Jenny is here.
She is with friends and forgot the time.
It's empty
I'm calling the technicians.
They must take over.
Rex is arrested, and Svensson is out of the picture.
Suicide.
- And the room?
- We'll find a new one.
- What about the goods?
- They are gone.
(camera shutter clicks) You are one hot dog-walker.
Do that again, and I'll kill you.
You love it and you know it.
Seriously, it shows up on Facebook, we're done.
Ooh, so serious.
(dogs barking)
See, even they're annoyed.
Yeah, well, your dog-walking job's cutting into my breakfast time.
Oh, yeah, well, hold on one second.
I just need to get Odie first.
(dog barking)
Odie?
Hey.
Hold this.
Stay.
Hey, boy.
How'd you get out?
Kyle, look.
That's blood.
Maybe he's hurt.
Hey, you okay?
What happened?
(barking)
Come on, let's follow him.
Odie?
Where is he going?
Come here, boy.
(barking)
(barking)
Odie, what is it?
(whimpers)
Kyle, what's he doing?
I don't know.
(whining)
Oh, my God.
Mr. Wooten?
(barking)
♪ NCIS 8x13 ♪ Freedom Original Air Date on February 1, 2011
(elevator bell dings) It's rude, Tony.
I called you four times.
Well, there's two things wrong with that statement.
One, we're not dating, and two, you know I don't take calls from anyone, especially you, after 7:00 p.m.
You forget I have a life.
What's your point?
My point, McGee-Party-of-One, is that you were leaving me messages, evidently, about some kind of case file.
Yeah, one in which I needed you to sign.
Which you could have waited until this morning for.
Give it to me.
See that?
Now all I have to do is sign it.
Look at that.
Signing John Hancock...
just kidding...
Anthony DiNozzo.
I do not like seeing you two fight.
It's not my fault he's sensitive today.
Hmm.
"Mariposa Luxuries."
I didn't order anything.
Maybe somebody else did.
Timmy's got a secret admirer?
Hmm.
Um...
It's real funny, Tony.
(laughing):
You think I did this?
I would not put it past you.
Guys, come on, a little credit, please.
I have grown past this kind of sophomoric thing.
I mean, who would do something so... genius?
McGee with a plastic girlfriend.
Congratulations, Tim.
She's very sweet.
The receipt's got my credit card information on it.
There must be some mistake.
I would cancel your credit card.
Right now all I need to do is figure out how to deflate this thing.
Oh, that's easy.
There's always a button right here on the back of the neck.
There's no reason I should know that.
Morning, boss.
This isn't what it looks like, boss.
Then what is it, Tim?
Um, a joke, I think, a really bad practical joke.
I'm not laughing.
Lose your gal pal.
Grab your gear.
Got a dead marine in Springfield.
This is really awkward.
(plastic squeaking, McGee grunts)
All right.
TONY:
We're looking at Marine Sergeant Travis Wooten, 35 years old, active reservist.
Family?
Married with a six-year-old son.
Wife's a marine...
Gunnery Sergeant Georgia Wooten.
She's 32.
Boss, according to the dog-walker, our victim was home with his wife and child last night.
She spoke to the wife just before 11:00 p.m.
to confirm picking up the dog.
Does she know where they are now?
Nope.
Greetings, everyone.
Oh, isn't this a terrible sight?
GIBBS:
Victim's a marine sergeant, Duck.
Pity about the evergreen.
I doubt that it will survive such a drubbing.
I guess I'm not the only one who kills plants.
Yeah, back in college, my friends used to call me Black Thumb.
They still do, actually, but now it's 'cause I...
I work with dead people.
So not important.
Ah...
There is definite evidence of blunt force trauma.
Some kind of heavy object to the back and sides of the skull.
You got time of death?
Uh... around 1:00 a.m.
He went with a struggle.
There are wounds on the back and front of his hands.
Oh.
Here's something, Doctor.
Looks like part of a twig.
DUCKY:
Yeah.
That could be... any of several species in this garden.
(sighs) Gibbs, I found three plates of food still on the table, and a bathtub full of water.
Wife and child left in a hurry.
Or they were forced to leave.
I also found blood.
Where?
In the master bedroom.
Put out a BOLO.
He might not be our only victim.
Boss, police are canvassing the National Capitol region, but... so far nothing.
- The family contacted?
- Nobody's seen them.
I also talked to
Gunnery Sergeant Wooten's C.O.
He stated she did not request leave or liberty.
GIBBS:
Background?
Well, I guess true love's not dead after all.
Travis and Georgia Wooten, they were high school sweethearts.
They joined the Marines in 2000 and got married two years later.
ZIVA:
Sergeant Wooten served in Afghanistan, stationed at Camp Leatherneck in Helmand Province.
Disciplinary action?
Nothing... his service was without incident.
In more ways than one.
The C.O.s called him
"proficient yet unremarkable."
Maybe that's why he stayed a sergeant and she's a gunny.
Well, apparently, the gunny's a real shooting star.
Georgia Wooten...
She was promoted to gunnery sergeant after only eight years.
Qualified for the Marine Enlisted Commissioning Program.
Did several tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Awarded both the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation and Achievement Medals for exemplary service.
TONY:
That's enough to make any man feel like...
less than a man.
Marriage problems?
Not that we know of.
But the sergeant may have had some problems of his own.
We're still running, uh, credits cards, cell phones, e-mails, but we do know he recently lost his job at a Virginia auto parts plant, and been boozing it up at, uh, Feeney's Billiards ever since.
McGee's got the bank records.
Found multiple charges.
One as recently as last night.
That's an hour before his death.
I'll look for the owner.
(sighs) I love the smell of fresh felt in the morning.
Do not know what that means, and I do not think I want to.
Uh, it's a little Duvall- Apocalypse Now reference, but, never mind, I'm talking about pool tables.
Traditionally, they're green.
For some reason, these are red.
I did not know you were a pool dolphin, Tony?
Pool shark.
And yes, I was.
In fact, I was the champion of my Baltimore precinct in the late '90s.
"Late '90s"?
(laughs) That makes you... sound so...
What, old?
Don't say old.
I didn't say it.
You did.
Well, I bet Renaissance Ray wouldn't even know his way around a pool table.
You know, Tony, you do not wear jealousy very well.
Makes your face look all pinchy.
Pinched.
MAN (laughs):
Oh, I know a bickering couple when I hear one.
Len Feeney, owner and operator.
NCIS Special Agent Tony DiNozzo.
This is Probationary Agent
Ziva David.
And we are not... a couple.
Could've fooled me.
We need to ask you some questions.
Oh, sure.
Here.
It's regarding one of your, um... customers...
Sergeant Travis Wooten.
Sure, I know Travis.
One of my regulars.
Is everything all right?
Not exactly.
He's dead.
Oh.
Well, I just saw him last night.
Did anything happen out of the ordinary?
Well, he came in at his usual time, sat in his usual spot...
Practically his second home, huh?
Well, it is for a lot of service people.
That's the way I want it.
Place to feel comfortable.
I, uh, served in the first Iraq War.
I know the challenges our men and women face when they come home, and Travis was no different.
Challenges were getting to him?
Well, he never let it show.
He was always laughing, cracking jokes ... had a lot of friends around here.
Did any of these friends have issues with Sergeant Wooten?
No, Travis' only issue was his lady.
His lady?
You mean his wife?
Well, as far as I know, he was divorced.
He had a girlfriend, though.
She was a real piece of work.
Loved to make a scene.
Always yelling at him.
And she was here last night.
Clung to him like a wet rag.
Yeah. "Wet rag" have a name?
Oh, yeah, Jancey Gilroy.
Yeah, me and Travis were at the club together.
Until what time?
I don't know;
about 12:30 or so.
Then I went home and went to bed.
You have anyone that can verify that?
I don't understand.
He kissed me good night, and told me he loved me.
Said he'd see me later.
He was fine.
Everything was fine.
Not according to the club owner.
Said you were volatile together.
So what?
You think I had something to do with this?
I loved Travis.
We were going to get married.
Except he already was.
No, you're-you're wrong.
He got a divorce.
I helped him through it.
This is Georgia Wooten, and their six-year-old son, Jacob.
They may be in danger now, too.
I don't know anything about them.
I don't know anything about any of this.
Looks painful.
Yeah, well, you try cutting nails all day long and see what happens.
To think
William Penn was a pacifist.
Was Travis Wooten, Doctor.
Not him;
those.
Gladwynensis Berberis, otherwise known as William Penn barberry.
Penn, of course, was also a devout Quaker.
Penn as in Pennsylvania Penn?
Yes, Mr. Palmer.
Mr. Penn settled that great land... founded a government, and some of his statutes later became the basis of the American Constitution.
"I wrote the Constitution, and all I got was this lousy plant."
(chuckling)
This lousy plant, as you call it, sometimes emits a natural oil that wipes away everything around it.
Lucky break for the killer.
Not so lucky for us.
Ah, Jethro, this, by the way, may take some time.
What I've found so far is troubling.
I counted 11 blows to the head, many more to the back and chest.
Vicious attack.
And determined.
I mean, with that many, the attack must have taken several minutes.
Enough for him to land a few punches himself, Duck?
And get a hand on the weapon.
Mr. Palmer?
The wood taken from Sergeant Wooten's palm was snapped at a downward angle.
In a struggle, a splinter this size could have broken off as the weapon was yanked away.
Did you get prints?
Not yet.
There is another unique marking.
(sighs)
Maybe from a second weapon?
Possibly.
It's a peculiar design.
Abby is working on it.
And then, there are these.
That from the fight?
No.
The wounds are partially scabbed, and the color of the bruises tells me that they're days, if not weeks, old.
You know, Jethro, the nature of this attack suggests someone who's not afraid to get close to their victim, and will stop at nothing to finish him off.
Someone he knew.
Intimately.
TONY:
State police found Gunnery Sergeant Wooten and her son near the Maryland border.
They're bringing them in now.
McGee, contact Family Services.
Request a grief counselor.
Already made the call.
(elevator bell dings)
TONY:
You might want to call them back.
Now.
Hey, sweetie, I need to talk to these people for a moment, so I'm gonna leave you with these two guys, and I'll be right back, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
(sighs)
You must be Agent Gibbs?
Gunny Wooten.
We've got a counselor standing by if you need one.
I don't need a counselor.
I need to see my husband.
I'm asking you to take me to him.
I want to see him for myself.
One heck of a grieving widow.
McGEE:
I'll call Ducky.
(elevator bell dings)
Remove the sheet.
Please?
Take him.
Gunny?
I can't pay for a funeral right now.
Is this going to take long?
I need to get back to my son.
He's in good hands.
I'd rather stand.
Thank you.
(sighs)
You had a lot of people worried.
I promised Jacob we'd go to Kingsland Fun Park for his birthday.
Mm.
What time did you leave?
Just before 11:00.
Fun park open that late?
We wanted to be first in line.
Ah.
Get a hotel room?
Yes.
You tell anybody?
I told my husband.
Told my C.O.
Your C.O. says you didn't request leave or liberty.
He's wrong.
I thought you brought me in here to ask questions about my husband.
Yeah, I did.
Then fire away, Agent Gibbs.
Sergeant Wooten have any enemies?
Besides the ones we're fighting over in Afghanistan?
No.
How about Jancey Gilroy?
His girlfriend?
Travis told me that was over.
Yeah, well, he didn't tell her that.
You having marriage problems?
Well, Travis, uh, lost his job, so... money was tight.
We were... working through it.
We were...
I can't believe he's gone.
I can't believe I get to raise my son alone.
"Get to"?
Hmm?
You "get to"?
My mind's a little scrambled right now.
You look pretty steady to me.
I'm a United States Marine, Agent Gibbs.
Steady is how I'm built.
Steady is what my son needs right now.
Steady... is all I've got.
You're a marine.
You should understand that.
Come on, baby.
(elevator bell dings, doors open)
Get me all the e-mails and phone records on Georgia Wooten.
(elevator bell dings) Now.
Do it.
McGEE:
Okay, well, just so you know, I'm about...
I plan on filing a complaint.
You want to join the party, McGee?
Since when did banks become so evil?
Since about the 12th century.
McGEE:
I'm out almost $10,000.
They say there's nothing they can do.
What happened?
Well, somebody has accessed my accounts, my credit cards;
they even have my social security number.
And they have been racking up payments on just about everything.
Ever Quest online games,
Melissa's Erotic Entertainment.
Hmm.
Oh!
Club Med!
That's new.
My kind of identity thief.
Not a hacker, either.
Uh, how do you know?
My firewall hasn't been penetrated.
Lubricant helps, but everybody has dry spells.
(chuckles)
Can't believe this is happening to me.
What if I have to change my name?
TONY (gasps):
Where do I start?
McGEE:
Oh, no.
Don't.
Please, don't.
McClean,
McFly, McQueen, McGeek,
McBankrupt,
McMiserable,
McRib, McGreek...
ABBY:
Hi, Gibbs!
I've a lot to tell you.
Well, n-not a lot, but enough, for now.
Um, meet Steve, and Bill, and...
Rupert;
at least, that's what I like to call them.
They're replicas of Sergeant Wooten;
specifically, his head.
You know, I thought it might be kind of creepy to name a fake head after a real dead guy, and I thought this would be more respectful.
Abbs, what's the point?
Okay.
I re-created each blow using three different weapons, all made from a material similar in composition to the wood that was found in Sergeant Wooten's hand, and all heavy enough to inflict the same sort of damage.
My goal was to see which one best matched up with the head wounds.
And?
And... it's none of them.
Look...
By measuring the depressions in the skull,
I deduced that the one that came the closest was the broom handle.
But here's the kicker:
it's not close enough.
The markings aren't as deep.
Which makes me think that the weapon is-is smaller, so... voilà !
It's a perfect match.
I know.
So here... is the weapon of choice.
(computer keys clicking)
Nightstick?
Yeah, or something very close to it.
Also, it was... covered in some sort of stain or varnish, or something;
and it's very rare.
I haven't been able to find a single
U.S. manufacturer.
I'm still looking.
What about the neck wound?
Oh...
I'm not sure about that yet, either.
My best guess is some sort of metal chain.
I can't believe the amount of force used.
Our killer had a lot of rage, Abb.
Gibbs, we confirmed Gunnery Sergeant Wooten did, in fact, lie about requesting leave.
C.O. filed the U.A. paperwork today.
McGee, e-mails?
Well, nothing unusual in her Navy correspondence.
Still tracking down all her personal e-mail accounts.
But...
I do have this.
Gunnery Sergeant Wooten has led dozens of
Marine Corps Martial Arts training programs in Quantico.
TONY:
Somebody needs a safe word.
When was this shot?
Two months ago.
After she got back from her last tour in Afghanistan.
A lot of anger there.
She's a strong, powerful woman, in a world dominated by men.
That's not anger:
that is determination.
McGee, zoom in.
McGEE:
Looks like she got banged up.
Poor little rookie never had a chance.
Find out why.
MAN:
Gunnery Sergeant Wooten became overly aggressive with a candidate.
Her conduct was noted and addressed.
That's where the bruises came from?
They were consistent with the incident on that day and prior training sessions, yes.
She get overly aggressive a lot?
No.
First time.
Having any problems with this particular candidate?
Not to my knowledge.
Think the issue went deeper than that.
How deep?
Gunnery Sergeant Wooten is an exceptional marine.
Served as my liaison with Afghan women and children.
Has great focus and skill.
But after her last tour of Afghanistan, that focus has been lacking.
Signs of post-traumatic stress?
Marines are debriefed upon returning from duty.
Physical and psychological evaluations are available to those who need counseling.
McGEE:
The gunnery sergeant need counseling?
Her debriefing showed no need.
You believed that?
I agreed with the evaluations.
Well, I'm not asking for your professional opinion, Major.
Georgia's an incredible woman... great marine and loving mother.
But lately, something's got her all torn up inside, and it has nothing to do with her work here.
ZIVA:
These were taken of Gunnery Sergeant Wooten by an emergency room doctor to document what he called "suspected domestic abuse."
Any other E.R. visits?
ZIVA:
Five in six years.
All different hospitals.
Were the police contacted?
She refused to press charges.
GIBBS:
Was her C.O. notified?
Marine counselors questioned her, but she insisted that her injuries were the result of boxing training at an off-base gym.
She refused the military's help.
Yes.
The only reason she'd lie about that is because Georgia Wooten was an abused woman.
And the guy who was abusing her turns out to be our murder victim?
These bruises and lacerations could be consistent with somebody hitting a target repeatedly.
Target was the wife, Duck.
I wouldn't blame her if she did this.
Nobody would, but that doesn't make it any less of a crime.
She never reported it.
Well, I'm not surprised.
The last thing a woman like Gunnery Sergeant Wooten wants is to be seen as a victim.
No, she's too proud.
Too weak is more like it.
She's a classic case of emotional transference... strong and powerful on the job because she is completely without power at home.
She was a prisoner.
And perhaps killing her husband is her one chance at freedom.
I got to get her to open up.
Yeah, I agree, but I'm not sure that you're the one for the job.
Agent David has been through things that you and I can't even imagine, and she knows what it's like to be controlled.
I'm not sure I want to open up those wounds, Duck.
Yes, but she may be the only one who can connect with her.
GEORGIA:
I told Agent Gibbs all I know.
You did not tell him everything.
I know what happened to you.
You have no right, none at all.
I did not come here to challenge you.
And you think this is helping me?
Look, I'm not the enemy.
I only want to find out the truth.
Truth according to who... you?
JACOB:
Mom,
I'm hungry.
Okay, baby, I'll be in in a second and we'll fix you something.
You need to leave now.
Wait.
I know what it's like to be under the control of a man, to feel like you have no power and the only way to get that power back is to shut down.
You tell yourself you must shut down.
You tell yourself to never show any emotion to anybody.
I know what that's like.
It's the only way you can survive.
I also know what it's like to...
want to seek revenge.
I did not kill my husband, Agent David.
You stay away from me and you stay away from my son.
ZIVA:
There is no getting through to her.
She's closed off.
Even with family and friends, apparently.
I spoke to several of them, and they had no idea the abuse was going on.
Blood from the bedroom matches
Gunnery Sergeant Wooten's, boss.
He beat her one last time and then she snapped.
She claims she was at a hotel that night.
Uh, credit card records show no hotel or motel charges, but it looks like she made more than a few calls, boss.
To who?
One to her husband, one to voice mail, and one to... (typing) him.
Oh.
Well, hello there, Mr. Smooth.
Got calls here dating back several weeks, boss.
Len Feeney told us he didn't even know Georgia Wooten.
(Gibbs laughs)
Imagine that.
He lied.
I didn't tell you 'cause it's none of your business.
Not our business to know you were friends with the dead man's wife?
Look, Georgia called me a few months ago, looking for Travis.
I'd met her once or twice.
You know, she'd pick him up when he was too drunk to drive.
This time her voice was shaking.
Something was wrong.
I told her to stay where she was, be with her boy.
I'd calm Travis down before he went home.
So you knew about the abuse?
We'd talk, I'd check in with her.
I mean, I would have reported it myself, but she told me not to.
Said it would just make things worse.
But maybe she had other plans.
She ever talk about wanting her husband dead?
Oh, no.
Said she would never kill the father of her child, and honestly
I didn't understand it.
Somebody as strong as her?
Well, I believe Gunnery Sergeant Wooten was too afraid to confront him.
(chuckles)
His girlfriend sure wasn't.
Jancey Gilroy?
Mm-hmm.
Travis Wooten attacked her, too?
More like she attacked him.
Happened that night.
Got so bad I almost had to call the cops.
Thanks, Jen.
All right, boss, we got a history of drug and alcohol abuse.
Girl's in and out of rehab.
Got a criminal record?
(chuckles) And does she.
DUI, possession, assault.
She got kicked out of high school for putting another girl in the hospital.
A real Girl Gone Wild kind of girl..
ZIVA:
We'll check it out.
(hangs up phone)
Gibbs, Ducky found a small chip of fingernail polish embedded deep in Travis Wooten's arm.
Traced it to Ms. Gilroy's beauty salon.
McGee, got a location?
Boss, she hasn't shown up for work in two days, and her bank just confirmed she cashed out all her accounts this morning.
You got someone looking for the car?
State police.
Find her.
(engine accelerating, tires screeching)
(car doors open)
Let me see your hands.
Going somewhere, Ms. Gilroy?
(handcuffs clicking)
I didn't kill Travis.
I loved him.
Love do that?
We were passionate.
Sometimes we got physical.
So what?
A lot of couples do.
It's no big deal.
It is if one of them ends up dead.
So what happened?
Find out he was married?
You snap?
No.
ZIVA:
If the sergeant was married, what do you think that makes you?
We had something special, all right?
He tell you that?
N...
I-I just knew.
Or maybe it is what you wanted to believe.
I thought Travis was different than the other guys.
I thought he really wanted to be with me.
He used you.
He threw me away like a piece of trash.
I got things to offer.
I'm not trash, you know.
Made you angry.
I wanted to hurt him like he hurt me, make him suffer.
So you finished the job?
I'm pregnant.
As mad as I was, I would never kill him.
Sergeant Wooten know that?
I told him that night.
And that is why you fought?
He lost it.
Started telling me he already had a wife and a kid and calling me all kinds of names.
I ran out of the club, I got a cab, and I never looked back.
Well, a D.C. cab service confirms Gilroy took one of their cabs that night.
I don't know whether it was before or after the murder.
Still in communications with them.
I need times.
ABBY:
I've got a time for you, Gibbs.
Well, not a time but something that keeps time... although I've never really understood that expression because it's not like you can get it back... you know, time, I mean.
Abby.
Um, okay, so you know that little weird mark that was on the back of Sergeant Wooten's neck?
Not from a chain at all.
A watch band?
A vintage Belle and Sloane 1959 special edition
14-karat gold- plated watch band, to be exact.
There was only 700 sold in the United States, and our killer is wearing one.
Well, then Jancey Gilroy is not our killer.
Cab service just sent over footage from inside the taxi.
Look at this.
Meter begins at 12:37 a.m.
at Feeney's Billiard Club... note no watch...
and the ride ends at 12:55 at 6301 Kentwood Circle.
That's Gilroy's address... 20 miles from Travis Wooten's home.
What now, boss?
(phone rings)
McGee.
GIBBS:
McGee, I'm in autopsy.
Put up Georgia Wooten's training video.
Right, on it.
(typing)
Fast-forward.
Stop it.
There, zoom in.
Well, it looks like Gunnery Sergeant Wooten fought back after all.
Yeah, and this time she killed.
Nice and tight.
Tuck the chin, drive it through.
Okay.
Gunny, tell your people to stand by.
Sergeant, you've got it?
Corporal McNeil, front and center.
You need to come with us.
I don't understand.
Do not make this more difficult for yourself.
(Sergeant speaking indistinctly)
No handcuffs, please, not in front of them.
You're in pain.
You don't know anything about me.
I know more than you think.
July 27, 2005.
Admitted to Bethlehem Emergency for a fractured jaw.
September 4, 2008.
Different hospital.
Lacerations to the legs and arms.
March 17, 2010.
Bruised rib, broken clavicle.
Enough.
I am not a victim.
No.
No, you're not.
You're a survivor.
(sighs, sniffing)
You know, I, uh...
I could take the beatings.
I mean, they'd happened for so long,
I didn't even feel the pain anymore.
(sniffles)
Even when he, uh... when he made sure to hit me in places that... no one would see.
But Travis knew
I was getting numb... (sniffles) so, he started looking for new ways to hurt me.
You know, to control me.
He was looking for my breaking point.
(sniffles)
That night, he found it.
(sniffles)
He found the... the one thing that could make me... break.
(softly):
Your child.
(sniffles)
He...
He threatened to take Jacob.
(crying)
You know, he'd tell the courts that I was unfit, that I been written up for fighting on the job, that I was away on duty more than I was home.
He said, by the time he was done,
I would never see Jacob again.
You can hurt me all you want, but you don't touch my child.
I'd die for him.
Would you kill?
I grabbed Jacob, and I ran.
I mean, I'd run before.
I just always came back, but this time...
I knew we had to disappear.
I knew how to run from my husband.
I didn't know how to kill him.
It wasn't me, Agent Gibbs.
Tony, this is huge.
You realize the FBI says that I might be involved in this Russian identity theft ring?
Calm down, McSpiracy.
Before you go all global, let's take a look at this list of charges again.
Come on.
I don't have time for this.
Back in my Baltimore Homicide days,
I'd do 20 of these a week.
You never did cyber crime.
No, but I did take a Saturday seminar once, and I excelled.
Hit me.
Hmm.
Meltdown Comics,
Lola's Pleasure Chest, GameStop and Relax the Back.
I've got it.
Your identity thief is a 14-year-old pimpled-faced comic book fanatic with severe osteoporosis.
Thank you so much for your help, Tony.
You know I'm here for you.
Talk to me, Abbs.
Oh, I'm not the one who's talking, Gibbs.
That is.
And it happens to have a really thick Irish brogue.
Sorry.
You lost me.
Okay, you remember the varnish chips that I could not trace?
Well, there was a reason for that.
And it comes all the way from the rolling hills of... wait for it, wait for it...
County Donegal, Ireland.
The company's called McClendon's Fine Finishes.
They specialize in high-end varnishes that are used for one thing and one thing only.
You want to guess what that is?
Okay.
I'll show you.
(keyboard keys clacking)
Break a pool cue in half, and you've got one killer weapon.
So to speak.
You need to start calling first, Agent DiNozzo.
I'm in a meeting.
It can wait.
Excuse us?
Well, at least let me offer you a drink first.
Just got a nice imported single malt in, hmm?
That's not the only thing you've got imported.
It's a 1999 Scarpello limited edition.
African blackwood.
Made a chess set out of this once.
It's incredibly dense.
Top of the line.
Like things how I like 'em.
People ever mess with the things you like, Mr. Feeney?
Oh, they're wise not to.
So, uh, Sergeant Wooten... guess he wasn't too wise, huh?
(laughs)
That's insane.
You think I'd risk all of this for Wooten?
No, not for him, but I think you would for his wife.
Georgia.
Hearing your voice that night, how scared you were, I...
I had to confront Travis.
I-I had to stop him.
He came at me, and once I hit him, I couldn't stop.
I kept pounding and pounding on him over and over again until I couldn't anymore.
I'd do anything for you.
Take me home.
Please?
(handcuffs clicking)
Tell me, you wouldn't have done the same thing?
TONY:
So you haven't seen The Hunt for Red October?
BOY:
Nope.
Yeah, it's when Alec Baldwin was skinny.
This your new best friend, Tony?
Oh, he's not here to see me.
Tim McGee?
Meet Tim McGee.
'Sup, dude?
Hello.
I don't get it.
Well, Tim, there are two kinds of identity thieves.
There's the kind you never know, and there's the kind that knows you so well, that they're aware you're not home from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.
You're Mrs. Miller's kid, right?
Nick?
Who is Mrs. Miller?
It's McGee's landlady, the holder of the keys.
Oh.
She also has a bad back.
(squeaks)
It was you?
!
You stole my identity?
You sent me an inflatable girlfriend?
You know, I'm out almost ten grand.
Dude, it's fraud, and you're only liable for, like, 50 bucks.
Yeah, dude.
Why?
Why did you do this to me?
You're always doing the same thing.
Go to work, come home, go to work again.
You even order the same take-out food every single night.
Not every night.
Dude, yes.
You got to start living.
You're too young to act so old.
(Tony laughs)
You're welcome.
(sighs) Can we go to GameStop now?
TONY:
Yeah, man.
My little dude.
You want to come?
Tony, I got all this paperwork.
I got to...
(Tony clears his throat)
All right, you know what?
Let's go.
I'd love to.
Excellent.
Smokin' hot chick.
Can she come, too?
Cool it, Nick.
(laughs)
You know you're still gonna owe me that 50 bucks.
Talk to my mom, bro.
You are one hot dog-walker.
Do that again, and I'll kill you.
You love it and you know it.
Seriously, it shows up on Facebook, we're done.
Ooh, so serious.
See, even they're annoyed.
Yeah, well, your dog-walking job's cutting into my breakfast time.
Oh, yeah, well, hold on one second.
I just need to get Odie first.
Odie?
Hey.
Hold this.
Stay.
Hey, boy.
How'd you get out?
Kyle, look.
That's blood.
Maybe he's hurt.
Hey, you okay?
What happened?
Come on, let's follow him.
Odie?
Where is he going?
Come here, boy.
Odie, what is it?
Kyle, what's he doing?
I don't know.
Oh, my God.
Mr. Wooten?
d NCIS 8x13 d Freedom Original Air Date on February 1, 2011
It's rude, Tony.
I called you four times.
Well, there's two things wrong with that statement.
One, we're not dating, and two, you know I don't take calls from anyone, especially you, after 7:00 p.m.
You forget I have a life.
What's your point?
My point, McGee-Party-of-One, is that you were leaving me messages, evidently, about some kind of case file.
Yeah, one in which I needed you to sign.
Which you could have waited until this morning for.
Give it to me.
See that?
Now all I have to do is sign it.
Look at that.
Signing John Hancock-- just kidding--
Anthony DiNozzo.
I do not like seeing you two fight.
It's not my fault he's sensitive today.
Hmm.
"Mariposa Luxuries."
I didn't order anything.
Maybe somebody else did.
Timmy's got a secret admirer?
Hmm.
Um...
It's real funny, Tony.
You think I did this?
I would not put it past you.
Guys, come on, a little credit, please.
I have grown past this kind of sophomoric thing.
I mean, who would do something so... genius?
McGee with a plastic girlfriend.
Congratulations, Tim.
She's very sweet.
The receipt's got my credit card information on it.
There must be some mistake.
I would cancel your credit card.
Right now all I need to do is figure out how to deflate this thing.
Oh, that's easy.
There's always a button right here on the back of the neck.
There's no reason I should know that.
Morning, boss.
This isn't what it looks like, boss.
Then what is it, Tim?
Um, a joke, I think, a really bad practical joke.
I'm not laughing.
Lose your gal pal.
Grab your gear.
Got a dead marine in Springfield.
This is really awkward.
All right.
We're looking at Marine Sergeant Travis Wooten, 35 years old, active reservist.
Family?
Married with a six-year-old son.
Wife's a marine-
- Gunnery Sergeant Georgia Wooten.
She's 32.
Boss, according to the dog-walker, our victim was home with his wife and child last night.
She spoke to the wife just before 11:00 p.m.
to confirm picking up the dog.
Does she know where they are now?
Nope.
Greetings, everyone.
Oh, isn't this a terrible sight?
Victim's a marine sergeant, Duck.
Pity about the evergreen.
I doubt that it will survive such a drubbing.
I guess I'm not the only one who kills plants.
Yeah, back in college, my friends used to call me Black Thumb.
They still do, actually, but now it's 'cause I...
I work with dead people.
So not important.
Ah...
There is definite evidence of blunt force trauma.
Some kind of heavy object to the back and sides of the skull.
You got time of death?
Uh... around 1:00 a.m.
He went with a struggle.
There are wounds on the back and front of his hands.
Oh.
Here's something, Doctor.
Looks like part of a twig.
Yeah.
That could be... any of several species in this garden.
Gibbs, I found three plates of food still on the table, and a bathtub full of water.
Wife and child left in a hurry.
Or they were forced to leave.
I also found blood.
Where?
In the master bedroom.
Put out a BOLO.
He might not be our only victim.
Boss, police are canvassing the National Capitol region, but... so far nothing.
- The family contacted?
- Nobody's seen them.
I also talked to
Gunnery Sergeant Wooten's C.O.
He stated she did not request leave or liberty.
Background?
Well, I guess true love's not dead after all.
Travis and Georgia Wooten, they were high school sweethearts.
They joined the Marines in 2000 and got married two years later.
Sergeant Wooten served in Afghanistan, stationed at Camp Leatherneck in Helmand Province.
Disciplinary action?
Nothing-- his service was without incident.
In more ways than one.
The C.O.s called him
"proficient yet unremarkable."
Maybe that's why he stayed a sergeant and she's a gunny.
Well, apparently, the gunny's a real shooting star.
Georgia Wooten...
She was promoted to gunnery sergeant after only eight years.
Qualified for the Marine Enlisted Commissioning Program.
Did several tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Awarded both the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation and Achievement Medals for exemplary service.
That's enough to make any man feel like...
less than a man.
Marriage problems?
Not that we know of.
But the sergeant may have had some problems of his own.
We're still running, uh, credits cards, cell phones, e-mails, but we do know he recently lost his job at a Virginia auto parts plant, and been boozing it up at, uh, Feeney's Billiards ever since.
McGee's got the bank records.
Found multiple charges.
One as recently as last night.
That's an hour before his death.
I'll look for the owner.
I love the smell of fresh felt in the morning.
Do not know what that means, and I do not think I want to.
Uh, it's a little Duvall- Apocalypse Now reference, but, never mind, I'm talking about pool tables.
Traditionally, they're green.
For some reason, these are red.
I did not know you were a pool dolphin, Tony?
Pool shark.
And yes, I was.
In fact, I was the champion of my Baltimore precinct in the late '90s.
"Late '90s"?
That makes you... sound so...
What, old?
Don't say old.
I didn't say it.
You did.
Well, I bet Renaissance Ray wouldn't even know his way around a pool table.
You know, Tony, you do not wear jealousy very well.
Makes your face look all pinchy.
Pinched.
MAN Oh, I know a bickering couple when I hear one.
Len Feeney, owner and operator.
NCIS Special Agent Tony DiNozzo.
This is Probationary Agent
Ziva David.
And we are not... a couple.
Could've fooled me.
We need to ask you some questions.
Oh, sure.
Here.
It's regarding one of your, um... customers...
Sergeant Travis Wooten.
Sure, I know Travis.
One of my regulars.
Is everything all right?
Not exactly.
He's dead.
Oh.
Well, I just saw him last night.
Did anything happen out of the ordinary?
Well, he came in at his usual time, sat in his usual spot...
Practically his second home, huh?
Well, it is for a lot of service people.
That's the way I want it.
Place to feel comfortable.
I, uh, served in the first Iraq War.
I know the challenges our men and women face when they come home, and Travis was no different.
Challenges were getting to him?
Well, he never let it show.
He was always laughing, cracking jokes ... had a lot of friends around here.
Did any of these friends have issues with Sergeant Wooten?
No, Travis' only issue was his lady.
His lady?
You mean his wife?
Well, as far as I know, he was divorced.
He had a girlfriend, though.
She was a real piece of work.
Loved to make a scene.
Always yelling at him.
And she was here last night.
Clung to him like a wet rag.
Yeah. "Wet rag" have a name?
Oh, yeah, Jancey Gilroy.
Yeah, me and Travis were at the club together.
Until what time?
I don't know;
about 12:30 or so.
Then I went home and went to bed.
You have anyone that can verify that?
I don't understand.
He kissed me good night, and told me he loved me.
Said he'd see me later.
He was fine.
Everything was fine.
Not according to the club owner.
Said you were volatile together.
So what?
You think I had something to do with this?
I loved Travis.
We were going to get married.
Except he already was.
No, you're-you're wrong.
He got a divorce.
I helped him through it.
This is Georgia Wooten, and their six-year-old son, Jacob.
They may be in danger now, too.
I don't know anything about them.
I don't know anything about any of this.
Looks painful.
Yeah, well, you try cutting nails all day long and see what happens.
To think
William Penn was a pacifist.
was Travis Wooten, Doctor.
Not him;
those.
Gladwynensis Berberis, otherwise known as William Penn barberry.
Penn, of course, was also a devout Quaker.
Penn as in Pennsylvania Penn?
Yes, Mr. Palmer.
Mr. Penn settled that great land... founded a government, and some of his statutes later became the basis of the American Constitution.
"I wrote the Constitution, and all I got was this lousy plant."
This lousy plant, as you call it, sometimes emits a natural oil that wipes away everything around it.
Lucky break for the killer.
Not so lucky for us.
Ah, Jethro, this, by the way, may take some time.
What I've found so far is troubling.
I counted 11 blows to the head, many more to the back and chest.
Vicious attack.
And determined.
I mean, with that many, the attack must have taken several minutes.
Enough for him to land a few punches himself, Duck?
And get a hand on the weapon.
Mr. Palmer?
The wood taken from Sergeant Wooten's palm was snapped at a downward angle.
In a struggle, a splinter this size could have broken off as the weapon was yanked away.
Did you get prints?
Not yet.
There is another unique marking.
Maybe from a second weapon?
Possibly.
It's a peculiar design.
Abby is working on it.
And then, there are these.
That from the fight?
No.
The wounds are partially scabbed, and the color of the bruises tells me that they're days, if not weeks, old.
You know, Jethro, the nature of this attack suggests someone who's not afraid to get close to their victim, and will stop at nothing to finish him off.
Someone he knew.
Intimately.
State police found Gunnery Sergeant Wooten and her son near the Maryland border.
They're bringing them in now.
McGee, contact Family Services.
Request a grief counselor.
Already made the call.
You might want to call them back.
Now.
Hey, sweetie, I need to talk to these people for a moment, so I'm gonna leave you with these two guys, and I'll be right back, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
You must be Agent Gibbs?
Gunny Wooten.
We've got a counselor standing by if you need one.
I don't need a counselor.
I need to see my husband.
I'm asking you to take me to him.
I want to see him for myself.
One heck of a grieving widow.
I'll call Ducky.
Remove the sheet.
Please?
Take him.
Gunny?
I can't pay for a funeral right now.
Is this going to take long?
I need to get back to my son.
He's in good hands.
I'd rather stand.
Thank you.
You had a lot of people worried.
I promised Jacob we'd go to Kingsland Fun Park for his birthday.
Mm.
What time did you leave?
Just before 11:00.
Fun park open that late?
We wanted to be first in line.
Ah.
Get a hotel room?
Yes.
You tell anybody?
I told my husband.
Told my C.O.
Your C.O. says you didn't request leave or liberty.
He's wrong.
I thought you brought me in here to ask questions about my husband.
Yeah, I did.
Then fire away, Agent Gibbs.
Sergeant Wooten have any enemies?
Besides the ones we're fighting over in Afghanistan?
No.
How about Jancey Gilroy?
His girlfriend?
Travis told me that was over.
Yeah, well, he didn't tell her that.
You having marriage problems?
Well, Travis, uh, lost his job, so... money was tight.
We were... working through it.
We were...
I can't believe he's gone.
I can't believe I get to raise my son alone.
"Get to"?
Hmm?
You "get to"?
My mind's a little scrambled right now.
You look pretty steady to me.
I'm a United States Marine, Agent Gibbs.
Steady is how I'm built.
Steady is what my son needs right now.
Steady... is all I've got.
You're a marine.
You should understand that.
Come on, baby.
Get me all the e-mails and phone records on Georgia Wooten.
Now.
Do it.
Okay, well, just so you know, I'm about...
I plan on filing a complaint.
You want to join the party, McGee?
Since when did banks become so evil?
Since about the 12th century.
I'm out almost $10,000.
They say there's nothing they can do.
What happened?
Well, somebody has accessed my accounts, my credit cards;
they even have my social security number.
And they have been racking up payments on just about everything.
EverQuest online games,
Melissa's Erotic Entertainment.
Hmm.
Oh!
Club Med!
That's new.
My kind of identity thief.
Not a hacker, either.
Uh, how do you know?
My firewall hasn't been penetrated.
Lubricant helps, but everybody has dry spells.
Can't believe this is happening to me.
What if I have to change my name?
TONY Where do I start?
Oh, no.
Don't.
Please, don't.
McClean,
McFly, McQueen, McGeek,
McBankrupt,
McMiserable,
McRib, McGreek...
Hi, Gibbs!
I've a lot to tell you.
Well, n-not a lot, but enough, for now.
Um, meet Steve, and Bill, and...
Rupert;
at least, that's what I like to call them.
They're replicas of Sergeant Wooten;
specifically, his head.
You know, I thought it might be kind of creepy to name a fake head after a real dead guy, and I thought this would be more respectful.
Abbs, what's the point?
Okay.
I re-created each blow using three different weapons, all made from a material similar in composition to the wood that was found in Sergeant Wooten's hand, and all heavy enough to inflict the same sort of damage.
My goal was to see which one best matched up with the head wounds.
And?
And... it's none of them.
Look...
By measuring the depressions in the skull,
I deduced that the one that came the closest was the broom handle.
But here's the kicker:
it's not close enough.
The markings aren't as deep.
Which makes me think that the weapon is-is smaller, so... voila!
It's a perfect match.
I know.
So here... is the weapon of choice.
Nightstick?
Yeah, or something very close to it.
Also, it was... covered in some sort of stain or varnish, or something;
and it's very rare.
I haven't been able to find a single
U.S. manufacturer.
I'm still looking.
What about the neck wound?
Oh...
I'm not sure about that yet, either.
My best guess is some sort of metal chain.
I can't believe the amount of force used.
Our killer had a lot of rage, Abb.
Gibbs, we confirmed Gunnery Sergeant Wooten did, in fact, lie about requesting leave.
C.O. filed the U.A. paperwork today.
McGee, e-mails?
Well, nothing unusual in her Navy correspondence.
Still tracking down all her personal e-mail accounts.
But...
I do have this.
Gunnery Sergeant Wooten has led dozens of
Marine Corps Martial Arts training programs in Quantico.
Somebody needs a safe word.
When was this shot?
Two months ago.
After she got back from her last tour in Afghanistan.
A lot of anger there.
She's a strong, powerful woman, in a world dominated by men.
That's not anger:
that is determination.
McGee, zoom in.
Looks like she got banged up.
Poor little rookie never had a chance.
Find out why.
Gunnery Sergeant Wooten became overly aggressive with a candidate.
Her conduct was noted and addressed.
That's where the bruises came from?
They were consistent with the incident on that day and prior training sessions, yes.
She get overly aggressive a lot?
No.
First time.
Having any problems with this particular candidate?
Not to my knowledge.
Think the issue went deeper than that.
How deep?
Gunnery Sergeant Wooten is an exceptional marine.
Served as my liaison with Afghan women and children.
Has great focus and skill.
But after her last tour of Afghanistan, that focus has been lacking.
Signs of post-traumatic stress?
Marines are debriefed upon returning from duty.
Physical and psychological evaluations are available to those who need counseling.
The gunnery sergeant need counseling?
Her debriefing showed no need.
You believed that?
I agreed with the evaluations.
Well, I'm not asking for your professional opinion, Major.
Georgia's an incredible woman... great marine and loving mother.
But lately, something's got her all torn up inside, and it has nothing to do with her work here.
These were taken of Gunnery Sergeant Wooten by an emergency room doctor to document what he called "suspected domestic abuse."
Any other E.R. visits?
Five in six years.
All different hospitals.
Were the police contacted?
She refused to press charges.
Was her C.O. notified?
Marine counselors questioned her, but she insisted that her injuries were the result of boxing training at an off-base gym.
She refused the military's help.
Yes.
The only reason she'd lie about that is because Georgia Wooten was an abused woman.
And the guy who was abusing her turns out to be our murder victim?
These bruises and lacerations could be consistent with somebody hitting a target repeatedly.
Target was the wife, Duck.
I wouldn't blame her if she did this.
Nobody would, but that doesn't make it any less of a crime.
She never reported it.
Well, I'm not surprised.
The last thing a woman like Gunnery Sergeant Wooten wants is to be seen as a victim.
No, she's too proud.
Too weak is more like it.
She's a classic case of emotional transference-- strong and powerful on the job because she is completely without power at home.
She was a prisoner.
And perhaps killing her husband is her one chance at freedom.
I got to get her to open up.
Yeah, I agree, but I'm not sure that you're the one for the job.
Agent David has been through things that you and I can't even imagine, and she knows what it's like to be controlled.
I'm not sure I want to open up those wounds, Duck.
Yes, but she may be the only one who can connect with her.
I told Agent Gibbs all I know.
You did not tell him everything.
I know what happened to you.
You have no right, none at all.
I did not come here to challenge you.
And you think this is helping me?
Look, I'm not the enemy.
I only want to find out the truth.
Truth according to who-- you?
Mom,
I'm hungry.
Okay, baby, I'll be in in a second and we'll fix you something.
You need to leave now.
Wait.
I know what it's like to be under the control of a man, to feel like you have no power and the only way to get that power back is to shut down.
You tell yourself you must shut down.
You tell yourself to never show any emotion to anybody.
I know what that's like.
It's the only way you can survive.
I also know what it's like to...
want to seek revenge.
I did not kill my husband, Agent David.
You stay away from me and you stay away from my son.
There is no getting through to her.
She's closed off.
Even with family and friends, apparently.
I spoke to several of them, and they had no idea the abuse was going on.
Blood from the bedroom matches
Gunnery Sergeant Wooten's, boss.
He beat her one last time and then she snapped.
She claims she was at a hotel that night.
Uh, credit card records show no hotel or motel charges, but it looks like she made more than a few calls, boss.
To who?
One to her husband, one to voice mail, and one to him.
Oh.
Well, hello there, Mr. Smooth.
Got calls here dating back several weeks, boss.
Len Feeney told us he didn't even know Georgia Wooten.
Imagine that.
He lied.
I didn't tell you 'cause it's none of your business.
Not our business to know you were friends with the dead man's wife?
Look, Georgia called me a few months ago, looking for Travis.
I'd met her once or twice.
You know, she'd pick him up when he was too drunk to drive.
This time her voice was shaking.
Something was wrong.
I told her to stay where she was, be with her boy.
I'd calm Travis down before he went home.
So you knew about the abuse?
We'd talk, I'd check in with her.
I mean, I would have reported it myself, but she told me not to.
Said it would just make things worse.
But maybe she had other plans.
She ever talk about wanting her husband dead?
Oh, no.
Said she would never kill the father of her child, and honestly
I didn't understand it.
Somebody as strong as her?
Well, I believe Gunnery Sergeant Wooten was too afraid to confront him.
His girlfriend sure wasn't.
Jancey Gilroy?
Mm-hmm.
Travis Wooten attacked her, too?
More like she attacked him.
Happened that night.
Got so bad I almost had to call the cops.
Thanks, Jen.
All right, boss, we got a history of drug and alcohol abuse.
Girl's in and out of rehab.
Got a criminal record?
And does she.
DUI, possession, assault.
She got kicked out of high school for putting another girl in the hospital.
A real Girl Gone Wild kind of girl..
We'll check it out.
Gibbs, Ducky found a small chip of fingernail polish embedded deep in Travis Wooten's arm.
Traced it to Ms. Gilroy's beauty salon.
McGee, got a location?
Boss, she hasn't shown up for work in two days, and her bank just confirmed she cashed out all her accounts this morning.
You got someone looking for the car?
State police.
Find her.
Let me see your hands.
Going somewhere, Ms. Gilroy?
I didn't kill Travis.
I loved him.
Love do that?
We were passionate.
Sometimes we got physical.
So what?
A lot of couples do.
It's no big deal.
It is if one of them ends up dead.
So what happened?
Find out he was married?
You snap?
No.
If the sergeant was married, what do you think that makes you?
We had something special, all right?
He tell you that?
N...
I-I just knew.
Or maybe it is what you wanted to believe.
I thought Travis was different than the other guys.
I thought he really wanted to be with me.
He used you.
He threw me away like a piece of trash.
I got things to offer.
I'm not trash, you know.
Made you angry.
I wanted to hurt him like he hurt me, make him suffer.
So you finished the job?
I'm pregnant.
As mad as I was, I would never kill him.
Sergeant Wooten know that?
I told him that night.
And that is why you fought?
He lost it.
Started telling me he already had a wife and a kid and calling me all kinds of names.
I ran out of the club, I got a cab, and I never looked back.
Well, a D.C. cab service confirms Gilroy took one of their cabs that night.
I don't know whether it was before or after the murder.
Still in communications with them.
I need times.
I've got a time for you, Gibbs.
Well, not a time but something that keeps time-- although I've never really understood that expression because it's not like you can get it back-- you know, time, I mean.
Abby.
Um, okay, so you know that little weird mark that was on the back of Sergeant Wooten's neck?
Not from a chain at all.
A watch band?
A vintage Belle and Sloane 1959 special edition
14-karat gold- plated watch band, to be exact.
There was only 700 sold in the United States, and our killer is wearing one.
Well, then Jancey Gilroy is not our killer.
Cab service just sent over footage from inside the taxi.
Look at this.
Meter begins at 12:37 a.m.
at Feeney's Billiard Club-- note no watch-- and the ride ends at 12:55 at 6301 Kentwood Circle.
That's Gilroy's address-- 20 miles from Travis Wooten's home.
What now, boss?
McGee.
McGee, I'm in autopsy.
Put up Georgia Wooten's training video.
Right, on it.
Fast-forward.
Stop it.
There, zoom in.
Well, it looks like Gunnery Sergeant Wooten fought back after all.
Yeah, and this time she killed.
Nice and tight.
Tuck the chin, drive it through.
Okay.
Gunny, tell your people to stand by.
Sergeant, you've got it?
Corporal McNeil, front and center.
You need to come with us.
I don't understand.
Do not make this more difficult for yourself.
No handcuffs, please, not in front of them.
You're in pain.
You don't know anything about me.
I know more than you think.
July 27, 2005.
Admitted to Bethlehem Emergency for a fractured jaw.
September 4, 2008.
Different hospital.
Lacerations to the legs and arms.
March 17, 2010.
Bruised rib, broken clavicle.
Enough.
I am not a victim.
No.
No, you're not.
You're a survivor.
You know, I, uh...
I could take the beatings.
I mean, they'd happened for so long,
I didn't even feel the pain anymore.
Even when he, uh when he made sure to hit me in places that... no one would see.
But Travis knew
I was getting numb so, he started looking for new ways to hurt me.
You know, to control me.
He was looking for my breaking point.
That night, he found it.
He found the... the one thing that could make me... break.
Your child.
He...
He threatened to take Jacob.
You know, he'd tell the courts that I was unfit, that I been written up for fighting on the job, that I was away on duty more than I was home.
He said, by the time he was done,
I would never see Jacob again.
You can hurt me all you want, but you don't touch my child.
I'd die for him.
Would you kill?
I grabbed Jacob, and I ran.
I mean, I'd run before.
I just always came back, but this time...
I knew we had to disappear.
I knew how to run from my husband.
I didn't know how to kill him.
It wasn't me, Agent Gibbs.
Tony, this is huge.
You realize the FBI says that I might be involved in this Russian identity theft ring?
Calm down, McSpiracy.
Before you go all global, let's take a look at this list of charges again.
Come on.
I don't have time for this.
Back in my Baltimore Homicide days,
I'd do 20 of these a week.
You never did cyber crime.
No, but I did take a Saturday seminar once, and I excelled.
Hit me.
Hmm.
Meltdown Comics,
Lola's Pleasure Chest, GameStop and Relax the Back.
I've got it.
Your identity thief is a 14-year-old pimpled-faced comic book fanatic with severe osteoporosis.
Thank you so much for your help, Tony.
You know I'm here for you.
Talk to me, Abbs.
Oh, I'm not the one who's talking, Gibbs.
That is.
And it happens to have a really thick Irish brogue.
Sorry.
You lost me.
Okay, you remember the varnish chips that I could not trace?
Well, there was a reason for that.
And it comes all the way from the rolling hills of-- wait for it, wait for it County Donegal, Ireland.
The company's called McClendon's Fine Finishes.
They specialize in high-end varnishes that are used for one thing and one thing only.
You want to guess what that is?
Okay.
I'll show you.
Break a pool cue in half, and you've got one killer weapon.
So to speak.
You need to start calling first, Agent DiNozzo.
I'm in a meeting.
It can wait.
Excuse us?
Well, at least let me offer you a drink first.
Just got a nice imported single malt in, hmm?
That's not the only thing you've got imported.
It's a 1999 Scarpello limited edition.
African blackwood.
Made a chess set out of this once.
It's incredibly dense.
Top of the line.
Like things how I like 'em.
People ever mess with the things you like, Mr. Feeney?
Oh, they're wise not to.
So, uh, Sergeant Wooten-- guess he wasn't too wise, huh?
That's insane.
You think I'd risk all of this for Wooten?
No, not for him, but I think you would for his wife.
Georgia.
Hearing your voice that night, how scared you were, I...
I had to confront Travis.
I-I had to stop him.
He came at me, and once I hit him, I couldn't stop.
I kept pounding and pounding on him over and over again until I couldn't anymore.
I'd do anything for you.
Take me home.
Please?
Tell me, you wouldn't have done the same thing?
So you haven't seen The Hunt for Red October?
BOY:
Nope.
Yeah, it's when Alec Baldwin was skinny.
This your new best friend, Tony?
Oh, he's not here to see me.
Tim McGee?
Meet Tim McGee.
'Sup, dude?
Hello.
I don't get it.
Well, Tim, there are two kinds of identity thieves.
There's the kind you never know, and there's the kind that knows you so well, that they're aware you're not home from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.
You're Mrs. Miller's kid, right?
Nick?
Who is Mrs. Miller?
It's McGee's landlady, the holder of the keys.
Oh.
She also has a bad back.
It was you?
!
You stole my identity?
You sent me an inflatable girlfriend?
You know, I'm out almost ten grand.
Dude, it's fraud, and you're only liable for, like, 50 bucks.
Yeah, dude.
Why?
Why did you do this to me?
You're always doing the same thing.
Go to work, come home, go to work again.
You even order the same take-out food every single night.
Not every night.
Dude, yes.
You got to start living.
You're too young to act so old.
You're welcome.
Can we go to GameStop now?
Yeah, man.
My little dude.
You want to come?
Tony, I got all this paperwork.
I got to...
All right, you know what?
Let's go.
I'd love to.
Excellent.
Smokin' hot chick.
Can she come, too?
Cool it, Nick.
You know you're still gonna owe me that 50 bucks.
Talk to my mom, bro.
You are one hot dog-walker.
Do that again, and I'll kill you.
You love it and you know it.
Seriously, it shows up on Facebook, we're done.
Ooh, so serious.
See, even they're annoyed.
Yeah, well, your dog-walking job's cutting into my breakfast time.
Oh, yeah, well, hold on one second.
I just need to get Odie first.
Odie?
Hey.
Hold this.
Stay.
Hey, boy.
How'd you get out?
Kyle, look.
That's blood.
Maybe he's hurt.
Hey, you okay?
What happened?
Come on, let's follow him.
Odie?
Where is he going?
Come here, boy.
Odie, what is it?
Kyle, what's he doing?
I don't know.
Oh, my God.
Mr. Wooten?
♪ NCIS 8x13 ♪ Freedom Original Air Date on February 1, 2011
It's rude, Tony.
I called you four times.
Well, there's two things wrong with that statement.
One, we're not dating, and two, you know I don't take calls from anyone, especially you, after 7:00 p.m.
You forget I have a life.
What's your point?
My point, McGee-Party-of-One, is that you were leaving me messages, evidently, about some kind of case file.
Yeah, one in which I needed you to sign.
Which you could have waited until this morning for.
Give it to me.
See that?
Now all I have to do is sign it.
Look at that.
Signing John Hancock-- just kidding--
Anthony DiNozzo.
I do not like seeing you two fight.
It's not my fault he's sensitive today.
Hmm.
"Mariposa Luxuries."
I didn't order anything.
Maybe somebody else did.
Timmy's got a secret admirer?
Hmm.
Um...
It's real funny, Tony.
You think I did this?
I would not put it past you.
Guys, come on, a little credit, please.
I have grown past this kind of sophomoric thing.
I mean, who would do something so... genius?
McGee with a plastic girlfriend.
Congratulations, Tim.
She's very sweet.
The receipt's got my credit card information on it.
There must be some mistake.
I would cancel your credit card.
Right now all I need to do is figure out how to deflate this thing.
Oh, that's easy.
There's always a button right here on the back of the neck.
There's no reason I should know that.
Morning, boss.
This isn't what it looks like, boss.
Then what is it, Tim?
Um, a joke, I think, a really bad practical joke.
I'm not laughing.
Lose your gal pal.
Grab your gear.
Got a dead marine in Springfield.
This is really awkward.
All right.
We're looking at Marine Sergeant Travis Wooten, 35 years old, active reservist.
Family?
Married with a six-year-old son.
Wife's a marine-
- Gunnery Sergeant Georgia Wooten.
She's 32.
Boss, according to the dog-walker, our victim was home with his wife and child last night.
She spoke to the wife just before 11:00 p.m.
to confirm picking up the dog.
Does she know where they are now?
Nope.
Greetings, everyone.
Oh, isn't this a terrible sight?
Victim's a marine sergeant, Duck.
Pity about the evergreen.
I doubt that it will survive such a drubbing.
I guess I'm not the only one who kills plants.
Yeah, back in college, my friends used to call me Black Thumb.
They still do, actually, but now it's 'cause I...
I work with dead people.
So not important.
Ah...
There is definite evidence of blunt force trauma.
Some kind of heavy object to the back and sides of the skull.
You got time of death?
Uh... around 1:00 a.m.
He went with a struggle.
There are wounds on the back and front of his hands.
Oh.
Here's something, Doctor.
Looks like part of a twig.
Yeah.
That could be... any of several species in this garden.
Gibbs, I found three plates of food still on the table, and a bathtub full of water.
Wife and child left in a hurry.
Or they were forced to leave.
I also found blood.
Where?
In the master bedroom.
Put out a BOLO.
He might not be our only victim.
Boss, police are canvassing the National Capitol region, but... so far nothing.
- The family contacted?
- Nobody's seen them.
I also talked to
Gunnery Sergeant Wooten's C.O.
He stated she did not request leave or liberty.
Background?
Well, I guess true love's not dead after all.
Travis and Georgia Wooten, they were high school sweethearts.
They joined the Marines in 2000 and got married two years later.
Sergeant Wooten served in Afghanistan, stationed at Camp Leatherneck in Helmand Province.
Disciplinary action?
Nothing-- his service was without incident.
In more ways than one.
The C.O.s called him
"proficient yet unremarkable."
Maybe that's why he stayed a sergeant and she's a gunny.
Well, apparently, the gunny's a real shooting star.
Georgia Wooten...
She was promoted to gunnery sergeant after only eight years.
Qualified for the Marine Enlisted Commissioning Program.
Did several tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Awarded both the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation and Achievement Medals for exemplary service.
That's enough to make any man feel like...
less than a man.
Marriage problems?
Not that we know of.
But the sergeant may have had some problems of his own.
We're still running, uh, credits cards, cell phones, e-mails, but we do know he recently lost his job at a Virginia auto parts plant, and been boozing it up at, uh, Feeney's Billiards ever since.
McGee's got the bank records.
Found multiple charges.
One as recently as last night.
That's an hour before his death.
I'll look for the owner.
I love the smell of fresh felt in the morning.
Do not know what that means, and I do not think I want to.
Uh, it's a little Duvall- Apocalypse Now reference, but, never mind, I'm talking about pool tables.
Traditionally, they're green.
For some reason, these are red.
I did not know you were a pool dolphin, Tony?
Pool shark.
And yes, I was.
In fact, I was the champion of my Baltimore precinct in the late '90s.
"Late '90s"?
That makes you... sound so...
What, old?
Don't say old.
I didn't say it.
You did.
Well, I bet Renaissance Ray wouldn't even know his way around a pool table.
You know, Tony, you do not wear jealousy very well.
Makes your face look all pinchy.
Pinched.
MAN Oh, I know a bickering couple when I hear one.
Len Feeney, owner and operator.
NCIS Special Agent Tony DiNozzo.
This is Probationary Agent
Ziva David.
And we are not... a couple.
Could've fooled me.
We need to ask you some questions.
Oh, sure.
Here.
It's regarding one of your, um... customers...
Sergeant Travis Wooten.
Sure, I know Travis.
One of my regulars.
Is everything all right?
Not exactly.
He's dead.
Oh.
Well, I just saw him last night.
Did anything happen out of the ordinary?
Well, he came in at his usual time, sat in his usual spot...
Practically his second home, huh?
Well, it is for a lot of service people.
That's the way I want it.
Place to feel comfortable.
I, uh, served in the first Iraq War.
I know the challenges our men and women face when they come home, and Travis was no different.
Challenges were getting to him?
Well, he never let it show.
He was always laughing, cracking jokes ... had a lot of friends around here.
Did any of these friends have issues with Sergeant Wooten?
No, Travis' only issue was his lady.
His lady?
You mean his wife?
Well, as far as I know, he was divorced.
He had a girlfriend, though.
She was a real piece of work.
Loved to make a scene.
Always yelling at him.
And she was here last night.
Clung to him like a wet rag.
Yeah. "Wet rag" have a name?
Oh, yeah, Jancey Gilroy.
Yeah, me and Travis were at the club together.
Until what time?
I don't know;
about 12:30 or so.
Then I went home and went to bed.
You have anyone that can verify that?
I don't understand.
He kissed me good night, and told me he loved me.
Said he'd see me later.
He was fine.
Everything was fine.
Not according to the club owner.
Said you were volatile together.
So what?
You think I had something to do with this?
I loved Travis.
We were going to get married.
Except he already was.
No, you're-you're wrong.
He got a divorce.
I helped him through it.
This is Georgia Wooten, and their six-year-old son, Jacob.
They may be in danger now, too.
I don't know anything about them.
I don't know anything about any of this.
Looks painful.
Yeah, well, you try cutting nails all day long and see what happens.
To think
William Penn was a pacifist.
was Travis Wooten, Doctor.
Not him;
those.
Gladwynensis Berberis, otherwise known as William Penn barberry.
Penn, of course, was also a devout Quaker.
Penn as in Pennsylvania Penn?
Yes, Mr. Palmer.
Mr. Penn settled that great land... founded a government, and some of his statutes later became the basis of the American Constitution.
"I wrote the Constitution, and all I got was this lousy plant."
This lousy plant, as you call it, sometimes emits a natural oil that wipes away everything around it.
Lucky break for the killer.
Not so lucky for us.
Ah, Jethro, this, by the way, may take some time.
What I've found so far is troubling.
I counted 11 blows to the head, many more to the back and chest.
Vicious attack.
And determined.
I mean, with that many, the attack must have taken several minutes.
Enough for him to land a few punches himself, Duck?
And get a hand on the weapon.
Mr. Palmer?
The wood taken from Sergeant Wooten's palm was snapped at a downward angle.
In a struggle, a splinter this size could have broken off as the weapon was yanked away.
Did you get prints?
Not yet.
There is another unique marking.
Maybe from a second weapon?
Possibly.
It's a peculiar design.
Abby is working on it.
And then, there are these.
That from the fight?
No.
The wounds are partially scabbed, and the color of the bruises tells me that they're days, if not weeks, old.
You know, Jethro, the nature of this attack suggests someone who's not afraid to get close to their victim, and will stop at nothing to finish him off.
Someone he knew.
Intimately.
State police found Gunnery Sergeant Wooten and her son near the Maryland border.
They're bringing them in now.
McGee, contact Family Services.
Request a grief counselor.
Already made the call.
You might want to call them back.
Now.
Hey, sweetie, I need to talk to these people for a moment, so I'm gonna leave you with these two guys, and I'll be right back, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
You must be Agent Gibbs?
Gunny Wooten.
We've got a counselor standing by if you need one.
I don't need a counselor.
I need to see my husband.
I'm asking you to take me to him.
I want to see him for myself.
One heck of a grieving widow.
I'll call Ducky.
Remove the sheet.
Please?
Take him.
Gunny?
I can't pay for a funeral right now.
Is this going to take long?
I need to get back to my son.
He's in good hands.
I'd rather stand.
Thank you.
You had a lot of people worried.
I promised Jacob we'd go to Kingsland Fun Park for his birthday.
Mm.
What time did you leave?
Just before 11:00.
Fun park open that late?
We wanted to be first in line.
Ah.
Get a hotel room?
Yes.
You tell anybody?
I told my husband.
Told my C.O.
Your C.O. says you didn't request leave or liberty.
He's wrong.
I thought you brought me in here to ask questions about my husband.
Yeah, I did.
Then fire away, Agent Gibbs.
Sergeant Wooten have any enemies?
Besides the ones we're fighting over in Afghanistan?
No.
How about Jancey Gilroy?
His girlfriend?
Travis told me that was over.
Yeah, well, he didn't tell her that.
You having marriage problems?
Well, Travis, uh, lost his job, so... money was tight.
We were... working through it.
We were...
I can't believe he's gone.
I can't believe I get to raise my son alone.
"Get to"?
Hmm?
You "get to"?
My mind's a little scrambled right now.
You look pretty steady to me.
I'm a United States Marine, Agent Gibbs.
Steady is how I'm built.
Steady is what my son needs right now.
Steady... is all I've got.
You're a marine.
You should understand that.
Come on, baby.
Get me all the e-mails and phone records on Georgia Wooten.
Now.
Do it.
Okay, well, just so you know, I'm about...
I plan on filing a complaint.
You want to join the party, McGee?
Since when did banks become so evil?
Since about the 12th century.
I'm out almost $10,000.
They say there's nothing they can do.
What happened?
Well, somebody has accessed my accounts, my credit cards;
they even have my social security number.
And they have been racking up payments on just about everything.
EverQuest online games,
Melissa's Erotic Entertainment.
Hmm.
Oh!
Club Med!
That's new.
My kind of identity thief.
Not a hacker, either.
Uh, how do you know?
My firewall hasn't been penetrated.
Lubricant helps, but everybody has dry spells.
Can't believe this is happening to me.
What if I have to change my name?
TONY Where do I start?
Oh, no.
Don't.
Please, don't.
McClean,
McFly, McQueen, McGeek,
McBankrupt,
McMiserable,
McRib, McGreek...
Hi, Gibbs!
I've a lot to tell you.
Well, n-not a lot, but enough, for now.
Um, meet Steve, and Bill, and...
Rupert;
at least, that's what I like to call them.
They're replicas of Sergeant Wooten;
specifically, his head.
You know, I thought it might be kind of creepy to name a fake head after a real dead guy, and I thought this would be more respectful.
Abbs, what's the point?
Okay.
I re-created each blow using three different weapons, all made from a material similar in composition to the wood that was found in Sergeant Wooten's hand, and all heavy enough to inflict the same sort of damage.
My goal was to see which one best matched up with the head wounds.
And?
And... it's none of them.
Look...
By measuring the depressions in the skull,
I deduced that the one that came the closest was the broom handle.
But here's the kicker:
it's not close enough.
The markings aren't as deep.
Which makes me think that the weapon is-is smaller, so... voilà!
It's a perfect match.
I know.
So here... is the weapon of choice.
Nightstick?
Yeah, or something very close to it.
Also, it was... covered in some sort of stain or varnish, or something;
and it's very rare.
I haven't been able to find a single
U.S. manufacturer.
I'm still looking.
What about the neck wound?
Oh...
I'm not sure about that yet, either.
My best guess is some sort of metal chain.
I can't believe the amount of force used.
Our killer had a lot of rage, Abb.
Gibbs, we confirmed Gunnery Sergeant Wooten did, in fact, lie about requesting leave.
C.O. filed the U.A. paperwork today.
McGee, e-mails?
Well, nothing unusual in her Navy correspondence.
Still tracking down all her personal e-mail accounts.
But...
I do have this.
Gunnery Sergeant Wooten has led dozens of
Marine Corps Martial Arts training programs in Quantico.
Somebody needs a safe word.
When was this shot?
Two months ago.
After she got back from her last tour in Afghanistan.
A lot of anger there.
She's a strong, powerful woman, in a world dominated by men.
That's not anger:
that is determination.
McGee, zoom in.
Looks like she got banged up.
Poor little rookie never had a chance.
Find out why.
Gunnery Sergeant Wooten became overly aggressive with a candidate.
Her conduct was noted and addressed.
That's where the bruises came from?
They were consistent with the incident on that day and prior training sessions, yes.
She get overly aggressive a lot?
No.
First time.
Having any problems with this particular candidate?
Not to my knowledge.
Think the issue went deeper than that.
How deep?
Gunnery Sergeant Wooten is an exceptional marine.
Served as my liaison with Afghan women and children.
Has great focus and skill.
But after her last tour of Afghanistan, that focus has been lacking.
Signs of post-traumatic stress?
Marines are debriefed upon returning from duty.
Physical and psychological evaluations are available to those who need counseling.
The gunnery sergeant need counseling?
Her debriefing showed no need.
You believed that?
I agreed with the evaluations.
Well, I'm not asking for your professional opinion, Major.
Georgia's an incredible woman... great marine and loving mother.
But lately, something's got her all torn up inside, and it has nothing to do with her work here.
These were taken of Gunnery Sergeant Wooten by an emergency room doctor to document what he called "suspected domestic abuse."
Any other E.R. visits?
Five in six years.
All different hospitals.
Were the police contacted?
She refused to press charges.
Was her C.O. notified?
Marine counselors questioned her, but she insisted that her injuries were the result of boxing training at an off-base gym.
She refused the military's help.
Yes.
The only reason she'd lie about that is because Georgia Wooten was an abused woman.
And the guy who was abusing her turns out to be our murder victim?
These bruises and lacerations could be consistent with somebody hitting a target repeatedly.
Target was the wife, Duck.
I wouldn't blame her if she did this.
Nobody would, but that doesn't make it any less of a crime.
She never reported it.
Well, I'm not surprised.
The last thing a woman like Gunnery Sergeant Wooten wants is to be seen as a victim.
No, she's too proud.
Too weak is more like it.
She's a classic case of emotional transference-- strong and powerful on the job because she is completely without power at home.
She was a prisoner.
And perhaps killing her husband is her one chance at freedom.
I got to get her to open up.
Yeah, I agree, but I'm not sure that you're the one for the job.
Agent David has been through things that you and I can't even imagine, and she knows what it's like to be controlled.
I'm not sure I want to open up those wounds, Duck.
Yes, but she may be the only one who can connect with her.
I told Agent Gibbs all I know.
You did not tell him everything.
I know what happened to you.
You have no right, none at all.
I did not come here to challenge you.
And you think this is helping me?
Look, I'm not the enemy.
I only want to find out the truth.
Truth according to who-- you?
Mom,
I'm hungry.
Okay, baby, I'll be in in a second and we'll fix you something.
You need to leave now.
Wait.
I know what it's like to be under the control of a man, to feel like you have no power and the only way to get that power back is to shut down.
You tell yourself you must shut down.
You tell yourself to never show any emotion to anybody.
I know what that's like.
It's the only way you can survive.
I also know what it's like to...
want to seek revenge.
I did not kill my husband, Agent David.
You stay away from me and you stay away from my son.
There is no getting through to her.
She's closed off.
Even with family and friends, apparently.
I spoke to several of them, and they had no idea the abuse was going on.
Blood from the bedroom matches
Gunnery Sergeant Wooten's, boss.
He beat her one last time and then she snapped.
She claims she was at a hotel that night.
Uh, credit card records show no hotel or motel charges, but it looks like she made more than a few calls, boss.
To who?
One to her husband, one to voice mail, and one to him.
Oh.
Well, hello there, Mr. Smooth.
Got calls here dating back several weeks, boss.
Len Feeney told us he didn't even know Georgia Wooten.
Imagine that.
He lied.
I didn't tell you 'cause it's none of your business.
Not our business to know you were friends with the dead man's wife?
Look, Georgia called me a few months ago, looking for Travis.
I'd met her once or twice.
You know, she'd pick him up when he was too drunk to drive.
This time her voice was shaking.
Something was wrong.
I told her to stay where she was, be with her boy.
I'd calm Travis down before he went home.
So you knew about the abuse?
We'd talk, I'd check in with her.
I mean, I would have reported it myself, but she told me not to.
Said it would just make things worse.
But maybe she had other plans.
She ever talk about wanting her husband dead?
Oh, no.
Said she would never kill the father of her child, and honestly
I didn't understand it.
Somebody as strong as her?
Well, I believe Gunnery Sergeant Wooten was too afraid to confront him.
His girlfriend sure wasn't.
Jancey Gilroy?
Mm-hmm.
Travis Wooten attacked her, too?
More like she attacked him.
Happened that night.
Got so bad I almost had to call the cops.
Thanks, Jen.
All right, boss, we got a history of drug and alcohol abuse.
Girl's in and out of rehab.
Got a criminal record?
And does she.
DUI, possession, assault.
She got kicked out of high school for putting another girl in the hospital.
A real Girl Gone Wild kind of girl..
We'll check it out.
Gibbs, Ducky found a small chip of fingernail polish embedded deep in Travis Wooten's arm.
Traced it to Ms. Gilroy's beauty salon.
McGee, got a location?
Boss, she hasn't shown up for work in two days, and her bank just confirmed she cashed out all her accounts this morning.
You got someone looking for the car?
State police.
Find her.
Let me see your hands.
Going somewhere, Ms. Gilroy?
I didn't kill Travis.
I loved him.
Love do that?
We were passionate.
Sometimes we got physical.
So what?
A lot of couples do.
It's no big deal.
It is if one of them ends up dead.
So what happened?
Find out he was married?
You snap?
No.
If the sergeant was married, what do you think that makes you?
We had something special, all right?
He tell you that?
N...
I-I just knew.
Or maybe it is what you wanted to believe.
I thought Travis was different than the other guys.
I thought he really wanted to be with me.
He used you.
He threw me away like a piece of trash.
I got things to offer.
I'm not trash, you know.
Made you angry.
I wanted to hurt him like he hurt me, make him suffer.
So you finished the job?
I'm pregnant.
As mad as I was, I would never kill him.
Sergeant Wooten know that?
I told him that night.
And that is why you fought?
He lost it.
Started telling me he already had a wife and a kid and calling me all kinds of names.
I ran out of the club, I got a cab, and I never looked back.
Well, a D.C. cab service confirms Gilroy took one of their cabs that night.
I don't know whether it was before or after the murder.
Still in communications with them.
I need times.
I've got a time for you, Gibbs.
Well, not a time but something that keeps time-- although I've never really understood that expression because it's not like you can get it back-- you know, time, I mean.
Abby.
Um, okay, so you know that little weird mark that was on the back of Sergeant Wooten's neck?
Not from a chain at all.
A watch band?
A vintage Belle and Sloane 1959 special edition
14-karat gold- plated watch band, to be exact.
There was only 700 sold in the United States, and our killer is wearing one.
Well, then Jancey Gilroy is not our killer.
Cab service just sent over footage from inside the taxi.
Look at this.
Meter begins at 12:37 a.m.
at Feeney's Billiard Club-- note no watch-- and the ride ends at 12:55 at 6301 Kentwood Circle.
That's Gilroy's address-- 20 miles from Travis Wooten's home.
What now, boss?
McGee.
McGee, I'm in autopsy.
Put up Georgia Wooten's training video.
Right, on it.
Fast-forward.
Stop it.
There, zoom in.
Well, it looks like Gunnery Sergeant Wooten fought back after all.
Yeah, and this time she killed.
Nice and tight.
Tuck the chin, drive it through.
Okay.
Gunny, tell your people to stand by.
Sergeant, you've got it?
Corporal McNeil, front and center.
You need to come with us.
I don't understand.
Do not make this more difficult for yourself.
No handcuffs, please, not in front of them.
You're in pain.
You don't know anything about me.
I know more than you think.
July 27, 2005.
Admitted to Bethlehem Emergency for a fractured jaw.
September 4, 2008.
Different hospital.
Lacerations to the legs and arms.
March 17, 2010.
Bruised rib, broken clavicle.
Enough.
I am not a victim.
No.
No, you're not.
You're a survivor.
You know, I, uh...
I could take the beatings.
I mean, they'd happened for so long,
I didn't even feel the pain anymore.
Even when he, uh when he made sure to hit me in places that... no one would see.
But Travis knew
I was getting numb so, he started looking for new ways to hurt me.
You know, to control me.
He was looking for my breaking point.
That night, he found it.
He found the... the one thing that could make me... break.
Your child.
He...
He threatened to take Jacob.
You know, he'd tell the courts that I was unfit, that I been written up for fighting on the job, that I was away on duty more than I was home.
He said, by the time he was done,
I would never see Jacob again.
You can hurt me all you want, but you don't touch my child.
I'd die for him.
Would you kill?
I grabbed Jacob, and I ran.
I mean, I'd run before.
I just always came back, but this time...
I knew we had to disappear.
I knew how to run from my husband.
I didn't know how to kill him.
It wasn't me, Agent Gibbs.
Tony, this is huge.
You realize the FBI says that I might be involved in this Russian identity theft ring?
Calm down, McSpiracy.
Before you go all global, let's take a look at this list of charges again.
Come on.
I don't have time for this.
Back in my Baltimore Homicide days,
I'd do 20 of these a week.
You never did cyber crime.
No, but I did take a Saturday seminar once, and I excelled.
Hit me.
Hmm.
Meltdown Comics,
Lola's Pleasure Chest, GameStop and Relax the Back.
I've got it.
Your identity thief is a 14-year-old pimpled-faced comic book fanatic with severe osteoporosis.
Thank you so much for your help, Tony.
You know I'm here for you.
Talk to me, Abbs.
Oh, I'm not the one who's talking, Gibbs.
That is.
And it happens to have a really thick Irish brogue.
Sorry.
You lost me.
Okay, you remember the varnish chips that I could not trace?
Well, there was a reason for that.
And it comes all the way from the rolling hills of-- wait for it, wait for it County Donegal, Ireland.
The company's called McClendon's Fine Finishes.
They specialize in high-end varnishes that are used for one thing and one thing only.
You want to guess what that is?
Okay.
I'll show you.
Break a pool cue in half, and you've got one killer weapon.
So to speak.
You need to start calling first, Agent DiNozzo.
I'm in a meeting.
It can wait.
Excuse us?
Well, at least let me offer you a drink first.
Just got a nice imported single malt in, hmm?
That's not the only thing you've got imported.
It's a 1999 Scarpello limited edition.
African blackwood.
Made a chess set out of this once.
It's incredibly dense.
Top of the line.
Like things how I like 'em.
People ever mess with the things you like, Mr. Feeney?
Oh, they're wise not to.
So, uh, Sergeant Wooten-- guess he wasn't too wise, huh?
That's insane.
You think I'd risk all of this for Wooten?
No, not for him, but I think you would for his wife.
Georgia.
Hearing your voice that night, how scared you were, I...
I had to confront Travis.
I-I had to stop him.
He came at me, and once I hit him, I couldn't stop.
I kept pounding and pounding on him over and over again until I couldn't anymore.
I'd do anything for you.
Take me home.
Please?
Tell me, you wouldn't have done the same thing?
So you haven't seen The Hunt for Red October?
BOY:
Nope.
Yeah, it's when Alec Baldwin was skinny.
This your new best friend, Tony?
Oh, he's not here to see me.
Tim McGee?
Meet Tim McGee.
'Sup, dude?
Hello.
I don't get it.
Well, Tim, there are two kinds of identity thieves.
There's the kind you never know, and there's the kind that knows you so well, that they're aware you're not home from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.
You're Mrs. Miller's kid, right?
Nick?
Who is Mrs. Miller?
It's McGee's landlady, the holder of the keys.
Oh.
She also has a bad back.
It was you?
!
You stole my identity?
You sent me an inflatable girlfriend?
You know, I'm out almost ten grand.
Dude, it's fraud, and you're only liable for, like, 50 bucks.
Yeah, dude.
Why?
Why did you do this to me?
You're always doing the same thing.
Go to work, come home, go to work again.
You even order the same take-out food every single night.
Not every night.
Dude, yes.
You got to start living.
You're too young to act so old.
You're welcome.
Can we go to GameStop now?
Yeah, man.
My little dude.
You want to come?
Tony, I got all this paperwork.
I got to...
All right, you know what?
Let's go.
I'd love to.
Excellent.
Smokin' hot chick.
Can she come, too?
Cool it, Nick.
You know you're still gonna owe me that 50 bucks.
Talk to my mom, bro.
Hurry up, I know where she is
That's it, guys!
We can post it to everyone.
- We've got the address!
- Great!
We rule!
We did it.
Look, Herve.
- Look.
- Excellent!
We've got it.
Mrs Nabat...
Rue des...
They attack in small groups.
They pick their victim, attacking any pupil using a phone.
A punch in the face and the mobile is stolen.
It's hard for the police to move in this crowd of demonstrators, most of them minors.
The thieves work as a pack, finding and isolating their victim, checking that he's alone, then jumping him as a group.
He's robbed and punched...
Ah, little sister, you remembered!
I'm really touched.
No, I'm not on holiday yet.
The school is an exam centre, anyway.
Noe?
Him too.
He still has sessions in parliament.
So there's no problem.
Mum?
Yes, earlier.
She's OK.
Worried, of course.
It's understandable.
Don't you get all stressed out too!
Dinner, just the two of us.
Yeah, "romantic", if you like.
Noe's doing everything.
Yes?
And Mr Yakihito?
When do they leave?
They've been the thieves' preferred targets for a few years.
This time, the attacked pupils couldn't understand the police's inaction.
I was marching and then
I got punched...
But you...
Oareful, Puss.
But I never expected...
Happy birthday!
- On behalf of...
- Let me!
Dear Mrs Nabat, on behalf of the whole class, now on the verge of our adult lives, we wish you a happy birthday.
Happiness, health and prosperity!
May I kiss you?
Happy birthday.
This is for you.
Thank you.
But how did you find out...?
We're unbeatable at that.
Powerful networking!
It took a lot of research.
- We deserve an A+!
- You can explain.
Oome in.
You must be expecting visitors.
Please.
Just for a minute.
If you insist...
All right.
What's this?
It's for you.
From the whole class.
But...
You're crazy.
I can't accept this.
Bohemian crystal glasses.
Look at the work...
Do you know what they cost?
It's madness, almost indecent.
If it was a bribe, but not coming from us.
No, really.
I've known you since you were 11, but...
I told you they were naff.
We should have got that watercolour.
We all contributed.
I suppose I should thank your parents.
Whatever will they think?
Don't worry, this won't ruin them.
Listen to it ring.
Oan you hear?
Tell us you're pleased.
I don't know what to think.
It's very awkward.
There's the proof you like them!
No, Alex.
Stop that.
Be careful!
You stupid twat!
That's a good test.
If it stains, it's just cheap sparkling wine.
Go on, Gea, make your pitch!
Under his calm exterior, he's not a modest type at all.
He's more...
You couldn't write a pitch!
All you know about is the stock markets.
Once again, we'd like to wish you a fantastic birthday.
Thank you.
Now, then...
Excuse me.
I wanted to warn you...
I've got visitors.
I'll tell you later.
It's complicated.
Lola, do you want one like this?
Herve, stop it!
But hurry up, my love.
I'll be waiting.
- Look!
- We can't stay too long.
There'll be no problem.
Ohill!
We're already inside.
Made yourselves at home, eh?
Here, Mrs Nabat.
No, wait.
We can't drink on an empty stomach.
I can't go to the shop, I'm waiting for the hospital to call.
Is someone ill?
Oan we help?
They're waiting for a kidney for my mother.
We're sorry.
Really.
- Which hospital?
- Hopital de I'Est.
- When they find one, will you go?
- I suppose so.
- Who's the head doctor?
- Professor Oorbin.
Why?
No, stop!
I'll fix us something.
It'll have to be pot luck.
Lola will help you.
Right, Lola?
Go on.
Here...
Give them a quick rinse.
I'd love to have my own flat.
You don't know what it's like, having to live with your mother.
They'll need cutting.
Here's a knife.
But studio flats are really expensive.
It's my dream.
Gea, Lola's talking about a studio flat.
That's our plan, after we pass our exams.
They're all the same.
One day I heard her moaning about overtime.
And she does what?
20 hours a week at the most?
Nowhere near 35.
- You want them sliced?
- If you can.
Will you get a grant?
He's my mother's cat.
Master of the house.
You must have trodden on his paw.
Try to watch out for him.
So you live at your mother's?
Yes.
I was wondering why you gave up a flat at the school and live so far out.
These youngsters aren't rabble.
You can'tjust send the police storming in amongst them.
You have to be more...
Where's the cat?
I've got something for him.
I've checked.
There's only one phone.
Let go!
You get to feel Lola's tits.
- You reckon?
- Let go!
Whose idea was it to come and see me?
Everyone's.
It's not every day we spend time with our principal.
Quite!
The Grand Hotel, Brussels.
We're not going to catch her with peanuts.
My old man says if someone refuses an offer, it's simply not enough.
Isn't he in jail yet?
Still beavering away, not like yours.
Mine's not a thief.
He can't even wheel and deal.
Nothing to be proud of.
Let go of that!
I think we can convince her.
At least you won't have empty stomachs now.
Help yourselves.
- An amazing jigsaw puzzle.
- Oh, no!
- Where was it?
- It wasrt in place.
- I couldn't see where...
- Well, there are 5,000 pieces!
My mother does them.
She's really good.
Where did you find it?
She has an incredible memory.
She'll know where it was.
I'm sure she does them in her mind.
Like chess players.
Does your mum have a hobby?
His mum's a great collector...
She's shagged every man in the school.
A right slag!
- Ohampagne?
- Even choirboys drink it!
One bottle for one, two, three...
The end of our exams!
What's the matter?
Don't be a party pooper!
Just a drop, then.
It's good stuff.
Notjust sparkling wine.
- And me, and me?
- Here you go.
Ohildren,
I wonder if you've come into a world that's reached its breaking point.
Exactly, Mrs Nabat!
Oan you define paranoia?
No.
Seeing a rugby scrum, and thinking they're talking about you!
Oan we have a word?
Do our exam papers go to the markers tomorrow?
- Yes.
- Oh, the stress!
And when will we get our results?
Early July.
Posted in the school hall.
So...
Tell me, what are you going to do next?
Preparation for Sciences-Po.
Are you registered?
I've got connections.
No more maths!
It's not fair.
I won't be doing maths but I still need a good mark.
Did you do badly?
He wants to do literature.
Trouble is, scientists have to know about literature.
And vice-versa.
Take Oharpak or Hubert Reeves...
De Gaulle was rubbish at calculus, and Kafka, hopeless at maths.
Like me.
And they were geniuses.
We've got a self-made Dostoyevsky.
Yeah, but...
For my dad it's degrading.
For a great scientist like him, the world cannot be understood through literature.
Nor through failure.
Your viva will get you in.
- Oome and see.
- "Dostoyevsky"!
If you'd read him!
I'll show you...
- Don't bother, it's too late.
- Dostoyevsky's genius is...
Freedom!
Dostoyevsky gave me the key!
If God doesn't exist, everything is permitted.
Everything!
I understand now.
If I set about it right, no one would have a hold on me.
No more humiliation or fear.
No one to piss me off any more.
It's like growing wings.
You can't be broken.
She can try, with her "do this, do that", so as not to bother my hero dad!
To him I'm transparent, disappointing, not won'thy of interest...
No more feeling empty!
At times I've thought
I should just shoot myself.
Isn't that what my father wanted?
Nice one, 20 out of 20!
Right, Mrs Nabat?
Oome on...
Eat up, don't let it go to waste.
All because of an exam!
You're young, you can try something else.
I'll call your father...
Don't do that!
That would be awful.
I'd never be able to look at him again.
I'd rather kill myself than disappoint him.
Mrs Nabat, we can't leave him like this.
Indeed.
But what more can we do?
I was thinking...
Where are the exam papers?
What do you mean?
You have them, right?
Have you lost your mind?
Gea, what do you mean?
- What's got into you?
- The key to the safe... with the papers in.
Shit!
You bloody idiot!
Oome on.
After the heavy guns, the intellectual!
- Great!
- Don't diss Alex.
He's going to try something on with her.
If it works, he'll drop us.
What's she talking about?
He hadrt better!
I paid him a lot.
And promised him more.
That was the deal.
Do you know something for free?
Love.
I never imagined he'd say that.
- I can't let it go.
- It's not our fault.
We came here for your birthday and now the party's ruined.
That isn't the worst thing.
Yesterday's smooth brow is already wrinkled...
I know you won't agree, but...
We could get your mother into Professor Roussirs clinic.
- Professor Roussin?
- Yes.
The big boss of transplants.
None of his patients dies on the waiting list.
- So?
- I know what I'm talking about.
Hundreds die waiting for transplants.
Don't you want her transferred?
But how?
I couldn't afford that.
I'll tell my dad it's for you.
He won't refuse.
They do each other favours.
Appointments as advisers and so on.
Like Gea's dad.
Well?
Dad?
Yeah, fine.
I'm at Alice Nabat's.
Our principal.
No, with some mates.
Date of birth?
Blood group?
10th August 1928.
The group is AB+.
10th August 1928, AB+.
He'll call me right back.
You're funny, Alice.
It's only natural to help those you love.
- I hope it doesn't stain.
- Alex!
- Quick!
- Gea's gone!
Just as well!
We can't leave him alone.
I'm scared he'll do something stupid.
All that stuff about his dad!
I was calling my dad.
About Mrs Nabat's mother?
Great, Alex.
Alice Nabat's mother comes first.
Oould you still catch him up?
Thank you, Mrs Nabat.
Alex, we wait for the phone call, then we get out of here.
My dad's seeing about a transplant.
He'll call back.
We'd have come with you, but we have to wait.
Sorry, Mrs Nabat, for bothering you with my problems.
You scared your friends.
I'll forget about everything else you said.
Oome back to earth, Gea.
Just be patient.
Your whole life will change now.
It'll be a new start for your mother.
No more dialysis.
That's what my dad said.
Trust him.
Just have to find a healthy kidney without any viruses.
That's all we're waiting for.
I'm starting to hope again.
It's hot in here, don't you think?
It must be the champagne.
It'll wear off.
I'll be right back.
This could take ages.
Shall we put some music on?
You ought to find something you like.
I haven't got everything.
I'm not much into techno!
No, I told you to leave herjigsaw puzzle alone.
Oh, yes.
Very good.
Oome here.
She's got some Marilyn Manson!
It's not going to be easy.
Don't stop.
Underneath the nice exterior, she's really stiff.
- An old spinster.
- You're wrong.
Living with her mother?
And Alex smooching with her...
That's his thing, mature women.
So?
That champagne!
If she likes this music, she's one of us.
Alex will tell you.
I thought you'd only be good at chess.
What an idiot!
A free thinker with a body...
You're a good dancer.
You just have to follow the rhythm.
I haven't danced for ages.
And this music...
Reminds you of someone?
You must have broken lots of hearts.
Every intense experience has its own music.
It could be a chanson, an aria...
Anything.
My head's spinning.
Do you want to lie down?
No, I'd have loved to, but I have to stay here.
No, on the contrary.
She might get a kidney tonight.
As you say.
Yes.
I hope he'll get here soon.
Yes.
I saved you from getting slapped, eh?
Don't get mixed up, Alex.
She's not like your mother, OK?
Hello, you are through to the voicemail of Noe...
Herve?
The cat's pissed.
Pals...
Now that we're all friendly, why don't we show Alice our true selves?
- Our dark face?
- That no one's ever seen?
Oome closer.
Maybe you know about these pocket computers with the exam answers.
I'm learning a lot.
Our armoury and our secret.
We cheated all through school.
For every exam we copied each other.
Or texted people outside.
Really?
Oarry on.
Tell me more.
Yeah, won't be long.
And these final exams?
Were you in contact with the outside?
That's the problem.
But that's ancient history.
Today, our objective is the same as yours.
No one wants to ruin our 90% pass rate, agreed?
Of course I agree.
I knew it.
I've always said so.
You've been with us all along.
We're so alone, but you've always loved us.
You'll help us?
More than it's in your power to do?
She's upping the stakes.
What'll happen now?
The maths is heavily weighted.
They'd never give a zero.
What are you imagining?
There are no instructions, simply examiners.
It depends on each paper.
We've always beaten other schools.
No examiner will mark us down.
The maths paper was tough, but any dunce could do exercises one and two.
I couldn't!
What?
You did it badly too?
I am a dunce.
But no one realised.
I've always cheated, bluffed and lied, and you never realised.
Admit it!
Be quiet!
You're upsetting Mrs Nabat.
We won't get zero, don't worry.
Don't be afraid, Mrs Nabat.
Secret!
- Now's the time.
- Yes.
We've done our research.
The papers leave the school tomorrow and go to the examiners.
We just have to swap them.
Lola might look like just a blonde, but she's a wicked hacker!
She found the software with the answers super quick.
We've prepared papers with the right answers.
Itjust has to be done before tomorrow.
We're not doing anyone any harm.
None of us is going to do maths.
We won't deprive a real genius of a place.
We're no one's rivals.
Our goal is the same as yours:
A 100% pass rate.
Now, take your gifts and get out of here!
What about his reply?
I'm sick of your smooth talk, Alex.
Leave my mother out of it.
She's not for sale.
For sale?
That's going too far!
Mrs Nabat...
Does my death mean nothing to you?
Their lives are in your hands, Alice.
We're losers.
We're being honest.
You still don't understand why we're here.
It's hard for her to accept.
Hello, madam.
I tried calling earlier.
Gaspard...
Hi.
Yeah, fine.
I'll take that for you.
Goodbye.
I'm on my way
Things not too good?
No.
Bad news from the hospital?
My friend's late.
The big departure?
Happy birthday, Alice!
Blow your candles out, Aunt Alice.
Nice to be with your family.
She's lovely.
What are you doing?
The taxi's waiting.
- Goodnight.
- Goodbye.
Happy birthday, with our sincerest wishes...
Stop this nonsense!
Oome on!
Make an effort.
Blow out your candles.
Now...
- Listen to me.
- We're listening.
Because of your age, and only because of that,
I'll overlook this if you apologise.
Your lover isn't very gallant.
Dumping you with a cake!
My mum's had that.
Married men do it.
You're expecting no one, no one's expecting us.
Yeah, we can get everything off our chests.
- Spend all night.
- Don't bank on it!
Oome on.
A key isn't much.
I said no.
We'll persuade you.
- Or force you.
- Believe it!
Get out now!
- Oalm down.
- We're not leaving.
You're taking me hostage?
But we hope to leave as friends.
- Stop being stupid.
- You stop!
You're a civil servant and not very French.
We're untouchable.
You're driving us to crime.
What's got into you, Herve?
And you, Lola?
Nothing to say?
It's a bad dream.
It's reality.
We can help or we can harm.
I've got your mum's name and room number.
Oome to think of it...
Maybe you'd like her to die.
Oh, yeah.
To get the flat.
Oome...
We made some videos we can e-mail to my dad.
He can still save your mum.
As you well know.
He'll find it on his desk.
A victim of sexual abuse.
Anguish for my dad, the courts for you.
- He knows I'm here.
- And we're witnesses.
Oorruption of a minor.
A pupil too!
That's heavy.
Who'd believe that?
You fools!
Alice.
It's me.
Wait.
Olown!
You're witnesses.
I hereby confirm that Alice Nabat is in the habit of taking bribes.
Stop it!
Nothing's happened yet.
You're young, you have your lives before you.
Oh, yeah?
You're soiling all the values we hold dear.
You think that corruption is the answer to everything?
Exactly!
Prove it's not.
You think there'll always be someone with a key?
What planet are you on?
You'll always have exams to pass, because exams are fair.
They're to evaluate you, not bully you.
Not to bully us?
These exams were the first step of adult life.
You'll always be tested.
For work, a new flat, at sport, chess...
But we've always got the marks we've wanted.
Let's get down to business.
A signature.
In the top corner.
Noe?
The hospital.
Yes, speaking.
Her transfer?
Tonight?
Yes.
Extra underwear?
Yes, no problem.
I'll write it down.
Fine.
See you later.
About your mother?
They've got a kidney?
Where from?
Brilliant, Alex!
Your dad's wicked!
You see, everything turns out all right.
Where are you going?
I fixed it so your mother will be saved tonight.
After what Alex's dad did...
Who can I trust now?
No one stopped me!
This'll cost you dear.
Threats, blackmail, bribery of a public official...
You could go to prison.
Even if I gave you the key.
We know all that.
And better than a Spaniard.
"Whosoever offers, promises or grants an unjustified benefit
"to a member of the judiciary,
"a public official, an assessor, blah blah blah...
"for their own advancement,
"will be liable to a sentence of five years' imprisonment
"and a fine of..."
To break the law, you have to know it.
I was suckled on it.
In the cradle!
We know who makes the laws.
We crush them!
Let me go.
No problem.
One cannot fight alone on every front.
Rest now.
That's it.
Let yourself go.
You're right.
Where are you going?
Is Mrs Nabat's daughter here, please?
There are no visits now.
Look at the time.
I can empathise.
It's for her mother.
Have to be quick now.
This is the money the security guard at school asked for.
But the key isn't enough.
You have to come.
The guard has to see us together.
No risk of a double-cross.
It'd be easy to shop us tomorrow.
You're talking to your principal!
You little brats!
You're trying to teach me about life?
Me?
Wipe your snotty noses first!
You're nothing but parasites, sucking the blood of others.
You've got peas for brains and heels to make you taller.
With money...
With money as your only god!
Lola, the papers.
You think you're in control?
You're just baby calves jostling at the manger.
You stink!
- Alice...
- Shut up, you runt!
The evil mastermind, eh?
You're just a piss-poor little corporal!
The least little setback will have you grovelling and falling over yourselves to betray the others.
You were that close to making me cave in.
That close!
And you were close to believing in the hospital.
The phone call was fake.
This is brilliant!
You really are barbarians.
With a powerful network.
Grab her, Gea.
We're making things worse.
Hold her.
We had a deal.
Search her.
Get away from me!
You think you're untouchable?
- Maybe we shouldn't.
- Do you want to pass?
Don't be scared.
You won't feel a thing.
Nothing.
Hurry up!
We'll deal with her later.
We have to go.
Turn the place upside-down.
You don't believe in anything.
- What do you believe in?
- In Alex and victory.
We'll say she's right and ask her to forgive us.
- Let's go.
- Oh, yeah, and I'll get zero!
Better that than prison!
What's her problem?
She shouldn't have come.
Has she scared you?
That's what she wanted.
She won't do anything.
Too many principles.
She's held up well.
Even with that champagne.
Did you deliver the cake?
Personally?
What time?
OK, thanks.
Fuck!
No labels.
This is pointless.
You dickhead!
Get out of the way!
Alice, here we are.
Don't stay on your own.
Open up.
Open up.
Go on, Puss.
OK, I'll give you another two minutes.
You shouldn't have wound him up, Lola.
Women!
- How should I take that?
- Stop it!
It's getting late.
One minute left.
It's no longer about whether she'll turn us in or not.
- We have to make her an accessory.
- Her, an accessory?
You're mad.
I'll go even further,
I know how to break her.
It's me.
Is Alice with you?
When did you talk to her?
No, I'm not worried.
Goodnight.
Damn, did I wake you?
I'm looking for Alice.
Go back to sleep.
Yeah.
See you tomorrow.
Who'll give us the key if we...?
Violence on her would be stupid.
But on someone else, before her eyes...
It works with my mother.
Find the cat.
I've never seen anyone dead.
Havert you had enough?
- You'll end up in ER.
- And you, in prison!
She's alive.
Alex.
I told you to tie her up.
People like her never give up.
- And you...
- Stop it!
Mrs Nabat...
Does it hurt?
Wait.
Don't move.
Leave me alone!
Want some more?
Stop it, I don't want to drown!
- No one can hear you.
- Let him go.
Let him go.
You're sick!
It's OK, Alex is going to ask a doctor.
My ankles... my feet...
Does it hurt elsewhere?
Oan you see us?
I'm thirsty.
Where are the glasses?
What did you try to do?
Escape?
You're not a kid any more.
I'm not being bitchy.
I think you're tough.
I must have slipped.
It's my ankles.
They really hurt.
Have you seen the time?
I know.
Give me a cloth.
Be right back.
Stop it, you're hurting me.
Alex is calling his dad.
You believe him?
Oall my doctor, please.
I'm sure you have a mobile.
What do you take me for?
Your doctor!
You're not the only stubborn one.
We know what we want too.
This'll make you laugh...
I'd have loved to say "thank you" to you.
If I don't pass...
Yes, your mum told me.
The tap, please.
When?
You saw her?
Oall a doctor, please.
I can feel it swelling.
It must be broken.
She told you, no more school?
She told me everything.
Even about your Miss Savoy crown.
Miss Savoy?
I was only 14.
No one knows.
What a bitch!
That was her dream, the front page of celebrity magazines!
Better than the crime pages.
You're in more danger than them.
The worst will happen, because of you.
You already have a record for theft.
Your private school passed it on.
- Your 3 friends don't.
- Shut up!
There's still time to save yourself, Lola.
My ankles are broken.
Get me help soon, or your whole family will pay.
I don't give a toss!
Let them pay!
I've worked it all out.
I'm even been calculating in saving my virginity.
I'll make it work for me.
But you love Gea.
- It'll go to the highest bidder.
- You bitch!
You loser!
The highest bidder?
Who?
Isn't a studio flat enough?
You won't get that.
Or me.
Don't start shouting.
What did you say?
Shut up!
I can't stand shouting.
Lola, don't shout.
Get off me, you clown!
Isn't your dad paying for your flat?
You're mad!
Shit, I'm dying.
Quick, get me to the bog.
Is this because of her?
She's all I've got.
I can't lose her.
I have the fake papers.
Do you get the shits a lot?
Did you believe her when she said she's a virgin?
I could have shagged her, easy.
I'll smash your fucking face in!
It's five percent.
That won't do any harm.
It's not much.
My dad drinks too.
But when he's pissed, you can listen to him for hours.
And he's brilliant at arithmetic.
Not like me.
He said to me once, "My little Herve,
"I'm a piece of shit." Just like that.
"I sold my soul for money and drank the lot!
"So don't you start drinking."
I promised
I'd never do what he did.
You're no better than your father, alcoholic!
What was that?
You're a child playing at being a matador.
Me?
A child, not a matador?
Did you hear that?
Me?
- What are you doing?
- Get off!
Get off!
El toro...
See it?
Good and stiff for you!
I'll come all over you, your head, your belly, your national curriculum...
Yeah, it's coming!
It's coming!
Idiot!
You'll spoil everything!
What about Gea shitting himself?
He let the cat get away.
It's me, open up.
What's she doing?
I don't believe it!
Yes, is that directory inquiries?
There was no more paper.
So I used some euros.
Puss?
Puss!
Yes, a fall, that's right.
How long?
Her address?
It's...
Her name's Alice...
Mrs Nabat... 77 Avenue...
Don't move.
Don't move!
Nice and tight.
Wanted to get us caught, eh?
Alex, I'm shitting my insides out.
Do something, please.
Oome here!
Help!
Anyone!
If she talks, you get your flat.
I've found the Valium.
That'll work.
You're cured.
Havert you got some medicine for me?
You suspected Alex, and it's you, the traitor!
Nice one, Alex.
You've got what you wanted.
Take me into my bedroom.
Don't worry, Mrs Nabat.
We'll tidy up tomorrow.
And Herve'll fix the phone.
He's a pro.
To think you're pupils of Descan'tes High School.
Descan'tes was a mercenary who killed 27 people.
I'm more powerful than you, Alice.
Don't drink it!
Right from the start they've wanted to abuse you.
I was your pupil but you don't know me.
I'm a Romantic, I'd sacrifice everything...
For power!
A night like this is quite an experiment.
But for this experiment an animal won't do.
See to her feet.
Open up.
- I'd prefer a pick-me-up.
- Of course.
- Show me.
- I've swallowed it.
Stop it!
Gea, stop it!
Another?
Such pitiless times!
Nice one, Alex!
That's what you wanted.
Even Gea is your lackey now.
Like Herve.
Are you keeping score?
What do you think?
I don't want to be here either.
Do you see Professor Lemarchand's son here, begging?
No!
His place at university was reserved all along.
Not mine!
My dad refused any compromise as a point of honour.
So I have to pay.
Untie me.
Let's go!
I can't get in to do literature.
And the supposed virgin humiliates me.
Why should I give up that place?
It's mine!
I've seen your dad's work in genetics.
He really is an honest man.
What do I say to that?
"Thanks"?
Honest people should be gassed so they don't reproduce!
And you'd be our saviours?
- Not Herve.
- You're loathsome!
- Dumping him like that...
- He's right.
He's finished.
Every society has its dregs.
You've finally said it!
Such thinking could only come from a fascist, a mafioso...
Scum!
Go on, show Herve how you torture!
Oheers, Herve.
I won't leave you any.
Mrs Nabat, I'm sorry.
Your phone...
I swear I'll fix it for you.
And a jigsaw for your mum.
I'm sorry.
I love you.
You're my favourite woman in the world.
But not... not that shouting.
Your eyes caress me like velvet.
Propose to her, Oasanova!
Yes, I can do that.
I love you.
Get me a pass... and I'll do it.
Give me your hand...
I feel ill, Alex.
Quick, where's the bog?
Help him.
Somebody help him.
Herve, please.
I'm begging you, untie me.
Please.
I'm begging you, Herve.
Untie me.
Pathetic!
We reject him, so you forgive him!
I feel sorry for your victims.
That wreck!
It's easy to make someone drink.
Just keep telling him to stop.
- As you did.
- You too.
Oart you stand?
Alex, don't leave me here.
What's that?
Blood?
I think he's bleeding.
Get off me!
Blood's not like champagne.
It's a lot messier.
It's blood after all.
Harder to get rid of.
I'm putting myself in your shoes, Alex.
It can't be easy.
But make an effort!
Get him in the bathroom.
You can patch him up without getting your hands dirty.
I'll untie Lola, she can do it.
You're loving this!
Poor Alex.
An army of incompetents.
So unlucky!
Hurry, I'm going to shit myself!
Hurry up!
It'll get everywhere.
Herve, get out of there.
TV12, come in.
No answer.
Sorry, sir.
I'll keep on trying.
TV13, come in.
OGT here.
Do you have a unit available?
Negative.
All busy.
I'll be right back.
She can walk!
The bitch!
You tricked us.
Not even a scratch.
I was dying, pissing blood, and you just lay there and watched!
You motherfucking bitch!
Go on, harder!
- You fat cow!
- Do it!
- And you called me a torturer?
- That's fucking good!
You wanted mercy?
Go on!
Why are you stopping?
You'll tell us in the end.
Where is the key?
- Go on, Gea.
- What are you doing?
He doesn't want to dirty his hands.
Trying to put it all on me?
Ask him what he gave you to drink.
You keep your mouth shut!
I dare you, Gea.
Ask him.
What?
Don't fall for it, Gea.
Is that it?
Poison?
My best mate poisoned me?
What did you give me?
You're pathetic!
You don't give a toss about the key!
Why did you come?
Thought she'd be a better shag than your mum?
Shut it!
Havert you guessed?
It's for Lola.
That proves it.
Is that right?
For Lola?
You fucking scumbag!
You wanted to watch me die!
She poisoned you.
Look...
You win, Alice.
Oongratulations.
It ends with your triumph.
The game is over.
How can we obtain your forgiveness?
Is it over?
Yes, we're going.
You clowns!
Jokers!
You make me puke!
Go and puke with Herve.
I hate you!
You're pathetic.
You've got no pride...
Not the least bit of dignity.
Nice one, princess.
Lovely denouement.
There you go, old pal.
Never trust a bird.
I thought it was all over, but listen...
You're insane!
The bitch was right.
You're a total loser.
No balls!
Move.
Move!
Get up!
Oome on!
- Get up!
- Ouch!
Hurry up.
Hurry up, move!
She's at breaking point.
One last scare and she's done.
No.
Forget it.
You disappoint me.
You've collapsed the edifice and insulted the artist in me.
- Don't be like that.
- Shut it!
All you care about is your bird.
Don't count on my dad any more, OK?
Mrs Nabat?
Open up.
Open the door, Mrs Nabat.
It's me.
There is no Mrs Nabat any more.
What's going on?
Where am I?
Don'tjust stand there.
He'll fall asleep again.
Show some fucking dignity!
Shut up and listen.
Stand up.
- Sacrifice...
- No!
No, not the bathtub, Alex!
Are you mad?
- Where are we going?
- I need you for the last stretch.
Did my sleeping beauty say yes?
Have we got the key?
Fetch Lola, and we'll get the key.
Get out of the way!
I'm finally going to get what I paid for.
- What do you want?
- It's all right.
We'll finish it and go.
But hold her and don't let go.
Hold her and don't let go.
Let me go!
Let me go!
Gea, make her keep quiet.
Dear Alice Nabat, have you ever seen a gang-bang?
You'll be accessory to one under your mother's roof.
You've got one minute.
Let me go!
On the armchair.
- OK, Gea?
- Why?
Dickheads!
Get her on the armchair.
Ask Alice where she keeps her sheets.
Olaiming to be a virgin is pretty dodgy.
For the last time, Alice Nabat...
- You won't!
- You'd better believe me.
Gea, move!
Get her kit off.
Are you coming?
Move yourself!
Understand what we want of you?
Don't touch me!
I have to explain it all!
Be a good girl...
Trust me.
Trust me...
Those thighs!
How can you stay unmoved, Gea?
She's getting me good and hard.
You'll regret it, Gea.
- Don't you think so, Herve?
- Yes.
- Help me, Herve.
- How?
Let me go!
Hold her better.
Lola, can I?
Make her shut up!
It's not real, is it?
Give me a sign, I'll understand.
Hold her better!
Don't be scared, Lola.
We're only pretending.
- You'll pay, Gea.
- I've had enough.
Alex, you said it was pretend.
Oatch her.
Oatch her!
Get out of my way, twat!
Don't you touch her again, or I'll show you!
You dare to threaten me, you runt?
You're all shit!
Drown in it!
Ohoke yourselves on it!
Eat it!
I don't like my triumph being disturbed.
No, get out of the way!
Stop it!
Stop it, Alex!
You scumbag, stop it!
Stop it!
Scumbag!
Get away from me!
Let her go.
Do you hear me?
Let her go, I said.

Maker's blood!
- I have the gift!
- The curse, you mean!
My uncle trained me, I know healing spells.
- Apostate!
- No, wait.
You say you're a healer, little elf?
Yes, lady.
A good one.
Prove it.
Go on, heal.
Anytime now.
Good boy.
You stabbed me!
You wanted to prove a point, I proved it was my point.
You can come along, but the mage is our priority.
Let's go.
I am not working with an apostate!
My job is to lock them up, or exterminate them!
That boy is extremely dangerous!
You'll have to come along to keep an eye on him then, won't you?
You're going the wrong way.
My uncle would have protected our clan from the attack but he was taken months ago.
We hope that he escaped the Chantry.
Find his way back to us.
Few escape the Templars.
That's funny, the Saarebas did.
Maybe you met him!
A Dalish mage imprisoned in Kirkwall, he's name is Yevven.
Dead.
The Chantry killed him?
Of course not!
He was being examined.
He was killed during the escape.
Saarebas did it.
To hide his trail to the Dalish camp.
The Keeper told Saarebas where to find the mask?
Of course.
Try to keep up.
Josmael?
You've been silent for leagues.
Doesn't seem your specialty.
With my uncle Yevven dead...
That means besides Fina, everyone I love is gone.
Better to happen young.
It's less painful that way.
A follower of the Qun feels not love, for nothing should tyrannize their heart.
Religious?
Just like to hear myself speak.
Love doesn't tyrannize!
It's the only thing that matters in this world.
Without Fina, I'm nothing.
You two are old.
- Thanks!
- Thanks.
So you probably don't remember when you first met, the feelings you get when you look in each other's eyes!
Ohh!
- That's, uh...
- You...
- You have it wrong.
- No...
The Templar and I are not together.
But you love someone, right?
I loved my family.
Loved?
As Templars we're not allowed to marry.
We're wed to the Church.
Sometimes... that's lonely, but its the life I've chosen.
Our stations have that in common.
The Qunari assign us partners, if we are ever allowed one.
It's much easier that way.
Feelings just, uh...
They lead to trouble.
Not with us.
I'll find Fina if I have to walk to the ends of the Earth, down the deep roads into the abyss of...
Alright, well, I don't think we'll have to travel that far.
We're catching up.
The Phylactery is pointing to that cave.
Saarebas is in there.
And he's not alone.
Come on, let's go.
As a drowning man knows the sea, so does a mage know magic.
Wonderful magic.
Trapped.
Perfect!
We go around the right, get the girl out of danger first.
Our only goal is the mage, you said that yourself.
Calm yourself, child.
This small sacrifice...
Bards will tell tales of you.
What is a little blood...
For a lot of power!
Fina!
Maybe I should have let you kill him!
It's not too late.
Incapacitate who you can and stay in the back!
I'll annul the mage's magic with the Phylactery, you punch him and get the collar on.
Good plan!
Rouges?
I'm here to save you, love!
The Saarebas!
I'll show you magic, elf.
You.
Reaver, earn your fee!
The first step...
The mask.
Josmael, leave it!
It's my duty!
Saarebas, remember this?
Never again!
I serve the Qunari no more!
I serve myself!
Blast you, mage!
Rogues!
No!
No!
Stop!

Raised as an animal, collared, used as a weapon...
I'd destroy all that's in front of me too.

'My name is prem.
I was introduced to you in the end.'
Hello, mr.
Aasim.
- Hello!
'This is my family.
The people you see on the screen right now... ' 'the gentleman is my father.'
'And the lady is my mother.'
'My dad has a terrible habit of... what was it again... ' 'yes, of forgetting things.
Come, i will show you the proof.'
You are that.
- That?
Welcome to the wedding.
- Yes.
Come inside and keep that.
The gift?
- That.
No, no, no, that.
That.
Please have a seat.
- Please have a seat. - thank you.
Welcome.
Welcome.
- Hello. - hello.
Wow!
The steamed potatoes have no steam in them.
And there is no saffron in the saffron sweetmeat.
Really?
What really?
I was just tasting them.
Look, what happened with all the tasting that you've done.
'That's prem's uncle, laxman kapoor.'
'And his wife, kiran.'
"I love you.
I love you.
I love you."
What is it?
You are dancing with joy.
Why?
- You didn't dance so much at our wedding.
I'm celebrating someone else's joy.
That was a suicide.
- Suicide?
My joy.
Does anyone dancing when he is happy?
Not suicide.
'That's prem's uncle, bharat kapoor.'
'And his wife, suman.'
Look, brothers, if there is that at that then that will happen.
What that and that will happen?
If there is lack of anything at the wedding then we will get defamed.
- Okay.
Okay.
Don't worry, brother...
- everything will be fine. - sure?
'These three brothers love each other a lot, like ram, laxman and bharat.'
'And co-incidentally their names are... ' '... ram, laxman, bharat.'
By the way, where is my that?
That?
Liquor bottle?
- No, brother.
Not during the day.
It will ruin the wedding.
- No, it is taller than a bottle.
That... that...
- the bride.
She is inside.
- Not the bride.
That... that... a child.
- How can there be a child when he is not married?
My child.
My child.
- His child.
Prem.
Prem.
Say that.
Where is that idiot?
- No, brother.
Don't call him an idiot.
This wedding is taking place because of him.
- Yes.
Khushi would have never agreed if he wouldn't have reasoned it out with her.
- Right.
'Khaman dhokla'.
- 'Khaman dhokla'... - brother... gaurav had gone inside to meet khushi for two minutes.
Half an hour has passed by.
Go and check what's happening.
The auspicious hour is passing by.
- Really?
'It is their friend and neighbour mr.
Pathak's daughter's wedding... ' '... whose name co-incidentally is khushi.'
Khushi.
Khushi, my child.
Where are you?
Son-in-law.
Son-in-law... what happened?
Who did all this?
Where is khushi?
She ran away.
- She ran away?
She ran away with her lover.
- Lover?
Who is her lover?
Your neighbour, the kapoors... their pampered, spoilt, rascal, scoundrel son.

You are now husband and wife.
Click a photograph.
Just a second.
Click it.
Click it.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I was not in town.
If you wouldn't have helped her run away her father would have got her married to someone else.
Yes.
And i would have become someone else's wife.
Not a chance.
Here's my card.
You are a registrar here.
We know.
No, no, no.
This is my other card.
I'm also a divorce lawyer.
I've dissolved more marriages than i've performed.
And looking at the two of you i feel that you will definitely need me in future.
I know love is blind.
But marriage makes everyone see things clearly.
Do you see things clearly?
I'm still blind.
I've already married thrice.
I'm waiting to get married for the fourth time.
What kind of a man is he?
- Thank you.
Let's go.
Let's go.
We don't want your card.
Sir.
Sir, at least take the card.
Sir... who is he?
- He was getting married to her.
Look, brother, she was being forcefully to marry you.
And that's why... - forget it.
I was being forced to marry her.
What?
- I had come to tell khushi that i love kiran.
But i didn't get a chance to talk.
I was hit with a stick on my head and i fell unconscious.
I won't spare you.
- Brother, no... stop it, gaurav.
Stop it.
We should thank them.
- Yes.
We wouldn't be together if he wouldn't have helped khushi elope.
Say thanks.
Kiran.
- Hi.
How are you?
Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
Hurry up, the two of you.
Come here and get married.
I have to go and get someone divorced.
Let's go.
It's time for our flight as well.
We'll make a move.
Thank you so much.
- See you.
Take care.
Brother prem.
- What?
Brother prem, everyone inside... pathak shitting petrol.
Shitting?
- Seating sofa.
Oh, seating.
- Yes.
Okay.
You parking bike.
I'm seeing how much shitting.
He is here.
He is here.
He is here.
I'll set myself on fire.
I'll kill myself.
This drama has been going on since last night.
Neither is he sleeping nor is he letting us sleep.
Whenever he dries a little he wets himself again with petrol.
Mr. Pathak, if you wish to set yourself on fire please do so outside, in the garden.
Why are you burning our house with you?
- Quiet.
Yes, exactly.
You heard that?
You heard that?
After ruining my family he is talking about his house.
Daddy, why don't you dive and snatch it?
Shut up.
You have done that.
- Awrong thing.
Awrong thing.
Yes.
- Stay away.
Stay away.
Stay away.
I'll set myself on fire.
Brother...
- stay away.
Stay away.
Stay away.
Brother, khushi is notjust your daughter but his friend as well.
Yes.
- Yes.
I'm sure she must have seen something special in raju.
I'm sure the day you see them happy, you will forgive them.
That day will never come in my life.
And there are hardly any days left in my life.
Perhaps not even one.
Yes.
He is right.
He is right, right?
Then keep this aside.
I'll commit suicide.
- You... i'll commit suicide.
- Who are you threatening?
I'll help you.
Does anyone have a lighter?
No, i don't have it.
This lighter... - you started smoking?
- You started smoking?
Shame on you.
- Brother, i didn't... don't change the topic.
What were you saying?
I'll help you deep fry.
What are you doing?
Prem?
- What is this?
What are you doing?
What are you doing, prem?
Prem?
Prem?
- Will mr.
Pathak's death affect anyone of you?
No.
- No. - will the world end?
What... what... what... i will burn him down.
Okay.
I won't spare you.
I won't spare you.
- Prem.
Prem.
You'll ruin everything.
- Prem.
Something has to be done about this boy.
Hello, guru.
Hello.
- Come.
Come, ram.
Have a seat.
Have a seat.
Look, ram...
- yes?
Prem has done a good deed by uniting two lovers.
Guru, he ended brother and mr.
Pathak's age old friendship.
Yes.
- Prem that's the talks of his marriage even before it starts.
What is it called?
- Ends. - he ends it.
Last month guru sent a dog to your place, right?
Yes.
She is very nice.
- Yes.
She keeps everyone happy.
- Yes.
He sent two maids for household chores.
Naina and sunaina.
They are very nice girls.
But cannot get prem married to them.
- Right.
Right.
Similarly, guru has found a bride for prem.
Ram, listen to me.
You know the malhotras from america... yes.
- Their daughter is perfect for prem.
Yes.
She is a bandit queen.
A bandit queen?
- A bandit queen?
Phoolan.
- Only her behavior.
She is very good at heart.
Her name is pooja.
- Wonderful!
She is the only girl who can change prem.
Guru, then why are you doing that in this?
Why are you delaying this?
- Why the delay?
She is coming to bangkok tomorrow for her friend's wedding.
It will be great if prem likes her.
Whether prem likes her or not only pooja will come to our house as that.
What?
- A bride.
- A bride.
A bride. - yes.
Hello.
- Karan, i've been trying all six numbers of yours since so long.
Tell me what happened to the wedding.
I ran away from the wedding.
But my passport is with them.
What?
It'll take at least 10-15 days to make a new passport.
But what will i do in the meanwhile?
They will find me.
I'll call you later.
- Hello!
Hello!
Hi, pooja.
Do you need a ride?
No, thank you.
Prem and his uncle are coming to fetch me.
Prem, pooja is coming at terminal 3 why are we standing at terminal 7?
That's the game plan.
- Why are you throwing it?
How will pooja recognize us?
That's what i want.
She shouldn't recognize us.
Why what are you doing?
What is this... this... is a proof for my father that we went to the airport but pooja malhotra didn't come here.
So we came here...
- uncle, tell me one thing.
Neither you nor i have ever seen her.
Nor has anyone in the family has seen her.
Guru has sent an imported pooja malhotra from america so that she marries me and changes me?
- Correct.
Uncle, i need a very impish, roguish and talented wife.
Impish, roguish and talented?
But nowadays it's so difficult to find an impish, roguish and talented wife.
All of them are married.
I am there.
But what will tell our guru?
Let the guru's mother go to hell.
Does he have a sister?
- Yes.
Then we shall send both of them.
- Okay.
Both mother and sister will go to hell.
Prem.
Who called me prem so hatefully?
What did you think?
I will wait for you at terminal 3?
And you will click a photograph here... , and fool father?
- Pooja.
How did you recognize us?
Not you, him.
Daddy had given his description when i was leaving america.
I scanned the entire airport.
He was the only rogue with an innocent face.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
What an image you have, prem.
I'm proud of you.
Why are you in a wedding dress?
What did you think?
I'll come from america in a two-piece bikini?
It would've been better.
- Just shut up.
Come on!
Let's go.
Excuse me.
Don't take advantage of the situation.
And don't you dare touch me.
Let's go.
Wow.
Impish, roguish and talented.
I should have asked for something else, uncle.
What better could have you asked for?
Think about it.
Ayoung and old imp at home.
And they will bet on who is more impish.
Your aunt and she will get along well.
Truly.
I'll bet on your girl.
They are here.
Pooja is here.
Pooja is here.
Brother, is she pooja?
Or has he brought some other girl from her wedding?
You all must be surprised, right?
Seeing me dressed as a bride.
You see, a girl looks her best in a wedding dress.
So, i told myself, "pooja, don't take a chance."
"If you want to impress everyone..."
"...then go dressed as a bride.
- Very impressed."
Impish.
Okay, tell me, how did you like our prem?
Yes.
How did you like you?
I liked all of you a lot.
Very talented.
And if all of you support me then we will change him for good as well.
Talented also.
- Okay.
Then all of us are with you.
Come in.
Come in.
Come in.
- Come in, dear.
She will change him for good.
She didn't bring any bags with her.
What was the need to bring any luggage?
I'm not staying in a hotel.
I'm staying with my in-laws.
There is anything lacking in here?
Yes, only that like you was lacking.
That... what?
- What do you call a son's that?
Daughter-in-law.
- We were only lacking a daughter-in-law and now your presence has changed that as well.
Your father has become that.
- Mad?
Should i tell your father?
You are saying such things about my elder brother?
Yes?
Tell us, when are you going for the wedding?
I just ran from a wedding.
You ran away from it?
But you were going to phuket for your friend's wedding, right?
Yes, i was going to.
What do you mean, "i was going to?"
If you didn't go there then how did you ran away from it?
By ran away i mean i got rid of it with great difficulty.
Why would i unnecessarily waste my time in phuket?
That's right.
Why waste time in phuket?
If i would attend my friend's wedding then how would i make arrangements for my wedding?
And i have to fulfil the responsibility guru has given me.
She will marry you.
She is wishful-serpent.
I will never let her wish come true.
Sir, pooja's on the line.
Pooja?
- Pooja?
It's for pooja.
Give it to me.
Hello.
Hi.
How are you?
I'm standing at the airport since the last two hours and you are asking how are you?
I'm not okay, understand?
My friend.
The one who is getting married.
She is very angry.
Anyway, look, i am waiting at the airport, come on.
And he didn't come to pick me up.
- Didn't get the time.
I have come here from america and he didn't get the time?
If you don't believe me then talk to prem's dad.
I?
- Dad, she is calling all of you.
Tell her that you all are not free.
- Yes.
Look, we cannot come.
We don't have that.
Tell her that we don't have a car.
- No, we have a car.
The thing that moves like this.
Pendulum.
- We don't have a pendulum.
Excuse me?
- Time.
No, we don't have time.
Sorry.
Heard that?
Now do you believe me?
If you don't have time then even i am not stupid to waste my time for you over here.
I'm going to attend my friend's wedding.
And i'll go to guru's ashram after 8-10 days.
If you finally have the time and you wish to meet me then you can come there.
Understand?
Okay.
That's a great idea.
Bye.
Come, pooja, i'll take you to the guestroom.
Aunt, am i a guest that i'll stay in the guest room?
I'll stay in prem's room.
In prem's room?
- Before this?
Before marriage?
Until we get married, prem will stay in the guestroom.
Yes.
Don't worry about him.
He can also sleep on a table.
Look, he is sleeping.
Ma'am, if you want to stay then stay in the guestroom otherwise, i'll make you disappear in such a way that even google.
Com won't be able to find you.
Prem.
- Daddy, my room... uncle, cool down.
Now i am here.
I'll handle it.
Now look here, my future husband.
For now, i have just snatched your room.
After that i'll snatch your sleep and peace of mind as well.
I'll make you empty.
Empty.
You...
- no abusing.
Come, aunt.
Show me my room.
Go.
Go.
Show it to her.
- I'll be right back.
Brother, she will set him straight.
Isn't she very delicate?
- She is a lizard.
A lizard.
I don't know where that girl is.
I'm telling the truth.
You lost her.
My men couldn't find her.
Where did she go?
She doesn't know anyone in the city.
And no one knows her.
Where can she go?
Where can she go?
Where?
Where?
Hit him.
I want her at any cost before suraj chaudhary to her.
Someone stop me.
She is one piece from head to toe.
How do i cut her into pieces?
Prem, control your mind.
I'll control my mind but... this girl with a face that looks a mix of banana and mango... if you scream this rampuri dagger will take to straight to lord rama.
You are taking advantage of the situation.
Situation?
Advantage?
Again?
She will yak and force someone to think about it even if he isn't in the mood.
But what will you gain by killing me?
The ceo of fools, i won't benefit from it, you will.
I'll double your value.
- What?
How much is a live chicken worth?
- Rs.100.
And how much is a tandoori chicken worth?
- 200.
So doesn't that double the value after death?
You will snatch my peace of mind?
You will snatch my room?
If you don't leave by tomorrow morning then i swear by baba ramdev i will kill you.
What happened?
- What happened, dear?
What happened?
- What happened?
What happened?
She must have had a nightmare.
She must have screamed.
A lot can happen in a nightmare.
Like... yes, a sneeze.
I was dreaming?
- Look, she is agreeing.
Come on, go back to sleep.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- She was dreaming.
Let us know if you need anything.
- Let's go.
Okay, goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Never underestimate three things in life.
Shucks... me, me and me.
Now you only bloody decide whether you have to come to this house in a palanquin or you want to leave this house... as a dead person.
"Oh, lord of the whole universe."
"Mighty lord of the whole universe."
"All thy devotees' agonies..."
"all thy devotees' sorrows..."
"instantly thou banish."
"Oh, lord of the whole universe."
Great.
I feel i am going to have a great day in office.
After all my day began with such a nice prayer.
You have been named aptly.
We are feeling as if we are in hardiwar.
- Yes.
We have got such a nice daughter-in-law.
Dear, you are so cultured and you have such good values in spite of living in america.
Bush taught obama and obama taught her.
So who is her mother is in america?
Obama?
Listen... to celebrate pooja arrival we will distribute that in the office.
That...
- tennis ball?
No, not that.
- Paperweight.
'Ladoo' (indian sweet).
Right, brother?
Yes. 'ladoos'.
We will distribute 'ladoo'.
We will distribute 'ladoos'.
Yes, they are round as well.
The world is also round.
Should we distribute that?
- No, no, no.
What kind of people there are in the world, uncle.
Of different types.
They neither pray in the morning nor go to work.
Yes.
- True, dear.
There are such people as well.
What times have come!
There's a demon staying in a god's house.
I'll have to use my demonic mind.
Uncle.
- What happened?
What happened?
What happened?
- Nothing.
It's a small injury.
Should i seek revenge?
Here you go.
Mother earth.
Bad mummy.
Bad mummy, mother earth.
- Sorry, uncle.
He was trying to make me fall but you fell instead.
But why was he trying to make you fall?
Anger.
I said a few true things and he got angry.
He got irritated.
Why get irritated with it?
She is telling the truth.
He is always either on his bike or his skates.
Otherwise he keeps building his body in the spare time.
Why are you ruining my healthy body?
Everyone is saying something or the other don't you have to say something?
God sent him here to increase the burden on earth.
You are telling the truth for the first time.
We have been given a life only so that he can disgrace us.
Absolutely right.
- He is a big disgrace.
You have a great sense of honour, uncle.
Even a satan will look like a god in front of him.
Great.
- Wonderful.
He is... - i think i'll have to tell aunt about your affair, uncle.
I'm not saying it from my heart.
Don't take it to your heart.
My hand broke.
- Be careful.
Be careful.
Be careful.
Take me to a hospital.
- We'll have to do something about her.
She's digging a grave for you.
What happened?
- I cannot move it.
I'll handle her.
Because uncle, once she is gone, life is fun.
Great, pooja.
Great.
- Enough.
It is delicious.
- Fantastic.
- She cooks so well. - yes.
Outstanding.
Outstanding.
Yes.
- And she sings so well. - yes.
And she is also changing our spoilt brat for good.
- Yes.
Look, he is here.
Son, your name is prem (love) And not 'hatred'.
Right?
- Really?
Hey, listen.
Hello.
- Sit.
Madam, go.
Go to the airport.
Come on.
Why?
- Your father has sent a parcel for you.
From usa.
- Yes, so why are you giving me the news?
You should have collected it for me.
He is useless.
You sing so well.
You cook so well.
What would have happened if you had studied a little as well?
The officer there won't give the parcel to me without your signature.
You only will have to go there.
How will the poor girl go to airport alone?
You go with her, prem.
Am i her driver, chauffer or servant?
Brother.
- Prem, you go with her.
Daddy, you are very that.
- I am very boring.
But still, you will go.
Go, dear.
Go.
Yes, but dad didn't inform me over the phone.
Oh, fax.
- What?
He has sent a fax, you dirty mind.
Why are you wasting time talking, prem?
The parcel will go back.
Come on, leave.
Go.
Please go, son.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Be careful.
I think he's up to something.
I have a mobile.
I'll call if anything happens.
Only if he will let you call.
'I could've easily spent 10-12 days in this house... ' '... if he wouldn't have been born here.'
'She has made my family crazy about her in two days.'
'I would be dead if she would stay for 12 days.'
'He cannot stop taking advantage.'
'We take advantage of those we would gain something from.'
'I am just trying to get rid of her.'
'Airport is on the left and he is taking a right turn.'
'Is he planning to take me to the jungle and... ' 'no, madam.
If i do any such thing... ' '... then i'll get stuck with you forever.'
'Then i will have to marry you.'
'Then why is he taking me to a jungle?
'
'Will he leave me amidst wild animals?
'
'I would have if i wasn't so concerned about the poor animals.'
'I think i'll have to show her a few lions.'
How can you even think of such a thing?
What are you doing?
Where are the keys?
- I threw it.
The steering wheel got locked.
Why did you throw it?
Are you a woman or what?
I'm a woman.
- If you are a woman then you should have kept the keys here, like a woman.
Keys are not kept there.
Keys are kept around the waist.
To hell with your 26" waist.
I can see a six and a half foot grave there.
Move the steering wheel.
No, steering wheel has failed.
The steering wheel has failed.
Your mind has failed.
But the brakes didn't fail, right?
- No, they didn't.
Prem.
- She's gone. - prem.
Prem.
Prem.
Prem.
Where are you?
- I am here.
Down here.
She was hanging me, now god has hanged her.
Are you dead or alive?
I'm still alive, but i can die anytime.
Help me.
- Okay.
Take this.
Take my hand.
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come closer first.
No, i am thinking that it's better if one person dies rather than two.
Coward.
Dastard.
Pansy.
Chicken.
Should i come there to help you so that you can help me?
Let me ask help for myself first.
Hurry up.
- Help me, god.
Give me your leg.
- You are already hanging.
How else should i hang you?
I mean give me your leg.
Leg?
Man and woman look good in pair.
But to touch something with ones' leg is a grave sin.
You are hanging on the branch with both your hands.
How will you save me?
Ma'am, each hand of mine has 2 times a gorilla's strength.
Depending on age and size.
By the way, i can save you with one hand.
Then useless, use that hand.
Hold my waist and pull me.
No, no, no.
Not the waist.
Then you will say that i took advantage.
What?
- By the way your waist is... let my waist go to hell.
Hold whatever you want.
Do whatever you want.
But please save me.
In that case, come to me, my suitcase.
Look madam, you are taking advantage of my disadvantage.
- What?
If you come any closer, then i swear i'll let go of both the hands and embrace you.
And both of us will be dead.
Please save me.
Let's go.
What are you doing?
Just hanging around.
Don't worry.
You women are amazing.
You cannot stick on to anything other than your age.
Sometimes you say take the advantage sometimes you say don't take advantage.
What nonsense is this?
All your yakking is making me go crazy.
It was the demand of the situation.
I wasn't wrong to touch you now.
I was wrong to touch you earlier.
If this is not wrong then why is that wrong?
And if that is wrong then why isn't this wrong?
Actually, you are wrong.
It is wrong to sit here and talk to you.
It's of no use.
I'll lie down.
Obviously it's of no use.
I'm sitting and you are lying down.
It would've benefited if either, both of us were sitting or lying down.
Look, don't say double meaning things to me.
This is a limit to illiteracy.
Where is a double meaning in it?
Look, don't turn and sleep like this.
I feel something inside.
By the way, the jean fits well on your waist.
My ill-fate i wish he wasn't a man.
And you weren't a woman.
Sanjana singh.
Pooja has horns.
Prem!
'Prem.
Prem.
Prem.'
Isn't it a great place?
You call out once and it echoes back a number of times.
You have brought me here to hear this?
Oh, no.
This is nothing.
Now i'll shout your name and see what name echoes back.
Should i?
Sanjana!
'Sanjana.
Sanjana.
Sanjana.'
Hear it.
'Sanjana.
Sanjana.
Sanjana.'
I'm saying pooja and it is echoing back as sanjana.
Isn't it a strange place?
Look, the valley is so deep.
Prem.
- Only echoes come back from here, not people.
Tell me the truth.
Who are you?
Otherwise, i'll let go of you.
I'll tell you the truth.
Pull be back first.
Come on, start your story.
You already know my real name.
Sanjana singh.
Actually, i had come from america to get married.
But the guy i was going to get married to turned out to be a famous don's son.
I ran away from the wedding but they snatched my passport.
It takes at least 10-12 days to make a new passport.
I needed a place to hide as well.
Then i saw you at the airport.
You had come to pick up pooja and no one knew pooja.
So i thought... you know the rest.
- I know the rest.
What did you do with the real pooja?
I hope you didn't murder her.
No.
She has gone to attend her friend's wedding, in phuket.
She will go to guru's ashram from there.
Guru.
Guru.
Guru.
He is a... let's go.
Prem.
Hey, move aside.
"My heart broke."
"My heart broke."
"My heart went crazy."
I think you want me to give you a lift.
You are very handsome and dashing brother.
- Brother?
This car won't go anywhere.
It has broken-down.
Why?
What happened, darling?
Darling?
- The car will run.
It will get repaired.
I'm a mechanic.
It's my job.
Hope in.
Yes.
- But you didn't ask me where you should drop me.
I haven't caught you as yet, to drop you.
First let me introduce myself.
I'm mr.
Lehri.
I'm sure you know bhappi lehri.
There is no connection between us.
Yes, there is a connection.
He likes gold and i like to sleep.
Hello.
Why are you whistling?
You've already won over me.
Are you from pataya?
Who is he?
Is he your boyfriend?
No, he is a distant friend.
- A distant friend?
Just like a distant relative.
Okay.
Then i have no problem because i am shortsighted.
So shall we leave, mr.
Weak?
Hello.
I keep a person like you as my driver.
Really?
- Yes.
- Then give me the keys.
Come on.
The key is in its place.
I got a driver.
Come on, darling.
Come behind.
Come on.
Come on.
Watch your feet.
You aren't in the mood to come behind?
Not a problem.
We'll talk from here.
Great.
It's such a young and beautiful weather.
When i look at you i remember a romantic phrase.
Tell me.
Mingle in jungle.
I, too, remember a phrase when i see you.
A.k. Hangal in the jungle.
You know liquor and beauty have a deep connection?
I'm often intoxicated and the evening passes away.
There will be a day when the evening will be intoxicated and you will pass away.
Hello.
I'm not here to get insulted.
Where do you usually go to get insulted?
Where will i go?
I stay at home.
I'm married.
You give a lift to a single girl even when you are married?
Who doesn't?
I only give, you take it as well, forcefully.
Watch out!
What is he doing up there?
Plucking fruits.
He plucked a lot of fruits.
Oh no!
- What have you done?
I didn't do it.
You did it.
Hard work paid off, didn't it?
You were driving very passionately.
Whose car is this?
- This is my car.
It's not a car.
It is my wife.
I love it.
If your wife has an affair with someone then who will work hard on her?
Her lover, who else?
Who will enjoy it?
- My wife, who else?
Who will get punished?
- Me, who else?
So just imagine.
She is your wife.
Who was working hard on her?
- You.
Who was enjoying it?
- She was.
Who will get punished?
Me, who else?
Because it was my car.
Don't cry, my son.
Be strong.
The lord works in mysterious ways, my son.
Have this fruit.
You are a father?
Father.
Father, i had bad thoughts about her.
Father, i'm a sinner.
I've committed a grave sin, father.
I am a sinner.
Hey!
Stop the car.
There's the girl.
What have i done!
- Prem, let's go.
They are his men.
Come.
- Come on.
Come on.
Fast.
Or she'll escape.
- I want to confess.
Where is that girl?
- Which girl?
The one who was standing here with you.
Your sister.
She... sister?
I think she ran away with brother-in-law.
Listen, have you seen our boss?
Who is your boss?
- Tall, board, huge man.
Okay, this... what are you asking?
I'm selling these fruits here.
The fruits of hard work.
These fruits are very tasty.
Just taste them.
No.
I didn't.
My car hit him.
Get him.
- My car hit him.
Mr. Chaudhary, your son has gone into coma because of excess blood loss.
I don't know when he will regain consciousness.
Quickly resuscitate him, doctor otherwise, i will sent you into coma.
Send me as well, sir.
To my home, sir.
Look, sir, it was my car but your son was hit by that boy.
I don't even now how to drive a car.
I swear on him.
Let him go.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
So sweet.
Yes.
Sir, i am leaving but before leaving i would like to give you a small warning.
Sir, that boy is very smart.
He is fast, in driving cars and using his brain as well.
If he will come before you he will do such actions that you will forget to give reactions.
Has anyone seen that boy?
Has anyone seen that boy?
I've only seen him from the left side.
And i've only seen him from the right side.
Sir, what is this left and right.
I've seen him from centre.
Will you be able to recognize him?
You are talking about recognizing?
Actually, i was born when i was small.
My mother was a woman.
And the person who murdered my father underwent plastic surgery thrice.
Yet i recognized him.
Because he used to come to our shop to buy the plastic.
From now onwards, this plastic will always be with us.
Take him away.
- No.
This is wrong.
Shut up.
- This is wrong.
Find that boy and sanjana.
Wherever they are hiding find them.
What?
- What kind of childishness is this, pooja?
Is this a way to behave?
Does anyone hold and push anyone like this?
How was that?
- What did you do?
Like this...
like this... what did you do?
- What did i do?
You held her like this and pushed her like this.
The push she got had that.
The push she got had minimal effect?
- Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
Take your position.
- From there.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Come, come, one by one.
- Come on.
Come on.
Talk to your darling nephew.
- Yes.
From the time they have returned from the jungle there is a lot of fun happening around.
"It is fun.
It is fun.
It is fun."
"It is fun.
It is fun.
It is fun."
Excuse me.
Just friends.
- Play the wedding tune.
Just friends.
Prem!
Prem, your method was wrong but your intentions were good.
Now i have no complaints against you.
- Mr. Pathak.
No.
No.
No.
My khushi is so happy with raju that i forgot all my sorrows.
Great.
Great.
Great.
- That's great.
You know i'm going to london.
Raju sent the tickets.
- Of economic class?
Yes.
- Yes.
How do you know that?
- Because i gave raju the idea.
I told him not to buy first class tickets as you are such a miser that you will be happy even with economic class ticket.
What happened?
- It got wet. - what?
What is this, daddy?
You always say double meaning things.
There is no double meaning in it.
The thing which we talk.
With which... mobile.
Mobile.
Mobile.
- Mobile?
My purse.
- My money.
My purse.
Your underwear.
Let's get out of this.
Today, i got that and after a long time that happened.
You got wet and fell in love?
No, i caught cold.
Today, the sunday truly feels like a sunday.
A sunday will always be a sunday.
- Yes.
We never go in the swimming pool together even if we want to, right?
Really.
- Thank you, pooja. - you're welcome.
Welcome.
Thank you.
I am ready.
But there is a no entry here.
Someone stop me.
Sir.
Ajunior priest has come from guru's place.
He is here?
- Yes.
Make him comfortable...
- yes.
The junior priest is here.
I'll go meet him and welcome him.
My wallet... from the drawer... that one.
Yes.
And the wallet... priest, why are you here?
I mean what brings you here?
I'll tell that later, but guru is very angry with you.
Why?
- Why didn't you go to pick up pooja from the airport?
I had gone there but i got a little late.
She left to attend the wedding.
Yes, she will be going to the ashram directly from the wedding.
Be there on time to pick her up.
- As you say.
Where is everyone else?
- They are with pooja... but pooja is... - not this one, the pooja which was sent last month.
We sent a dog last month...
- don't call her a dog.
The family members have named her pooja.
They have named her pooja?
A dog...
- again you are calling her a dog.
Doggie, dog, puppy, pup, raju, tommy.
Nothing.
Call her pooja.
Otherwise with a broom... they are so madly in love with her that nowadays we eat dog food... dog... oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Pooja's food.
Pedigree and white kennel.
So what should i call her?
Pooja?
Don't call her that if you want to lose your loincloth and your honour.
Hello, priest.
They are here to serve you.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Bless you.
Bless you.
Guru had kept a 'satyanarayan' ritual... - very good.
He has sent the offering of that.
Sanjana... as soon as they call for pooja you come with the dog.
Tell me, where is pooja.
She is here.
Pooja.
Now what do i tell you, priest.
We have got very attached to pooja in such a short span.
She is so sweet that as soon as she came, prem... she won everyone's heart.
'Oh god, what magic has this dog done in one month?
'
Our pooja is as decent as she is beautiful.
'A decent dog?
'
'Have they lost their mind?
'
She is now our family member.
Does she bite?
What kind of a joke is that?
Is she a suckling that she will bite?
She is of marriageable age.
It's a different thing if she starts biting after marriage.
Whether she bites, scratches or does anything else we have decided that she'll be the daughter-in-law of our family.
'They will make a dog their daughter-in-law?
'
'A dog will be perfect for you, son.'
'You deserve this.'
What are you thinking about?
That is happening with guru's permission.
'Dandiya', 'garba' (gujarati dance forms).
No, no, no.
That... that... that... yes.
The alliance.
- The alliance.
The alliance.
'I think they have gone absolutely crazy.'
'They didn't go to pick up the pooja guru had sent... ' '... from the airport.'
'They have named their dog pooja... ' '... and they are getting him married to her.'
'I'll also go crazy if i stay here any longer.'
I'll make a move.
Have lunch before you leave.
- Yes.
Pooja's favourite dishes have been made today.
'Oh, god.
They are feeding dog food to a priest?
'
Look, i... you can have it.
I'm fasting today.
I'll make a move.
- Bye.
- Okay, priest. - okay, priest.
Who is this girl?
You don't recognize her?
You are strange.
She is our maid.
You had brought her here from the ashram.
'Look at that.
These lunatics think i am crazy.'
'I hope i really don't go crazy.'
Excuse me.
I'll make a move.
Okay.
- Okay.

Maids.
- Yes, brother.
Where is everybody gone?
Brother... gone ashram.
Meeting guru.
And pooja?
- Gone... with them too.
Why, brother?
Heart beating fasting?
Brother, where are you running?
Come on, come on.
- Come.
This is guru's that.
What is it called... as... ashram.
We've come here to fix a wedding date for your marriage with prem.
Yes.
Let's go.
You go ahead.
We'll come.
- Okay.
Pooja, it is believed that all wishes...
Come.
Which pooja are you talking about, ram?
Pooja has not returned from her friend's wedding.
Then who is the one who has been staying in our house as pooja since the past few days.
Who is the scoundrel you ran away with?
Kill his entire family.
How is that possible!
You want me, right?
I'm ready to come with you.
Let's go.
Come on.
Leave me.
Brother-in-law.
Sanjana is not here.
I knew that you would surely come.
And i, too, knew that you would say "i knew that you would surely come."
Why should i come, huh?
Am i your boyfriend?
I love you?
- Saw?
You are agreeing to it.
No.
Really?
He's your uncle?
Yes.
Prem, how would i tell you that these goons, mafias are my maternal uncles?
Great.
Your family members are like charles shobraj and ranja billa?
I love these mafia people.
Stop joking, prem.
You don't know how much my uncles hate each other my mother's last wish was that i get both my uncles' blessings at my wedding.
So that their enmity ends forever and they become good human beings like they were, earlier.
But?
- The greed of attaining my property worth 200 crores increased their enmity.
Each one of them wants me to marry his brother-in-law.
200 crores?
I can draw a cheque without deducting the tds and keep your uncles in my pocket.
But my dear, until there are obstacles in a love story it is not called a love story.
What stories will we tell our children?
Look, a boyfriend gets scared of his girlfriend.
A girlfriend gets scared of a cockroach.
A cockroach gets scared of a mouse.
A mouse gets scared of a cat.
A cat gets scared of a dog.
And a dog gets scared of a man.
- And a man is scared of a woman.
- What?
Just like a villain...
gets scared of the hero.
Prem, let's go.
My uncle is here.
What now?
They will...
- don't worry, dear.
Today, i'll predict your future.
You will get married to an innocent looking rogue.
That's me.
Now can i take some advantage?
By the way, the fitting of the indian dress is very good.
"Ready... i am ready for you.
Are you ready for me?"
"Are you ready for me?
Are you ready for me?"
"Are you ready for me?
I am ready for you."
Uncle, yuvraj was forcefully... i ran away from there.
Sit in the car.
They are drying out.
This boy is making me that.
That... irritate?
- No, not irritate.
That... this... this... emotional?
- Emotional is like this.
This... - so?
He is making me this.
This.
This... crazy.
- Crazy. - crazy.
He is making crazy.
Crazy.
Crazy.
He lied to me.
That girl is not this but that.
What...
- not sanjana, pooja.
Pooja.
Yes.
Yes.
What you are thinking of doing is not so easy.
They are dangerous.
- Yes.
They are dons.
I would've said the same had i been in your place.
But... what would've you done had you been in my place?
Why don't you make him understand?
What should i tell him?
All i know is that sanjana is a very nice girl.
And right now, she must be in trouble.
She must be in big trouble.
That's true, sister-in-law.
But there is no solution to this problem.
I have such a solution that i'll make the lives of both the dons, hell.
They have a common ca, who has done ba.
And his name... what was his name?
Sounds like bully.
- Idli (a south indian snack)?
Mulli (raddish)?
Pulley.
- Talli (drunk)?
No, close.
Close.
Khuli (open)?
Khali?
Khali.
Balli.
Balidaan bhardwaj.
Sakku, how many times will you call me?
I feel that you call me even when you dial a wrong number.
What do i do?
You have left the house with so much cash.
I'm feeling scared.
This isn't the first time i'm out with so much cash.
I do transactions worth millions, day and night.
All 500 and 1000 denomination bills across the world knows balidaan bhardwaj.
Then?
- That's fine.
But what if a thief stabs you and robs you?
Sakku, are you concerned about me or are you trying to kill me?
Hang up, sakku.
I want two demands drafts made.
One of30 lakhs and the other of20 lakhs.
Take this.
My bag?
My bag!
Where did my bag go?
Where is my bag?
There was 50 lakhs in the bag.
Where did the bag go?
My bag.
My bag got stolen.
Have you seen a thief here?
- No.
You blind man, you didn't see the thief?
You didn't even see such a big bag?
I didn't see it.
I'm not the owner of it.
You... have you seen your face?
It's so black that if shown on national television it will ward off evil from the entire country.
Sakku, what you said came true.
Sakku.
What happened?
Amar chaudhary and suraj chaudhary's 50 lakhs got stolen.
What?
Don't do this.
Pack the bags.
It's time to leave the city.
Come on.
- Yes.
They are here.
Tell them i am not here.
I'll go and hide myself.
Mr. Bhardwaj.
Mr. Bhardwaj.
He has not only left this house but this world as well.
A trunk ran over him.
- Oh, no.
He got crushed.
Do you have anyone to look after you in this cruel world?
No.
By the way, i had brought this bag for him.
What will i do of this briefcase when he is no more?
Don't worry.
I'll take care of both his belongings.
Okay?
Let's meet after his final rites.
Bring it here.
Where are you going?
You are alive, sir?
- Yes, i'm alive.
It's her hobby.
She kills her husband over everything.
Start wearing a wedding chain from tomorrow.
People get mistaken.
She is mine.
And... this bag is also mine.
There are only 50 lakhs in it, right, sir?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
There are only 50 lakhs... just a minute.
How did you come to know that there are 50 lakhs in it?
Just be looking at the bundle of the notes i can predict how many notes it contains.
How?
- I learnt this art from my master.
Mr. B. B., sir.
Bishan singh bedi?
- No, sir.
Then?
Balibhrambhat.
- No, no, sir.
Bichun bhutia.
Goal.
No way, sir.
The one who has written this book.
Mr. Balidaan bhardwaj.
Be careful, sir.
I've written a book?
When did i write this book?
Such a fat book?
You?
- Yes.
Look at this.
The balidaan in front of bhardwaj is me.
That's me.
This is a sign of a genius.
You wrote a book and you don't even remember.
Sir, this book is a missile and you are an example for a newcomer like me.
I have come to this city to be your assistant, sir.
I see.
- I want to learn the ropes of this job with you.
I don't want any money either.
- Then my job is done.
I mean your job is done.
- Thank you, sir.
I have only two clients.
Amar chaudhary and suraj chaudhary.
Sir, they are mafias.
One is a mongoose.
And the other one is a snake.
If they get together then they are killer sharks.
But both of them are illiterates.
How many times during a year do you think people like chaudhary must be paying their taxes?
Sir, they must not even be paying the taxi fare.
Sir... i make them pay tax every month.
Every month?
Again and again.
- Again and again.
12 times.
- 12 times.
Yes.
What do i do?
It is dirty but it is my business.
It is your business.
This is the only way to teach a lesson to those goons.
Sir, your name is balidaan but you are making your clients sacrifice.
Now that you have joined me everyone will be sacrificed...
with prem (love).
Come with us.
Come with us.
- Why are you hitting me?
Come with us.
Come with us.
- Why are you hitting me?
Hit him.
Stop.
Stop.
Don't hit me.
Stop.
Stop.
I am your teacher, amar chaudhary.
Teacher?
You are a cheater, you scoundrel.
You give me a zero in the exams.
You gave the wrong answer.
What was the question?
Who is the president of india?
- Mrs. Prathiba patil.
You had said that it was abdul kallam.
The president got changed.
It is my fault that the president got changed?
What do i have to do with when and where alexander fought porus?
Do i have to go there and dig their graves?
Hit him.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Well done.
You are doing well, amar chaudhary.
Saw that?
That's why i named him after me.
Amar chaudhary.
Hey, amar chaudhary!
You stinky insect of a dirty sewer?
Mother, you go inside.
- Stop barking, you dog.
And let him go.
Otherwise i'll poison your food and feed you.
Got it?
Hey, go.
Take him back with dignity.
Go.
Yes.
- Go.
Let's go, sir.
Grandpa, you are being abused under his pretext.
No, no.
It's not so.
You are like a father to my daughter-in-law.
You are god.
A born leech.
- What?
He is.
This amar chaudhary.
It's time for school.
Don't you have to go?
Father, should i get something for you?
Yes, daughter-in-law.
Get some tea for me.
Okay.
- Without sugar.
And without poison.
Have some sweets, mr.
Chaudhary.
I got the land for your liquor factory cleared.
And it hardly cost you anything.
Only 50 lakhs.
Balli.
- Yes.
Don't you know you cannot bring strangers in here?
Who is he?
- He's my nephew.
Nephew?
- Yes, look.
We look similar, don't we?
You mean when i am of your age i will look like you?
Forget about the face, mr.
Chaudhary.
Talk about brains.
He is from america.
He will show your income so less that you won't need to pay tax.
- Really?
You know the billionaire in america?
K.k. Modi.
He used to handle his account.
K. K. Modi?
- K. K. Modi?
Forget it.
Forget k.
K. Modi.
Now that you are here you work for mr.
Chaudhary.
Handle his account.
Hire you nephew.
- Nephew!
Grandpa, it sounds like your business.
Ganja.
Balli.
- Yes?
You didn't teach your nephew how to salute?
Salute me.
What to get thrashed?
What did you say?
- No.
I saw my horoscope in the morning.
Yes.
- In it it's written that if i salute anyone younger than me today then he will get thrashed all day long.
But still if you want...
- no, no.
Let it be.
But i have read his horoscope.
Balli.
Come on.
- Let it be, today.
My nephew is with me.
So... balli.
Yes.
Now my hands feel warmer.
The apple of my eye.
My brave boy.
- Wild hippo, amar chaudhary.
Write 'welcome' on your face.
You will look like a rotten doormat.
Anyway, your ponytail looks like a dead dog's tail.
Look at your grandpa.
It suits him so well.
Take this.
Stupid.
Go to school.
Yes, grandpa.
This is the first time mother has said the right thing.
The girls in my class tease me.
They said it looks like theirs.
With your permission can i chop it off?
Amar chaudhary, you can have your neck cut but not your ponytail.
This is a warning, not advice.
We are samurais.
This is the identity of our family.
Your i.d. Proof.
It is a voter's card, pan card.
Your blood group.
A proof that you are his grandson and he is your grandpa.
Where did this boring old man come from?
Great grandpa.
I saw you.
Today my day will go well.
Concentrate on your studies.
Kids of your age have gone places.
People of your age as well have gone places.
"Happy days are over."
"Now i'm surrounded with sadness."
What is this, mr.
Lehri?
What are you doing?
I'm having black coffee with obama in the white house.
Can't you see?
I hit the brakes to give you a lift.
Now my shirt has turned into a mop.
All this happened because of me, right?
I'm feeling very guilty.
I love you too.
Now it is my duty to get you out of here.
I also want to leave.
Because if my children grow up they won't recognize me.
And my wife is so nave that the poor thing might once again run away with someone.
No such thing will happen because i have a mind-blowing idea.
This is the boy with whom sanjana ran away, sir.
He doesn't look like he is from our city.
I'll find him even if he is hiding underground.
Are you telling the truth?
Sir, if i am lying he should die immediately.
No, i take his oath and say that henceforth that that boy was not him but someone else.
Sir.
- What happened?
Sir, someone has come to meet you.
Balli, you got the land cleared for amar for his liquor factory?
I just got the land cleared for him.
But for you along with the land i also got the license for the liquor factory cleared.
Lehri, go.
You are free to go.
Mr. Chaudhary, i am leaving but before leaving i would like to give you a warning.
Sir, this boy is very smart.
Only i know how he traps people.
You won't be able to anything to him even if he comes and stands before you.
You do one thing.
You keep cleaning cars here till sanjana's marriage.
Sir, what are you saying?
Sir, this is a crime.
It's a sin.
Mr. Chaudhary, you cannot do this.
Mr. Chaudhary can do anything.
He is justice chaudhary.
He provides justice to good people.
And he clears out the bad people.
Pick him and throw him out.
Balli, who is this boy?
He is a con.
C-o-n.
Con.
He joined hands with that girl and fooled me.
Which animal have i left out?
- You dog, clean the car.
Mr. Chaudhary, isn't the boy useful?
Once i start working, there will be no income and no tax.
No income tax.
But balli, how is this possible?
This boy will work for amar as well as us.
He has a habit of doing two things together.
You know k.k. Modi in america?
He used to also handle his younger brother s.k. Modi's account.
But what if he turns out to be bad?
Then you can behead my uncle.
Behead me?
- Saw?
He agrees to it.
The thumb impression on the file.
Take it.
Just a minute.
Uncle, i was casually checking your accounts.
There are a lot of discrepancies.
What?
- There must be a slight difference.
21.
- 21... balli.
There is a difference of rs.21.
Rs.21, dear?
It's hardly a difference.
Just a minute, uncle.
You are his assistant, right?
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on, show me the accounts.
Uncle, i'll go and check the accounts properly.
Yes, yes.
Okay, dear.
Hey... persuade her.
- Consider it done.
Balli, you saw how my niece's education is benefiting me?
Prem, this is not the right situation to take advantage.
Really?
Then promise me that you will meet me tonight.
And you will let me take all the advantages.
- Prem.
You... you okay?
- Yes.
I was justjoking.
Balli, why do you look as if you've seen a ghost?
Our future daughter-in-law is checking everything, right?
Yes.
In detail.
Come with me.
Come with me.
Let them work.
Saw that?
My future wife is no ordinary girl.
Yes, i just came to know.
She has taken after me deceased sister.
So, your sister was also like her?
Then the entire family... what happened?
He is getting scared.
- He fears he might get caught.
Sanjana... sanjana is not my daughter.
She is more than a daughter to me, prem.
Her happiness means everything to me.
But... but you don't know her uncles.
They...
- i know.
They are rogues from the neanderthal times.
Orthodox.
I am a modern age dog.
Latest.
When we will fight, i will eat them up.
"I am a dog and she is my partner."
"I tell the truth, when she came..."
"...there came a season to eat everyone up."
Stop it.
Look, aunt, everything will be fine.
I promise.
What were you doing inside?
All that cuddling and all?
Uncle, she fell over me.
Girls from affluent families... hello.
Girls from affluent families are like that.
Try to understand.
Whether she falls on you or you fall on her our necks will get cut and fall down.
Uncle, you only asked me to persuade her.
I got persuaded.
You would've got exposed if she would've opened the accounts.
This is the first time i have let a girl touch me and you... no, no.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
You are my disciple.
Come on, get in.
Get in.
Let's go.
Let's go.
"In 12 months i'll express my love to you in 12 different ways."
"Now i think i won't be able to survive..."
"...even for 12 minutes without you."
"When the winter season starts in january."
"We will switch on the heater of love."
"In a blanket as small as february..."
"...we will play hide and seek."
"March will be a romantic month."
"We'll do something we have never done before."
"What if we aren't able to meet in april?"
"What will happen?
Find a solution."
"I'll get an internet connection so that i can chat with you."
"When the summer season starts in may..."
"...we will party at the poolside."
"We will take a long vacation in june."
"We will go to a hill station."
"When starts raining in july..."
"...i'll yearn to embrace you."
"We will have a lot of fun in august."
"We will make some arrangements."
"I'll take you to london.
I'll give you a tour of paris."
"I'll take you on a world tour."
"I feel that i'll be coming often to your house in september."
"We'll see the sunsets together in october."
"You can keep your head on my shoulders."
"By the time the wretch november comes..."
"...you would've already surrendered your heart."
"Things will get confirmed on 12th december."
"With the confirmation from our hearts."
"There will be no car or mare."
"I'll bring the wedding procession on foot."
"In 12 months i'll express my love to you in 12 different ways."
"Now i think i won't be able to survive..."
"...even for 12 minutes without you."
Prem hasn't come as yet, dear.
Don't worry, aunt.
He will surely come.
Why don't you go and pay your respects as you have come to the temple, junior chaudhary?
Tell me.
I prayed for a week before my exams.
He failed me.
- Then why have you come here?
I'm my grandpa's junior spy.
Whenever any female in the family goes out of the house i keep an eye on them.
Whether they are going and meeting our enemies.
Aunt.
Go.
My child.
Bless you.
- That's enough.
Bless you.
Sister.
Someone stop them.
You are crying?
They are bound to cry.
These sisters-in-law love each other more than their own sister.
In spite of living in the same city we have met after ages.
Our men our fighting and we women are suffering.
I wonder when this will end.
Like i have united the aunts i will unite the uncles as well.
If i don't turn this family into a 'hum aapke hain kyon' family then don't call me prem.
Thank you.
Okay, so you are befriending our enemies in the pretext of praying and worshiping?
Son, she isn't an enemy.
She is your grandaunt.
Amar, my child.
- Don't touch me, you old woman.
Scoundrel, if you say a word more i'll feed you kerosene and light a match in front of your mouth.
Get out of here.
Forgive him, sister.
His grandfather has made him just like him.
I wonder when he will mend his ways.
Why are you laughing?
He will change, but i'm laughing thinking of the way in which he will change.
Junior chaudhary, the park is closed.
It's closed for others, not me.
Go and tell the manager, amar chaudhary is here.
The park will remain open.
Okay, sir.
- Okay, sir.
Come here, you animal.
Salute me.
The park should be closed now.
We have to go home.
You are refusing amar chaudhary?
Come here.
How dare you!
I won't spare you.
Go.
Who... who are you?
Badman.
Badman?
- Yes.
I'm here to turn a bad boy like you into a good boy.
You... one kick and from badman you will become a dead man.
Kick me.
Kick me.
Kick me.
Really?
Here you go.
Darn him.
I am sorry, bad-man.
Spare me.
Forgive me.
Okay.
From today, you'll be a good boy.
Yes, i will.
You won't bunk school.
- Okay.
You won't trouble your teachers.
You'll always respect your elders.
And you will cut your ponytail as well.
- Yes.
No, no.
This is not possible.
It is the identity of my family.
Shut up.
The kid has tired me.
First try to talk things out.
If they don't understand then kick them.
Great, balli.
Great.
Your nephew is one in a million.
Amar chaudhary.
Why do you have bandana on your head?
It's the latest fashion, grandpa.
Okay.
Okay.
Fashion.
Come here, my tiger.
And hit on this jackal's head.
Bless me, uncle balli.
What are you doing?
Respecting my elders, grandfather.
This is what badman has taught us.
Who badman?
- He is our new teacher, grandpa.
Teacher?
Grandpa, his new teacher is prem.
Dear, now i feel he'll also bring my two scoundrels back on track.
Hello uncle, uncle suraj is once again trying to get me married to veer.
What?
- Yes.
But i want to marry your son, yuvraj.
Yuvraj?
- Please, uncle.
Please, do something.
Please, quickly get me out of here.
Someone is coming.
Come on, get the cars out.
Load your guns.
Let there be bloodshed?
We will have to bring sanjana at any cost by this evening.
What are you doing, chaudhary... sir.
Uncle, tell them.
What you are doing is wrong.
You are going to kill your brother for 200 crores?
Whereas someone worth 500 crores is in uncle's pocket.
Who are you talking about?
Uncle, i'm talking about k.
K modi.
Yes.
K.k. Modi from america.
Tell them how much he is worth.
He is worth 5000-7000 crores.
And hear this.
You know who has been given the responsibility of getting his daughter naina married?
Uncle.
Uncle, you couldn't see this gem of a person?
Whereas naina desires a gem of a person.
They are such lovely people.
They are romantic.
They are going to kill their brothers.
Uncle, if i wouldn't have thought of this then there would've been a bloodshed today.
Why don't you think?
No, the idea was on the way in my mind but because of traffic... get this straight, balli.
If we don't get this alliance then consider yourself death.
Get out of here.
I took k.k. Modi's name just like that.
You added his daughter to the story.
You added the responsibility of her marriage.
You added all the spices.
Sir, you told me all this...
after having a few drinks.
I told you about people who don't exist?
They exist, sir.
Listen.
- Yes?
Some k.k. Modi has called five times since morning.
He told me to remind you that he is coming to india on friday to discuss his daughter's wedding.
And yes, he has asked to book some resort.
Don't forget.
How is this possible?
Sir, this means you either have mp or up.
Madhya pradesh and uttar pradesh?
Mp means memory power.
- Okay.
Sir, in this illness the battery of memory conks off.
Or up that is unbelievable power.
Unbelievable power.
- Yes, sir.
In this the characters you think about come in real life.
I don't believe this.
That's why it is called unbelievable power.
Now you have to decide whether it's your effective thinking or defective disease.
Meanwhile, sir, you have thrown me out of the house.
Bye.
Taxi!
- No, prem.
I said that as i was worried.
Please.
Okay.
- Don't leave me in such confusion.
Okay, sir.
Tell me what i should do next.
There is no option or resort to this.
Yes, the last resort is that you book a resort.
Okay.
They have come?
Limo.
Ballu.
Ballu.
Uncle, go and welcome modi.
What a pleasant surprise.
Come here.
Come here.
Give your friend a hug.
You have become fit.
I think it is the result of sister-in-law shakuntala's that.
Love.
- Her love.
How is sister-in-law sakku?
I hope you didn't have any that on the way.
What is it... no, no.
One has to take some that for one's child.
Some... trouble.
- Yes, trouble.
Let's go.
Mr. Modi.
- Mr. Modi.
Stop.
Is this a way to ask for donations?
Mr. Modi, he is mr.
Chaudhary.
Avery famous I in the city.
- Landlord?
- landlord. - landlord.
Mr. Modi, welcome, welcome, welcome.
Welcome.
Uncle modi.
Aunt modi.
Balli works for us.
Okay, balli knows you.
That means he is our that... guest.
- Guest.
Guest.
Call him tonight for...
- drinks?
Dinner.
Dinner.
And that as well.
Let's go.
Why are you staring at them with your mouth open?
Have you seen them for the first time?
Anyone will give that reaction on seeing mr.
Modi.
Sir, if you are a mouse then he is a cat.
If you are a cat, he is a dog.
If you are a dog, he is a fox.
If you are a fox then he is a lion.
If you are lion then he is an elephant.
If you are an elephant then he is a dinosaur.
Dinosaur of business, sir.
For your own good, come on time for dinner.
Otherwise you are a donkey, sir.
Who is going anywhere?
I am here till night.
Yes.
- Yes.
Let's go.
What happened, uncle?
He met me with so much affection.
He gave me a hug as well.
But i couldn't recognize him.
Is it an illness or my imagination?
Both.
- Both?
One personality is ill.
It is the imagination of the other personality.
The first and the second personality clashed with each other and resulted in the third personality.
Spilt personality.
The fourth personality will be suicidal personality.
You will feel like committing suicide, uncle.
You are right.
- No.
I feel like committing suicide.
- No.
Yes.
- Don't do it, uncle. - why?
You won't remember that you have committed suicide, uncle.
So what should i do?
Uncle, now you have only one option left.
What?
- Believe that your personality with imagination is right.
You know him.
He is k.k. Modi.
- You recognize him.
I'll have to.
Otherwise, i'll commit suicide and i won't even remember it.
So what's the use?
He is k.k. Modi.
Mr. Modi, we are not as rich as you are.
But we are well respected in the city.
Great.
- Yes, sir.
They are decent people.
Really?
- They have a lot of cars and are cultured as well.
So brother, tell us, how much loan do you want?
No, sister-in-law, i am... balli, tell them.
- What should i say?
Uncle, with your permission can i tell them?
- Yes, please.
Mr. Modi, he is his brother-in-law.
Yuvraj.
He has studied till the 8th grade.
The 8th grade.
Raise two more fingers.
Yes, the 8th grade.
He has studied till the 8th grade.
So?
He wants to marry your daughter.
- What?
Brother ballu, you have brought such an alliance?
Have you seen their faces?
They look as if they have just come out of a jungle.
Right.
Will their daughter marry into this illiterate family?
The modis.
They don't have any sense of that.
Fashion.
Nor do they know how to that.
- Talk.
To talk.
They look like that.
That... ape-men.
- Ape-men.
If you weren't my friend i would have done that.
Shot.
- Shot you.
Let's go...
- sumitra. - sumitra.
Let's go.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- Okay.
You ruined their mood.
- Shut up.
Shut up.
You... i'll blow your head with you, you scoundrel.
You fool, he isn't a scoundrel, you are.
Do you know who are you messing with?
You can only make scrabbled-eggs from an egg.
Mr. Modi can turn scrabbled-eggs back to an egg.
You have spoilt the whole game.
But it's okay.
Uncle is here.
He will think of something.
What will i think of?
I am totally confused.
Will you tell us what this is all about?
Why have you made us all wear sunglasses?
Excuse me for my language, grandpa.
But what do these modis think of themselves?
They have kept three conditions for the wedding.
I told them that i won't be able to look into your eyes after telling you those conditions.
And you won't be able to look at each other after hearing them.
He said, "here, make them wear these sunglasses..."
"...and tell them the conditions."
Tell us.
Tell us, what their conditions are.
Basically the modis have made the tent of chaudhary's lives stand on three sticks.
Condition no. 1.
They don't like the way you dress.
What are you doing?
They say that you look like a c-grade movie's villain.
How dare they!
This... this is what uncle said.
How dare they!
- Yes.
Yes.
The chaudharys will never change their dressing sense for their 500 crores.
- Yes.
500...
- crores.
Okay.
Okay.
We will wear up-to-date suits.
Yes.
- Yes.
Yes.
What is their second condition?
Their family is a joint family like in the movie 'hum aapke hain kyon'.
They all live together.
So is our family like in the movie 'kabhi khushi kabhi gham'?
We stay separately?
They have never seen you out on a lunch or a picnic with your daughters and daughters-in-law.
- Enough.
They are womenfolk.
This tradition has been going on since ages.
This is what uncle said as well.
- What?
That the chaudharys will never change their tradition for 500 crores.
Yes.
- 500 crores.
Fine.
Fine.
Listen.
Listen.
Henceforth, we'll all be together.
Tell me the third condition.
If i tell you the third condition then... your pants will tear.
Pants?
- I am saying this.
I am saying this.
He had said something else.
Tell me the condition.
You'll have to cut it.
- What?
You'll have to cut your ponytail.
- No.
Even uncle yelled and said no.
- Yes.
Yes.
But what can we do?
They hold the trump card of 500 crores.
500 crores. 500 crores.
Cut them, amar.
You can always grow them back.
But you don't often get a harvest worth 500 crores.
Great.
Now you are looking that and that.
Bold and beautiful.
- Bold and the beautiful.
So tell us, brother.
What have you decided?
What have i... what do you say, ballu?
Should i do that?
Yes?
- Do it.
Now that you have found a diamond better set it in the ring.
- Yes. - yes.
Fine, then i'll call my daughter and younger that tomorrow.
Brother.
- Brother.
Okay.
- Do you have relatives or brothers or something like that?
No.
He has an elder brother... name?
- Suraj chaudhary.
In spite of having an elder brother you have come alone to fix the alliance?
Where is he?
How can he come here?
We don't get along.
A house where brothers don't that...
- get along.
Get long.
Will their daughter go there?
- The modis.
The modis.
What he means is that their timings don't match.
He is sometimes out and he is sometimes in.
These two brothers love each other a lot.
Like...
lord rama and laxman.
- Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So call them tonight.
Match the... timings.
- Timing.
Yes.
Consider it to be our that...
- condition. - yes.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Don't hit my uncle.
What was the need to say...
- sister-in-law, please, help.
That i have an elder brother?
I said it because you have one.
You could have said that he is dead.
You are strange.
How could say that?
Till date you haven't been able to kill him.
So uncle, how will you kill him?
But we are dead now.
That old man will never listen to us.
Hey, when god gave uncle a head over his shoulders he didn't give it for decoration.
He will think.
He will think of something.
He will bring your brother by his ears.
Shut up.
Suraj chaudhary will behead me even if i talk about it.
And if he doesn't come here then i'll behead you.
What?
Hey, let us go in.
Move aside.
Side.
Side.
Side.
- Who are you?
Keep distance.
Horn please.
May the face of the one with ill-intentions in his heart go black!
Seize the whole place.
Take everyone's mobiles.
Disconnect their phone.
Hey, who are you?
In this manner... this is how we enter.
You have all the right to remain silent as this is a raid.
I pay income tax thirteen times a year.
Yet there is a raid?
Sir, ms.
Sanjana.
Hello, uncle mathur.
Hello, dear.
How are you?
Sanjana, you know these income-tax guys?
Aunt, they are not from the income-tax department.
They are from the world bank.
I have heard of punjab bank and allahabad bank.
What is a world bank?
The one outside punjab and allahabad is called world bank.
The father of all banks.
And the mother of all banks.
Uncle and aunt of all banks.
But, sir, what are you doing here?
Ms. Sanjana's father had taken a loan of200 crores from our bank.
So?
- So he passed away before he could settle the loan.
So?
- He keeps on saying 'so'.
He will lose his mind when he will hear this.
So, we have seized all his property in america.
We have managed to get back 100 crores.
We still need to recover 100 crores.
But sanjana doesn't hold any property here.
She came here to get married to me.
Fantastic.
After marriage a wife has equal right over the property.
Hence, according to law, we will recover 100 crores from you.
The bungalow itself must be worth 50-60 crores.
Come, let's go.
Let's go.
Mr. Lover, i knew that you would get this marriage canceled.
But what is this issue of100 crores?
Should i tell you everything today itself?
What's the rush?
Where are you going?
You are here.
Polish them.
Balli, what kind of a law is this?
The law is according to the place.
Uncle, including this house and other things you will manage to arrange 100 crores, right?
You, too, wouldn't want my deceased father to owe a loan to anyone, right?
Listen, assistant.
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on, let's check the value of the property.
Okay.
- Again?
No.
Actually i have some work with him.
Not now.
Okay?
Fine.
We will begin once your work is done.
Okay, ma'am.
How much work will you do?
You will get tired.
You...
- everyone is standing here.
It's written in the scriptures, uncle the more you work the better it is.
This girl will put me on streets to beg.
Now i got it.
Why did he break the alliance with this girl and formed an alliance with k.k. Modi.
He knows that this girl has a loan over her head.
Balli.
- Yes.
Instead of us, you got k.k. Modi's daughter alliance fixed into amar's family.
If he has ruined it, he will mend it.
How?
- How?
You know b.k. Modi.
- Who is b.k. Modi?
You only had said that k.k. Modi has a younger brother.
Yes.
Yes.
He does.
He does.
K.k. Modi has a younger brother.
But what about him?
- His money.
What about his money?
You only had said...
- what?
That he is richer than his elder brother when it comes to money.
Yes.
Yes.
I said so.
But what about him?
- His daughter.
Daughter.
- Daughter.
His daughter's...
mother will also be there.
What about his daughter?
You had taken the responsibility of getting her married.
Wow, balli.
No matter what you say that's a great condition.
Not condition, connection.
- Whatever.
But tell him mr.
Modi's conditions.
Yes, ma'am.
Coming.
I'll go and check the property.
I'll see how much worth it is.
Darling balli, what conditions do these modis have?
"Forgot tradition and became ready."
"If they get it right they will make it big."
"Money can make you do anything."
Amar!
- Brother!
Brother!
Where is your party?
Has gone to pickup your party at the airport.
Where did she come from?
Did you call her?
It feels very nice to see the two of you together today, uncle.
Now my problem is also over.
Now both of you decide who i should marry.
Dear, you should forget veer.
Last night your mother visited me in my dreams.
And she said, "veer isn't good enough for my sanjana."
So the confusion is over.
I will get married to yuvraj.
No, no, no, no, no, dear.
Yuvraj is absolutely useless.
Your mother visited me in my dreams as well.
She started crying.
She said, "brother, don't ruin my sanjana's life.
More tears.
What about me?
Will i stay single all my life?
- Not at all, dear.
We, your uncles are there for you.
We will find someone good enough for you.
Nice, capable and decent.
We will have a grand wedding for you.
Why do you worry, dear?
We are there for you.
- Yes.
Okay, uncle.
Whatever you feel is right.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Meet him.
He's my younger brother...
- b.
K... b.k. Modi.
- Yes. - modi.
Look who it is.
Ballu.
How are you, ballu?
Hi, b.k. How are you?
You look fit.
I think sister-in-law's love has played its trick.
How is sister-in-law, sakku?
She's absolutely fine.
She keeps talking about all of you.
How is b.
K?
What is he doing these days?
That's fine.
Mr. Modi, the girls didn't come with you?
To hell with the girls.
- What?
- what?
He means say hello to naina and sunaina.
Yes, they are the apple of their mothers' eyes.
Naina.
- Sunaina.
They both are great, aren't they?
Walk straight.
What are you thinking about, uncle?
What are you thinking about?
I couldn't recognize the other modi as well.
Uncle, this means it's not an illness but an imagination.
You mean the character i think about, comes to life?
Yes.
You have the power.
Otherwise, how is it possible, uncle.
What will we call a person with such imagination?
We cannot call him human.
You mean i am... god?
Brahma.
The creator.
The creator of the universe.
Balli.
Balli.
Look... how they address god.
Idiots.
He has regained consciousness.
Now we will have fun.
Start that.
Mr. Chaudhary, he is out of coma, but he is unable to speak.
How can he not speak?
Son... tell me, who was he?
Speak up.
Tell me.
Who was he?
Tell me, son.
Try to speak.
Try.
Uncle, why is he pointing towards you?
Balli.
This means you... no, sir.
I cannot even put a comma to sentence.
How can i put him into coma?
Mr. Chaudhary, your son is still not out of coma.
His mind is spinning hence he is moving his finger here and there.
Look, now he is pointing towards him.
Mr. Chaudhary, your son's condition is so bad that he might even point his finger towards you.
Oh, my.
The son is pointing towards his father.
Please go out.
The patient is getting hyper.
Doctor, make my son get well soon.
Because the day he will come out of coma someone else will go into coma.
Let's go.
Let's go.
There are so many sorrows in this world.
Your sorrow is so less.
You aren't able to say anything because of your unconscious state.
And he cannot say anything even when he is conscious.
So sad is this and how bad is that.
Continue.
Sir.
No, sir.
Madam...
- move back.
I don't care.
Please sir.
Sir, please.
- It's not my problem as to with whom mr.
Chaudhary is having his breakfast and his lunch.
Mr. Chaudhary, i've been looking for you all over the city.
And you are having fun over here.
You are having parties.
I'm being pressurized by the bank.
I keep getting phone calls.
Tell me what you want to do.
Mr. Modi, you are here?
What a pleasant surprise.
Hello, sister-in-law.
- Hello, brother.
Sister-in-law, it seems like you have come here on a holiday.
No, brother.
Our daughters are getting that with the brothers-in-law.
They are getting married with the brothers-in-law.
Mr. Suraj.
- Yes.
Your brother-in-law veer was going to marry your niece, right?
No.
Niece?
Who is his niece?
Here she is.
Sanjana.
She is a very nice girl.
Why do you want to get related to us instead of her?
Actually, what happened was...
- for sanjana's happiness.
Sanjana doesn't like veer and that's why mr.
Chaudhary cancelled the wedding.
Great people.
This is very that.
- Good. - good.
Avery good thing.
But brother, it's wrong as well.
Look brother, there is a young unmarried girl in their family.
And they are getting their brothers-in-law married.
It is wrong, isn't it?
True.
It is not so.
Mr. Chaudhary is looking for a suitable boy for her.
He will get her married as soon as he finds a suitable boy.
Take your time and find a boy.
We are here for four days.
Look, first sanjana will get married then our daughters will.
But mr.
Modi...
- no ifs or buts.
Consider this to be our that.
- Condition. - our condition.
Yes.
- Another condition?
Don't worry.
All the four chaudharys are charged.
They will do something in four days.
Great people.
People, everybody join me please.
"Whether you are a crescent or the moonlight."
"No matter what you are..."
"...i swear on god, you are great."
Clap, everyone.
Great.
Great.
Brother, the chaudharys might get a heart attack listening to your conditions.
Brother has kept a condition ofsanjana's wedding.
- Yes.
But you'll have to give the idea that our prem will be her groom.
Yes.
This condition has been kept to give this idea.
Okay.
But they are very dangerous people.
If they find out the truth... there is one person who is very dangerous.
Lehri.
He is very smart.
But he has already said such a big lie that now if he tells the truth, he will be the first one to die.
'Okay, so this is his family and not the modi family.'
Mr. Balidaan.
Balidaan.
The poor thing is standing as a statue.
Fine, i will bring it into life.
Brother.
Brother.
Brother.
I have come here to tell you a secret.
Here he is.
Here he is.
You are doing pushups?
No, i'm pushing the ground down.
Keep quiet.
Keep quiet.
Tell me, who am i?
Am i god?
Am i a human being?
Who am i?
You are the first god with has been made by this human being.
What not have you made me?
Now even i have forgotten who i am.
I have become the aamir khan in the movie 'gajani'.
Look here.
Look at this.
You have no idea how difficult it is to write on your back!
Rascal.
You played such a big game with a genius like me who has written such a famous book?
Give me the book, please.
Here you go, genius.
I won't let you win as long as i am alive.
What will i do?
Mr. Balli, mr.
Chaudhary is calling you.
Go.
You have been summoned.
Yes.
Yes, i've put the ball in the hole.
I've learnt to play golf.
This is how we used to play marbles as well.
You are right.
- Greetings, sir.
Come.
Come, mr.
Balidaan.
Come.
You summoned me?
We have known each other since ages.
Why don't we turn this acquaintance into a relationship?
I didn't get you.
Your nephew prem and our niece sanjana.
Let's get them married.
- No.
No, this marriage cannot take place.
Why not?
You are a servant.
We are your employer.
You don't like the respect we are giving you?
Hello.
Why cannot this marriage take place, uncle?
We are their loyal servants.
We have to pay them back in someway or the other.
Right, uncle?
- Don't touch me.
You see, the girl has a loan of100 crores over her head.
That too of the world bank.
Who will pay it back?
You?
We will pay it back.
We are going to get millions from the modis.
You can keep 100-125 out of it.
Not 125, only 100 crores.
The amount of the loan.
After that even if you sent your daughter without any clothes on, we will accept her.
Great.
Right, uncle?
We accept it, don't we?
- Yes.
Sanjana, my child... i accept this match, uncle.
Uncle, your teeth will break if you will grind them so hard.
Mr. Chaudhary, there is a problem.
This lehri keeps saying that sanjana had eloped with a boy during her wedding.
If someone comes to know about it on my wedding day then my uncle will be defamed.
Can you please take care of this lehri, sir?
Go and find lehri.
Get him here.
Yes, mr.
Chaudhary?
Who eloped with sanjana?
- This... what is this that you are asking me?
I had shown you the photograph.
A lie.
You are lying.
He had eloped with sanjana.
You are right.
He had eloped with her.
Forgive me, i had lied.
He is the one i had given a lift to.
Henceforth, this is what you should tell everyone.
Got it?
Are you happy now, prem?
Yes, mr.
Chaudhary.
Mr. Lehri, you don't know what a big favour you have done to my uncle and the chaudhary family.
God will surely send you to heaven.
Congratulations, balli.
You became their that.
What is it?
Yes, their relative.
Mr. Modi, you are the one who gave us this idea.
Otherwise, how could we ever think of this?
Have this.
Why did you unnecessarily take the that.
Trouble.
You go and have your meal.
We'll all have together.
No, we don't know how long we will take.
Why should you stay that because of us?
Hungry.
Go, have your meal.
Okay.
- I love you.
That's great, mr.
Modi.
At your place the women eat before the men do.
At our place, till we do eat, the women will die but not touch the food.
This is wrong.
Look, women live in a very that world.
Small.
It begins from and ends at us.
The house and kids.
She is that in them.
What is it said?
Yes, restricted.
Hence it is our duty to look after them.
We should love them.
We should always keep them that.
We should keep them happy.
Radhika... what happened?
Nothing.
You have your meal.
Before you?
So what?
If i drink all night along will you stay hungry till the morning?
What is wrong with you, today?
Love.
I love you.
Sorry.
Shalu.
Shalu?
- Yes, shalani.
Now i will always call you shalu.
And henceforth, you can eat before me.
Why so?
- Because i love you.
Thank you.
Brother, prem is nowhere to be seen.
Sanjana is not here either.
They got what they wanted.
The lovebirds must be busy at some corner.
Yes, so what is wrong in that?
They both that to each other.
They love each other.
They are going to get married.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Come, let's go and have some food.
Come on.
Look, prem and sanjana are also back.
Come on.
The bride and the groom are also here.
Let me make an announcement.
I have decided that this marriage won't take place.
What?
What?
Once again uncle must have gone into the 100 crore loop after having a little too much to drink.
Balli, what are you saying?
Keep quiet.
Keep quiet.
You are saying balli and sacrificing me this marriage won't take place.
If uncle doesn't want this marriage to take place then... without uncle, i don't want to marry like an orphan.
Since when did you become an orphan, you liar?
Here he is.
Your father is here in a three-piece suit.
He is here.
Fine.
Fine.
Fine, ballu.
If you are breaking your that with him.
Then i will form a that with him.
What is it?
Yes, a relationship.
Henceforth, i am your father.
And i am your mother.
I'm your uncle.
I'm your aunt.
If you are falling short of relatives then i, too, shall become one?
Why... why would you become anyone?
You are his uncle.
Keep it fixed.
Then it is fixed.
- Yes.
Henceforth, i am his uncle.
- And i am his aunt.
Look at that.
They all are telling the truth.
Chaudharys, can't you see the truth?
Brother.
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't do this.
Don't do this.
No matter how he is, he is my uncle.
My real uncle.
I'll make him understand.
Uncle, you saw how many relatives i have now?
It won't make a difference if i have one uncle less.
Yes, uncle.
On one hand your final rites will be performed and on the other my wedding ceremony.
Correct.
- But this wedding will surely take place.
Yes, so i will prepare for the wedding.
- Yes.

By the way, prem...
- yes?
Have you come here to show the necklace your family has bought for her or to see sanjana?
I had come to congratulate all of you.
This is the first love marriage taking place in your family.
Yes, of course.
Aryan.
You came from the hospital on the right day.
Come, i'll introduce you to sanjana's future husband.
Don't you want to get ready?
- Ready?
Come on, go.
Go.
- I am ever ready.
Ask sanjana.
Prem.
Prem, look who is here.
He is the one.
He is the one who hit me with his car.
I went into coma because of him.
He was the one who eloped with sanjana.
Look, veer, yuvraj.
Sanjana and prem love each other.
That means everyone is a part of prem's conspiracy.
I'll take care of you later, you wrenched woman.
We will first take care of you.
You are flying too high.
Do you love to fly?
Yes, we do.
- What will you do?
Nothing, boys.
I'll just help you fulfil your dream.
You... where shall i keep it?
We will have to tell brother-in-law about his true identity.
Fools, not the true identity, but a false one.
Never underestimate three things in life.
I, me and myself.
Thank you.
No one can deport the one who has the family's support.
I am someone who can drown a fish.
What can you three... do to me?
Go, veer.
Go, yuvraj.
I'll see how he stops you.
Let's go.
You are sleeping even after coming out of coma?
Do you remember your name?
Aryan.
- Aryan, go into flashback.
And see what i had done to you.
Where did he go?
He left right in front of you.
Mr. Modi.
- Yes.
Mr. Modi.
- What happened?
Mr. Modi.
- What happened?
We know the truth about that scoundrel prem.
He is not balli's nephew.
So?
- He isn't the real modi either.
He is my real uncle.
A kapoor.
Uncle.
- Yes, nephew.
Uncle.
- Uncle, catch them.
We'll see you.
- We'll see you.
Prem, i'll go with you.
- You handle the ladies inside.
I'm a modi.
I'm a modi.
I'm a modi.
Aryan.
Aryan, let's go.
Save us.
Save us.
One... two... three.
The keys.
The keys are with me.
Take it.
Come here... come here... that way.
That way.
Side effects of too much rajma chawal (a rice dish).
Sorry.
O god!
Card.
Card.
- Thank you.
Call me.
No pee me.
Pee them.
Hey, stop peeing there.
Stop him.
Stop him.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Stop there.
Let's go fast.
You are a dead man.
We won't spare you.
What's this new drama.
Bye-bye!
Amar.
Sanjana reminds me of our sister shibani today.
Yes, brother.
Our sanjana looks so happy.
I'm ready to go to the moon for her.
What?
Uncle, looking at her i feel that i won't even need the almond flavoured milk.
Dad.
You know there is a that.
A custom.
Yes, but till date i've never got that of that custom.
A need.
You, too?
- Yes.
Stop this wedding.
Dear good people, someone stop them.
Aryan, you are back from the hospital.
But who did this to you?
That beguiler, prem.
We have been cheated in such a big way.
Why did you do this to us?
Why?
Mr. Chaudhary, this was sanjana's mother's desire.
And there was a belief in her wish.
Her wish was that you two get sanjana married and give her your blessings.
And she believed that you two brothers will unite because of this marriage.
That means you really made a fool out of us.
You cheated us with 500 crores.
That means he is not a modi.
And they are your uncles.
Listen, you idiots.
That's what i've been telling you since so long.
But you didn't listen to me.
You didn't listen to me as well.
Then tell them now.
No, you only tell them.
God sent you down here but he forgot to give you any brains.
You didn't change even after seeing the goodness in him?
But i have changed.
From now on i will be a true uncle to prem.
Let me see who tries to touch my nephew.
Come on.
Coming.
Here you go.
You will touch my nephew.
No, i am here to give you a hand, sir.
- Okay.
Sir, being with them till date i have only washed cars.
Being with you, i am sure i will thrash a person or two.
Great.
Great.
Come on, let's begin the thrashing.
We are the five good men and you are the two evil uncles.
Hippo amar chaudhary, you will get crushed in their fight.
Come here.
Fools, what are you waiting for?
Shoot them all.
We have come to attend the wedding.
We support love and not hatred.
Prem has changed us.
By giving double the money.
Let's go, hired goons.
Traitors.
Prem, you continue.
It's inauspicious to stop that in the middle.
That... that...
- the wedding vows.
The wedding vows.
The wedding vows.
Come on.
Let's go.
Priest, hurry up.
Otherwise, my father and the rest of them will get thrashed.
Come.
Can i hold it?
Shall i start walking?
Come on, son.
Priest, please hurry up.
I'll shut down your world bank.
Fast.
Fast.
I'm safe.
No.
This will be fine, choudhary.
This is too much.
Prem, you can get another wife but you won't get another father.
Today, for the first time a woman has said something sensible.
Go, prem.
Prem, you won't get a better chance to remove your shirt.
Show your body.
- I won't.
Why?
- He has become fat.
Fat.
What shall i say?
Enjoyed it?
Mr. Chaudhary, i am here to form relations and not to break bones.
Anyway, at our place we don't even look into the eyes of senior citizens.
Raising a hand on them is a farfetched thing.
Hence, chill and relax, mr.
Chaudhary.
Chill and relax.
Saw that?
This is what is called good values.
But are miles away from it.
Yes, you only know the meaning of greed selfishness and deception.
You didn't even bother about my mother, you deceased sister.
How low will you stoop for money?
My child is absolutely right.
On one hand this boy is making sacrifices for his future wife.
And on the other it's you guys who since ages have been making your wives sacrifice.
I'm feeling ashamed to call both of you my sons.
Shame on you.
Disgusting.
Hey old man, have you lost your mind.
Father.
Get up, father.
Father... don't you dare!
He is our father.
I will cut your hand if you even touch him.
And i will break your jaw if you misbehave with him.
He lied.
He cheated everyone.
And you are... they aren't even modis.
What difference does the name make, son?
A person is known for his deeds.
And then, when have we ever acted like chaudharys?
We have instead demeaned the chaudhary name.
They are the real chaudharys.
No, we are very satisfied being kapoors.
How can he be a chaudhary?
He has made us fight.
Brother-in-law, we should take revenge from him.
Revenge for what?
We should seek revenge because he made us human?
We should seek revenge because by changing relations he changed us.
We brothers have been enemies since ages.
But today when our father got hurt our hearts felt the pain.
Should we seek revenge for that?
We should learn from this family.
Just being a part of a family doesn't make you a dear one.
A member is a dear one when you accept him.
Sir.
Sorry.
Sir... we hold our ears and say that we will never act like goons again.
And we will never be greedy for money.
And one more thing, sir.
Mr. Modi, what is your original surname.
Kapoor.
Kapoor.
- Mr. Kapoor, please forgive us.
And accept us.
Let us be a part of this wedding along with our girl, please.
Madam.
Chaudharys plus kapoors equals to chapoors.
Mrs. Chapoor.
Oh, my, mrs.
Chapoor.
Someone stop her.
Ready?
Ready!
One, two, three, four, five, six, ready.

'My name is Prem.
I was introduced to you in the end.'
Hello, Mr. Aasim.
- Hello!
'This is my family.
The people you see on the screen right now..'
'The gentleman is my father.'
'And the lady is my mother.'
'My dad has a terrible habit of.. what was it again..'
'Yes, of forgetting things.
Come, I will show you the proof.'
You are that.
- That?
Welcome to the wedding.
- Yes.
Come inside and keep that.
The gift?
- That.
No, no, no, that.
That.
Please have a seat.
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.
Welcome.
Welcome.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Wow!
The steamed potatoes have no steam in them.
And there is no saffron in the saffron sweetmeat.
Really?
What really?
I was just tasting them.
Look, what happened with all the tasting that you've done.
'That's Prem's uncle, Laxman Kapoor.'
'And his wife, Kiran.'
"I love you.
I love you.
I love you."
What is it?
You are dancing with joy.
Why?
- You didn't dance so much at our wedding.
I'm celebrating someone else's joy.
That was a suicide.
- Suicide?
My joy.
Does anyone dancing when he is happy?
Not suicide.
'That's Prem's uncle, Bharat Kapoor.'
'And his wife, Suman.'
Look, brothers, if there is that at that then that will happen.
What that and that will happen?
If there is lack of anything at the wedding..
..then we will get defamed.
- Okay.
Okay.
Don't worry, brother..
- Everything will be fine.
- Sure?
'These three brothers love each other a lot, like Ram, Laxman and Bharat.'
'And co-incidentally their names are..'
'..
Ram, Laxman, Bharat.'
By the way, where is my that?
That?
Liquor bottle?
- No, brother.
Not during the day.
It will ruin the wedding.
- No, it is taller than a bottle.
That..
That..
- The bride.
She is inside.
- Not the bride.
That..
That..
A child.
- How can there be a child when he is not married?
My child.
My child.
- His child.
Prem.
Prem.
Say that.
Where is that idiot?
- No, brother.
Don't call him an idiot.
This wedding is taking place because of him.
- Yes.
Khushi would have never agreed..
..if he wouldn't have reasoned it out with her.
- Right.
'Khaman Dhokla'.
- 'Khaman Dhokla'..
- Brother..
Gaurav had gone inside to meet Khushi for two minutes.
Half an hour has passed by.
Go and check what's happening.
The auspicious hour is passing by.
- Really?
'It is their friend and neighbour Mr. Pathak's daughter's wedding..'
'..whose name co-incidentally is Khushi.'
Khushi.
Khushi, my child.
Where are you?
Son-in-law.
Son-in-law.. what happened?
Who did all this?
Where is Khushi?
She ran away.
- She ran away?
She ran away with her lover.
- Lover?
Who is her lover?
Your neighbour, the Kapoors..
Their pampered, spoilt, rascal, scoundrel son.
Prem.

Then sign here.
- Okay.
Thank you.
Take this.
Here you go.
Exchange the garlands.
You are now husband and wife.
Click a photograph.
Just a second.
Click it.
Click it.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I was not in town.
If you wouldn't have helped her run away..
..her father would have got her married to someone else.
Yes.
And I would have become someone else's wife.
Not a chance.
Here's my card.
You are a registrar here.
We know.
No, no, no.
This is my other card.
I'm also a divorce lawyer.
I've dissolved more marriages than I've performed.
And looking at the two of you I feel..
..that you will definitely need me in future.
I know love is blind.
But marriage makes everyone see things clearly.
Do you see things clearly?
I'm still blind.
I've already married thrice.
I'm waiting to get married for the fourth time.
What kind of a man is he?
- Thank you.
Let's go.
Let's go.
We don't want your card.
Sir.
Sir, at least take the card.
Sir..
Who is he?
- He was getting married to her.
Look, brother, she was being forcefully to marry you.
And that's why..
- Forget it.
I was being forced to marry her.
What?
- I had come to tell Khushi that I love Kiran.
But I didn't get a chance to talk.
I was hit with a stick on my head and I fell unconscious.
I won't spare you.
- Brother, no..
Stop it, Gaurav.
Stop it.
We should thank them.
- Yes.
We wouldn't be together if he wouldn't have helped Khushi elope.
Say thanks.
Kiran.
- Hi.
How are you?
Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
Hurry up, the two of you.
Come here and get married.
I have to go and get someone divorced.
Let's go.
It's time for our flight as well.
We'll make a move.
Thank you so much.
- See you.
Take care.
Brother Prem.
- What?
Brother Prem, everyone inside..
Pathak shitting petrol.
Shitting?
- Seating sofa.
Oh, seating.
- Yes.
Okay.
You parking bike.
I'm seeing how much shitting.
He is here.
He is here.
He is here.
I'll set myself on fire.
I'll kill myself.
This drama has been going on since last night.
Neither is he sleeping nor is he letting us sleep.
Whenever he dries a little he wets himself again with petrol.
Mr. Pathak, if you wish to set yourself on fire..
..please do so outside, in the garden.
Why are you burning our house with you?
- Quiet.
Yes, exactly.
You heard that?
You heard that?
After ruining my family he is talking about his house.
Daddy, why don't you dive and snatch it?
Shut up.
You have done that.
- Awrong thing.
Awrong thing.
Yes.
- Stay away.
Stay away.
Stay away.
I'll set myself on fire.
Brother..
- Stay away.
Stay away.
Stay away.
Brother, Khushi is notjust your daughter but his friend as well.
Yes.
- Yes.
I'm sure she must have seen something special in Raju.
I'm sure the day you see them happy, you will forgive them.
That day will never come in my life.
And there are hardly any days left in my life.
Perhaps not even one.
Yes.
He is right.
He is right, right?
Then keep this aside.
I'll commit suicide.
- You..
I'll commit suicide.
- Who are you threatening?
I'll help you.
Does anyone have a lighter?
No, I don't have it.
This lighter..
- You started smoking?
- You started smoking?
Shame on you.
- Brother, I didn't..
Don't change the topic.
What were you saying?
I'll help you deep fry.
What are you doing?
Prem?
- What is this?
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Prem?
Prem?
Prem?
- Will Mr. Pathak's death affect anyone of you?
No.
- No.
- Will the world end?
What..
What..
What..
I will burn him down.
Okay.
I won't spare you.
I won't spare you.
- Prem.
Prem.
You'll ruin everything.
- Prem.
Something has to be done about this boy.
Hello, Guru.
Hello.
- Come.
Come, Ram.
Have a seat.
Have a seat.
Look, Ram..
- Yes?
Prem has done a good deed by uniting two lovers.
Guru, he ended brother and Mr. Pathak's age old friendship.
Yes.
- Prem that's the talks of his marriage even before it starts.
What is it called?
- Ends.
- He ends it.
Last month Guru sent a dog to your place, right?
Yes.
She is very nice.
- Yes.
She keeps everyone happy.
- Yes.
He sent two maids for household chores.
Naina and Sunaina.
They are very nice girls.
But cannot get Prem married to them.
- Right.
Right.
Similarly, Guru has found a bride for Prem.
Ram, listen to me.
You know the Malhotras from America..
Yes.
- Their daughter is perfect for Prem.
Yes.
She is a Bandit Queen.
A Bandit Queen?
- A Bandit Queen?
Phoolan.
- Only her behavior.
She is very good at heart.
Her name is Pooja.
- Wonderful!
She is the only girl who can change Prem.
Guru, then why are you doing that in this?
Why are you delaying this?
- Why the delay?
She is coming to Bangkok tomorrow for her friend's wedding.
It will be great if Prem likes her.
Whether Prem likes her or not..
..only Pooja will come to our house as that.
What?
- A bride.
- A bride.
A bride.
- Yes.
Hello.
- Karan, I've been trying all six numbers of yours since so long.
Tell me what happened to the wedding.
I ran away from the wedding.
But my passport is with them.
What?
It'll take at least 10-15 days to make a new passport.
But what will I do in the meanwhile?
They will find me.
I'll call you later.
- Hello!
Hello!
Hi, Pooja.
Do you need a ride?
No, thank you.
Prem and his uncle are coming to fetch me.
Prem, Pooja is coming at Terminal 3..
..why are we standing at Terminal 7?
That's the game plan.
- Why are you throwing it?
How will Pooja recognize us?
That's what I want.
She shouldn't recognize us.
Why
What are you doing?
What is this..
This.. is a proof for my father that we went to the airport..
..but Pooja Malhotra didn't come here.
So we came here..
- Uncle, tell me one thing.
Neither you nor I have ever seen her.
Nor has anyone in the family has seen her.
Guru has sent an imported Pooja Malhotra from America..
..so that she marries me and changes me?
- Correct.
Uncle, I need a very impish, roguish and talented wife.
Impish, roguish and talented?
But nowadays it's so difficult to find..
..an impish, roguish and talented wife.
All of them are married.
I am there.
But what will tell our Guru?
Let the Guru's mother go to hell.
Does he have a sister?
- Yes.
Then we shall send both of them.
- Okay.
Both mother and sister will go to hell.
Prem.
Who called me Prem so hatefully?
What did you think?
I will wait for you at Terminal 3?
And you will click a photograph here..
,and fool father?
- Pooja.
How did you recognize us?
Not you, him.
Daddy had given his description when I was leaving America.
I scanned the entire airport.
He was the only rogue with an innocent face.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
What an image you have, Prem.
I'm proud of you.
Why are you in a wedding dress?
What did you think?
I'll come from America in a two-piece bikini?
It would've been better.
- Just shut up.
Come on!
Let's go.
Excuse me.
Don't take advantage of the situation.
And don't you dare touch me.
Let's go.
Wow.
Impish, roguish and talented.
I should have asked for something else, uncle.
What better could have you asked for?
Think about it.
Ayoung and old imp at home.
And they will bet on who is more impish.
Your aunt and she will get along well.
Truly.
I'll bet on your girl.
They are here.
Pooja is here.
Pooja is here.
Brother, is she Pooja?
Or has he brought some other girl from her wedding?
You all must be surprised, right?
Seeing me dressed as a bride.
You see, a girl looks her best in a wedding dress.
So, I told myself, "Pooja, don't take a chance."
"If you want to impress everyone.."
"..then go dressed as a bride.
- Very impressed."
Impish.
Okay, tell me, how did you like our Prem?
Yes.
How did you like you?
I liked all of you a lot.
Very talented.
And if all of you support me then..
..we will change him for good as well.
Talented also.
- Okay.
Then all of us are with you.
Come in.
Come in.
Come in.
- Come in, dear.
She will change him for good.
She didn't bring any bags with her.
What was the need to bring any luggage?
I'm not staying in a hotel.
I'm staying with my in-laws.
There is anything lacking in here?
Yes, only that like you was lacking.
That..
What?
- What do you call a son's that?
Daughter-in-law.
- We were only lacking a daughter-in-law..
..and now your presence has changed that as well.
Your father has become that.
- Mad?
Should I tell your father?
You are saying such things about my elder brother?
Yes?
Tell us, when are you going for the wedding?
I just ran from a wedding.
You ran away from it?
But you were going to Phuket for your friend's wedding, right?
Yes, I was going to.
What do you mean, "I was going to?"
If you didn't go there then how did you ran away from it?
By ran away I mean I got rid of it with great difficulty.
Why would I unnecessarily waste my time in Phuket?
That's right.
Why waste time in Phuket?
If I would attend my friend's wedding..
..then how would I make arrangements for my wedding?
And I have to fulfil the responsibility Guru has given me.
She will marry you.
She is wishful-serpent.
I will never let her wish come true.
Sir, Pooja's on the line.
Pooja?
- Pooja?
It's for Pooja.
Give it to me.
Hello.
Hi.
How are you?
I'm standing at the airport since the last two hours..
..and you are asking how are you?
I'm not okay, understand?
My friend.
The one who is getting married.
She is very angry.
Anyway, look, I am waiting at the airport, come on.
And he didn't come to pick me up.
- Didn't get the time.
I have come here from America and he didn't get the time?
If you don't believe me then talk to Prem's dad.
I?
- Dad, she is calling all of you.
Tell her that you all are not free.
- Yes.
Look, we cannot come.
We don't have that.
Tell her that we don't have a car.
- No, we have a car.
The thing that moves like this.
Pendulum.
- We don't have a pendulum.
Excuse me?
- Time.
No, we don't have time.
Sorry.
Heard that?
Now do you believe me?
If you don't have time then even I am not stupid..
..to waste my time for you over here.
I'm going to attend my friend's wedding.
And I'll go to Guru's ashram after 8-10 days.
If you finally have the time and you wish to meet me..
..then you can come there.
Understand?
Okay.
That's a great idea.
Bye.
Come, Pooja, I'll take you to the guestroom.
Aunt, am I a guest that I'll stay in the guest room?
I'll stay in Prem's room.
In Prem's room?
- Before this?
Before marriage?
Until we get married, Prem will stay in the guestroom.
Yes.
Don't worry about him.
He can also sleep on a table.
Look, he is sleeping.
Ma'am, if you want to stay then stay in the guestroom..
..otherwise, I'll make you disappear in such a way..
Prem.
- Daddy, my room..
Uncle, cool down.
Now I am here.
I'll handle it.
Now look here, my future husband.
For now, I have just snatched your room.
After that I'll snatch your sleep and peace of mind as well.
I'll make you empty.
Empty.
You..
- No abusing.
Come, aunt.
Show me my room.
Go.
Go.
Show it to her.
- I'll be right back.
Brother, she will set him straight.
Isn't she very delicate?
- She is a lizard.
A lizard.
I don't know where that girl is.
I'm telling the truth.
You lost her.
My men couldn't find her.
Where did she go?
She doesn't know anyone in the city.
And no one knows her.
Where can she go?
Where can she go?
Where?
Where?
Hit him.
I want her at any cost before Suraj Chaudhary to her.
Someone stop me.
She is one piece from head to toe.
How do I cut her into pieces?
Prem, control your mind.
I'll control my mind but..
This girl with a face that looks a mix of banana and mango..
If you scream this Rampuri dagger will take to straight to Lord Rama.
You are taking advantage of the situation.
Situation?
Advantage?
Again?
She will yak and force someone..
..to think about it even if he isn't in the mood.
But what will you gain by killing me?
The CEO of fools, I won't benefit from it, you will.
I'll double your value.
- What?
How much is a live chicken worth?
- Rs.100.
And how much is a Tandoori chicken worth?
- 200.
So doesn't that double the value after death?
You will snatch my peace of mind?
You will snatch my room?
If you don't leave by tomorrow morning..
..then I swear by Baba Ramdev..
..I will kill you.
What happened?
- What happened, dear?
What happened?
- What happened?
What happened?
She must have had a nightmare.
She must have screamed.
A lot can happen in a nightmare.
Like..
Yes, a sneeze.
I was dreaming?
- Look, she is agreeing.
Come on, go back to sleep.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- She was dreaming.
Let us know if you need anything.
- Let's go.
Okay, goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Never underestimate three things in life.
Shucks..
Me, me and me.
Now you only bloody decide whether..
..you have to come to this house in a palanquin..
..or you want to leave this house.. as a dead person.
"Oh, Lord of the whole universe."
"Mighty Lord of the whole universe."
"All Thy devotees' agonies.."
"All Thy devotees' sorrows.."
"Instantly Thou banish."
"Oh, Lord of the whole universe."
Great.
I feel I am going to have a great day in office.
After all my day began with such a nice prayer.
You have been named aptly.
We are feeling as if we are in Hardiwar.
- Yes.
We have got such a nice daughter-in-law.
Dear, you are so cultured and you have such good values..
..in spite of living in America.
Bush taught Obama and Obama taught her.
So who is her mother is in America?
Obama?
Listen..
To celebrate Pooja arrival we will distribute that in the office.
That..
- Tennis ball?
No, not that.
- Paperweight.
'Ladoo' (Indian sweet).
Right, brother?
Yes. 'Ladoos'.
We will distribute 'Ladoo'.
We will distribute 'Ladoos'.
Yes, they are round as well.
The world is also round.
Should we distribute that?
- No, no, no.
What kind of people there are in the world, uncle.
Of different types.
They neither pray in the morning nor go to work.
Yes.
- True, dear.
There are such people as well.
What times have come!
There's a demon staying in a God's house.
I'll have to use my demonic mind.
Uncle.
- What happened?
What happened?
What happened?
- Nothing.
It's a small injury.
Should I seek revenge?
Here you go.
Mother Earth.
Bad mummy.
Bad mummy, Mother Earth.
- Sorry, uncle.
He was trying to make me fall but you fell instead.
But why was he trying to make you fall?
Anger.
I said a few true things and he got angry.
He got irritated.
Why get irritated with it?
She is telling the truth.
He is always either on his bike or his skates.
Otherwise he keeps building his body in the spare time.
Why are you ruining my healthy body?
Everyone is saying something or the other..
..don't you have to say something?
God sent him here to increase the burden on earth.
You are telling the truth for the first time.
We have been given a life..
..only so that he can disgrace us.
Absolutely right.
- He is a big disgrace.
You have a great sense of honour, uncle.
Even a Satan will look like a God in front of him.
Great.
- Wonderful.
He is..
- I think I'll have to tell aunt about your affair, uncle.
I'm not saying it from my heart.
Don't take it to your heart.
My hand broke.
- Be careful.
Be careful.
Be careful.
Take me to a hospital.
- We'll have to do something about her.
She's digging a grave for you.
What happened?
- I cannot move it.
I'll handle her.
Because uncle, once she is gone, life is fun.
Great, Pooja.
Great.
- Enough.
It is delicious.
- Fantastic.
- She cooks so well.
- Yes.
Outstanding.
Outstanding.
Yes.
- And she sings so well.
- Yes.
And she is also changing our spoilt brat for good.
- Yes.
Look, he is here.
Son, your name is Prem (love) and not 'Hatred'.
Right?
- Really?
Hey, listen.
Hello.
- Sit.
Madam, go.
Go to the airport.
Come on.
Why?
- Your father has sent a parcel for you.
From USA.
- Yes, so why are you giving me the news?
You should have collected it for me.
He is useless.
You sing so well.
You cook so well.
What would have happened if you had studied a little as well?
The officer there won't give the parcel to me without your signature.
You only will have to go there.
How will the poor girl go to airport alone?
You go with her, Prem.
Am I her driver, chauffer or servant?
Brother.
- Prem, you go with her.
Daddy, you are very that.
- I am very boring.
But still, you will go.
Go, dear.
Go.
Yes, but dad didn't inform me over the phone.
Oh, fax.
- What?
He has sent a fax, you dirty mind.
Why are you wasting time talking, Prem?
The parcel will go back.
Come on, leave.
Go.
Please go, son.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Be careful.
I think he's up to something.
I have a mobile.
I'll call if anything happens.
Only if he will let you call.
'I could've easily spent 10-12 days in this house..'
'..if he wouldn't have been born here.'
'She has made my family crazy about her in two days.'
'I would be dead if she would stay for 12 days.'
'He cannot stop taking advantage.'
'We take advantage of those we would gain something from.'
'I am just trying to get rid of her.'
'Airport is on the left and he is taking a right turn.'
'Is he planning to take me to the jungle and..'
'No, madam.
If I do any such thing..'
'..then I'll get stuck with you forever.'
'Then I will have to marry you.'
'Then why is he taking me to a jungle?
'
'Will he leave me amidst wild animals?
'
'I would have if I wasn't so concerned about the poor animals.'
'I think I'll have to show her a few lions.'
How can you even think of such a thing?
What are you doing?
Where are the keys?
- I threw it.
The steering wheel got locked.
Why did you throw it?
Are you a woman or what?
I'm a woman.
- If you are a woman..
..then you should have kept the keys here, like a woman.
Keys are not kept there.
Keys are kept around the waist.
To hell with your 26" waist.
I can see a six and a half foot grave there.
Move the steering wheel.
No, steering wheel has failed.
The steering wheel has failed.
Your mind has failed.
But the brakes didn't fail, right?
- No, they didn't.
Prem.
- She's gone.
- Prem.
Prem.
Prem.
Prem.
Where are you?
- I am here.
Down here.
She was hanging me, now God has hanged her.
Are you dead or alive?
I'm still alive, but I can die anytime.
Help me.
- Okay.
Take this.
Take my hand.
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come closer first.
No, I am thinking that it's better..
..if one person dies rather than two.
Coward.
Dastard.
Pansy.
Chicken.
Should I come there to help you so that you can help me?
Let me ask help for myself first.
Hurry up.
- Help me, God.
Give me your leg.
- You are already hanging.
How else should I hang you?
I mean give me your leg.
Leg?
Man and woman look good in pair.
But to touch something with ones' leg is a grave sin.
You are hanging on the branch with both your hands.
How will you save me?
Ma'am, each hand of mine has 2 times a gorilla's strength.
Depending on age and size.
By the way, I can save you with one hand.
Then Useless, use that hand.
Hold my waist and pull me.
No, no, no.
Not the waist.
Then you will say that I took advantage.
What?
- By the way your waist is..
Let my waist go to hell.
Hold whatever you want.
Do whatever you want.
But please save me.
In that case, come to me, my suitcase.
Look madam, you are taking advantage of my disadvantage.
- What?
If you come any closer, then I swear..
..I'll let go of both the hands and embrace you.
And both of us will be dead.
Please save me.
Let's go.
What are you doing?
Just hanging around.
Don't worry.
You women are amazing.
You cannot stick on to anything other than your age.
Sometimes you say take the advantage..
..sometimes you say don't take advantage.
What nonsense is this?
All your yakking is making me go crazy.
It was the demand of the situation.
I wasn't wrong to touch you now.
I was wrong to touch you earlier.
If this is not wrong then why is that wrong?
And if that is wrong then why isn't this wrong?
Actually, you are wrong.
It is wrong to sit here and talk to you.
It's of no use.
I'll lie down.
Obviously it's of no use.
I'm sitting and you are lying down.
It would've benefited if either, both of us were sitting or lying down.
Look, don't say double meaning things to me.
This is a limit to illiteracy.
Where is a double meaning in it?
Look, don't turn and sleep like this.
I feel something inside.
By the way, the jean fits well..
..on your waist.
My ill-fate I wish he wasn't a man.
And you weren't a woman.
Sanjana Singh.
Pooja has horns.
Prem!
'Prem.
Prem.
Prem.'
Isn't it a great place?
You call out once and it echoes back a number of times.
You have brought me here to hear this?
Oh, no.
This is nothing.
Now I'll shout your name and see what name echoes back.
Should I?
Sanjana!
'Sanjana.
Sanjana.
Sanjana.'
Hear it.
'Sanjana.
Sanjana.
Sanjana.'
I'm saying Pooja and it is echoing back as Sanjana.
Isn't it a strange place?
Look, the valley is so deep.
Prem.
- Only echoes come back from here, not people.
Tell me the truth.
Who are you?
Otherwise, I'll let go of you.
I'll tell you the truth.
Pull be back first.
Come on, start your story.
You already know my real name.
Sanjana Singh.
Actually, I had come from America to get married.
But the guy I was going to get married to..
..turned out to be a famous don's son.
I ran away from the wedding but they snatched my passport.
It takes at least 10-12 days to make a new passport.
I needed a place to hide as well.
Then I saw you at the airport.
You had come to pick up Pooja and no one knew Pooja.
So I thought..
You know the rest.
- I know the rest.
What did you do with the real Pooja?
I hope you didn't murder her.
No.
She has gone to attend her friend's wedding, in Phuket.
She will go to Guru's ashram from there.
Guru.
Guru.
Guru.
He is a..
Let's go.
Prem.
Hey, move aside.
"My heart broke."
"My heart broke."
"My heart went crazy."
I think you want me..
..to give you a lift.
You are very handsome and dashing..
..brother.
- Brother?
This car won't go anywhere.
It has broken-down.
Why?
What happened, darling?
Darling?
- The car will run.
It will get repaired.
I'm a mechanic.
It's my job.
Hope in.
Yes.
- But you didn't ask me where you should drop me.
I haven't caught you as yet, to drop you.
First let me introduce myself.
I'm Mr. Lehri.
I'm sure you know Bhappi Lehri.
There is no connection between us.
Yes, there is a connection.
He likes gold and I like to sleep.
Hello.
Why are you whistling?
You've already won over me.
Are you from Pataya?
Who is he?
Is he your boyfriend?
No, he is a distant friend.
- A distant friend?
Just like a distant relative.
Okay.
Then I have no problem..
..because I am shortsighted.
So shall we leave, Mr. Weak?
Hello.
I keep a person like you as my driver.
Really?
- Yes.
- Then give me the keys.
Come on.
The key is in its place.
I got a driver.
Come on, darling.
Come behind.
Come on.
Come on.
Watch your feet.
You aren't in the mood to come behind?
Not a problem.
We'll talk from here.
Great.
It's such a young and beautiful weather.
When I look at you I remember a romantic phrase.
Tell me.
Mingle in jungle.
I, too, remember a phrase when I see you.
A.K. Hangal in the jungle.
You know liquor and beauty have a deep connection?
I'm often intoxicated and the evening passes away.
There will be a day when the evening will be intoxicated..
..and you will pass away.
Hello.
I'm not here to get insulted.
Where do you usually go to get insulted?
Where will I go?
I stay at home.
I'm married.
You give a lift to a single girl even when you are married?
Who doesn't?
I only give, you take it as well, forcefully.
Watch out!
What is he doing up there?
Plucking fruits.
He plucked a lot of fruits.
Oh no!
- What have you done?
I didn't do it.
You did it.
Hard work paid off, didn't it?
You were driving very passionately.
Whose car is this?
- This is my car.
It's not a car.
It is my wife.
I love it.
If your wife has an affair with someone..
..then who will work hard on her?
Her lover, who else?
Who will enjoy it?
- My wife, who else?
Who will get punished?
- Me, who else?
So just imagine.
She is your wife.
Who was working hard on her?
- You.
Who was enjoying it?
- She was.
Who will get punished?
Me, who else?
Because it was my car.
Don't cry, my son.
Be strong.
The Lord works in mysterious ways, my son.
Have this fruit.
You are a Father?
Father.
Father, I had bad thoughts about her.
Father, I'm a sinner.
I've committed a grave sin, Father.
I am a sinner.
Hey!
Stop the car.
There's the girl.
What have I done!
- Prem, let's go.
They are his men.
Come.
- Come on.
Come on.
Fast.
Or she'll escape.
- I want to confess.
Where is that girl?
- Which girl?
The one who was standing here with you.
Your sister.
She..
Sister?
I think she ran away with brother-in-law.
Listen, have you seen our boss?
Who is your boss?
- Tall, board, huge man.
Okay, this..
What are you asking?
I'm selling these fruits here.
The fruits of hard work.
These fruits are very tasty.
Just taste them.
No.
I didn't.
My car hit him.
Get him.
- My car hit him.
Mr. Chaudhary, your son has gone into coma..
..because of excess blood loss.
I don't know when he will regain consciousness.
Quickly resuscitate him, Doctor..
..otherwise, I will sent you into coma.
Send me as well, sir.
To my home, sir.
Look, sir, it was my car but your son was hit by that boy.
I don't even now how to drive a car.
I swear on him.
Let him go.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
So sweet.
Yes.
Sir, I am leaving but before leaving..
..I would like to give you a small warning.
Sir, that boy is very smart.
He is fast, in driving cars and using his brain as well.
If he will come before you he will do such actions that..
..you will forget to give reactions.
Has anyone seen that boy?
Has anyone seen that boy?
I've only seen him from the left side.
And I've only seen him from the right side.
Sir, what is this left and right.
I've seen him from centre.
Will you be able to recognize him?
You are talking about recognizing?
Actually, I was born when I was small.
My mother was a woman.
And the person who murdered my father..
..underwent plastic surgery thrice.
Yet I recognized him.
Because he used to come to our shop to buy the plastic.
From now onwards, this plastic will always be with us.
Take him away.
- No.
This is wrong.
Shut up.
- This is wrong.
Find that boy and Sanjana.
Wherever they are hiding find them.
What?
- What kind of childishness is this, Pooja?
Is this a way to behave?
Does anyone hold and push anyone like this?
How was that?
- What did you do?
Like this..
Like this..
What did you do?
- What did I do?
You held her like this and pushed her like this.
The push she got had that.
The push she got had minimal effect?
- Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
Take your position.
- From there.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Come, come, one by one.
- Come on.
Come on.
Talk to your darling nephew.
- Yes.
From the time they have returned from the jungle..
..there is a lot of fun happening around.
"It is fun.
It is fun.
It is fun."
"It is fun.
It is fun.
It is fun."
Excuse me.
Just friends.
- Play the wedding tune.
Just friends.
Prem!
Prem, your method was wrong but your intentions were good.
Now I have no complaints against you.
- Mr. Pathak.
No.
No.
No.
My Khushi is so happy with Raju that I forgot all my sorrows.
Great.
Great.
Great.
- That's great.
You know I'm going to London.
Raju sent the tickets.
- Of economic class?
Yes.
- Yes.
How do you know that?
- Because I gave Raju the idea.
I told him not to buy first class tickets as you are such a miser..
..that you will be happy even with economic class ticket.
What happened?
- It got wet.
- What?
What is this, Daddy?
You always say double meaning things.
There is no double meaning in it.
The thing which we talk.
With which..
Mobile.
Mobile.
Mobile.
- Mobile?
My purse.
- My money.
My purse.
Your underwear.
Let's get out of this.
Today, I got that and after a long time that happened.
You got wet and fell in love?
No, I caught cold.
Today, the Sunday truly feels like a Sunday.
A Sunday will always be a Sunday.
- Yes.
We never go in the swimming pool together even if we want to, right?
Really.
- Thank you, Pooja.
- You're welcome.
Welcome.
Thank you.
I am Ready.
But there is a No Entry here.
Someone stop me.
Sir.
Ajunior priest has come from Guru's place.
He is here?
- Yes.
Make him comfortable..
- Yes.
The junior priest is here.
I'll go meet him and welcome him.
My wallet..
From the drawer..
That one.
Yes.
And the wallet..
Priest, why are you here?
I mean what brings you here?
I'll tell that later, but Guru is very angry with you.
Why?
- Why didn't you go to pick up Pooja from the airport?
I had gone there..
..but I got a little late.
She left to attend the wedding.
Yes, she will be going to the ashram directly from the wedding.
Be there on time to pick her up.
- As you say.
Where is everyone else?
- They are with Pooja..
But Pooja is..
- Not this one, the Pooja which was sent last month.
We sent a dog last month..
- Don't call her a dog.
The family members have named her Pooja.
They have named her Pooja?
A dog..
- Again you are calling her a dog.
Doggie, dog, puppy, pup, Raju, Tommy.
Nothing.
Call her Pooja.
Otherwise with a broom..
They are so madly in love with her that nowadays we eat dog food..
Dog..
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Pooja's food.
Pedigree and White Kennel.
So what should I call her?
Pooja?
Don't call her that if you want to lose your loincloth..
..and your honour.
Hello, Priest.
They are here to serve you.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Bless you.
Bless you.
Guru had kept a 'Satyanarayan' ritual..
- Very good.
He has sent the offering of that.
Sanjana..
As soon as they call for Pooja you come with the dog.
Tell me, where is Pooja.
She is here.
Pooja.
Now what do I tell you, Priest.
We have got very attached to Pooja in such a short span.
She is so sweet that as soon as she came, Prem..
She won everyone's heart.
'Oh God, what magic has this dog done in one month?
'
Our Pooja is as decent as she is beautiful.
'A decent dog?
'
'Have they lost their mind?
'
She is now our family member.
Does she bite?
What kind of a joke is that?
Is she a suckling that she will bite?
She is of marriageable age.
It's a different thing if she starts biting after marriage.
Whether she bites, scratches or does anything else..
..we have decided that she'll be the daughter-in-law of our family.
'They will make a dog their daughter-in-law?
'
'A dog will be perfect for you, son.'
'You deserve this.'
What are you thinking about?
That is happening with Guru's permission.
'Dandiya', 'Garba' (Gujarati dance forms).
No, no, no.
That..
That..
That..
Yes.
The alliance.
- The alliance.
The alliance.
'I think they have gone absolutely crazy.'
'They didn't go to pick up the Pooja Guru had sent..'
'..from the airport.'
'They have named their dog Pooja..'
'..and they are getting him married to her.'
'I'll also go crazy if I stay here any longer.'
I'll make a move.
Have lunch before you leave.
- Yes.
Pooja's favourite dishes have been made today.
'Oh, God.
They are feeding dog food to a priest?
'
Look, I..
You can have it.
I'm fasting today.
I'll make a move.
- Bye.
- Okay, Priest.
- Okay, Priest.
Who is this girl?
You don't recognize her?
You are strange.
She is our maid.
You had brought her here from the ashram.
'Look at that.
These lunatics think I am crazy.'
'I hope I really don't go crazy.'
Excuse me.
I'll make a move.
Okay.
- Okay.
"Baby, I can see the sun rising in your eyes."
"Baby, every time I think of you, you make me smile."
"Baby, I'll be your every dream and you should know.."
"Baby, I'll never ever want to let you go."
"Love is the dawn of the slumber of life."
"Love is a very beautiful punishment."
"I have fallen in love."
"My prayers have been answered."
"Love is the dawn of the slumber of life."
"Love is a very beautiful punishment."
"I have fallen in love."
"My prayers have been answered."
"Come, let's go somewhere."
"Let's fly and go somewhere."
"Love is our sky."
"It is as open as our desires."
"An untouched feeling touched me."
"Like there is intoxication in the sky."
"I'm in love."
"I have fallen in love."
"My prayers have been answered."
"I have fallen in love."
"My prayers have been answered."
"My path tells this to me."
"Why don't you stray a little?"
"Now this journey is unique."
"Please ask my destination.."
"..to look out for my path from the shore."
"If you are with me.."
"..this journey is like a dream to me."
"My heart has been a bit troublesome."
"It has given me some beautiful problems."
"I have fallen in love."
"My prayers have been answered."
"Baby, I can see the sun rising in your eyes."
"Baby, every time I think of you, you make me smile."
"Baby, I'll never ever want to let you go."
"Never even in my dreams had I ever thought.."
"..that the God of desires would give me so much."

Maids.
- Yes, brother.
Where is everybody gone?
Brother..
Gone ashram.
Meeting Guru.
And Pooja?
- Gone.. with them too.
Why, brother?
Heart beating fasting?
Brother, where are you running?
Come on, come on.
- Come.
This is Guru's that.
What is it called..
As..
Ashram.
We've come here to fix a wedding date for your marriage with Prem.
Yes.
Let's go.
You go ahead.
We'll come.
- Okay.
Pooja, it is believed that all wishes..
Come.
Which Pooja are you talking about, Ram?
Pooja has not returned from her friend's wedding.
Then who is the one who has been staying..
..in our house as Pooja since the past few days.
Who is the scoundrel you ran away with?
Kill his entire family.
How is that possible!
You want me, right?
I'm ready to come with you.
Let's go.
Come on.
Leave me.
Brother-in-law.
Sanjana is not here.
I knew that you would surely come.
And I, too, knew that you would say..
.."I knew that you would surely come."
Why should I come, huh?
Am I your boyfriend?
I love you?
- Saw?
You are agreeing to it.
No.
Really?
He's your uncle?
Yes.
Prem, how would I tell you that..
..these goons, mafias are my maternal uncles?
Great.
Your family members are like Charles Shobraj and Ranja Billa?
I love these mafia people.
Stop joking, Prem.
You don't know how much my uncles hate each other
My mother's last wish was..
..that I get both my uncles' blessings at my wedding.
So that their enmity ends forever..
..and they become good human beings like they were, earlier.
But?
- The greed of attaining my property worth 200 crores..
..increased their enmity.
Each one of them wants me to marry his brother-in-law.
200 crores?
I can draw a cheque without deducting the TDS..
..and keep your uncles in my pocket.
But my dear, until there are obstacles in a love story..
..it is not called a love story.
What stories will we tell our children?
Look, a boyfriend gets scared of his girlfriend.
A girlfriend gets scared of a cockroach.
A cockroach gets scared of a mouse.
A mouse gets scared of a cat.
A cat gets scared of a dog.
And a dog gets scared of a man.
- And a man is scared of a woman.
- What?
Just like a villain..
gets scared of the hero.
Prem, let's go.
My uncle is here.
What now?
They will..
- Don't worry, dear.
Today, I'll predict your future.
You will get married to an innocent looking rogue.
That's me.
Now can I take some advantage?
By the way, the fitting of the Indian dress is very good.
"Ready..
I am ready for you.
Are you ready for me?"
"Are you ready for me?
Are you ready for me?"
"Are you ready for me?
I am ready for you."
Uncle, Yuvraj was forcefully..
I ran away from there.
Sit in the car.
They are drying out.
This boy is making me that.
That..
Irritate?
- No, not irritate.
That..
This..
This..
Emotional?
- Emotional is like this.
This..
- So?
He is making me this.
This.
This..
Crazy.
- Crazy.
- Crazy.
He is making crazy.
Crazy.
Crazy.
He lied to me.
That girl is not this but that.
What..
- Not Sanjana, Pooja.
Pooja.
Yes.
Yes.
What you are thinking of doing is not so easy.
They are dangerous.
- Yes.
They are dons.
I would've said the same had I been in your place.
But.. what would've you done had you been in my place?
Why don't you make him understand?
What should I tell him?
All I know is that Sanjana is a very nice girl.
And right now, she must be in trouble.
She must be in big trouble.
That's true, sister-in-law.
But there is no solution to this problem.
I have such a solution that I'll make the lives of both the dons, hell.
They have a common CA, who has done BA.
And his name..
What was his name?
Sounds like bully.
- Idli (a south Indian snack)?
Mulli (Raddish)?
Pulley.
- Talli (drunk)?
No, close.
Close.
Khuli (open)?
Khali?
Khali.
Balli.
Balidaan Bhardwaj.
Sakku, how many times will you call me?
I feel that you call me even when you dial a wrong number.
What do I do?
You have left the house with so much cash.
I'm feeling scared.
This isn't the first time I'm out with so much cash.
I do transactions worth millions, day and night.
All 500 and 1000 denomination bills..
..across the world knows Balidaan Bhardwaj.
Then?
- That's fine.
But what if a thief stabs you and robs you?
Sakku, are you concerned about me..
..or are you trying to kill me?
Hang up, Sakku.
I want two demands drafts made.
One of30 lakhs and the other of20 lakhs.
Take this.
My bag?
My bag!
Where did my bag go?
Where is my bag?
There was 50 lakhs in the bag.
Where did the bag go?
My bag.
My bag got stolen.
Have you seen a thief here?
- No.
You blind man, you didn't see the thief?
.
You didn't even see such a big bag?
I didn't see it.
I'm not the owner of it.
You..
Have you seen your face?
It's so black that if shown on National Television..
..it will ward off evil from the entire country.
Sakku, what you said came true.
Sakku.
What happened?
Amar Chaudhary and Suraj Chaudhary's 50 lakhs got stolen.
What?
Don't do this.
Pack the bags.
It's time to leave the city.
Come on.
- Yes.
They are here.
Tell them I am not here.
I'll go and hide myself.
Mr. Bhardwaj.
Mr. Bhardwaj.
He has not only left this house but this world as well.
A trunk ran over him.
- Oh, no.
He got crushed.
Do you have anyone to look after you in this cruel world?
No.
By the way, I had brought this bag for him.
What will I do of this briefcase when he is no more?
Don't worry.
I'll take care of both his belongings.
Okay?
Let's meet after his final rites.
Bring it here.
Where are you going?
You are alive, sir?
- Yes, I'm alive.
It's her hobby.
She kills her husband over everything.
Start wearing a wedding chain from tomorrow.
People get mistaken.
She is mine.
And.. this bag is also mine.
There are only 50 lakhs in it, right, sir?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
There are only 50 lakhs..
Just a minute.
How did you come to know that there are 50 lakhs in it?
Just be looking at the bundle of the notes..
..I can predict how many notes it contains.
How?
- I learnt this art from my master.
Mr. B. B., sir.
Bishan Singh Bedi?
- No, sir.
Then?
Balibhrambhat.
- No, no, sir.
Bichun Bhutia.
Goal.
No way, sir.
The one who has written this book.
Mr. Balidaan Bhardwaj.
Be careful, sir.
I've written a book?
When did I write this book?
Such a fat book?
You?
- Yes.
Look at this.
The Balidaan in front of Bhardwaj is me.
That's me.
This is a sign of a genius.
You wrote a book and you don't even remember.
Sir, this book is a missile and you are an example..
..for a newcomer like me.
I have come to this city to be your assistant, sir.
I see.
- I want to learn the ropes of this job with you.
I don't want any money either.
- Then my job is done.
I mean your job is done.
- Thank you, sir.
I have only two clients.
Amar Chaudhary and Suraj Chaudhary.
Sir, they are mafias.
One is a mongoose.
And the other one is a snake.
If they get together then they are killer sharks.
But both of them are illiterates.
How many times during a year do you think..
..people like Chaudhary must be paying their taxes?
Sir, they must not even be paying the taxi fare.
Sir..
I make them pay tax every month.
Every month?
Again and again.
- Again and again.
12 times.
- 12 times.
Yes.
What do I do?
It is dirty but it is my business.
It is your business.
This is the only way to teach a lesson to those goons.
Sir, your name is Balidaan but you are making your clients sacrifice.
Now that you have joined me..
..everyone will be sacrificed..
with Prem (love).
Come with us.
Come with us.
- Why are you hitting me?
Come with us.
Come with us.
- Why are you hitting me?
Hit him.
Stop.
Stop.
Don't hit me.
Stop.
Stop.
I am your teacher, Amar Chaudhary.
Teacher?
You are a cheater, you scoundrel.
You give me a zero in the exams.
You gave the wrong answer.
What was the question?
Who is the president of India?
- Mrs. Prathiba Patil.
You had said that it was Abdul Kallam.
The president got changed.
It is my fault that the president got changed?
What do I have to do with when and where Alexander fought Porus?
Do I have to go there and dig their graves?
Hit him.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Well done.
You are doing well, Amar Chaudhary.
Saw that?
That's why I named him after me.
Amar Chaudhary.
Hey, Amar Chaudhary!
You stinky insect of a dirty sewer?
Mother, you go inside.
- Stop barking, you dog.
And let him go.
Otherwise I'll poison your food and feed you.
Got it?
Hey, go.
Take him back with dignity.
Go.
Yes.
- Go.
Let's go, sir.
Grandpa, you are being abused under his pretext.
No, no.
It's not so.
You are like a father to my daughter-in-law.
You are God.
A born leech.
- What?
He is.
This Amar Chaudhary.
It's time for school.
Don't you have to go?
Father, should I get something for you?
Yes, daughter-in-law.
Get some tea for me.
Okay.
- Without sugar.
And without poison.
Have some sweets, Mr. Chaudhary.
I got the land for your liquor factory cleared.
And it hardly cost you anything.
Only 50 lakhs.
Balli.
- Yes.
Don't you know you cannot bring strangers in here?
Who is he?
- He's my nephew.
Nephew?
- Yes, look.
We look similar, don't we?
You mean when I am of your age I will look like you?
Forget about the face, Mr. Chaudhary.
Talk about brains.
He is from America.
He will show your income so less..
..that you won't need to pay tax.
- Really?
You know the billionaire in America?
K.K. Modi.
He used to handle his account.
K. K. Modi?
- K. K. Modi?
Forget it.
Forget K. K. Modi.
Now that you are here you work for Mr. Chaudhary.
Handle his account.
Hire you nephew.
- Nephew!
Grandpa, it sounds like your business.
Ganja.
Balli.
- Yes?
You didn't teach your nephew how to salute?
Salute me.
What to get thrashed?
What did you say?
- No.
I saw my horoscope in the morning.
Yes.
- In it it's written that if I salute..
..anyone younger than me today..
..then he will get thrashed all day long.
But still if you want..
- No, no.
Let it be.
But I have read his horoscope.
Balli.
Come on.
- Let it be, today.
My nephew is with me.
So..
Balli.
Yes.
Now my hands feel warmer.
The apple of my eye.
My brave boy.
- Wild hippo, Amar Chaudhary.
Write 'Welcome' on your face.
You will look like a rotten doormat.
Anyway, your ponytail looks like a dead dog's tail.
Look at your grandpa.
It suits him so well.
Take this.
Stupid.
Go to school.
Yes, grandpa.
This is the first time mother has said the right thing.
The girls in my class tease me.
They said it looks like theirs.
With your permission can I chop it off?
.
Amar Chaudhary, you can have your neck cut but not your ponytail.
This is a warning, not advice.
We are samurais.
This is the identity of our family.
Your I.D. proof.
It is a voter's card, pan card.
Your blood group.
A proof that you are his grandson and he is your grandpa.
Where did this boring old man come from?
Great grandpa.
I saw you.
Today my day will go well.
Concentrate on your studies.
Kids of your age have gone places.
People of your age as well..
..have gone places.
"Happy days are over."
"Now I'm surrounded with sadness."
What is this, Mr. Lehri?
What are you doing?
I'm having black coffee with Obama in the White House.
Can't you see?
I hit the brakes to give you a lift.
Now my shirt has turned into a mop.
All this happened because of me, right?
I'm feeling very guilty.
I love you too.
Now it is my duty to get you out of here.
I also want to leave.
Because if my children grow up they won't recognize me.
And my wife is so nave that the poor thing..
..might once again run away with someone.
No such thing will happen because I have a mind-blowing idea.
This is the boy with whom Sanjana ran away, sir.
He doesn't look like he is from our city.
I'll find him even if he is hiding underground.
Are you telling the truth?
Sir, if I am lying he should die immediately.
No, I take his oath and say that henceforth..
..that that boy was not him but someone else.
Sir.
- What happened?
Sir, someone has come to meet you.
Balli, you got the land cleared for Amar for his liquor factory?
I just got the land cleared for him.
But for you along with the land I also got..
..the license for the liquor factory cleared.
Lehri, go.
You are free to go.
Mr. Chaudhary, I am leaving but before leaving..
..I would like to give you a warning.
Sir, this boy is very smart.
Only I know how he traps people.
You won't be able to anything to him..
..even if he comes and stands before you.
You do one thing.
You keep cleaning cars here till Sanjana's marriage.
Sir, what are you saying?
Sir, this is a crime.
It's a sin.
Mr. Chaudhary, you cannot do this.
Mr. Chaudhary can do anything.
He is Justice Chaudhary.
He provides justice to good people.
And he clears out the bad people.
Pick him and throw him out.
Balli, who is this boy?
He is a con.
C-O-N.
Con.
He joined hands with that girl and fooled me.
Which animal have I left out?
- You dog, clean the car.
Mr. Chaudhary, isn't the boy useful?
Once I start working, there will be no income and no tax.
No income tax.
But Balli, how is this possible?
This boy will work for Amar as well as us.
He has a habit..
..of doing two things together.
You know K.K. Modi in America?
He used to also handle his younger brother S.K. Modi's account.
But what if he turns out to be bad?
Then you can behead my uncle.
Behead me?
- Saw?
He agrees to it.
The thumb impression on the file.
Take it.
Just a minute.
Uncle, I was casually checking your accounts.
There are a lot of discrepancies.
What?
- There must be a slight difference.
21.
- 21..
Balli.
There is a difference of Rs.21.
Rs.21, dear?
It's hardly a difference.
Just a minute, uncle.
You are his assistant, right?
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on, show me the accounts.
Uncle, I'll go and check the accounts properly.
Yes, yes.
Okay, dear.
Hey..
Persuade her.
- Consider it done.
Balli, you saw how my niece's education is benefiting me?
Prem, this is not the right situation to take advantage.
Really?
Then promise me that you will meet me tonight.
And you will let me take all the advantages.
- Prem.
You..
You okay?
- Yes.
I was justjoking.
Balli, why do you look as if you've seen a ghost?
Our future daughter-in-law is checking everything, right?
Yes.
In detail.
Come with me.
Come with me.
Let them work.
Saw that?
My future wife is no ordinary girl.
Yes, I just came to know.
She has taken after me deceased sister.
So, your sister was also like her?
Then the entire family..
What happened?
He is getting scared.
- He fears he might get caught.
Sanjana..
Sanjana is not my daughter.
She is more than a daughter to me, Prem.
Her happiness means everything to me.
But..
But you don't know her uncles.
But..
But you don't know her uncles.
They..
- I know.
They are rogues from the Neanderthal times.
Orthodox.
I am a modern age dog.
Latest.
When we will fight, I will eat them up.
"I am a dog and she is my partner."
"I tell the truth, when she came.."
"..there came a season to eat everyone up."
Stop it.
Look, aunt, everything will be fine.
I promise.
What were you doing inside?
All that cuddling and all?
Uncle, she fell over me.
Girls from affluent families..
Hello.
Girls from affluent families are like that.
Try to understand.
Whether she falls on you or you fall on her..
..our necks will get cut and fall down.
Uncle, you only asked me to persuade her.
I got persuaded.
You would've got exposed..
..if she would've opened the accounts.
This is the first time I have let a girl touch me and you..
No, no.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
You are my disciple.
Come on, get in.
Get in.
Let's go.
Let's go.
"In 12 months I'll express my love to you in 12 different ways."
"Now I think I won't be able to survive.."
"..even for 12 minutes without you."
"When the winter season starts in January."
"We will switch on the heater of love."
"In a blanket as small as February.."
"..we will play hide and seek."
"March will be a romantic month."
"We'll do something we have never done before."
"What if we aren't able to meet in April?"
"What will happen?
Find a solution."
"I'll get an internet connection so that I can chat with you."
"When the summer season starts in May.."
"..we will party at the poolside."
"We will take a long vacation in June."
"We will go to a hill station."
"When starts raining in July.."
"..
I'll yearn to embrace you."
"We will have a lot of fun in August."
"We will make some arrangements."
"I'll take you to London.
I'll give you a tour of Paris."
"I'll take you on a world tour."
"I feel that I'll be coming often to your house in September."
"We'll see the sunsets together in October."
"You can keep your head on my shoulders."
"By the time the wretch November comes.."
"..you would've already surrendered your heart."
"Things will get confirmed on 12th December."
"With the confirmation from our hearts."
"There will be no car or mare."
"I'll bring the wedding procession on foot."
"In 12 months I'll express my love to you in 12 different ways."
"Now I think I won't be able to survive.."
"..even for 12 minutes without you."
Prem hasn't come as yet, dear.
Don't worry, aunt.
He will surely come.
Why don't you go and pay your respects..
..as you have come to the temple, Junior Chaudhary?
Tell me.
I prayed for a week before my exams.
He failed me.
- Then why have you come here?
I'm my grandpa's junior spy.
Whenever any female in the family goes out of the house..
..I keep an eye on them.
Whether they are going and meeting our enemies.
Aunt.
Go.
My child.
Bless you.
- That's enough.
Bless you.
Sister.
Someone stop them.
You are crying?
They are bound to cry.
These sisters-in-law love each other more than their own sister.
In spite of living in the same city we have met after ages.
Our men our fighting and we women are suffering.
I wonder when this will end.
Like I have united the aunts I will unite the uncles as well.
If I don't turn this family into a 'Hum Aapke Hain Kyon' family..
..then don't call me Prem.
Thank you.
Okay, so you are befriending our enemies..
..in the pretext of praying and worshiping?
Son, she isn't an enemy.
She is your grandaunt.
Amar, my child.
- Don't touch me, you old woman.
Scoundrel, if you say a word more..
..I'll feed you kerosene and light a match in front of your mouth.
Get out of here.
Forgive him, sister.
His grandfather has made him just like him.
I wonder when he will mend his ways.
Why are you laughing?
He will change, but I'm laughing..
..thinking of the way in which he will change.
Junior Chaudhary, the park is closed.
It's closed for others, not me.
Go and tell the manager, Amar Chaudhary is here.
The park will remain open.
Okay, sir.
- Okay, sir.
Come here, you animal.
Salute me.
The park should be closed now.
We have to go home.
You are refusing Amar Chaudhary?
Come here.
How dare you!
I won't spare you.
Go.
Who..
Who are you?
Badman.
Badman?
- Yes.
I'm here to turn a bad boy like you into a good boy.
You..
One kick and from Badman you will become a dead man.
Kick me.
Kick me.
Kick me.
Really?
Here you go.
Darn him.
I am sorry, bad-man.
Spare me.
Forgive me.
Okay.
From today, you'll be a good boy.
Yes, I will.
You won't bunk school.
- Okay.
You won't trouble your teachers.
You'll always respect your elders.
And you will cut your ponytail as well.
- Yes.
No, no.
This is not possible.
It is the identity of my family.
Shut up.
The kid has tired me.
First try to talk things out.
If they don't understand then kick them.
Great, Balli.
Great.
Your nephew is one in a million.
Amar Chaudhary.
Why do you have bandana on your head?
It's the latest fashion, grandpa.
Okay.
Okay.
Fashion.
Come here, my tiger.
And hit on this jackal's head.
Bless me, uncle Balli.
What are you doing?
Respecting my elders, grandfather.
This is what Badman has taught us.
Who Badman?
- He is our new teacher, grandpa.
Teacher?
Grandpa, his new teacher is Prem.
Dear, now I feel he'll also bring my two scoundrels back on track.
Hello
Uncle, uncle Suraj is once again trying to get me married to Veer.
What?
- Yes.
But I want to marry your son, Yuvraj.
Yuvraj?
- Please, uncle.
Please, do something.
Please, quickly get me out of here.
Someone is coming.
Come on, get the cars out.
Load your guns.
Let there be bloodshed?
We will have to bring Sanjana at any cost by this evening.
What are you doing, Chaudhary..
Sir.
Uncle, tell them.
What you are doing is wrong.
You are going to kill your brother for 200 crores?
Whereas someone worth 500 crores is in uncle's pocket.
Who are you talking about?
Uncle, I'm talking about K.K Modi.
Yes.
K.K. Modi from America.
Tell them how much he is worth.
He is worth 5000-7000 crores.
And hear this.
You know who has been given..
..the responsibility of getting his daughter Naina married?
Uncle.
Uncle, you couldn't see this gem of a person?
Whereas Naina desires a gem of a person.
They are such lovely people.
They are romantic.
They are going to kill their brothers.
Uncle, if I wouldn't have thought of this..
..then there would've been a bloodshed today.
Why don't you think?
No, the idea was on the way in my mind..
..but because of traffic..
Get this straight, Balli.
If we don't get this alliance then consider yourself death.
Get out of here.
I took K.K. Modi's name just like that.
You added his daughter to the story.
You added the responsibility of her marriage.
You added all the spices.
Sir, you told me all this..
after having a few drinks.
I told you about people who don't exist?
They exist, sir.
Listen.
- Yes?
Some K.K. Modi has called five times since morning.
He told me to remind you that he is coming..
..to India on Friday to discuss his daughter's wedding.
And yes, he has asked to book some resort.
Don't forget.
How is this possible?
Sir, this means you either have MP or UP.
Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh?
MP means memory power.
- Okay.
Sir, in this illness the battery of memory conks off.
Or UP that is unbelievable power.
Unbelievable power.
- Yes, sir.
In this the characters you think about come in real life.
I don't believe this.
That's why it is called unbelievable power.
Now you have to decide whether..
..it's your effective thinking or defective disease.
Meanwhile, sir, you have thrown me out of the house.
Bye.
Taxi!
- No, Prem.
I said that as I was worried.
Please.
Okay.
- Don't leave me in such confusion.
Okay, sir.
Tell me what I should do next.
There is no option or resort to this.
Yes, the last resort is that you book a resort.
Okay.
They have come?
Limo.
Ballu.
Ballu.
Uncle, go and welcome Modi.
What a pleasant surprise.
Come here.
Come here.
Give your friend a hug.
You have become fit.
I think it is the result of sister-in-law Shakuntala's that.
Love.
- Her love.
How is sister-in-law Sakku?
I hope you didn't have any that on the way.
What is it..
No, no.
One has to take some that for one's child.
Some..
Trouble.
- Yes, trouble.
Let's go.
Mr. Modi.
- Mr. Modi.
Stop.
Is this a way to ask for donations?
Mr. Modi, he is Mr. Chaudhary.
Avery famous L in the city.
- Landlord?
- Landlord.
- Landlord.
Mr. Modi, welcome, welcome, welcome.
Welcome.
Uncle Modi.
Aunt Modi.
Balli works for us.
Okay, Balli knows you.
That means he is our that..
Guest.
- Guest.
Guest.
Call him tonight for..
- Drinks?
Dinner.
Dinner.
And that as well.
Let's go.
Why are you staring at them with your mouth open?
Have you seen them for the first time?
Anyone will give that reaction on seeing Mr. Modi.
Sir, if you are a mouse then he is a cat.
If you are a cat, he is a dog.
If you are a dog, he is a fox.
If you are a fox then he is a lion.
If you are lion then he is an elephant.
If you are an elephant then he is a dinosaur.
Dinosaur of business, sir.
For your own good, come on time for dinner.
Otherwise you are a donkey, sir.
Who is going anywhere?
I am here till night.
Yes.
- Yes.
Let's go.
What happened, uncle?
He met me with so much affection.
He gave me a hug as well.
But I couldn't recognize him.
Is it an illness or my imagination?
Both.
- Both?
One personality is ill.
It is the imagination of the other personality.
The first and the second personality clashed..
..with each other and resulted in the third personality.
Spilt personality.
The fourth personality will be suicidal personality.
You will feel like committing suicide, uncle.
You are right.
- No.
I feel like committing suicide.
- No.
Yes.
- Don't do it, uncle.
- Why?
You won't remember that you have committed suicide, uncle.
So what should I do?
Uncle, now you have only one option left.
What?
- Believe that your personality with imagination is right.
You know him.
He is K.K. Modi.
- You recognize him.
I'll have to.
Otherwise, I'll commit suicide..
..and I won't even remember it.
So what's the use?
He is K.K. Modi.
Mr. Modi, we are not as rich as you are.
But we are well respected in the city.
Great.
- Yes, sir.
They are decent people.
Really?
- They have a lot of cars and are cultured as well.
So brother, tell us, how much loan do you want?
No, sister-in-law, I am..
Balli, tell them.
- What should I say?
Uncle, with your permission can I tell them?
- Yes, please.
Mr. Modi, he is his brother-in-law.
Yuvraj.
He has studied till the 8th grade.
The 8th grade.
Raise two more fingers.
Yes, the 8th grade.
He has studied till the 8th grade.
So?
He wants to marry your daughter.
- What?
Brother Ballu, you have brought such an alliance?
Have you seen their faces?
They look as if they have just come out of a jungle.
Right.
Will their daughter marry into this illiterate family?
The Modis.
They don't have any sense of that.
Fashion.
Nor do they know how to that.
- Talk.
To talk.
They look like that.
That..
Ape-men.
- Ape-men.
If you weren't my friend I would have done that.
Shot.
- Shot you.
Let's go..
- Sumitra.
- Sumitra.
Let's go.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- Okay.
You ruined their mood.
- Shut up.
Shut up.
You..
I'll blow your head with you, you scoundrel.
You fool, he isn't a scoundrel, you are.
Do you know who are you messing with?
You can only make scrabbled-eggs from an egg.
Mr. Modi can turn scrabbled-eggs back to an egg.
You have spoilt the whole game.
But it's okay.
Uncle is here.
He will think of something.
What will I think of?
.
I am totally confused.
Will you tell us what this is all about?
Why have you made us all wear sunglasses?
Excuse me for my language, grandpa.
But what do these Modis think of themselves?
They have kept three conditions for the wedding.
I told them that I won't be able to look into your eyes..
..after telling you those conditions.
And you won't be able to look at each other after hearing them.
He said, "Here, make them wear these sunglasses.."
"..and tell them the conditions."
Tell us.
Tell us, what their conditions are.
Basically the Modis have made..
..the tent of Chaudhary's lives stand on three sticks.
Condition No. 1.
They don't like the way you dress.
What are you doing?
They say that you look like a C-Grade movie's villain.
How dare they!
This..
This is what uncle said.
How dare they!
- Yes.
Yes.
The Chaudharys will never change..
..their dressing sense for their 500 crores.
- Yes.
500..
- Crores.
Okay.
Okay.
We will wear up-to-date suits.
Yes.
- Yes.
Yes.
What is their second condition?
Their family is a joint family like in the movie 'Hum Aapke Hain Kyon'.
They all live together.
So is our family like in the movie 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham'?
We stay separately?
They have never seen you out on a lunch or a picnic..
..with your daughters and daughters-in-law.
- Enough.
They are womenfolk.
This tradition has been going on since ages.
This is what uncle said as well.
- What?
That the Chaudharys will never change their tradition for 500 crores.
Yes.
- 500 crores.
Fine.
Fine.
Listen.
Listen.
Henceforth, we'll all be together.
Tell me the third condition.
If I tell you the third condition then.. your pants will tear.
Pants?
- I am saying this.
I am saying this.
He had said something else.
Tell me the condition.
You'll have to cut it.
- What?
You'll have to cut your ponytail.
- No.
Even uncle yelled and said no.
- Yes.
Yes.
But what can we do?
They hold the trump card of 500 crores.
500 crores. 500 crores.
Cut them, Amar.
You can always grow them back.
But you don't often get a harvest worth 500 crores.
Great.
Now you are looking that and that.
Bold and beautiful.
- Bold and the beautiful.
So tell us, brother.
What have you decided?
What have I..
What do you say, Ballu?
Should I do that?
Yes?
- Do it.
Now that you have found a diamond..
..better set it in the ring.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Fine, then I'll call my daughter and younger that tomorrow.
Brother.
- Brother.
Okay.
- Do you have relatives or brothers or something like that?
No.
He has an elder brother..
Name?
- Suraj Chaudhary.
In spite of having an elder brother..
..you have come alone to fix the alliance?
Where is he?
How can he come here?
We don't get along.
A house where brothers don't that..
- Get along.
Get long.
Will their daughter go there?
- The Modis.
The Modis.
What he means is that their timings don't match.
He is sometimes out and he is sometimes in.
These two brothers love each other a lot.
Like..
Lord Rama and Laxman.
- Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So call them tonight.
Match the..
Timings.
- Timing.
Yes.
Consider it to be our that..
- Condition.
- Yes.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Don't hit my uncle.
What was the need to say..
- Sister-in-law, please, help.
That I have an elder brother?
I said it because you have one.
You could have said that he is dead.
You are strange.
How could say that?
Till date you haven't been able to kill him.
So uncle, how will you kill him?
But we are dead now.
That old man will never listen to us.
Hey, when God gave uncle a head over his shoulders..
..he didn't give it for decoration.
He will think.
He will think of something.
He will bring your brother by his ears.
Shut up.
Suraj Chaudhary will behead me even if I talk about it.
And if he doesn't come here then I'll behead you.
What?
Hey, let us go in.
Move aside.
Side.
Side.
Side.
- Who are you?
Keep distance.
Horn please.
May the face of the one with ill-intentions in his heart go black!
Seize the whole place.
Take everyone's mobiles.
Disconnect their phone.
Hey, who are you?
In this manner..
This is how we enter.
You have all the right to remain silent..
..as this is a raid.
I pay income tax thirteen times a year.
Yet there is a raid?
Sir, Ms. Sanjana.
Hello, uncle Mathur.
Hello, dear.
How are you?
Sanjana, you know these income-tax guys?
Aunt, they are not from the income-tax department.
They are from the World Bank.
I have heard of Punjab Bank and Allahabad Bank.
What is a World Bank?
The one outside Punjab and Allahabad is called World Bank.
The father of all banks.
And the mother of all banks.
Uncle and aunt of all banks.
But, sir, what are you doing here?
Ms. Sanjana's father had taken a loan of200 crores from our bank.
So?
- So he passed away before he could settle the loan.
So?
- He keeps on saying 'so'.
He will lose his mind when he will hear this.
So, we have seized all his property in America.
We have managed to get back 100 crores.
We still need to recover 100 crores.
But Sanjana doesn't hold any property here.
She came here to get married to me.
Fantastic.
After marriage a wife has equal right over the property.
Hence, according to law, we will recover 100 crores from you.
The bungalow itself must be worth 50-60 crores.
Come, let's go.
Let's go.
Mr. Lover, I knew that you would get this marriage canceled.
But what is this issue of100 crores?
Should I tell you everything today itself?
.
What's the rush?
Where are you going?
You are here.
Polish them.
Balli, what kind of a law is this?
The law is according to the place.
Uncle, including this house and other things..
..you will manage to arrange 100 crores, right?
You, too, wouldn't want my deceased father..
..to owe a loan to anyone, right?
Listen, assistant.
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on, let's check the value of the property.
Okay.
- Again?
No.
Actually I have some work with him.
Not now.
Okay?
Fine.
We will begin once your work is done.
Okay, ma'am.
How much work will you do?
You will get tired.
You..
- Everyone is standing here.
It's written in the scriptures, uncle..
..the more you work the better it is.
This girl will put me on streets to beg.
Now I got it.
Why did he break the alliance with this girl..
..and formed an alliance with K.K. Modi.
He knows that this girl has a loan over her head.
Balli.
- Yes.
Instead of us, you got K.K. Modi's daughter..
..alliance fixed into Amar's family.
If he has ruined it, he will mend it.
How?
- How?
You know B.K. Modi.
- Who is B.K. Modi?
You only had said that K.K. Modi has a younger brother.
Yes.
Yes.
He does.
He does.
K.K. Modi has a younger brother.
But what about him?
- His money.
What about his money?
You only had said..
- What?
That he is richer..
..than his elder brother when it comes to money.
Yes.
Yes.
I said so.
But what about him?
- His daughter.
Daughter.
- Daughter.
His daughter's..
mother will also be there.
What about his daughter?
You had taken the responsibility of getting her married.
Wow, Balli.
No matter what you say that's a great condition.
Not condition, connection.
- Whatever.
But tell him Mr. Modi's conditions.
Yes, ma'am.
Coming.
I'll go and check the property.
I'll see how much worth it is.
Darling Balli, what conditions do these Modis have?
"Forgot tradition and became ready."
"If they get it right they will make it big."
"Money can make you do anything."
Amar!
- Brother!
Brother!
Where is your party?
Has gone to pickup your party at the airport.
Where did she come from?
Did you call her?
It feels very nice to see the two of you together today, uncle.
Now my problem is also over.
Now both of you decide who I should marry.
Dear, you should forget Veer.
Last night your mother visited me in my dreams.
And she said, "Veer isn't good enough for my Sanjana."
So the confusion is over.
I will get married to Yuvraj.
No, no, no, no, no, dear.
Yuvraj is absolutely useless.
Your mother visited me in my dreams as well.
She started crying.
She said, "Brother, don't ruin my Sanjana's life.
More tears.
What about me?
Will I stay single all my life?
- Not at all, dear.
We, your uncles are there for you.
We will find someone good enough for you.
Nice, capable and decent.
We will have a grand wedding for you.
Why do you worry, dear?
We are there for you.
- Yes.
Okay, uncle.
Whatever you feel is right.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Meet him.
He's my younger brother..
- B.K..
B.K. Modi.
- Yes.
- Modi.
Look who it is.
Ballu.
How are you, Ballu?
Hi, B.K. How are you?
You look fit.
I think sister-in-law's love has played its trick.
How is sister-in-law, Sakku?
She's absolutely fine.
She keeps talking about all of you.
How is B.K?
What is he doing these days?
That's fine.
Mr. Modi, the girls didn't come with you?
To hell with the girls.
- What?
- What?
He means say hello to Naina and Sunaina.
Yes, they are the apple of their mothers' eyes.
Naina.
- Sunaina.
They both are great, aren't they?
Walk straight.
What are you thinking about, uncle?
What are you thinking about?
I couldn't recognize the other Modi as well.
Uncle, this means it's not an illness but an imagination.
You mean the character I think about, comes to life?
Yes.
You have the power.
Otherwise, how is it possible, uncle.
What will we call a person with such imagination?
We cannot call him human.
You mean I am..
God?
Brahma.
The Creator.
The creator of the universe.
Balli.
Balli.
Look..
How they address God.
Idiots.
He has regained consciousness.
Now we will have fun.
Start that.
Mr. Chaudhary, he is out of coma, but he is unable to speak.
How can he not speak?
Son..
Tell me, who was he?
Speak up.
Tell me.
Who was he?
Tell me, son.
Try to speak.
Try.
Uncle, why is he pointing towards you?
Balli.
This means you..
No, sir.
I cannot even put a comma to sentence.
How can I put him into coma?
Mr. Chaudhary, your son is still not out of coma.
His mind is spinning hence he is moving his finger here and there.
Look, now he is pointing towards him.
Mr. Chaudhary, your son's condition is so bad..
..that he might even point his finger towards you.
Oh, my.
The son is pointing towards his father.
Please go out.
The patient is getting hyper.
Doctor, make my son get well soon.
Because the day he will come out of coma..
..someone else will go into coma.
Let's go.
Let's go.
There are so many sorrows in this world.
Your sorrow is so less.
You aren't able to say anything..
..because of your unconscious state.
And he cannot say anything even when he is conscious.
So sad is this and how bad is that.
Continue.
Sir.
No, sir.
Madam..
- Move back.
I don't care.
Please sir.
Sir, please.
- It's not my problem..
..as to with whom Mr. Chaudhary..
..is having his breakfast and his lunch.
Mr. Chaudhary, I've been looking for you all over the city.
And you are having fun over here.
You are having parties.
I'm being pressurized by the bank.
I keep getting phone calls.
Tell me what you want to do.
Mr. Modi, you are here?
What a pleasant surprise.
Hello, sister-in-law.
- Hello, brother.
Sister-in-law, it seems like you have come here on a holiday.
No, brother.
Our daughters are getting that with the brothers-in-law.
They are getting married with the brothers-in-law.
Mr. Suraj.
- Yes.
Your brother-in-law Veer was going to marry your niece, right?
No.
Niece?
Who is his niece?
Here she is.
Sanjana.
She is a very nice girl.
Why do you want to get related to us instead of her?
Actually, what happened was..
- For Sanjana's happiness.
Sanjana doesn't like Veer and that's why..
..Mr. Chaudhary cancelled the wedding.
Great people.
This is very that.
- Good.
- Good.
Avery good thing.
But brother, it's wrong as well.
Look brother, there is a young unmarried girl in their family.
And they are getting their brothers-in-law married.
It is wrong, isn't it?
True.
It is not so.
Mr. Chaudhary is looking for a suitable boy for her.
He will get her married as soon as he finds a suitable boy.
Take your time and find a boy.
We are here for four days.
Look, first Sanjana will get married then our daughters will.
But Mr. Modi..
- No ifs or buts.
Consider this to be our that.
- Condition.
- Our condition.
Yes.
- Another condition?
Don't worry.
All the four Chaudharys are charged.
They will do something in four days.
Great people.
People, everybody join me please.
"Whether you are a crescent or the moonlight."
"No matter what you are.."
"..
I swear on God, you are great."
Clap, everyone.
Great.
Great.
Brother, the Chaudharys might get a heart attack..
..listening to your conditions.
Brother has kept a condition ofSanjana's wedding.
- Yes.
But you'll have to give the idea that our Prem will be her groom.
Yes.
This condition has been kept to give this idea.
Okay.
But they are very dangerous people.
If they find out the truth..
There is one person who is very dangerous.
Lehri.
He is very smart.
But he has already said such a big lie..
..that now if he tells the truth, he will be the first one to die.
'Okay, so this is his family and not the Modi family.'
Mr. Balidaan.
Balidaan.
The poor thing is standing as a statue.
Fine, I will bring it into life.
Brother.
Brother.
Brother.
I have come here to tell you a secret.
Here he is.
Here he is.
You are doing pushups?
No, I'm pushing the ground down.
Keep quiet.
Keep quiet.
Tell me, who am I?
Am I God?
Am I a human being?
Who am I?
You are the first God with has been made by this human being.
What not have you made me?
Now even I have forgotten who I am.
I have become the Aamir Khan in the movie 'Gajani'.
Look here.
Look at this.
You have no idea how difficult it is to write on your back!
Rascal.
You played such a big game with a genius like me..
..who has written such a famous book?
Give me the book, please.
Here you go, genius.
I won't let you win as long as I am alive.
What will I do?
Mr. Balli, Mr. Chaudhary is calling you.
Go.
You have been summoned.
Yes.
Yes, I've put the ball in the hole.
I've learnt to play golf.
This is how we used to play marbles as well.
You are right.
- Greetings, sir.
Come.
Come, Mr. Balidaan.
Come.
You summoned me?
We have known each other since ages.
Why don't we turn this acquaintance into a relationship?
I didn't get you.
Your nephew Prem and our niece Sanjana.
Let's get them married.
- No.
No, this marriage cannot take place.
Why not?
You are a servant.
We are your employer.
You don't like the respect we are giving you?
Hello.
Why cannot this marriage take place, uncle?
We are their loyal servants.
We have to pay them back in someway or the other.
Right, uncle?
- Don't touch me.
You see, the girl has a loan of100 crores over her head.
That too of the World Bank.
Who will pay it back?
You?
We will pay it back.
We are going to get millions from the Modis.
You can keep 100-125 out of it.
Not 125, only 100 crores.
The amount of the loan.
After that even if you sent your daughter..
..without any clothes on, we will accept her.
Great.
Right, uncle?
We accept it, don't we?
- Yes.
Sanjana, my child..
I accept this match, uncle.
Uncle, your teeth will break if you will grind them so hard.
Mr. Chaudhary, there is a problem.
This Lehri keeps saying that Sanjana..
..had eloped with a boy during her wedding.
If someone comes to know about it on my wedding day..
..then my uncle will be defamed.
Can you please take care of this Lehri, sir?
Go and find Lehri.
Get him here.
Yes, Mr. Chaudhary?
Who eloped with Sanjana?
- This..
What is this that you are asking me?
I had shown you the photograph.
A lie.
You are lying.
He had eloped with Sanjana.
You are right.
He had eloped with her.
Forgive me, I had lied.
He is the one I had given a lift to.
Henceforth, this is what you should tell everyone.
Got it?
Are you happy now, Prem?
Yes, Mr. Chaudhary.
Mr. Lehri, you don't know what a big favour..
..you have done to my uncle and the Chaudhary family.
God will surely send you to heaven.
Congratulations, Balli.
You became their that.
What is it?
Yes, their relative.
Mr. Modi, you are the one who gave us this idea.
Otherwise, how could we ever think of this?
Have this.
Why did you unnecessarily take the that.
Trouble.
You go and have your meal.
We'll all have together.
No, we don't know how long we will take.
Why should you stay that because of us?
Hungry.
Go, have your meal.
Okay.
- I love you.
That's great, Mr. Modi.
At your place the women eat before the men do.
At our place, till we do eat, the women will die but..
..not touch the food.
This is wrong.
Look, women live in a very that world.
Small.
It begins from and ends at us.
The house and kids.
She is that in them.
What is it said?
Yes, restricted.
Hence it is our duty to look after them.
We should love them.
We should always keep them that.
We should keep them happy.
Radhika..
What happened?
Nothing.
You have your meal.
Before you?
So what?
If I drink all night along..
..will you stay hungry till the morning?
What is wrong with you, today?
Love.
I love you.
Sorry.
Shalu.
Shalu?
- Yes, Shalani.
Now I will always call you Shalu.
And henceforth, you can eat before me.
Why so?
- Because I love you.
Thank you.
Brother, Prem is nowhere to be seen.
Sanjana is not here either.
They got what they wanted.
The lovebirds must be busy at some corner.
Yes, so what is wrong in that?
They both that to each other.
They love each other.
They are going to get married.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Come, let's go and have some food.
Come on.
Look, Prem and Sanjana are also back.
Come on.
The bride and the groom are also here.
Let me make an announcement.
I have decided that this marriage won't take place.
What?
What?
Once again uncle must have gone into the 100 crore loop..
..after having a little too much to drink.
Balli, what are you saying?
Keep quiet.
Keep quiet.
You are saying Balli and sacrificing me
This marriage won't take place.
If uncle doesn't want this marriage to take place then..
Without uncle, I don't want to marry like an orphan.
Since when did you become an orphan, you liar?
Here he is.
Your father is here in a three-piece suit.
He is here.
Fine.
Fine.
Fine, Ballu.
If you are breaking your that with him.
Then I will form a that with him.
What is it?
Yes, a relationship.
Henceforth, I am your father.
And I am your mother.
I'm your uncle.
I'm your aunt.
If you are falling short of relatives then I, too, shall become one?
Why..
Why would you become anyone?
You are his uncle.
Keep it fixed.
Then it is fixed.
- Yes.
Henceforth, I am his uncle.
- And I am his aunt.
Look at that.
They all are telling the truth.
Chaudharys, can't you see the truth?
Brother.
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't do this.
Don't do this.
No matter how he is, he is my uncle.
My real uncle.
I'll make him understand.
Uncle, you saw how many relatives I have now?
It won't make a difference if I have one uncle less.
Yes, uncle.
On one hand your final rites will be performed..
..and on the other my wedding ceremony.
Correct.
- But this wedding will surely take place.
Yes, so I will prepare for the wedding.
- Yes.

By the way, Prem..
- Yes?
Have you come here to show the necklace..
..your family has bought for her or to see Sanjana?
I had come to congratulate all of you.
This is the first love marriage taking place in your family.
Yes, of course.
Aryan.
You came from the hospital on the right day.
Come, I'll introduce you to Sanjana's future husband.
Don't you want to get ready?
- Ready?
Come on, go.
Go.
- I am ever ready.
Ask Sanjana.
Prem.
Prem, look who is here.
He is the one.
He is the one who hit me with his car.
I went into coma because of him.
He was the one who eloped with Sanjana.
Look, Veer, Yuvraj.
Sanjana and Prem love each other.
That means everyone is a part of Prem's conspiracy.
I'll take care of you later, you wrenched woman.
We will first..
..take care of you.
You are flying too high.
Do you love to fly?
Yes, we do.
- What will you do?
Nothing, boys.
I'll just help you fulfil your dream.
You..
Where shall I keep it?
We will have to tell brother-in-law about his true identity.
Fools, not the true identity, but a false one.
Never underestimate three things in life.
I, me and myself.
Thank you.
No one can deport the one who has the family's support.
I am someone who can drown a fish.
What can you three.. do to me?
Go, Veer.
Go, Yuvraj.
I'll see how he stops you.
Let's go.
You are sleeping even after coming out of coma?
Do you remember your name?
Aryan.
- Aryan, go into flashback.
And see what I had done to you.
Where did he go?
He left right in front of you.
Mr. Modi.
- Yes.
Mr. Modi.
- What happened?
Mr. Modi.
- What happened?
We know the truth about that scoundrel Prem.
He is not Balli's nephew.
So?
- He isn't the real Modi either.
He is my real uncle.
A Kapoor.
Uncle.
- Yes, nephew.
Uncle.
- Uncle, catch them.
We'll see you.
- We'll see you.
Prem, I'll go with you.
- You handle the ladies inside.
I'm a Modi.
I'm a Modi.
I'm a Modi.
Aryan.
Aryan, let's go.
Save us.
Save us.
One.. two.. three.
The keys.
The keys are with me.
Take it.
Come here..
Come here..
That way.
That way.
Side effects of too much rajma chawal (a rice dish).
Sorry.
O God!
Card.
Card.
- Thank you.
Call me.
No pee me.
Pee them.
Hey, stop peeing there.
Stop him.
Stop him.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Stop there.
Let's go fast.
You are a dead man.
We won't spare you.
What's this new drama.
Bye-bye!
Amar.
Sanjana reminds me of our sister Shibani today.
Yes, brother.
Our Sanjana looks so happy.
I'm ready to go to the moon for her.
What?
Uncle, looking at her I feel that I won't even need..
..the almond flavoured milk.
Dad.
You know there is a that.
A custom.
Yes, but till date I've never got that of that custom.
A need.
You, too?
- Yes.
Stop this wedding.
Dear good people, someone stop them.
Aryan, you are back from the hospital.
But who did this to you?
That beguiler, Prem.
We have been cheated in such a big way.
Why did you do this to us?
Why?
Mr. Chaudhary, this was Sanjana's mother's desire.
And there was a belief in her wish.
Her wish was that you two get Sanjana married..
..and give her your blessings.
And she believed that..
..you two brothers will unite because of this marriage.
That means you really made a fool out of us.
You cheated us with 500 crores.
That means he is not a Modi.
And they are your uncles.
Listen, you idiots.
That's what I've been telling you since so long.
But you didn't listen to me.
You didn't listen to me as well.
Then tell them now.
No, you only tell them.
God sent you down here but He forgot to give you any brains.
You didn't change even after seeing the goodness in him?
But I have changed.
From now on I will be a true uncle to Prem.
Let me see who tries to touch my nephew.
Come on.
Coming.
Here you go.
You will touch my nephew.
No, I am here to give you a hand, sir.
- Okay.
Sir, being with them till date I have only washed cars.
Being with you, I am sure I will thrash a person or two.
Great.
Great.
Come on, let's begin the thrashing.
We are the five good men..
..and you are the two evil uncles.
Hippo Amar Chaudhary, you will get crushed in their fight.
Come here.
Fools, what are you waiting for?
Shoot them all.
We have come to attend the wedding.
We support love and not hatred.
Prem has changed us.
By giving double the money.
Let's go, hired goons.
Traitors.
Prem, you continue.
It's inauspicious to stop that in the middle.
That.. that..
- The wedding vows.
The wedding vows.
The wedding vows.
Come on.
Let's go.
Priest, hurry up.
Otherwise, my father and the rest of them will get thrashed.
Come.
Can I hold it?
Shall I start walking?
Come on, son.
Priest, please hurry up.
I'll shut down your World Bank.
Fast.
Fast.
I'm safe.
No.
This will be fine, Choudhary.
This is too much.
Prem, you can get another wife..
..but you won't get another father.
Today, for the first time a woman has said something sensible.
Go, Prem.
Prem, you won't get a better chance to remove your shirt.
Show your body.
- I won't.
Why?
- He has become fat.
Fat.
What shall I say?
Enjoyed it?
Mr. Chaudhary, I am here to form relations..
..and not to break bones.
Anyway, at our place we don't even look into the eyes of senior citizens.
Raising a hand on them is a farfetched thing.
Hence, chill and relax, Mr. Chaudhary.
Chill and relax.
Saw that?
This is what is called good values.
But are miles away from it.
Yes, you only know the meaning of greed..
..selfishness and deception.
You didn't even bother about my mother, you deceased sister.
How low will you stoop for money?
My child is absolutely right.
On one hand this boy is making sacrifices for his future wife.
And on the other it's you guys..
..who since ages have been making your wives sacrifice.
I'm feeling ashamed..
..to call both of you my sons.
Shame on you.
Disgusting.
Hey old man, have you lost your mind.
Father.
Get up, father.
Father..
Don't you dare!
He is our father.
I will cut your hand if you even touch him.
And I will break your jaw if you misbehave with him.
He lied.
He cheated everyone.
And you are..
They aren't even Modis.
What difference does the name make, son?
A person is known for his deeds.
And then, when have we ever acted like Chaudharys?
We have instead demeaned the Chaudhary name.
They are the real Chaudharys.
No, we are very satisfied being Kapoors.
How can he be a Chaudhary?
He has made us fight.
Brother-in-law, we should take revenge from him.
Revenge for what?
We should seek revenge because he made us human?
We should seek revenge because..
..by changing relations he changed us.
We brothers have been enemies since ages.
But today when our father got hurt our hearts felt the pain.
Should we seek revenge for that?
We should learn from this family.
Just being a part of a family doesn't make you a dear one.
A member is a dear one when you accept him.
Sir.
Sorry.
Sir..
We hold our ears and say..
..that we will never act like goons again.
And we will never be greedy for money.
And one more thing, sir.
Mr. Modi, what is your original surname.
Kapoor.
Kapoor.
- Mr. Kapoor, please forgive us.
And accept us.
Let us be a part of this wedding along with our girl, please.
Madam.
Chaudharys plus Kapoors equals to Chapoors.
Mrs. Chapoor.
Oh, my, Mrs. Chapoor.
Someone stop her.
Ready?
Ready!
One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Ready.

'My name is Prem.
I was introduced to you in the end.'
Hello, Mr. Aasim.
- Hello!
'This is my family.
The people you see on the screen right now..'
'The gentleman is my father.'
'And the lady is my mother.'
'My dad has a terrible habit of.. what was it again..'
'Yes, of forgetting things.
Come, I will show you the proof.'
You are that.
- That?
Welcome to the wedding.
- Yes.
Come inside and keep that.
The gift?
- That.
No, no, no, that.
That.
Please have a seat.
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.
Welcome.
Welcome.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Wow!
The steamed potatoes have no steam in them.
And there is no saffron in the saffron sweetmeat.
Really?
What really?
I was just tasting them.
Look, what happened with all the tasting that you've done.
'That's Prem's uncle, Laxman Kapoor.'
'And his wife, Kiran.'
"I love you.
I love you.
I love you."
What is it?
You are dancing with joy.
Why?
- You didn't dance so much at our wedding.
I'm celebrating someone else's joy.
That was a suicide.
- Suicide?
My joy.
Does anyone dancing when he is happy?
Not suicide.
'That's Prem's uncle, Bharat Kapoor.'
'And his wife, Suman.'
Look, brothers, if there is that at that then that will happen.
What that and that will happen?
If there is lack of anything at the wedding..
..then we will get defamed.
- Okay.
Okay.
Don't worry, brother..
- Everything will be fine.
- Sure?
'These three brothers love each other a lot, like Ram, Laxman and Bharat.'
'And co-incidentally their names are..'
'..
Ram, Laxman, Bharat.'
By the way, where is my that?
That?
[ Skipped item nr. 42 ]
It will ruin the wedding.
- No, it is taller than a bottle.
That..
That..
- The bride.
She is inside.
- Not the bride.
That..
That..
A child.
- How can there be a child when he is not married?
My child.
My child.
- His child.
Prem.
Prem.
Say that.
Where is that idiot?
- No, brother.
Don't call him an idiot.
This wedding is taking place because of him.
- Yes.
Khushi would have never agreed..
..if he wouldn't have reasoned it out with her.
- Right.
'Khaman Dhokla'.
- 'Khaman Dhokla'..
- Brother..
Gaurav had gone inside to meet Khushi for two minutes.
Half an hour has passed by.
Go and check what's happening.
The auspicious hour is passing by.
- Really?
'It is their friend and neighbour Mr. Pathak's daughter's wedding..'
'..whose name co-incidentally is Khushi.'
Khushi.
Khushi, my child.
Where are you?
Son-in-law.
Son-in-law.. what happened?
Who did all this?
Where is Khushi?
She ran away.
- She ran away?
She ran away with her lover.
- Lover?
Who is her lover?
Your neighbour, the Kapoors..
Their pampered, spoilt, rascal, scoundrel son.

The groom?
- He's ready as well.
Then sign here.
- Okay.
Thank you.
Take this.
Here you go.
Exchange the garlands.
You are now husband and wife.
Click a photograph.
Just a second.
Click it.
Click it.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I was not in town.
If you wouldn't have helped her run away..
..her father would have got her married to someone else.
Yes.
And I would have become someone else's wife.
Not a chance.
Here's my card.
You are a registrar here.
We know.
No, no, no.
This is my other card.
I'm also a divorce lawyer.
I've dissolved more marriages than I've performed.
And looking at the two of you I feel..
..that you will definitely need me in future.
I know love is blind.
But marriage makes everyone see things clearly.
Do you see things clearly?
I'm still blind.
I've already married thrice.
I'm waiting to get married for the fourth time.
What kind of a man is he?
- Thank you.
Let's go.
Let's go.
We don't want your card.
Sir.
Sir, at least take the card.
Sir..
Who is he?
- He was getting married to her.
Look, brother, she was being forcefully to marry you.
And that's why..
- Forget it.
I was being forced to marry her.
What?
- I had come to tell Khushi that I love Kiran.
But I didn't get a chance to talk.
I was hit with a stick on my head and I fell unconscious.
I won't spare you.
- Brother, no..
Stop it, Gaurav.
Stop it.
We should thank them.
- Yes.
We wouldn't be together if he wouldn't have helped Khushi elope.
Say thanks.
Kiran.
- Hi.
How are you?
Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
Hurry up, the two of you.
Come here and get married.
I have to go and get someone divorced.
Let's go.
It's time for our flight as well.
We'll make a move.
Thank you so much.
- See you.
Take care.
Brother Prem.
- What?
Brother Prem, everyone inside..
Pathak shitting petrol.
Shitting?
- Seating sofa.
Oh, seating.
- Yes.
Okay.
You parking bike.
I'm seeing how much shitting.
He is here.
He is here.
He is here.
I'll set myself on fire.
I'll kill myself.
This drama has been going on since last night.
Neither is he sleeping nor is he letting us sleep.
Whenever he dries a little he wets himself again with petrol.
Mr. Pathak, if you wish to set yourself on fire..
..please do so outside, in the garden.
Why are you burning our house with you?
- Quiet.
Yes, exactly.
You heard that?
You heard that?
After ruining my family he is talking about his house.
Daddy, why don't you dive and snatch it?
Shut up.
You have done that.
- Awrong thing.
Awrong thing.
Yes.
- Stay away.
Stay away.
Stay away.
I'll set myself on fire.
Brother..
- Stay away.
Stay away.
Stay away.
Brother, Khushi is notjust your daughter but his friend as well.
Yes.
- Yes.
I'm sure she must have seen something special in Raju.
I'm sure the day you see them happy, you will forgive them.
That day will never come in my life.
And there are hardly any days left in my life.
Perhaps not even one.
Yes.
He is right.
He is right, right?
Then keep this aside.
I'll commit suicide.
- You..
I'll commit suicide.
- Who are you threatening?
I'll help you.
Does anyone have a lighter?
No, I don't have it.
This lighter..
- You started smoking?
- You started smoking?
Shame on you.
- Brother, I didn't..
Don't change the topic.
What were you saying?
I'll help you deep fry.
What are you doing?
Prem?
- What is this?
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Prem?
Prem?
Prem?
- Will Mr. Pathak's death affect anyone of you?
No.
- No.
- Will the world end?
What..
What..
What..
I will burn him down.
Okay.
I won't spare you.
I won't spare you.
- Prem.
Prem.
You'll ruin everything.
- Prem.
Something has to be done about this boy.
Hello, Guru.
Hello.
- Come.
Come, Ram.
Have a seat.
Have a seat.
Look, Ram..
- Yes?
Prem has done a good deed by uniting two lovers.
Guru, he ended brother and Mr. Pathak's age old friendship.
Yes.
- Prem that's the talks of his marriage even before it starts.
What is it called?
- Ends.
- He ends it.
Last month Guru sent a dog to your place, right?
Yes.
She is very nice.
- Yes.
She keeps everyone happy.
- Yes.
He sent two maids for household chores.
Naina and Sunaina.
They are very nice girls.
But cannot get Prem married to them.
- Right.
Right.
Similarly, Guru has found a bride for Prem.
Ram, listen to me.
You know the Malhotras from America..
Yes.
- Their daughter is perfect for Prem.
Yes.
She is a Bandit Queen.
A Bandit Queen?
- A Bandit Queen?
Phoolan.
- Only her behavior.
She is very good at heart.
Her name is Pooja.
- Wonderful!
She is the only girl who can change Prem.
Guru, then why are you doing that in this?
Why are you delaying this?
- Why the delay?
She is coming to Bangkok tomorrow for her friend's wedding.
It will be great if Prem likes her.
Whether Prem likes her or not..
..only Pooja will come to our house as that.
What?
- A bride.
- A bride.
A bride.
- Yes.
Hello.
- Karan, I've been trying all six numbers of yours since so long.
Tell me what happened to the wedding.
I ran away from the wedding.
But my passport is with them.
What?
It'll take at least 10-15 days to make a new passport.
But what will I do in the meanwhile?
They will find me.
I'll call you later.
- Hello!
Hello!
Hi, Pooja.
Do you need a ride?
No, thank you.
Prem and his uncle are coming to fetch me.
Prem, Pooja is coming at Terminal 3..
..why are we standing at Terminal 7?
That's the game plan.
- Why are you throwing it?
How will Pooja recognize us?
That's what I want.
She shouldn't recognize us.
Why
What are you doing?
What is this..
This.. is a proof for my father that we went to the airport..
..but Pooja Malhotra didn't come here.
So we came here..
- Uncle, tell me one thing.
Neither you nor I have ever seen her.
Nor has anyone in the family has seen her.
Guru has sent an imported Pooja Malhotra from America..
..so that she marries me and changes me?
- Correct.
Uncle, I need a very impish, roguish and talented wife.
Impish, roguish and talented?
But nowadays it's so difficult to find..
..an impish, roguish and talented wife.
All of them are married.
I am there.
But what will tell our Guru?
Let the Guru's mother go to hell.
Does he have a sister?
- Yes.
Then we shall send both of them.
- Okay.
Both mother and sister will go to hell.
Prem.
Who called me Prem so hatefully?
What did you think?
I will wait for you at Terminal 3?
And you will click a photograph here..
,and fool father?
- Pooja.
How did you recognize us?
Not you, him.
Daddy had given his description when I was leaving America.
I scanned the entire airport.
He was the only rogue with an innocent face.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
What an image you have, Prem.
I'm proud of you.
Why are you in a wedding dress?
What did you think?
I'll come from America in a two-piece bikini?
It would've been better.
- Just shut up.
Come on!
Let's go.
Excuse me.
Don't take advantage of the situation.
And don't you dare touch me.
Let's go.
Wow.
Impish, roguish and talented.
I should have asked for something else, uncle.
What better could have you asked for?
Think about it.
Ayoung and old imp at home.
And they will bet on who is more impish.
Your aunt and she will get along well.
Truly.
I'll bet on your girl.
They are here.
Pooja is here.
Pooja is here.
Brother, is she Pooja?
Or has he brought some other girl from her wedding?
You all must be surprised, right?
Seeing me dressed as a bride.
You see, a girl looks her best in a wedding dress.
So, I told myself, "Pooja, don't take a chance."
"If you want to impress everyone.."
"..then go dressed as a bride.
- Very impressed."
Impish.
Okay, tell me, how did you like our Prem?
Yes.
How did you like you?
I liked all of you a lot.
Very talented.
And if all of you support me then..
..we will change him for good as well.
Talented also.
- Okay.
Then all of us are with you.
Come in.
Come in.
Come in.
- Come in, dear.
She will change him for good.
She didn't bring any bags with her.
What was the need to bring any luggage?
I'm not staying in a hotel.
I'm staying with my in-laws.
There is anything lacking in here?
Yes, only that like you was lacking.
That..
What?
- What do you call a son's that?
Daughter-in-law.
- We were only lacking a daughter-in-law..
..and now your presence has changed that as well.
Your father has become that.
- Mad?
Should I tell your father?
You are saying such things about my elder brother?
Yes?
Tell us, when are you going for the wedding?
I just ran from a wedding.
You ran away from it?
But you were going to Phuket for your friend's wedding, right?
Yes, I was going to.
What do you mean, "I was going to?"
If you didn't go there then how did you ran away from it?
By ran away I mean I got rid of it with great difficulty.
Why would I unnecessarily waste my time in Phuket?
That's right.
Why waste time in Phuket?
If I would attend my friend's wedding..
..then how would I make arrangements for my wedding?
And I have to fulfil the responsibility Guru has given me.
She will marry you.
She is wishful-serpent.
I will never let her wish come true.
Sir, Pooja's on the line.
Pooja?
- Pooja?
It's for Pooja.
Give it to me.
Hello.
Hi.
How are you?
I'm standing at the airport since the last two hours..
..and you are asking how are you?
I'm not okay, understand?
My friend.
The one who is getting married.
She is very angry.
Anyway, look, I am waiting at the airport, come on.
And he didn't come to pick me up.
- Didn't get the time.
I have come here from America and he didn't get the time?
If you don't believe me then talk to Prem's dad.
I?
- Dad, she is calling all of you.
Tell her that you all are not free.
- Yes.
Look, we cannot come.
We don't have that.
Tell her that we don't have a car.
- No, we have a car.
The thing that moves like this.
Pendulum.
- We don't have a pendulum.
Excuse me?
- Time.
No, we don't have time.
Sorry.
Heard that?
Now do you believe me?
If you don't have time then even I am not stupid..
..to waste my time for you over here.
I'm going to attend my friend's wedding.
And I'll go to Guru's ashram after 8-10 days.
If you finally have the time and you wish to meet me..
..then you can come there.
Understand?
Okay.
That's a great idea.
Bye.
Come, Pooja, I'll take you to the guestroom.
Aunt, am I a guest that I'll stay in the guest room?
I'll stay in Prem's room.
In Prem's room?
- Before this?
Before marriage?
Until we get married, Prem will stay in the guestroom.
Yes.
Don't worry about him.
He can also sleep on a table.
Look, he is sleeping.
Ma'am, if you want to stay then stay in the guestroom..
..otherwise, I'll make you disappear in such a way..
Prem.
- Daddy, my room..
Uncle, cool down.
Now I am here.
I'll handle it.
Now look here, my future husband.
For now, I have just snatched your room.
After that I'll snatch your sleep and peace of mind as well.
I'll make you empty.
Empty.
You..
- No abusing.
Come, aunt.
Show me my room.
Go.
Go.
Show it to her.
- I'll be right back.
Brother, she will set him straight.
Isn't she very delicate?
- She is a lizard.
A lizard.
I don't know where that girl is.
I'm telling the truth.
You lost her.
My men couldn't find her.
Where did she go?
She doesn't know anyone in the city.
And no one knows her.
Where can she go?
Where can she go?
Where?
Where?
Hit him.
I want her at any cost before Suraj Chaudhary to her.
Someone stop me.
She is one piece from head to toe.
How do I cut her into pieces?
Prem, control your mind.
I'll control my mind but..
This girl with a face that looks a mix of banana and mango..
If you scream this Rampuri dagger will take to straight to Lord Rama.
You are taking advantage of the situation.
Situation?
Advantage?
Again?
She will yak and force someone..
..to think about it even if he isn't in the mood.
But what will you gain by killing me?
The CEO of fools, I won't benefit from it, you will.
I'll double your value.
- What?
How much is a live chicken worth?
- Rs.100.
And how much is a Tandoori chicken worth?
- 200.
So doesn't that double the value after death?
You will snatch my peace of mind?
You will snatch my room?
If you don't leave by tomorrow morning..
..then I swear by Baba Ramdev..
..I will kill you.
What happened?
- What happened, dear?
What happened?
- What happened?
What happened?
She must have had a nightmare.
She must have screamed.
A lot can happen in a nightmare.
Like..
Yes, a sneeze.
I was dreaming?
- Look, she is agreeing.
Come on, go back to sleep.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- She was dreaming.
Let us know if you need anything.
- Let's go.
Okay, goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Never underestimate three things in life.
Shucks..
Me, me and me.
Now you only bloody decide whether..
..you have to come to this house in a palanguin..
..or you want to leave this house.. as a dead person.
"Oh, Lord of the whole universe."
"Mighty Lord of the whole universe."
"All Thy devotees' agonies.."
"All Thy devotees' sorrows.."
"Instantly Thou banish."
"Oh, Lord of the whole universe."
Great.
I feel I am going to have a great day in office.
After all my day began with such a nice prayer.
You have been named aptly.
We are feeling as if we are in Hardiwar.
- Yes.
We have got such a nice daughter-in-law.
Dear, you are so cultured and you have such good values..
..in spite of living in America.
Bush taught Obama and Obama taught her.
So who is her mother is in America?
Obama?
Listen..
To celebrate Pooja arrival we will distribute that in the office.
That..
- Tennis ball?
No, not that.
- Paperweight.
'Ladoo' (Indian sweet).
Right, brother?
Yes. 'Ladoos'.
We will distribute 'Ladoo'.
We will distribute 'Ladoos'.
Yes, they are round as well.
The world is also round.
Should we distribute that?
- No, no, no.
What kind of people there are in the world, uncle.
Of different types.
They neither pray in the morning nor go to work.
Yes.
- True, dear.
There are such people as well.
What times have come!
There's a demon staying in a God's house.
I'll have to use my demonic mind.
Uncle.
- What happened?
What happened?
What happened?
- Nothing.
It's a small injury.
Should I seek revenge?
Here you go.
Mother Earth.
Bad mummy.
Bad mummy, Mother Earth.
- Sorry, uncle.
He was trying to make me fall but you fell instead.
But why was he trying to make you fall?
Anger.
I said a few true things and he got angry.
He got irritated.
Why get irritated with it?
She is telling the truth.
He is always either on his bike or his skates.
Otherwise he keeps building his body in the spare time.
Why are you ruining my healthy body?
Everyone is saying something or the other..
..don't you have to say something?
God sent him here to increase the burden on earth.
You are telling the truth for the first time.
We have been given a life..
..only so that he can disgrace us.
Absolutely right.
- He is a big disgrace.
You have a great sense of honour, uncle.
Even a Satan will look like a God in front of him.
Great.
- Wonderful.
He is..
- I think I'll have to tell aunt about your affair, uncle.
I'm not saying it from my heart.
Don't take it to your heart.
My hand broke.
- Be careful.
Be careful.
Be careful.
Take me to a hospital.
- We'll have to do something about her.
She's digging a grave for you.
What happened?
- I cannot move it.
I'll handle her.
Because uncle, once she is gone, life is fun.
Great, Pooja.
Great.
- Enough.
It is delicious.
- Fantastic.
- She cooks so well.
- Yes.
Outstanding.
Outstanding.
Yes.
- And she sings so well.
- Yes.
And she is also changing our spoilt brat for good.
- Yes.
Look, he is here.
Son, your name is Prem (love) and not 'Hatred'.
Right?
- Really?
Hey, listen.
Hello.
- Sit.
Madam, go.
Go to the airport.
Come on.
Why?
- Your father has sent a parcel for you.
From USA.
- Yes, so why are you giving me the news?
You should have collected it for me.
He is useless.
You sing so well.
You cook so well.
What would have happened if you had studied a little as well?
The officer there won't give the parcel to me without your signature.
You only will have to go there.
How will the poor girl go to airport alone?
You go with her, Prem.
Am I her driver, chauffer or servant?
Brother.
- Prem, you go with her.
Daddy, you are very that.
- I am very boring.
But still, you will go.
Go, dear.
Go.
Yes, but dad didn't inform me over the phone.
Oh, fax.
- What?
He has sent a fax, you dirty mind.
Why are you wasting time talking, Prem?
The parcel will go back.
Come on, leave.
Go.
Please go, son.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Be careful.
I think he's up to something.
I have a mobile.
I'll call if anything happens.
Only if he will let you call.
'I could've easily spent 10-12 days in this house..'
'..if he wouldn't have been born here.'
'She has made my family crazy about her in two days.'
'I would be dead if she would stay for 12 days.'
'He cannot stop taking advantage.'
'We take advantage of those we would gain something from.'
'I am just trying to get rid of her.'
'Airport is on the left and he is taking a right turn.'
'Is he planning to take me to the jungle and..'
'No, madam.
If I do any such thing..'
'..then I'll get stuck with you forever.'
'Then I will have to marry you.'
'Then why is he taking me to a jungle?
'
'Will he leave me amidst wild animals?
'
'I would have if I wasn't so concerned about the poor animals.'
'I think I'll have to show her a few lions.'
How can you even think of such a thing?
What are you doing?
Where are the keys?
- I threw it.
The steering wheel got locked.
Why did you throw it?
Are you a woman or what?
I'm a woman.
- If you are a woman..
..then you should have kept the keys here, like a woman.
Keys are not kept there.
Keys are kept around the waist.
To hell with your 26" waist.
I can see a six and a half foot grave there.
Move the steering wheel.
No, steering wheel has failed.
The steering wheel has failed.
Your mind has failed.
But the brakes didn't fail, right?
- No, they didn't.
Prem.
- She's gone.
- Prem.
Prem.
Prem.
Prem.
Where are you?
- I am here.
Down here.
She was hanging me, now God has hanged her.
Are you dead or alive?
I'm still alive, but I can die anytime.
Help me.
- Okay.
Take this.
Take my hand.
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come closer first.
No, I am thinking that it's better..
..if one person dies rather than two.
Coward.
Dastard.
Pansy.
Chicken.
Should I come there to help you so that you can help me?
Let me ask help for myself first.
Hurry up.
- Help me, God.
Give me your leg.
- You are already hanging.
How else should I hang you?
I mean give me your leg.
Leg?
Man and woman look good in pair.
But to touch something with ones' leg is a grave sin.
You are hanging on the branch with both your hands.
How will you save me?
Ma'am, each hand of mine has 2 times a gorilla's strength.
Depending on age and size.
By the way, I can save you with one hand.
Then Useless, use that hand.
Hold my waist and pull me.
No, no, no.
Not the waist.
Then you will say that I took advantage.
What?
- By the way your waist is..
Let my waist go to hell.
Hold whatever you want.
Do whatever you want.
But please save me.
In that case, come to me, my suitcase.
Look madam, you are taking advantage of my disadvantage.
- What?
If you come any closer, then I swear..
..I'll let go of both the hands and embrace you.
And both of us will be dead.
Please save me.
Let's go.
What are you doing?
Just hanging around.
Don't worry.
You women are amazing.
You cannot stick on to anything other than your age.
Sometimes you say take the advantage..
..sometimes you say don't take advantage.
What nonsense is this?
All your yakking is making me go crazy.
It was the demand of the situation.
I wasn't wrong to touch you now.
I was wrong to touch you earlier.
If this is not wrong then why is that wrong?
And if that is wrong then why isn't this wrong?
Actually, you are wrong.
It is wrong to sit here and talk to you.
It's of no use.
I'll lie down.
Obviously it's of no use.
I'm sitting and you are lying down.
It would've benefited if either, both of us were sitting or lying down.
Look, don't say double meaning things to me.
This is a limit to illiteracy.
Where is a double meaning in it?
Look, don't turn and sleep like this.
I feel something inside.
By the way, the jean fits well..
..on your waist.
My ill-fate I wish he wasn't a man.
And you weren't a woman.
Sanjana Singh.
Pooja has horns.
Prem!
'Prem.
Prem.
Prem.'
Isn't it a great place?
You call out once and it echoes back a number of times.
You have brought me here to hear this?
Oh, no.
This is nothing.
Now I'll shout your name and see what name echoes back.
Should I?
Sanjana!
'Sanjana.
Sanjana.
Sanjana.'
Hear it.
'Sanjana.
Sanjana.
Sanjana.'
I'm saying Pooja and it is echoing back as Sanjana.
Isn't it a strange place?
Look, the valley is so deep.
Prem.
- Only echoes come back from here, not people.
Tell me the truth.
Who are you?
Otherwise, I'll let go of you.
I'll tell you the truth.
Pull be back first.
Come on, start your story.
You already know my real name.
Sanjana Singh.
Actually, I had come from America to get married.
But the guy I was going to get married to..
..turned out to be a famous don's son.
I ran away from the wedding but they snatched my passport.
It takes at least 10-12 days to make a new passport.
I needed a place to hide as well.
Then I saw you at the airport.
You had come to pick up Pooja and no one knew Pooja.
So I thought..
You know the rest.
- I know the rest.
What did you do with the real Pooja?
I hope you didn't murder her.
No.
She has gone to attend her friend's wedding, in Phuket.
She will go to Guru's ashram from there.
Guru.
Guru.
Guru.
He is a..
Let's go.
Prem.
Hey, move aside.
"My heart broke."
"My heart broke."
"My heart went crazy."
I think you want me..
..to give you a lift.
You are very handsome and dashing..
..brother.
- Brother?
This car won't go anywhere.
It has broken-down.
Why?
What happened, darling?
Darling?
- The car will run.
It will get repaired.
I'm a mechanic.
It's my job.
Hope in.
Yes.
- But you didn't ask me where you should drop me.
I haven't caught you as yet, to drop you.
First let me introduce myself.
I'm Mr. Lehri.
I'm sure you know Bhappi Lehri.
There is no connection between us.
Yes, there is a connection.
He likes gold and I like to sleep.
Hello.
Why are you whistling?
You've already won over me.
Are you from Pataya?
Who is he?
Is he your boyfriend?
No, he is a distant friend.
- A distant friend?
Just like a distant relative.
Okay.
Then I have no problem..
..because I am shortsighted.
So shall we leave, Mr. Weak?
Hello.
I keep a person like you as my driver.
Really?
- Yes.
- Then give me the keys.
Come on.
The key is in its place.
I got a driver.
Come on, darling.
Come behind.
Come on.
Come on.
Watch your feet.
You aren't in the mood to come behind?
Not a problem.
We'll talk from here.
Great.
It's such a young and beautiful weather.
When I look at you I remember a romantic phrase.
Tell me.
Mingle in jungle.
I, too, remember a phrase when I see you.
A.K. Hangal in the jungle.
You know liguor and beauty have a deep connection?
I'm often intoxicated and the evening passes away.
There will be a day when the evening will be intoxicated..
..and you will pass away.
Hello.
I'm not here to get insulted.
Where do you usually go to get insulted?
Where will I go?
I stay at home.
I'm married.
You give a lift to a single girl even when you are married?
Who doesn't?
I only give, you take it as well, forcefully.
Watch out!
What is he doing up there?
Plucking fruits.
He plucked a lot of fruits.
Oh no!
- What have you done?
I didn't do it.
You did it.
Hard work paid off, didn't it?
You were driving very passionately.
Whose car is this?
- This is my car.
It's not a car.
It is my wife.
I love it.
If your wife has an affair with someone..
..then who will work hard on her?
Her lover, who else?
Who will enjoy it?
- My wife, who else?
Who will get punished?
- Me, who else?
So just imagine.
She is your wife.
Who was working hard on her?
- You.
Who was enjoying it?
- She was.
Who will get punished?
Me, who else?
Because it was my car.
Don't cry, my son.
Be strong.
The Lord works in mysterious ways, my son.
Have this fruit.
You are a Father?
Father.
Father, I had bad thoughts about her.
Father, I'm a sinner.
I've committed a grave sin, Father.
I am a sinner.
Hey!
Stop the car.
There's the girl.
What have I done!
- Prem, let's go.
They are his men.
Come.
- Come on.
Come on.
Fast.
Or she'll escape.
- I want to confess.
Where is that girl?
- Which girl?
The one who was standing here with you.
Your sister.
She..
Sister?
I think she ran away with brother-in-law.
Listen, have you seen our boss?
Who is your boss?
- Tall, board, huge man.
Okay, this..
What are you asking?
I'm selling these fruits here.
The fruits of hard work.
These fruits are very tasty.
Just taste them.
No.
I didn't.
My car hit him.
Get him.
- My car hit him.
Mr. Chaudhary, your son has gone into coma..
..because of excess blood loss.
I don't know when he will regain consciousness.
Quickly resuscitate him, Doctor..
..otherwise, I will sent you into coma.
Send me as well, sir.
To my home, sir.
Look, sir, it was my car but your son was hit by that boy.
I don't even now how to drive a car.
I swear on him.
Let him go.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
So sweet.
Yes.
Sir, I am leaving but before leaving..
..I would like to give you a small warning.
Sir, that boy is very smart.
He is fast, in driving cars and using his brain as well.
If he will come before you he will do such actions that..
..you will forget to give reactions.
Has anyone seen that boy?
Has anyone seen that boy?
I've only seen him from the left side.
And I've only seen him from the right side.
Sir, what is this left and right.
I've seen him from centre.
Will you be able to recognize him?
You are talking about recognizing?
Actually, I was born when I was small.
My mother was a woman.
And the person who murdered my father..
..underwent plastic surgery thrice.
Yet I recognized him.
Because he used to come to our shop to buy the plastic.
From now onwards, this plastic will always be with us.
Take him away.
- No.
This is wrong.
Shut up.
- This is wrong.
Find that boy and Sanjana.
Wherever they are hiding find them.
What?
- What kind of childishness is this, Pooja?
Is this a way to behave?
Does anyone hold and push anyone like this?
How was that?
- What did you do?
Like this..
Like this..
What did you do?
- What did I do?
You held her like this and pushed her like this.
The push she got had that.
The push she got had minimal effect?
- Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
Take your position.
- From there.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Come, come, one by one.
- Come on.
Come on.
Talk to your darling nephew.
- Yes.
From the time they have returned from the jungle..
..there is a lot of fun happening around.
"It is fun.
It is fun.
It is fun."
"It is fun.
It is fun.
It is fun."
Excuse me.
Just friends.
- Play the wedding tune.
Just friends.
Prem!
Prem, your method was wrong but your intentions were good.
Now I have no complaints against you.
- Mr. Pathak.
No.
No.
No.
My Khushi is so happy with Raju that I forgot all my sorrows.
Great.
Great.
Great.
- That's great.
You know I'm going to London.
Raju sent the tickets.
- Of economic class?
Yes.
- Yes.
How do you know that?
- Because I gave Raju the idea.
I told him not to buy first class tickets as you are such a miser..
..that you will be happy even with economic class ticket.
What happened?
- It got wet.
- What?
What is this, Daddy?
You always say double meaning things.
There is no double meaning in it.
The thing which we talk.
With which..
Mobile.
Mobile.
Mobile.
- Mobile?
My purse.
- My money.
My purse.
Your underwear.
Let's get out of this.
Today, I got that and after a long time that happened.
You got wet and fell in love?
No, I caught cold.
Today, the Sunday truly feels like a Sunday.
A Sunday will always be a Sunday.
- Yes.
We never go in the swimming pool together even if we want to, right?
Really.
- Thank you, Pooja.
- You're welcome.
Welcome.
Thank you.
I am Ready.
But there is a No Entry here.
Someone stop me.
Sir.
Ajunior priest has come from Guru's place.
He is here?
- Yes.
Make him comfortable..
- Yes.
The junior priest is here.
I'll go meet him and welcome him.
My wallet..
From the drawer..
That one.
Yes.
And the wallet..
Priest, why are you here?
I mean what brings you here?
I'll tell that later, but Guru is very angry with you.
Why?
- Why didn't you go to pick up Pooja from the airport?
I had gone there..
..but I got a little late.
She left to attend the wedding.
Yes, she will be going to the ashram directly from the wedding.
Be there on time to pick her up.
- As you say.
Where is everyone else?
- They are with Pooja..
But Pooja is..
- Not this one, the Pooja which was sent last month.
We sent a dog last month..
- Don't call her a dog.
The family members have named her Pooja.
They have named her Pooja?
A dog..
- Again you are calling her a dog.
Doggie, dog, puppy, pup, Raju, Tommy.
Nothing.
Call her Pooja.
Otherwise with a broom..
They are so madly in love with her that nowadays we eat dog food..
Dog..
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Pooja's food.
Pedigree and White Kennel.
So what should I call her?
Pooja?
Don't call her that if you want to lose your loincloth..
..and your honour.
Hello, Priest.
They are here to serve you.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Bless you.
Bless you.
Guru had kept a 'Satyanarayan' ritual..
- Very good.
He has sent the offering of that.
Sanjana..
As soon as they call for Pooja you come with the dog.
Tell me, where is Pooja.
She is here.
Pooja.
Now what do I tell you, Priest.
We have got very attached to Pooja in such a short span.
She is so sweet that as soon as she came, Prem..
She won everyone's heart.
'Oh God, what magic has this dog done in one month?
'
Our Pooja is as decent as she is beautiful.
'A decent dog?
'
'Have they lost their mind?
'
She is now our family member.
Does she bite?
What kind of a joke is that?
Is she a suckling that she will bite?
She is of marriageable age.
It's a different thing if she starts biting after marriage.
Whether she bites, scratches or does anything else..
..we have decided that she'll be the daughter-in-law of our family.
'They will make a dog their daughter-in-law?
'
'A dog will be perfect for you, son.'
'You deserve this.'
What are you thinking about?
That is happening with Guru's permission.
'Dandiya', 'Garba' (Gujarati dance forms).
No, no, no.
That..
That..
That..
Yes.
The alliance.
- The alliance.
The alliance.
'I think they have gone absolutely crazy.'
'They didn't go to pick up the Pooja Guru had sent..'
'..from the airport.'
'They have named their dog Pooja..'
'..and they are getting him married to her.'
'I'll also go crazy if I stay here any longer.'
I'll make a move.
Have lunch before you leave.
- Yes.
Pooja's favourite dishes have been made today.
'Oh, God.
They are feeding dog food to a priest?
'
Look, I..
You can have it.
I'm fasting today.
I'll make a move.
- Bye.
- Okay, Priest.
- Okay, Priest.
Who is this girl?
You don't recognize her?
You are strange.
She is our maid.
You had brought her here from the ashram.
'Look at that.
These lunatics think I am crazy.'
'I hope I really don't go crazy.'
Excuse me.
I'll make a move.
Okay.
- Okay.
"Baby, I can see the sun rising in your eyes."
"Baby, every time I think of you, you make me smile."
"Baby, I'll be your every dream and you should know.."
"Baby, I'll never ever want to let you go."
"Love is the dawn of the slumber of life."
"Love is a very beautiful punishment."
"I have fallen in love."
"My prayers have been answered."
"Love is the dawn of the slumber of life."
"Love is a very beautiful punishment."
"I have fallen in love."
"My prayers have been answered."
"Come, let's go somewhere."
"Let's fly and go somewhere."
"Love is our sky."
"It is as open as our desires."
"An untouched feeling touched me."
"Like there is intoxication in the sky."
"I'm in love."
"I have fallen in love."
"My prayers have been answered."
"I have fallen in love."
"My prayers have been answered."
"My path tells this to me."
"Why don't you stray a little?"
"Now this journey is unigue."
"Please ask my destination.."
"..to look out for my path from the shore."
"If you are with me.."
"..this journey is like a dream to me."
"My heart has been a bit troublesome."
"It has given me some beautiful problems."
"I have fallen in love."
"My prayers have been answered."
"Baby, I can see the sun rising in your eyes."
"Baby, every time I think of you, you make me smile."
"Baby, I'll never ever want to let you go."
"Never even in my dreams had I ever thought.."
"..that the God of desires would give me so much."
"I kept walking in a carefree manner."
"I kept walking on my path."
"I didn't know that my heart will stop for you."
"I'm in love."
"I have fallen in love."
"My prayers have been answered."

"My prayers have been answered."
"Baby."
Maids.
- Yes, brother.
Where is everybody gone?
Brother..
Gone ashram.
Meeting Guru.
And Pooja?
- Gone.. with them too.
Why, brother?
Heart beating fasting?
Brother, where are you running?
Come on, come on.
- Come.
This is Guru's that.
What is it called..
As..
Ashram.
We've come here to fix a wedding date for your marriage with Prem.
Yes.
Let's go.
You go ahead.
We'll come.
- Okay.
Pooja, it is believed that all wishes..
Come.
Which Pooja are you talking about, Ram?
Pooja has not returned from her friend's wedding.
Then who is the one who has been staying..
..in our house as Pooja since the past few days.
Who is the scoundrel you ran away with?
Kill his entire family.
How is that possible!
You want me, right?
I'm ready to come with you.
Let's go.
Come on.
Leave me.
Brother-in-law.
Sanjana is not here.
I knew that you would surely come.
And I, too, knew that you would say..
.."I knew that you would surely come."
Why should I come, huh?
Am I your boyfriend?
I love you?
- Saw?
You are agreeing to it.
No.
Really?
He's your uncle?
Yes.
Prem, how would I tell you that..
..these goons, mafias are my maternal uncles?
Great.
Your family members are like Charles Shobraj and Ranja Billa?
I love these mafia people.
Stop joking, Prem.
You don't know how much my uncles hate each other
My mother's last wish was..
..that I get both my uncles' blessings at my wedding.
So that their enmity ends forever..
..and they become good human beings like they were, earlier.
But?
- The greed of attaining my property worth 200 crores..
..increased their enmity.
Each one of them wants me to marry his brother-in-law.
200 crores?
I can draw a chegue without deducting the TDS..
..and keep your uncles in my pocket.
But my dear, until there are obstacles in a love story..
..it is not called a love story.
What stories will we tell our children?
Look, a boyfriend gets scared of his girlfriend.
A girlfriend gets scared of a cockroach.
A cockroach gets scared of a mouse.
A mouse gets scared of a cat.
A cat gets scared of a dog.
And a dog gets scared of a man.
- And a man is scared of a woman.
- What?
Just like a villain..
gets scared of the hero.
Prem, let's go.
My uncle is here.
What now?
They will..
- Don't worry, dear.
Today, I'll predict your future.
You will get married to an innocent looking rogue.
That's me.
Now can I take some advantage?
By the way, the fitting of the Indian dress is very good.
"Ready..
I am ready for you.
Are you ready for me?"
"Are you ready for me?
Are you ready for me?"
"Are you ready for me?
I am ready for you."
Uncle, Yuvraj was forcefully..
I ran away from there.
Sit in the car.
They are drying out.
This boy is making me that.
That..
Irritate?
- No, not irritate.
That..
This..
This..
Emotional?
- Emotional is like this.
This..
- So?
He is making me this.
This.
This..
Crazy.
- Crazy.
- Crazy.
He is making crazy.
Crazy.
Crazy.
He lied to me.
That girl is not this but that.
What..
- Not Sanjana, Pooja.
Pooja.
Yes.
Yes.
What you are thinking of doing is not so easy.
They are dangerous.
- Yes.
They are dons.
I would've said the same had I been in your place.
But.. what would've you done had you been in my place?
Why don't you make him understand?
What should I tell him?
All I know is that Sanjana is a very nice girl.
And right now, she must be in trouble.
She must be in big trouble.
That's true, sister-in-law.
But there is no solution to this problem.
I have such a solution that I'll make the lives of both the dons, hell.
They have a common CA, who has done BA.
And his name..
What was his name?
Sounds like bully.
- Idli (a south Indian snack)?
Mulli (Raddish)?
Pulley.
- Talli (drunk)?
No, close.
Close.
Khuli (open)?
Khali?
Khali.
Balli.
Balidaan Bhardwaj.
Sakku, how many times will you call me?
I feel that you call me even when you dial a wrong number.
What do I do?
You have left the house with so much cash.
I'm feeling scared.
This isn't the first time I'm out with so much cash.
I do transactions worth millions, day and night.
All 500 and 1000 denomination bills..
..across the world knows Balidaan Bhardwaj.
Then?
- That's fine.
But what if a thief stabs you and robs you?
Sakku, are you concerned about me..
..or are you trying to kill me?
Hang up, Sakku.
I want two demands drafts made.
One of30 lakhs and the other of20 lakhs.
Take this.
My bag?
My bag!
Where did my bag go?
Where is my bag?
There was 50 lakhs in the bag.
Where did the bag go?
My bag.
My bag got stolen.
Have you seen a thief here?
- No.
You blind man, you didn't see the thief?
.
You didn't even see such a big bag?
I didn't see it.
I'm not the owner of it.
You..
Have you seen your face?
It's so black that if shown on National Television..
..it will ward off evil from the entire country.
Sakku, what you said came true.
Sakku.
What happened?
Amar Chaudhary and Suraj Chaudhary's 50 lakhs got stolen.
What?
Don't do this.
Pack the bags.
It's time to leave the city.
Come on.
- Yes.
They are here.
Tell them I am not here.
I'll go and hide myself.
Mr. Bhardwaj.
Mr. Bhardwaj.
He has not only left this house but this world as well.
A trunk ran over him.
- Oh, no.
He got crushed.
Do you have anyone to look after you in this cruel world?
No.
By the way, I had brought this bag for him.
What will I do of this briefcase when he is no more?
Don't worry.
I'll take care of both his belongings.
Okay?
Let's meet after his final rites.
Bring it here.
Where are you going?
You are alive, sir?
- Yes, I'm alive.
It's her hobby.
She kills her husband over everything.
Start wearing a wedding chain from tomorrow.
People get mistaken.
She is mine.
And.. this bag is also mine.
There are only 50 lakhs in it, right, sir?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
There are only 50 lakhs..
Just a minute.
How did you come to know that there are 50 lakhs in it?
Just be looking at the bundle of the notes..
..I can predict how many notes it contains.
How?
- I learnt this art from my master.
Mr. B. B., sir.
Bishan Singh Bedi?
- No, sir.
Then?
Balibhrambhat.
- No, no, sir.
Bichun Bhutia.
Goal.
No way, sir.
The one who has written this book.
Mr. Balidaan Bhardwaj.
Be careful, sir.
I've written a book?
When did I write this book?
Such a fat book?
You?
- Yes.
Look at this.
The Balidaan in front of Bhardwaj is me.
That's me.
This is a sign of a genius.
You wrote a book and you don't even remember.
Sir, this book is a missile and you are an example..
..for a newcomer like me.
I have come to this city to be your assistant, sir.
I see.
- I want to learn the ropes of this job with you.
I don't want any money either.
- Then my job is done.
I mean your job is done.
- Thank you, sir.
I have only two clients.
Amar Chaudhary and Suraj Chaudhary.
Sir, they are mafias.
One is a mongoose.
And the other one is a snake.
If they get together then they are killer sharks.
But both of them are illiterates.
How many times during a year do you think..
..people like Chaudhary must be paying their taxes?
Sir, they must not even be paying the taxi fare.
Sir..
I make them pay tax every month.
Every month?
Again and again.
- Again and again.
12 times.
- 12 times.
Yes.
What do I do?
It is dirty but it is my business.
It is your business.
This is the only way to teach a lesson to those goons.
Sir, your name is Balidaan but you are making your clients sacrifice.
Now that you have joined me..
..everyone will be sacrificed..
with Prem (love).
Come with us.
Come with us.
- Why are you hitting me?
Come with us.
Come with us.
- Why are you hitting me?
Hit him.
Stop.
Stop.
Don't hit me.
Stop.
Stop.
I am your teacher, Amar Chaudhary.
Teacher?
You are a cheater, you scoundrel.
You give me a zero in the exams.
You gave the wrong answer.
What was the guestion?
Who is the president of India?
- Mrs. Prathiba Patil.
You had said that it was Abdul Kallam.
The president got changed.
It is my fault that the president got changed?
What do I have to do with when and where Alexander fought Porus?
Do I have to go there and dig their graves?
Hit him.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Well done.
You are doing well, Amar Chaudhary.
Saw that?
That's why I named him after me.
Amar Chaudhary.
Hey, Amar Chaudhary!
You stinky insect of a dirty sewer?
Mother, you go inside.
- Stop barking, you dog.
And let him go.
Otherwise I'll poison your food and feed you.
Got it?
Hey, go.
Take him back with dignity.
Go.
Yes.
- Go.
Let's go, sir.
Grandpa, you are being abused under his pretext.
No, no.
It's not so.
You are like a father to my daughter-in-law.
You are God.
A born leech.
- What?
He is.
This Amar Chaudhary.
It's time for school.
Don't you have to go?
Father, should I get something for you?
Yes, daughter-in-law.
Get some tea for me.
Okay.
- Without sugar.
And without poison.
Have some sweets, Mr. Chaudhary.
I got the land for your liguor factory cleared.
And it hardly cost you anything.
Only 50 lakhs.
Balli.
- Yes.
Don't you know you cannot bring strangers in here?
Who is he?
- He's my nephew.
Nephew?
- Yes, look.
We look similar, don't we?
You mean when I am of your age I will look like you?
Forget about the face, Mr. Chaudhary.
Talk about brains.
He is from America.
He will show your income so less..
..that you won't need to pay tax.
- Really?
You know the billionaire in America?
K.K. Modi.
He used to handle his account.
K. K. Modi?
- K. K. Modi?
Forget it.
Forget K. K. Modi.
Now that you are here you work for Mr. Chaudhary.
Handle his account.
Hire you nephew.
- Nephew!
Grandpa, it sounds like your business.
Ganja.
Balli.
- Yes?
You didn't teach your nephew how to salute?
Salute me.
What to get thrashed?
What did you say?
- No.
I saw my horoscope in the morning.
Yes.
- In it it's written that if I salute..
..anyone younger than me today..
..then he will get thrashed all day long.
But still if you want..
- No, no.
Let it be.
But I have read his horoscope.
Balli.
Come on.
- Let it be, today.
My nephew is with me.
So..
Balli.
Yes.
Now my hands feel warmer.
The apple of my eye.
My brave boy.
- Wild hippo, Amar Chaudhary.
Write 'Welcome' on your face.
You will look like a rotten doormat.
Anyway, your ponytail looks like a dead dog's tail.
Look at your grandpa.
It suits him so well.
Take this.
Stupid.
Go to school.
Yes, grandpa.
This is the first time mother has said the right thing.
The girls in my class tease me.
They said it looks like theirs.
With your permission can I chop it off?
.
Amar Chaudhary, you can have your neck cut but not your ponytail.
This is a warning, not advice.
We are samurais.
This is the identity of our family.
Your I.D. proof.
It is a voter's card, pan card.
Your blood group.
A proof that you are his grandson and he is your grandpa.
Where did this boring old man come from?
Great grandpa.
I saw you.
Today my day will go well.
Concentrate on your studies.
Kids of your age have gone places.
People of your age as well..
..have gone places.
"Happy days are over."
"Now I'm surrounded with sadness."
What is this, Mr. Lehri?
What are you doing?
I'm having black coffee with Obama in the White House.
Can't you see?
I hit the brakes to give you a lift.
Now my shirt has turned into a mop.
All this happened because of me, right?
I'm feeling very guilty.
I love you too.
Now it is my duty to get you out of here.
I also want to leave.
Because if my children grow up they won't recognize me.
And my wife is so nave that the poor thing..
..might once again run away with someone.
No such thing will happen because I have a mind-blowing idea.
This is the boy with whom Sanjana ran away, sir.
He doesn't look like he is from our city.
I'll find him even if he is hiding underground.
Are you telling the truth?
Sir, if I am lying he should die immediately.
No, I take his oath and say that henceforth..
..that that boy was not him but someone else.
Sir.
- What happened?
Sir, someone has come to meet you.
Balli, you got the land cleared for Amar for his liguor factory?
I just got the land cleared for him.
But for you along with the land I also got..
..the license for the liguor factory cleared.
Lehri, go.
You are free to go.
Mr. Chaudhary, I am leaving but before leaving..
..I would like to give you a warning.
Sir, this boy is very smart.
Only I know how he traps people.
You won't be able to anything to him..
..even if he comes and stands before you.
You do one thing.
You keep cleaning cars here till Sanjana's marriage.
Sir, what are you saying?
Sir, this is a crime.
It's a sin.
Mr. Chaudhary, you cannot do this.
Mr. Chaudhary can do anything.
He is Justice Chaudhary.
He provides justice to good people.
And he clears out the bad people.
Pick him and throw him out.
Balli, who is this boy?
He is a con.
C-O-N.
Con.
He joined hands with that girl and fooled me.
Which animal have I left out?
- You dog, clean the car.
Mr. Chaudhary, isn't the boy useful?
Once I start working, there will be no income and no tax.
No income tax.
But Balli, how is this possible?
This boy will work for Amar as well as us.
He has a habit..
..of doing two things together.
You know K.K. Modi in America?
He used to also handle his younger brother S.K. Modi's account.
But what if he turns out to be bad?
Then you can behead my uncle.
Behead me?
- Saw?
He agrees to it.
The thumb impression on the file.
Take it.
Just a minute.
Uncle, I was casually checking your accounts.
There are a lot of discrepancies.
What?
- There must be a slight difference.
21.
- 21..
Balli.
There is a difference of Rs.21.
Rs.21, dear?
It's hardly a difference.
Just a minute, uncle.
You are his assistant, right?
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on, show me the accounts.
Uncle, I'll go and check the accounts properly.
Yes, yes.
Okay, dear.
Hey..
Persuade her.
- Consider it done.
Balli, you saw how my niece's education is benefiting me?
Prem, this is not the right situation to take advantage.
Really?
Then promise me that you will meet me tonight.
And you will let me take all the advantages.
- Prem.
You..
You okay?
- Yes.
I was justjoking.
Balli, why do you look as if you've seen a ghost?
Our future daughter-in-law is checking everything, right?
Yes.
In detail.
Come with me.
Come with me.
Let them work.
Saw that?
My future wife is no ordinary girl.
Yes, I just came to know.
She has taken after me deceased sister.
So, your sister was also like her?
Then the entire family..
What happened?
He is getting scared.
- He fears he might get caught.
Sanjana..
Sanjana is not my daughter.
She is more than a daughter to me, Prem.
Her happiness means everything to me.
But..
But you don't know her uncles.
They..
- I know.
They are rogues from the Neanderthal times.
Orthodox.
I am a modern age dog.
Latest.
When we will fight, I will eat them up.
"I am a dog and she is my partner."
"I tell the truth, when she came.."
"..there came a season to eat everyone up."
Stop it.
Look, aunt, everything will be fine.
I promise.
What were you doing inside?
All that cuddling and all?
Uncle, she fell over me.
Girls from affluent families..
Hello.
Girls from affluent families are like that.
Try to understand.
Whether she falls on you or you fall on her..
..our necks will get cut and fall down.
Uncle, you only asked me to persuade her.
I got persuaded.
You would've got exposed..
..if she would've opened the accounts.
This is the first time I have let a girl touch me and you..
No, no.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
You are my disciple.
Come on, get in.
Get in.
Let's go.
Let's go.
"In 12 months I'll express my love to you in 12 different ways."
"Now I think I won't be able to survive.."
"..even for 12 minutes without you."
"When the winter season starts in January."
"We will switch on the heater of love."
"In a blanket as small as February.."
"..we will play hide and seek."
"March will be a romantic month."
"We'll do something we have never done before."
"What if we aren't able to meet in April?"
"What will happen?
Find a solution."
"I'll get an internet connection so that I can chat with you."
"When the summer season starts in May.."
"..we will party at the poolside."
"We will take a long vacation in June."
"We will go to a hill station."
"When starts raining in July.."
"..
I'll yearn to embrace you."
"We will have a lot of fun in August."
"We will make some arrangements."
"I'll take you to London.
I'll give you a tour of Paris."
"I'll take you on a world tour."
"I feel that I'll be coming often to your house in September."
"We'll see the sunsets together in October."
"You can keep your head on my shoulders."
"By the time the wretch November comes.."
"..you would've already surrendered your heart."
"Things will get confirmed on 12th December."
"With the confirmation from our hearts."
"There will be no car or mare."
"I'll bring the wedding procession on foot."
"In 12 months I'll express my love to you in 12 different ways."
"Now I think I won't be able to survive.."
"..even for 12 minutes without you."
Prem hasn't come as yet, dear.
Don't worry, aunt.
He will surely come.
Why don't you go and pay your respects..
..as you have come to the temple, Junior Chaudhary?
Tell me.
I prayed for a week before my exams.
He failed me.
- Then why have you come here?
I'm my grandpa's junior spy.
Whenever any female in the family goes out of the house..
..I keep an eye on them.
Whether they are going and meeting our enemies.
Aunt.
Go.
My child.
Bless you.
- That's enough.
Bless you.
Sister.
Someone stop them.
You are crying?
They are bound to cry.
These sisters-in-law love each other more than their own sister.
In spite of living in the same city we have met after ages.
Our men our fighting and we women are suffering.
I wonder when this will end.
Like I have united the aunts I will unite the uncles as well.
If I don't turn this family into a 'Hum Aapke Hain Kyon' family..
..then don't call me Prem.
Thank you.
Okay, so you are befriending our enemies..
..in the pretext of praying and worshiping?
Son, she isn't an enemy.
She is your grandaunt.
Amar, my child.
- Don't touch me, you old woman.
Scoundrel, if you say a word more..
..I'll feed you kerosene and light a match in front of your mouth.
Get out of here.
Forgive him, sister.
His grandfather has made him just like him.
I wonder when he will mend his ways.
Why are you laughing?
He will change, but I'm laughing..
..thinking of the way in which he will change.
Junior Chaudhary, the park is closed.
It's closed for others, not me.
Go and tell the manager, Amar Chaudhary is here.
The park will remain open.
Okay, sir.
- Okay, sir.
Come here, you animal.
Salute me.
The park should be closed now.
We have to go home.
You are refusing Amar Chaudhary?
Come here.
How dare you!
I won't spare you.
Go.
Who..
Who are you?
Badman.
Badman?
- Yes.
I'm here to turn a bad boy like you into a good boy.
You..
One kick and from Badman you will become a dead man.
Kick me.
Kick me.
Kick me.
Really?
Here you go.
Darn him.
I am sorry, bad-man.
Spare me.
Forgive me.
Okay.
From today, you'll be a good boy.
Yes, I will.
You won't bunk school.
- Okay.
You won't trouble your teachers.
You'll always respect your elders.
And you will cut your ponytail as well.
- Yes.
No, no.
This is not possible.
It is the identity of my family.
Shut up.
The kid has tired me.
First try to talk things out.
If they don't understand then kick them.
Great, Balli.
Great.
Your nephew is one in a million.
Amar Chaudhary.
Why do you have bandana on your head?
It's the latest fashion, grandpa.
Okay.
Okay.
Fashion.
Come here, my tiger.
And hit on this jackal's head.
Bless me, uncle Balli.
What are you doing?
Respecting my elders, grandfather.
This is what Badman has taught us.
Who Badman?
- He is our new teacher, grandpa.
Teacher?
Grandpa, his new teacher is Prem.
Dear, now I feel he'll also bring my two scoundrels back on track.
Hello
Uncle, uncle Suraj is once again trying to get me married to Veer.
What?
- Yes.
But I want to marry your son, Yuvraj.
Yuvraj?
- Please, uncle.
Please, do something.
Please, guickly get me out of here.
Someone is coming.
Come on, get the cars out.
Load your guns.
Let there be bloodshed?
We will have to bring Sanjana at any cost by this evening.
What are you doing, Chaudhary..
Sir.
Uncle, tell them.
What you are doing is wrong.
You are going to kill your brother for 200 crores?
Whereas someone worth 500 crores is in uncle's pocket.
Who are you talking about?
Uncle, I'm talking about K.K Modi.
Yes.
K.K. Modi from America.
Tell them how much he is worth.
He is worth 5000-7000 crores.
And hear this.
You know who has been given..
..the responsibility of getting his daughter Naina married?
Uncle.
Uncle, you couldn't see this gem of a person?
Whereas Naina desires a gem of a person.
They are such lovely people.
They are romantic.
They are going to kill their brothers.
Uncle, if I wouldn't have thought of this..
..then there would've been a bloodshed today.
Why don't you think?
No, the idea was on the way in my mind..
..but because of traffic..
Get this straight, Balli.
If we don't get this alliance then consider yourself death.
Get out of here.
I took K.K. Modi's name just like that.
You added his daughter to the story.
You added the responsibility of her marriage.
You added all the spices.
Sir, you told me all this..
after having a few drinks.
I told you about people who don't exist?
They exist, sir.
Listen.
- Yes?
Some K.K. Modi has called five times since morning.
He told me to remind you that he is coming..
..to India on Friday to discuss his daughter's wedding.
And yes, he has asked to book some resort.
Don't forget.
How is this possible?
Sir, this means you either have MP or UP.
Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh?
MP means memory power.
- Okay.
Sir, in this illness the battery of memory conks off.
Or UP that is unbelievable power.
Unbelievable power.
- Yes, sir.
In this the characters you think about come in real life.
I don't believe this.
That's why it is called unbelievable power.
Now you have to decide whether..
..it's your effective thinking or defective disease.
Meanwhile, sir, you have thrown me out of the house.
Bye.
Taxi!
- No, Prem.
I said that as I was worried.
Please.
Okay.
- Don't leave me in such confusion.
Okay, sir.
Tell me what I should do next.
There is no option or resort to this.
Yes, the last resort is that you book a resort.
Okay.
They have come?
Limo.
Ballu.
Ballu.
Uncle, go and welcome Modi.
What a pleasant surprise.
Come here.
Come here.
Give your friend a hug.
You have become fit.
I think it is the result of sister-in-law Shakuntala's that.
Love.
- Her love.
How is sister-in-law Sakku?
I hope you didn't have any that on the way.
What is it..
No, no.
One has to take some that for one's child.
Some..
Trouble.
- Yes, trouble.
Let's go.
Mr. Modi.
- Mr. Modi.
Stop.
Is this a way to ask for donations?
Mr. Modi, he is Mr. Chaudhary.
Avery famous L in the city.
- Landlord?
- Landlord.
- Landlord.
Mr. Modi, welcome, welcome, welcome.
Welcome.
Uncle Modi.
Aunt Modi.
Balli works for us.
Okay, Balli knows you.
That means he is our that..
Guest.
- Guest.
Guest.
Call him tonight for..
- Drinks?
Dinner.
Dinner.
And that as well.
Let's go.
Why are you staring at them with your mouth open?
Have you seen them for the first time?
Anyone will give that reaction on seeing Mr. Modi.
Sir, if you are a mouse then he is a cat.
If you are a cat, he is a dog.
If you are a dog, he is a fox.
If you are a fox then he is a lion.
If you are lion then he is an elephant.
If you are an elephant then he is a dinosaur.
Dinosaur of business, sir.
For your own good, come on time for dinner.
Otherwise you are a donkey, sir.
Who is going anywhere?
I am here till night.
Yes.
- Yes.
Let's go.
What happened, uncle?
He met me with so much affection.
He gave me a hug as well.
But I couldn't recognize him.
Is it an illness or my imagination?
Both.
- Both?
One personality is ill.
It is the imagination of the other personality.
The first and the second personality clashed..
..with each other and resulted in the third personality.
Spilt personality.
The fourth personality will be suicidal personality.
You will feel like committing suicide, uncle.
You are right.
- No.
I feel like committing suicide.
- No.
Yes.
- Don't do it, uncle.
- Why?
You won't remember that you have committed suicide, uncle.
So what should I do?
Uncle, now you have only one option left.
What?
- Believe that your personality with imagination is right.
You know him.
He is K.K. Modi.
- You recognize him.
I'll have to.
Otherwise, I'll commit suicide..
..and I won't even remember it.
So what's the use?
He is K.K. Modi.
Mr. Modi, we are not as rich as you are.
But we are well respected in the city.
Great.
- Yes, sir.
They are decent people.
Really?
- They have a lot of cars and are cultured as well.
So brother, tell us, how much loan do you want?
No, sister-in-law, I am..
Balli, tell them.
- What should I say?
Uncle, with your permission can I tell them?
- Yes, please.
Mr. Modi, he is his brother-in-law.
Yuvraj.
He has studied till the 8th grade.
The 8th grade.
Raise two more fingers.
Yes, the 8th grade.
He has studied till the 8th grade.
So?
He wants to marry your daughter.
- What?
Brother Ballu, you have brought such an alliance?
Have you seen their faces?
They look as if they have just come out of a jungle.
Right.
Will their daughter marry into this illiterate family?
The Modis.
They don't have any sense of that.
Fashion.
Nor do they know how to that.
- Talk.
To talk.
They look like that.
That..
Ape-men.
- Ape-men.
If you weren't my friend I would have done that.
Shot.
- Shot you.
Let's go..
- Sumitra.
- Sumitra.
Let's go.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- Okay.
You ruined their mood.
- Shut up.
Shut up.
You..
I'll blow your head with you, you scoundrel.
You fool, he isn't a scoundrel, you are.
Do you know who are you messing with?
You can only make scrabbled-eggs from an egg.
Mr. Modi can turn scrabbled-eggs back to an egg.
You have spoilt the whole game.
But it's okay.
Uncle is here.
He will think of something.
What will I think of?
.
I am totally confused.
Will you tell us what this is all about?
Why have you made us all wear sunglasses?
Excuse me for my language, grandpa.
But what do these Modis think of themselves?
They have kept three conditions for the wedding.
I told them that I won't be able to look into your eyes..
..after telling you those conditions.
And you won't be able to look at each other after hearing them.
He said, "Here, make them wear these sunglasses.."
"..and tell them the conditions."
Tell us.
Tell us, what their conditions are.
Basically the Modis have made..
..the tent of Chaudhary's lives stand on three sticks.
Condition No. 1.
They don't like the way you dress.
What are you doing?
They say that you look like a C-Grade movie's villain.
How dare they!
This..
This is what uncle said.
How dare they!
- Yes.
Yes.
The Chaudharys will never change..
..their dressing sense for their 500 crores.
- Yes.
500..
- Crores.
Okay.
Okay.
We will wear up-to-date suits.
Yes.
- Yes.
Yes.
What is their second condition?
Their family is a joint family like in the movie 'Hum Aapke Hain Kyon'.
They all live together.
So is our family like in the movie 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham'?
We stay separately?
They have never seen you out on a lunch or a picnic..
..with your daughters and daughters-in-law.
- Enough.
They are womenfolk.
This tradition has been going on since ages.
This is what uncle said as well.
- What?
That the Chaudharys will never change their tradition for 500 crores.
Yes.
- 500 crores.
Fine.
Fine.
Listen.
Listen.
Henceforth, we'll all be together.
Tell me the third condition.
If I tell you the third condition then.. your pants will tear.
Pants?
- I am saying this.
I am saying this.
He had said something else.
Tell me the condition.
You'll have to cut it.
- What?
You'll have to cut your ponytail.
- No.
Even uncle yelled and said no.
- Yes.
Yes.
But what can we do?
They hold the trump card of 500 crores.
500 crores. 500 crores.
Cut them, Amar.
You can always grow them back.
But you don't often get a harvest worth 500 crores.
Great.
Now you are looking that and that.
Bold and beautiful.
- Bold and the beautiful.
So tell us, brother.
What have you decided?
What have I..
What do you say, Ballu?
Should I do that?
Yes?
- Do it.
Now that you have found a diamond..
..better set it in the ring.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Fine, then I'll call my daughter and younger that tomorrow.
Brother.
- Brother.
Okay.
- Do you have relatives or brothers or something like that?
No.
He has an elder brother..
Name?
- Suraj Chaudhary.
In spite of having an elder brother..
..you have come alone to fix the alliance?
Where is he?
How can he come here?
We don't get along.
A house where brothers don't that..
- Get along.
Get long.
Will their daughter go there?
- The Modis.
The Modis.
What he means is that their timings don't match.
He is sometimes out and he is sometimes in.
These two brothers love each other a lot.
Like..
Lord Rama and Laxman.
- Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So call them tonight.
Match the..
Timings.
- Timing.
Yes.
Consider it to be our that..
- Condition.
- Yes.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Don't hit my uncle.
What was the need to say..
- Sister-in-law, please, help.
That I have an elder brother?
I said it because you have one.
You could have said that he is dead.
You are strange.
How could say that?
Till date you haven't been able to kill him.
So uncle, how will you kill him?
But we are dead now.
That old man will never listen to us.
Hey, when God gave uncle a head over his shoulders..
..he didn't give it for decoration.
He will think.
He will think of something.
He will bring your brother by his ears.
Shut up.
Suraj Chaudhary will behead me even if I talk about it.
And if he doesn't come here then I'll behead you.
What?
Hey, let us go in.
Move aside.
Side.
Side.
Side.
- Who are you?
Keep distance.
Horn please.
May the face of the one with ill-intentions in his heart go black!
Seize the whole place.
Take everyone's mobiles.
Disconnect their phone.
Hey, who are you?
In this manner..
This is how we enter.
You have all the right to remain silent..
..as this is a raid.
I pay income tax thirteen times a year.
Yet there is a raid?
Sir, Ms. Sanjana.
Hello, uncle Mathur.
Hello, dear.
How are you?
Sanjana, you know these income-tax guys?
Aunt, they are not from the income-tax department.
They are from the World Bank.
I have heard of Punjab Bank and Allahabad Bank.
What is a World Bank?
The one outside Punjab and Allahabad is called World Bank.
The father of all banks.
And the mother of all banks.
Uncle and aunt of all banks.
But, sir, what are you doing here?
Ms. Sanjana's father had taken a loan of200 crores from our bank.
So?
- So he passed away before he could settle the loan.
So?
- He keeps on saying 'so'.
He will lose his mind when he will hear this.
So, we have seized all his property in America.
We have managed to get back 100 crores.
We still need to recover 100 crores.
But Sanjana doesn't hold any property here.
She came here to get married to me.
Fantastic.
After marriage a wife has egual right over the property.
Hence, according to law, we will recover 100 crores from you.
The bungalow itself must be worth 50-60 crores.
Come, let's go.
Let's go.
Mr. Lover, I knew that you would get this marriage canceled.
But what is this issue of100 crores?
Should I tell you everything today itself?
.
What's the rush?
Where are you going?
You are here.
Polish them.
Balli, what kind of a law is this?
The law is according to the place.
Uncle, including this house and other things..
..you will manage to arrange 100 crores, right?
You, too, wouldn't want my deceased father..
..to owe a loan to anyone, right?
Listen, assistant.
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on, let's check the value of the property.
Okay.
- Again?
No.
Actually I have some work with him.
Not now.
Okay?
Fine.
We will begin once your work is done.
Okay, ma'am.
How much work will you do?
You will get tired.
You..
- Everyone is standing here.
It's written in the scriptures, uncle..
..the more you work the better it is.
This girl will put me on streets to beg.
Now I got it.
Why did he break the alliance with this girl..
..and formed an alliance with K.K. Modi.
He knows that this girl has a loan over her head.
Balli.
- Yes.
Instead of us, you got K.K. Modi's daughter..
..alliance fixed into Amar's family.
If he has ruined it, he will mend it.
How?
- How?
You know B.K. Modi.
- Who is B.K. Modi?
You only had said that K.K. Modi has a younger brother.
Yes.
Yes.
He does.
He does.
K.K. Modi has a younger brother.
But what about him?
- His money.
What about his money?
You only had said..
- What?
That he is richer..
..than his elder brother when it comes to money.
Yes.
Yes.
I said so.
But what about him?
- His daughter.
Daughter.
- Daughter.
His daughter's..
mother will also be there.
What about his daughter?
You had taken the responsibility of getting her married.
Wow, Balli.
No matter what you say that's a great condition.
Not condition, connection.
- Whatever.
But tell him Mr. Modi's conditions.
Yes, ma'am.
Coming.
I'll go and check the property.
I'll see how much worth it is.
Darling Balli, what conditions do these Modis have?
"Forgot tradition and became ready."
"If they get it right they will make it big."
"Money can make you do anything."
Amar!
- Brother!
Brother!
Where is your party?
Has gone to pickup your party at the airport.
Where did she come from?
Did you call her?
It feels very nice to see the two of you together today, uncle.
Now my problem is also over.
Now both of you decide who I should marry.
Dear, you should forget Veer.
Last night your mother visited me in my dreams.
And she said, "Veer isn't good enough for my Sanjana."
So the confusion is over.
I will get married to Yuvraj.
No, no, no, no, no, dear.
Yuvraj is absolutely useless.
Your mother visited me in my dreams as well.
She started crying.
She said, "Brother, don't ruin my Sanjana's life.
More tears.
What about me?
Will I stay single all my life?
- Not at all, dear.
We, your uncles are there for you.
We will find someone good enough for you.
Nice, capable and decent.
We will have a grand wedding for you.
Why do you worry, dear?
We are there for you.
- Yes.
Okay, uncle.
Whatever you feel is right.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Meet him.
He's my younger brother..
- B.K..
B.K. Modi.
- Yes.
- Modi.
Look who it is.
Ballu.
How are you, Ballu?
Hi, B.K. How are you?
You look fit.
I think sister-in-law's love has played its trick.
How is sister-in-law, Sakku?
She's absolutely fine.
She keeps talking about all of you.
How is B.K?
What is he doing these days?
That's fine.
Mr. Modi, the girls didn't come with you?
To hell with the girls.
- What?
- What?
He means say hello to Naina and Sunaina.
Yes, they are the apple of their mothers' eyes.
Naina.
- Sunaina.
They both are great, aren't they?
Walk straight.
What are you thinking about, uncle?
What are you thinking about?
I couldn't recognize the other Modi as well.
Uncle, this means it's not an illness but an imagination.
You mean the character I think about, comes to life?
Yes.
You have the power.
Otherwise, how is it possible, uncle.
What will we call a person with such imagination?
We cannot call him human.
You mean I am..
God?
Brahma.
The Creator.
The creator of the universe.
Balli.
Balli.
Look..
How they address God.
Idiots.
He has regained consciousness.
Now we will have fun.
Start that.
Mr. Chaudhary, he is out of coma, but he is unable to speak.
How can he not speak?
Son..
Tell me, who was he?
Speak up.
Tell me.
Who was he?
Tell me, son.
Try to speak.
Try.
Uncle, why is he pointing towards you?
Balli.
This means you..
No, sir.
I cannot even put a comma to sentence.
How can I put him into coma?
Mr. Chaudhary, your son is still not out of coma.
His mind is spinning hence he is moving his finger here and there.
Look, now he is pointing towards him.
Mr. Chaudhary, your son's condition is so bad..
..that he might even point his finger towards you.
Oh, my.
The son is pointing towards his father.
Please go out.
The patient is getting hyper.
Doctor, make my son get well soon.
Because the day he will come out of coma..
..someone else will go into coma.
Let's go.
Let's go.
There are so many sorrows in this world.
Your sorrow is so less.
You aren't able to say anything..
..because of your unconscious state.
And he cannot say anything even when he is conscious.
So sad is this and how bad is that.
Continue.
Sir.
No, sir.
Madam..
- Move back.
I don't care.
Please sir.
Sir, please.
- It's not my problem..
..as to with whom Mr. Chaudhary..
..is having his breakfast and his lunch.
Mr. Chaudhary, I've been looking for you all over the city.
And you are having fun over here.
You are having parties.
I'm being pressurized by the bank.
I keep getting phone calls.
Tell me what you want to do.
Mr. Modi, you are here?
What a pleasant surprise.
Hello, sister-in-law.
- Hello, brother.
Sister-in-law, it seems like you have come here on a holiday.
No, brother.
Our daughters are getting that with the brothers-in-law.
They are getting married with the brothers-in-law.
Mr. Suraj.
- Yes.
Your brother-in-law Veer was going to marry your niece, right?
No.
Niece?
Who is his niece?
Here she is.
Sanjana.
She is a very nice girl.
Why do you want to get related to us instead of her?
Actually, what happened was..
- For Sanjana's happiness.
Sanjana doesn't like Veer and that's why..
..Mr. Chaudhary cancelled the wedding.
Great people.
This is very that.
- Good.
- Good.
Avery good thing.
But brother, it's wrong as well.
Look brother, there is a young unmarried girl in their family.
And they are getting their brothers-in-law married.
It is wrong, isn't it?
True.
It is not so.
Mr. Chaudhary is looking for a suitable boy for her.
He will get her married as soon as he finds a suitable boy.
Take your time and find a boy.
We are here for four days.
Look, first Sanjana will get married then our daughters will.
But Mr. Modi..
- No ifs or buts.
Consider this to be our that.
- Condition.
- Our condition.
Yes.
- Another condition?
Don't worry.
All the four Chaudharys are charged.
They will do something in four days.
Great people.
People, everybody join me please.
"Whether you are a crescent or the moonlight."
"No matter what you are.."
"..
I swear on God, you are great."
Clap, everyone.
Great.
Great.
Brother, the Chaudharys might get a heart attack..
..listening to your conditions.
Brother has kept a condition ofSanjana's wedding.
- Yes.
But you'll have to give the idea that our Prem will be her groom.
Yes.
This condition has been kept to give this idea.
Okay.
But they are very dangerous people.
If they find out the truth..
There is one person who is very dangerous.
Lehri.
He is very smart.
But he has already said such a big lie..
..that now if he tells the truth, he will be the first one to die.
'Okay, so this is his family and not the Modi family.'
Mr. Balidaan.
Balidaan.
The poor thing is standing as a statue.
Fine, I will bring it into life.
Brother.
Brother.
Brother.
I have come here to tell you a secret.
Here he is.
Here he is.
You are doing pushups?
No, I'm pushing the ground down.
Keep guiet.
Keep guiet.
Tell me, who am I?
Am I God?
Am I a human being?
Who am I?
You are the first God with has been made by this human being.
What not have you made me?
Now even I have forgotten who I am.
I have become the Aamir Khan in the movie 'Gajani'.
Look here.
Look at this.
You have no idea how difficult it is to write on your back!
Rascal.
You played such a big game with a genius like me..
..who has written such a famous book?
Give me the book, please.
Here you go, genius.
I won't let you win as long as I am alive.
What will I do?
Mr. Balli, Mr. Chaudhary is calling you.
Go.
You have been summoned.
Yes.
Yes, I've put the ball in the hole.
I've learnt to play golf.
This is how we used to play marbles as well.
You are right.
- Greetings, sir.
Come.
Come, Mr. Balidaan.
Come.
You summoned me?
We have known each other since ages.
Why don't we turn this acguaintance into a relationship?
I didn't get you.
Your nephew Prem and our niece Sanjana.
Let's get them married.
- No.
No, this marriage cannot take place.
Why not?
You are a servant.
We are your employer.
You don't like the respect we are giving you?
Hello.
Why cannot this marriage take place, uncle?
We are their loyal servants.
We have to pay them back in someway or the other.
Right, uncle?
- Don't touch me.
You see, the girl has a loan of100 crores over her head.
That too of the World Bank.
Who will pay it back?
You?
We will pay it back.
We are going to get millions from the Modis.
You can keep 100-125 out of it.
Not 125, only 100 crores.
The amount of the loan.
After that even if you sent your daughter..
..without any clothes on, we will accept her.
Great.
Right, uncle?
We accept it, don't we?
- Yes.
Sanjana, my child..
I accept this match, uncle.
Uncle, your teeth will break if you will grind them so hard.
Mr. Chaudhary, there is a problem.
This Lehri keeps saying that Sanjana..
..had eloped with a boy during her wedding.
If someone comes to know about it on my wedding day..
..then my uncle will be defamed.
Can you please take care of this Lehri, sir?
Go and find Lehri.
Get him here.
Yes, Mr. Chaudhary?
Who eloped with Sanjana?
- This..
What is this that you are asking me?
I had shown you the photograph.
A lie.
You are lying.
He had eloped with Sanjana.
You are right.
He had eloped with her.
Forgive me, I had lied.
He is the one I had given a lift to.
Henceforth, this is what you should tell everyone.
Got it?
Are you happy now, Prem?
Yes, Mr. Chaudhary.
Mr. Lehri, you don't know what a big favour..
..you have done to my uncle and the Chaudhary family.
God will surely send you to heaven.
Congratulations, Balli.
You became their that.
What is it?
Yes, their relative.
Mr. Modi, you are the one who gave us this idea.
Otherwise, how could we ever think of this?
Have this.
Why did you unnecessarily take the that.
Trouble.
You go and have your meal.
We'll all have together.
No, we don't know how long we will take.
Why should you stay that because of us?
Hungry.
Go, have your meal.
Okay.
- I love you.
That's great, Mr. Modi.
At your place the women eat before the men do.
At our place, till we do eat, the women will die but..
..not touch the food.
This is wrong.
Look, women live in a very that world.
Small.
It begins from and ends at us.
The house and kids.
She is that in them.
What is it said?
Yes, restricted.
Hence it is our duty to look after them.
We should love them.
We should always keep them that.
We should keep them happy.
Radhika..
What happened?
Nothing.
You have your meal.
Before you?
So what?
If I drink all night along..
..will you stay hungry till the morning?
What is wrong with you, today?
Love.
I love you.
Sorry.
Shalu.
Shalu?
- Yes, Shalani.
Now I will always call you Shalu.
And henceforth, you can eat before me.
Why so?
- Because I love you.
Thank you.
Brother, Prem is nowhere to be seen.
Sanjana is not here either.
They got what they wanted.
The lovebirds must be busy at some corner.
Yes, so what is wrong in that?
They both that to each other.
They love each other.
They are going to get married.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Come, let's go and have some food.
Come on.
Look, Prem and Sanjana are also back.
Come on.
The bride and the groom are also here.
Let me make an announcement.
I have decided that this marriage won't take place.
What?
What?
Once again uncle must have gone into the 100 crore loop..
..after having a little too much to drink.
Balli, what are you saying?
Keep guiet.
Keep guiet.
You are saying Balli and sacrificing me
This marriage won't take place.
If uncle doesn't want this marriage to take place then..
Without uncle, I don't want to marry like an orphan.
Since when did you become an orphan, you liar?
Here he is.
Your father is here in a three-piece suit.
He is here.
Fine.
Fine.
Fine, Ballu.
If you are breaking your that with him.
Then I will form a that with him.
What is it?
Yes, a relationship.
Henceforth, I am your father.
And I am your mother.
I'm your uncle.
I'm your aunt.
If you are falling short of relatives then I, too, shall become one?
Why..
Why would you become anyone?
You are his uncle.
Keep it fixed.
Then it is fixed.
- Yes.
Henceforth, I am his uncle.
- And I am his aunt.
Look at that.
They all are telling the truth.
Chaudharys, can't you see the truth?
Brother.
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't do this.
Don't do this.
No matter how he is, he is my uncle.
My real uncle.
I'll make him understand.
Uncle, you saw how many relatives I have now?
It won't make a difference if I have one uncle less.
Yes, uncle.
On one hand your final rites will be performed..
..and on the other my wedding ceremony.
Correct.
- But this wedding will surely take place.
Yes, so I will prepare for the wedding.
- Yes.

By the way, Prem..
- Yes?
Have you come here to show the necklace..
..your family has bought for her or to see Sanjana?
I had come to congratulate all of you.
This is the first love marriage taking place in your family.
Yes, of course.
Aryan.
You came from the hospital on the right day.
Come, I'll introduce you to Sanjana's future husband.
Don't you want to get ready?
- Ready?
Come on, go.
Go.
- I am ever ready.
Ask Sanjana.
Prem.
Prem, look who is here.
He is the one.
He is the one who hit me with his car.
I went into coma because of him.
He was the one who eloped with Sanjana.
Look, Veer, Yuvraj.
Sanjana and Prem love each other.
That means everyone is a part of Prem's conspiracy.
I'll take care of you later, you wrenched woman.
We will first..
..take care of you.
You are flying too high.
Do you love to fly?
Yes, we do.
- What will you do?
Nothing, boys.
I'll just help you fulfil your dream.
You..
Where shall I keep it?
We will have to tell brother-in-law about his true identity.
Fools, not the true identity, but a false one.
Never underestimate three things in life.
I, me and myself.
Thank you.
No one can deport the one who has the family's support.
I am someone who can drown a fish.
What can you three.. do to me?
Go, Veer.
Go, Yuvraj.
I'll see how he stops you.
Let's go.
You are sleeping even after coming out of coma?
Do you remember your name?
Aryan.
- Aryan, go into flashback.
And see what I had done to you.
Where did he go?
He left right in front of you.
Mr. Modi.
- Yes.
Mr. Modi.
- What happened?
Mr. Modi.
- What happened?
We know the truth about that scoundrel Prem.
He is not Balli's nephew.
So?
- He isn't the real Modi either.
He is my real uncle.
A Kapoor.
Uncle.
- Yes, nephew.
Uncle.
- Uncle, catch them.
We'll see you.
- We'll see you.
Prem, I'll go with you.
- You handle the ladies inside.
I'm a Modi.
I'm a Modi.
I'm a Modi.
Aryan.
Aryan, let's go.
Save us.
Save us.
One.. two.. three.
The keys.
The keys are with me.
Take it.
Come here..
Come here..
That way.
That way.
Side effects of too much rajma chawal (a rice dish).
Sorry.
O God!
Card.
Card.
- Thank you.
Call me.
No pee me.
Pee them.
Hey, stop peeing there.
Stop him.
Stop him.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Stop there.
Let's go fast.
You are a dead man.
We won't spare you.
What's this new drama.
Bye-bye!
Amar.
Sanjana reminds me of our sister Shibani today.
Yes, brother.
Our Sanjana looks so happy.
I'm ready to go to the moon for her.
What?
Uncle, looking at her I feel that I won't even need..
..the almond flavoured milk.
Dad.
You know there is a that.
A custom.
Yes, but till date I've never got that of that custom.
A need.
You, too?
- Yes.
Stop this wedding.
Dear good people, someone stop them.
Aryan, you are back from the hospital.
But who did this to you?
That beguiler, Prem.
We have been cheated in such a big way.
Why did you do this to us?
Why?
Mr. Chaudhary, this was Sanjana's mother's desire.
And there was a belief in her wish.
Her wish was that you two get Sanjana married..
..and give her your blessings.
And she believed that..
..you two brothers will unite because of this marriage.
That means you really made a fool out of us.
You cheated us with 500 crores.
That means he is not a Modi.
And they are your uncles.
Listen, you idiots.
That's what I've been telling you since so long.
But you didn't listen to me.
You didn't listen to me as well.
Then tell them now.
No, you only tell them.
God sent you down here but He forgot to give you any brains.
You didn't change even after seeing the goodness in him?
But I have changed.
From now on I will be a true uncle to Prem.
Let me see who tries to touch my nephew.
Come on.
Coming.
Here you go.
You will touch my nephew.
No, I am here to give you a hand, sir.
- Okay.
Sir, being with them till date I have only washed cars.
Being with you, I am sure I will thrash a person or two.
Great.
Great.
Come on, let's begin the thrashing.
We are the five good men..
..and you are the two evil uncles.
Hippo Amar Chaudhary, you will get crushed in their fight.
Come here.
Fools, what are you waiting for?
Shoot them all.
We have come to attend the wedding.
We support love and not hatred.
Prem has changed us.
By giving double the money.
Let's go, hired goons.
Traitors.
Prem, you continue.
It's inauspicious to stop that in the middle.
That.. that..
- The wedding vows.
The wedding vows.
The wedding vows.
Come on.
Let's go.
Priest, hurry up.
Otherwise, my father and the rest of them will get thrashed.
Come.
Can I hold it?
Shall I start walking?
Come on, son.
Priest, please hurry up.
I'll shut down your World Bank.
Fast.
Fast.
I'm safe.
No.
This will be fine, Choudhary.
This is too much.
Prem, you can get another wife..
..but you won't get another father.
Today, for the first time a woman has said something sensible.
Go, Prem.
Prem, you won't get a better chance to remove your shirt.
Show your body.
- I won't.
Why?
- He has become fat.
Fat.
What shall I say?
Enjoyed it?
Mr. Chaudhary, I am here to form relations..
..and not to break bones.
Anyway, at our place we don't even look into the eyes of senior citizens.
Raising a hand on them is a farfetched thing.
Hence, chill and relax, Mr. Chaudhary.
Chill and relax.
Saw that?
This is what is called good values.
But are miles away from it.
Yes, you only know the meaning of greed..
..selfishness and deception.
You didn't even bother about my mother, you deceased sister.
How low will you stoop for money?
My child is absolutely right.
On one hand this boy is making sacrifices for his future wife.
And on the other it's you guys..
..who since ages have been making your wives sacrifice.
I'm feeling ashamed..
..to call both of you my sons.
Shame on you.
Disgusting.
Hey old man, have you lost your mind.
Father.
Get up, father.
Father..
Don't you dare!
He is our father.
I will cut your hand if you even touch him.
And I will break your jaw if you misbehave with him.
He lied.
He cheated everyone.
And you are..
They aren't even Modis.
What difference does the name make, son?
A person is known for his deeds.
And then, when have we ever acted like Chaudharys?
We have instead demeaned the Chaudhary name.
They are the real Chaudharys.
No, we are very satisfied being Kapoors.
How can he be a Chaudhary?
He has made us fight.
Brother-in-law, we should take revenge from him.
Revenge for what?
We should seek revenge because he made us human?
We should seek revenge because..
..by changing relations he changed us.
We brothers have been enemies since ages.
But today when our father got hurt our hearts felt the pain.
Should we seek revenge for that?
We should learn from this family.
Just being a part of a family doesn't make you a dear one.
A member is a dear one when you accept him.
Sir.
Sorry.
Sir..
We hold our ears and say..
..that we will never act like goons again.
And we will never be greedy for money.
And one more thing, sir.
Mr. Modi, what is your original surname.
Kapoor.
Kapoor.
- Mr. Kapoor, please forgive us.
And accept us.
Let us be a part of this wedding along with our girl, please.
Madam.
Chaudharys plus Kapoors eguals to Chapoors.
Mrs. Chapoor.
Oh, my, Mrs. Chapoor.
Someone stop her.
Ready?
Ready!
One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Ready.

'That's Prem's uncle, Bharat Kapoor.'
'And his wife, Suman.'

Khushi would have never agreed..
..if he wouldn't have reasoned it out with her.
- Right.
'Khaman Dhokla'.
- 'Khaman Dhokla'..
- Brother..
Gaurav had gone inside to meet Khushi for two minutes.
Half an hour has passed by.
Go and check what's happening.
The auspicious hour is passing by.
- Really?
'It is their friend and neighbour Mr. Pathak's daughter's wedding..'
'..whose name co-incidentally is Khushi.'
Khushi.
Khushi, my child.
Where are you?
Son-in-law.
Son-in-law.. what happened?
Who did all this?
Where is Khushi?
She ran away.
- She ran away?
She ran away with her lover.
- Lover?
Who is her lover?
Your neighbour, the Kapoors..
Their pampered, spoilt, rascal, scoundrel son.

Documents?
- Ready.
Witness?
Ready, sir.
The bride?
- Ready.
The groom?
- He's ready as well.
Then sign here.
- Okay.
Thank you.
Take this.
Here you go.
Exchange the garlands.
You are now husband and wife.
Click a photograph.
Just a second.
Click it.
Click it.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I was not in town.
If you wouldn't have helped her run away..
..her father would have got her married to someone else.
Yes.
And I would have become someone else's wife.
Not a chance.
Here's my card.
You are a registrar here.
We know.
No, no, no.
This is my other card.
I'm also a divorce lawyer.
I've dissolved more marriages than I've performed.
And looking at the two of you I feel..
..that you will definitely need me in future.
I know love is blind.
But marriage makes everyone see things clearly.
Do you see things clearly?
I'm still blind.
I've already married thrice.
I'm waiting to get married for the fourth time.
What kind of a man is he?
- Thank you.
Let's go.
Let's go.
We don't want your card.
Sir.
Sir, at least take the card.
Sir..
Who is he?
- He was getting married to her.
Look, brother, she was being forcefully to marry you.
And that's why..
- Forget it.
I was being forced to marry her.
What?
- I had come to tell Khushi that I love Kiran.
But I didn't get a chance to talk.
I was hit with a stick on my head and I fell unconscious.
I won't spare you.
- Brother, no..
Stop it, Gaurav.
Stop it.
We should thank them.
- Yes.
We wouldn't be together if he wouldn't have helped Khushi elope.
Say thanks.
Kiran.
- Hi.
How are you?
Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
Hurry up, the two of you.
Come here and get married.
I have to go and get someone divorced.
Let's go.
It's time for our flight as well.
We'll make a move.
Thank you so much.
- See you.
Take care.
Brother Prem.
- What?
Brother Prem, everyone inside..
Pathak shitting petrol.
Shitting?
- Seating sofa.
Oh, seating.
- Yes.
Okay.
You parking bike.
I'm seeing how much shitting.
He is here.
He is here.
He is here.
I'll set myself on fire.
I'll kill myself.
This drama has been going on since last night.
Neither is he sleeping nor is he letting us sleep.
Whenever he dries a little he wets himself again with petrol.
Mr. Pathak, if you wish to set yourself on fire..
..please do so outside, in the garden.
Why are you burning our house with you?
- Quiet.
Yes, exactly.
You heard that?
You heard that?
After ruining my family he is talking about his house.
Daddy, why don't you dive and snatch it?
Shut up.
You have done that.
- Awrong thing.
Awrong thing.
Yes.
- Stay away.
Stay away.
Stay away.
I'll set myself on fire.
Brother..
- Stay away.
Stay away.
Stay away.
Brother, Khushi is notjust your daughter but his friend as well.
Yes.
- Yes.
I'm sure she must have seen something special in Raju.
I'm sure the day you see them happy, you will forgive them.
That day will never come in my life.
And there are hardly any days left in my life.
Perhaps not even one.
Yes.
He is right.
He is right, right?
Then keep this aside.
I'll commit suicide.
- You..
I'll commit suicide.
- Who are you threatening?
I'll help you.
Does anyone have a lighter?
No, I don't have it.
This lighter..
- You started smoking?
- You started smoking?
Shame on you.
- Brother, I didn't..
Don't change the topic.
What were you saying?
I'll help you deep fry.
What are you doing?
Prem?
- What is this?
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Prem?
Prem?
Prem?
- Will Mr. Pathak's death affect anyone of you?
No.
- No.
- Will the world end?
What..
What..
What..
I will burn him down.
Okay.
I won't spare you.
I won't spare you.
- Prem.
Prem.
You'll ruin everything.
- Prem.
Something has to be done about this boy.
Hello, Guru.
Hello.
- Come.
Come, Ram.
Have a seat.
Have a seat.
Look, Ram..
- Yes?
Prem has done a good deed by uniting two lovers.
Guru, he ended brother and Mr. Pathak's age old friendship.
Yes.
- Prem that's the talks of his marriage even before it starts.
What is it called?
- Ends.
- He ends it.
Last month Guru sent a dog to your place, right?
Yes.
She is very nice.
- Yes.
She keeps everyone happy.
- Yes.
He sent two maids for household chores.
Naina and Sunaina.
They are very nice girls.
But cannot get Prem married to them.
- Right.
Right.
Similarly, Guru has found a bride for Prem.
Ram, listen to me.
You know the Malhotras from America..
Yes.
- Their daughter is perfect for Prem.
Yes.
She is a Bandit Queen.
A Bandit Queen?
- A Bandit Queen?
Phoolan.
- Only her behavior.
She is very good at heart.
Her name is Pooja.
- Wonderful!
She is the only girl who can change Prem.
Guru, then why are you doing that in this?
Why are you delaying this?
- Why the delay?
She is coming to Bangkok tomorrow for her friend's wedding.
It will be great if Prem likes her.
Whether Prem likes her or not..
..only Pooja will come to our house as that.
What?
- A bride.
- A bride.
A bride.
- Yes.
Hello.
- Karan, I've been trying all six numbers of yours since so long.
Tell me what happened to the wedding.
I ran away from the wedding.
But my passport is with them.
What?
It'll take at least 10-15 days to make a new passport.
But what will I do in the meanwhile?
They will find me.
I'll call you later.
- Hello!
Hello!
Hi, Pooja.
Do you need a ride?
No, thank you.
Prem and his uncle are coming to fetch me.
Prem, Pooja is coming at Terminal 3..
..why are we standing at Terminal 7?
That's the game plan.
- Why are you throwing it?
How will Pooja recognize us?
That's what I want.
She shouldn't recognize us.
Why
What are you doing?
What is this..
This.. is a proof for my father that we went to the airport..
..but Pooja Malhotra didn't come here.
So we came here..
- Uncle, tell me one thing.
Neither you nor I have ever seen her.
Nor has anyone in the family has seen her.
Guru has sent an imported Pooja Malhotra from America..
..so that she marries me and changes me?
- Correct.
Uncle, I need a very impish, roguish and talented wife.
Impish, roguish and talented?
But nowadays it's so difficult to find..
..an impish, roguish and talented wife.
All of them are married.
I am there.
But what will tell our Guru?
Let the Guru's mother go to hell.
Does he have a sister?
- Yes.
Then we shall send both of them.
- Okay.
Both mother and sister will go to hell.
Prem.
Who called me Prem so hatefully?
What did you think?
I will wait for you at Terminal 3?
And you will click a photograph here..
,and fool father?
- Pooja.
How did you recognize us?
Not you, him.
Daddy had given his description when I was leaving America.
I scanned the entire airport.
He was the only rogue with an innocent face.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
What an image you have, Prem.
I'm proud of you.
Why are you in a wedding dress?
What did you think?
I'll come from America in a two-piece bikini?
It would've been better.
- Just shut up.
Come on!
Let's go.
Excuse me.
Don't take advantage of the situation.
And don't you dare touch me.
Let's go.
Wow.
Impish, roguish and talented.
I should have asked for something else, uncle.
What better could have you asked for?
Think about it.
Ayoung and old imp at home.
And they will bet on who is more impish.
Your aunt and she will get along well.
Truly.
I'll bet on your girl.
They are here.
Pooja is here.
Pooja is here.
Brother, is she Pooja?
Or has he brought some other girl from her wedding?
You all must be surprised, right?
Seeing me dressed as a bride.
You see, a girl looks her best in a wedding dress.
So, I told myself, "Pooja, don't take a chance."
"If you want to impress everyone.."
"..then go dressed as a bride.
- Very impressed."
Impish.
Okay, tell me, how did you like our Prem?
Yes.
How did you like you?
I liked all of you a lot.
Very talented.
And if all of you support me then..
..we will change him for good as well.
Talented also.
- Okay.
Then all of us are with you.
Come in.
Come in.
Come in.
- Come in, dear.
She will change him for good.
She didn't bring any bags with her.
What was the need to bring any luggage?
I'm not staying in a hotel.
I'm staying with my in-laws.
There is anything lacking in here?
Yes, only that like you was lacking.
That..
What?
- What do you call a son's that?
Daughter-in-law.
- We were only lacking a daughter-in-law..
..and now your presence has changed that as well.
Your father has become that.
- Mad?
Should I tell your father?
You are saying such things about my elder brother?
Yes?
Tell us, when are you going for the wedding?
I just ran from a wedding.
You ran away from it?
But you were going to Phuket for your friend's wedding, right?
Yes, I was going to.
What do you mean, "I was going to?"
If you didn't go there then how did you ran away from it?
By ran away I mean I got rid of it with great difficulty.
Why would I unnecessarily waste my time in Phuket?
That's right.
Why waste time in Phuket?
If I would attend my friend's wedding..
..then how would I make arrangements for my wedding?
And I have to fulfil the responsibility Guru has given me.
She will marry you.
She is wishful-serpent.
I will never let her wish come true.
Sir, Pooja's on the line.
Pooja?
- Pooja?
It's for Pooja.
Give it to me.
Hello.
Hi.
How are you?
I'm standing at the airport since the last two hours..
..and you are asking how are you?
I'm not okay, understand?
My friend.
The one who is getting married.
She is very angry.
Anyway, look, I am waiting at the airport, come on.
And he didn't come to pick me up.
- Didn't get the time.
I have come here from America and he didn't get the time?
If you don't believe me then talk to Prem's dad.
I?
- Dad, she is calling all of you.
Tell her that you all are not free.
- Yes.
Look, we cannot come.
We don't have that.
Tell her that we don't have a car.
- No, we have a car.
The thing that moves like this.
Pendulum.
- We don't have a pendulum.
Excuse me?
- Time.
No, we don't have time.
Sorry.
Heard that?
Now do you believe me?
If you don't have time then even I am not stupid..
..to waste my time for you over here.
I'm going to attend my friend's wedding.
And I'll go to Guru's ashram after 8-10 days.
If you finally have the time and you wish to meet me..
..then you can come there.
Understand?
Okay.
That's a great idea.
Bye.
Come, Pooja, I'll take you to the guestroom.
Aunt, am I a guest that I'll stay in the guest room?
I'll stay in Prem's room.
In Prem's room?
- Before this?
Before marriage?
Until we get married, Prem will stay in the guestroom.
Yes.
Don't worry about him.
He can also sleep on a table.
Look, he is sleeping.
Ma'am, if you want to stay then stay in the guestroom..
..otherwise, I'll make you disappear in such a way..
Prem.
- Daddy, my room..
Uncle, cool down.
Now I am here.
I'll handle it.
Now look here, my future husband.
For now, I have just snatched your room.
After that I'll snatch your sleep and peace of mind as well.
I'll make you empty.
Empty.
You..
- No abusing.
Come, aunt.
Show me my room.
Go.
Go.
Show it to her.
- I'll be right back.
Brother, she will set him straight.
Isn't she very delicate?
- She is a lizard.
A lizard.
I don't know where that girl is.
I'm telling the truth.
You lost her.
My men couldn't find her.
Where did she go?
She doesn't know anyone in the city.
And no one knows her.
Where can she go?
Where can she go?
Where?
Where?
Hit him.
I want her at any cost before Suraj Chaudhary to her.
Someone stop me.
She is one piece from head to toe.
How do I cut her into pieces?
Prem, control your mind.
I'll control my mind but..
This girl with a face that looks a mix of banana and mango..
If you scream this Rampuri dagger will take to straight to Lord Rama.
You are taking advantage of the situation.
Situation?
Advantage?
Again?
She will yak and force someone..
..to think about it even if he isn't in the mood.
But what will you gain by killing me?
The CEO of fools, I won't benefit from it, you will.
I'll double your value.
- What?
How much is a live chicken worth?
- Rs.100.
And how much is a Tandoori chicken worth?
- 200.
So doesn't that double the value after death?
You will snatch my peace of mind?
You will snatch my room?
If you don't leave by tomorrow morning..
..then I swear by Baba Ramdev..
..I will kill you.
What happened?
- What happened, dear?
What happened?
- What happened?
What happened?
She must have had a nightmare.
She must have screamed.
A lot can happen in a nightmare.
Like..
Yes, a sneeze.
I was dreaming?
- Look, she is agreeing.
Come on, go back to sleep.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- She was dreaming.
Let us know if you need anything.
- Let's go.
Okay, goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Never underestimate three things in life.
Shucks..
Me, me and me.
Now you only bloody decide whether..
..you have to come to this house in a palanquin..
..or you want to leave this house.. as a dead person.
"Oh, Lord of the whole universe."
"Mighty Lord of the whole universe."
"All Thy devotees' agonies.."
"All Thy devotees' sorrows.."
"Instantly Thou banish."
"Oh, Lord of the whole universe."
Great.
I feel I am going to have a great day in office.
After all my day began with such a nice prayer.
You have been named aptly.
We are feeling as if we are in Hardiwar.
- Yes.
We have got such a nice daughter-in-law.
Dear, you are so cultured and you have such good values..
..in spite of living in America.
Bush taught Obama and Obama taught her.
So who is her mother is in America?
Obama?
Listen..
To celebrate Pooja arrival we will distribute that in the office.
That..
- Tennis ball?
No, not that.
- Paperweight.
'Ladoo' (Indian sweet).
Right, brother?
Yes. 'Ladoos'.
We will distribute 'Ladoo'.
We will distribute 'Ladoos'.
Yes, they are round as well.
The world is also round.
Should we distribute that?
- No, no, no.
What kind of people there are in the world, uncle.
Of different types.
They neither pray in the morning nor go to work.
Yes.
- True, dear.
There are such people as well.
What times have come!
There's a demon staying in a God's house.
I'll have to use my demonic mind.
Uncle.
- What happened?
What happened?
What happened?
- Nothing.
It's a small injury.
Should I seek revenge?
Here you go.
Mother Earth.
Bad mummy.
Bad mummy, Mother Earth.
- Sorry, uncle.
He was trying to make me fall but you fell instead.
But why was he trying to make you fall?
Anger.
I said a few true things and he got angry.
He got irritated.
Why get irritated with it?
She is telling the truth.
He is always either on his bike or his skates.
Otherwise he keeps building his body in the spare time.
Why are you ruining my healthy body?
Everyone is saying something or the other..
..don't you have to say something?
God sent him here to increase the burden on earth.
You are telling the truth for the first time.
We have been given a life..
..only so that he can disgrace us.
Absolutely right.
- He is a big disgrace.
You have a great sense of honour, uncle.
Even a Satan will look like a God in front of him.
Great.
- Wonderful.
He is..
- I think I'll have to tell aunt about your affair, uncle.
I'm not saying it from my heart.
Don't take it to your heart.
My hand broke.
- Be careful.
Be careful.
Be careful.
Take me to a hospital.
- We'll have to do something about her.
She's digging a grave for you.
What happened?
- I cannot move it.
I'll handle her.
Because uncle, once she is gone, life is fun.
Great, Pooja.
Great.
- Enough.
It is delicious.
- Fantastic.
- She cooks so well.
- Yes.
Outstanding.
Outstanding.
Yes.
- And she sings so well.
- Yes.
And she is also changing our spoilt brat for good.
- Yes.
Look, he is here.
Son, your name is Prem (love) and not 'Hatred'.
Right?
- Really?
Hey, listen.
Hello.
- Sit.
Madam, go.
Go to the airport.
Come on.
Why?
- Your father has sent a parcel for you.
From USA.
- Yes, so why are you giving me the news?
You should have collected it for me.
He is useless.
You sing so well.
You cook so well.
What would have happened if you had studied a little as well?
The officer there won't give the parcel to me without your signature.
You only will have to go there.
How will the poor girl go to airport alone?
You go with her, Prem.
Am I her driver, chauffer or servant?
Brother.
- Prem, you go with her.
Daddy, you are very that.
- I am very boring.
But still, you will go.
Go, dear.
Go.
Yes, but dad didn't inform me over the phone.
Oh, fax.
- What?
He has sent a fax, you dirty mind.
Why are you wasting time talking, Prem?
The parcel will go back.
Come on, leave.
Go.
Please go, son.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Be careful.
I think he's up to something.
I have a mobile.
I'll call if anything happens.
Only if he will let you call.
'I could've easily spent 10-12 days in this house..'
'..if he wouldn't have been born here.'
'She has made my family crazy about her in two days.'
'I would be dead if she would stay for 12 days.'
'He cannot stop taking advantage.'
'We take advantage of those we would gain something from.'
'I am just trying to get rid of her.'
'Airport is on the left and he is taking a right turn.'
'Is he planning to take me to the jungle and..'
'No, madam.
If I do any such thing..'
'..then I'll get stuck with you forever.'
'Then I will have to marry you.'
'Then why is he taking me to a jungle?
'
'Will he leave me amidst wild animals?
'
'I would have if I wasn't so concerned about the poor animals.'
'I think I'll have to show her a few lions.'
How can you even think of such a thing?
What are you doing?
Where are the keys?
- I threw it.
The steering wheel got locked.
Why did you throw it?
Are you a woman or what?
I'm a woman.
- If you are a woman..
..then you should have kept the keys here, like a woman.
Keys are not kept there.
Keys are kept around the waist.
To hell with your 26" waist.
I can see a six and a half foot grave there.
Move the steering wheel.
No, steering wheel has failed.
The steering wheel has failed.
Your mind has failed.
But the brakes didn't fail, right?
- No, they didn't.
Prem.
- She's gone.
- Prem.
Prem.
Prem.
Prem.
Where are you?
- I am here.
Down here.
She was hanging me, now God has hanged her.
Are you dead or alive?
I'm still alive, but I can die anytime.
Help me.
- Okay.
Take this.
Take my hand.
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come closer first.
No, I am thinking that it's better..
..if one person dies rather than two.
Coward.
Dastard.
Pansy.
Chicken.
Should I come there to help you so that you can help me?
Let me ask help for myself first.
Hurry up.
- Help me, God.
Give me your leg.
- You are already hanging.
How else should I hang you?
I mean give me your leg.
Leg?
Man and woman look good in pair.
But to touch something with ones' leg is a grave sin.
You are hanging on the branch with both your hands.
How will you save me?
Ma'am, each hand of mine has 2 times a gorilla's strength.
Depending on age and size.
By the way, I can save you with one hand.
Then Useless, use that hand.
Hold my waist and pull me.
No, no, no.
Not the waist.
Then you will say that I took advantage.
What?
- By the way your waist is..
Let my waist go to hell.
Hold whatever you want.
Do whatever you want.
But please save me.
In that case, come to me, my suitcase.
Look madam, you are taking advantage of my disadvantage.
- What?
If you come any closer, then I swear..
..I'll let go of both the hands and embrace you.
And both of us will be dead.
Please save me.
Let's go.
What are you doing?
Just hanging around.
Don't worry.
You women are amazing.
You cannot stick on to anything other than your age.
Sometimes you say take the advantage..
..sometimes you say don't take advantage.
What nonsense is this?
All your yakking is making me go crazy.
It was the demand of the situation.
I wasn't wrong to touch you now.
I was wrong to touch you earlier.
If this is not wrong then why is that wrong?
And if that is wrong then why isn't this wrong?
Actually, you are wrong.
It is wrong to sit here and talk to you.
It's of no use.
I'll lie down.
Obviously it's of no use.
I'm sitting and you are lying down.
It would've benefited if either, both of us were sitting or lying down.
Look, don't say double meaning things to me.
This is a limit to illiteracy.
Where is a double meaning in it?
Look, don't turn and sleep like this.
I feel something inside.
By the way, the jean fits well..
..on your waist.
My ill-fate I wish he wasn't a man.
And you weren't a woman.
Sanjana Singh.
Pooja has horns.
Prem!
'Prem.
Prem.
Prem.'
Isn't it a great place?
You call out once and it echoes back a number of times.
You have brought me here to hear this?
Oh, no.
This is nothing.
Now I'll shout your name and see what name echoes back.
Should I?
Sanjana!
'Sanjana.
Sanjana.
Sanjana.'
Hear it.
'Sanjana.
Sanjana.
Sanjana.'
I'm saying Pooja and it is echoing back as Sanjana.
Isn't it a strange place?
Look, the valley is so deep.
Prem.
- Only echoes come back from here, not people.
Tell me the truth.
Who are you?
Otherwise, I'll let go of you.
I'll tell you the truth.
Pull be back first.
Come on, start your story.
You already know my real name.
Sanjana Singh.
Actually, I had come from America to get married.
But the guy I was going to get married to..
..turned out to be a famous don's son.
I ran away from the wedding but they snatched my passport.
It takes at least 10-12 days to make a new passport.
I needed a place to hide as well.
Then I saw you at the airport.
You had come to pick up Pooja and no one knew Pooja.
So I thought..
You know the rest.
- I know the rest.
What did you do with the real Pooja?
I hope you didn't murder her.
No.
She has gone to attend her friend's wedding, in Phuket.
She will go to Guru's ashram from there.
Guru.
Guru.
Guru.
He is a..
Let's go.
Prem.
Hey, move aside.
"My heart broke."
"My heart broke."
"My heart went crazy."
I think you want me..
..to give you a lift.
You are very handsome and dashing..
..brother.
- Brother?
This car won't go anywhere.
It has broken-down.
Why?
What happened, darling?
Darling?
- The car will run.
It will get repaired.
I'm a mechanic.
It's my job.
Hope in.
Yes.
- But you didn't ask me where you should drop me.
I haven't caught you as yet, to drop you.
First let me introduce myself.
I'm Mr. Lehri.
I'm sure you know Bhappi Lehri.
There is no connection between us.
Yes, there is a connection.
He likes gold and I like to sleep.
Hello.
Why are you whistling?
You've already won over me.
Are you from Pataya?
Who is he?
Is he your boyfriend?
No, he is a distant friend.
- A distant friend?
Just like a distant relative.
Okay.
Then I have no problem..
..because I am shortsighted.
So shall we leave, Mr. Weak?
Hello.
I keep a person like you as my driver.
Really?
- Yes.
- Then give me the keys.
Come on.
The key is in its place.
I got a driver.
Come on, darling.
Come behind.
Come on.
Come on.
Watch your feet.
You aren't in the mood to come behind?
Not a problem.
We'll talk from here.
Great.
It's such a young and beautiful weather.
When I look at you I remember a romantic phrase.
Tell me.
Mingle in jungle.
I, too, remember a phrase when I see you.
A.K. Hangal in the jungle.
You know liquor and beauty have a deep connection?
I'm often intoxicated and the evening passes away.
There will be a day when the evening will be intoxicated..
..and you will pass away.
Hello.
I'm not here to get insulted.
Where do you usually go to get insulted?
Where will I go?
I stay at home.
I'm married.
You give a lift to a single girl even when you are married?
Who doesn't?
I only give, you take it as well, forcefully.
Watch out!
What is he doing up there?
Plucking fruits.
He plucked a lot of fruits.
Oh no!
- What have you done?
I didn't do it.
You did it.
Hard work paid off, didn't it?
You were driving very passionately.
Whose car is this?
- This is my car.
It's not a car.
It is my wife.
I love it.
If your wife has an affair with someone..
..then who will work hard on her?
Her lover, who else?
Who will enjoy it?
- My wife, who else?
Who will get punished?
- Me, who else?
So just imagine.
She is your wife.
Who was working hard on her?
- You.
Who was enjoying it?
- She was.
Who will get punished?
Me, who else?
Because it was my car.
Don't cry, my son.
Be strong.
The Lord works in mysterious ways, my son.
Have this fruit.
You are a Father?
Father.
Father, I had bad thoughts about her.
Father, I'm a sinner.
I've committed a grave sin, Father.
I am a sinner.
Hey!
Stop the car.
There's the girl.
What have I done!
- Prem, let's go.
They are his men.
Come.
- Come on.
Come on.
Fast.
Or she'll escape.
- I want to confess.
Where is that girl?
- Which girl?
The one who was standing here with you.
Your sister.
She..
Sister?
I think she ran away with brother-in-law.
Listen, have you seen our boss?
Who is your boss?
- Tall, board, huge man.
Okay, this..
What are you asking?
I'm selling these fruits here.
The fruits of hard work.
These fruits are very tasty.
Just taste them.
No.
I didn't.
My car hit him.
Get him.
- My car hit him.
Mr. Chaudhary, your son has gone into coma..
..because of excess blood loss.
I don't know when he will regain consciousness.
Quickly resuscitate him, Doctor..
..otherwise, I will sent you into coma.
Send me as well, sir.
To my home, sir.
Look, sir, it was my car but your son was hit by that boy.
I don't even now how to drive a car.
I swear on him.
Let him go.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
So sweet.
Yes.
Sir, I am leaving but before leaving..
..I would like to give you a small warning.
Sir, that boy is very smart.
He is fast, in driving cars and using his brain as well.
If he will come before you he will do such actions that..
..you will forget to give reactions.
Has anyone seen that boy?
Has anyone seen that boy?
I've only seen him from the left side.
And I've only seen him from the right side.
Sir, what is this left and right.
I've seen him from centre.
Will you be able to recognize him?
You are talking about recognizing?
Actually, I was born when I was small.
My mother was a woman.
And the person who murdered my father..
..underwent plastic surgery thrice.
Yet I recognized him.
Because he used to come to our shop to buy the plastic.
From now onwards, this plastic will always be with us.
Take him away.
- No.
This is wrong.
Shut up.
- This is wrong.
Find that boy and Sanjana.
Wherever they are hiding find them.
What?
- What kind of childishness is this, Pooja?
Is this a way to behave?
Does anyone hold and push anyone like this?
How was that?
- What did you do?
Like this..
Like this..
What did you do?
- What did I do?
You held her like this and pushed her like this.
The push she got had that.
The push she got had minimal effect?
- Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
Take your position.
- From there.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Come, come, one by one.
- Come on.
Come on.
Talk to your darling nephew.
- Yes.
From the time they have returned from the jungle..
..there is a lot of fun happening around.
"It is fun.
It is fun.
It is fun."
"It is fun.
It is fun.
It is fun."
Excuse me.
Just friends.
- Play the wedding tune.
Just friends.
Prem!
Prem, your method was wrong but your intentions were good.
Now I have no complaints against you.
- Mr. Pathak.
No.
No.
No.
My Khushi is so happy with Raju that I forgot all my sorrows.
Great.
Great.
Great.
- That's great.
You know I'm going to London.
Raju sent the tickets.
- Of economic class?
Yes.
- Yes.
How do you know that?
- Because I gave Raju the idea.
I told him not to buy first class tickets as you are such a miser..
..that you will be happy even with economic class ticket.
What happened?
- It got wet.
- What?
What is this, Daddy?
You always say double meaning things.
There is no double meaning in it.
The thing which we talk.
With which..
Mobile.
Mobile.
Mobile.
- Mobile?
My purse.
- My money.
My purse.
Your underwear.
Let's get out of this.
Today, I got that and after a long time that happened.
You got wet and fell in love?
No, I caught cold.
Today, the Sunday truly feels like a Sunday.
A Sunday will always be a Sunday.
- Yes.
We never go in the swimming pool together even if we want to, right?
Really.
- Thank you, Pooja.
- You're welcome.
Welcome.
Thank you.
I am Ready.
But there is a No Entry here.
Someone stop me.
Sir.
Ajunior priest has come from Guru's place.
He is here?
- Yes.
Make him comfortable..
- Yes.
The junior priest is here.
I'll go meet him and welcome him.
My wallet..
From the drawer..
That one.
Yes.
And the wallet..
Priest, why are you here?
I mean what brings you here?
I'll tell that later, but Guru is very angry with you.
Why?
- Why didn't you go to pick up Pooja from the airport?
I had gone there..
..but I got a little late.
She left to attend the wedding.
Yes, she will be going to the ashram directly from the wedding.
Be there on time to pick her up.
- As you say.
Where is everyone else?
- They are with Pooja..
But Pooja is..
- Not this one, the Pooja which was sent last month.
We sent a dog last month..
- Don't call her a dog.
The family members have named her Pooja.
They have named her Pooja?
A dog..
- Again you are calling her a dog.
Doggie, dog, puppy, pup, Raju, Tommy.
Nothing.
Call her Pooja.
Otherwise with a broom..
They are so madly in love with her that nowadays we eat dog food..
Dog..
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Pooja's food.
Pedigree and White Kennel.
So what should I call her?
Pooja?
Don't call her that if you want to lose your loincloth..
..and your honour.
Hello, Priest.
They are here to serve you.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Bless you.
Bless you.
Guru had kept a 'Satyanarayan' ritual..
- Very good.
He has sent the offering of that.
Sanjana..
As soon as they call for Pooja you come with the dog.
Tell me, where is Pooja.
She is here.
Pooja.
Now what do I tell you, Priest.
We have got very attached to Pooja in such a short span.
She is so sweet that as soon as she came, Prem..
She won everyone's heart.
'Oh God, what magic has this dog done in one month?
'
Our Pooja is as decent as she is beautiful.
'A decent dog?
'
'Have they lost their mind?
'
She is now our family member.
Does she bite?
What kind of a joke is that?
Is she a suckling that she will bite?
She is of marriageable age.
It's a different thing if she starts biting after marriage.
Whether she bites, scratches or does anything else..
..we have decided that she'll be the daughter-in-law of our family.
'They will make a dog their daughter-in-law?
'
'A dog will be perfect for you, son.'
'You deserve this.'
What are you thinking about?
That is happening with Guru's permission.
'Dandiya', 'Garba' (Gujarati dance forms).
No, no, no.
That..
That..
That..
Yes.
The alliance.
- The alliance.
The alliance.
'I think they have gone absolutely crazy.'
'They didn't go to pick up the Pooja Guru had sent..'
'..from the airport.'
'They have named their dog Pooja..'
'..and they are getting him married to her.'
'I'll also go crazy if I stay here any longer.'
I'll make a move.
Have lunch before you leave.
- Yes.
Pooja's favourite dishes have been made today.
'Oh, God.
They are feeding dog food to a priest?
'
Look, I..
You can have it.
I'm fasting today.
I'll make a move.
- Bye.
- Okay, Priest.
- Okay, Priest.
Who is this girl?
You don't recognize her?
You are strange.
She is our maid.
You had brought her here from the ashram.
'Look at that.
These lunatics think I am crazy.'
'I hope I really don't go crazy.'
Excuse me.
I'll make a move.
Okay.
- Okay.
"Baby, I can see the sun rising in your eyes."
"Baby, every time I think of you, you make me smile."
"Baby, I'll be your every dream and you should know.."
"Baby, I'll never ever want to let you go."
"Love is the dawn of the slumber of life."
"Love is a very beautiful punishment."
"I have fallen in love."
"My prayers have been answered."
"Love is the dawn of the slumber of life."
"Love is a very beautiful punishment."
"I have fallen in love."
"My prayers have been answered."
"Come, let's go somewhere."
"Let's fly and go somewhere."
"Love is our sky."
"It is as open as our desires."
"An untouched feeling touched me."
"Like there is intoxication in the sky."
"I'm in love."
"I have fallen in love."
"My prayers have been answered."
"I have fallen in love."
"My prayers have been answered."
"My path tells this to me."
"Why don't you stray a little?"
"Now this journey is unique."
"Please ask my destination.."
"..to look out for my path from the shore."
"If you are with me.."
"..this journey is like a dream to me."
"My heart has been a bit troublesome."
"It has given me some beautiful problems."
"I have fallen in love."
"My prayers have been answered."
"Baby, I can see the sun rising in your eyes."
"Baby, every time I think of you, you make me smile."
"Baby, I'll never ever want to let you go."

Maids.
- Yes, brother.
Where is everybody gone?
Brother..
Gone ashram.
Meeting Guru.
And Pooja?
- Gone.. with them too.
Why, brother?
Heart beating fasting?
Brother, where are you running?
Come on, come on.
- Come.
This is Guru's that.
What is it called..
As..
Ashram.
We've come here to fix a wedding date for your marriage with Prem.
Yes.
Let's go.
You go ahead.
We'll come.
- Okay.
Pooja, it is believed that all wishes..
Come.
Which Pooja are you talking about, Ram?
Pooja has not returned from her friend's wedding.
Then who is the one who has been staying..
..in our house as Pooja since the past few days.
Who is the scoundrel you ran away with?
Kill his entire family.
How is that possible!
You want me, right?
I'm ready to come with you.
Let's go.
Come on.
Leave me.
Brother-in-law.
Sanjana is not here.
I knew that you would surely come.
And I, too, knew that you would say..
.."I knew that you would surely come."
Why should I come, huh?
Am I your boyfriend?
I love you?
- Saw?
You are agreeing to it.
No.
Really?
He's your uncle?
Yes.
Prem, how would I tell you that..
..these goons, mafias are my maternal uncles?
Great.
Your family members are like Charles Shobraj and Ranja Billa?
I love these mafia people.
Stop joking, Prem.
You don't know how much my uncles hate each other
My mother's last wish was..
..that I get both my uncles' blessings at my wedding.
So that their enmity ends forever..
..and they become good human beings like they were, earlier.
But?
- The greed of attaining my property worth 200 crores..
..increased their enmity.
Each one of them wants me to marry his brother-in-law.
200 crores?
I can draw a cheque without deducting the TDS..
..and keep your uncles in my pocket.
But my dear, until there are obstacles in a love story..
..it is not called a love story.
What stories will we tell our children?
Look, a boyfriend gets scared of his girlfriend.
A girlfriend gets scared of a cockroach.
A cockroach gets scared of a mouse.
A mouse gets scared of a cat.
A cat gets scared of a dog.
And a dog gets scared of a man.
- And a man is scared of a woman.
- What?
Just like a villain..
gets scared of the hero.
Prem, let's go.
My uncle is here.
What now?
They will..
- Don't worry, dear.
Today, I'll predict your future.
You will get married to an innocent looking rogue.
That's me.
Now can I take some advantage?
By the way, the fitting of the Indian dress is very good.
"Ready..
I am ready for you.
Are you ready for me?"
"Are you ready for me?
Are you ready for me?"
"Are you ready for me?
I am ready for you."
Uncle, Yuvraj was forcefully..
I ran away from there.
Sit in the car.
They are drying out.
This boy is making me that.
That..
Irritate?
- No, not irritate.
That..
This..
This..
Emotional?
- Emotional is like this.
This..
- So?
He is making me this.
This.
This..
Crazy.
- Crazy.
- Crazy.
He is making crazy.
Crazy.
Crazy.
He lied to me.
That girl is not this but that.
What..
- Not Sanjana, Pooja.
Pooja.
Yes.
Yes.
What you are thinking of doing is not so easy.
They are dangerous.
- Yes.
They are dons.
I would've said the same had I been in your place.
But.. what would've you done had you been in my place?
Why don't you make him understand?
What should I tell him?
All I know is that Sanjana is a very nice girl.
And right now, she must be in trouble.
She must be in big trouble.
That's true, sister-in-law.
But there is no solution to this problem.
I have such a solution that I'll make the lives of both the dons, hell.
They have a common CA, who has done BA.
And his name..
What was his name?
Sounds like bully.
- Idli (a south Indian snack)?
Mulli (Raddish)?
Pulley.
- Talli (drunk)?
No, close.
Close.
Khuli (open)?
Khali?
Khali.
Balli.
Balidaan Bhardwaj.
Sakku, how many times will you call me?
I feel that you call me even when you dial a wrong number.
What do I do?
You have left the house with so much cash.
I'm feeling scared.
This isn't the first time I'm out with so much cash.
I do transactions worth millions, day and night.
All 500 and 1000 denomination bills..
..across the world knows Balidaan Bhardwaj.
Then?
- That's fine.
But what if a thief stabs you and robs you?
Sakku, are you concerned about me..
..or are you trying to kill me?
Hang up, Sakku.
I want two demands drafts made.
One of30 lakhs and the other of20 lakhs.
Take this.
My bag?
My bag!
Where did my bag go?
Where is my bag?
There was 50 lakhs in the bag.
Where did the bag go?
My bag.
My bag got stolen.
Have you seen a thief here?
- No.
You blind man, you didn't see the thief?
.
You didn't even see such a big bag?
I didn't see it.
I'm not the owner of it.
You..
Have you seen your face?
It's so black that if shown on National Television..
..it will ward off evil from the entire country.
Sakku, what you said came true.
Sakku.
What happened?
Amar Chaudhary and Suraj Chaudhary's 50 lakhs got stolen.
What?
Don't do this.
Pack the bags.
It's time to leave the city.
Come on.
- Yes.
They are here.
Tell them I am not here.
I'll go and hide myself.
Mr. Bhardwaj.
Mr. Bhardwaj.
He has not only left this house but this world as well.
A trunk ran over him.
- Oh, no.
He got crushed.
Do you have anyone to look after you in this cruel world?
No.
By the way, I had brought this bag for him.
What will I do of this briefcase when he is no more?
Don't worry.
I'll take care of both his belongings.
Okay?
Let's meet after his final rites.
Bring it here.
Where are you going?
You are alive, sir?
- Yes, I'm alive.
It's her hobby.
She kills her husband over everything.
Start wearing a wedding chain from tomorrow.
People get mistaken.
She is mine.
And.. this bag is also mine.
There are only 50 lakhs in it, right, sir?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
There are only 50 lakhs..
Just a minute.
How did you come to know that there are 50 lakhs in it?
Just be looking at the bundle of the notes..
..I can predict how many notes it contains.
How?
- I learnt this art from my master.
Mr. B. B., sir.
Bishan Singh Bedi?
- No, sir.
Then?
Balibhrambhat.
- No, no, sir.
Bichun Bhutia.
Goal.
No way, sir.
The one who has written this book.
Mr. Balidaan Bhardwaj.
Be careful, sir.
I've written a book?
When did I write this book?
Such a fat book?
You?
- Yes.
Look at this.
The Balidaan in front of Bhardwaj is me.
That's me.
This is a sign of a genius.
You wrote a book and you don't even remember.
Sir, this book is a missile and you are an example..
..for a newcomer like me.
I have come to this city to be your assistant, sir.
I see.
- I want to learn the ropes of this job with you.
I don't want any money either.
- Then my job is done.
I mean your job is done.
- Thank you, sir.
I have only two clients.
Amar Chaudhary and Suraj Chaudhary.
Sir, they are mafias.
One is a mongoose.
And the other one is a snake.
If they get together then they are killer sharks.
But both of them are illiterates.
How many times during a year do you think..
..people like Chaudhary must be paying their taxes?
Sir, they must not even be paying the taxi fare.
Sir..
I make them pay tax every month.
Every month?
Again and again.
- Again and again.
12 times.
- 12 times.
Yes.
What do I do?
It is dirty but it is my business.
It is your business.
This is the only way to teach a lesson to those goons.
Sir, your name is Balidaan but you are making your clients sacrifice.
Now that you have joined me..
..everyone will be sacrificed..
with Prem (love).
Come with us.
Come with us.
- Why are you hitting me?
Come with us.
Come with us.
- Why are you hitting me?
Hit him.
Stop.
Stop.
Don't hit me.
Stop.
Stop.
I am your teacher, Amar Chaudhary.
Teacher?
You are a cheater, you scoundrel.
You give me a zero in the exams.
You gave the wrong answer.
What was the question?
Who is the president of India?
- Mrs. Prathiba Patil.
You had said that it was Abdul Kallam.
The president got changed.
It is my fault that the president got changed?
What do I have to do with when and where Alexander fought Porus?
Do I have to go there and dig their graves?
Hit him.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Well done.
You are doing well, Amar Chaudhary.
Saw that?
That's why I named him after me.
Amar Chaudhary.
Hey, Amar Chaudhary!
You stinky insect of a dirty sewer?
Mother, you go inside.
- Stop barking, you dog.
And let him go.
Otherwise I'll poison your food and feed you.
Got it?
Hey, go.
Take him back with dignity.
Go.
Yes.
- Go.
Let's go, sir.
Grandpa, you are being abused under his pretext.
No, no.
It's not so.
You are like a father to my daughter-in-law.
You are God.
A born leech.
- What?
He is.
This Amar Chaudhary.
It's time for school.
Don't you have to go?
Father, should I get something for you?
Yes, daughter-in-law.
Get some tea for me.
Okay.
- Without sugar.
And without poison.
Have some sweets, Mr. Chaudhary.
I got the land for your liquor factory cleared.
And it hardly cost you anything.
Only 50 lakhs.
Balli.
- Yes.
Don't you know you cannot bring strangers in here?
Who is he?
- He's my nephew.
Nephew?
- Yes, look.
We look similar, don't we?
You mean when I am of your age I will look like you?
Forget about the face, Mr. Chaudhary.
Talk about brains.
He is from America.
He will show your income so less..
..that you won't need to pay tax.
- Really?
You know the billionaire in America?
K.K. Modi.
He used to handle his account.
K. K. Modi?
- K. K. Modi?
Forget it.
Forget K. K. Modi.
Now that you are here you work for Mr. Chaudhary.
Handle his account.
Hire you nephew.
- Nephew!
Grandpa, it sounds like your business.
Ganja.
Balli.
- Yes?
You didn't teach your nephew how to salute?
Salute me.
What to get thrashed?
What did you say?
- No.
I saw my horoscope in the morning.
Yes.
- In it it's written that if I salute..
..anyone younger than me today..
..then he will get thrashed all day long.
But still if you want..
- No, no.
Let it be.
But I have read his horoscope.
Balli.
Come on.
- Let it be, today.
My nephew is with me.
So..
Balli.
Yes.
Now my hands feel warmer.
The apple of my eye.
My brave boy.
- Wild hippo, Amar Chaudhary.
Write 'Welcome' on your face.
You will look like a rotten doormat.
Anyway, your ponytail looks like a dead dog's tail.
Look at your grandpa.
It suits him so well.
Take this.
Stupid.
Go to school.
Yes, grandpa.
This is the first time mother has said the right thing.
The girls in my class tease me.
They said it looks like theirs.
With your permission can I chop it off?
.
Amar Chaudhary, you can have your neck cut but not your ponytail.
This is a warning, not advice.
We are samurais.
This is the identity of our family.
Your I.D. proof.
It is a voter's card, pan card.
Your blood group.
A proof that you are his grandson and he is your grandpa.
Where did this boring old man come from?
Great grandpa.
I saw you.
Today my day will go well.
Concentrate on your studies.
Kids of your age have gone places.
People of your age as well..
..have gone places.
"Happy days are over."
"Now I'm surrounded with sadness."
What is this, Mr. Lehri?
What are you doing?
I'm having black coffee with Obama in the White House.
Can't you see?
I hit the brakes to give you a lift.
Now my shirt has turned into a mop.
All this happened because of me, right?
I'm feeling very guilty.
I love you too.
Now it is my duty to get you out of here.
I also want to leave.
Because if my children grow up they won't recognize me.
And my wife is so nave that the poor thing..
..might once again run away with someone.
No such thing will happen because I have a mind-blowing idea.
This is the boy with whom Sanjana ran away, sir.
He doesn't look like he is from our city.
I'll find him even if he is hiding underground.
Are you telling the truth?
Sir, if I am lying he should die immediately.
No, I take his oath and say that henceforth..
..that that boy was not him but someone else.
Sir.
- What happened?
Sir, someone has come to meet you.
Balli, you got the land cleared for Amar for his liquor factory?
I just got the land cleared for him.
But for you along with the land I also got..
..the license for the liquor factory cleared.
Lehri, go.
You are free to go.
Mr. Chaudhary, I am leaving but before leaving..
..I would like to give you a warning.
Sir, this boy is very smart.
Only I know how he traps people.
You won't be able to anything to him..
..even if he comes and stands before you.
You do one thing.
You keep cleaning cars here till Sanjana's marriage.
Sir, what are you saying?
Sir, this is a crime.
It's a sin.
Mr. Chaudhary, you cannot do this.
Mr. Chaudhary can do anything.
He is Justice Chaudhary.
He provides justice to good people.
And he clears out the bad people.
Pick him and throw him out.
Balli, who is this boy?
He is a con.
C-O-N.
Con.
He joined hands with that girl and fooled me.
Which animal have I left out?
- You dog, clean the car.
Mr. Chaudhary, isn't the boy useful?
Once I start working, there will be no income and no tax.
No income tax.
But Balli, how is this possible?
This boy will work for Amar as well as us.
He has a habit..
..of doing two things together.
You know K.K. Modi in America?
He used to also handle his younger brother S.K. Modi's account.
But what if he turns out to be bad?
Then you can behead my uncle.
Behead me?
- Saw?
He agrees to it.
The thumb impression on the file.
Take it.
Just a minute.
Uncle, I was casually checking your accounts.
There are a lot of discrepancies.
What?
- There must be a slight difference.
21.
- 21..
Balli.
There is a difference of Rs.21.
Rs.21, dear?
It's hardly a difference.
Just a minute, uncle.
You are his assistant, right?
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on, show me the accounts.
Uncle, I'll go and check the accounts properly.
Yes, yes.
Okay, dear.
Hey..
Persuade her.
- Consider it done.
Balli, you saw how my niece's education is benefiting me?
Prem, this is not the right situation to take advantage.
Really?
Then promise me that you will meet me tonight.
And you will let me take all the advantages.
- Prem.
You..
You okay?
- Yes.
I was justjoking.
Balli, why do you look as if you've seen a ghost?
Our future daughter-in-law is checking everything, right?
Yes.
In detail.
Come with me.
Come with me.
Let them work.
Saw that?
My future wife is no ordinary girl.
Yes, I just came to know.
She has taken after me deceased sister.
So, your sister was also like her?
Then the entire family..
What happened?
He is getting scared.
- He fears he might get caught.
Sanjana..
Sanjana is not my daughter.
She is more than a daughter to me, Prem.
Her happiness means everything to me.
But..
But you don't know her uncles.
They..
- I know.
They are rogues from the Neanderthal times.
Orthodox.
I am a modern age dog.
Latest.
When we will fight, I will eat them up.
"I am a dog and she is my partner."
"I tell the truth, when she came.."
"..there came a season to eat everyone up."
Stop it.
Look, aunt, everything will be fine.
I promise.
What were you doing inside?
All that cuddling and all?
Uncle, she fell over me.
Girls from affluent families..
Hello.
Girls from affluent families are like that.
Try to understand.
Whether she falls on you or you fall on her..
..our necks will get cut and fall down.
Uncle, you only asked me to persuade her.
I got persuaded.
You would've got exposed..
..if she would've opened the accounts.
This is the first time I have let a girl touch me and you..
No, no.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
You are my disciple.
Come on, get in.
Get in.
Let's go.
Let's go.
"In 12 months I'll express my love to you in 12 different ways."
"Now I think I won't be able to survive.."
"..even for 12 minutes without you."
"When the winter season starts in January."
"We will switch on the heater of love."
"In a blanket as small as February.."
"..we will play hide and seek."
"March will be a romantic month."
"We'll do something we have never done before."
"What if we aren't able to meet in April?"
"What will happen?
Find a solution."
"I'll get an internet connection so that I can chat with you."
"When the summer season starts in May.."
"..we will party at the poolside."
"We will take a long vacation in June."
"We will go to a hill station."
"When starts raining in July.."
"..
I'll yearn to embrace you."
"We will have a lot of fun in August."
"We will make some arrangements."
"I'll take you to London.
I'll give you a tour of Paris."
"I'll take you on a world tour."
"I feel that I'll be coming often to your house in September."
"We'll see the sunsets together in October."
"You can keep your head on my shoulders."
"By the time the wretch November comes.."
"..you would've already surrendered your heart."
"Things will get confirmed on 12th December."
"With the confirmation from our hearts."
"There will be no car or mare."
"I'll bring the wedding procession on foot."
"In 12 months I'll express my love to you in 12 different ways."
"Now I think I won't be able to survive.."
"..even for 12 minutes without you."
Prem hasn't come as yet, dear.
Don't worry, aunt.
He will surely come.
Why don't you go and pay your respects..
..as you have come to the temple, Junior Chaudhary?
Tell me.
I prayed for a week before my exams.
He failed me.
- Then why have you come here?
I'm my grandpa's junior spy.
Whenever any female in the family goes out of the house..
..I keep an eye on them.
Whether they are going and meeting our enemies.
Aunt.
Go.
My child.
Bless you.
- That's enough.
Bless you.
Sister.
Someone stop them.
You are crying?
They are bound to cry.
These sisters-in-law love each other more than their own sister.
In spite of living in the same city we have met after ages.
Our men our fighting and we women are suffering.
I wonder when this will end.
Like I have united the aunts I will unite the uncles as well.
If I don't turn this family into a 'Hum Aapke Hain Kyon' family..
..then don't call me Prem.
Thank you.
Okay, so you are befriending our enemies..
..in the pretext of praying and worshiping?
Son, she isn't an enemy.
She is your grandaunt.
Amar, my child.
- Don't touch me, you old woman.
Scoundrel, if you say a word more..
..I'll feed you kerosene and light a match in front of your mouth.
Get out of here.
Forgive him, sister.
His grandfather has made him just like him.
I wonder when he will mend his ways.
Why are you laughing?
He will change, but I'm laughing..
..thinking of the way in which he will change.
Junior Chaudhary, the park is closed.
It's closed for others, not me.
Go and tell the manager, Amar Chaudhary is here.
The park will remain open.
Okay, sir.
- Okay, sir.
Come here, you animal.
Salute me.
The park should be closed now.
We have to go home.
You are refusing Amar Chaudhary?
Come here.
How dare you!
I won't spare you.
Go.
Who..
Who are you?
Badman.
Badman?
- Yes.
I'm here to turn a bad boy like you into a good boy.
You..
One kick and from Badman you will become a dead man.
Kick me.
Kick me.
Kick me.
Really?
Here you go.
Darn him.
I am sorry, bad-man.
Spare me.
Forgive me.
Okay.
From today, you'll be a good boy.
Yes, I will.
You won't bunk school.
- Okay.
You won't trouble your teachers.
You'll always respect your elders.
And you will cut your ponytail as well.
- Yes.
No, no.
This is not possible.
It is the identity of my family.
Shut up.
The kid has tired me.
First try to talk things out.
If they don't understand then kick them.
Great, Balli.
Great.
Your nephew is one in a million.
Amar Chaudhary.
Why do you have bandana on your head?
It's the latest fashion, grandpa.
Okay.
Okay.
Fashion.
Come here, my tiger.
And hit on this jackal's head.
Bless me, uncle Balli.
What are you doing?
Respecting my elders, grandfather.
This is what Badman has taught us.
Who Badman?
- He is our new teacher, grandpa.
Teacher?
Grandpa, his new teacher is Prem.
Dear, now I feel he'll also bring my two scoundrels back on track.
Hello
Uncle, uncle Suraj is once again trying to get me married to Veer.
What?
- Yes.
But I want to marry your son, Yuvraj.
Yuvraj?
- Please, uncle.
Please, do something.
Please, quickly get me out of here.
Someone is coming.
Come on, get the cars out.
Load your guns.
Let there be bloodshed?
We will have to bring Sanjana at any cost by this evening.
What are you doing, Chaudhary..
Sir.
Uncle, tell them.
What you are doing is wrong.
You are going to kill your brother for 200 crores?
Whereas someone worth 500 crores is in uncle's pocket.
Who are you talking about?
Uncle, I'm talking about K.K Modi.
Yes.
K.K. Modi from America.
Tell them how much he is worth.
He is worth 5000-7000 crores.
And hear this.
You know who has been given..
..the responsibility of getting his daughter Naina married?
Uncle.
Uncle, you couldn't see this gem of a person?
Whereas Naina desires a gem of a person.
They are such lovely people.
They are romantic.
They are going to kill their brothers.
Uncle, if I wouldn't have thought of this..
..then there would've been a bloodshed today.
Why don't you think?
No, the idea was on the way in my mind..
..but because of traffic..
Get this straight, Balli.
If we don't get this alliance then consider yourself death.
Get out of here.
I took K.K. Modi's name just like that.
You added his daughter to the story.
You added the responsibility of her marriage.
You added all the spices.
Sir, you told me all this..
after having a few drinks.
I told you about people who don't exist?
They exist, sir.
Listen.
- Yes?
Some K.K. Modi has called five times since morning.
He told me to remind you that he is coming..
..to India on Friday to discuss his daughter's wedding.
And yes, he has asked to book some resort.
Don't forget.
How is this possible?
Sir, this means you either have MP or UP.
Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh?
MP means memory power.
- Okay.
Sir, in this illness the battery of memory conks off.
Or UP that is unbelievable power.
Unbelievable power.
- Yes, sir.
In this the characters you think about come in real life.
I don't believe this.
That's why it is called unbelievable power.
Now you have to decide whether..
..it's your effective thinking or defective disease.
Meanwhile, sir, you have thrown me out of the house.
Bye.
Taxi!
- No, Prem.
I said that as I was worried.
Please.
Okay.
- Don't leave me in such confusion.
Okay, sir.
Tell me what I should do next.
There is no option or resort to this.
Yes, the last resort is that you book a resort.
Okay.
They have come?
Limo.
Ballu.
Ballu.
Uncle, go and welcome Modi.
What a pleasant surprise.
Come here.
Come here.
Give your friend a hug.
You have become fit.
I think it is the result of sister-in-law Shakuntala's that.
Love.
- Her love.
How is sister-in-law Sakku?
I hope you didn't have any that on the way.
What is it..
No, no.
One has to take some that for one's child.
Some..
Trouble.
- Yes, trouble.
Let's go.
Mr. Modi.
- Mr. Modi.
Stop.
Is this a way to ask for donations?
Mr. Modi, he is Mr. Chaudhary.
Avery famous L in the city.
- Landlord?
- Landlord.
- Landlord.
Mr. Modi, welcome, welcome, welcome.
Welcome.
Uncle Modi.
Aunt Modi.
Balli works for us.
Okay, Balli knows you.
That means he is our that..
Guest.
- Guest.
Guest.
Call him tonight for..
- Drinks?
Dinner.
Dinner.
And that as well.
Let's go.
Why are you staring at them with your mouth open?
Have you seen them for the first time?
Anyone will give that reaction on seeing Mr. Modi.
Sir, if you are a mouse then he is a cat.
If you are a cat, he is a dog.
If you are a dog, he is a fox.
If you are a fox then he is a lion.
If you are lion then he is an elephant.
If you are an elephant then he is a dinosaur.
Dinosaur of business, sir.
For your own good, come on time for dinner.
Otherwise you are a donkey, sir.
Who is going anywhere?
I am here till night.
Yes.
- Yes.
Let's go.
What happened, uncle?
He met me with so much affection.
He gave me a hug as well.
But I couldn't recognize him.
Is it an illness or my imagination?
Both.
- Both?
One personality is ill.
It is the imagination of the other personality.
The first and the second personality clashed..
..with each other and resulted in the third personality.
Spilt personality.
The fourth personality will be suicidal personality.
You will feel like committing suicide, uncle.
You are right.
- No.
I feel like committing suicide.
- No.
Yes.
- Don't do it, uncle.
- Why?
You won't remember that you have committed suicide, uncle.
So what should I do?
Uncle, now you have only one option left.
What?
- Believe that your personality with imagination is right.
You know him.
He is K.K. Modi.
- You recognize him.
I'll have to.
Otherwise, I'll commit suicide..
..and I won't even remember it.
So what's the use?
He is K.K. Modi.
Mr. Modi, we are not as rich as you are.
But we are well respected in the city.
Great.
- Yes, sir.
They are decent people.
Really?
- They have a lot of cars and are cultured as well.
So brother, tell us, how much loan do you want?
No, sister-in-law, I am..
Balli, tell them.
- What should I say?
Uncle, with your permission can I tell them?
- Yes, please.
Mr. Modi, he is his brother-in-law.
Yuvraj.
He has studied till the 8th grade.
The 8th grade.
Raise two more fingers.
Yes, the 8th grade.
He has studied till the 8th grade.
So?
He wants to marry your daughter.
- What?
Brother Ballu, you have brought such an alliance?
Have you seen their faces?
They look as if they have just come out of a jungle.
Right.
Will their daughter marry into this illiterate family?
The Modis.
They don't have any sense of that.
Fashion.
Nor do they know how to that.
- Talk.
To talk.
They look like that.
That..
Ape-men.
- Ape-men.
If you weren't my friend I would have done that.
Shot.
- Shot you.
Let's go..
- Sumitra.
- Sumitra.
Let's go.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- Okay.
You ruined their mood.
- Shut up.
Shut up.
You..
I'll blow your head with you, you scoundrel.
You fool, he isn't a scoundrel, you are.
Do you know who are you messing with?
You can only make scrabbled-eggs from an egg.
Mr. Modi can turn scrabbled-eggs back to an egg.
You have spoilt the whole game.
But it's okay.
Uncle is here.
He will think of something.
What will I think of?
.
I am totally confused.
Will you tell us what this is all about?
Why have you made us all wear sunglasses?
Excuse me for my language, grandpa.
But what do these Modis think of themselves?
They have kept three conditions for the wedding.
I told them that I won't be able to look into your eyes..
..after telling you those conditions.
And you won't be able to look at each other after hearing them.
He said, "Here, make them wear these sunglasses.."
"..and tell them the conditions."
Tell us.
Tell us, what their conditions are.
Basically the Modis have made..
..the tent of Chaudhary's lives stand on three sticks.
Condition No. 1.
They don't like the way you dress.
What are you doing?
They say that you look like a C-Grade movie's villain.
How dare they!
This..
This is what uncle said.
How dare they!
- Yes.
Yes.
The Chaudharys will never change..
..their dressing sense for their 500 crores.
- Yes.
500..
- Crores.
Okay.
Okay.
We will wear up-to-date suits.
Yes.
- Yes.
Yes.
What is their second condition?
Their family is a joint family like in the movie 'Hum Aapke Hain Kyon'.
They all live together.
So is our family like in the movie 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham'?
We stay separately?
They have never seen you out on a lunch or a picnic..
..with your daughters and daughters-in-law.
- Enough.
They are womenfolk.
This tradition has been going on since ages.
This is what uncle said as well.
- What?
That the Chaudharys will never change their tradition for 500 crores.
Yes.
- 500 crores.
Fine.
Fine.
Listen.
Listen.
Henceforth, we'll all be together.
Tell me the third condition.
If I tell you the third condition then.. your pants will tear.
Pants?
- I am saying this.
I am saying this.
He had said something else.
Tell me the condition.
You'll have to cut it.
- What?
You'll have to cut your ponytail.
- No.
Even uncle yelled and said no.
- Yes.
Yes.
But what can we do?
They hold the trump card of 500 crores.
500 crores. 500 crores.
Cut them, Amar.
You can always grow them back.
But you don't often get a harvest worth 500 crores.
Great.
Now you are looking that and that.
Bold and beautiful.
- Bold and the beautiful.
So tell us, brother.
What have you decided?
What have I..
What do you say, Ballu?
Should I do that?
Yes?
- Do it.
Now that you have found a diamond..
..better set it in the ring.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Fine, then I'll call my daughter and younger that tomorrow.
Brother.
- Brother.
Okay.
- Do you have relatives or brothers or something like that?
No.
He has an elder brother..
Name?
- Suraj Chaudhary.
In spite of having an elder brother..
..you have come alone to fix the alliance?
Where is he?
How can he come here?
We don't get along.
A house where brothers don't that..
- Get along.
Get long.
Will their daughter go there?
- The Modis.
The Modis.
What he means is that their timings don't match.
He is sometimes out and he is sometimes in.
These two brothers love each other a lot.
Like..
Lord Rama and Laxman.
- Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So call them tonight.
Match the..
Timings.
- Timing.
Yes.
Consider it to be our that..
- Condition.
- Yes.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Don't hit my uncle.
What was the need to say..
- Sister-in-law, please, help.
That I have an elder brother?
I said it because you have one.
You could have said that he is dead.
You are strange.
How could say that?
Till date you haven't been able to kill him.
So uncle, how will you kill him?
But we are dead now.
That old man will never listen to us.
Hey, when God gave uncle a head over his shoulders..
..he didn't give it for decoration.
He will think.
He will think of something.
He will bring your brother by his ears.
Shut up.
Suraj Chaudhary will behead me even if I talk about it.
And if he doesn't come here then I'll behead you.
What?
Hey, let us go in.
Move aside.
Side.
Side.
Side.
- Who are you?
Keep distance.
Horn please.
May the face of the one with ill-intentions in his heart go black!
Seize the whole place.
Take everyone's mobiles.
Disconnect their phone.
Hey, who are you?
In this manner..
This is how we enter.
You have all the right to remain silent..
..as this is a raid.
I pay income tax thirteen times a year.
Yet there is a raid?
Sir, Ms. Sanjana.
Hello, uncle Mathur.
Hello, dear.
How are you?
Sanjana, you know these income-tax guys?
Aunt, they are not from the income-tax department.
They are from the World Bank.
I have heard of Punjab Bank and Allahabad Bank.
What is a World Bank?
The one outside Punjab and Allahabad is called World Bank.
The father of all banks.
And the mother of all banks.
Uncle and aunt of all banks.
But, sir, what are you doing here?
Ms. Sanjana's father had taken a loan of200 crores from our bank.
So?
- So he passed away before he could settle the loan.
So?
- He keeps on saying 'so'.
He will lose his mind when he will hear this.
So, we have seized all his property in America.
We have managed to get back 100 crores.
We still need to recover 100 crores.
But Sanjana doesn't hold any property here.
She came here to get married to me.
Fantastic.
After marriage a wife has equal right over the property.
Hence, according to law, we will recover 100 crores from you.
The bungalow itself must be worth 50-60 crores.
Come, let's go.
Let's go.
Mr. Lover, I knew that you would get this marriage canceled.
But what is this issue of100 crores?
Should I tell you everything today itself?
.
What's the rush?
Where are you going?
You are here.
Polish them.
Balli, what kind of a law is this?
The law is according to the place.
Uncle, including this house and other things..
..you will manage to arrange 100 crores, right?
You, too, wouldn't want my deceased father..
..to owe a loan to anyone, right?
Listen, assistant.
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on, let's check the value of the property.
Okay.
- Again?
No.
Actually I have some work with him.
Not now.
Okay?
Fine.
We will begin once your work is done.
Okay, ma'am.
How much work will you do?
You will get tired.
You..
- Everyone is standing here.
It's written in the scriptures, uncle..
..the more you work the better it is.
This girl will put me on streets to beg.
Now I got it.
Why did he break the alliance with this girl..
..and formed an alliance with K.K. Modi.
He knows that this girl has a loan over her head.
Balli.
- Yes.
Instead of us, you got K.K. Modi's daughter..
..alliance fixed into Amar's family.
If he has ruined it, he will mend it.
How?
- How?
You know B.K. Modi.
- Who is B.K. Modi?
You only had said that K.K. Modi has a younger brother.
Yes.
Yes.
He does.
He does.
K.K. Modi has a younger brother.
But what about him?
- His money.
What about his money?
You only had said..
- What?
That he is richer..
..than his elder brother when it comes to money.
Yes.
Yes.
I said so.
But what about him?
- His daughter.
Daughter.
- Daughter.
His daughter's..
mother will also be there.
What about his daughter?
You had taken the responsibility of getting her married.
Wow, Balli.
No matter what you say that's a great condition.
Not condition, connection.
- Whatever.
But tell him Mr. Modi's conditions.
Yes, ma'am.
Coming.
I'll go and check the property.
I'll see how much worth it is.
Darling Balli, what conditions do these Modis have?
"Forgot tradition and became ready."
"If they get it right they will make it big."
"Money can make you do anything."
Amar!
- Brother!
Brother!
Where is your party?
Has gone to pickup your party at the airport.
Where did she come from?
Did you call her?
It feels very nice to see the two of you together today, uncle.
Now my problem is also over.
Now both of you decide who I should marry.
Dear, you should forget Veer.
Last night your mother visited me in my dreams.
And she said, "Veer isn't good enough for my Sanjana."
So the confusion is over.
I will get married to Yuvraj.
No, no, no, no, no, dear.
Yuvraj is absolutely useless.
Your mother visited me in my dreams as well.
She started crying.
She said, "Brother, don't ruin my Sanjana's life.
More tears.
What about me?
Will I stay single all my life?
- Not at all, dear.
We, your uncles are there for you.
We will find someone good enough for you.
Nice, capable and decent.
We will have a grand wedding for you.
Why do you worry, dear?
We are there for you.
- Yes.
Okay, uncle.
Whatever you feel is right.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Meet him.
He's my younger brother..
- B.K..
B.K. Modi.
- Yes.
- Modi.
Look who it is.
Ballu.
How are you, Ballu?
Hi, B.K. How are you?
You look fit.
I think sister-in-law's love has played its trick.
How is sister-in-law, Sakku?
She's absolutely fine.
She keeps talking about all of you.
How is B.K?
What is he doing these days?
That's fine.
Mr. Modi, the girls didn't come with you?
To hell with the girls.
- What?
- What?
He means say hello to Naina and Sunaina.
Yes, they are the apple of their mothers' eyes.
Naina.
- Sunaina.
They both are great, aren't they?
Walk straight.
What are you thinking about, uncle?
What are you thinking about?
I couldn't recognize the other Modi as well.
Uncle, this means it's not an illness but an imagination.
You mean the character I think about, comes to life?
Yes.
You have the power.
Otherwise, how is it possible, uncle.
What will we call a person with such imagination?
We cannot call him human.
You mean I am..
God?
Brahma.
The Creator.
The creator of the universe.
Balli.
Balli.
Look..
How they address God.
Idiots.
He has regained consciousness.
Now we will have fun.
Start that.
Mr. Chaudhary, he is out of coma, but he is unable to speak.
How can he not speak?
Son..
Tell me, who was he?
Speak up.
Tell me.
Who was he?
Tell me, son.
Try to speak.
Try.
Uncle, why is he pointing towards you?
Balli.
This means you..
No, sir.
I cannot even put a comma to sentence.
How can I put him into coma?
Mr. Chaudhary, your son is still not out of coma.
His mind is spinning hence he is moving his finger here and there.
Look, now he is pointing towards him.
Mr. Chaudhary, your son's condition is so bad..
..that he might even point his finger towards you.
Oh, my.
The son is pointing towards his father.
Please go out.
The patient is getting hyper.
Doctor, make my son get well soon.
Because the day he will come out of coma..
..someone else will go into coma.
Let's go.
Let's go.
There are so many sorrows in this world.
Your sorrow is so less.
You aren't able to say anything..
..because of your unconscious state.
And he cannot say anything even when he is conscious.
So sad is this and how bad is that.
Continue.
Sir.
No, sir.
Madam..
- Move back.
I don't care.
Please sir.
Sir, please.
- It's not my problem..
..as to with whom Mr. Chaudhary..
..is having his breakfast and his lunch.
Mr. Chaudhary, I've been looking for you all over the city.
And you are having fun over here.
You are having parties.
I'm being pressurized by the bank.
I keep getting phone calls.
Tell me what you want to do.
Mr. Modi, you are here?
What a pleasant surprise.
Hello, sister-in-law.
- Hello, brother.
Sister-in-law, it seems like you have come here on a holiday.
No, brother.
Our daughters are getting that with the brothers-in-law.
They are getting married with the brothers-in-law.
Mr. Suraj.
- Yes.
Your brother-in-law Veer was going to marry your niece, right?
No.
Niece?
Who is his niece?
Here she is.
Sanjana.
She is a very nice girl.
Why do you want to get related to us instead of her?
Actually, what happened was..
- For Sanjana's happiness.
Sanjana doesn't like Veer and that's why..
..Mr. Chaudhary cancelled the wedding.
Great people.
This is very that.
- Good.
- Good.
Avery good thing.
But brother, it's wrong as well.
Look brother, there is a young unmarried girl in their family.
And they are getting their brothers-in-law married.
It is wrong, isn't it?
True.
It is not so.
Mr. Chaudhary is looking for a suitable boy for her.
He will get her married as soon as he finds a suitable boy.
Take your time and find a boy.
We are here for four days.
Look, first Sanjana will get married then our daughters will.
But Mr. Modi..
- No ifs or buts.
Consider this to be our that.
- Condition.
- Our condition.
Yes.
- Another condition?
Don't worry.
All the four Chaudharys are charged.
They will do something in four days.
Great people.
People, everybody join me please.
"Whether you are a crescent or the moonlight."
"No matter what you are.."
"..
I swear on God, you are great."
Clap, everyone.
Great.
Great.
Brother, the Chaudharys might get a heart attack..
..listening to your conditions.
Brother has kept a condition ofSanjana's wedding.
- Yes.
But you'll have to give the idea that our Prem will be her groom.
Yes.
This condition has been kept to give this idea.
Okay.
But they are very dangerous people.
If they find out the truth..
There is one person who is very dangerous.
Lehri.
He is very smart.
But he has already said such a big lie..
..that now if he tells the truth, he will be the first one to die.
'Okay, so this is his family and not the Modi family.'
Mr. Balidaan.
Balidaan.
The poor thing is standing as a statue.
Fine, I will bring it into life.
Brother.
Brother.
Brother.
I have come here to tell you a secret.
Here he is.
Here he is.
You are doing pushups?
No, I'm pushing the ground down.
Keep quiet.
Keep quiet.
Tell me, who am I?
Am I God?
Am I a human being?
Who am I?
You are the first God with has been made by this human being.
What not have you made me?
Now even I have forgotten who I am.
I have become the Aamir Khan in the movie 'Gajani'.
Look here.
Look at this.
You have no idea how difficult it is to write on your back!
Rascal.
You played such a big game with a genius like me..
..who has written such a famous book?
Give me the book, please.
Here you go, genius.
I won't let you win as long as I am alive.
What will I do?
Mr. Balli, Mr. Chaudhary is calling you.
Go.
You have been summoned.
Yes.
Yes, I've put the ball in the hole.
I've learnt to play golf.
This is how we used to play marbles as well.
You are right.
- Greetings, sir.
Come.
Come, Mr. Balidaan.
Come.
You summoned me?
We have known each other since ages.
Why don't we turn this acquaintance into a relationship?
I didn't get you.
Your nephew Prem and our niece Sanjana.
Let's get them married.
- No.
No, this marriage cannot take place.
Why not?
You are a servant.
We are your employer.
You don't like the respect we are giving you?
Hello.
Why cannot this marriage take place, uncle?
We are their loyal servants.
We have to pay them back in someway or the other.
Right, uncle?
- Don't touch me.
You see, the girl has a loan of100 crores over her head.
That too of the World Bank.
Who will pay it back?
You?
We will pay it back.
We are going to get millions from the Modis.
You can keep 100-125 out of it.
Not 125, only 100 crores.
The amount of the loan.
After that even if you sent your daughter..
..without any clothes on, we will accept her.
Great.
Right, uncle?
We accept it, don't we?
- Yes.
Sanjana, my child..
I accept this match, uncle.
Uncle, your teeth will break if you will grind them so hard.
Mr. Chaudhary, there is a problem.
This Lehri keeps saying that Sanjana..
..had eloped with a boy during her wedding.
If someone comes to know about it on my wedding day..
..then my uncle will be defamed.
Can you please take care of this Lehri, sir?
Go and find Lehri.
Get him here.
Yes, Mr. Chaudhary?
Who eloped with Sanjana?
- This..
What is this that you are asking me?
I had shown you the photograph.
A lie.
You are lying.
He had eloped with Sanjana.
You are right.
He had eloped with her.
Forgive me, I had lied.
He is the one I had given a lift to.
Henceforth, this is what you should tell everyone.
Got it?
Are you happy now, Prem?
Yes, Mr. Chaudhary.
Mr. Lehri, you don't know what a big favour..
..you have done to my uncle and the Chaudhary family.
God will surely send you to heaven.
Congratulations, Balli.
You became their that.
What is it?
Yes, their relative.
Mr. Modi, you are the one who gave us this idea.
Otherwise, how could we ever think of this?
Have this.
Why did you unnecessarily take the that.
Trouble.
You go and have your meal.
We'll all have together.
No, we don't know how long we will take.
Why should you stay that because of us?
Hungry.
Go, have your meal.
Okay.
- I love you.
That's great, Mr. Modi.
At your place the women eat before the men do.
At our place, till we do eat, the women will die but..
..not touch the food.
This is wrong.
Look, women live in a very that world.
Small.
It begins from and ends at us.
The house and kids.
She is that in them.
What is it said?
Yes, restricted.
Hence it is our duty to look after them.
We should love them.
We should always keep them that.
We should keep them happy.
Radhika..
What happened?
Nothing.
You have your meal.
Before you?
So what?
If I drink all night along..
..will you stay hungry till the morning?
What is wrong with you, today?
Love.
I love you.
Sorry.
Shalu.
Shalu?
- Yes, Shalani.
Now I will always call you Shalu.
And henceforth, you can eat before me.
Why so?
- Because I love you.
Thank you.
Brother, Prem is nowhere to be seen.
Sanjana is not here either.
They got what they wanted.
The lovebirds must be busy at some corner.
Yes, so what is wrong in that?
They both that to each other.
They love each other.
They are going to get married.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Come, let's go and have some food.
Come on.
Look, Prem and Sanjana are also back.
Come on.
The bride and the groom are also here.
Let me make an announcement.
I have decided that this marriage won't take place.
What?
What?
Once again uncle must have gone into the 100 crore loop..
..after having a little too much to drink.
Balli, what are you saying?
Keep quiet.
Keep quiet.
You are saying Balli and sacrificing me
This marriage won't take place.
If uncle doesn't want this marriage to take place then..
Without uncle, I don't want to marry like an orphan.
Since when did you become an orphan, you liar?
Here he is.
Your father is here in a three-piece suit.
He is here.
Fine.
Fine.
Fine, Ballu.
If you are breaking your that with him.
Then I will form a that with him.
What is it?
Yes, a relationship.
Henceforth, I am your father.
And I am your mother.
I'm your uncle.
I'm your aunt.
If you are falling short of relatives then I, too, shall become one?
Why..
Why would you become anyone?
You are his uncle.
Keep it fixed.
Then it is fixed.
- Yes.
Henceforth, I am his uncle.
- And I am his aunt.
Look at that.
They all are telling the truth.
Chaudharys, can't you see the truth?
Brother.
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't do this.
Don't do this.
No matter how he is, he is my uncle.
My real uncle.
I'll make him understand.
Uncle, you saw how many relatives I have now?
It won't make a difference if I have one uncle less.
Yes, uncle.
On one hand your final rites will be performed..
..and on the other my wedding ceremony.
Correct.
- But this wedding will surely take place.
Yes, so I will prepare for the wedding.
- Yes.

By the way, Prem..
- Yes?
Have you come here to show the necklace..
..your family has bought for her or to see Sanjana?
I had come to congratulate all of you.
This is the first love marriage taking place in your family.
Yes, of course.
Aryan.
You came from the hospital on the right day.
Come, I'll introduce you to Sanjana's future husband.
Don't you want to get ready?
- Ready?
Come on, go.
Go.
- I am ever ready.
Ask Sanjana.
Prem.
Prem, look who is here.
He is the one.
He is the one who hit me with his car.
I went into coma because of him.
He was the one who eloped with Sanjana.
Look, Veer, Yuvraj.
Sanjana and Prem love each other.
That means everyone is a part of Prem's conspiracy.
I'll take care of you later, you wrenched woman.
We will first..
..take care of you.
You are flying too high.
Do you love to fly?
Yes, we do.
- What will you do?
Nothing, boys.
I'll just help you fulfil your dream.
You..
Where shall I keep it?
We will have to tell brother-in-law about his true identity.
Fools, not the true identity, but a false one.
Never underestimate three things in life.
I, me and myself.
Thank you.
No one can deport the one who has the family's support.
I am someone who can drown a fish.
What can you three.. do to me?
Go, Veer.
Go, Yuvraj.
I'll see how he stops you.
Let's go.
You are sleeping even after coming out of coma?
Do you remember your name?
Aryan.
- Aryan, go into flashback.
And see what I had done to you.
Where did he go?
He left right in front of you.
Mr. Modi.
- Yes.
Mr. Modi.
- What happened?
Mr. Modi.
- What happened?
We know the truth about that scoundrel Prem.
He is not Balli's nephew.
So?
- He isn't the real Modi either.
He is my real uncle.
A Kapoor.
Uncle.
- Yes, nephew.
Uncle.
- Uncle, catch them.
We'll see you.
- We'll see you.
Prem, I'll go with you.
- You handle the ladies inside.
I'm a Modi.
I'm a Modi.
I'm a Modi.
Aryan.
Aryan, let's go.
Save us.
Save us.
One.. two.. three.
The keys.
The keys are with me.
Take it.
Come here..
Come here..
That way.
That way.
Side effects of too much rajma chawal (a rice dish).
Sorry.
O God!
Card.
Card.
- Thank you.
Call me.
No pee me.
Pee them.
Hey, stop peeing there.
Stop him.
Stop him.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Stop there.
Let's go fast.
You are a dead man.
We won't spare you.
What's this new drama.
Bye-bye!
Amar.
Sanjana reminds me of our sister Shibani today.
Yes, brother.
Our Sanjana looks so happy.
I'm ready to go to the moon for her.
What?
Uncle, looking at her I feel that I won't even need..
..the almond flavoured milk.
Dad.
You know there is a that.
A custom.
Yes, but till date I've never got that of that custom.
A need.
You, too?
- Yes.
Stop this wedding.
Dear good people, someone stop them.
Aryan, you are back from the hospital.
But who did this to you?
That beguiler, Prem.
We have been cheated in such a big way.
Why did you do this to us?
Why?
Mr. Chaudhary, this was Sanjana's mother's desire.
And there was a belief in her wish.
Her wish was that you two get Sanjana married..
..and give her your blessings.
And she believed that..
..you two brothers will unite because of this marriage.
That means you really made a fool out of us.
You cheated us with 500 crores.
That means he is not a Modi.
And they are your uncles.
Listen, you idiots.
That's what I've been telling you since so long.
But you didn't listen to me.
You didn't listen to me as well.
Then tell them now.
No, you only tell them.
God sent you down here but He forgot to give you any brains.
You didn't change even after seeing the goodness in him?
But I have changed.
From now on I will be a true uncle to Prem.
Let me see who tries to touch my nephew.
Come on.
Coming.
Here you go.
You will touch my nephew.
No, I am here to give you a hand, sir.
- Okay.
Sir, being with them till date I have only washed cars.
Being with you, I am sure I will thrash a person or two.
Great.
Great.
Come on, let's begin the thrashing.
We are the five good men..
..and you are the two evil uncles.
Hippo Amar Chaudhary, you will get crushed in their fight.
Come here.
Fools, what are you waiting for?
Shoot them all.
We have come to attend the wedding.
We support love and not hatred.
Prem has changed us.
By giving double the money.
Let's go, hired goons.
Traitors.
Prem, you continue.
It's inauspicious to stop that in the middle.
That.. that..
- The wedding vows.
The wedding vows.
The wedding vows.
Come on.
Let's go.
Priest, hurry up.
Otherwise, my father and the rest of them will get thrashed.
Come.
Can I hold it?
Shall I start walking?
Come on, son.
Priest, please hurry up.
I'll shut down your World Bank.
Fast.
Fast.
I'm safe.
No.
This will be fine, Choudhary.
This is too much.
Prem, you can get another wife..
..but you won't get another father.
Today, for the first time a woman has said something sensible.
Go, Prem.
Prem, you won't get a better chance to remove your shirt.
Show your body.
- I won't.
Why?
- He has become fat.
Fat.
What shall I say?
Enjoyed it?
Mr. Chaudhary, I am here to form relations..
..and not to break bones.
Anyway, at our place we don't even look into the eyes of senior citizens.
Raising a hand on them is a farfetched thing.
Hence, chill and relax, Mr. Chaudhary.
Chill and relax.
Saw that?
This is what is called good values.
But are miles away from it.
Yes, you only know the meaning of greed..
..selfishness and deception.
You didn't even bother about my mother, you deceased sister.
How low will you stoop for money?
My child is absolutely right.
On one hand this boy is making sacrifices for his future wife.
And on the other it's you guys..
..who since ages have been making your wives sacrifice.
I'm feeling ashamed..
..to call both of you my sons.
Shame on you.
Disgusting.
Hey old man, have you lost your mind.
Father.
Get up, father.
Father..
Don't you dare!
He is our father.
I will cut your hand if you even touch him.
And I will break your jaw if you misbehave with him.
He lied.
He cheated everyone.
And you are..
They aren't even Modis.
What difference does the name make, son?
A person is known for his deeds.
And then, when have we ever acted like Chaudharys?
We have instead demeaned the Chaudhary name.
They are the real Chaudharys.
No, we are very satisfied being Kapoors.
How can he be a Chaudhary?
He has made us fight.
Brother-in-law, we should take revenge from him.
Revenge for what?
We should seek revenge because he made us human?
We should seek revenge because..
..by changing relations he changed us.
We brothers have been enemies since ages.
But today when our father got hurt our hearts felt the pain.
Should we seek revenge for that?
We should learn from this family.
Just being a part of a family doesn't make you a dear one.
A member is a dear one when you accept him.
Sir.
Sorry.
Sir..
We hold our ears and say..
..that we will never act like goons again.
And we will never be greedy for money.
And one more thing, sir.
Mr. Modi, what is your original surname.
Kapoor.
Kapoor.
- Mr. Kapoor, please forgive us.
And accept us.
Let us be a part of this wedding along with our girl, please.
Madam.
Chaudharys plus Kapoors equals to Chapoors.
Mrs. Chapoor.
Oh, my, Mrs. Chapoor.
Someone stop her.
Ready?
Ready!
One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Ready.

Wow!
The steamed potatoes have no steam in them.
And there is no saffron in the saffron sweetmeat.
Really?
What really?
I was just tasting them.
Look, what happened with all the tasting that you've done.
'That's Prem's uncle, Laxman Kapoor.'
'And his wife, Kiran.'
"l love you.
I love you.
I love you."
What is it?
You are dancing with joy.
Why?
- You didn't dance so much at our wedding.
I'm celebrating someone else's joy.
That was a suicide.
- Suicide?
My joy.
Does anyone dancing when he is happy?
Not suicide.
'That's Prem's uncle, Bharat Kapoor.'
'And his wife, Suman.'
Look, brothers, if there is that at that then that will happen.
What that and that will happen?
If there is lack of anything at the wedding..
..then we will get defamed.
- Okay.
Okay.
Don't worry, brother..
- Everything will be fine.
- Sure?
'These three brothers love each other a lot.. ' like Ram, Laxman and Bharat.'
'And co-incidentally their names are..'
Ram, Laxman, Bharat.'
By the way, where is my that?
That?
Liquor bottle?
- No, brother.
Not during the day.
It will ruin the wedding.
- No, it is taller than a bottle.
That..
That..
- The bride.
She is inside.
- Not the bride.
That..
That..
A child.
- How can there be a child when he is not married?
My child.
My child.
- His child.
Prem.
Prem.
Say that.
Where is that idiot?
- No, brother.
Don't call him an idiot.
This wedding is taking place because of him.
- Yes.
Khushi would have never agreed..
.. if he wouldn't have reasoned it out with her.
- Right.
'Khaman Dhokla'.
- 'Khaman Dhokla'..
- Brother..
Gaurav had gone inside to meet Khushi for two minutes.
Half an hour has passed by.
Go and check what's happening.
The auspicious hour is passing by.
- Really?
'It is their friend and neighbour Mr. Pathak's daughter's wedding..' whose name co-incidentally is Khushi.'
Khushi.
Khushi, my child.
Where are you?
Son-in-law.
Son-in-law.. what happened?
Who did all this?
Where is Khushi?
She ran away.
- She ran away?
She ran away with her lover.
- Lover?
Who is her lover?
Your neighbour, the Kapoors..
Their pampered, spoilt, rascal, scoundrel son.

Then sign here.
- Okay.
Thank you.
Take this.
Here you go.
Exchange the garlands.
You are now husband and wife.
Click a photograph.
Just a second.
Click it.
Click it.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I was not in town.
If you wouldn't have helped her run away..
.. her father would have got her married to someone else.
Yes.
And I would have become someone else's wife.
Not a chance.
Here's my card.
You are a registrar here.
We know.
No, no, no.
This is my other card.
I'm also a divorce lawyer.
I've dissolved more marriages than I've performed.
And looking at the two of you I feel..
.. that you will definitely need me in future.
I know love is blind.
But marriage makes everyone see things clearly.
Do you see things clearly?
I'm still blind.
I've already married thrice.
I'm waiting to get married for the fourth time.
What kind of a man is he?
- Thank you.
Let's go.
Let's go.
We don't want your card.
Sir.
Sir, at least take the card.
Sir..
Who is he?
- He was getting married to her.
Look, brother, she was being forcefully to marry you.
And that's why..
- Forget it.
I was being forced to marry her.
What?
-I had come to tell Khushi that I love Kiran.
But I didn't get a chance to talk.
I was hit with a stick on my head and I fell unconscious.
I won't spare you.
- Brother, no..
Stop it, Gaurav.
Stop it.
We should thank them.
- Yes.
We wouldn't be together if he wouldn't have helped Khushi elope.
Say thanks.
Kiran.
- Hi.
How are you?
Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
Hurry up, the two of you.
Come here and get married.
I have to go and get someone divorced.
Let's go.
It's time for our flight as well.
We'll make a move.
Thank you so much.
- See you.
Take care.
Brother Prem.
-What?
Brother Prem, everyone inside..
Pathak shitting petrol.
Shitting?
- Seating sofa.
Oh, seating.
- Yes.
Okay.
You parking bike.
I'm seeing how much shitting.
He is here.
He is here.
He is here.
I'll set myself on fire.
I'll kill myself.
This drama has been going on since last night.
Neither is he sleeping nor is he letting us sleep.
Whenever he dries a little he wets himself again with petrol.
Mr. Pathak, if you wish to set yourself on fire..
.. please do so outside, in the garden.
Why are you burning our house with you?
- Quiet.
Yes, exactly.
You heard that?
You heard that?
After ruining my family he is talking about his house.
Daddy, why don't you dive and snatch it?
Shut up.
You have done that.
- A wrong thing.
A wrong thing.
Yes.
- Stay away.
Stay away.
Stay away.
I'll set myself on fire.
Brother..
- Stay away.
Stay away.
Stay away.
Brother, Khushi is not just your daughter but his friend as well.
Yes.
- Yes.
I'm sure she must have seen something special in Raj...
I'm sure the day you see them happy, you will forgive them.
That day will never come in my life.
And there are hardly any days left in my life.
Perhaps not even one.
Yes.
He is right.
He is right, right?
Then keep this aside.
I'll commit suicide.
- You..
I'll commit suicide.
- Who are you threatening?
I'll help you.
Does anyone have a lighter?
No, I don't have it.
This lighter..
- You started smoking?
- You started smoking?
Shame on you.
- Brother, I didn't..
Don't change the topic.
What were you saying?
I'll help you deep fry.
What are you doing?
Prem?
- What is this?
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Prem?
Prem?
Prem?
- Will Mr. Pathak's death affect anyone of you?
No.
- No.
- Will the world end?
What..
What..
What..
I will burn him down.
Okay.
I won't spare you.
I won't spare you.
- Prem.
Prem.
You'll ruin everything.
- Prem.
Something has to be done about this boy.
Hello, Guru.
Hello.
- Come.
Come, Ram.
Have a seat.
Have a seat.
Look, Ram..
- Yes?
Prem has done a good deed by uniting two lovers.
Guru, he ended brother and Mr. Pathak's age old friendship.
Yes.
- Prem that's the talks of his marriage even before it starts.
What is it called?
- Ends.
- He ends it.
Last month Guru sent a dog to your place, right?
Yes.
She is very nice.
- Yes.
She keeps everyone happy.
- Yes.
He sent two maids for household chores.
Naina and Sunaina.
They are very nice girls.
But cannot get Prem married to them.
- Right.
Right.
Similarly, Guru has found a bride for Prem.
Ram, listen to me.
You know the Malhotras from America..
Yes.
- Their daughter is perfect for Prem.
Yes.
She is a Bandit Queen.
A Bandit Queen?
- A Bandit Queen?
Phoolan.
- Only her behavior.
She is very good at heart.
Her name is Pooja.
- Wonderful!
She is the only girl who can change Prem.
Guru, then why are you doing that in this?
Why are you delaying this?
- Why the delay?
She is coming to Bangkok tomorrow for her friend's wedding.
It will be great if Prem likes her.
Whether Prem likes her or not..
..only Pooja will come to our house as that.
What?
- A bride.
- A bride.
A bride.
- Yes.
Hello.
- Karan, I've been trying all six numbers of yours since so long.
Tell me what happened to the wedding.
Iran away from the wedding.
But my passport is with them.
What?
It'll take at least 10-15 days to make a new passport.
But what will I do in the meanwhile?
They will find me.
I'll call you later.
- Hello!
Hello!
Hi, Pooja.
Do you need a ride?
No, thank you.
Prem and his uncle are coming to fetch me.
Prem, Pooja is coming at Terminal 3..
.. why are we standing at Terminal 7?
That's the game plan.
- Why are you throwing it?
How will Pooja recognize us?
That's what I want.
She shouldn't recognize us.
Why
What are you doing?
What is this..
This.. is a proof for my father that we went to the airport..
.. but Pooja Malhotra didn't come here.
So we came here..
- Uncle, tell me one thing.
Neither you nor I have ever seen her.
Nor has anyone in the family has seen her.
Guru has sent an imported Pooja Malhotra from America..
.. so that she marries me and changes me?
- Correct.
Uncle, I need a very impish, roguish and talented wife.
Impish, roguish and talented?
But nowadays it's so difficult to find..
..an impish, roguish and talented wife.
All of them are married.
I am there.
But what will tell our Guru?
Let the Guru's mother go to hell.
Does he have a sister?
- Yes.
Then we shall send both of them.
- Okay.
Both mother and sister will go to hell.
Prem.
Who called me Prem so hatefully?
What did you think?
I will wait for you at Terminal 3?
And you will click a photograph here..
, and fool father?
- Pooja.
How did you recognize us?
Not you, him.
Daddy had given his description when I was leaving America.
I scanned the entire airport.
He was the only rogue with an innocent face.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
What an image you have, Prem.
I'm proud of you.
Why are you in a wedding dress?
What did you think?
I'll come from America in a two-piece bikini?
It would've been better.
- Just shut up.
Come on!
Let's go.
Excuse me.
Don't take advantage of the situation.
And don't you dare touch me.
Let's go.
Wow.
Impish, roguish and talented.
I should have asked for something else, uncle.
What better could have you asked for?
Think about it.
A young and old imp at home.
And they will bet on who is more impish.
Your aunt and she will get along well.
Truly.
I'll bet on your girl.
They are here.
Pooja is here.
Pooja is here.
Brother, is she Pooja?
Or has he brought some other girl from her wedding?
You all must be surprised, right?
Seeing me dressed as a bride.
You see, a girl looks her best in a wedding dress.
So, I told myself, "Pooja, don't take a chance."
"If you want to impress everyone.."
then go dressed as a bride.
- Very impressed."
Impish.
Okay, tell me, how did you like our Prem?
Yes.
How did you like you?
I liked all of you a lot.
Very talented.
And if all of you support me then..
.. we will change him for good as well.
Talented also.
- Okay.
Then all of us are with you.
Come in.
Come in.
Come in.
- Come in, dear.
She will change him for good.
She didn't bring any bags with her.
What was the need to bring any luggage?
I'm not staying in a hotel.
I'm staying with my in-laws.
There is anything lacking in here?
Yes, only that like you was lacking.
That..
What?
- What do you call a son's that?
Daughter-in-law.
- We were only lacking a daughter-in-law..
..and now your presence has changed that as well.
Your father has become that.
- Mad?
Should I tell your father?
You are saying such things about my elder brother?
Yes?
Tell us, when are you going for the wedding?
I just ran from a wedding.
You ran away from it?
But you were going to Phuket for your friend's wedding, right?
Yes, I was going to.
What do you mean, "I was going to?"
If you didn't go there then how did you ran away from it?
By ran away I mean I got rid of it with great difficulty.
Why would I unnecessarily waste my time in Phuket?
That's right.
Why waste time in Phuket?
If I would attend my friend's wedding..
..then how would I make arrangements for my wedding?
And I have to fulfil the responsibility Guru has given me.
She will marry you.
She is wishful-serpent.
I will never let her wish come true.
Sir, Pooja's on the line.
Pooja?
- Pooja?
It's for Pooja.
Give it to me.
Hello.
Hi.
How are you?
I'm standing at the airport since the last two hours..
..and you are asking how are you?
I'm not okay, understand?
My friend.
The one who is getting married.
She is very angry.
Anyway, look, I am waiting at the airport, come on.
And he didn't come to pick me up.
- Didn't get the time.
I have come here from America and he didn't get the time?
If you don't believe me then talk to Prem's dad.
I?
- Dad, she is calling all of you.
Tell her that you all are not free.
- Yes.
Look, we cannot come.
We don't have that.
Tell her that we don't have a car.
- No, we have a car.
The thing that moves like this.
Pendulum.
- We don't have a pendulum.
Excuse me?
- Time.
No, we don't have time.
Sorry.
Heard that?
Now do you believe me?
If you don't have time then even I am not stupid..
..to waste my time for you over here.
I'm going to attend my friend's wedding.
And I'll go to Guru's ashram after 8-10 days.
If you finally have the time and you wish to meet me..
..then you can come there.
Understand?
Okay.
That's a great idea.
Bye.
Come, Pooja, I'll take you to the guestroom.
Aunt, am I a guest that I'll stay in the guest room?
I'll stay in Prem's room.
In Prem's room?
- Before this?
Before marriage?
Until we get married, Prem will stay in the guestroom.
Yes.
Don't worry about him.
He can also sleep on a table.
Look, he is sleeping.
Ma'am, if you want to stay then stay in the guestroom..
.. otherwise, I'll make you disappear in such a way..
Prem.
- Daddy, my room..
Uncle, cool down.
Now I am here.
I'll handle it.
Now look here, my future husband.
For now, I have just snatched your room.
After that I'll snatch your sleep and peace of mind as well.
I'll make you empty.
Empty.
You..
- No abusing.
Come, aunt.
Show me my room.
Go.
Go.
Show it to her.
- I'll be right back.
Brother, she will set him straight.
Isn't she very delicate?
- She is a lizard.
A lizard.
I don't know where that girl is.
I'm telling the truth.
You lost her.
My men couldn't find her.
Where did she go?
She doesn't know anyone in the city.
And no one knows her.
Where can she go?
Where can she go?
Where?
Where?
Hit him.
I want her at any cost before Suraj Chaudhary to her.
Someone stop me.
She is one piece from head to toe.
How do I cut her into pieces?
Prem, control your mind.
I'll control my mind but..
This girl with a face that looks a mix of banana and mango..
If you scream this Rampuri dagger will take to straight to Lord Rama.
You are taking advantage of the situation.
Situation?
Advantage?
Again?
She will yak and force someone..
.. to think about it even if he isn't in the mood.
But what will you gain by killing me?
The CEO of fools, I won't benefit from it, you will.
I'll double your value.
- What?
How much is a live chicken worth?
- Rs.100.
And how much is a Tandoori chicken worth?
- 200.
So doesn't that double the value after death?
You will snatch my peace of mind?
You will snatch my room?
If you don't leave by tomorrow morning..
.. then I swear by Baba Rampuri..
.. I will kill you.
What happened?
- What happened, dear?
What happened?
- What happened?
What happened?
She must have had a nightmare.
She must have screamed.
A lot can happen in a nightmare.
Like..
Yes, a sneeze.
I was dreaming?
- Look, she is agreeing.
Come on, go back to sleep.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- She was dreaming.
Let us know if you need anything.
- Let's go.
Okay, goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Never underestimate three things in life.
Shucks..
Me, me and me.
Now you only bloody decide whether..
..you have to come to this house in a palanquin..
..or you want to leave this house.. as a dead person.
"Oh, Lord of the whole universe."
"Mighty Lord of the whole universe."
"All Thy devotees' agonies.. "
"All Thy devotees' sorrows.. "
"Instantly Thou banish."
"Oh, Lord of the whole universe."
Great.
I feel I am going to have a great day in office.
After all my day began with such a nice prayer.
You have been named aptly.
We are feeling as if we are in Haridwar.
- Yes.
We have got such a nice daughter-in-law.
Dear, you are so cultured and you have such good values..
..in spite of living in America.
Bush taught Obama and Obama taught her.
So who is her mother is in America?
Obama?
Listen..
To celebrate Pooja arrival we will distribute that in the office.
That..
- Tennis ball?
No, not that.
- Paperweight.
'Laddoo' (Indian sweet).
Right, brother?
Yes. 'Laddoos'.
We will distribute 'Ladoo'.
We will distribute 'Laddoos'.
Yes, they are round as well.
The world is also round.
Should we distribute that?
- No, no, no.
What kind of people there are in the world, uncle.
Of different types.
They neither pray in the morning nor go to work.
Yes.
- True, dear.
There are such people as well.
What times have come!
There's a demon staying in a God's house.
I'll have to use my demonic mind.
Uncle.
- What happened?
What happened?
What happened?
- Nothing.
It's a small injury.
Should I seek revenge?
Here you go.
Mother Earth.
Bad mummy.
Bad mummy, Mother Earth.
- Sorry, uncle.
He was trying to make me fall but you fell instead.
But why was he trying to make you fall?
Anger.
I said a few true things and he got angry.
He got irritated.
Why get irritated with it?
She is telling the truth.
He is always either on his bike or his skates.
Otherwise he keeps building his body in the spare time.
Why are you ruining my healthy body?
Everyone is saying something or the other..
.. don't you have to say something?
God sent him here to increase the burden on earth.
You are telling the truth for the first time.
We have been given a life..
..only so that he can disgrace us.
Absolutely right.
- He is a big disgrace.
You have a great sense of honour, uncle.
Even a Satan will look like a God in front of him.
Great.
- Wonderful.
He is..
- I think I'll have to tell aunt about your affair, uncle.
I'm not saying it from my heart.
Don't take it to your heart.
My hand broke.
- Be careful.
Be careful.
Be careful.
Take me to a hospital.
- We'll have to do something about her.
She's digging a grave for you.
What happened?
- I cannot move it.
I'll handle her.
Because uncle, once she is gone, life is fun.
Great, Pooja.
Great.
- Enough.
It is delicious.
- Fantastic.
- She cooks so well.
- Yes.
Outstanding.
Outstanding.
Yes.
- And she sings so well.
- Yes.
And she is also changing our spoilt brat for good.
- Yes.
Look, he is here.
Son, your name is Prem (love) and not 'Hatred'.
Right?
- Really?
Hey, listen.
Hello.
- Sit.
Madam, go.
Go to the airport.
Come on.
Why?
- Your father has sent a parcel for you.
From USA.
- Yes, so why are you giving me the news?
You should have collected it for me.
He is useless.
You sing so well.
You cook so well.
What would have happened if you had studied a little as well?
The officer there won't give the parcel to me without your signature.
You only will have to go there.
How will the poor girl go to airport alone?
You go with her, Prem.
Am I her driver, chauffeur or servant?
Brother.
- Prem, you go with her.
Daddy, you are very that.
- I am very boring.
But still, you will go.
Go, dear.
Go.
Yes, but dad didn't inform me over the phone.
Oh, fax.
- What?
He has sent a fax, you dirty mind.
Why are you wasting time talking, Prem?
The parcel will go back.
Come on, leave.
Go.
Please go, son.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Be careful.
I think he's up to something.
I have a mobile.
I'll call if anything happens.
Only if he will let you call.
'I could've easily spent 10-12 days in this house..'
'..if he wouldn't have been born here.'
'She has made my family crazy about her in two days]
'I would be dead if she would stay for 12 days."
'He cannot stop taking advantage.'
'We take advantage of those we would gain something from.'
'I am just trying to get rid of her.'
'Airport is on the left and he is taking a right turn."
'Is he planning to take me to the jungle and..'
'No, madam.
If I do any such thing..'
'..then I'll get stuck with you forever.'
'Then I will have to marry you.'
'Then why is he taking me to a jungle?
'
'Will he leave me amidst wild animals?
'
'I would have if I wasn't so concerned about the poor animals]
'I think I'll have to show her a few lions.'
How can you even think of such a thing?
What are you doing?
Where are the keys?
- I threw it.
The steering wheel got locked.
Why did you throw it?
Are you a woman or what?
I'm a woman.
- If you are a woman..
..then you should have kept the keys here, like a woman.
Keys are not kept there.
Keys are kept around the waist.
To hell with your 26" waist.
I can see a six and a half foot grave there.
Move the steering wheel.
No, steering wheel has failed.
The steering wheel has failed.
Your mind has failed.
But the brakes didn't fail, right?
- No, they didn't.
Prem.
- She's gone.
- Prem.
Prem.
Prem.
Prem.
Where are you?
- I am here.
Down here.
She was hanging me, now God has hanged her.
Are you dead or alive?
I'm still alive, but I can die anytime.
Help me.
- Okay.
Take this.
Take my hand.
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come closer first.
No, I am thinking that it's better..
..if one person dies rather than two.
Coward.
Dastard.
Pansy.
Chicken.
Should I come there to help you so that you can help me?
Let me ask help for myself first.
Hurry up.
- Help me, God.
Give me your leg.
- You are already hanging.
How else should I hang you?
I mean give me your leg.
Leg?
Man and woman look good in pair.
But to touch something with ones' leg is a grave sin.
You are hanging on the branch with both your hands.
How will you save me?
Ma'am, each hand of mine has 2 times a gorilla's strength.
Depending on age and size.
By the way, I can save you with one hand.
Then Useless, use that hand.
Hold my waist and pull me.
No, no, no.
Not the waist.
Then you will say that I took advantage.
What?
- By the way your waist is..
Let my waist go to hell.
Hold whatever you want.
Do whatever you want.
But please save me.
In that case, come to me, my suitcase.
Look madam, you are taking advantage of my disadvantage.
- What?
If you come any closer, then I swear..
..I'll let go of both the hands and embrace you.
And both of us will be dead.
Please save me.
Let's go.
What are you doing?
Just hanging around.
Don't worry.
You women are amazing.
You cannot stick on to anything other than your age.
Sometimes you say take the advantage..
..sometimes you say don't take advantage.
What nonsense is this?
All your yakking is making me go crazy.
It was the demand of the situation.
I wasn't wrong to touch you now.
I was wrong to touch you earlier.
If this is not wrong then why is that wrong?
And if that is wrong then why isn't this wrong?
Actually, you are wrong.
It is wrong to sit here and talk to you.
It's of no use.
I'll lie down.
Obviously it's of no use.
I'm sitting and you are lying down.
It would've benefited if either ..
..both of us were sitting or lying down.
Look, don't say double meaning things to me.
This is a limit to illiteracy.
Where is a double meaning in it?
Look, don't turn and sleep like this.
I feel something inside.
By the way, the jean fits well..
..on your waist.
My ill-fate I wish he wasn't a man.
And you weren't a woman.
Sanjana Singh.
Pooja has horns.
Prem!
'Prem.
Prem.
Prem.'
Isn't it a great place?
You call out once and it echoes back a number of times.
You have brought me here to hear this?
Oh, no.
This is nothing.
Now I'll shout your name and see what name echoes back.
Should I?
Sanjana!
'Sanjana.
Sanjana.
Sanjana.'
Heal' if.
'Sanjana.
Sanjana.
Sanjana.'
I'm saying Pooja and it is echoing back as Sanjana.
Isn't it a strange place?
Look, the valley is so deep.
Prem.
- Only echoes come back from here, not people.
Tell me the truth.
Who are you?
Otherwise, I'll let go of you.
I'll tell you the truth.
Pull be back first.
Come on, start your story.
You already know my real name.
Sanjana Singh.
Actually, I had come from America to get married.
But the guy I was going to get married to..
..turned out to be a famous don's son.
Iran away from the wedding but they snatched my passport.
It takes at least 10-12 days to make a new passport.
I needed a place to hide as well.
Then I saw you at the airport.
You had come to pick up Pooja and no one knew Pooja.
So I thought..
You know the rest.
-I know the rest.
What did you do with the real Pooja?
I hope you didn't murder her.
No.
She has gone to attend her friend's wedding, in Phuket.
She will go to Guru's ashram from there.
Guru.
Guru.
Guru.
He is a..
Let's go.
Prem.
Hey, move aside.
"My heart broke."
"My heart went crazy."
I think you want me..
..to give you a lift.
You are very handsome and dashing..
..brother.
- Brother?
This car won't go anywhere.
It has broken-down.
Why?
What happened, darling?
Darling?
- The car will run.
It will get repaired.
I'm a mechanic.
It's my job.
Hope in.
Yes.
- But you didn't ask me where you should drop me.
I haven't caught you as yet, to drop you.
First let me introduce myself.
I'm Mr. Lehri.
I'm sure you know Bhappi Lehri.
There is no connection between us.
Yes, there is a connection.
He likes gold and I like to sleep.
Hello.
Why are you whistling?
You've already won over me.
Are you from Pattaya?
Who is he?
Is he your boyfriend?
No, he is a distant friend.
- A distant friend?
Just like a distant relative.
Okay.
Then I have no problem..
..because I am shortsighted.
So shall we leave, Mr. Weak?
Hello.
I keep a person like you as my driver.
Really?
- Yes.
- Then give me the keys.
Come on.
The key is in its place.
I got a driver.
Come on, darling.
Come behind.
Come on.
Come on.
Watch your feet.
You aren't in the mood to come behind?
Not a problem.
We'll talk from here.
Great.
It's such a young and beautiful weather.
When I look at you I remember a romantic phrase.
Tell me.
Mingle in jungle.
I, too, remember a phrase when I see you.
A.K. Hangal in the jungle.
You know liquor and beauty have a deep connection?
I'm often intoxicated and the evening passes away.
There will be a day when the evening will be intoxicated..
..and you will pass away.
Hello.
I'm not here to get insulted.
Where do you usually go to get insulted?
Where will I go?
I stay at home.
I'm married.
You give a lift to a single girl even when you are married?
Who doesn't?
I only give, you take it as well, forcefully.
Watch out!
What is he doing up there?
Plucking fruits.
He plucked a lot of fruits.
Oh no!
- What have you done?
I didn't do it.
You did it.
Hard work paid off, didn't it?
You were driving very passionately.
Whose car is this?
- This is my car.
It's not a car.
It is my wife.
I love it.
If your wife has an affair with someone..
..then who will work hard on her?
Her lover, who else?
Who will enjoy it?
- My wife, who else?
Who will get punished?
- Me, who else?
So just imagine.
She is your wife.
Who was working hard on her?
- You.
Who was enjoying it?
- She was.
Who will get punished?
Me, who else?
Because it was my car.
Don't cry, my son.
Be strong.
The Lord works in mysterious ways, my son.
Have this fruit.
You are a Father?
Father.
Father, I had bad thoughts about her.
Father, I'm a sinner.
I've committed a grave sin, Father.
I am a sinner.
Hey!
Stop the car.
There's the girl.
What have I done!
- Prem, let's go.
They are his men.
Come.
- Come on.
Come on.
Fast.
Or she'll escape.
- I want to confess.
Where is that girl?
- Which girl?
The one who was standing here with you.
Your sister.
She..
Sister?
I think she ran away with brother-in-law.
Listen, have you seen our boss?
Who is your boss?
- Tall, board, huge man.
Okay, this..
What are you asking?
I'm selling these fruits here.
The fruits of hard work.
These fruits are very tasty.
Just taste them.
No.
I didn't.
My car hit him.
Get him.
- My car hit him.
Mr. Chaudhary, your son has gone into coma..
..because of excess blood loss.
I don't know when he will regain consciousness.
Quickly resuscitate him, Doctor..
..otherwise, I will sent you into coma.
Send me as well, sir.
To my home, sir.
Look, sir, it was my car but your son was hit by that boy.
I don't even now how to drive a car.
I swear on him.
Let him go.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
So sweet.
Yes.
Sir, I am leaving but before leaving..
..I would like to give you a small warning.
Sir, that boy is very smart.
He is fast, in driving cars and using his brain as well.
If he will come before you he will do such actions that..
..you will forget to give reactions.
Has anyone seen that boy?
Has anyone seen that boy?
I've only seen him from the left side.
And I've only seen him from the right side.
Sir, what is this left and right.
I've seen him from centre.
Will you be able to recognize him?
You are talking about recognizing?
Actually, I was born when I was small.
My mother was a woman.
And the person who murdered my father..
..underwent plastic surgery thrice.
Yet I recognized him.
Because he used to come to our shop to buy the plastic.
From now onwards, this plastic will always be with us.
Take him away.
- No.
This is wrong.
Shut up.
- This is wrong.
Find that boy and Sanjana.
Wherever they are hiding find them.
What?
- What kind of childishness is this, Pooja?
Is this a way to behave?
Does anyone hold and push anyone like this?
How was that?
- What did you do?
Like this..
Like this..
What did you do?
- What did I do?
You held her like this and pushed her like this.
The push she got had that.
The push she got had minimal effect?
- Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
Take your position.
- From there.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Come, come, one by one.
- Come on.
Come on.
Talk to your darling nephew.
- Yes.
From the time they have returned from the jungle..
..there is a lot of fun happening around.
"it is fun.
It is fun.
It is fun."
Excuse me.
Just friends.
- Play the wedding tune.
Just friends.
Prem!
Prem, your method was wrong but your intentions were good.
Now I have no complaints against you.
- Mr. Pathak.
No.
No.
No.
My Khushi is so happy with Raju that I forgot all my sorrows.
Great.
Great.
Great.
- That's great.
You know I'm going to London.
Raju sent the tickets.
- Of economic class?
Yes.
- Yes.
How do you know that?
- Because I gave Raju the idea.
I told him not to buy first class tickets as you are such a miser..
..that you will be happy even with economic class ticket.
What happened?
- It got wet.
- What?
What is this, Daddy?
You always say double meaning things.
There is no double meaning in it.
The thing which we talk.
With which..
Mobile.
Mobile.
Mobile.
- Mobile?
My purse.
- My money.
My purse.
Your underwear.
Let's get out of this.
Today, I got that and after a long time that happened.
You got wet and fell in love?
No, I caught cold.
Today, the Sunday truly feels like a Sunday.
A Sunday will always be a Sunday.
- Yes.
We never go in the swimming pool together even if we want to, right?
Really.
- Thank you, Pooja.
- You're welcome.
Welcome.
Thank you.
I am Ready.
But there is a No Entry here.
Someone stop me.
Sir.
A junior priest has come from Guru's place.
He is here?
- Yes.
Make him comfortable..
- Yes.
The junior priest is here.
I'll go meet him and welcome him.
My wallet..
From the drawer..
That one.
Yes.
And the wallet..
Priest, why are you here?
I mean what brings you here?
I'll tell that later, but Guru is very angry with you.
Why?
- Why didn't you go to pick up Pooja from the airport?
I had gone there..
..but I got a little late.
She left to attend the wedding.
Yes, she will be going to the ashram directly from the wedding.
Be there on time to pick her up.
- As you say.
Where is everyone else?
- They are with Pooja..
But Pooja is..
- Not this one, the Pooja which was sent last month.
We sent a dog last month..
- Don't call her a dog.
The family members have named her Pooja.
They have named her Pooja?
A dog..
- Again you are calling her a dog.
Doggie, dog, puppy, pup, Raju, tommy.
Nothing.
Call her Pooja.
Otherwise with a broom..
They are so madly in love with her that nowadays we eat dog food..
Dog..
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Pooja's food.
Pedigree and White Kennel.
So what should I call her?
Pooja?
Don't call her that if you want to lose your loincloth..
..and your honour.
Hello, Priest.
They are here to serve you.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Bless you.
Bless you.
Guru had kept a 'Satyanarayan' ritual..
- Very good.
He has sent the offering of that.
Sanjana..
As soon as they call for Pooja you come with the dog.
Tell me, where is Pooja.
She is here.
Pooja.
Now what do I tell you, Priest.
We have got very attached to Pooja in such a short span.
She is so sweet that as soon as she came, Prem..
She won everyone's heart.
'Oh God, what magic has this dog done in one month?
'
Our Pooja is as decent as she is beautiful.
'A decent dog?
'
'Have they lost their mind?
'
She is now our family member.
Does she bite?
What kind of a joke is that?
Is she a suckling that she will bite?
She is of marriageable age.
It's a different thing if she starts biting after marriage.
Whether she bites, scratches or does anything else..
..we have decided that she'll be the daughter-in-law of our family.
'They will make a dog their daughter-in-law?
'
'A dog will be perfect for you, son.'
'You deserve this.'
What are you thinking about?
That is happening with Guru's permission.
'Dandiya', 'Garba' (Gujarati dance forms).
No, no, no.
That..
That..
That..
Yes.
The alliance.
- The alliance.
The alliance.
'I think they have gone absolutely crazy.'
'They didn't go to pick up the Pooja Guru had sent..'
'..from the airport.'
'They have named their dog Pooja..'
'..and they are getting him married to her.'
'I'll also go crazy if I stay here any longer]
I'll make a move.
Have lunch before you leave.
- Yes.
Pool's favourite dishes have been made today.
'Oh, God.
They are feeding dog food to a priest?
'
Look, I..
You can have it.
I'm fasting today.
I'll make a move.
- Bye.
- Okay, Priest.
- Okay, Priest.
Who is this girl?
You don't recognize her?
You are strange.
She is our maid.
You had brought her here from the ashram.
'Look at that.
These lunatics think I am crazy.'
'I hope I really don't go crazy.'
Excuse me.
I'll make a move.
Okay.
- Okay.
"Baby, I can see the sun rising in your eyes."

Maids.
- Yes, brother.
Where is everybody gone?
Brother..
Gone ashram.
Meeting Guru.
And Pooja?
- Gone.. with them too.
Why, brother?
Heart beating fasting?
Brother, where are you running?
Come on, come on.
- Come.
This is Guru's that.
What is it called..
As..
Ashram.
We've come here to fix a wedding date for your marriage with Prem.
Yes.
Let's go.
You go ahead.
We'll come.
- Okay.
Pooja, it is believed that all wishes..
Come.
Which Pooja are you talking about, Ram?
Pooja has not returned from her friend's wedding.
Then who is the one who has been staying..
..in our house as Pooja since the past few days.
Who is the scoundrel you ran away with?
Kill his entire family.
How is that possible!
You want me, right?
I'm ready to come with you.
Let's go.
Come on.
Leave me.
Brother-in-law.
Sanjana is not here.
I knew that you would surely come.
And I, too, knew that you would say..
.."I knew that you would surely come."
Why should I come, huh?
Am I your boyfriend?
I love you?
- Saw?
You are agreeing to it.
No.
Really?
He's your uncle?
Yes.
Prem, how would I tell you that..
..these goons, mafias are my maternal uncles?
Great.
Your family members are like Charles Shobraj and Ranga Billa?
I love these mafia people.
Stop joking, Prem.
You don't know how much my uncles hate each other
My mother's last wish was..
..that I get both my uncles' blessings at my wedding.
So that their enmity ends forever..
..and they become good human beings like they were, earlier.
But?
- The greed of attaining my property worth 200 crores..
..increased their enmity.
Each one of them wants me to marry his brother-in-law.
200 crores?
I can draw a cheque without deducting the TDS..
..and keep your uncles in my pocket.
But my dear, until there are obstacles in a love story..
..it is not called a love story.
What stories will we tell our children?
Look, a boyfriend gets scared of his girlfriend.
A girlfriend gets scared of a cockroach.
A cockroach gets scared of a mouse.
A mouse gets scared of a cat.
A cat gets scared of a dog.
And a dog gets scared of a man.
- And a man is scared of a woman.
- What?
Just like a villain..
gets scared of the hero.
Prem, let's go.
My uncle is here.
What now?
They will..
- Don't worry, dear.
Today, I'll predict your future.
You will get married to an innocent looking rogue.
That's me.
Now can I take some advantage?
By the way, the fitting of the Indian dress is very good.
"Ready..
I am ready for you.
Are you ready for me?"
"Are you ready for me?
Are you ready for me?"
"Are you ready for me?
I am ready for you."
Uncle, Yuvraj was forcefully..
I ran away from there.
Sit in the car.
They are drying out.
What should I do about this boy?
This boy is making me that.
That..
Irritate?
- No, not irritate.
That..
This..
This..
Emotional?
- Emotional is like this.
This..
- So?
He is making me this.
This.
This..
Crazy.
- Crazy.
- Crazy.
He is making crazy.
Crazy.
Crazy.
He lied to me.
That girl is not this but that.
What..
- Not Sanjana, Pooja.
Pooja.
Yes.
Yes.
What you are thinking of doing is not so easy.
They are dangerous.
- Yes.
They are dons.
I would've said the same had I been in your place.
But.. what would've you done had you been in my place?
Why don't you make him understand?
What should I tell him?
All I know is that Sanjana is a very nice girl.
And right now, she must be in trouble.
She must be in big trouble.
That's true, sister-in-law.
But there is no solution to this problem.
I have such a solution that I'll make the lives of both the dons, hell.
They have a common CA, who has done BA.
And his name..
What was his name?
Sounds like bully.
- Idli (a south Indian snack)?
Mooli (Radish)?
Pulley.
- Talli (drunk)?
No, close.
Close.
Khuli (open)?
Khali?
Khali.
Balli.
Balidaan Bhardwaj.
Sakku, how many times will you call me?
I feel that you call me even when you dial a wrong number.
What do I do?
You have left the house with so much cash.
I'm feeling scared.
This isn't the first time I'm out with so much cash.
I do transactions worth millions, day and night.
All 500 and 1000 denomination bills..
..across the world knows Balidaan Bhardwaj.
Then?
- That's fine.
But what if a thief stabs you and robs you?
Sakku, are you concerned about me..
..or are you trying to kill me?
Hang up, Sakku.
I want two demands drafts made.
One of 30 lakhs and the other of 20 lakhs.
Take this.
My bag?
My bag!
Where did my bag go?
Where is my bag?
There was 50 lakhs in the bag.
Where did the bag go?
My bag.
My bag got stolen.
Have you seen a thief here?
- No.
You blind man, you didn't see the thief?
You didn't even see such a big bag?
I didn't see it.
I'm not the owner of it.
You..
Have you seen your face?
It's so black that if shown on National Television..
..it will ward off evil from the entire country.
Sakku, what you said came true.
Sakku.
What happened?
Amar Chaudhary and Suraj Chaudhary's 50 lakhs got stolen.
What?
Don't do this.
Pack the bags.
It's time to leave the city.
Come on.
- Yes.
They are here.
Tell them I am not here.
I'll go and hide myself.
Mr. Bhardwaj.
Mr. Bhardwaj.
He has not only left this house but this world as well.
A trunk ran over him.
- Oh, no.
He got crushed.
Do you have anyone to look after you in this cruel world?
No.
By the way, I had brought this bag for him.
What will I do of this briefcase when he is no more?
Don't worry.
I'll take care of both his belongings.
Okay?
Let's meet after his final rites.
Thank you.
Bring it here.
Where are you going?
You are alive, sir?
- Yes, I'm alive.
It's her hobby.
She kills her husband over everything.
Start wearing a wedding chain from tomorrow.
People get mistaken.
She is mine.
And.. this bag is also mine.
There are only 50 lakhs in it, right, sir?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
There are only 50 lakhs..
Just a minute.
How did you come to know that there are 50 lakhs in it?
Just be looking at the bundle of the notes..
..I can predict how many notes it contains.
How?
- I learnt this art from my master.
Mr. B. B., sir.
Bishan Singh Bedi?
- No, sir.
Then?
Balibhrambhat.
- No, no, sir.
Bichun Bhutia.
Goal.
No way, sir.
The one who has written this book.
Mr. Balidaan Bhardwaj.
Be careful, sir.
I've written a book?
When did I write this book?
Such a fat book?
You?
- Yes.
Look at this.
The Balidaan in front of Bhardwaj is me.
That's me.
This is a sign of a genius.
You wrote a book and you don't even remember.
Sir, this book is a missile and you are an example..
..for a newcomer like me.
I have come to this city to be your assistant, sir.
I see.
- I want to learn the ropes of this job with you.
I don't want any money either.
- Then my job is done.
I mean your job is done.
- Thank you, sir.
I have only two clients.
Amar Chaudhary and Suraj Chaudhary.
Sir, they are mafias.
One is a mongoose.
And the other one is a snake.
If they get together then they are killer sharks.
But both of them are illiterates.
How many times during a year do you think..
..people like Chaudhary must be paying their taxes?
Sir, they must not even be paying the taxi fare.
Sir..
I make them pay tax every month.
Every month?
Again and again.
- Again and again.
12 times.
- 12 times.
Yes.
What do I do?
It is dirty but it is my business.
It is your business.
This is the only way to teach a lesson to those goons.
Sir, your name is Balidaan but you are making your clients sacrifice.
Now that you have joined me..
..everyone will be sacrificed..
with Prem (love).
Come with us.
Come with us.
- Why are you hitting me?
Hit him.
Stop.
Stop.
Don't hit me.
Stop.
Stop.
I am your teacher, Amar Chaudhary.
Teacher?
You are a cheater, you scoundrel.
You give me a zero in the exams.
You gave the wrong answer.
What was the question?
Who is the president of India?
- Mrs. Pratibha Patil.
You had said that it was Abdul Kalam.
The president got changed.
It is my fault that the president got changed?
What do I have to do with when and where Alexander fought Porus?
Do I have to go there and dig their graves?
Hit him.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Well done.
You are doing well, Amar Chaudhary.
Saw that?
That's why I named him after me.
Amar Chaudhary.
Hey, Amar Chaudhary!
You stinky insect of a dirty sewer?
Mother, you go inside.
- Stop barking, you dog.
And let him go.
Otherwise I'll poison your food and feed you.
Got it?
Hey, go.
Take him back with dignity.
Go.
Yes.
- Go.
Let's go, sir.
Grandpa, you are being abused under his pretext.
No, no. it's not so.
You are like a father to my daughter-in-law.
You are God.
A born leech.
- What?
See that.
He is.
This Amar Chaudhary.
It's time for school.
Don't you have to go?
Father, should I get something for you?
Yes, daughter-in-law.
Get some tea for me.
Okay.
- Without sugar.
And without poison.
Have some sweets, Mr. Chaudhary.
I got the land for your liquor factory cleared.
And it hardly cost you anything.
Only 50 lakhs.
Balli.
- Yes.
Don't you know you cannot bring strangers in here?
Who is he?
- He's my nephew.
Nephew?
- Yes, look.
We look similar, don't we?
You mean when I am of your age I will look like you?
Forget about the face, Mr. Chaudhary.
Talk about brains.
He is from America.
He will show your income so less..
..that you won't need to pay tax.
- Really?
You know the billionaire in America?
K.K. Modi.
He used to handle his account.
K. K. Modi?
- K. K. Modi?
Forget it.
Forget K. K. Modi.
Now that you are here you work for Mr. Chaudhary.
Handle his account.
Hire you nephew.
- Nephew!
Grandpa, it sounds like your business.
Ganja.
Balli.
- Yes?
You didn't teach your nephew how to salute?
Salute me.
What to get thrashed?
What did you say?
- No.
I saw my horoscope in the morning.
Yes.
- In it it's written that if I salute..
..anyone younger than me today..
..then he will get thrashed all day long.
But still if you want..
- No, no.
Let it be.
But I have read his horoscope.
Balli.
Come on.
- Let it be, today.
My nephew is with me.
So..
Balli.
Yes.
Now my hands feel warmer.
The apple of my eye.
My brave boy.
- Wild hippo, Amar Chaudhary.
Write 'Welcome' on your face.
You will look like a rotten doormat.
Anyway, your ponytail looks like a dead dog's tail.
Look at your grandpa.
It suits him so well.
Take this.
Stupid.
Go to school.
Yes, grandpa.
This is the first time mother has said the right thing.
The girls in my class tease me.
They said it looks like theirs.
With your permission can I chop it off?
Amar Chaudhary, you can have your neck cut but not your ponytail.
This is a warning, not advice.
We are samurais.
This is the identity of our family.
Your l.D. proof.
It is a voter's card, pan card.
Your blood group.
A proof that you are his grandson and he is your grandpa.
Where did this boring old man come from?
Great grandpa.
I saw you.
Today my day will go well.
Concentrate on your studies.
Kids of your age have gone places.
People of your age as well..
..have gone places.
"Happy days are over."
"Now I'm surrounded with sadness."
What is this, Mr. Lehri?
What are you doing?
I'm having black coffee with Obama in the White House.
Can't you see?
I hit the brakes to give you a lift.
Now my shirt has turned into a mop.
All this happened because of me, right?
I'm feeling very guilty.
I love you too.
Now it is my duty to get you out of here.
I also want to leave.
Because if my children grow up they won't recognize me.
And my wife is so nave that the poor thing..
..might once again run away with someone.
No such thing will happen because I have a mind-blowing idea.
This is the boy with whom Sanjana ran away, sir.
He doesn't look like he is from our city.
I'll find him even if he is hiding underground.
Are you telling the truth?
Sir, if I am lying he should die immediately.
No, I take his oath and say that henceforth..
..that that boy was not him but someone else.
Sir.
- What happened?
Sir, someone has come to meet you.
Balli, you got the land cleared for Amar for his liquor factory?
I just got the land cleared for him.
But for you along with the land I also got..
..the license for the liquor factory cleared.
Lehri, go.
You are free to go.
Mr. Chaudhary, I am leaving but before leaving..
..I would like to give you a warning.
Sir, this boy is very smart.
Only I know how he traps people.
You won't be able to anything to him..
..even if he comes and stands before you.
You do one thing.
You keep cleaning cars here till Sanjana's marriage.
Sir, what are you saying?
Sir, this is a crime. it's a sin.
Mr. Chaudhary, you cannot do this.
Mr. Chaudhary can do anything.
He is Justice Chaudhary.
He provides justice to good people.
And he clears out the bad people.
Pick him and throw him out.
Balli, who is this boy?
He is a con.
C-0-N.
Con.
He joined hands with that girl and fooled me.
Which animal have I left out?
- You dog, clean the car.
Mr. Chaudhary, isn't the boy useful?
Once I start working, there will be no income and no tax.
No income tax.
But Balli, how is this possible?
This boy will work for Amar as well as us.
He has a habit..
..of doing two things together.
You know K.K. Modi in America?
He used to also handle his younger brother B.K. Modi's account.
But what if he turns out to be bad?
Then you can behead my uncle.
Behead me?
- Saw?
He agrees to it.
The thumb impression on the file.
Take it.
Just a minute.
Uncle, I was casually checking your accounts.
There are a lot of discrepancies.
What?
- There must be a slight difference.
21.
- 21..
Balli.
There is a difference of Rs.21.
Rs.21, dear?
It's hardly a difference.
Just a minute, uncle.
You are his assistant, right?
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on, show me the accounts.
Uncle, I'll go and check the accounts properly.
Yes, yes.
Okay, dear.
Hey..
Persuade her.
- Consider it done.
Balli, you saw how my niece's education is benefiting me?
Prem, this is not the right situation to take advantage.
Really?
Then promise me that you will meet me tonight.
And you will let me take all the advantages.
- Prem.
YOU..
You okay?
- Yes.
I was just joking.
Balli, why do you look as if you've seen a ghost?
Our future daughter-in-law is checking everything, right?
Yes.
In detail.
Come with me.
Come with me.
Let them work.
Saw that?
My future wife is no ordinary girl.
Yes, I just came to know.
She has taken after me deceased sister.
So, your sister was also like her?
Then the entire family..
What happened?
He is getting scared.
- He fears he might get caught.
Sanjana..
Sanjana is not my daughter.
She is more than a daughter to me, Prem.
Her happiness means everything to me.
But..
But you don't know her uncles.
They..
- I know.
They are rogues from the Neanderthal times.
Orthodox.
I am a modern age dog.
Latest.
When we will fight, I will eat them up.
"I am a dog and she is my partner."
"I tell the truth, when she came.."
"..there came a season to eat everyone up."
Stop it.
Look, aunt, everything will be fine.
I promise.
What were you doing inside?
All that cuddling and all?
Uncle, she fell over me.
Girls from affluent families..
Hello.
Girls from affluent families are like that.
Try to understand.
Whether she falls on you or you fall on her..
..our necks will get cut and fall down.
Uncle, you only asked me to persuade her.
I got persuaded.
You would've got exposed..
..if she would've opened the accounts.
This is the first time I have let a girl touch me and you..
No, no.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
You are my disciple.
Come on, get in.
Get in.
Let's go.
Let's go.
"In 12 months I'll express my love to you in 12 different ways."
"Now I think I won't be able to survive.."
"..even for 12 minutes without you."
"When the winter season starts in January."
"We will switch on the heater of love."
"In a blanket as small as February.."
"..we will play hide and seek."
"March will be a romantic month."
"We'll do something we have never done before."
"What if we aren't able to meet in April?"
"What will happen?
Find a solution."
"I'll get an internet connection so that I can chat with you."
"When the summer season starts in May.."
"..we will party at the poolside."
"We will take a long vacation in June."
"We will go to a hill station."
"When starts raining in July.."
"..
I'll yearn to embrace you."
"We will have a lot of fun in August."
"We will make some arrangements."
"I'll take you to London.
I'll give you a tour of Paris."
"I'll take you on a world tour."
"l feel that I'll be coming often to your house in September."
"We'll see the sunsets together in October."
"You can keep your head on my shoulders."
"By the time the wretch November comes.."
"..you would've already surrendered your heart."
"Things will get confirmed on 12th December."
"With the confirmation from our hearts."
"There will be no car or mare."
"I'll bring the wedding procession on foot."
"In 12 months I'll express my love to you in 12 different ways."
"Now I think I won't be able to survive.."
"..even for 12 minutes without you."
Prem hasn't come as yet, dear.
Don't worry, aunt.
He will surely come.
Why don't you go and pay your respects..
..as you have come to the temple, Junior Chaudhary?
Tell me.
I prayed for a week before my exams.
He failed me.
- Then why have you come here?
I'm my grandpa's junior spy.
Whenever any female in the family goes out of the house..
..I keep an eye on them.
Whether they are going and meeting our enemies.
Aunt.
Go.
My child.
Bless you.
- That's enough.
Bless you.
Sister.
Someone stop them.
You are crying?
They are bound to cry.
These sisters-in-law love each other more than their own sister.
In spite of living in the same city we have met after ages.
Our men our fighting and we women are suffering.
I wonder when this will end.
Like I have united the aunts I will unite the uncles as well.
If I don't turn this family into a 'Hum Aapke Hain Kaun' family..
..then don't call me Prem.
Thank you.
Okay, so you are befriending our enemies..
..in the pretext of praying and worshiping?
Son, she isn't an enemy.
She is your grandaunt.
Amar, my child.
- Don't touch me, you old woman.
Scoundrel, if you say a word more..
..I'll feed you kerosene and light a match in front of your mouth.
Get out of here.
Forgive him, sister.
His grandfather has made him just like him.
I wonder when he will mend his ways.
Why are you laughing?
He will change, but I'm laughing..
..thinking of the way in which he will change.
Junior Chaudhary, the park is closed.
It's closed for others, not me.
Go and tell the manager, Amar Chaudhary is here.
The park will remain open.
Okay, sir.
- Okay, sir.
Come here, you animal.
Salute me.
The park should be closed now.
We have to go home.
You are refusing Amar Chaudhary?
Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
Come.
How dare you!
I won't spare you.
Who..
Who are you?
Badman.
Badman?
- Yes.
I'm here to turn a bad boy like you into a good boy.
You..
One kick and from Badman you will become a dead man.
Kick me.
Kick me.
Kick me.
Really?
Here you go.
Darn him.
I am sorry, bad-man.
Spare me.
Forgive me.
Okay.
From today, you'll be a good boy.
Yes, I will.
You won't bunk school.
- Okay.
You won't trouble your teachers.
You'll always respect your elders.
And you will cut your ponytail as well.
- Yes.
No, no.
This is not possible.
It is the identity of my family.
Shut up.
The kid has tired me.
First try to talk things out.
If they don't understand then kick them.
Great, Balli.
Great.
Your nephew is one in a million.
Amar Chaudhary.
Why do you have bandana on your head?
It's the latest fashion, grandpa.
Okay.
Okay.
Fashion.
Come here, my tiger.
And hit on this jackal's head.
Bless me, uncle Balli.
What are you doing?
Respecting my elders, grandfather.
This is what Badman has taught us.
Who Badman?
- He is our new teacher, grandpa.
Teacher?
Grandpa, his new teacher is Prem.
Dear, now I feel he'll also bring my two scoundrels back on track.
Hello
Uncle, uncle Suraj is once again trying to get me married to Veer.
What?
- Yes.
But I want to marry your son, Yuvraj.
Yuvraj?
- Please, uncle.
Please, do something.
Please, quickly get me out of here.
Someone is coming.
Come on, get the cars out.
Load your guns.
Let there be bloodshed?
We will have to bring Sanjana at any cost by this evening.
What are you doing, Chaudhary..
Sir.
Uncle, tell them.
What you are doing is wrong.
You are going to kill your brother for 200 crores?
Whereas someone worth 500 crores is in uncle's pocket.
Who are you talking about?
Uncle, I'm talking about K.K Modi.
Yes.
K.K. Modi from America.
Tell them how much he is worth.
He is worth 5000-7000 crores.
And hear this.
You know who has been given..
..the responsibility of getting his daughter Naina married?
Uncle.
Uncle, you couldn't see this gem of a person?
Whereas Naina desires a gem of a person.
They are such lovely people.
They are romantic.
They are going to kill their brothers.
Uncle, if I wouldn't have thought of this..
..then there would've been a bloodshed today.
Why don't you think?
No, the idea was on the way in my mind..
..but because of traffic..
Get this straight, Balli.
If we don't get this alliance then consider yourself death.
Get out of here.
I took K.K. Modi's name just like that.
You added his daughter to the story.
You added the responsibility of her marriage.
You added all the spices.
Sir, you told me all this..
after having a few drinks.
I told you about people who don't exist?
They exist, sir.
Listen.
- Yes?
Some K.K. Modi has called five times since morning.
He told me to remind you that he is coming..
..to India on Friday to discuss his daughter's wedding.
And yes, he has asked to book some resort.
Don't forget.
How is this possible?
Sir, this means you either have MP or UP.
Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh?
MP means memory power.
- Okay.
Sir, in this illness the battery of memory conks off.
Or UP that is unbelievable power.
Unbelievable power.
- Yes, sir.
In this the characters you think about come in real life.
I don't believe this.
That's why it is called unbelievable power.
Now you have to decide whether..
..it's your effective thinking or defective disease.
Meanwhile, sir, you have thrown me out of the house.
Bye-.
Taxi!
- No, Prem.
I said that as I was worried.
Please.
Okay.
- Don't leave me in such confusion.
Okay, sir.
Tell me what I should do next.
There is no option or resort to this.
Yes, the last resort is that you book a resort.
Okay.
They have come?
Limo.
Ballu.
Ballu.
Uncle, go and welcome Modi.
What a pleasant surprise.
Come here.
Come here.
Give your friend a hug.
You have become fit.
I think it is the result of sister-in-law Shakuntala's that.
Love.
- Her love.
How is sister-in-law Sakku?
I hope you didn't have any that on the way.
What is it..
No, no.
One has to take some that for one's child.
Some..
Trouble.
- Yes, trouble.
Let's go.
Mr. Modi.
- Mr. Modi.
Stop.
Is this a way to ask for donations?
Mr. Modi, he is Mr. Chaudhary.
A very famous L in the city.
- Landlord?
- Landlord.
- Landlord.
Mr. Modi, welcome, welcome, welcome.
Welcome.
Uncle Modi.
Aunt Modi.
Balli works for us.
Okay, Balli knows you.
That means he is our that..
Guest.
- Guest.
Guest.
Call him tonight for..
- Drinks?
Dinner.
Dinner.
And that as well.
Let's go.
Why are you staring at them with your mouth open?
Have you seen them for the first time?
Anyone will give that reaction on seeing Mr. Modi.
Sir, if you are a mouse then he is a cat.
If you are a cat, he is a dog.
If you are a dog, he is a fox.
If you are a fox then he is a lion.
If you are lion then he is an elephant.
If you are an elephant then he is a dinosaur.
Dinosaur of business, sir.
For your own good, come on time for dinner.
Otherwise you are a donkey, sir.
Who is going anywhere?
I am here till night.
Yes.
- Yes.
Let's go.
What happened, uncle?
He met me with so much affection.
He gave me a hug as well.
But I couldn't recognize him.
Is it an illness or my imagination?
Both.
- Both?
One personality is ill.
It is the imagination of the other personality.
The first and the second personality clashed..
..with each other and resulted in the third personality.
Split personality.
The fourth personality will be suicidal personality.
You will feel like committing suicide, uncle.
You are right.
- No.
I feel like committing suicide.
- No.
Yes.
- Don't do it, uncle.
- Why?
You won't remember that you have committed suicide, uncle.
So what should I do?
Uncle, now you have only one option left.
What?
- Believe that your personality with imagination is right.
You know him.
He is K.K. Modi.
- You recognize him.
I'll have to.
Otherwise, I'll commit suicide..
..and I won't even remember it.
So what's the use?
He is K.K. Modi.
Mr. Modi, we are not as rich as you are.
But we are well respected in the city.
Great.
- Yes, sir.
They are decent people.
Really?
- They have a lot of cars and are cultured as well.
So brother, tell us, how much loan do you want?
No, sister-in-law, I am..
Balli, tell them.
- What should I say?
Uncle, with your permission can I tell them?
- Yes, please.
Mr. Modi, he is his brother-in-law.
Yuvraj.
He has studied till the 8th grade.
The 8th grade.
Raise two more fingers.
Yes, the 8th grade.
He has studied till the 8th grade.
So?
He wants to marry your daughter.
- What?
Brother Ballu, you have brought such an alliance?
Have you seen their faces?
They look as if they have just come out of a jungle.
Right.
Will their daughter marry into this illiterate family?
The Modis.
They don't have any sense of that.
Fashion.
Nor do they know how to that.
- Talk.
To talk.
They look like that.
That..
Ape-men.
- Ape-men.
If you weren't my friend I would have done that.
Shot.
- Shot you.
Let's go..
- Sumitra.
- Sumitra.
Let's go.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- Okay.
You ruined their mood.
- Shut up.
Shut up.
YOU..
I'll blow your head with you, you scoundrel.
You fool, he isn't a scoundrel, you are.
Do you know who are you messing with?
You can only make scrabbled-eggs from an egg.
Mr. Modi can turn scrabbled-eggs back to an egg.
You have spoilt the whole game.
But it's okay.
Uncle is here.
He will think of something.
What will I think of?
I am totally confused.
Will you tell us what this is all about?
Why have you made us all wear sunglasses?
Excuse me for my language, grandpa.
But what do these Modis think of themselves?
They have kept three conditions for the wedding.
I told them that I won't be able to look into your eyes..
..after telling you those conditions.
And you won't be able to look at each other after hearing them.
He said, "Here, make them wear these sunglasses.."
"..and tell them the conditions."
Tell us.
Tell us, what their conditions are.
Basically the Modis have made..
..the tent of Chaudhary's lives stand on three sticks.
Condition No. 1.
They don't like the way you dress.
What are you doing?
They say that you look like a C-Grade movie's villain.
How dare they!
This..
This is what uncle said.
How dare they!
- Yes.
Yes.
The Chaudharys will never change..
..their dressing sense for their 500 crores.
- Yes.
500..
- Crores.
Okay.
Okay.
We will wear up-to-date suits.
Yes.
- Yes.
Yes.
What is their second condition?
Their family is a joint family like in the movie 'Hum Aapke Hain Kaun'.
They all live together.
So is our family like in the movie 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham'?
We stay separately?
They have never seen you out on a lunch or a picnic..
..with your daughters and daughters-in-law.
- Enough.
They are womenfolk.
This tradition has been going on since ages.
This is what uncle said as well.
- What?
That the Chaudharys will never change their tradition for 500 crores.
Yes.
- 500 crores.
Fine.
Fine.
Listen.
Listen.
Henceforth, we'll all be together.
Tell me the third condition.
If I tell you the third condition then.. your pants will tear.
Pants?
-I am saying this.
I am saying this.
He had said something else.
Tell me the condition.
You'll have to cut it.
- What?
You'll have to cut your ponytail.
- No.
Even uncle yelled and said no.
- Yes.
Yes.
But what can we do?
They hold the trump card of 500 crores.
500 crores. 500 crores.
Cut them, Amar.
You can always grow them back.
But you don't often get a harvest worth 500 crores.
Great.
Now you are looking that and that.
Bold and beautiful.
- Bold and the beautiful.
So tell us, brother.
What have you decided?
What have I..
What do you say, Ballu?
Should I do that?
Yes?
- Do it.
Now that you have found a diamond..
..better set it in the ring.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Fine, then I'll call my daughter and younger that tomorrow.
Brother.
- Brother.
Okay.
- Do you have relatives or brothers or something like that?
No.
He has an elder brother..
Name?
- Suraj Chaudhary.
In spite of having an elder brother..
..you have come alone to fix the alliance?
Where is he?
How can he come here?
We don't get along.
A house where brothers don't that..
- Get along.
Get long.
Will their daughter go there?
- The Modis.
The Modis.
What he means is that their timings don't match.
He is sometimes out and he is sometimes in.
These two brothers love each other a lot.
Like..
Lord Rama and Laxman.
- Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So call them tonight.
Match the..
Timings.
- Timing.
Yes.
Consider it to be our that..
- Condition.
- Yes.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Don't hit my uncle.
What was the need to say..
- Sister-in-law, please, help.
That I have an elder brother?
I said it because you have one.
You could have said that he is dead.
You are strange.
How could say that?
Till date you haven't been able to kill him.
So uncle, how will you kill him?
But we are dead now.
That old man will never listen to us.
Hey, when God gave uncle a head over his shoulders..
..he didn't give it for decoration.
He will think.
He will think of something.
He will bring your brother by his ears.
Shut up.
Suraj Chaudhary will behead me even if I talk about it.
And if he doesn't come here then I'll behead you.
What?
Hey, let us go in.
Move aside.
Side.
Side.
Side.
- Who are you?
Keep distance.
Horn please.
May the face of the one with ill-intentions in his heart go black!
Seize the whole place.
Take everyone's mobiles.
Disconnect their phone.
Hey, who are you?
In this manner..
This is how we enter.
You have all the right to remain silent..
..as this is a raid.
I pay income tax thirteen times a year.
Yet there is a raid?
Sir, Ms. Sanjana.
Hello, uncle Mathur.
Hello, dear.
How are you?
Sanjana, you know these income-tax guys?
Aunt, they are not from the income-tax department.
They are from the World Bank.
I have heard of Punjab Bank and Allahabad Bank.
What is a World Bank?
The one outside Punjab and Allahabad is called World Bank.
The father of all banks.
And the mother of all banks.
Uncle and aunt of all banks.
But, sir, what are you doing here?
Ms. Sanjana's father had taken a loan of 200 crores from our bank.
So?
- So he passed away before he could settle the loan.
So?
- He keeps on saying 'so'.
He will lose his mind when he will hear this.
So, we have seized all his property in America.
We have managed to get back 100 crores.
We still need to recover 100 crores.
But Sanjana doesn't hold any property here.
She came here to get married to me.
Fantastic.
After marriage a wife has equal right over the property.
Hence, according to law, we will recover 100 crores from you.
The bungalow itself must be worth 50-60 crores.
Come, let's go.
Let's go.
Mr. Lover, I knew that you would get this marriage canceled.
But what is this issue of 100 crores?
Should I tell you everything today itself?
What's the rush?
Where are you going?
You are here.
Polish them.
Balli, what kind of a law is this?
The law is according to the place.
Uncle, including this house and other things..
..you will manage to arrange 100 crores, right?
You, too, wouldn't want my deceased father..
..to owe a loan to anyone, right?
Listen, assistant.
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on, let's check the value of the property.
Okay.
- Again?
No.
Actually I have some work with him.
Not now.
Okay?
Fine.
We will begin once your work is done.
Okay, ma'am.
How much work will you do?
You will get tired.
You..
- Everyone is standing here.
It's written in the scriptures, uncle..
..the more you work the better it is.
This girl will put me on streets to beg.
Now I got it.
Why did he break the alliance with this girl..
..and formed an alliance with K.K. Modi.
He knows that this girl has a loan over her head.
Balli.
- Yes.
Instead of us, you got K.K. Modi's daughter..
..alliance fixed into Amar's family.
If he has ruined it, he will mend it.
How?
- How?
You know B.K. Modi.
- Who is B.K. Modi?
You only had said that K.K. Modi has a younger brother.
Yes.
Yes.
He does.
He does.
K.K. Modi has a younger brother.
But what about him?
- His money.
What about his money?
You only had said..
That he is richer..
..than his elder brother when it comes to money.
- What?
Yes.
Yes.
I said so.
But what about him?
- His daughter.
Daughter.
- Daughter.
His daughter's..
mother will also be there.
What about his daughter?
You had taken the responsibility of getting her married.
Wow, Balli.
No matter what you say that's a great condition.
Not condition, connection.
- Whatever.
But tell him Mr. Modi's conditions.
Yes, ma'am.
Coming.
I'll go and check the property.
I'll see how much worth it is.
Darling Balli, what conditions do these Modis have?
"Forgot tradition and became ready."
"if they get it right they will make it big."
"Money can make you do anything."
Amar!
- Brother!
Brother!
Where is your party?
Has gone to pickup your party at the airport.
Where did she come from?
Did you call her?
It feels very nice to see the two of you together today, uncle.
Now my problem is also over.
Now both of you decide who I should marry.
Dear, you should forget Veer.
Last night your mother visited me in my dreams.
And she said, "Veer isn't good enough for my Sanjana."
So the confusion is over.
I will get married to Yuvraj.
No, no, no, no, no, dear.
Yuvraj is absolutely useless.
Your mother visited me in my dreams as well.
She started crying.
She said, "Brother, don't ruin my Sanjana's life.
More tears.
What about me?
Will I stay single all my life?
- Not at all, dear.
We, your uncles are there for you.
We will find someone good enough for you.
Nice, capable and decent.
We will have a grand wedding for you.
Why do you worry, dear?
We are there for you.
- Yes.
Okay, uncle.
Whatever you feel is right.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Meet him.
He's my younger brother..
B.K..
- B.K. Modi.
Yes.
Modi.
- Look who it is.
Ballu.
How are you, Ballu?
Hi, B.K. How are you?
- You look fit.
I think sister-in-law's love has played its trick.
How is sister-in-law, Sakku?
She's absolutely fine.
She keeps talking about all of you.
How is B.K?
What is he doing these days?
- That's fine.
Mr. Modi, the girls didn't come with you?
To hell with the girls.
- What?
- What?
He means say hello to Naina and Sunaina.
Yes, they are the apple of their mothers' eyes.
Naina.
- Sunaina.
They both are great, aren't they?
Walk straight.
What are you thinking about, uncle?
What are you thinking about?
I couldn't recognize the other Modi as well.
Uncle, this means it's not an illness but an imagination.
You mean the character I think about, comes to life?
Yes.
You have the power.
Otherwise, how is it possible, uncle.
What will we call a person with such imagination?
We cannot call him human.
You mean I am..
God?
Brahma.
The Creator.
The creator of the universe.
Balli.
Look..
How they address God.
Idiots.
He has regained consciousness.
Now we will have fun.
Mr. Chaudhary, he is out of coma, but he is unable to speak.
How can he not speak?
Son..
Tell me, who was he?
Speak up.
Tell me.
Who was he?
Tell me, son.
Try to speak.
Try.
Uncle, why is he pointing towards you?
Balli.
This means you..
No, sir.
I cannot even put a comma to sentence.
How can I put him into coma?
Mr. Chaudhary, your son is still not out of coma.
His mind is spinning hence he is moving his finger here and there.
Look, now he is pointing towards him.
Mr. Chaudhary, your son's condition is so bad..
..that he might even point his finger towards you.
Oh, my.
The son is pointing towards his father.
Please go out.
The patient is getting hyper.
Doctor, make my son get well soon.
Because the day he will come out of coma..
..someone else will go into coma.
Let's go.
Let's go.
There are so many sorrows in this world.
Your sorrow is so less.
You aren't able to say anything..
..because of your unconscious state.
And he cannot say anything even when he is conscious.
So sad is this and how bad is that.
Continue.
Sir.
No, sir.
Madam..
- Move back.
I don't care.
Please sir.
Sir, please.
- It's not my problem..
..as to with whom Mr. Chaudhary..
..is having his breakfast and his lunch.
Mr. Chaudhary, I've been looking for you all over the city.
And you are having fun over here.
You are having parties.
I'm being pressurized by the bank.
I keep getting phone calls.
Tell me what you want to do.
Mr. Modi, you are here?
What a pleasant surprise.
Hello, sister-in-law.
- Hello, brother.
Sister-in-law, it seems like you have come here on a holiday.
No, brother.
Our daughters are getting that with the brothers-in-law.
They are getting married with the brothers-in-law.
Mr. Suraj.
- Yes.
Your brother-in-law Veer was going to marry your niece, right?
No.
Niece?
Who is his niece?
Here she is.
Sanjana.
She is a very nice girl.
Why do you want to get related to us instead of her?
Actually, what happened was..
- For Sanjana's happiness.
Sanjana doesn't like Veer and that's why..
..Mr. Chaudhary cancelled the wedding.
Great people.
This is very that.
- Good.
- Good.
A very good thing.
But brother, it's wrong as well.
Look brother, there is a young unmarried girl in their family.
And they are getting their brothers-in-law married.
It is wrong, isn't it?
- True.
It is not so.
Mr. Chaudhary is looking for a suitable boy for her.
He will get her married as soon as he finds a suitable boy.
Take your time and find a boy.
We are here for four days.
Look, first Sanjana will get married then our daughters will.
But Mr. Modi..
- No ifs or buts.
Consider this to be our that.
- Condition.
- Our condition.
Yes.
- Another condition?
Don't worry.
All the four Chaudharys are charged.
They will do something in four days.
Great people.
People, everybody join me please.
"Whether you are a crescent or the moonlight."
"No matter what you are.."
"..
I swear on God, you are great."
Clap, everyone.
Great.
Great.
Brother, the Chaudharys might get a heart attack..
..listening to your conditions.
Brother has kept a condition of Sanjana's wedding.
- Yes.
But you'll have to give the idea that our Prem will be her groom.
This condition has been kept to give this idea.
Okay.
- But they are very dangerous people.
If they find out the truth..
There is one person who is very dangerous.
Lehri.
He is very smart.
But he has already said such a big lie..
..that now if he tells the truth, he will be the first one to die.
'okay, so this is his family and not the Modi family.'
Mr. Balidaan.
The poor thing is standing as a statue.
Fine, I will bring it into life.
Brother.
Brother.
Brother.
I have come here to tell you a secret.
Here he is.
Here he is.
You are doing pushups?
No, I'm pushing the ground down.
Keep quiet.
Keep quiet.
Tell me, who am I?
Am I God?
Am I a human being?
Who am I?
You are the first God with has been made by this human being.
What not have you made me?
Now even I have forgotten who I am.
I have become the Aamir Khan in the movie 'Ghajini'.
Look here.
Look at this.
You have no idea how difficult it is to write on your back!
Ra$Cal.
You played such a big game with a genius like me..
..who has written such a famous book?
Give me the book, please.
Here you go, genius.
I won't let you win as long as I am alive.
What will I do?
Mr. Balli, Mr. Chaudhary is calling you.
Go.
You have been summoned.
Yes.
Yes, I've put the ball in the hole.
I've learnt to play golf.
This is how we used to play marbles as well.
You are right.
- Greetings, sir.
Come.
Come, Mr. Balidaan.
Come.
- You summoned me?
We have known each other since ages.
Why don't we turn this acquaintance into a relationship?
I didn't get you.
Your nephew Prem and our niece Sanjana.
Let's get them married.
- No.
No, this marriage cannot take place.
- Why not?
You are a servant.
We are your employer.
You don't like the respect we are giving you?
Why cannot this marriage take place, uncle?
We are their loyal servants.
We have to pay them back in someway or the other.
Right, uncle?
- Don't touch me.
You see, the girl has a loan of 100 crores over her head.
That too of the World Bank.
Who will pay it back?
You?
- We will pay it back.
We are going to get millions from the Modis.
You can keep 100-125 out of it.
Not 125, only 100 crores.
The amount of the loan.
After that even if you sent your daughter..
..without any clothes on, we will accept her.
Great.
Right, uncle?
We accept it, don't we?
- Yes.
Sanjana, my child..
I accept this match, uncle.
Uncle, your teeth will break if you will grind them so hard.
Mr. Chaudhary, there is a problem.
This Lehri keeps saying that Sanjana..
..had eloped with a boy during her wedding.
If someone comes to know about it on my wedding day..
..then my uncle will be defamed.
Can you please take care of this Lehri, sir?
Go and find Lehri.
- Get him here.
Yes, Mr. Chaudhary?
- Who eloped with Sanjana?
This..
What is this that you are asking me?
I had shown you the photograph.
A lie.
You are lying.
He had eloped with Sanjana.
You are right.
He had eloped with her.
Forgive me, I had lied.
He is the one I had given a lift to.
Henceforth, this is what you should tell everyone.
Got it?
Are you happy now, Prem?
Yes, Mr. Chaudhary.
Mr. Lehri, you don't know what a big favour..
..you have done to my uncle and the Chaudhary family.
God will surely send you to heaven.
Congratulations, Balli.
You became their that.
What is it?
Yes, their relative.
Mr. Modi, you are the one who gave us this idea.
Otherwise, how could we ever think of this?
Have this.
Why did you unnecessarily take the that.
Trouble.
You go and have your meal.
- We'll all have together.
No, we don't know how long we will take.
Why should you stay that because of us?
Hungry.
Go, have your meal.
- Okay.
I love you.
That's great, Mr. Modi.
At your place the women eat before the men do.
At our place, till we do eat, the women will die but..
..not touch the food.
This is wrong.
Look, women live in a very that world.
Small.
It begins from and ends at us.
The house and kids.
She is that in them.
What is it said?
Yes, restricted.
Hence it is our duty to look after them.
We should love them.
We should always keep them that.
We should keep them happy.
Radhika..
What happened?
Nothing.
You have your meal.
Before you?
- So what?
If I drink all night along ill you stay hungry till the morning?
What is wrong with you, today?
Love.
I love you.
Sorry.
Shalu.
Shalu?
- Yes, Shalani.
Now I will always call you Shalu.
And henceforth, you can eat before me.
Why so?
- Because I love you.
Thank you.
Brother, Prem is nowhere to be seen.
Sanjana is not here either.
They got what they wanted.
The lovebirds must be busy at some corner.
Yes, so what is wrong in that?
They both that to each other.
They love each other.
They are going to get married.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Come, let's go and have some food.
Come on.
Look, Prem and Sanjana are also back.
Come on.
The bride and the groom are also here.
Let me make an announcement.
I have decided that this marriage won't take place.
What?
- What?
Once again uncle must have gone into the 100 crore loop..
..after having a little too much to drink.
Balli, what are you saying?
Keep quiet.
Keep quiet.
You are saying Balli and sacrificing me
This marriage won't take place.
If uncle doesn't want this marriage to take place then..
Without uncle, I don't want to marry like an orphan.
Since when did you become an orphan, you liar?
Here he is.
Your father is here in a three-piece suit.
He is here.
Fine.
Fine.
Fine, Ballu.
If you are breaking your that with him.
Then I will form a that with him.
What is it?
Yes, a relationship.
Henceforth, I am your father.
And I am your mother.
I'm your uncle.
I'm your aunt.
If you are falling short of relatives then I, too, shall become one?
Why..
Why would you become anyone?
You are his uncle.
Keep it fixed.
Then it is fixed.
- Yes.
Henceforth, I am his uncle.
-And I am his aunt.
Look at that.
They all are telling the truth.
Chaudharys, can't you see the truth?
Brother.
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't do this.
Don't do this.
No matter how he is, he is my uncle.
My real uncle.
I'll make him understand.
Uncle, you saw how many relatives I have now?
It won't make a difference if I have one uncle less.
Yes, uncle.
On one hand your final rites will be performed..
..and on the other my wedding ceremony.
Correct.
- But this wedding will surely take place.
Yes, so I will prepare for the wedding.
- Yes.

Someone stop me.
By the way, Prem..
- Yes?
Have you come here to show the necklace..
..your family has bought for her or to see Sanjana?
I had come to congratulate all of you.
This is the first love marriage taking place in your family.
Aryan.
You came from the hospital on the right day.
Come, I'll introduce you to Sanjana's future husband.
Don't you want to get ready?
- Ready?
Come on, go.
Go.
-I am ever ready.
Ask Sanjana.
Prem, look who is here.
He is the one.
He is the one who hit me with his car.
I went into coma because of him.
He was the one who eloped with Sanjana.
Look, Veer, Yuvraj.
Sanjana and Prem love each other.
That means everyone is a part of Prem's conspiracy.
I'll take care of you later, you wrenched woman.
We will first..
..take care of you.
You are flying too high.
Do you love to fly?
Yes, we do.
- What will you do?
Nothing, boys.
I'll just help you fulfil your dream.
YOU..
Where shall I keep it?
We will have to tell brother-in-law about his true identity.
Fools, not the true identity, but a false one.
Never underestimate three things in life.
I, me and myself.
Thank you.
No one can deport the one who has the family's support.
I am someone who can drown a fish.
What can you three.. do to me?
Go, Veer.
Go, Yuvraj.
I'll see how he stops you.
Let's go.
You are sleeping even after coming out of coma?
Do you remember your name?
Aryan.
- Aryan, go into flashback.
And see what I had done to you.
Where did he go?
- He left right in front of you.
Mr. Modi.
- Yes.
Mr. Modi.
- What happened?
We know the truth about that scoundrel Prem.
He is not Balli's nephew.
So?
- He isn't the real Modi either.
He is my real uncle.
A Kapoor.
Uncle.
- Yes, nephew.
Uncle.
- Uncle, catch them.
We'll see you.
- We'll see you.
Prem, I'll go with you.
- You handle the ladies inside.
I'm a Modi.
I'm a Modi.
I'm a Modi.
Aryan.
Aryan, let's go.
Save us.
Save us.
One.. two.. three.
The keys.
The keys are with me.
Come here..
Come here..
That way.
That way.
Side effects of too much rajma chawal (a rice dish).
Sorry.
O God!
Card.
Card.
- Thank you.
Call me.
No pee me.
Pee them.
Hey, stop peeing there.
Stop him.
Stop him.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go fast.
You are a dead man.
We won't spare you.
What's this new drama.
Bye-bye!
Amar.
Sanjana reminds me of our sister Shibani today.
Yes, brother.
Our Sanjana looks so happy.
I'm ready to go to the moon for her.
What?
Uncle, looking at her I feel that I won't even need..
..the almond flavoured milk.
Dad.
You know there is a that.
A custom.
Yes, but till date I've never got that of that custom.
A need.
You, too?
- Yes.
Stop this wedding.
Dear good people, someone stop them.
Aryan, you are back from the hospital.
But who did this to you?
That beguiler, Prem.
We have been cheated in such a big way.
Why did you do this to us?
Why?
Mr. Chaudhary, this was Sanjana's mother's desire.
And there was a belief in her wish.
Her wish was that you two get Sanjana married..
..and give her your blessings.
And she believed that..
..you two brothers will unite because of this marriage.
That means you really made a fool out of us.
You cheated us with 500 crores.
That means he is not a Modi.
And they are your uncles.
Listen, you idiots.
That's what I've been telling you since so long.
But you didn't listen to me.
You didn't listen to me as well.
- Then tell them now.
No, you only tell them.
God sent you down here but He forgot to give you any brains.
You didn't change even after seeing the goodness in him?
But I have changed.
From now on I will be a true uncle to Prem.
Let me see who tries to touch my nephew.
Come on.
Coming.
Here you go.
You will touch my nephew.
No, I am here to give you a hand, sir.
- Okay.
Sir, being with them till date I have only washed cars.
Being with you, I am sure I will thrash a person or two.
Great.
Great.
- Come on, let's begin the thrashing.
We are the five good men..
..and you are the two evil uncles.
Hippo Amar Chaudhary, you will get crushed in their fight.
Come here.
Fools, what are you waiting for?
Shoot them all.
We have come to attend the wedding.
We support love and not hatred.
Prem has changed us.
By giving double the money.
Let's go, hired goons.
Traitors.
Prem, you continue.
It's inauspicious to stop that in the middle.
That..
The wedding vows.
- The wedding vows.
Come on.
Let's go.
Priest, hurry up.
Otherwise, my father and the rest of them will get thrashed.
Come.
Can I hold it?
Shall I start walking?
Come on, son.
Priest, please hurry up.
I'll shut down your World Bank.
Fast.
Fast.
I'm safe.
No.
This will be fine, Chaudhary.
This is too much.
Prem.
Prem, you can get another wife..
..but you won't get another father.
Today, for the first time a woman has said something sensible.
Go, Prem.
Prem, you won't get a better chance to remove your shirt.
Show your body.
- I won't.
Why?
- He has become fat.
Fat.
What shall I say?
Enjoyed it?
Mr. Chaudhary, I am here to form relations..
..and not to break bones.
Anyway, at our place we don't even look into..
..the eyes of senior citizens.
Raising a hand on them is a farfetched thing.
Hence, chill and relax, Mr. Chaudhary.
Chill and relax.
Saw that?
This is what is called good values.
But are miles away from it.
Yes, you only know the meaning of greed..
..selfishness and deception.
You didn't even bother about my mother, you deceased sister.
How low will you stoop for money?
My child is absolutely right.
On one hand this boy is making sacrifices for his future wife.
And on the other it's you guys..
..who since ages have been making your wives sacrifice.
I'm feeling ashamed..
..to call both of you my sons.
Shame on you.
Disgusting.
- Hey old man, have you lost your mind.
Father.
Get up, father.
- Father..
Don't you dare!
He is our father.
I will cut your hand if you even touch him.
And I will break your jaw if you misbehave with him.
He lied.
He cheated everyone.
And you are..
They aren't even Modis.
What difference does the name make, son?
A person is known for his deeds.
And then, when have we ever acted like Chaudharys?
We have instead demeaned the Chaudhary name.
They are the real Chaudharys.
No, we are very satisfied being Kapoors.
How can he be a Chaudhary?
He has made us fight.
Brother-in-law, we should take revenge from him.
Revenge for what?
We should seek revenge because he made us human?
We should seek revenge because..
..by changing relations he changed us.
We brothers have been enemies since ages.
But today when our father got hurt our hearts felt the pain.
Should we seek revenge for that?
We should learn from this family.
Just being a part of a family doesn't make you a dear one.
A member is a dear one when you accept him.
Sir.
Sorry.
Sir..
We hold our ears and say..
..that we will never act like goons again.
And we will never be greedy for money.
And one more thing, sir.
Mr. Modi, what is your original surname.
Kapoor.
Kapoor.
- Mr. Kapoor, please forgive us.
And accept us.
Let us be a part of this wedding along with our girl, please.
Madam.
- Chaudharys plus Kapoors equals to Chapoors.
Mrs. Chapoor.
Oh, my, Mrs. Chapoor.
Someone stop her.
Ready?
- Ready!
"In 12 months I'll express my love to you in different ways."
"Now I think I won't be able to survive.."
"..even for 12 minutes without you."
"I'll write you some poems.."
"..on 12th of January."
"I'll send you kohl on 12th of February."
"It will save my darling from all evil eyes."
"Come into my dreams on 12th of March."
"Come to my dreams and drive me crazy."
"On 12th of April.."
"..bring some stars for me."
"l will send you warmth in winter."
"l think I will come to your home by 12th of September."
"And on the 12th of October.."

"By 12th of November.."

"..by putting a stamp on this heart."

This is my other card.
I'm also a divorce lawyer.
I've dissolved more marriages than I've performed.

I know love is blind.
But marriage makes everyone see things clearly.
Do yöu see things clearly?
I'm still blind.
I've already married thrice.
I'm waiting to get married for the fourth time.
What kind of a man is he?

We don't want yöur card.
Sir.
Sir, at least take the card.

Look, brother, she was being forcefully to marry yöu.
And that's why..
- Forget it. I was being forced to marry her.
What?
- l had come to tell Khushi that I love Kiran.
But I didn't get a chance to talk.
I was hit with a stick on my head and I fell unconscious.
I won't spare yöu.
- Brother, no..
Stop it, Gaurav.
Stop it.
We should thank them.
- Yes.
We wouldn't be together if he wouldn't have helped Khushi elope.
Say thanks.
Kiran.

Hi.

Hurry up, the two of yöu.
Come here and get married.

He is here.
He is here.
He is here.
I'll set myself on fire.

This drama has been going on since last night.
Neither is he sleeping nor is he letting us sleep.
Whenever he dries a little he wets himself again with petrol.
Mr. Pathak, if yöu wish to set yöurself on fire..
.. please do so outside, in the garden.
Why are yöu burning our house with yöu?
- Quiet.
Yes, exactly.
yöu heard that?
yöu heard that?
After ruining my family he is talking about his house.

Stay away.
Brother, Khushi is not just yöur daughter but his friend as well.
Yes.
- Yes.
I'm sure she must have seen something special in Raju.
I'm sure the day yöu see them happy, yöu will forgive them.
That day will never come in my life.
And there are hardly any days left in my life.
Perhaps not even one.
Yes.
He is right.
He is right, right?
Then keep this aside.
I'll commit suicide.

I'll commit suicide.

I'll help yöu.
Does anyone have a lighter?
No, I don't have it.
This lighter..

Shame on yöu.
- Brother, I didn't..
Don't change the topic.
What were yöu saying?
I'll help yöu deep fry.
What are yöu doing?
Prem?
- What is this?
What are yöu doing?
What are yöu doing, Prem?
Prem?
Prem?
- Will Mr. Pathak's death affect anyone of yöu?
No.
- No.
- Will the world end?
What..
What..
What..
I will burn him down.
Okay.
I won't spare yöu. I won't spare yöu.
- Prem.
Prem.
yöu'll ruin everything.
- Prem.
Something has to be done about this boy.
Hello, Guru.
Hello.
- Come.
Come, Ram.
Have a seat.
Have a seat.
Look, Ram..
- Yes?
Prem has done a good deed by uniting two lovers.
Guru, he ended brother and Mr. Pathak's age old friendship.
Yes.
- Prem that's the talks of his marriage even before it starts.
What is it called?
- Ends.
- He ends it.
Last month Guru sent a dog to yöur place, right?
Yes.
She is very nice.
- Yes.
She keeps everyone happy.
- Yes.
He sent two maids for household chores.
Naina and Sunaina.
They are very nice girls.
But cannot get Prem married to them.
- Right.
Right.
Similarly, Guru has found a bride for Prem.
Ram, listen to me. yöu know the Malhotras from America..
Yes.
- Their daughter is perfect for Prem.
Yes.
She is a Bandit Queen.
A Bandit Queen?
- A Bandit Queen?
Phoolan.
- Only her behavior.
She is very good at heart.
Her name is Pooja.
- Wonderful!
She is the only girl who can change Prem.
Guru, then why are yöu doing that in this?
Why are yöu delaying this?
- Why the delay?
She is coming to Bangkok tomorrow for her friend's wedding.
It will be great if Prem likes her.
Whether Prem likes her or not..
.. only Pooja will come to our house as that.
What?
- A bride.
- A bride.
A bride.
- Yes.
Hello.
- Karan, I've been trying all six numbers of yöurs since so long.
Tell me what happened to the wedding.
I ran away from the wedding.
But my passport is with them.
What?
It'll take at least 10-15 days to make a new passport.
But what will I do in the meanwhile?
They will find me.
I'll call yöu later.
- Hello!
Hello!
Hi, Pooja.
Do yöu need a ride?
No, thank yöu.
Prem and his uncle are coming to fetch me.
Prem, Pooja is coming at Terminal 3..
.. why are we standing at Terminal 7?
That's the game plan.
- Why are yöu throwing it?
How will Pooja recognize us?
That's what I want.
She shouldn't recognize us.
Why
What are yöu doing?
What is this..
This.. is a proof for my father that we went to the airport..
.. but Pooja Malhotra didn't come here.
So we came here..
- Uncle, tell me one thing.
Neither yöu nor I have ever seen her.
Nor has anyone in the family has seen her.
Guru has sent an imported Pooja Malhotra from America..
.. so that she marries me and changes me?
- Correct.
Uncle, I need a very impish, roguish and talented wife.
Impish, roguish and talented?
But nowadays it's so difficult to find..
.. an impish, roguish and talented wife.
All of them are married.
I am there.
But what will tell our Guru?
Let the Guru's mother go to hell.
Does he have a sister?
- Yes.
Then we shall send both of them.
- Okay.
Both mother and sister will go to hell.
Prem.
Who called me Prem so hatefully?
What did yöu think?
I will wait for yöu at Terminal 3?
And yöu will click a photograph here..
, and fool father?
- Pooja.
How did yöu recognize us?
Not yöu, him.
Daddy had given his description when I was leaving America.
I scanned the entire airport.
He was the only rogue with an innocent face.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
What an image yöu have, Prem.
I'm proud of yöu.
Why are yöu in a wedding dress?
What did yöu think?
I'll come from America in a two-piece bikini?
It would've been better.
- Just shut up.
Come on!
Let's go.
Excuse me.
Don't take advantage of the situation.
And don't yöu dare touch me.
Let's go.
Wow. lmpish, roguish and talented.
I should have asked for something else, uncle.
What better could have yöu asked for?
Think about it.
A yöung and old imp at home.
And they will bet on who is more impish.
yöur aunt and she will get along well.
Truly. I'll bet on yöur girl.
They are here.
Pooja is here.
Pooja is here.
Brother, is she Pooja?
Or has he brought some other girl from her wedding?
yöu all must be surprised, right?
Seeing me dressed as a bride.
yöu see, a girl looks her best in a wedding dress.
So, I told myself, "Pooja, don't take a chance."
"lf yöu want to impress everyone.."
".. then go dressed as a bride.
- Very impressed."
Impish.
Okay, tell me, how did yöu like our Prem?
Yes.
How did yöu like yöu?
I liked all of yöu a lot.
Very talented.
And if all of yöu support me then..
.. we will change him for good as well.
Talented also.
- Okay.
Then all of us are with yöu.
Come in.
Come in.
Come in.
- Come in, dear.
She will change him for good.
She didn't bring any bags with her.
What was the need to bring any luggage?
I'm not staying in a hotel.
I'm staying with my in-laws.
There is anything lacking in here?
Yes, only that like yöu was lacking.
That..
What?
- What do yöu call a son's that?
Daughter-in-law.
- We were only lacking a daughter-in-law..
.. and now yöur presence has changed that as well.
yöur father has become that.
- Mad?
Should I tell yöur father?
yöu are saying such things about my elder brother?
Yes?
Tell us, when are yöu going for the wedding?
I just ran from a wedding.
yöu ran away from it?
But yöu were going to Phuket for yöur friend's wedding, right?
Yes, I was going to.
What do yöu mean, "l was going to?"
If yöu didn't go there then how did yöu ran away from it?
By ran away I mean I got rid of it with great difficulty.
Why would I unnecessarily waste my time in Phuket?
That's right.
Why waste time in Phuket?
If I would attend my friend's wedding..
.. then how would I make arrangements for my wedding?
And I have to fulfil the responsibility Guru has given me.
She will marry yöu.
She is wishful-serpent.
I will never let her wish come true.
Sir, Pooja's on the line.
Pooja?
- Pooja?
It's for Pooja.
Give it to me.
Hello.
Hi.
How are yöu?
I'm standing at the airport since the last two hours..
.. and yöu are asking how are yöu?
I'm not okay, understand?
My friend.
The one who is getting married.
She is very angry.
Anyway, look, I am waiting at the airport, come on.
And he didn't come to pick me up.
- Didn't get the time.
I have come here from America and he didn't get the time?
If yöu don't believe me then talk to Prem's dad.
I?
- Dad, she is calling all of yöu.
Tell her that yöu all are not free.
- Yes.
Look, we cannot come.
We don't have that.
Tell her that we don't have a car.
- No, we have a car.
The thing that moves like this.
Pendulum.
- We don't have a pendulum.
Excuse me?
- Time.
No, we don't have time.
Sorry.
Heard that?
Now do yöu believe me?
If yöu don't have time then even I am not stupid..
.. to waste my time for yöu over here.
I'm going to attend my friend's wedding.
And I'll go to Guru's ashram after 8-10 days.
If yöu finally have the time and yöu wish to meet me..
.. then yöu can come there.
Understand?
Okay.
That's a great idea.
Bye.
Come, Pooja, I'll take yöu to the guestroom.
Aunt, am I a guest that I'll stay in the guest room?
I'll stay in Prem's room.
In Prem's room?
- Before this?
Before marriage?
Until we get married, Prem will stay in the guestroom.
Yes.
Don't worry about him.
He can also sleep on a table.
Look, he is sleeping.
Ma'am, if yöu want to stay then stay in the guestroom..
.. otherwise, I'll make yöu disappear in such a way..
Prem.
- Daddy, my room..
Uncle, cool down.
Now I am here. I'll handle it.
Now look here, my future husband.
For now, I have just snatched yöur room.
After that I'll snatch yöur sleep and peace of mind as well.
I'll make yöu empty.
Empty.
yöu..
- No abusing.
Come, aunt.
Show me my room.
Go.
Go.
Show it to her.
- l'll be right back.
Brother, she will set him straight.
Isn't she very delicate?
- She is a lizard.
A lizard.
I don't know where that girl is.
I'm telling the truth.
yöu lost her.
My men couldn't find her.
Where did she go?
She doesn't know anyone in the city.
And no one knows her.
Where can she go?
Where can she go?
Where?
Where?
Hit him.
I want her at any cost before Suraj Chaudhary to her.
Someone stop me.
She is one piece from head to toe.
How do I cut her into pieces?
Prem, control yöur mind.
I'll control my mind but..
This girl with a face that looks a mix of banana and mango..
If yöu scream this Rampuri dagger will take to straight to Lord Rama.
yöu are taking advantage of the situation.
Situation?
Advantage?
Again?
She will yak and force someone..
.. to think about it even if he isn't in the mood.
But what will yöu gain by killing me?
The CEO of fools, I won't benefit from it, yöu will.
I'll double yöur value.
- What?
How much is a live chicken worth?
- Rs.100.
And how much is a Tandoori chicken worth?
- 200.
So doesn't that double the value after death?
yöu will snatch my peace of mind?
yöu will snatch my room?
If yöu don't leave by tomorrow morning..
.. then I swear by Baba Rampuri..
.. I will kill yöu.
What happened?
- What happened, dear?
What happened?
- What happened?
What happened?
She must have had a nightmare.
She must have screamed.
A lot can happen in a nightmare.
Like..
Yes, a sneeze.
I was dreaming?
- Look, she is agreeing.
Come on, go back to sleep.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- She was dreaming.
Let us know if yöu need anything.
- Let's go.
Okay, goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Never underestimate three things in life.
Shucks..
Me, me and me.
Now yöu only bloody decide whether..
.. yöu have to come to this house in a palanquin..
.. or yöu want to leave this house.. as a dead person.
"Oh, Lord of the whole universe."
"Mighty Lord of the whole universe."
"All Thy devotees' agonies.. "
"All Thy devotees' sorrows.. "
"lnstantly Thou banish."
"Oh, Lord of the whole universe."
Great.
I feel I am going to have a great day in office.
After all my day began with such a nice prayer.
yöu have been named aptly.
We are feeling as if we are in Hardiwar.
- Yes.
We have got such a nice daughter-in-law.
Dear, yöu are so cultured and yöu have such good values..
.. in spite of living in America.
Bush taught Obama and Obama taught her.
So who is her mother is in America?
Obama?
Listen..
To celebrate Pooja arrival we will distribute that in the office.
That..
- Tennis ball?
No, not that.
- Paperweight.
'Ladoo' (Indian sweet).
Right, brother?
Yes. 'Ladoos'.
We will distribute 'Ladoo'.
We will distribute 'Ladoos'.
Yes, they are round as well.
The world is also round.
Should we distribute that?
- No, no, no.
What kind of people there are in the world, uncle.
Of different types.
They neither pray in the morning nor go to work.
Yes.
- True, dear.
There are such people as well.
What times have come!
There's a demon staying in a God's house.
I'll have to use my demonic mind.
Uncle.
- What happened?
What happened?
What happened?
- Nothing. lt's a small injury.
Should I seek revenge?
Here yöu go.
Mother Earth.
Bad mummy.
Bad mummy, Mother Earth.
- Sorry, uncle.
He was trying to make me fall but yöu fell instead.
But why was he trying to make yöu fall?
Anger. I said a few true things and he got angry.
He got irritated.
Why get irritated with it?
She is telling the truth.
He is always either on his bike or his skates.
Otherwise he keeps building his body in the spare time.
Why are yöu ruining my healthy body?
Everyone is saying something or the other..
.. don't yöu have to say something?
God sent him here to increase the burden on earth.
yöu are telling the truth for the first time.
We have been given a life..
.. only so that he can disgrace us.
Absolutely right.
- He is a big disgrace.
yöu have a great sense of honour, uncle.
Even a Satan will look like a God in front of him.
Great.
- Wonderful.
He is..
- l think I'll have to tell aunt about yöur affair, uncle.
I'm not saying it from my heart.
Don't take it to yöur heart.
My hand broke.
- Be careful.
Be careful.
Be careful.
Take me to a hospital.
- We'll have to do something about her.
She's digging a grave for yöu.
What happened?
- l cannot move it.
I'll handle her.
Because uncle, once she is gone, life is fun.
Great, Pooja.
Great.
- Enough.
It is delicious.
- Fantastic.
- She cooks so well.
- Yes.
Outstanding.
Outstanding.
Yes.
- And she sings so well.
- Yes.
And she is also changing our spoilt brat for good.
- Yes.
Look, he is here.
Son, yöur name is Prem (love) and not 'Hatred'.
Right?
- Really?
Hey, listen.
Hello.
- Sit.
Madam, go.
Go to the airport.
Come on.
Why?
- yöur father has sent a parcel for yöu.
From USA.
- Yes, so why are yöu giving me the news?
yöu should have collected it for me.
He is useless.
yöu sing so well. yöu cook so well.
What would have happened if yöu had studied a little as well?
The officer there won't give the parcel to me without yöur signature.
yöu only will have to go there.
How will the poor girl go to airport alone?
yöu go with her, Prem.
Am I her driver, chauffer or servant?
Brother.
- Prem, yöu go with her.
Daddy, yöu are very that.
- l am very boring.
But still, yöu will go.
Go, dear.
Go.
Yes, but dad didn't inform me over the phone.
Oh, fax.
- What?
He has sent a fax, yöu dirty mind.
Why are yöu fasting time talking, Prem?
The parcel will go back.
Come on, leave.
Go.
Please go, son.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Be careful. I think he's up to something.
I have a mobile. I'll call if anything happens.
Only if he will let yöu call.
'l could've easily spent 10-12 days in this house..'
'..if he wouldn't have been born here.'
'She has made my family crazy about her in two days.' 'l would be dead if she would stay for 12 days.'
'He cannot stop taking advantage.'
'We take advantage of those we would gain something from.' 'l am just trying to get rid of her.'
'Airport is on the left and he is taking a right turn.' 'ls he planning to take me to the jungle and..'
'No, madam. lf l do any such thing..'
'..then I'll get stuck with yöu forever.'
'Then I will have to marry yöu.'
'Then why is he taking me to a jungle?
'
'Will he leave me amidst wild animals?
' 'l would have if I wasn't so concerned about the poor animals.' 'l think I'll have to show her a few lions.'
How can yöu even think of such a thing?
What are yöu doing?
Where are the keys?
- l threw it.
The steering wheel got locked.
Why did yöu throw it?
Are yöu a woman or what?
I'm a woman.
- lf yöu are a woman..
..then yöu should have kept the keys here, like a woman.
Keys are not kept there.
Keys are kept around the waist.
To hell with yöur 26" waist.
I can see a six and a half foot grave there.
Move the steering wheel.
No, steering wheel has failed.
The steering wheel has failed.
yöur mind has failed.
But the brakes didn't fail, right?
- No, they didn't.
Prem.
- She's gone.
- Prem.
Prem.
Where are yöu?
- l am here.
Down here.
She was hanging me, now God has hanged her.
Are yöu dead or alive?
I'm still alive, but I can die anytime.
Help me.
- Okay.
Take this.
Take my hand.
Give me yöur hand.
Give me yöur hand.
Give me yöur hand.
Come closer first.
No, I am thinking that it's better..
..if one person dies rather than two.
Coward.
Dastard.
Pansy.
Chicken.
Should I come there to help yöu so that yöu can help me?
Let me ask help for myself first.
Hurry up.
- Help me, God.
Give me yöur leg.
- yöu are already hanging.
How else should I hang yöu?
I mean give me yöur leg.
Leg?
Man and woman look good in pair.
But to touch something with ones' leg is a grave sin.
yöu are hanging on the branch with both yöur hands.
How will yöu save me?
Ma'am, each hand of mine has 2 times a gorilla's strength.
Depending on age and size.
By the way, I can save yöu with one hand.
Then Useless, use that hand.
Hold my waist and pull me.
No, no, no.
Not the waist.
Then yöu will say that I took advantage.
What?
- By the way yöur waist is..
Let my waist go to hell.
Hold whatever yöu want.
Do whatever yöu want.
But please save me.
In that case, come to me, my suitcase.
Look madam, yöu are taking advantage of my disadvantage.
- What?
If yöu come any closer, then I swear..
..I'll let go of both the hands and embrace yöu.
And both of us will be dead.
Please save me.
Let's go.
What are yöu doing?
Just hanging around.
Don't worry.
yöu women are amazing.
yöu cannot stick on to anything other than yöur age.
Sometimes yöu say take the advantage..
..sometimes yöu say don't take advantage.
What nonsense is this?
All yöur yakking is making me go crazy.
It was the demand of the situation.
I wasn't wrong to touch yöu now.
I was wrong to touch yöu earlier.
If this is not wrong then why is that wrong?
And if that is wrong then why isn't this wrong?
Actually, yöu are wrong.
It is wrong to sit here and talk to yöu.
It's of no use. I'll lie down.
Obviously it's of no use. I'm sitting and yöu are lying down.
It would've benefited if either ..
.. both of us were sitting or lying down.
Look, don't say double meaning things to me.
This is a limit to illiteracy.
Where is a double meaning in it?
Look, don't turn and sleep like this. I feel something inside.
By the way, the jean fits well..
..on yöur waist.
My ill-fate I wish he wasn't a man.
And yöu weren't a woman.
Sanjana Singh.
Pooja has horns.
Prem!
'Prem.
Prem.
Prem.' lsn't it a great place?
yöu call out once and it echoes back a number of times.
yöu have brought me here to hear this?
Oh, no.
This is nothing.
Now I'll shout yöur name and see what name echoes back.
Should I?
Sanjana!
'Sanjana.
Sanjana.
Sanjana.'
Hear it.
'Sanjana.
Sanjana.
Sanjana.' l'm saying Pooja and it is echoing back as Sanjana.
Isn't it a strange place?
Look, the valley is so deep.
Prem.
- Only echoes come back from here, not people.
Tell me the truth.
Who are yöu?
Otherwise, I'll let go of yöu.
I'll tell yöu the truth.
Pull be back first.
Come on, start yöur story.
yöu already know my real name.
Sanjana Singh.
Actually, I had come from America to get married.
But the guy I was going to get married to..
..turned out to be a famous don's son.
I ran away from the wedding but they snatched my passport.
It takes at least 10-12 days to make a new passport.
I needed a place to hide as well.
Then I saw yöu at the airport.
yöu had come to pick up Pooja and no one knew Pooja.
So I thought..
yöu know the rest.
- l know the rest.
What did yöu do with the real Pooja?
I hope yöu didn't murder her.
No.
She has gone to attend her friend's wedding, in Phuket.
She will go to Guru's ashram from there.
Guru.
Guru.
Guru.
He is a..
Let's go.
Prem.
Hey, move aside.
"My heart broke."
"My heart went crazy."
I think yöu want me..
..to give yöu a lift.
yöu are very handsome and dashing..
..brother.
- Brother?
This car won't go anywhere.
It has broken-down.
Why?
What happened, darling?
Darling?
- The car will run.
It will get repaired.
I'm a mechanic.
It's my job.
Hope in.
Yes.
- But yöu didn't ask me where yöu should drop me.
I haven't caught yöu as yet, to drop yöu.
First let me introduce myself.
I'm Mr. Lehri.
I'm sure yöu know Bhappi Lehri.
There is no connection between us.
Yes, there is a connection.
He likes gold and I like to sleep.
Hello.
Why are yöu whistling?
yöu've already won over me.
Are yöu from Pataya?
Who is he?
is he yöur boyfriend?
No, he is a distant friend.
- A distant friend?
Just like a distant relative.
Okay.
Then I have no problem..
..because I am shortsighted.
So shall we leave, Mr. Weak?
Hello.
I keep a person like yöu as my driver.
Really?
- Yes.
- Then give me the keys.
Come on.
The key is in its place.
I got a driver.
Come on, darling.
Come behind.
Come on.
Come on.
Watch yöur feet.
yöu aren't in the mood to come behind?
Not a problem.
We'll talk from here.
Great. lt's such a yöung and beautiful weather.
When I look at yöu I remember a romantic phrase.
Tell me.
Mingle in jungle.
I, too, remember a phrase when I see yöu.
A.K. Hangal in the jungle.
yöu know liquor and beauty have a deep connection?
I'm often intoxicated and the evening passes away.
There will be a day when the evening will be intoxicated..
..and yöu will pass away.
Hello. I'm not here to get insulted.
Where do yöu usually go to get insulted?
Where will I go?
I stay at home. I'm married.
yöu give a lift to a single girl even when yöu are married?
Who doesn't?
I only give, yöu take it as well, forcefully.
Watch out!
What is he doing up there?
Plucking fruits.
He plucked a lot of fruits.
Oh no!
- What have yöu done?
I didn't do it. yöu did it.
Hard work paid off, didn't it?
yöu were driving very passionately.
Whose car is this?
- This is my car.
It's not a car. lt is my wife. I love it.
If yöur wife has an affair with someone..
..then who will work hard on her?
Her lover, who else?
Who will enjoy it?
- My wife, who else?
Who will get punished?
- Me, who else?
So just imagine.
She is yöur wife.
Who was working hard on her?
- yöu.
Who was enjoying it?
- She was.
Who will get punished?
Me, who else?
Because it was my car.
Don't cry, my son.
Be strong.
The Lord works in mysterious ways, my son.
Have this fruit.
yöu are a Father?
Father.
Father, I had bad thoughts about her.
Father, I'm a sinner.
I've committed a grave sin, Father.
I am a sinner.
Hey!
Stop the car.
There's the girl.
What have I done!
- Prem, let's go.
They are his men.
Come.
- Come on.
Come on.
Fast.
Or she'll escape.
- l want to confess.
Where is that girl?
- Which girl?
The one who was standing here with yöu. yöur sister.
She..
Sister?
I think she ran away with brother-in-law.
Listen, have yöu seen our boss?
Who is yöur boss?
- Tall, board, huge man.
Okay, this..
What are yöu asking?
I'm selling these fruits here.
The fruits of hard work.
These fruits are very tasty.
Just taste them.
No. I didn't.
My car hit him.
Get him.
- My car hit him.
Mr. Chaudhary, yöur son has gone into coma..
..because of excess blood loss.
I don't know when he will regain consciousness.
Quickly resuscitate him, Doctor..
..otherwise, I will sent yöu into coma.
Send me as well, sir.
To my home, sir.
Look, sir, it was my car but yöur son was hit by that boy.
I don't even now how to drive a car.
I swear on him.
Let him go.
Thank yöu, sir.
Thank yöu.
So sweet.
Yes.
Sir, I am leaving but before leaving..
..I would like to give yöu a small warning.
Sir, that boy is very smart.
He is fast, in driving cars and using his brain as well.
If he will come before yöu he will do such actions that..
..yöu will forget to give reactions.
Has anyone seen that boy?
I've only seen him from the left side.
And I've only seen him from the right side.
Sir, what is this left and right.
I've seen him from centre.
Will yöu be able to recognize him?
yöu are talking about recognizing?
Actually, I was born when I was small.
My mother was a woman.
And the person who murdered my father..
..underwent plastic surgery thrice.
Yet I recognized him.
Because he used to come to our shop to buy the plastic.
From now onwards, this plastic will always be with us.
Take him away.
- No.
This is wrong.
Shut up.
- This is wrong.
Find that boy and Sanjana.
Wherever they are hiding find them.
What?
- What kind of childishness is this, Pooja?
is this a way to behave?
Does anyone hold and push anyone like this?
How was that?
- What did yöu do?
Like this..
Like this..
What did yöu do?
- What did I do?
yöu held her like this and pushed her like this.
The push she got had that.
The push she got had minimal effect?
- Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
Take yöur position.

Welcome.
Welcome.
Come, come, one by one.
- Come on.
Come on.
Talk to yöur darling nephew.

From the time they have returned from the jungle..
..there is a lot of fun happening around.
"lt is fun. lt is fun. lt is fun."
Excuse me.
Just friends.
- Play the wedding tune.
Just friends.
Prem!
Prem, yöur method was wrong but yöur intentions were good.
Now I have no complaints against yöu.
- Mr. Pathak.
No.
No.
No.
My Khushi is so happy with Raju that I forgot all my sorrows.
Great.
Great.
Great.
- That's great.
yöu know I'm going to London.
Raju sent the tickets.
- Of economic class?
Yes.
- Yes.
How do yöu know that?
- Because I gave Raju the idea.
I told him not to buy first class tickets as yöu are such a miser..
..that yöu will be happy even with economic class ticket.
What happened?
- lt got wet.
- What?
What is this, Daddy?
yöu always say double meaning things.
There is no double meaning in it.
The thing which we talk.
With which..
Mobile.
Mobile.
Mobile.
- Mobile?
My purse.
- My money.
My purse.
yöur underwear.
Let's get out of this.
Today, I got that and after a long time that happened.
yöu got wet and fell in love?
No, I caught cold.
Today, the Sunday truly feels like a Sunday.
A Sunday will always be a Sunday.
- Yes.
We never go in the swimming pool together even if we want to, right?
Really.
- Thank yöu,Pooja.
- yöu're welcome.
Welcome.
Thank yöu. I am Ready.
But there is a No Entry here.
Someone stop me.
Sir.
A junior priest has come from Guru's place.
He is here?
- Yes.
Make him comfortable..
- Yes.
The junior priest is here.
I'll go meet him and welcome him.
My wallet..
From the drawer..
That one.
Yes.
And the wallet..
Priest, why are yöu here?
I mean what brings yöu here?
I'll tell that later, but Guru is very angry with yöu.
Why?
- Why didn't yöu go to pick up Pooja from the airport?
I had gone there..
..but I got a little late.
She left to attend the wedding.
Yes, she will be going to the ashram directly from the wedding.
Be there on time to pick her up.
- As yöu say.
Where is everyone else?
- They are with Pooja..
But Pooja is..
- Not this one, the Pooja which was sent last month.
We sent a dog last month..
- Don't call her a dog.
The family members have named her Pooja.
They have named her Pooja?
A dog..
- Again yöu are calling her a dog.
Doggie, dog, puppy, pup, Raju, Tommy.
Nothing.
Call her Pooja.
Otherwise with a broom..
They are so madly in love with her that nowadays we eat dog food..
Dog..
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Pooja's food.
Pedigree and White Kennel.
So what should I call her?
Pooja?
Don't call her that if yöu want to lose yöur loincloth..
..and yöur honour.
Hello, Priest.
They are here to serve yöu.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Bless yöu.
Bless yöu.
Guru had kept a 'Satyanarayan' ritual..
- Very good.
He has sent the offering of that.
Sanjana..
As soon as they call for Pooja yöu come with the dog.
Tell me, where is Pooja.
She is here.
Pooja.
Now what do I tell yöu, Priest.
We have got very attached to Pooja in such a short span.
She is so sweet that as soon as she came, Prem..
She won everyone's heart.
'Oh God, what magic has this dog done in one month?
'
Our Pooja is as decent as she is beautiful.
'A decent dog?
'
'Have they lost their mind?
'
She is now our family member.
Does she bite?
What kind of a joke is that?
is she a suckling that she will bite?
She is of marriageable age.
It's a different thing if she starts biting after marriage.
Whether she bites, scratches or does anything else..
..we have decided that she'll be the daughter-in-law of our family.
'They will make a dog their daughter-in-law?
'
'A dog will be perfect for yöu, son.' 'yöu deserve this.'
What are yöu thinking about?
That is happening with Guru's permission.
'Dandiya', 'Garba' (Gujarati dance forms).
No, no, no.
That..
That..
That..
Yes.
The alliance.
- The alliance.
The alliance.
'l think they have gone absolutely crazy.'
'They didn't go to pick up the Pooja Guru had sent..'
'..from the airport.'
'They have named their dog Pooja..'
'..and they are getting him married to her.' 'l'll also go crazy if I stay here any longer.' l'll make a move.
Have lunch before yöu leave.
- Yes.
Pooja's favourite dishes have been made today.
'Oh, God.
They are feeding dog food to a priest?
'
Look, I.. yöu can have it.
I'm fasting today.
I'll make a move.
- Bye.
- Okay,Priest.
- Okay, Priest.
Who is this girl?
yöu don't recognize her?
yöu are strange.
She is our maid.
yöu had brought her here from the ashram.
'Look at that.
These lunatics think I am crazy.' 'l hope I really don't go crazy.'
Excuse me. I'll make a move.
Okay.
- Okay.
"Baby, I can see the sun rising in yöur eyes."
"Baby, every time I think of yöu, yöu make me smile."
"Baby, I'll be yöur every dream and yöu should know.."
"Baby, I'll never ever want to let yöu go."
"Love is the dawn of the slumber of life."
"Love is a very beautiful punishment."
"l have fallen in love."
"My prayers have been answered."
"Love is the dawn of the slumber of life."
"Love is a very beautiful punishment."

"My prayers have been answered."
"Come, let's go somewhere."
"Let's fly and go somewhere."
"Love is our sky."
"lt is as open as our desires."
"An untouched feeling touched me."
"Like there is intoxication in the sky."
"l'm in love."
"l have fallen in love."
"My prayers have been answered."
"l have fallen in love."
"My prayers have been answered."
"My path tells this to me."
"Why don't yöu stray a little?"
"Now this journey is unique."
"Please ask my destination.."
"..to look out for my path from the shore."
"lf yöu are with me.."
"..this journey is like a dream to me."
"My heart has been a bit troublesome."
"lt has given me some beautiful problems."
"l have fallen in love."
"My prayers have been answered."
"Baby, I can see the sun rising in yöur eyes."
"Baby, every time I think of yöu, yöu make me smile."

"Never even in my dreams had I ever thought.."
"..that the God of desires would give me so much."
"l kept walking in a carefree manner."
"l kept walking on my path."
"l didn't know that my heart will stop for yöu."
"l'm in love."
"l have fallen in love."
"My prayers have been answered."

"Baby."
Maids.
- Yes, brother.
Where is everybody gone?
Brother..
Gone ashram.
Meeting Guru.
And Pooja?
- Gone.. with them too.
Why, brother?
Heart beating fasting?
Brother, where are yöu running?
Come on, come on.
- Come.
This is Guru's that.
What is it called..
As..
Ashram.
We've come here to fix a wedding date for yöur marriage with Prem.
Yes.
Let's go.
yöu go ahead.
We'll come.
- Okay.
Pooja, it is believed that all wishes..
Come.
Which Pooja are yöu talking about, Ram?
Pooja has not returned from her friend's wedding.
Then who is the one who has been staying..
..in our house as Pooja since the past few days.
Who is the scoundrel yöu ran away with?
Kill his entire family.
How is that possible!
yöu want me, right?
I'm ready to come with yöu.
Let's go.
Come on.
Leave me.
Brother-in-law.
Sanjana is not here.
I knew that yöu would surely come.
And I, too, knew that yöu would say..
.."l knew that yöu would surely come."
Why should I come, huh?
Am I yöur boyfriend?
I love yöu?
- Saw?
yöu are agreeing to it.
No.
Really?
He's yöur uncle?
Yes.
Prem, how would I tell yöu that..
..these goons, mafias are my maternal uncles?
Great.
yöur family members are like Charles Shobraj and Ranja Billa?
I love these mafia people.
Stop joking, Prem.
yöu don't know how much my uncles hate each other
My mother's last wish was..
..that I get both my uncles' blessings at my wedding.
So that their enmity ends forever..
..and they become good human beings like they were, earlier.
But?
- The greed of attaining my property worth 200 crores..
..increased their enmity.
Each one of them wants me to marry his brother-in-law.
200 crores?
I can draw a cheque without deducting the TDS..
..and keep yöur uncles in my pocket.
But my dear, until there are obstacles in a love story..
..it is not called a love story.
What stories will we tell our children?
Look, a boyfriend gets scared of his girlfriend.
A girlfriend gets scared of a cockroach.
A cockroach gets scared of a mouse.
A mouse gets scared of a cat.
A cat gets scared of a dog.
And a dog gets scared of a man.
- And a man is scared of a woman.
- What?
Just like a villain..
gets scared of the hero.
Prem, let's go.
My uncle is here.
What now?
They will..
- Don't worry, dear.
Today, I'll predict yöur future.
yöu will get married to an innocent looking rogue.
That's me.
Now can I take some advantage?
By the way, the fitting of the Indian dress is very good.
"Ready..
I am ready for yöu.
Are yöu ready for me?"
"Are yöu ready for me?
Are yöu ready for me?"
"Are yöu ready for me?
I am ready for yöu."
Uncle, Yuvraj was forcefully..
I ran away from there.
Sit in the car.
They are drying out.
What should I do about this boy?
This boy is making me that.
That..
irritate?
- No, not irritate.
That..
This..
This..
Emotional?
- Emotional is like this.
This..
- So?
He is making me this.
This.
This..
Crazy.
- Crazy.
- Crazy.
He is making crazy.
Crazy.
Crazy.
He lied to me.
That girl is not this but that.
What..
- Not Sanjana, Pooja.
Pooja.
Yes.
Yes.
What yöu are thinking of doing is not so easy.
They are dangerous.
- Yes.
They are dons.
I would've said the same had I been in yöur place.
But.. what would've yöu done had yöu been in my place?
Why don't yöu make him understand?
What should I tell him?
All I know is that Sanjana is a very nice girl.
And right now, she must be in trouble.
She must be in big trouble.
That's true, sister-in-law.
But there is no solution to this problem.
I have such a solution that I'll make the lives of both the dons, hell.
They have a common CA, who has done BA.
And his name..
What was his name?
Sounds like bully.
- Idil (a south indian snack)?
Mulli (Raddish)?
Pulley.
- Talli (drunk)?
No, close.
Close.
Khuli (open)?
Khali?
Khali.
Balli.
Balidaan Bhardwaj.
Sakku, how many times will yöu call me?
I feel that yöu call me even when yöu dial a wrong number.
What do I do?
yöu have left the house with so much cash.
I'm feeling scared.
This isn't the first time I'm out with so much cash.
I do transactions worth millions, day and night.
All 500 and 1000 denomination bills..
..across the world knows Balidaan Bhardwaj.
Then?
- That's fine.
But what if a thief stabs yöu and robs yöu?
Sakku, are yöu concerned about me..
..or are yöu trying to kill me?
Hang up, Sakku.
I want two demands drafts made.
One of 30 lakhs and the other of 20 lakhs.
Take this.
My bag?
My bag!
Where did my bag go?
Where is my bag?
There was 50 lakhs in the bag.
Where did the bag go?
My bag.
My bag got stolen.
Have yöu seen a thief here?
- No.
yöu blind man, yöu didn't see the thief?
yöu didn't even see such a big bag?
I didn't see it. I'm not the owner of it.
yöu..
Have yöu seen yöur face?
It's so black that if shown on National Television..
..it will ward off evil from the entire country.
Sakku, what yöu said came true.
Sakku.
What happened?
Amar Chaudhary and Suraj Chaudhary's 50 lakhs got stolen.
What?
Don't do this.
Pack the bags.
It's time to leave the city.
Come on.
- Yes.
They are here.
Tell them I am not here.
I'll go and hide myself.
Mr. Bhardwaj.
Mr. Bhardwaj.
He has not only left this house but this world as well.
A trunk ran over him.
- Oh, no.
He got crushed.
Do yöu have anyone to look after yöu in this cruel world?
No.
By the way, I had brought this bag for him.
What will I do of this briefcase when he is no more?
Don't worry. I'll take care of both his belongings.
Okay?
Let's meet after his final rites.
Thank yöu.
Bring it here.
Where are yöu going?
yöu are alive, sir?
- Yes, I'm alive.
It's her hobby.
She kills her husband over everything.
Start wearing a wedding chain from tomorrow.
People get mistaken.
She is mine.
And.. this bag is also mine.
There are only 50 lakhs in it, right, sir?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
There are only 50 lakhs..
Just a minute.
How did yöu come to know that there are 50 lakhs in it?
Just be looking at the bundle of the notes..
..I can predict how many notes it contains.
How?
- l learnt this art from my master.
Mr. B. B., sir.
Bishan Singh Bedi?
- No, sir.
Then?
Balibhrambhat.
- No, no, sir.
Bichun Bhutia.
Goal.
No way, sir.
The one who has written this book.
Mr. Balidaan Bhardwaj.
Be careful, sir.
I've written a book?
When did I write this book?
Such a fat book?
yöu?
- Yes.
Look at this.
The Balidaan in front of Bhardwaj is me.
That's me.
This is a sign of a genius.
yöu wrote a book and yöu don't even remember.
Sir, this book is a missile and yöu are an example..
..for a newcomer like me.
I have come to this city to be yöur assistant, sir.
I see.
- l want to learn the ropes of this job with yöu.
I don't want any money either.
- Then my job is done.
I mean yöurjob is done.
- Thank yöu, sir.
I have only two clients.
Amar Chaudhary and Suraj Chaudhary.
Sir, they are mafias.
One is a mongoose.
And the other one is a snake.
If they get together then they are killer sharks.
But both of them are illiterates.
How many times during a year do yöu think..
..people like Chaudhary must be paying their taxes?
Sir, they must not even be paying the taxi fare.
Sir..
I make them pay tax every month.
Every month?
Again and again.
- Again and again.
12 times.
- 12 times.
Yes.
What do I do?
It is dirty but it is my business.
It is yöur business.
This is the only way to teach a lesson to those goons.
Sir, yöur name is Balidaan but yöu are making yöur clients sacrifice.
Now that yöu have joined me..
..everyone will be sacrificed..
with Prem (love).
Come with us.
Come with us.
- Why are yöu hitting me?
Hit him.
Stop.
Stop.
Don't hit me.
Stop.
Stop. I am yöur teacher, Amar Chaudhary.
Teacher?
yöu are a cheater, yöu scoundrel.
yöu give me a zero in the exams.
yöu gave the wrong answer.
What was the question?
Who is the president of India?
- Mrs. Prathiba Patil.
yöu had said that it was Abdul Kallam.
The president got changed.
It is my fault that the president got changed?
What do I have to do with when and where Alexander fought Porus?
Do I have to go there and dig their graves?
Hit him.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Well done. yöu are doing well, Amar Chaudhary.
Saw that?
That's why I named him after me.
Amar Chaudhary.
Hey, Amar Chaudhary!
yöu stinky insect of a dirty sewer?
Mother, yöu go inside.
- Stop barking, yöu dog.
And let him go.
Otherwise I'll poison yöur food and feed yöu.
Got it?
Hey, go.
Take him back with dignity.
Go.
Yes.
- Go.
Let's go, sir.
Grandpa, yöu are being abused under his pretext.
No, no. lt's not so.
yöu are like a father to my daughter-in-law.
yöu are God.
A born leech.
- What?
See that.
He is.
This Amar Chaudhary.
It's time for school.
Don't yöu have to go?
Father, should I get something for yöu?
Yes, daughter-in-law.
Get some tea for me.
Okay.
- Without sugar.
And without poison.
Have some sweets, Mr. Chaudhary.
I got the land for yöur liquor factory cleared.
And it hardly cost yöu anything.
Only 50 lakhs.
Balli.
- Yes.
Don't yöu know yöu cannot bring strangers in here?
Who is he?
- He's my nephew.
Nephew?
- Yes, look.
We look similar, don't we?
yöu mean when I am of yöur age I will look like yöu?
Forget about the wace, Mr. Chaudhary.
Talk about brains.
He is from America.
He will show yöur income so less..
..that yöu won't need to pay tax.
- Really?
yöu know the billionaire in America?
K.K. Modi.
He used to handle his account.
K. K. Modi?
- K. K. Modi?
Forget it.
Forget K. K. Modi.
Now that yöu are here yöu work for Mr. Chaudhary.
Handle his account.
Hire yöu nephew.
- Nephew!
Grandpa, it sounds like yöur business.
Ganja.
Balli.
- Yes?
yöu didn't teach yöur nephew how to salute?
Salute me.
What to get thrashed?
What did yöu say?
- No. I saw my horoscope in the morning.
Yes.
- ln it it's written that if I salute..
..anyone yöunger than me today..
..then he will get thrashed all day long.
But still if yöu want..
- No, no.
Let it be.
But I have read his horoscope.
Balli.
Come on.
- Let it be, today.
My nephew is with me.
So..
Balli.
Yes.
Now my hands feel warmer.
The apple of my eye.
My brave boy.
- Wild hippo, Amar Chaudhary.
Write 'Welcome' on yöur face.
yöu will look like a rotten doormat.
Anyway, yöur ponytail looks like a dead dog's tail.
Look at yöur grandpa.
It suits him so well.
Take this.
Stupid.
Go to school.
Yes, grandpa.
This is the first time mother has said the right thing.
The girls in my class tease me.
They said it looks like theirs.
With yöur permission can I chop it off?
Amar Chaudhary, yöu can have yöur neck cut but not yöur ponytail.
This is a warning, not advice.
We are samurais.
This is the identity of our family.
yöur l.D. proof.
It is a voter's card, pan card. yöur blood group.
A proof that yöu are his grandson and he is yöur grandpa.
Where did this boring old man come from?
Great grandpa.
I saw yöu.
Today my day will go well.
Concentrate on yöur studies.
Kids of yöur age have gone places.
People of yöur age as well..
..have gone places.
"Happy days are over."
"Now I'm surrounded with sadness."
What is this, Mr. Lehri?
What are yöu doing?
I'm having black coffee with Obama in the White House.
Can't yöu see?
I hit the brakes to give yöu a lift.
Now my shirt has turned into a mop.
All this happened because of me, right?
I'm feeling very guilty.
I love yöu too.
Now it is my duty to get yöu out of here.
I also want to leave.
Because if my children grow up they won't recognize me.
And my wife is so nave that the poor thing..
..might once again run away with someone.
No such thing will happen because I have a mind-blowing idea.
This is the boy with whom Sanjana ran away, sir.
He doesn't look like he is from our city.
I'll find him even if he is hiding underground.
Are yöu telling the truth?
Sir, if I am lying he should die immediately.
No, I take his oath and say that henceforth..
..that that boy was not him but someone else.
Sir.
- What happened?
Sir, someone has come to meet yöu.
Balli, yöu got the land cleared for Amar for his liquor factory?
I just got the land cleared for him.
But for yöu along with the land I also got..
..the license for the liquor factory cleared.
Lehri, go. yöu are free to go.
Mr. Chaudhary, I am leaving but before leaving..
..I would like to give yöu a warning.
Sir, this boy is very smart.
Only I know how he traps people.
yöu won't be able to anything to him..
..even if he comes and stands before yöu.
yöu do one thing.
yöu keep cleaning cars here till Sanjana's marriage.
Sir, what are yöu saying?
Sir, this is a crime. lt's a sin.
Mr. Chaudhary, yöu cannot do this.
Mr. Chaudhary can do anything.
He is Justice Chaudhary.
He provides justice to good people.
And he clears out the bad people.
Pick him and throw him out.
Balli, who is this boy?
He is a con.
C
- O
- N. Con.
He joined hands with that girl and fooled me.
Which animal have I left out?
- yöu dog, clean the car.
Mr. Chaudhary, isn't the boy useful?
Once I start working, there will be no income and no tax.
No income tax.
But Balli, how is this possible?
This boy will work for Amar as well as us.
He has a habit..
..of doing two things together.
yöu know K.K. Modi in America?
He used to also handle his yöunger brother B.K. Modi's account.
But what if he turns out to be bad?
Then yöu can behead my uncle.
Behead me?
- Saw?
He agrees to it.
The thumb impression on the file.
Take it.
Just a minute.
Uncle, I was casually checking yöur accounts.
There are a lot of discrepancies.
What?
- There must be a slight difference.
21.
- 21..
Balli.
There is a difference of Rs.21.
Rs.21, dear?
It's hardly a difference.
Just a minute, uncle.
yöu are his assistant, right?
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on, show me the accounts.
Uncle, I'll go and check the accounts properly.
Yes, yes.
Okay, dear.
Hey..
Persuade her.
- Consider it done.
Balli, yöu saw how my niece's education is benefiting me?
Prem, this is not the right situation to take advantage.
Really?
Then promise me that yöu will meet me tonight.
And yöu will let me take all the advantages.
- Prem.
yöu..
yöu okay?
- Yes. I was just joking.
Balli, why do yöu look as if yöu've seen a ghost?
Our future daughter-in-law is checking everything, right?
Yes. ln detail.
Come with me.
Come with me.
Let them work.
Saw that?
My future wife is no ordinary girl.
Yes, I just came to know.
She has taken after me deceased sister.
So, yöur sister was also like her?
Then the entire family..
What happened?
He is getting scared.
- He fears he might get caught.
Sanjana..
Sanjana is not my daughter.
She is more than a daughter to me, Prem.
Her happiness means everything to me.
But..
But yöu don't know her uncles.
They..
- l know.
They are rogues from the Neanderthal times.
Orthodox.
I am a modern age dog.
Latest.
When we will fight, I will eat them up.
"l am a dog and she is my partner."
"l tell the truth, when she came.."
"..there came a season to eat everyone up."
Stop it.
Look, aunt, everything will be fine.
I promise.
What were yöu doing inside?
All that cuddling and all?
Uncle, she fell over me.
Girls from affluent families..
Hello.
Girls from affluent families are like that.
Try to understand.
Whether she falls on yöu or yöu wall on her..
..our necks will get cut and fall down.
Uncle, yöu only asked me to persuade her.
I got persuaded.
yöu would've got exposed..
..if she would've opened the accounts.
This is the first time I have let a girl touch me and yöu..
No, no.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
yöu are my disciple.
Come on, get in.
Get in.
Let's go.
"ln 12 months I'll express my love to yöu in 12 different ways."
"Now I think I won't be able to survive.."
"..even for 12 minutes without yöu."
"When the winter season starts in January."
"We will switch on the heater of love."
"ln a blanket as small as February.."
"..we will play hide and seek."
"March will be a romantic month."
"We'll do something we have never done before."
"What if we aren't able to meet in April?"
"What will happen?
Find a solution."
"l'll get an internet connection so that I can chat with yöu."
"When the summer season starts in May.."
"..we will party at the poolside."
"We will take a long vacation in June."
"We will go to a hill station."
"When starts raining in July.."
"..
I'll yearn to embrace yöu."
"We will have a lot of fun in August."
"We will make some arrangements."
"l'll take yöu to London.
I'll give yöu a tour of Paris."
"l'll take yöu on a world tour."
"l feel that I'll be coming often to yöur house in September."
"We'll see the sunsets together in October."
"yöu can keep yöur head on my shoulders."
"By the time the wretch November comes.."
"..yöu would've already surrendered yöur heart."
"Things will get confirmed on 12th December."
"With the confirmation from our hearts."
"There will be no car or mare."
"l'll bring the wedding procession on foot."
"ln 12 months I'll express my love to yöu in 12 different ways."
"Now I think I won't be able to survive.."
"..even for 12 minutes without yöu."
Prem hasn't come as yet, dear.
Don't worry, aunt.
He will surely come.
Why don't yöu go and pay yöur respects..
..as yöu have come to the temple, Junior Chaudhary?
Tell me.
I prayed for a week before my exams.
He failed me.
- Then why have yöu come here?
I'm my grandpa's junior spy.
Whenever any female in the family goes out of the house..
..I keep an eye on them.
Whether they are going and meeting our enemies.
Aunt.
Go.
My child.
Bless yöu.
- That's enough.
Bless yöu.
Sister.
Someone stop them.
yöu are crying?
They are bound to cry.
These sisters-in-law love each other more than their own sister.
In spite of living in the same city we have met after ages.
Our men our fighting and we women are suffering.
I wonder when this will end.
Like I have united the aunts I will unite the uncles as well.
If I don't turn this family into a 'Hum Aapke Hain Kyon' family..
..then don't call me Prem.
Thank yöu.
Okay, so yöu are befriending our enemies..
..in the pretext of praying and worshiping?
Son, she isn't an enemy.
She is yöur grandaunt.
Amar, my child.
- Don't touch me, yöu old woman.
Scoundrel, if yöu say a word more..
..I'll feed yöu kerosene and light a match in front of yöur mouth.
Get out of here.
Forgive him, sister.
His grandfather has made him just like him.
I wonder when he will mend his ways.
Why are yöu laughing?
He will change, but I'm laughing..
..thinking of the way in which he will change.
Junior Chaudhary, the park is closed.
It's closed for others, not me.
Go and tell the manager, Amar Chaudhary is here.
The park will remain open.
Okay, sir.
- Okay, sir.
Come here, yöu animal.
Salute me.
The park should be closed now.
We have to go home.
yöu are refusing Amar Chaudhary?
Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
Come.
How dare yöu!
I won't spare yöu.
Who..
Who are yöu?
Badman.
Badman?
- Yes.
I'm here to turn a bad boy like yöu into a good boy.
yöu..
One kick and from Badman yöu will become a dead man.
Kick me.
Kick me.
Kick me.
Really?
Here yöu go.
Darn him.
I am sorry, bad-man.
Spare me.
Forgive me.
Okay.
From today, yöu'll be a good boy.
Yes, I will.
yöu won't bunk school.
- Okay.
yöu won't trouble yöur teachers.
yöu'll always respect yöur elders.
And yöu will cut yöur ponytail as well.
- Yes.
No, no.
This is not possible. lt is the identity of my family.
Shut up.
The kid has tired me.
First try to talk things out.
If they don't understand then kick them.
Great, Balli.
Great.
yöur nephew is one in a million.
Amar Chaudhary.
Why do yöu have bandana on yöur head?
It's the latest fashion, grandpa.
Okay.
Okay.
Fashion.
Come here, my tiger.
And hit on this jackal's head.
Bless me, uncle Balli.
What are yöu doing?
Respecting my elders, grandfather.
This is what Badman has taught us.
Who Badman?
- He is our new teacher, grandpa.
Teacher?
Grandpa, his new teacher is Prem.
Dear, now I feel he'll also bring my two scoundrels back on track.
Hello
Uncle, uncle Suraj is once again trying to get me married to Veer.
What?
- Yes.
But I want to marry yöur son, Yuvraj.
Yuvraj?
- Please, uncle.
Please, do something.
Please, quickly get me out of here.
Someone is coming.
Come on, get the cars out.
Load yöur guns.
Let there be bloodshed?
We will have to bring Sanjana at any cost by this evening.
What are yöu doing, Chaudhary..
Sir.
Uncle, tell them.
What yöu are doing is wrong.
yöu are going to kill yöur brother for 200 crores?
Whereas someone worth 500 crores is in uncle's pocket.
Who are yöu talking about?
Uncle, I'm talking about K.K Modi.
Yes.
K.K. Modi from America.
Tell them how much he is worth.
He is worth 5000-7000 crores.
And hear this. yöu know who has been given..
..the responsibility of getting his daughter Naina married?
Uncle.
Uncle, yöu couldn't see this gem of a person?
Whereas Naina desires a gem of a person.
They are such lovely people.
They are romantic.
They are going to kill their brothers.
Uncle, if I wouldn't have thought of this..
..then there would've been a bloodshed today.
Why don't yöu think?
No, the idea was on the way in my mind..
..but because of traffic..
Get this straight, Balli.
If we don't get this alliance then consider yöurself death.
Get out of here.
I took K.K. Modi's name just like that.
yöu added his daughter to the story.
yöu added the responsibility of her marriage.
yöu added all the spices.
Sir, yöu told me all this..
after having a few drinks.
I told yöu about people who don't exist?
They exist, sir.
Listen.
- Yes?
Some K.K. Modi has called five times since morning.
He told me to remind yöu that he is coming..
..to India on Friday to discuss his daughter's wedding.
And yes, he has asked to book some resort.
Don't forget.
How is this possible?
Sir, this means yöu either have MP or UP.
Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh?
MP means memory power.
- Okay.
Sir, in this illness the battery of memory conks off.
Or UP that is unbelievable power.
Unbelievable power.
- Yes, sir.
In this the characters yöu think about come in real life.
I don't believe this.
That's why it is called unbelievable power.
Now yöu have to decide whether..
..it's yöur effective thinking or defective disease.
Meanwhile, sir, yöu have thrown me out of the house.
Bye.
Taxi!
- No, Prem.
I said that as I was worried.
Please.
Okay.
- Don't leave me in such confusion.
Okay, sir.
Tell me what I should do next.
There is no option or resort to this.
Yes, the last resort is that yöu book a resort.
Okay.
They have come?
Limo.
Ballu.
Ballu.
Uncle, go and welcome Modi.
What a pleasant surprise.
Come here.
Come here.
Give yöur friend a hug.
yöu have become fit.
I think it is the result of sister-in-law Shakuntala's that.
Love.
- Her love.
How is sister-in-law Sakku?
I hope yöu didn't have any that on the way.
What is it..
No, no.
One has to take some that for one's child.
Some..
Trouble.
- Yes, trouble.
Let's go.
Mr. Modi.
- Mr. Modi.
Stop. ls this a way to ask for donations?
Mr. Modi, he is Mr. Chaudhary.
A very famous L in the city.
- Landlord?
- Landlord.
- Landlord.
Mr. Modi, welcome, welcome, welcome.
Welcome.
Uncle Modi.
Aunt Modi.
Balli works for us.
Okay, Balli knows yöu.
That means he is our that..
Guest.
- Guest.
Guest.
Call him tonight for..
- Drinks?
Dinner.
Dinner.
And that as well.
Let's go.
Why are yöu staring at them with yöur mouth open?
Have yöu seen them for the first time?
Anyone will give that reaction on seeing Mr. Modi.
Sir, if yöu are a mouse then he is a cat.
If yöu are a cat, he is a dog.
If yöu are a dog, he is a fox.
If yöu are a fox then he is a lion.
If yöu are lion then he is an elephant.
If yöu are an elephant then he is a dinosaur.
Dinosaur of business, sir.
For yöur own good, come on time for dinner.
Otherwise yöu are a donkey, sir.
Who is going anywhere?
I am here till night.
Yes.
- Yes.
Let's go.
What happened, uncle?
He met me with so much affection.
He gave me a hug as well.
But I couldn't recognize him.
is it an illness or my imagination?
Both.
- Both?
One personality is ill.
It is the imagination of the other personality.
The first and the second personality clashed..
..with each other and resulted in the third personality.
Spilt personality.
The fourth personality will be suicidal personality.
yöu will feel like committing suicide, uncle.
yöu are right.
- No.
I feel like committing suicide.
- No.
Yes.
- Don't do it, uncle.
- Why?
yöu won't remember that yöu have committed suicide, uncle.
So what should I do?
Uncle, now yöu have only one option left.
What?
- Believe that yöur personality with imagination is right.
yöu know him.
He is K.K. Modi.
- yöu recognize him.
I'll have to.
Otherwise, I'll commit suicide..
..and I won't even remember it.
So what's the use?
He is K.K. Modi.
Mr. Modi, we are not as rich as yöu are.
But we are well respected in the city.
Great.
- Yes, sir.
They are decent people.
Really?
- They have a lot of cars and are cultured as well.
So brother, tell us, how much loan do yöu want?
No, sister-in-law, I am..
Balli, tell them.
- What should I say?
Uncle, with yöur permission can I tell them?
- Yes, please.
Mr. Modi, he is his brother-in-law.
Yuvraj.
He has studied till the 8th grade.
The 8th grade.
Raise two more fingers.
Yes, the 8th grade.
He has studied till the 8th grade.
So?
He wants to marry yöur daughter.
- What?
Brother Ballu, yöu have brought such an alliance?
Have yöu seen their faces?
They look as if they have just come out of a jungle.
Right.
Will their daughter marry into this illiterate family?
The Modis.
They don't have any sense of that.
Fashion.
Nor do they know how to that.
- Talk.
To talk.
They look like that.
That..
Ape-men.
- Ape-men.
If yöu weren't my friend I would have done that.
Shot.
- Shot yöu.
Let's go..
- Sumitra.
- Sumitra.
Let's go.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- Okay.
yöu ruined their mood.
- Shut up.
Shut up.
yöu..
I'll blow yöur head with yöu, yöu scoundrel.
yöu fool, he isn't a scoundrel, yöu are.
Do yöu know who are yöu messing with?
yöu can only make scrabbled-eggs from an egg.
Mr. Modi can turn scrabbled-eggs back to an egg.
yöu have spoilt the whole game.
But it's okay.
Uncle is here.
He will think of something.
What will I think of?
I am totally confused.
Will yöu tell us what this is all about?
Why have yöu made us all wear sunglasses?
Excuse me for my language, grandpa.
But what do these Modis think of themselves?
They have kept three conditions for the wedding.
I told them that I won't be able to look into yöur eyes..
..after telling yöu those conditions.
And yöu won't be able to look at each other after hearing them.
He said, "Here, make them wear these sunglasses.."
"..and tell them the conditions."
Tell us.
Tell us, what their conditions are.
Basically the Modis have made..
..the tent of Chaudhary's lives stand on three sticks.
Condition No. 1.
They don't like the way yöu dress.
What are yöu doing?
They say that yöu look like a C-Grade movie's villain.
How dare they!
This..
This is what uncle said.
How dare they!
- Yes.
Yes.
The Chaudharys will never change..
..their dressing sense for their 500 crores.
- Yes.
500..
- Crores.
Okay.
Okay.
We will wear up-to-date suits.
Yes.
- Yes.
Yes.
What is their second condition?
Their family is a joint family like in the movie 'Hum Aapke Hain Kyon'.
They all live together.
So is our family like in the movie 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham'?
We stay separately?
They have never seen yöu out on a lunch or a picnic..
..with yöur daughters and daughters-in-law.
- Enough.
They are womenfolk.
This tradition has been going on since ages.
This is what uncle said as well.
- What?
That the Chaudharys will never change their tradition for 500 crores.
Yes.
- 500 crores.
Fine.
Fine.
Listen.
Listen.
Henceforth, we'll all be together.
Tell me the third condition.
If I tell yöu the third condition then.. yöur pants will tear.
Pants?
- l am saying this.
I am saying this.
He had said something else.
Tell me the condition.
yöu'll have to cut it.
- What?
yöu'll have to cut yöur ponytail.
- No.
Even uncle yelled and said no.
- Yes.
Yes.
But what can we do?
They hold the trump card of 500 crores.
500 crores. 500 crores.
Cut them, Amar.
yöu can always grow them back.
But yöu don't often get a harvest worth 500 crores.
Great.
Now yöu are looking that and that.
Bold and beautiful.
- Bold and the beautiful.
So tell us, brother.
What have yöu decided?
What have I..
What do yöu say, Ballu?
Should I do that?
Yes?
- Do it.
Now that yöu have found a diamond..
..better set it in the ring.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Fine, then I'll call my daughter and yöunger that tomorrow.
Brother.
- Brother.
Okay.
- Do yöu have relatives or brothers or something like that?
No.
He has an elder brother..
Name?
- Suraj Chaudhary.
In spite of having an elder brother..
..yöu have come alone to fix the alliance?
Where is he?
How can he come here?
We don't get along.
A house where brothers don't that..
- Get along.
Get long.
Will their daughter go there?
- The Modis.
The Modis.
What he means is that their timings don't match.
He is sometimes out and he is sometimes in.
These two brothers love each other a lot.
Like..
Lord Rama and Laxman.
- Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So call them tonight.
Match the..
Timings.
- Timing.
Yes.
Consider it to be our that..
- Condition.
- Yes.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Don't hit my uncle.
What was the need to say..
- Sister-in-law, please, help.
That I have an elder brother?
I said it because yöu have one.
yöu could have said that he is dead.
yöu are strange.
How could say that?
Till date yöu haven't been able to kill him.
So uncle, how will yöu kill him?
But we are dead now.
That old man will never listen to us.
Hey, when God gave uncle a head over his shoulders..
..he didn't give it for decoration.
He will think.
He will think of something.
He will bring yöur brother by his ears.
Shut up.
Suraj Chaudhary will behead me even if I talk about it.
And if he doesn't come here then I'll behead yöu.
What?
Hey, let us go in.
Move aside.
Side.
Side.
Side.
- Who are yöu?
Keep distance.
Horn please.
May the face of the one with ill-intentions in his heart go black!
Seize the whole place.
Take everyone's mobiles.
Disconnect their phone.
Hey, who are yöu?
In this manner..
This is how we enter.
yöu have all the right to remain silent..
..as this is a raid.
I pay income tax thirteen times a year.
Yet there is a raid?
Sir, Ms. Sanjana.
Hello, uncle Mathur.
Hello, dear.
How are yöu?
Sanjana, yöu know these income-tax guys?
Aunt, they are not from the income-tax department.
They are from the World Bank.
I have heard of Punjab Bank and Allahabad Bank.
What is a World Bank?
The one outside Punjab and Allahabad is called World Bank.
The father of all banks.
And the mother of all banks.
Uncle and aunt of all banks.
But, sir, what are yöu doing here?
Ms. Sanjana's father had taken a loan of 200 crores from our bank.
So?
- So he passed away before he could settle the loan.
So?
- He keeps on saying 'so'.
He will lose his mind when he will hear this.
So, we have seized all his property in America.
We have managed to get back 100 crores.
We still need to recover 100 crores.
But Sanjana doesn't hold any property here.
She came here to get married to me.
Fantastic.
After marriage a wife has equal right over the property.
Hence, according to law, we will recover 100 crores from yöu.
The bungalow itself must be worth 50-60 crores.
Come, let's go.
Let's go.
Mr. Lover, I knew that yöu would get this marriage canceled.
But what is this issue of 100 crores?
Should I tell yöu everything today itself?
What's the rush?
Where are yöu going?
yöu are here.
Polish them.
Balli, what kind of a law is this?
The law is according to the place.
Uncle, including this house and other things..
..yöu will manage to arrange 100 crores, right?
yöu, too, wouldn't want my deceased father..
..to owe a loan to anyone, right?
Listen, assistant.
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on, let's check the value of the property.
Okay.
- Again?
No.
Actually I have some work with him.
Not now.
Okay?
Fine.
We will begin once yöur work is done.
Okay, ma'am.
How much work will yöu do?
yöu will get tired.
yöu..
- Everyone is standing here.
It's written in the scriptures, uncle..
..the more yöu work the better it is.
This girl will put me on streets to beg.
Now I got it.
Why did he break the alliance with this girl..
..and formed an alliance with K.K. Modi.
He knows that this girl has a loan over her head.
Balli.
- Yes.
Instead of us, yöu got K.K. Modi's daughter..
..alliance fixed into Amar's family.
If he has ruined it, he will mend it.
How?
- How?
yöu know B.K. Modi.
- Who is B.K. Modi?
yöu only had said that K.K. Modi has a yöunger brother.
Yes.
Yes.
He does.
He does.
K.K. Modi has a yöunger brother.
But what about him?
- His money.
What about his money?
yöu only had said..
That he is richer..
..than his elder brother when it comes to money.
- What?
Yes.
Yes. I said so.
But what about him?
- His daughter.
Daughter.
- Daughter.
His daughter's..
mother will also be there.
What about his daughter?
yöu had taken the responsibility of getting her married.
Wow, Balli.
No matter what yöu say that's a great condition.
Not condition, connection.
- Whatever.
But tell him Mr. Modi's conditions.
Yes, ma'am.
Coming.
I'll go and check the property.
I'll see how much worth it is.
Darling Balli, what conditions do these Modis have?
"Forgot tradition and became ready."
"lf they get it right they will make it big."
"Money can make yöu do anything."
Amar!
- Brother!
Brother!
Where is yöur party?
Has gone to pickup yöur party at the airport.
Where did she come from?
Did yöu call her?
It feels very nice to see the two of yöu together today, uncle.
Now my problem is also over.
Now both of yöu decide who I should marry.
Dear, yöu should forget Veer.
Last night yöur mother visited me in my dreams.
And she said, "Veer isn't good enough for my Sanjana."
So the confusion is over. I will get married to Yuvraj.
No, no, no, no, no, dear.
Yuvraj is absolutely useless.
yöur mother visited me in my dreams as well.
She started crying.
She said, "Brother, don't ruin my Sanjana's life.
More tears.
What about me?
Will I stay single all my life?
- Not at all, dear.
We, yöur uncles are there for yöu.
We will find someone good enough for yöu.
Nice, capable and decent.
We will have a grand wedding for yöu.
Why do yöu worry, dear?
We are there for yöu.
- Yes.
Okay, uncle.
Whatever yöu feel is right.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Meet him.
He's my yöunger brother..
B.K..
- B.K. Modi.
Yes.
Modi.
- Look who it is.
Ballu.
How are yöu, Ballu?
Hi, B.K. How are yöu?
- yöu look fit.
I think sister-in-law's love has played its trick.
How is sister-in-law, Sakku?
She's absolutely fine.
She keeps talking about all of yöu.
How is B.K?
What is he doing these days?
- That's fine.
Mr. Modi, the girls didn't come with yöu?
To hell with the girls.
- What?
- What?
He means say hello to Naina and Sunaina.
Yes, they are the apple of their mothers' eyes.
Naina.
- Sunaina.
They both are great, aren't they?
Walk straight.
What are yöu thinking about, uncle?
What are yöu thinking about?
I couldn't recognize the other Modi as well.
Uncle, this means it's not an illness but an imagination.
yöu mean the character I think about, comes to life?
Yes. yöu have the power.
Otherwise, how is it possible, uncle.
What will we call a person with such imagination?
We cannot call him human.
yöu mean I am..
God?
Brahma.
The Creator.
The creator of the universe.
Balli.
Look..
How they address God. idiots.
He has regained consciousness.
Now we will have fun.
Mr. Chaudhary, he is out of coma, but he is unable to speak.
How can he not speak?
Son..
Tell me, who was he?
Speak up.
Tell me.
Who was he?
Tell me, son.
Try to speak.
Try.
Uncle, why is he pointing towards yöu?
Balli.
This means yöu..
No, sir. I cannot even put a comma to sentence.
How can I put him into coma?
Mr. Chaudhary, yöur son is still not out of coma.
His mind is spinning hence he is moving his finger here and there.
Look, now he is pointing towards him.
Mr. Chaudhary, yöur son's condition is so bad..
..that he might even point his finger towards yöu.
Oh, my.
The son is pointing towards his father.
Please go out.
The patient is getting hyper.
Doctor, make my son get well soon.
Because the day he will come out of coma..
..someone else will go into coma.
Let's go.
There are so many sorrows in this world. yöur sorrow is so less.
yöu aren't able to say anything..
..because of yöur unconscious state.
And he cannot say anything even when he is conscious.
So sad is this and how bad is that.
Continue.
Sir.
No, sir.
Madam..
- Move back. I don't care.
Please sir.
Sir, please.
- lt's not my problem..
..as to with whom Mr. Chaudhary..
..is having his breakfast and his lunch.
Mr. Chaudhary, I've been looking for yöu all over the city.
And yöu are having fun over here.
yöu are having parties.
I'm being pressurized by the bank.
I keep getting phone calls.
Tell me what yöu want to do.
Mr. Modi, yöu are here?
What a pleasant surprise.
Hello, sister-in-law.
- Hello, brother.
Sister-in-law, it seems like yöu have come here on a holiday.
No, brother.
Our daughters are getting that with the brothers-in-law.
They are getting married with the brothers-in-law.
Mr. Suraj.
- Yes.
yöur brother-in-law Veer was going to marry yöur niece, right?
No.
Niece?
Who is his niece?
Here she is.
Sanjana.
She is a very nice girl.
Why do yöu want to get related to us instead of her?
Actually, what happened was..
- For Sanjana's happiness.
Sanjana doesn't like Veer and that's why..
..Mr. Chaudhary cancelled the wedding.
Great people.
This is very that.
- Good.
- Good.
A very good thing.
But brother, it's wrong as well.
Look brother, there is a yöung unmarried girl in their family.
And they are getting their brothers-in-law married.
It is wrong, isn't it?
- True.
It is not so.
Mr. Chaudhary is looking for a suitable boy for her.
He will get her married as soon as he finds a suitable boy.
Take yöur time and find a boy.
We are here for four days.
Look, first Sanjana will get married then our daughters will.
But Mr. Modi..
- No ifs or buts.
Consider this to be our that.
- Condition.
- Our condition.
Yes.
- Another condition?
Don't worry.
All the four Chaudharys are charged.
They will do something in four days.
Great people.
People, everybody join me please.
"Whether yöu are a crescent or the moonlight."
"No matter what yöu are.."
"..
I swear on God, yöu are great."
Clap, everyone.
Great.
Brother, the Chaudharys might get a heart attack..
..listening to yöur conditions.
Brother has kept a condition of Sanjana's wedding.
- Yes.
But yöu'll have to give the idea that our Prem will be her groom.
This condition has been kept to give this idea.
Okay.
- But they are very dangerous people.
If they find out the truth..
There is one person who is very dangerous.
Lehri.
He is very smart.
But he has already said such a big lie..
..that now if he tells the truth, he will be the first one to die.
'Okay, so this is his family and not the Modi family.'
Mr. Balidaan.
The poor thing is standing as a statue.
Fine, I will bring it into life.
Brother.
Brother.
Brother.
I have come here to tell yöu a secret.
Here he is.
Here he is.
yöu are doing pushups?
No, I'm pushing the ground down.
Keep quiet.
Keep quiet.
Tell me, who am I?
Am I God?
Am I a human being?
Who am I?
yöu are the first God with has been made by this human being.
What not have yöu made me?
Now even I have forgotten who I am.
I have become the Aamir Khan in the movie 'Gajani'.
Look here.
Look at this.
yöu have no idea how difficult it is to write on yöur back!
Rascal.
yöu played such a big game with a genius like me..
..who has written such a famous book?
Give me the book, please.
Here yöu go, genius.
I won't let yöu win as long as I am alive.
What will I do?
Mr. Balli, Mr. Chaudhary is calling yöu.
Go. yöu have been summoned.
Yes.
Yes, I've put the ball in the hole.
I've learnt to play golf.
This is how we used to play marbles as well.
yöu are right.
- Greetings, sir.
Come.
Come, Mr. Balidaan.
Come.
- yöu summoned me?
We have known each other since ages.
Why don't we turn this acquaintance into a relationship?
I didn't get yöu.
yöur nephew Prem and our niece Sanjana.
Let's get them married.
- No.
No, this marriage cannot take place.
- Why not?
yöu are a servant.
We are yöur employer.
yöu don't like the respect we are giving yöu?
Why cannot this marriage take place, uncle?
We are their loyal servants.
We have to pay them back in someway or the other.
Right, uncle?
- Don't touch me.
yöu see, the girl has a loan of 100 crores over her head.
That too of the World Bank.
Who will pay it back?
yöu?
- We will pay it back.
We are going to get millions from the Modis.
yöu can keep 100-125 out of it.
Not 125, only 100 crores.
The amount of the loan.
After that even if yöu sent yöur daughter..
..without any clothes on, we will accept her.
Great.
Right, uncle?
We accept it, don't we?
- Yes.
Sanjana, my child..
I accept this match, uncle.
Uncle, yöur teeth will break if yöu will grind them so hard.
Mr. Chaudhary, there is a problem.
This Lehri keeps saying that Sanjana..
..had eloped with a boy during her wedding.
If someone comes to know about it on my wedding day..
..then my uncle will be defamed.
Can yöu please take care of this Lehri, sir?
Go and find Lehri.
- Get him here.
Yes, Mr. Chaudhary?
- Who eloped with Sanjana?
This..
What is this that yöu are asking me?
I had shown yöu the photograph.
A lie.
yöu are lying.
He had eloped with Sanjana.
yöu are right.
He had eloped with her.
Forgive me, I had lied.
He is the one I had given a lift to.
Henceforth, this is what yöu should tell everyone.
Got it?
Are yöu happy now, Prem?
Yes, Mr. Chaudhary.
Mr. Lehri, yöu don't know what a big favour..
..yöu have done to my uncle and the Chaudhary family.
God will surely send yöu to heaven.
Congratulations, Balli.
yöu became their that.
What is it?
Yes, their relative.
Mr. Modi, yöu are the one who gave us this idea.
Otherwise, how could we ever think of this?
Have this.
Why did yöu unnecessarily take the that.
Trouble.
yöu go and have yöur meal.
- We'll all have together.
No, we don't know how long we will take.
Why should yöu stay that because of us?
Hungry.
Go, have yöur meal.
- Okay.
I love yöu.
That's great, Mr. Modi.
At yöur place the women eat before the men do.
At our place, till we do eat, the women will die but..
..not touch the food.
This is wrong.
Look, women live in a very that world.
Small.
It begins from and ends at us.
The house and kids.
She is that in them.
What is it said?
Yes, restricted.
Hence it is our duty to look after them.
We should love them.
We should always keep them that.
We should keep them happy.
Radhika..
What happened?
Nothing. yöu have yöur meal.
Before yöu?
- So what?
If I drink all night along ill yöu stay hungry till the morning?
What is wrong with yöu, today?
Love.
I love yöu.
Sorry.
Shalu.
Shalu?
- Yes, Shalani.
Now I will always call yöu Shalu.
And henceforth, yöu can eat before me.
Why so?
- Because I love yöu.
Thank yöu.
Brother, Prem is nowhere to be seen.
Sanjana is not here either.
They got what they wanted.
The lovebirds must be busy at some corner.
Yes, so what is wrong in that?
They both that to each other.
They love each other.
They are going to get married.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Come, let's go and have some food.
Come on.
Look, Prem and Sanjana are also back.
Come on.
The bride and the groom are also here.
Let me make an announcement.
I have decided that this marriage won't take place.
What?
- What?
Once again uncle must have gone into the 100 crore loop..
..after having a little too much to drink.
Balli, what are yöu saying?
Keep quiet.
Keep quiet.
yöu are saying Balli and sacrificing me
This marriage won't take place.
If uncle doesn't want this marriage to take place then..
Without uncle, I don't want to marry like an orphan.
Since when did yöu become an orphan, yöu liar?
Here he is. yöur father is here in a three-piece suit.
He is here.
Fine.
Fine.
Fine, Ballu.
If yöu are breaking yöur that with him.
Then I will form a that with him.
What is it?
Yes, a relationship.
Henceforth, I am yöur father.
And I am yöur mother.
I'm yöur uncle.
I'm yöur aunt.
If yöu are falling short of relatives then I, too, shall become one?
Why..
Why would yöu become anyone?
yöu are his uncle.
Keep it fixed.
Then it is fixed.
- Yes.
Henceforth, I am his uncle.
- And I am his aunt.
Look at that.
They all are telling the truth.
Chaudharys, can't yöu see the truth?
Brother.
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't do this.
Don't do this.
No matter how he is, he is my uncle.
My real uncle. I'll make him understand.
Uncle, yöu saw how many relatives I have now?
It won't make a difference if I have one uncle less.
Yes, uncle.
On one hand yöur final rites will be performed..
..and on the other my wedding ceremony.
Correct.
- But this wedding will surely take place.
Yes, so I will prepare for the wedding.
- Yes.

Someone stop me.
By the way, Prem..
- Yes?
Have yöu come here to show the necklace..
..yöur family has bought for her or to see Sanjana?
I had come to congratulate all of yöu.
This is the first love marriage taking place in yöur family.
Aryan.
yöu came from the hospital on the right day.
Come, I'll introduce yöu to Sanjana's future husband.
Don't yöu want to get ready?
- Ready?
Come on, go.
Go.
- l am ever ready.
Ask Sanjana.
Prem, look who is here.
He is the one.
He is the one who hit me with his car.
I went into coma because of him.
He was the one who eloped with Sanjana.
Look, Veer, Yuvraj.
Sanjana and Prem love each other.
That means everyone is a part of Prem's conspiracy.
I'll take care of yöu later, yöu wrenched woman.
We will first..
..take care of yöu.
yöu are flying too high.
Do yöu love to fly?
Yes, we do.
- What will yöu do?
Nothing, boys. I'll just help yöu fulfil yöur dream.
yöu..
Where shall I keep it?
We will have to tell brother-in-law about his true identity.
Fools, not the true identity, but a false one.
Never underestimate three things in life.
I, me and myself.
Thank yöu.
No one can deport the one who has the family's support.
I am someone who can drown a fish.
What can yöu three.. do to me?
Go, Veer.
Go, Yuvraj.
I'll see how he stops yöu.
Let's go.
yöu are sleeping even after coming out of coma?
Do yöu remember yöur name?
Aryan.
- Aryan, go into flashback.
And see what I had done to yöu.
Where did he go?
- He left right in front of yöu.
Mr. Modi.
- Yes.
Mr. Modi.
- What happened?
We know the truth about that scoundrel Prem.
He is not Balli's nephew.
So?
- He isn't the real Modi either.
He is my real uncle.
A Kapoor.
Uncle.
- Yes, nephew.
Uncle.
- Uncle, catch them.
We'll see yöu.
- We'll see yöu.
Prem, I'll go with yöu.
- yöu handle the ladies inside.
I'm a Modi. I'm a Modi. I'm a Modi.
Aryan.
Aryan, let's go.
Save us.
Save us.
One.. two.. three.
The keys.
The keys are with me.
Come here..
Come here..
That way.
That way.
Side effects of too much rajma chawal (a rice dish).
Sorry.
O God!
Card.
Card.
- Thank yöu.
Call me.
No pee me.
Pee them.
Hey, stop peeing there.
Stop him.
Stop him.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go fast.
yöu are a dead man.
We won't spare yöu.
What's this new drama.
Bye-bye!
Amar.
Sanjana reminds me of our sister Shibani today.
Yes, brother.
Our Sanjana looks so happy.
I'm ready to go to the moon for her.
What?
Uncle, looking at her I feel that I won't even need..
..the almond flavoured milk.
Dad.
yöu know there is a that.
A custom.
Yes, but till date I've never got that of that custom.
A need.
yöu, too?
- Yes.
Stop this wedding.
Dear good people, someone stop them.
Aryan, yöu are back from the hospital.
But who did this to yöu?
That beguiler, Prem.
We have been cheated in such a big way.
Why did yöu do this to us?
Why?
Mr. Chaudhary, this was Sanjana's mother's desire.
And there was a belief in her wish.
Her wish was that yöu two get Sanjana married..
..and give her yöur blessings.
And she believed that..
..yöu two brothers will unite because of this marriage.
That means yöu really made a fool out of us.
yöu cheated us with 500 crores.
That means he is not a Modi.
And they are yöur uncles.
Listen, yöu idiots.
That's what I've been telling yöu since so long.
But yöu didn't listen to me.
yöu didn't listen to me as well.
- Then tell them now.
No, yöu only tell them.
God sent yöu down here but He forgot to give yöu any brains.
yöu didn't change even after seeing the goodness in him?
But I have changed.
From now on I will be a true uncle to Prem.
Let me see who tries to touch my nephew.
Come on.
Coming.
Here yöu go.
yöu will touch my nephew.
No, I am here to give yöu a hand, sir.
- Okay.
Sir, being with them till date I have only washed cars.
Being with yöu, I am sure I will thrash a person or two.
Great.
Great.
- Come on, let's begin the thrashing.
We are the five good men..
..and yöu are the two evil uncles.
Hippo Amar Chaudhary, yöu will get crushed in their fight.
Come here.
Fools, what are yöu waiting for?
Shoot them all.
We have come to attend the wedding.
We support love and not hatred.
Prem has changed us.
By giving double the money.
Let's go, hired goons.
Traitors.
Prem, yöu continue.
It's inauspicious to stop that in the middle.
That..
The wedding vows.
- The wedding vows.
Come on.
Let's go.
Priest, hurry up.
Otherwise, my father and the rest of them will get thrashed.
Come.
Can I hold it?
Shall I start walking?
Come on, son.
Priest, please hurry up.
I'll shut down yöur World Bank.
Fast.
Fast.
I'm safe.
No.
This will be fine, Choudhary.
This is too much.
Prem.
Prem, yöu can get another wife..
..but yöu won't get another father.
Today, for the first time a woman has said something sensible.
Go, Prem.
Prem, yöu won't get a better chance to remove yöur shirt.
Show yöur body.
- l won't.
Why?
- He has become fat.
Fat.
What shall I say?
Enjoyed it?
Mr. Chaudhary, I am here to form relations..
..and not to break bones.
Anyway, at our place we don't even look into..
..the eyes of senior citizens.
Raising a hand on them is a farfetched thing.
Hence, chill and relax, Mr. Chaudhary.
Chill and relax.
Saw that?
This is what is called good values.
But are miles away from it.
Yes, yöu only know the meaning of greed..
..selfishness and deception.
yöu didn't even bother about my mother, yöu deceased sister.
How low will yöu stoop for money?
My child is absolutely right.
On one hand this boy is making sacrifices for his future wife.
And on the other it's yöu guys..
..who since ages have been making yöur wives sacrifice.
I'm feeling ashamed..
..to call both of yöu my sons.
Shame on yöu.
Disgusting.
- Hey old man, have yöu lost yöur mind.
Father.
Get up, father.
- Father..
Don't yöu dare!
He is our father.
I will cut yöur hand if yöu even touch him.
And I will break yöurjaw if yöu misbehave with him.
He lied.
He cheated everyone.
And yöu are..
They aren't even Modis.
What difference does the name make, son?
A person is known for his deeds.
And then, when have we ever acted like Chaudharys?
We have instead demeaned the Chaudhary name.
They are the real Chaudharys.
No, we are very satisfied being Kapoors.
How can he be a Chaudhary?
He has made us fight.
Brother-in-law, we should take revenge from him.
Revenge for what?
We should seek revenge because he made us human?
We should seek revenge because..
..by changing relations he changed us.
We brothers have been enemies since ages.
But today when our father got hurt our hearts felt the pain.
Should we seek revenge for that?
We should learn from this family.
Just being a part of a family doesn't make yöu a dear one.
A member is a dear one when yöu accept him.
Sir.
Sorry.
Sir..
We hold our ears and say..
..that we will never act like goons again.
And we will never be greedy for money.
And one more thing, sir.
Mr. Modi, what is yöur original surname.
Kapoor.
Kapoor.
- Mr. Kapoor, please forgive us.
And accept us.
Let us be a part of this wedding along with our girl, please.
Madam.
- Chaudharys plus Kapoors equals to Chapoors.
Mrs. Chapoor.
Oh, my, Mrs. Chapoor.
Someone stop her.
Ready?
- Ready!

"I love you.
I love you.
I love you."
What is it?
You are dancing with joy.
Why?
- You didn't dance so much at our wedding.
I'm celebrating someone else's joy.
That was a suicide.
- Suicide?
My joy.
Does anyone dancing when he is happy?
Not suicide.
'That's Prem's uncle, Bharat Kapoor.'
'And his wife, Suman.'
Look, brothers, if there is that at that then that will happen.
What that and that will happen?
If there is lack of anything at the wedding..

Okay.
Don't worry, brother..

Gaurav had gone inside to meet Khushi for two minutes.
Half an hour has passed by.
Go and check what's happening.

Thank you. I was not in town.
If you wouldn't have helped her run away..

Yes.
And I would have become someone else's wife.
Not a chance.
Here's my card.
You are a registrar here.
We know.
No, no, no.
This is my other card.
I'm also a divorce lawyer.
I've dissolved more marriages than I've performed.
And looking at the two of you I feel..
.. that you will definitely need me in future.
I know love is blind.
But marriage makes everyone see things clearly.
Do you see things clearly?
I'm still blind.
I've already married thrice.
I'm waiting to get married for the fourth time.
What kind of a man is he?
- Thank you.
Let's go.
Let's go.
We don't want your card.
Sir.
Sir, at least take the card.
Sir..
Who is he?
- He was getting married to her.
Look, brother, she was being forcefully to marry you.
And that's why..
- Forget it. I was being forced to marry her.
What?
- l had come to tell Khushi that I love Kiran.
But I didn't get a chance to talk.
I was hit with a stick on my head and I fell unconscious.
I won't spare you.
- Brother, no..
Stop it, Gaurav.
Stop it.
We should thank them.
- Yes.
We wouldn't be together if he wouldn't have helped Khushi eIope.
Say thanks.
Kiran.
- Hi.
How are you?
Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
Hurry up, the two of you.
Come here and get married.
I have to go and get someone divorced.
Let's go.
It's time for our flight as well.
We'll make a move.
Thank you so much.

Oh, seating.
- Yes.
Okay.
You parking bike.
I'm seeing how much shitting.
He is here.
He is here.
He is here.
I'Il set myself on fire.
I'Il kill myself.
This drama has been going on since last night.
Neither is he sleeping nor is he letting us sleep.
Whenever he dries a little he wets himself again with petrol.
Mr. Pathak, if you wish to set yourself on fire..
.. please do so outside, in the garden.
Why are you burning our house with you?
- Quiet.
Yes, exactly.
You heard that?
You heard that?
After ruining my family he is talking about his house.
Daddy, why don't you dive and snatch it?
Shut up.
You have done that.
- A wrong thing.
A wrong thing.
Yes.
- Stay away.
Stay away.
Stay away.
I'Il set myself on fire.
Brother..
- Stay away.
Stay away.
Stay away.
Brother, Khushi is not just your daughter but his friend as weIl.
Yes.
- Yes.
I'm sure she must have seen something special in Raju.
I'm sure the day you see them happy, you will forgive them.
That day will never come in my life.
And there are hardly any days left in my life.
Perhaps not even one.
Yes.
He is right.
He is right, right?
Then keep this aside.
I'Il commit suicide.
- You..
I'Il commit suicide.
- Who are you threatening?
I'Il help you.
Does anyone have a lighter?
No, I don't have it.
This lighter..
- You started smoking?
- You started smoking?
Shame on you.
- Brother, I didn't..
Don't change the topic.
What were you saying?
I'Il help you deep fry.
What are you doing?
Prem?
- What is this?
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Prem?
Prem?
Prem?
- Will Mr. Pathak's death affect anyone of you?
No.

Okay.
I won't spare you. I won't spare you.

Something has to be done about this boy.
Hello, Guru.
Hello.
- Come.
Come, Ram.
Have a seat.
Have a seat.
Look, Ram..
- Yes?
Prem has done a good deed by uniting two lovers.
Guru, he ended brother and Mr. Pathak's age old friendship.
Yes.
- Prem that's the talks of his marriage even before it starts.
What is it called?
- Ends.
- He ends it.
Last month Guru sent a dog to your place, right?
Yes.
She is very nice.
- Yes.
She keeps everyone happy.
- Yes.
He sent two maids for household chores.
Naina and Sunaina.
They are very nice girls.
But cannot get Prem married to them.
- Right.
Right.
Similarly, Guru has found a bride for Prem.
Ram, listen to me.
You know the Malhotras from America..
Yes.
- Their daughter is perfect for Prem.
Yes.
She is a Bandit Queen.
A Bandit Queen?
- A Bandit Queen?
Phoolan.
- Only her behavior.
She is very good at heart.
Her name is Pooja.
- Wonderful!
She is the only girl who can change Prem.
Guru, then why are you doing that in this?
Why are you delaying this?
- Why the delay?
She is coming to Bangkok tomorrow for her friend's wedding.
It will be great if Prem likes her.
Whether Prem likes her or not..
.. only Pooja will come to our house as that.
What?
- A bride.
- A bride.
A bride.
- Yes.
Hello.
- Karan, I've been trying all six numbers of yours since so long.
tell me what happened to the wedding.
I ran away from the wedding.
But my passport is with them.
What?
It'Il take at least 10-15 days to make a new passport.
But what will I do in the meanwhile?
They will find me.
I'Il call you later.
- hello!
Hello!
Hi, Pooja.
Do you need a ride?
No, thank you.
Prem and his uncle are coming to fetch me.
Prem, Pooja is coming at Terminal 3..
.. why are we standing at terminal 7?
That's the game plan.
- Why are you throwing it?
How will Pooja recognize us?
That's what I want.
She shouldn't recognize us.
Why
What are you doing?
What is this..
This.. is a proof for my wather that we went to the airport..
.. but Pooja MaIhotra didn't come here.
So we came here..
- Uncle, tell me one thing.
Neither you nor I have ever seen her.
Nor has anyone in the family has seen her.
Guru has sent an imported Pooja Malhotra from America..
.. so that she marries me and changes me?
- Correct.
Uncle, I need a very impish, roguish and talented wife.
Impish, roguish and talented?
But nowadays it's so difficult to find..
.. an impish, roguish and talented wife.
all of them are married.
I am there.
But what will tell our Guru?
Let the Guru's mother go to hell.
Does he have a sister?
- Yes.
Then we shall send both of them.
- Okay.
Both mother and sister will go to hell.
Prem.
Who called me Prem so hatefully?
What did you think?
I will wait for you at Terminal 3?
And you will click a photograph here..
, and fool father?
- Pooja.
How did you recognize us?
Not you, him.
Daddy had given his description when I was leaving America.
I scanned the entire airport.
He was the only rogue with an innocent face.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
What an image you have, Prem.
I'm proud of you.
Why are you in a wedding dress?
What did you think?
I'll come from America in a two-piece bikini?
It would've been better.
- Just shut up.
Come on!
Let's go.
Excuse me.
Don't take advantage of the situation.
And don't you dare touch me.
Let's go.
Wow.
Impish, roguish and talented.
I should have asked for something else, uncle.
What better could have you asked for?
Think about it.
A young and old imp at home.
And they will bet on who is more impish.
Your aunt and she will get along well.
Truly.
I'lI bet on your girl.
They are here.
Pooja is here.
Pooja is here.
Brother, is she Pooja?
Or has he brought some other girl from her wedding?
You all must be surprised, right?
Seeing me dressed as a bride.
You see, a girl looks her best in a wedding dress.
So, I told myself, "Pooja, don't take a chance."
"If you want to impress everyone.."
".. then go dressed as a bride.
- Very impressed."
Impish.
Okay, tell me, how did you Iike our Prem?
Yes.
How did you like you?
I liked all of you a lot.
Very talented.
And if all of you support me then..
.. we will change him for good as well.
Talented also.
- Okay.
Then all of us are with you.
Come in.
Come in.
Come in.
- Come in, dear.
She will change him for good.
She didn't bring any bags with her.
What was the need to bring any luggage?
I'm not staying in a hotel.
I'm staying with my in-laws.
There is anything lacking in here?
Yes, only that like you was lacking.
That..
What?
- What do you call a son's that?
Daughter-in-law.
- We were only lacking a daughter-in-law..
.. and now your presence has changed that as welI.
Your father has become that.
- Mad?
Should I tell your father?
You are saying such things about my elder brother?
Yes?
tell us, when are you going for the wedding?
I just ran from a wedding.
You ran away from it?
But you were going to Phuket for your friend's wedding, right?
Yes, I was going to.
What do you mean, "l was going to?"
If you didn't go there then how did you ran away from it?
By ran away I mean I got rid of it with great difficulty.
Why would I unnecessarily waste my time in Phuket?
That's right.
Why waste time in Phuket?
If I would attend my friend's wedding..
.. then how would I make arrangements for my wedding?
And I have to fulfil the responsibility Guru has given me.
She will marry you.
She is wishful-serpent.
I will never let her wish come true.
Sir, Pooja's on the line.
Pooja?
- Pooja?
It's for Pooja.
Give it to me.
Hello.
Hi.
How are you?
I'm standing at the airport since the Iast two hours..
.. and you are asking how are you?
I'm not okay, understand?
My friend.
The one who is getting married.
She is very angry.
Anyway, look, I am waiting at the airport, come on.
And he didn't come to pick me up.
- Didn't get the time.
I have come here from America and he didn't get the time?
If you don't believe me then talk to Prem's dad.
I?
- Dad, she is calling all of you.
tell her that you all are not free.
- Yes.
Look, we cannot come.
We don't have that.
tell her that we don't have a car.
- No, we have a car.
The thing that moves like this.
pendulum.
- We don't have a pendulum.
Excuse me?
- Time.
No, we don't have time.
Sorry.
Heard that?
Now do you believe me?
If you don't have time then even I am not stupid..
.. to waste my time for you over here.
I'm going to attend my friend's wedding.
And I'll go to Guru's ashram after 8-10 days.
If you finally have the time and you wish to meet me..
.. then you can come there.
Understand?
Okay.
That's a great idea.
Bye.
Come, Pooja, I'lI take you to the guestroom.
Aunt, am I a guest that I'Il stay in the guest room?
I'Il stay in Prem's room.
In Prem's room?
- Before this?
Before marriage?
Until we get married, Prem will stay in the guestroom.
Yes.
Don't worry about him.
He can also sleep on a table.
Look, he is sleeping.
Ma'am, if you want to stay then stay in the guestroom..
.. otherwise, I'Il make you disappear in such a way..
Prem.
- Daddy, my room..
Uncle, cool down.
Now I am here.
I'Il handle it.
Now look here, my future husband.
For now, I have just snatched your room.
After that I'll snatch your sleep and peace of mind as well.
I'Il make you empty.
Empty.
You..
- No abusing.
Come, aunt.
Show me my room.
Go.
Go.
Show it to her.
- I'll be right back.
Brother, she will set him straight.
Isn't she very delicate?
- She is a lizard.
A lizard.
I don't know where that girl is.
I'm telling the truth.
You lost her.
My men couldn't find her.
Where did she go?
She doesn't know anyone in the city.
And no one knows her.
Where can she go?
Where can she go?
Where?
Where?
Hit him.
I want her at any cost before Suraj Chaudhary to her.
Someone stop me.
She is one piece from head to toe.
How do I cut her into pieces?
Prem, control your mind.
I'Il control my mind but..
This girl with a face that looks a mix of banana and mango..
If you scream this Rampuri dagger will take to straight to Lord Rama.
You are taking advantage of the situation.
Situation?
Advantage?
Again?
She will yak and force someone..
.. to think about it even if he isn't in the mood.
But what will you gain by killing me?
The CEO of fools, I won't benefit from it, you will.
I'Il double your value.
- What?
How much is a live chicken worth?
- Rs.100.
And how much is a Tandoori chicken worth?
- 200.
So doesn't that double the value after death?
You will snatch my peace of mind?
You will snatch my room?
If you don't leave by tomorrow morning..
.. then I swear by Baba Rampuri..
.. I will kill you.
What happened?
- What happened, dear?
What happened?
- What happened?
What happened?
She must have had a nightmare.
She must have screamed.
A Iot can happen in a nightmare.
Like..
Yes, a sneeze.
I was dreaming?
- Look, she is agreeing.
Come on, go back to sleep.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- She was dreaming.
Let us know if you need anything.
- Let's go.
Okay, goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Never underestimate three things in life.
Shucks..
Me, me and me.
Now you only bloody decide whether..
.. you have to come to this house in a palanquin..
.. or you want to leave this house.. as a dead person.
"Oh, Lord of the whole universe."
"Mighty Lord of the whole universe."
"All Thy devotees' agonies.. "
"All Thy devotees' sorrows.. "
"Instantly Thou banish."
"Oh, Lord of the whole universe."
Great.
I feel I am going to have a great day in office.
After all my day began with such a nice prayer.
You have been named aptly.
We are feeling as if we are in Hardiwar.
- Yes.
We have got such a nice daughter-in-law.
Dear, you are so cultured and you have such good values..
.. in spite of living in America.
Bush taught Obama and Obama taught her.
So who is her mother is in America?
Obama?
Listen..
To celebrate Pooja arrival we will distribute that in the office.
That..
- Tennis ball?
No, not that.
- Paperweight.
'Ladoo' (Indian sweet).
Right, brother?
Yes. 'Ladoos'.
We will distribute 'Ladoo'.
We will distribute 'Ladoos'.
Yes, they are round as weIl.
The world is also round.
should we distribute that?
- No, no, no.
What kind of people there are in the world, uncle.
Of different types.
They neither pray in the morning nor go to work.
Yes.
- True, dear.
There are such people as well.
What times have come!
There's a demon staying in a God's house.
I'Il have to use my demonic mind.
Uncle.
- What happened?
What happened?
What happened?
- Nothing.
It's a small injury.
Should I seek revenge?
Here you go.
Mother Earth.
Bad mummy.
Bad mummy, Mother Earth.
- Sorry, uncle.
He was trying to make me fall but you fell instead.
But why was he trying to make you fall?
Anger.
I said a few true things and he got angry.
He got irritated.
Why get irritated with it?
She is telling the truth.
He is always either on his bike or his skates.
Otherwise he keeps building his body in the spare time.
Why are you ruining my healthy body?
Everyone is saying something or the other..
.. don't you have to say something?
God sent him here to increase the burden on earth.
You are telling the truth for the first time.
We have been given a life..
.. only so that he can disgrace us.
Absolutely right.
- He is a big disgrace.
You have a great sense of honour, uncle.
Even a Satan will look like a God in front of him.
Great.
- Wonderful.
He is..
- I think I'll have to tell aunt about your affair, uncle.
I'm not saying it from my heart.
Don't take it to your heart.
My hand broke.
- Be careful.
Be careful.
Be careful.
Take me to a hospital.
- We'll have to do something about her.
She's digging a grave for you.
What happened?
- I cannot move it.
I'Il handle her.
Because uncle, once she is gone, life is fun.
Great, Pooja.
Great.
- Enough.
It is delicious.
- Fantastic.
- She cooks so well.
- Yes.
Outstanding.
Outstanding.
Yes.
- And she sings so well.
- Yes.
And she is also changing our spoilt brat for good.
- Yes.
Look, he is here.
Son, your name is Prem (love) and not 'Hatred'.
Right?
- Really?
Hey, listen.
Hello.
- Sit.
Madam, go.
Go to the airport.
Come on.
Why?
- Your wather has sent a parcel for you.
From USA.
- Yes, so why are you giving me the news?
You should have collected it for me.
He is useless.
You sing so well.
You cook so well.
What would have happened if you had studied a little as well?
The officer there won't give the parcel to me without your signature.
You only will have to go there.
How will the poor girl go to airport alone?
You go with her, Prem.
Am I her driver, chauffer or servant?
Brother.
- Prem, you go with her.
Daddy, you are very that.
- I am very boring.
But still, you will go.
Go, dear.
Go.
Yes, but dad didn't inform me over the phone.
Oh, fax.
- What?
He has sent a fax, you dirty mind.
Why are you wasting time talking, Prem?
The parcel will go back.
Come on, leave.
Go.
please go, son.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Be careful.
I think he's up to something.
I have a mobile. I'Il call if anything happens.
only if he will let you call.
'l could've easily spent 10-12 days in this house..'
'..if he wouldn't have been born here.'
'She has made my wamiIy crazy about her in two days.' 'l would be dead if she would stay for 12 days.'
'He cannot stop taking advantage.'
'We take advantage of those we would gain something from.' 'l am just trying to get rid of her.'
'Airport is on the left and he is taking a right turn.' 'ls he planning to take me to the jungle and..'
'No, madam.
If I do any such thing..'
'..then I'Il get stuck with you forever.'
'Then I will have to marry you.'
'Then why is he taking me to a jungle?
'
'WilI he leave me amidst wild animals?
' 'l would have if I wasn't so concerned about the poor animals.' 'l think I'll have to show her a few lions.'
How can you even think of such a thing?
What are you doing?
Where are the keys?
- I threw it.
The steering wheel got locked.
Why did you throw it?
Are you a woman or what?
I'm a woman.
- If you are a woman..
..then you should have kept the keys here, like a woman.
Keys are not kept there.
Keys are kept around the waist.
To hell with your 26" waist.
I can see a six and a half foot grave there.
Move the steering wheel.
No, steering wheel has failed.
The steering wheel has failed.
Your mind has failed.
But the brakes didn't fall, right?
- No, they didn't.
Prem.
- She's gone.
- Prem.
Prem.
Where are you?
- I am here.
Down here.
She was hanging me, now God has hanged her.
Are you dead or alive?
I'm still alive, but I can die anytime.
Help me.
- Okay.
Take this.
Take my hand.
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come closer first.
No, I am thinking that it's better..
..if one person dies rather than two.
Coward.
Dastard.
Pansy.
Chicken.
Should I come there to help you so that you can help me?
Let me ask help for myself first.
Hurry up.
- Help me, God.
Give me your leg.
- You are already hanging.
How else should I hang you?
I mean give me your leg.
Leg?
Man and woman look good in pair.
But to touch something with ones' leg is a grave sin.
You are hanging on the branch with both your hands.
How will you save me?
Ma'am, each hand of mine has 2 times a gorilla's strength.
Depending on age and size.
By the way, I can save you with one hand.
Then Useless, use that hand.
Hold my waist and pull me.
No, no, no.
Not the waist.
Then you will say that I took advantage.
What?
- By the way your waist is..
Let my waist go to hell.
Hold whatever you want.
Do whatever you want.
But please save me.
In that case, come to me, my suitcase.
Look madam, you are taking advantage of my disadvantage.
- What?
If you come any closer, then I swear..
..I'lI let go of both the hands and embrace you.
And both of us will be dead.
please save me.
Let's go.
What are you doing?
Just hanging around.
Don't worry.
You women are amazing.
You cannot stick on to anything other than your age.
Sometimes you say take the advantage..
..sometimes you say don't take advantage.
What nonsense is this?
all your yakking is making me go crazy.
It was the demand of the situation.
I wasn't wrong to touch you now.
I was wrong to touch you earlier.
If this is not wrong then why is that wrong?
And if that is wrong then why isn't this wrong?
actually, you are wrong.
It is wrong to sit here and talk to you.
It's of no use. I'll lie down.
Obviously it's of no use.
I'm sitting and you are lying down.
It would've benefited if either ..
.. both of us were sitting or lying down.
Look, don't say double meaning things to me.
This is a limit to illiteracy.
Where is a double meaning in it?
Look, don't turn and sleep like this. I feel something inside.
By the way, the jean fits well..
..on your waist.
My ilI-fate I wish he wasn't a man.
And you weren't a woman.
Sanjana Singh.
Pooja has horns.
Prem!
'Prem.
Prem.
Prem.' lsn't it a great place?
You call out once and it echoes back a number of times.
You have brought me here to hear this?
Oh, no.
This is nothing.
Now I'll shout your name and see what name echoes back.
Should I?
Sanjana!
'Sanjana.
Sanjana.
Sanjana.'
Hear it.
'Sanjana.
Sanjana.
Sanjana.' l'm saying Pooja and it is echoing back as Sanjana.
Isn't it a strange place?
Look, the valley is so deep.
Prem.
- only echoes come back from here, not people.
tell me the truth.
Who are you?
Otherwise, I'lI let go of you.
I'Il tell you the truth.
Pull be back first.
Come on, start your story.
You already know my real name.
Sanjana Singh.
actually, I had come from America to get married.
But the guy I was going to get married to..
..turned out to be a famous don's son.
I ran away from the wedding but they snatched my passport.
It takes at least 10-12 days to make a new passport.
I needed a place to hide as weIl.
Then I saw you at the airport.
You had come to pick up Pooja and no one knew Pooja.
So I thought..
You know the rest.
- I know the rest.
What did you do with the real Pooja?
I hope you didn't murder her.
No.
She has gone to attend her friend's wedding, in Phuket.
She will go to Guru's ashram from there.
Guru.
Guru.
Guru.
He is a..
Let's go.
Prem.
Hey, move aside.
"My heart broke."
"My heart went crazy."
I think you want me..

- Brother?
This car won't go anywhere.
It has broken-down.
Why?
What happened, darling?
Darling?
- The car will run.
It will get repaired.
I'm a mechanic.
It's my job.
Hope in.
Yes.
- But you didn't ask me where you should drop me.
I haven't caught you as yet, to drop you.
First let me introduce myself.
I'm Mr. Lehri.
I'm sure you know Bhappi Lehri.
There is no connection between us.
Yes, there is a connection.
He likes gold and I Iike to sleep.
Hello.
Why are you whistling?
You've already won over me.
Are you from Pataya?
Who is he?
is he your boyfriend?
No, he is a distant friend.
- A distant friend?
Just like a distant relative.
Okay.
Then I have no problem..
..because I am shortsighted.
So shall we leave, Mr. Weak?
Hello.
I keep a person like you as my driver.
really?
- Yes.
- Then give me the keys.
Come on.
The key is in its place.
I got a driver.
Come on, darling.
Come behind.
Come on.
Come on.
Watch your feet.
You aren't in the mood to come behind?
Not a problem.
We'Il talk from here.
Great. lt's such a young and beautiful weather.
When I look at you I remember a romantic phrase.
tell me.
Mingle in jungle.
I, too, remember a phrase when I see you.
A.K. Hangal in the jungle.
You know liquor and beauty have a deep connection?
I'm often intoxicated and the evening passes away.
There will be a day when the evening will be intoxicated..
..and you will pass away.
Hello.
I'm not here to get insulted.
Where do you usually go to get insulted?
Where will I go?
I stay at home.
I'm married.
You give a lift to a single girl even when you are married?
Who doesn't?
I only give, you take it as welI, forcefully.
Watch out!
What is he doing up there?
PIucking fruits.
He plucked a lot of fruits.
Oh no!
- What have you done?
I didn't do it.
You did it.
Hard work paid off, didn't it?
You were driving very passionately.
Whose car is this?
- This is my car.
It's not a car. lt is my wife.
I Iove it.
If your wife has an affair with someone..
..then who will work hard on her?
Her lover, who else?
Who will enjoy it?
- My wife, who else?
Who will get punished?
- Me, who else?
So just imagine.
She is your wife.
Who was working hard on her?
- You.
Who was enjoying it?
- She was.
Who will get punished?
Me, who else?
Because it was my car.
Don't cry, my son.
Be strong.
The Lord works in mysterious ways, my son.
Have this fruit.
You are a Father?
Father.
Father, I had bad thoughts about her.
Father, I'm a sinner.
I've committed a grave sin, Father.
I am a sinner.
Hey!
Stop the car.
There's the girl.
What have I done!
- Prem, let's go.
They are his men.
Come.

Come on.
Fast.
Or she'Il escape.
- I want to confess.
Where is that girl?
- Which girl?
The one who was standing here with you.
Your sister.
She..
Sister?
I think she ran away with brother-in-Iaw.
Listen, have you seen our boss?
Who is your boss?
- tail, board, huge man.
Okay, this..
What are you asking?
I'm selling these fruits here.
The fruits of hard work.
These fruits are very tasty.
Just taste them.
No. I didn't.
My car hit him.
Get him.
- My car hit him.
Mr. Chaudhary, your son has gone into coma..
..because of excess blood loss.
I don't know when he will regain consciousness.
Quickly resuscitate him, Doctor..

Send me as welI, sir.
To my home, sir.
Look, sir, it was my car but your son was hit by that boy.

I swear on him.
Let him go.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
So sweet.
Yes.
Sir, I am leaving but before leaving..
..I would like to give you a small warning.
Sir, that boy is very smart.
He is fast, in driving cars and using his brain as well.
If he will come before you he will do such actions that..
..you will forget to give reactions.
Has anyone seen that boy?
I've only seen him from the left side.
And I've only seen him from the right side.
Sir, what is this left and right.
I've seen him from centre.
Will you be able to recognize him?
You are talking about recognizing?
actually, I was born when I was small.
My mother was a woman.
And the person who murdered my wather..
..underwent plastic surgery thrice.
Yet I recognized him.
Because he used to come to our shop to buy the plastic.
From now onwards, this plastic will always be with us.
Take him away.
- No.
This is wrong.
Shut up.
- This is wrong.
Find that boy and Sanjana.
Wherever they are hiding find them.
What?
- What kind of childishness is this, Pooja?
is this a way to behave?
Does anyone hold and push anyone like this?
How was that?
- What did you do?
Like this..
Like this..
What did you do?
- What did I do?
You held her like this and pushed her like this.
The push she got had that.
The push she got had minimal effect?
- Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
Take your position.
- From there.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Come, come, one by one.
- Come on.
Come on.
Talk to your darling nephew.
- Yes.
From the time they have returned from the jungle..
..there is a lot of fun happening around.
"It is fun. lt is fun.
It is fun."
Excuse me.
Just friends.
- Play the wedding tune.
Just friends.
Prem!
Prem, your method was wrong but your intentions were good.
Now I have no complaints against you.
- Mr. Pathak.
No.
No.
No.
My Khushi is so happy with Raju that I forgot all my sorrows.
Great.
Great.
Great.
- That's great.
You know I'm going to London.
Raju sent the tickets.
- Of economic class?
Yes.
- Yes.
How do you know that?
- Because I gave Raju the idea.
I told him not to buy first class tickets as you are such a miser..
..that you will be happy even with economic class ticket.
What happened?
- It got wet.
- What?
What is this, Daddy?
You always say double meaning things.
There is no double meaning in it.
The thing which we talk.
With which..
Mobile.
Mobile.
mobile.
- Mobile?
My purse.
- My money.
My purse.
Your underwear.
Let's get out of this.
Today, I got that and after a long time that happened.
You got wet and fell in love?
No, I caught cold.
Today, the Sunday truly feels like a Sunday.
A Sunday will always be a Sunday.
- Yes.
We never go in the swimming pool together even if we want to, right?
really.
- Thank you, Pooja.
- You're welcome.
Welcome.
Thank you. I am Ready.
But there is a No Entry here.
Someone stop me.

A junior priest has come from Guru's place.
He is here?

The junior priest is here.
I'Il go meet him and welcome him.
My wallet..
From the drawer..
That one.
Yes.
And the wallet..
Priest, why are you here?
I mean what brings you here?
I'Il tell that later, but Guru is very angry with you.
Why?
- Why didn't you go to pick up Pooja from the airport?
I had gone there..
..but I got a little late.
She left to attend the wedding.
Yes, she will be going to the ashram directly from the wedding.
Be there on time to pick her up.
- As you say.
Where is everyone else?
- They are with Pooja..
But Pooja is..
- Not this one, the Pooja which was sent last month.
We sent a dog last month..
- Don't call her a dog.
The family members have named her Pooja.
They have named her Pooja?
A dog..
- Again you are calling her a dog.
Doggie, dog, puppy, pup, Raju, Tommy.
Nothing.
Call her Pooja.
Otherwise with a broom..
They are so madly in love with her that nowadays we eat dog food..
Dog..
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Pooja's food.
Pedigree and White Kennel.
So what should I call her?
Pooja?
Don't call her that if you want to lose your loincloth..
..and your honour.
Hello, Priest.
They are here to serve you.
Hello.
hello.
Hello.
hello.
- hello.
Hello.
Bless you.
Bless you.
Guru had kept a 'Satyanarayan' ritual..
- Very good.
He has sent the offering of that.
Sanjana..
As soon as they call for Pooja you come with the dog.
tell me, where is Pooja.
She is here.
Pooja.
Now what do I tell you, Priest.
We have got very attached to Pooja in such a short span.
She is so sweet that as soon as she came, Prem..
She won everyone's heart.
'Oh God, what magic has this dog done in one month?
'
Our Pooja is as decent as she is beautiful.
'A decent dog?
'
'Have they lost their mind?
'
She is now our wamiIy member.
Does she bite?
What kind of a joke is that?
is she a suckling that she will bite?
She is of marriageable age.
It's a different thing if she starts biting after marriage.
Whether she bites, scratches or does anything else..
..we have decided that she'll be the daughter-in-law of our family.
'They will make a dog their daughter-in-law?
'
'A dog will be perfect for you, son.'
'You deserve this.'
What are you thinking about?
That is happening with Guru's permission.
'Dandiya', 'Garba' (Gujarati dance forms).
No, no, no.
That..
That..
That..
Yes.
The alliance.
- The alliance.
The alliance.
'l think they have gone absolutely crazy.'
'They didn't go to pick up the Pooja Guru had sent..'
'..from the airport.'
'They have named their dog Pooja..'
'..and they are getting him married to her.' 'l'll also go crazy if I stay here any longer.' l'Il make a move.
Have lunch before you leave.
- Yes.
Pooja's favourite dishes have been made today.
'Oh, God.
They are feeding dog food to a priest?
'
Look, I..
You can have it.
I'm wasting today.
I'Il make a move.
- Bye.
- Okay, Priest.
- Okay, Priest.
Who is this girl?
You don't recognize her?
You are strange.
She is our maid.
You had brought her here from the ashram.
'Look at that.
These lunatics think I am crazy.' 'l hope I really don't go crazy.'
Excuse me.
I'll make a move.
Okay.
- Okay.
"Baby, I can see the sun rising in your eyes."
"Baby, every time I think of you, you make me smile."
"Baby, I'Il be your every dream and you should know.."
"Baby, I'Il never ever want to let you go."

Maids.
- Yes, brother.
Where is everybody gone?
Brother..
Gone ashram.
Meeting Guru.
And Pooja?
- Gone.. with them too.
Why, brother?
Heart beating fasting?
Brother, where are you running?
Come on, come on.
- Come.
This is Guru's that.
What is it called..
As..
Ashram.
We've come here to fix a wedding date for your marriage with Prem.
Yes.
Let's go.
You go ahead.
We'll come.
- Okay.
Pooja, it is believed that all wishes..
Come.
Which Pooja are you talking about, Ram?
Pooja has not returned from her friend's wedding.
Then who is the one who has been staying..
..in our house as Pooja since the past few days.
Who is the scoundrel you ran away with?
kill his entire wamiIy.
How is that possible!
You want me, right?
I'm ready to come with you.
Let's go.
Come on.
Leave me.
Brother-in-law.
Sanjana is not here.
I knew that you would surely come.
And I, too, knew that you would say..
.."l knew that you would surely come."
Why should I come, huh?
Am I your boyfriend?
I love you?
- Saw?
You are agreeing to it.
No.
Really?
He's your uncle?
Yes.
Prem, how would I tell you that..
..these goons, mafias are my maternal uncles?
Great.
Your wamiIy members are like charles Shobraj and Ranja BilIa?
I love these mafia people.
Stop joking, Prem.
You don't know how much my uncles hate each other
My mother's last wish was..
..that I get both my uncles' blessings at my wedding.
So that their enmity ends forever..
..and they become good human beings like they were, earlier.
But?
- The greed of attaining my property worth 200 crores..
..increased their enmity.
Each one of them wants me to marry his brother-in-Iaw.
200 crores?
I can draw a cheque without deducting the TDS..
..and keep your uncles in my pocket.
But my dear, until there are obstacles in a love story..
..it is not called a love story.
What stories will we tell our children?
Look, a boyfriend gets scared of his girlfriend.
A girlfriend gets scared of a cockroach.
A cockroach gets scared of a mouse.
A mouse gets scared of a cat.
A cat gets scared of a dog.
And a dog gets scared of a man.
- And a man is scared of a woman.
- What?
Just like a villain..
gets scared of the hero.
Prem, Iet's go.
My uncle is here.
What now?
They will..
- Don't worry, dear.
Today, I'll predict your future.
You will get married to an innocent looking rogue.
That's me.
Now can I take some advantage?
By the way, the fitting of the Indian dress is very good.
"Ready..
I am ready for you.
Are you ready for me?"
"Are you ready for me?
Are you ready for me?"
"Are you ready for me?
I am ready for you."
Uncle, Yuvraj was forcefully..
I ran away from there.
Sit in the car.
They are drying out.
What should I do about this boy?
This boy is making me that.
That..
irritate?
- No, not irritate.
That..
This..
This..
Emotional?
- Emotional is like this.
This..
- So?
He is making me this.
This.
This..
Crazy.
- Crazy.
- Crazy.
He is making crazy.
Crazy.
Crazy.
He lied to me.
That girl is not this but that.
What..
- Not Sanjana, Pooja.
Pooja.
Yes.
Yes.
What you are thinking of doing is not so easy.
They are dangerous.
- Yes.
They are dons.
I would've said the same had I been in your place.
But.. what would've you done had you been in my place?
Why don't you make him understand?
What should I tell him?
all I know is that Sanjana is a very nice girl.
And right now, she must be in trouble.
She must be in big trouble.
That's true, sister-in-law.
But there is no solution to this problem.
I have such a solution that I'll make the lives of both the dons, hell.
They have a common CA, who has done BA.
And his name..
What was his name?
Sounds like bully.
- Idli (a south Indian snack)?
MuIli (Raddish)?
Pulley.
- TaIli (drunk)?
No, close.
Close.
Khuli (open)?
KhaIi?
Khali.
Balli.
Balidaan Bhardwaj.
Sakku, how many times will you call me?
I feel that you call me even when you dial a wrong number.
What do I do?
You have left the house with so much cash.
I'm feeling scared.
This isn't the first time I'm out with so much cash.
I do transactions worth millions, day and night.
all 500 and 1000 denomination bills..
..across the world knows BaIidaan Bhardwaj.
Then?
- That's fine.
But what if a thief stabs you and robs you?
Sakku, are you concerned about me..
..or are you trying to kill me?
Hang up, Sakku.
I want two demands drafts made.
One of 30 lakhs and the other of 20 lakhs.
Take this.
My bag?
My bag!
Where did my bag go?
Where is my bag?
There was 50 lakhs in the bag.
Where did the bag go?
My bag.
My bag got stolen.
Have you seen a thief here?
- No.
You blind man, you didn't see the thief?
You didn't even see such a big bag?
I didn't see it. I'm not the owner of it.
You..
Have you seen your face?
It's so black that if shown on national Television..
..it will ward off evil from the entire country.
Sakku, what you said came true.
Sakku.
What happened?
Amar Chaudhary and Suraj Chaudhary's 50 lakhs got stolen.
What?
Don't do this.
Pack the bags.
It's time to leave the city.
Come on.
- Yes.
They are here.
Tell them I am not here.
I'Il go and hide myself.
Mr. Bhardwaj.
Mr. Bhardwaj.
He has not only left this house but this world as welI.
A trunk ran over him.
- Oh, no.
He got crushed.
Do you have anyone to look after you in this cruel world?
No.
By the way, I had brought this bag for him.
What will I do of this briefcase when he is no more?
Don't worry.
I'lI take care of both his belongings.
Okay?
Let's meet after his final rites.
Thank you.
Bring it here.
Where are you going?
You are alive, sir?
- Yes, I'm alive.
It's her hobby.
She kills her husband over everything.
Start wearing a wedding chain from tomorrow.
People get mistaken.
She is mine.
And.. this bag is also mine.
There are only 50 lakhs in it, right, sir?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
There are only 50 lakhs..
Just a minute.
How did you come to know that there are 50 lakhs in it?
Just be looking at the bundle of the notes..
..I can predict how many notes it contains.
How?
- l learnt this art from my master.
Mr. B. B., sir.
Bishan Singh Bedi?
- No, sir.
Then?
Balibhrambhat.
- No, no, sir.
Bichun Bhutia.
Goal.
No way, sir.
The one who has written this book.
Mr. BaIidaan Bhardwaj.
Be careful, sir.
I've written a book?
When did I write this book?
Such a fat book?
You?
- Yes.
Look at this.
The Balidaan in front of Bhardwaj is me.
That's me.
This is a sign of a genius.
You wrote a book and you don't even remember.
Sir, this book is a missile and you are an example..
..for a newcomer like me.
I have come to this city to be your assistant, sir.
I see.
- I want to learn the ropes of this job with you.
I don't want any money either.
- Then my job is done.
I mean yourjob is done.
- Thank you, sir.
I have only two clients.
Amar Chaudhary and Suraj Chaudhary.
Sir, they are mafias.
One is a mongoose.
And the other one is a snake.
If they get together then they are killer sharks.
But both of them are illiterates.
How many times during a year do you think..
..people like Chaudhary must be paying their taxes?
Sir, they must not even be paying the taxi fare.
Sir..
I make them pay tax every month.
Every month?
Again and again.
- Again and again.
12 times.
- 12 times.
Yes.
What do I do?
It is dirty but it is my business.
It is your business.
This is the only way to teach a lesson to those goons.
Sir, your name is Balidaan but you are making your clients sacrifice.
Now that you have joined me..
..everyone will be sacrificed..
with Prem (Iove).
Come with us.
Come with us.
- Why are you hitting me?
Hit him.
Stop.
Stop.
Don't hit me.
Stop.
Stop. I am your teacher, Amar Chaudhary.
Teacher?
You are a cheater, you scoundrel.
You give me a zero in the exams.
You gave the wrong answer.
What was the question?
Who is the president of India?
- Mrs. Prathiba PatiI.
You had said that it was Abdul KaIlam.
The president got changed.
It is my fault that the president got changed?
What do I have to do with when and where Alexander fought Porus?
Do I have to go there and dig their graves?
Hit him.
Hit him.
Hit him.
well done.
You are doing well, Amar Chaudhary.
Saw that?
That's why I named him after me.
Amar Chaudhary.
Hey, Amar Chaudhary!
You stinky insect of a dirty sewer?
Mother, you go inside.
- Stop barking, you dog.
And let him go.
Otherwise I'lI poison your food and feed you.
Got it?
Hey, go.
Take him back with dignity.
Go.
Yes.
- Go.
Let's go, sir.
Grandpa, you are being abused under his pretext.
No, no.
It's not so.
You are like a father to my daughter-in-law.
You are God.
A born leech.
- What?
See that.
He is.
This Amar Chaudhary.
It's time for school.
Don't you have to go?
Father, should I get something for you?
Yes, daughter-in-law.
Get some tea for me.
Okay.
- Without sugar.
And without poison.
Have some sweets, Mr. Chaudhary.
I got the land for your liquor factory cleared.
And it hardly cost you anything.
only 50 lakhs.
Balli.
- Yes.
Don't you know you cannot bring strangers in here?
Who is he?
- He's my nephew.
Nephew?
- Yes, look.
We look similar, don't we?
You mean when I am of your age I will look like you?
Forget about the wace, Mr. Chaudhary.
Talk about brains.
He is from America.
He will show your income so less..
..that you won't need to pay tax.
- Really?
You know the billionaire in America?
K.K. Modi.
He used to handle his account.
K. K. Modi?
- K. K. Modi?
Forget it.
Forget K. K. Modi.
Now that you are here you work for Mr. Chaudhary.
Handle his account.
Hire you nephew.
- Nephew!
Grandpa, it sounds like your business.
Ganja.
Balli.
- Yes?
You didn't teach your nephew how to salute?
Salute me.
What to get thrashed?
What did you say?
- No. I saw my horoscope in the morning.
Yes.
- In it it's written that if I salute..
..anyone younger than me today..
..then he will get thrashed all day long.
But still if you want..
- No, no.
Let it be.
But I have read his horoscope.
Balli.
Come on.
- Let it be, today.
My nephew is with me.
So..
Balli.
Yes.
Now my hands feel warmer.
The apple of my eye.
My brave boy.
- wild hippo, Amar Chaudhary.
Write 'welcome' on your face.
You will look like a rotten doormat.
Anyway, your ponytail looks like a dead dog's tail.
Look at your grandpa.
It suits him so well.
Take this.
Stupid.
Go to school.
Yes, grandpa.
This is the first time mother has said the right thing.
The girls in my class tease me.
They said it looks like theirs.
With your permission can I chop it off?
Amar Chaudhary, you can have your neck cut but not your ponytail.
This is a warning, not advice.
We are samurais.
This is the identity of our family.
Your I.D. proof.
It is a voter's card, pan card.
Your blood group.
A proof that you are his grandson and he is your grandpa.
Where did this boring old man come from?
Great grandpa.
I saw you.
Today my day will go well.
Concentrate on your studies.
Kids of your age have gone places.
People of your age as weIl..
..have gone places.
"Happy days are over."
"Now I'm surrounded with sadness."
What is this, Mr. Lehri?
What are you doing?
I'm having black coffee with Obama in the White House.
Can't you see?
I hit the brakes to give you a lift.
Now my shirt has turned into a mop.
all this happened because of me, right?
I'm feeling very guilty.
I love you too.
Now it is my duty to get you out of here.
I also want to leave.
Because if my children grow up they won't recognize me.
And my wife is so nave that the poor thing..
..might once again run away with someone.
No such thing will happen because I have a mind-bIowing idea.
This is the boy with whom Sanjana ran away, sir.
He doesn't look like he is from our city.
I'Il find him even if he is hiding underground.
Are you telling the truth?
Sir, if I am lying he should die immediately.
No, I take his oath and say that henceforth..
..that that boy was not him but someone else.
Sir.
- What happened?
Sir, someone has come to meet you.
Balli, you got the land cleared for Amar for his liquor factory?
I just got the land cleared for him.
But for you along with the land I also got..
..the license for the liquor factory cleared.
Lehri, go.
You are free to go.
Mr. Chaudhary, I am leaving but before leaving..
..I would like to give you a warning.
Sir, this boy is very smart.
only I know how he traps people.
You won't be able to anything to him..
..even if he comes and stands before you.
You do one thing.
You keep cleaning cars here till Sanjana's marriage.
Sir, what are you saying?
Sir, this is a crime.
It's a sin.
Mr. Chaudhary, you cannot do this.
Mr. Chaudhary can do anything.
He is Justice Chaudhary.
He provides justice to good people.
And he clears out the bad people.
Pick him and throw him out.
Balli, who is this boy?
He is a con.
C-O-N.
Con.
He joined hands with that girl and fooled me.
Which animal have I Ieft out?
- You dog, clean the car.
Mr. Chaudhary, isn't the boy useful?
Once I start working, there will be no income and no tax.
No income tax.
But Balli, how is this possible?
This boy will work for Amar as welI as us.
He has a habit..
..of doing two things together.
You know K.K. Modi in America?
He used to also handle his younger brother B.K. Modi's account.
But what if he turns out to be bad?
Then you can behead my uncle.
Behead me?
- Saw?
He agrees to it.
The thumb impression on the file.
Take it.
Just a minute.
Uncle, I was casually checking your accounts.
There are a lot of discrepancies.
What?
- There must be a slight difference.
21.
- 21..
BaIli.
There is a difference of Rs.21.
Rs.21, dear?
It's hardly a difference.
Just a minute, uncle.
You are his assistant, right?
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on, show me the accounts.
Uncle, I'Il go and check the accounts properly.
Yes, yes.
Okay, dear.
Hey..
Persuade her.
- Consider it done.
Balli, you saw how my niece's education is benefiting me?
Prem, this is not the right situation to take advantage.
really?
Then promise me that you will meet me tonight.
And you will let me take all the advantages.
- Prem.
You..
You okay?
- Yes.
I was just joking.
Balli, why do you look as if you've seen a ghost?
Our future daughter-in-Iaw is checking everything, right?
Yes. ln detail.
Come with me.
Come with me.
Let them work.
Saw that?
My future wife is no ordinary girl.
Yes, I just came to know.
She has taken after me deceased sister.
So, your sister was also like her?
Then the entire family..
What happened?
He is getting scared.
- He fears he might get caught.
Sanjana..
Sanjana is not my daughter.
She is more than a daughter to me, Prem.
Her happiness means everything to me.
But..
But you don't know her uncles.
They..
- I know.
They are rogues from the Neanderthal times.
Orthodox.
I am a modern age dog.
Latest.
When we will fight, I will eat them up.
"I am a dog and she is my partner."
"I tell the truth, when she came.."
"..there came a season to eat everyone up."
Stop it.
Look, aunt, everything will be fine.
I promise.
What were you doing inside?
all that cuddling and all?
Uncle, she fell over me.
girls from affluent families..
Hello.
girls from affluent families are like that.
Try to understand.
Whether she falls on you or you wall on her..
..our necks will get cut and fall down.
Uncle, you only asked me to persuade her.
I got persuaded.
You would've got exposed..
..if she would've opened the accounts.
This is the first time I have let a girl touch me and you..
No, no.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
You are my disciple.
Come on, get in.
Get in.
Let's go.
"In 12 months I'll express my love to you in 12 different ways."
"Now I think I won't be able to survive.."
"..even for 12 minutes without you."
"When the winter season starts in January."
"We will switch on the heater of love."
"In a blanket as small as February.."
"..we will play hide and seek."
"March will be a romantic month."
"We'll do something we have never done before."
"What if we aren't able to meet in April?"
"What will happen?
Find a solution."
"I'll get an internet connection so that I can chat with you."
"When the summer season starts in May.."
"..we will party at the poolside."
"We will take a Iong vacation in June."
"We will go to a hill station."
"When starts raining in July.."
"..
I'll yearn to embrace you."
"We will have a lot of fun in August."
"We will make some arrangements."
"I'll take you to London.
I'Il give you a tour of Paris."
"I'll take you on a world tour."
"I feel that I'll be coming often to your house in September."
"We'll see the sunsets together in October."
"You can keep your head on my shoulders."
"By the time the wretch November comes.."
"..you would've already surrendered your heart."
"Things will get confirmed on 12th December."
"With the confirmation from our hearts."
"There will be no car or mare."
"I'll bring the wedding procession on foot."
"In 12 months I'll express my love to you in 12 different ways."
"Now I think I won't be able to survive.."
"..even for 12 minutes without you."
Prem hasn't come as yet, dear.
Don't worry, aunt.
He will surely come.
Why don't you go and pay your respects..
..as you have come to the temple, Junior Chaudhary?
tell me.
I prayed for a week before my exams.
He failed me.
- Then why have you come here?
I'm my grandpa's junior spy.
Whenever any female in the family goes out of the house..
..I keep an eye on them.
Whether they are going and meeting our enemies.
Aunt.
Go.
My child.
Bless you.
- That's enough.
Bless you.
Sister.
Someone stop them.
You are crying?
They are bound to cry.
These sisters-in-law Iove each other more than their own sister.
In spite of living in the same city we have met after ages.
Our men our fighting and we women are suffering.
I wonder when this will end.
Like I have united the aunts I will unite the uncles as well.
If I don't turn this family into a 'Hum Aapke Hain Kyon' family..
..then don't call me Prem.
Thank you.
Okay, so you are befriending our enemies..
..in the pretext of praying and worshiping?
Son, she isn't an enemy.
She is your grandaunt.
Amar, my child.
- Don't touch me, you old woman.
ScoundreI, if you say a word more..
..I'lI feed you kerosene and light a match in front of your mouth.
Get out of here.
Forgive him, sister.
His grandfather has made him just like him.
I wonder when he will mend his ways.
Why are you laughing?
He will change, but I'm laughing..
..thinking of the way in which he will change.
Junior Chaudhary, the park is closed.
It's closed for others, not me.
Go and tell the manager, Amar Chaudhary is here.
The park will remain open.
Okay, sir.
- Okay, sir.
Come here, you animal.
Salute me.
The park should be closed now.
We have to go home.
You are refusing Amar Chaudhary?
Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
Come.
How dare you!
I won't spare you.
Who..
Who are you?
Badman.
Badman?
- Yes.
I'm here to turn a bad boy like you into a good boy.
You..
One kick and from Badman you will become a dead man.
Kick me.
Kick me.
Kick me.
really?
Here you go.
Darn him.
I am sorry, bad-man.
Spare me.
Forgive me.
Okay.
From today, you'll be a good boy.
Yes, I will.
You won't bunk school.
- Okay.
You won't trouble your teachers.
You'Il always respect your elders.
And you will cut your ponytail as welI.
- Yes.
No, no.
This is not possible.
It is the identity of my wamiIy.
Shut up.
The kid has tired me.
First try to talk things out.
If they don't understand then kick them.
Great, Balli.
Great.
Your nephew is one in a million.
Amar Chaudhary.
Why do you have bandana on your head?
It's the latest fashion, grandpa.
Okay.
Okay.
Fashion.
Come here, my tiger.
And hit on this jackal's head.
Bless me, uncle BaIli.
What are you doing?
Respecting my elders, grandfather.
This is what Badman has taught us.
Who Badman?
- He is our new teacher, grandpa.
Teacher?
Grandpa, his new teacher is Prem.
Dear, now I feel he'Il also bring my two scoundrels back on track.
Hello
Uncle, uncle Suraj is once again trying to get me married to Veer.
What?
- Yes.
But I want to marry your son, Yuvraj.
Yuvraj?
- Please, uncle.
please, do something.
please, quickly get me out of here.
Someone is coming.
Come on, get the cars out.
Load your guns.
Let there be bloodshed?
We will have to bring Sanjana at any cost by this evening.
What are you doing, Chaudhary..
Sir.
Uncle, tell them.
What you are doing is wrong.
You are going to kill your brother for 200 crores?
Whereas someone worth 500 crores is in uncle's pocket.
Who are you talking about?
Uncle, I'm talking about K.K Modi.
Yes.
K.K. Modi from America.
tell them how much he is worth.
He is worth 5000-7000 crores.
And hear this.
You know who has been given..
..the responsibility of getting his daughter Naina married?
Uncle.
Uncle, you couldn't see this gem of a person?
Whereas Naina desires a gem of a person.
They are such lovely people.
They are romantic.
They are going to kill their brothers.
Uncle, if I wouldn't have thought of this..
..then there would've been a bloodshed today.
Why don't you think?
No, the idea was on the way in my mind..
..but because of traffic..
Get this straight, Balli.
If we don't get this alliance then consider yourself death.
Get out of here.
I took K.K. Modi's name just like that.
You added his daughter to the story.
You added the responsibility of her marriage.
You added all the spices.
Sir, you told me all this..
after having a few drinks.
I told you about people who don't exist?
They exist, sir.
Listen.
- Yes?
Some K.K. Modi has called five times since morning.
He told me to remind you that he is coming..
..to India on Friday to discuss his daughter's wedding.
And yes, he has asked to book some resort.
Don't forget.
How is this possible?
Sir, this means you either have MP or UP.
Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh?
MP means memory power.
- Okay.
Sir, in this illness the battery of memory conks off.
Or UP that is unbelievable power.
Unbelievable power.
- Yes, sir.
In this the characters you think about come in real life.
I don't believe this.
That's why it is called unbelievable power.
Now you have to decide whether..
..it's your effective thinking or defective disease.
meanwhile, sir, you have thrown me out of the house.
Bye.
Taxi!
- No, Prem.
I said that as I was worried.
Please.
Okay.
- Don't leave me in such confusion.
Okay, sir.
tell me what I should do next.
There is no option or resort to this.
Yes, the last resort is that you book a resort.
Okay.
They have come?
Limo.
Ballu.
BaIlu.
Uncle, go and welcome Modi.
What a pleasant surprise.
Come here.
Come here.
Give your friend a hug.
You have become fit.
I think it is the result of sister-in-Iaw Shakuntala's that.
Love.
- Her love.
How is sister-in-law Sakku?
I hope you didn't have any that on the way.
What is it..
No, no.
One has to take some that for one's child.
Some..
Trouble.
- Yes, trouble.
Let's go.
Mr. Modi.
- Mr. Modi.
Stop. ls this a way to ask for donations?
Mr. Modi, he is Mr. Chaudhary.
A very famous L in the city.
- landlord?
- Landlord.
- landlord.
Mr. Modi, welcome, welcome, welcome.
Welcome.
Uncle Modi.
Aunt Modi.
Balli works for us.
Okay, BaIli knows you.
That means he is our that..
Guest.
- Guest.
Guest.
Call him tonight for..
- Drinks?
Dinner.
Dinner.
And that as well.
Let's go.
Why are you staring at them with your mouth open?
Have you seen them for the first time?
Anyone will give that reaction on seeing Mr. Modi.
Sir, if you are a mouse then he is a cat.
If you are a cat, he is a dog.
If you are a dog, he is a fox.
If you are a fox then he is a lion.
If you are lion then he is an elephant.
If you are an elephant then he is a dinosaur.
Dinosaur of business, sir.
For your own good, come on time for dinner.
Otherwise you are a donkey, sir.
Who is going anywhere?
I am here till night.
Yes.
- Yes.
Let's go.
What happened, uncle?
He met me with so much affection.
He gave me a hug as weIl.
But I couldn't recognize him.
is it an illness or my imagination?
Both.
- Both?
One personality is ill.
It is the imagination of the other personality.
The first and the second personality clashed..
..with each other and resulted in the third personality.
Spilt personality.
The fourth personality will be suicidal personality.
You will feel like committing suicide, uncle.
You are right.
- No.
I feel like committing suicide.
- No.
Yes.
- Don't do it, uncle.
- Why?
You won't remember that you have committed suicide, uncle.
So what should I do?
Uncle, now you have only one option left.
What?
- Believe that your personality with imagination is right.
You know him.
He is K.K. Modi.
- You recognize him.
I'Il have to.
Otherwise, I'lI commit suicide..
..and I won't even remember it.
So what's the use?
He is K.K. Modi.
Mr. Modi, we are not as rich as you are.
But we are well respected in the city.
Great.
- Yes, sir.
They are decent people.
really?
- They have a lot of cars and are cultured as weIl.
So brother, tell us, how much loan do you want?
No, sister-in-law, I am..
Balli, tell them.
- What should I say?
Uncle, with your permission can I tell them?
- Yes, please.
Mr. Modi, he is his brother-in-law.
Yuvraj.
He has studied till the 8th grade.
The 8th grade.
Raise two more fingers.
Yes, the 8th grade.
He has studied till the 8th grade.
So?
He wants to marry your daughter.
- What?
Brother BalIu, you have brought such an alliance?
Have you seen their faces?
They look as if they have just come out of a jungle.
Right.
will their daughter marry into this illiterate family?
The Modis.
They don't have any sense of that.
Fashion.
Nor do they know how to that.
- talk.
To talk.
They look like that.
That..
Ape-men.
- Ape-men.
If you weren't my friend I would have done that.
Shot.
- Shot you.
Let's go..
- Sumitra.
- Sumitra.
Let's go.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- Okay.
You ruined their mood.
- Shut up.
Shut up.
You..
I'Il blow your head with you, you scoundrel.
You fool, he isn't a scoundrel, you are.
Do you know who are you messing with?
You can only make scrabbled-eggs from an egg.
Mr. Modi can turn scrabbled-eggs back to an egg.
You have spoilt the whole game.
But it's okay.
Uncle is here.
He will think of something.
What will I think of?
I am totally confused.
Will you tell us what this is all about?
Why have you made us all wear sunglasses?
Excuse me for my language, grandpa.
But what do these Modis think of themselves?
They have kept three conditions for the wedding.
I told them that I won't be able to look into your eyes..
..after telling you those conditions.
And you won't be able to look at each other after hearing them.
He said, "Here, make them wear these sunglasses.."
"..and tell them the conditions."
tell us.
Tell us, what their conditions are.
basically the Modis have made..
..the tent of Chaudhary's lives stand on three sticks.
Condition No. 1.
They don't like the way you dress.
What are you doing?
They say that you look like a C-Grade movie's villain.
How dare they!
This..
This is what uncle said.
How dare they!
- Yes.
Yes.
The Chaudharys will never change..
..their dressing sense for their 500 crores.
- Yes.
500..
- Crores.
Okay.
Okay.
We will wear up-to-date suits.
Yes.
- Yes.
Yes.
What is their second condition?
Their family is a joint family like in the movie 'Hum Aapke Hain Kyon'.
They all live together.
So is our wamiIy like in the movie 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham'?
We stay separately?
They have never seen you out on a lunch or a picnic..
..with your daughters and daughters-in-law.
- Enough.
They are womenfolk.
This tradition has been going on since ages.
This is what uncle said as weIl.
- What?
That the Chaudharys will never change their tradition for 500 crores.
Yes.
- 500 crores.
Fine.
Fine.
Listen.
Listen.
Henceforth, we'Il all be together.
tell me the third condition.
If I tell you the third condition then.. your pants will tear.
Pants?
- I am saying this.
I am saying this.
He had said something else.
tell me the condition.
You'Il have to cut it.
- What?
You'Il have to cut your ponytail.
- No.
Even uncle yelled and said no.
- Yes.
Yes.
But what can we do?
They hold the trump card of 500 crores.
500 crores. 500 crores.
Cut them, Amar.
You can always grow them back.
But you don't often get a harvest worth 500 crores.
Great.
Now you are looking that and that.
Bold and beautiful.
- Bold and the beautiful.
So tell us, brother.
What have you decided?
What have I..
What do you say, BaIlu?
Should I do that?
Yes?
- Do it.
Now that you have found a diamond..
..better set it in the ring.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Fine, then I'lI call my daughter and younger that tomorrow.
Brother.
- Brother.
Okay.
- Do you have relatives or brothers or something like that?
No.
He has an elder brother..
Name?
- Suraj Chaudhary.
In spite of having an elder brother..
..you have come alone to fix the alliance?
Where is he?
How can he come here?
We don't get along.
A house where brothers don't that..
- Get along.
Get long.
will their daughter go there?
- The Modis.
The Modis.
What he means is that their timings don't match.
He is sometimes out and he is sometimes in.
These two brothers love each other a lot.
Like..
Lord Rama and Laxman.
- Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So call them tonight.
Match the..
Timings.
- Timing.
Yes.
Consider it to be our that..
- Condition.
- Yes.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Don't hit my uncle.
What was the need to say..
- Sister-in-law, please, help.
That I have an elder brother?
I said it because you have one.
You could have said that he is dead.
You are strange.
How could say that?
Till date you haven't been able to kill him.
So uncle, how will you kill him?
But we are dead now.
That old man will never listen to us.
Hey, when God gave uncle a head over his shoulders..
..he didn't give it for decoration.
He will think.
He will think of something.
He will bring your brother by his ears.
Shut up.
Suraj Chaudhary will behead me even if I talk about it.
And if he doesn't come here then I'll behead you.
What?
Hey, let us go in.
Move aside.
Side.
Side.
Side.
- Who are you?
Keep distance.
Horn please.
May the face of the one with ill-intentions in his heart go black!
Seize the whole place.
Take everyone's mobiles.
Disconnect their phone.
Hey, who are you?
In this manner..
This is how we enter.
You have all the right to remain silent..
..as this is a raid.
I pay income tax thirteen times a year.
Yet there is a raid?
Sir, Ms. Sanjana.
Hello, uncle Mathur.
Hello, dear.
How are you?
Sanjana, you know these income-tax guys?
Aunt, they are not from the income-tax department.
They are from the World Bank.
I have heard of Punjab Bank and Allahabad Bank.
What is a world Bank?
The one outside Punjab and AlIahabad is called World Bank.
The father of all banks.
And the mother of all banks.
Uncle and aunt of all banks.
But, sir, what are you doing here?
Ms. Sanjana's father had taken a loan of 200 crores from our bank.
So?
- So he passed away before he could settle the loan.
So?
- He keeps on saying 'so'.
He will lose his mind when he will hear this.
So, we have seized all his property in America.
We have managed to get back 100 crores.
We still need to recover 100 crores.
But Sanjana doesn't hold any property here.
She came here to get married to me.
Fantastic.
After marriage a wife has equal right over the property.
Hence, according to law, we will recover 100 crores from you.
The bungalow itself must be worth 50-60 crores.
Come, let's go.
Let's go.
Mr. Lover, I knew that you would get this marriage canceled.
But what is this issue of 100 crores?
Should I tell you everything today itself?
What's the rush?
Where are you going?
You are here.
Polish them.
Balli, what kind of a law is this?
The law is according to the place.
Uncle, including this house and other things..
..you will manage to arrange 100 crores, right?
You, too, wouldn't want my deceased father..
..to owe a loan to anyone, right?
Listen, assistant.
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on, let's check the value of the property.
Okay.
- Again?
No.
actually I have some work with him.
Not now.
Okay?
Fine.
We will begin once your work is done.
Okay, ma'am.
How much work will you do?
You will get tired.
You..
- Everyone is standing here.
It's written in the scriptures, uncle..
..the more you work the better it is.
This girl will put me on streets to beg.
Now I got it.
Why did he break the alliance with this girl..
..and formed an alliance with K.K. Modi.
He knows that this girl has a loan over her head.
Balli.
- Yes.
Instead of us, you got K.K. Modi's daughter..
..alliance fixed into Amar's family.
If he has ruined it, he will mend it.
How?
- How?
You know B.K. Modi.
- Who is B.K. Modi?
You only had said that K.K. Modi has a younger brother.
Yes.
Yes.
He does.
He does.
K.K. Modi has a younger brother.
But what about him?
- His money.
What about his money?
You only had said..
That he is richer..
..than his elder brother when it comes to money.
- What?
Yes.
Yes.
I said so.
But what about him?
- His daughter.
Daughter.
- Daughter.
His daughter's..
mother will also be there.
What about his daughter?
You had taken the responsibility of getting her married.
Wow, Balli.
No matter what you say that's a great condition.
Not condition, connection.
- Whatever.
But tell him Mr. Modi's conditions.
Yes, ma'am.
Coming.
I'Il go and check the property.
I'Il see how much worth it is.
Darling BaIli, what conditions do these Modis have?
"Forgot tradition and became ready."
"If they get it right they will make it big."
"Money can make you do anything."
Amar!
- Brother!
Brother!
Where is your party?
Has gone to pickup your party at the airport.
Where did she come from?
Did you call her?
It feels very nice to see the two of you together today, uncle.
Now my problem is also over.
Now both of you decide who I should marry.
Dear, you should forget Veer.
Last night your mother visited me in my dreams.
And she said, "Veer isn't good enough for my Sanjana."
So the confusion is over.
I will get married to Yuvraj.
No, no, no, no, no, dear.
Yuvraj is absolutely useless.
Your mother visited me in my dreams as well.
She started crying.
She said, "Brother, don't ruin my Sanjana's life.
More tears.
What about me?
Will I stay single all my life?
- Not at alI, dear.
We, your uncles are there for you.
We will find someone good enough for you.
Nice, capable and decent.
We will have a grand wedding for you.
Why do you worry, dear?
We are there for you.
- Yes.
Okay, uncle.
Whatever you feel is right.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Meet him.
He's my younger brother..
B.K..
- B.K. Modi.
Yes.
Modi.
- Look who it is.
Ballu.
How are you, Ballu?
Hi, B.K. How are you?
- You look fit.
I think sister-in-Iaw's love has played its trick.
How is sister-in-law, Sakku?
She's absolutely fine.
She keeps talking about all of you.
How is B.K?
What is he doing these days?
- That's fine.
Mr. Modi, the girls didn't come with you?
To hell with the girls.
- What?
- What?
He means say hello to Naina and Sunaina.
Yes, they are the apple of their mothers' eyes.
Naina.
- Sunaina.
They both are great, aren't they?
Walk straight.
What are you thinking about, uncle?
What are you thinking about?
I couldn't recognize the other Modi as weIl.
Uncle, this means it's not an illness but an imagination.
You mean the character I think about, comes to life?
Yes.
You have the power.
Otherwise, how is it possible, uncle.
What will we call a person with such imagination?
We cannot call him human.
You mean I am..
God?
Brahma.
The Creator.
The creator of the universe.
Balli.
Look..
How they address God.
Idiots.
He has regained consciousness.
Now we will have fun.
Mr. Chaudhary, he is out of coma, but he is unable to speak.
How can he not speak?
Son..
Tell me, who was he?
Speak up.
Tell me.
Who was he?
tell me, son.
Try to speak.
Try.
Uncle, why is he pointing towards you?
Balli.
This means you..
No, sir. I cannot even put a comma to sentence.
How can I put him into coma?
Mr. Chaudhary, your son is still not out of coma.
His mind is spinning hence he is moving his finger here and there.
Look, now he is pointing towards him.
Mr. Chaudhary, your son's condition is so bad..
..that he might even point his finger towards you.
Oh, my.
The son is pointing towards his father.
please go out.
The patient is getting hyper.
Doctor, make my son get well soon.
Because the day he will come out of coma..
..someone else will go into coma.
Let's go.
There are so many sorrows in this world.
Your sorrow is so less.
You aren't able to say anything..
..because of your unconscious state.
And he cannot say anything even when he is conscious.
So sad is this and how bad is that.
Continue.
Sir.
No, sir.
Madam..
- Move back.
I don't care.
please sir.
Sir, please.
- It's not my problem..
..as to with whom Mr. Chaudhary..
..is having his breakfast and his lunch.
Mr. Chaudhary, I've been looking for you all over the city.
And you are having fun over here.
You are having parties.
I'm being pressurized by the bank.
I keep getting phone calls.
tell me what you want to do.
Mr. Modi, you are here?
What a pleasant surprise.
Hello, sister-in-law.
- hello, brother.
Sister-in-law, it seems like you have come here on a holiday.
No, brother.
Our daughters are getting that with the brothers-in-law.
They are getting married with the brothers-in-law.
Mr. Suraj.
- Yes.
Your brother-in-law Veer was going to marry your niece, right?
No.
Niece?
Who is his niece?
Here she is.
Sanjana.
She is a very nice girl.
Why do you want to get related to us instead of her?
actually, what happened was..
- For Sanjana's happiness.
Sanjana doesn't like Veer and that's why..
..Mr. Chaudhary cancelled the wedding.
Great people.
This is very that.
- Good.
- Good.
A very good thing.
But brother, it's wrong as well.
Look brother, there is a young unmarried girl in their wamiIy.
And they are getting their brothers-in-law married.
It is wrong, isn't it?
- True.
It is not so.
Mr. Chaudhary is looking for a suitable boy for her.
He will get her married as soon as he finds a suitable boy.
Take your time and find a boy.
We are here for four days.
Look, first Sanjana will get married then our daughters will.
But Mr. Modi..
- No ifs or buts.
Consider this to be our that.
- Condition.
- Our condition.
Yes.
- Another condition?
Don't worry.
All the four Chaudharys are charged.
They will do something in four days.
Great people.
People, everybody join me please.
"Whether you are a crescent or the moonlight."
"No matter what you are.."
"..
I swear on God, you are great."
Clap, everyone.
Great.
Brother, the Chaudharys might get a heart attack..
..listening to your conditions.
Brother has kept a condition of Sanjana's wedding.
- Yes.
But you'll have to give the idea that our Prem will be her groom.
This condition has been kept to give this idea.
Okay.
- But they are very dangerous people.
If they find out the truth..
There is one person who is very dangerous.
Lehri.
He is very smart.
But he has already said such a big lie..
..that now if he tells the truth, he will be the first one to die.
'Okay, so this is his family and not the Modi family.'
Mr. BaIidaan.
The poor thing is standing as a statue.
Fine, I will bring it into life.
Brother.
Brother.
Brother.
I have come here to tell you a secret.
Here he is.
Here he is.
You are doing pushups?
No, I'm pushing the ground down.
Keep quiet.
Keep quiet.
tell me, who am I?
Am I God?
Am I a human being?
Who am I?
You are the first God with has been made by this human being.
What not have you made me?
Now even I have forgotten who I am.
I have become the Aamir Khan in the movie 'Gajani'.
Look here.
Look at this.
You have no idea how difficult it is to write on your back!
Rascal.
You played such a big game with a genius like me..
..who has written such a famous book?
Give me the book, please.
Here you go, genius.
I won't let you win as long as I am alive.
What will I do?
Mr. BaIli, Mr. Chaudhary is calling you.
Go.
You have been summoned.
Yes.
Yes, I've put the ball in the hole.
I've learnt to play golf.
This is how we used to play marbles as weIl.
You are right.
- Greetings, sir.
Come.
Come, Mr. Balidaan.
Come.
- You summoned me?
We have known each other since ages.
Why don't we turn this acquaintance into a relationship?
I didn't get you.
Your nephew Prem and our niece Sanjana.
Let's get them married.
- No.
No, this marriage cannot take place.
- Why not?
You are a servant.
We are your employer.
You don't like the respect we are giving you?
Why cannot this marriage take place, uncle?
We are their loyal servants.
We have to pay them back in someway or the other.
Right, uncle?
- Don't touch me.
You see, the girl has a loan of 100 crores over her head.
That too of the World Bank.
Who will pay it back?
You?
- We will pay it back.
We are going to get millions from the Modis.
You can keep 100-125 out of it.
Not 125, only 100 crores.
The amount of the loan.
After that even if you sent your daughter..
..without any clothes on, we will accept her.
Great.
Right, uncle?
We accept it, don't we?
- Yes.
Sanjana, my child..
I accept this match, uncle.
Uncle, your teeth will break if you will grind them so hard.
Mr. Chaudhary, there is a problem.
This Lehri keeps saying that Sanjana..
..had eloped with a boy during her wedding.
If someone comes to know about it on my wedding day..
..then my uncle will be defamed.
Can you please take care of this Lehri, sir?
Go and find Lehri.
- Get him here.
Yes, Mr. Chaudhary?
- Who eloped with Sanjana?
This..
What is this that you are asking me?
I had shown you the photograph.
A lie.
You are lying.
He had eloped with Sanjana.
You are right.
He had eloped with her.
Forgive me, I had lied.
He is the one I had given a lift to.
Henceforth, this is what you should tell everyone.
Got it?
Are you happy now, Prem?
Yes, Mr. Chaudhary.
Mr. Lehri, you don't know what a big favour..
..you have done to my uncle and the Chaudhary wamiIy.
God will surely send you to heaven.
Congratulations, Balli.
You became their that.
What is it?
Yes, their relative.
Mr. Modi, you are the one who gave us this idea.
Otherwise, how could we ever think of this?
Have this.
Why did you unnecessarily take the that.
Trouble.
You go and have your meal.
- We'll all have together.
No, we don't know how long we will take.
Why should you stay that because of us?
Hungry.
Go, have your meal.
- Okay.
I love you.
That's great, Mr. Modi.
At your place the women eat before the men do.
At our place, till we do eat, the women will die but..
..not touch the food.
This is wrong.
Look, women live in a very that world.
Small.
It begins from and ends at us.
The house and kids.
She is that in them.
What is it said?
Yes, restricted.
Hence it is our duty to look after them.
We should love them.
We should always keep them that.
We should keep them happy.
Radhika..
What happened?
Nothing.
You have your meal.
Before you?
- So what?
If I drink all night along ill you stay hungry till the morning?
What is wrong with you, today?
Love.
I love you.
Sorry.
ShaIu.
ShaIu?
- Yes, Shalani.
Now I will always call you Shalu.
And henceforth, you can eat before me.
Why so?
- Because I love you.
Thank you.
Brother, Prem is nowhere to be seen.
Sanjana is not here either.
They got what they wanted.
The lovebirds must be busy at some corner.
Yes, so what is wrong in that?
They both that to each other.
They love each other.
They are going to get married.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Come, let's go and have some food.
Come on.
Look, Prem and Sanjana are also back.
Come on.
The bride and the groom are also here.
Let me make an announcement.
I have decided that this marriage won't take place.
What?
- What?
Once again uncle must have gone into the 100 crore loop..
..after having a little too much to drink.
Balli, what are you saying?
Keep quiet.
Keep quiet.
You are saying BaIli and sacrificing me
This marriage won't take place.
If uncle doesn't want this marriage to take place then..
Without uncle, I don't want to marry like an orphan.
Since when did you become an orphan, you liar?
Here he is.
Your father is here in a three-piece suit.
He is here.
Fine.
Fine.
Fine, Ballu.
If you are breaking your that with him.
Then I will form a that with him.
What is it?
Yes, a relationship.
Henceforth, I am your father.
And I am your mother.
I'm your uncle.
I'm your aunt.
If you are falling short of relatives then I, too, shall become one?
Why..
Why would you become anyone?
You are his uncle.
Keep it fixed.
Then it is fixed.
- Yes.
Henceforth, I am his uncle.
- And I am his aunt.
Look at that.
They all are telling the truth.
Chaudharys, can't you see the truth?
Brother.
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't do this.
Don't do this.
No matter how he is, he is my uncle.
My real uncIe. I'Il make him understand.
Uncle, you saw how many relatives I have now?
It won't make a difference if I have one uncle less.
Yes, uncle.
On one hand your final rites will be performed..
..and on the other my wedding ceremony.
Correct.
- But this wedding will surely take place.
Yes, so I will prepare for the wedding.
- Yes.

Someone stop me.
By the way, Prem..
- Yes?
Have you come here to show the necklace..
..your family has bought for her or to see Sanjana?
I had come to congratulate all of you.
This is the first love marriage taking place in your family.
Aryan.
You came from the hospital on the right day.
Come, I'll introduce you to Sanjana's future husband.
Don't you want to get ready?
- Ready?
Come on, go.
Go.
- I am ever ready.
Ask Sanjana.
Prem, look who is here.
He is the one.
He is the one who hit me with his car.
I went into coma because of him.
He was the one who eloped with Sanjana.
Look, Veer, Yuvraj.
Sanjana and Prem love each other.
That means everyone is a part of Prem's conspiracy.
I'Il take care of you later, you wrenched woman.
We will first..
..take care of you.
You are flying too high.
Do you love to fly?
Yes, we do.
- What will you do?
Nothing, boys. I'Il just help you fulfil your dream.
You..
Where shall I keep it?
We will have to tell brother-in-Iaw about his true identity.
fools, not the true identity, but a false one.
Never underestimate three things in life.
I, me and myself.
Thank you.
No one can deport the one who has the family's support.
I am someone who can drown a fish.
What can you three.. do to me?
Go, Veer.
Go, Yuvraj.
I'Il see how he stops you.
Let's go.
You are sleeping even after coming out of coma?
Do you remember your name?
Aryan.
- Aryan, go into flashback.
And see what I had done to you.
Where did he go?
- He left right in front of you.
Mr. Modi.
- Yes.
Mr. Modi.
- What happened?
We know the truth about that scoundrel Prem.
He is not Balli's nephew.
So?
- He isn't the real Modi either.
He is my real uncle.
A Kapoor.
Uncle.
- Yes, nephew.
Uncle.
- Uncle, catch them.
We'Il see you.
- We'll see you.
Prem, I'll go with you.
- You handle the ladies inside.
I'm a Modi.
I'm a Modi.
I'm a Modi.
Aryan.
Aryan, let's go.
Save us.
Save us.
One.. two.. three.
The keys.
The keys are with me.
Come here..
Come here..
That way.
That way.
Side effects of too much rajma chawaI (a rice dish).
Sorry.
O God!
Card.
Card.
- Thank you.
Call me.
No pee me.
Pee them.
Hey, stop peeing there.
Stop him.
Stop him.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go fast.
You are a dead man.
We won't spare you.
What's this new drama.
Bye-bye!
Amar.
Sanjana reminds me of our sister Shibani today.
Yes, brother.
Our Sanjana looks so happy.
I'm ready to go to the moon for her.
What?
Uncle, looking at her I feel that I won't even need..
..the almond flavoured milk.
Dad.
You know there is a that.
A custom.
Yes, but till date I've never got that of that custom.
A need.
You, too?
- Yes.
Stop this wedding.
Dear good people, someone stop them.
Aryan, you are back from the hospital.
But who did this to you?
That beguiIer, Prem.
We have been cheated in such a big way.
Why did you do this to us?
Why?
Mr. Chaudhary, this was Sanjana's mother's desire.
And there was a belief in her wish.
Her wish was that you two get Sanjana married..
..and give her your blessings.
And she believed that..
..you two brothers will unite because of this marriage.
That means you really made a fool out of us.
You cheated us with 500 crores.
That means he is not a Modi.
And they are your uncles.
Listen, you idiots.
That's what I've been telling you since so long.
But you didn't listen to me.
You didn't listen to me as well.
- Then tell them now.
No, you only tell them.
God sent you down here but He forgot to give you any brains.
You didn't change even after seeing the goodness in him?
But I have changed.
From now on I will be a true uncle to Prem.
Let me see who tries to touch my nephew.
Come on.
Coming.
Here you go.
You will touch my nephew.
No, I am here to give you a hand, sir.
- Okay.
Sir, being with them till date I have only washed cars.
Being with you, I am sure I will thrash a person or two.
Great.
Great.
- Come on, let's begin the thrashing.
We are the five good men..
..and you are the two evil uncles.
Hippo Amar Chaudhary, you will get crushed in their fight.
Come here.
fools, what are you waiting for?
Shoot them all.
We have come to attend the wedding.
We support love and not hatred.
Prem has changed us.
By giving double the money.
Let's go, hired goons.
Traitors.
Prem, you continue.
It's inauspicious to stop that in the middle.
That..
The wedding vows.
- The wedding vows.
Come on.
Let's go.
Priest, hurry up.
Otherwise, my father and the rest of them will get thrashed.
Come.
Can I hold it?
shall I start walking?
Come on, son.
Priest, please hurry up.
I'Il shut down your world Bank.
Fast.
Fast.
I'm safe.
No.
This will be fine, Choudhary.
This is too much.
Prem.
Prem, you can get another wife..
..but you won't get another father.
Today, for the first time a woman has said something sensible.
Go, Prem.
Prem, you won't get a better chance to remove your shirt.
Show your body.
- I won't.
Why?
- He has become fat.
Fat.
What shall I say?
Enjoyed it?
Mr. Chaudhary, I am here to form relations..
..and not to break bones.
Anyway, at our place we don't even look into..
..the eyes of senior citizens.
Raising a hand on them is a farfetched thing.
Hence, chill and relax, Mr. Chaudhary.
Chill and relax.
Saw that?
This is what is called good values.
But are miles away from it.
Yes, you only know the meaning of greed..
..selfishness and deception.
You didn't even bother about my mother, you deceased sister.
How low will you stoop for money?
My child is absolutely right.
On one hand this boy is making sacrifices for his future wife.
And on the other it's you guys..
..who since ages have been making your wives sacrifice.
I'm feeling ashamed..
..to call both of you my sons.
Shame on you.
Disgusting.
- Hey old man, have you lost your mind.
Father.
Get up, father.
- Father..
Don't you dare!
He is our wather.
I will cut your hand if you even touch him.
And I will break yourjaw if you misbehave with him.
He lied.
He cheated everyone.
And you are..
They aren't even Modis.
What difference does the name make, son?
A person is known for his deeds.
And then, when have we ever acted like Chaudharys?
We have instead demeaned the Chaudhary name.
They are the real Chaudharys.
No, we are very satisfied being Kapoors.
How can he be a Chaudhary?
He has made us fight.
Brother-in-law, we should take revenge from him.
Revenge for what?
We should seek revenge because he made us human?
We should seek revenge because..
..by changing relations he changed us.
We brothers have been enemies since ages.
But today when our father got hurt our hearts felt the pain.
Should we seek revenge for that?
We should learn from this family.
Just being a part of a family doesn't make you a dear one.
A member is a dear one when you accept him.
Sir.
Sorry.
Sir..
We hold our ears and say..
..that we will never act like goons again.
And we will never be greedy for money.
And one more thing, sir.
Mr. Modi, what is your original surname.
Kapoor.
Kapoor.
- Mr. Kapoor, please forgive us.
And accept us.
Let us be a part of this wedding along with our girl, please.
Madam.
- Chaudharys plus Kapoors equals to Chapoors.
Mrs. Chapoor.
Oh, my, Mrs. Chapoor.
Someone stop her.
Ready?
- Ready!

Wow!
The steamed potatoes have no steam in them.
And there is no saffron in the saffron sweetmeat.
Really?
What really?
I was just tasting them.
Look, what happened with all the tasting that you've done.
'That's Prem's uncle, Laxman Kapoor.'
'And his wife, Kiran.'
"I love you.
I love you.
I love you."
What is it?
You are dancing with joy.
Why?
- You didn't dance so much at our wedding.
I'm celebrating someone else's joy.
That was a suicide.
- Suicide?
My joy.
Does anyone dancing when he is happy?
Not suicide.
'That's Prem's uncle, Bharat Kapoor.'
'And his wife, Suman.'
Look, brothers, if there is that at that then that will happen.
What that and that will happen?
If there is lack of anything at the wedding..
..then we will get defamed.
- Okay.
Okay.
Don't worry, brother..
- Everything will be fine.
- Sure?
'These three brothers love each other a lot, like Ram, Laxman and Bharat.'
'And co-incidentally their names are..'
'..
Ram, Laxman, Bharat.'
By the way, where is my that?
That?
Liquor bottle?
- No, brother.
Not during the day.
It will ruin the wedding.
- No, it is taller than a bottle.
That..
That..
- The bride.
She is inside.
- Not the bride.
That..
That..
A child.
- How can there be a child when he is not married?
My child.
My child.
- His child.
Prem.
Prem.
Say that.
Where is that idiot?
- No, brother.
Don't call him an idiot.
This wedding is taking place because of him.
- Yes.
Khushi would have never agreed..
..if he wouldn't have reasoned it out with her.
- Right.
'Khaman Dhokla'.
- 'Khaman Dhokla'..
- Brother..
Gaurav had gone inside to meet Khushi for two minutes.
Half an hour has passed by.
Go and check what's happening.
The auspicious hour is passing by.
- Really?
'It is their friend and neighbour Mr. Pathak's daughter's wedding..'
'..whose name co-incidentally is Khushi.'
Khushi.
Khushi, my child.
Where are you?
Son-in-law.
Son-in-law.. what happened?
Who did all this?
Where is Khushi?
She ran away.
- She ran away?
She ran away with her lover.
- Lover?
Who is her lover?
Your neighbour, the Kapoors..
Their pampered, spoilt, rascal, scoundrel son.

Congratulations.
Thank you.
I was not in town.
If you wouldn't have helped her run away..
..her father would have got her married to someone else.
Yes.
And I would have become someone else's wife.
Not a chance.
Here's my card.
You are a registrar here.
We know.
No, no, no.
This is my other card.
I'm also a divorce lawyer.
I've dissolved more marriages than I've performed.
And looking at the two of you I feel..
..that you will definitely need me in future.
I know love is blind.
But marriage makes everyone see things clearly.
Do you see things clearly?
I'm still blind.
I've already married thrice.
I'm waiting to get married for the fourth time.
What kind of a man is he?
- Thank you.
Let's go.
Let's go.
We don't want your card.
Sir.
Sir, at least take the card.
Sir..
Who is he?
- He was getting married to her.
Look, brother, she was being forcefully to marry you.
And that's why..
- Forget it.
I was being forced to marry her.
What?
- I had come to tell Khushi that I love Kiran.
But I didn't get a chance to talk.
I was hit with a stick on my head and I fell unconscious.
I won't spare you.
- Brother, no..
Stop it, Gaurav.
Stop it.
We should thank them.
- Yes.
We wouldn't be together if he wouldn't have helped Khushi elope.
Say thanks.
Kiran.
- Hi.
How are you?
Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
Hurry up, the two of you.
Come here and get married.
I have to go and get someone divorced.
Let's go.
It's time for our flight as well.
We'll make a move.
Thank you so much.
- See you.
Take care.
Brother Prem.
- What?
Brother Prem, everyone inside..
Pathak shitting petrol.
Shitting?
- Seating sofa.
Oh, seating.
- Yes.
Okay.
You parking bike.
I'm seeing how much shitting.
He is here.
He is here.
He is here.
I'll set myself on fire.
I'll kill myself.
This drama has been going on since last night.
Neither is he sleeping nor is he letting us sleep.
Whenever he dries a little he wets himself again with petrol.
Mr. Pathak, if you wish to set yourself on fire..
..please do so outside, in the garden.
Why are you burning our house with you?
- Quiet.
Yes, exactly.
You heard that?
You heard that?
After ruining my family he is talking about his house.
Daddy, why don't you dive and snatch it?
Shut up.
You have done that.
- Awrong thing.
Awrong thing.
Yes.
- Stay away.
Stay away.
Stay away.
I'll set myself on fire.
Brother..
- Stay away.
Stay away.
Stay away.
Brother, Khushi is notjust your daughter but his friend as well.
Yes.
- Yes.
I'm sure she must have seen something special in Raju.
I'm sure the day you see them happy, you will forgive them.
That day will never come in my life.
And there are hardly any days left in my life.
Perhaps not even one.
Yes.
He is right.
He is right, right?
Then keep this aside.
I'll commit suicide.
- You..
I'll commit suicide.
- Who are you threatening?
I'll help you.
Does anyone have a lighter?
No, I don't have it.
This lighter..
- You started smoking?
- You started smoking?
Shame on you.
- Brother, I didn't..
Don't change the topic.
What were you saying?
I'll help you deep fry.
What are you doing?
Prem?
- What is this?
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Prem?
Prem?
Prem?
- Will Mr. Pathak's death affect anyone of you?
No.
- No.
- Will the world end?
What..
What..
What..
I will burn him down.
Okay.
I won't spare you.
I won't spare you.
- Prem.
Prem.
You'll ruin everything.
- Prem.
Something has to be done about this boy.
Hello, Guru.
Hello.
- Come.
Come, Ram.
Have a seat.
Have a seat.
Look, Ram..
- Yes?
Prem has done a good deed by uniting two lovers.
Guru, he ended brother and Mr. Pathak's age old friendship.
Yes.
- Prem that's the talks of his marriage even before it starts.
What is it called?
- Ends.
- He ends it.
Last month Guru sent a dog to your place, right?
Yes.
She is very nice.
- Yes.
She keeps everyone happy.
- Yes.
He sent two maids for household chores.
Naina and Sunaina.
They are very nice girls.
But cannot get Prem married to them.
- Right.
Right.
Similarly, Guru has found a bride for Prem.
Ram, listen to me.
You know the Malhotras from America..
Yes.
- Their daughter is perfect for Prem.
Yes.
She is a Bandit Queen.
A Bandit Queen?
- A Bandit Queen?
Phoolan.
- Only her behavior.
She is very good at heart.
Her name is Pooja.
- Wonderful!
She is the only girl who can change Prem.
Guru, then why are you doing that in this?
Why are you delaying this?
- Why the delay?
She is coming to Bangkok tomorrow for her friend's wedding.
It will be great if Prem likes her.
Whether Prem likes her or not..
..only Pooja will come to our house as that.
What?
- A bride.
- A bride.
A bride.
- Yes.
Hello.
- Karan, I've been trying all six numbers of yours since so long.
Tell me what happened to the wedding.
I ran away from the wedding.
But my passport is with them.
What?
It'll take at least 10-15 days to make a new passport.
But what will I do in the meanwhile?
They will find me.
I'll call you later.
- Hello!
Hello!
Hi, Pooja.
Do you need a ride?
No, thank you.
Prem and his uncle are coming to fetch me.
Prem, Pooja is coming at Terminal 3..
..why are we standing at Terminal 7?
That's the game plan.
- Why are you throwing it?
How will Pooja recognize us?
That's what I want.
She shouldn't recognize us.
Why
What are you doing?
What is this..
This.. is a proof for my father that we went to the airport..
..but Pooja Malhotra didn't come here.
So we came here..
- Uncle, tell me one thing.
Neither you nor I have ever seen her.
Nor has anyone in the family has seen her.
Guru has sent an imported Pooja Malhotra from America..
..so that she marries me and changes me?
- Correct.
Uncle, I need a very impish, roguish and talented wife.
Impish, roguish and talented?
But nowadays it's so difficult to find..
..an impish, roguish and talented wife.
All of them are married.
I am there.
But what will tell our Guru?
Let the Guru's mother go to hell.
Does he have a sister?
- Yes.
Then we shall send both of them.
- Okay.
Both mother and sister will go to hell.
Prem.
Who called me Prem so hatefully?
What did you think?
I will wait for you at Terminal 3?
And you will click a photograph here..
,and fool father?
- Pooja.
How did you recognize us?
Not you, him.
Daddy had given his description when I was leaving America.
I scanned the entire airport.
He was the only rogue with an innocent face.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
What an image you have, Prem.
I'm proud of you.
Why are you in a wedding dress?
What did you think?
I'll come from America in a two-piece bikini?
It would've been better.
- Just shut up.
Come on!
Let's go.
Excuse me.
Don't take advantage of the situation.
And don't you dare touch me.
Let's go.
Wow.
Impish, roguish and talented.
I should have asked for something else, uncle.
What better could have you asked for?
Think about it.
Ayoung and old imp at home.
And they will bet on who is more impish.
Your aunt and she will get along well.
Truly.
I'll bet on your girl.
They are here.
Pooja is here.
Pooja is here.
Brother, is she Pooja?
Or has he brought some other girl from her wedding?
You all must be surprised, right?
Seeing me dressed as a bride.
You see, a girl looks her best in a wedding dress.
So, I told myself, "Pooja, don't take a chance."
"If you want to impress everyone.."
"..then go dressed as a bride.
- Very impressed."
Impish.
Okay, tell me, how did you like our Prem?
Yes.
How did you like you?
I liked all of you a lot.
Very talented.
And if all of you support me then..
..we will change him for good as well.
Talented also.
- Okay.
Then all of us are with you.
Come in.
Come in.
Come in.
- Come in, dear.
She will change him for good.
She didn't bring any bags with her.
What was the need to bring any luggage?
I'm not staying in a hotel.
I'm staying with my in-laws.
There is anything lacking in here?
Yes, only that like you was lacking.
That..
What?
- What do you call a son's that?
Daughter-in-law.
- We were only lacking a daughter-in-law..
..and now your presence has changed that as well.
Your father has become that.
- Mad?
Should I tell your father?
You are saying such things about my elder brother?
Yes?
Tell us, when are you going for the wedding?
I just ran from a wedding.
You ran away from it?
But you were going to Phuket for your friend's wedding, right?
Yes, I was going to.
What do you mean, "I was going to?"
If you didn't go there then how did you ran away from it?
By ran away I mean I got rid of it with great difficulty.
Why would I unnecessarily waste my time in Phuket?
That's right.
Why waste time in Phuket?
If I would attend my friend's wedding..
..then how would I make arrangements for my wedding?
And I have to fulfil the responsibility Guru has given me.
She will marry you.
She is wishful-serpent.
I will never let her wish come true.
Sir, Pooja's on the line.
Pooja?
- Pooja?
It's for Pooja.
Give it to me.
Hello.
Hi.
How are you?
I'm standing at the airport since the last two hours..
..and you are asking how are you?
I'm not okay, understand?
My friend.
The one who is getting married.
She is very angry.
Anyway, look, I am waiting at the airport, come on.
And he didn't come to pick me up.
- Didn't get the time.
I have come here from America and he didn't get the time?
If you don't believe me then talk to Prem's dad.
I?
- Dad, she is calling all of you.
Tell her that you all are not free.
- Yes.
Look, we cannot come.
We don't have that.
Tell her that we don't have a car.
- No, we have a car.
The thing that moves like this.
Pendulum.
- We don't have a pendulum.
Excuse me?
- Time.
No, we don't have time.
Sorry.
Heard that?
Now do you believe me?
If you don't have time then even I am not stupid..
..to waste my time for you over here.
I'm going to attend my friend's wedding.
And I'll go to Guru's ashram after 8-10 days.
If you finally have the time and you wish to meet me..
..then you can come there.
Understand?
Okay.
That's a great idea.
Bye.
Come, Pooja, I'll take you to the guestroom.
Aunt, am I a guest that I'll stay in the guest room?
I'll stay in Prem's room.
In Prem's room?
- Before this?
Before marriage?
Until we get married, Prem will stay in the guestroom.
Yes.
Don't worry about him.
He can also sleep on a table.
Look, he is sleeping.
Ma'am, if you want to stay then stay in the guestroom..
..otherwise, I'll make you disappear in such a way..
Prem.
- Daddy, my room..
Uncle, cool down.
Now I am here.
I'll handle it.
Now look here, my future husband.
For now, I have just snatched your room.
After that I'll snatch your sleep and peace of mind as well.
I'll make you empty.
Empty.
You..
- No abusing.
Come, aunt.
Show me my room.
Go.
Go.
Show it to her.
- I'll be right back.
Brother, she will set him straight.
Isn't she very delicate?
- She is a lizard.
A lizard.
I don't know where that girl is.
I'm telling the truth.
You lost her.
My men couldn't find her.
Where did she go?
She doesn't know anyone in the city.
And no one knows her.
Where can she go?
Where can she go?
Where?
Where?
Hit him.
I want her at any cost before Suraj Chaudhary to her.
Someone stop me.
She is one piece from head to toe.
How do I cut her into pieces?
Prem, control your mind.
I'll control my mind but..
This girl with a face that looks a mix of banana and mango..
If you scream this Rampuri dagger will take to straight to Lord Rama.
You are taking advantage of the situation.
Situation?
Advantage?
Again?
She will yak and force someone..
..to think about it even if he isn't in the mood.
But what will you gain by killing me?
The CEO of fools, I won't benefit from it, you will.
I'll double your value.
- What?
How much is a live chicken worth?
- Rs.100.
And how much is a Tandoori chicken worth?
- 200.
So doesn't that double the value after death?
You will snatch my peace of mind?
You will snatch my room?
If you don't leave by tomorrow morning..
..then I swear by Baba Ramdev..
..I will kill you.
What happened?
- What happened, dear?
What happened?
- What happened?
What happened?
She must have had a nightmare.
She must have screamed.
A lot can happen in a nightmare.
Like..
Yes, a sneeze.
I was dreaming?
- Look, she is agreeing.
Come on, go back to sleep.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- She was dreaming.
Let us know if you need anything.
- Let's go.
Okay, goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Never underestimate three things in life.
Shucks..
Me, me and me.
Now you only bloody decide whether..
..you have to come to this house in a palanquin..
..or you want to leave this house.. as a dead person.
"Oh, Lord of the whole universe."
"Mighty Lord of the whole universe."
"All Thy devotees' agonies.."
"All Thy devotees' sorrows.."
"Instantly Thou banish."
"Oh, Lord of the whole universe."
Great.
I feel I am going to have a great day in office.
After all my day began with such a nice prayer.
You have been named aptly.
We are feeling as if we are in Hardiwar.
- Yes.
We have got such a nice daughter-in-law.
Dear, you are so cultured and you have such good values..
..in spite of living in America.
Bush taught Obama and Obama taught her.
So who is her mother is in America?
Obama?
Listen..
To celebrate Pooja arrival we will distribute that in the office.
That..
- Tennis ball?
No, not that.
- Paperweight.
'Ladoo' (Indian sweet).
Right, brother?
Yes. 'Ladoos'.
We will distribute 'Ladoo'.
We will distribute 'Ladoos'.
Yes, they are round as well.
The world is also round.
Should we distribute that?
- No, no, no.
What kind of people there are in the world, uncle.
Of different types.
They neither pray in the morning nor go to work.
Yes.
- True, dear.
There are such people as well.
What times have come!
There's a demon staying in a God's house.
I'll have to use my demonic mind.
Uncle.
- What happened?
What happened?
What happened?
- Nothing.
It's a small injury.
Should I seek revenge?
Here you go.
Mother Earth.
Bad mummy.
Bad mummy, Mother Earth.
- Sorry, uncle.
He was trying to make me fall but you fell instead.
But why was he trying to make you fall?
Anger.
I said a few true things and he got angry.
He got irritated.
Why get irritated with it?
She is telling the truth.
He is always either on his bike or his skates.
Otherwise he keeps building his body in the spare time.
Why are you ruining my healthy body?
Everyone is saying something or the other..
..don't you have to say something?
God sent him here to increase the burden on earth.
You are telling the truth for the first time.
We have been given a life..
..only so that he can disgrace us.
Absolutely right.
- He is a big disgrace.
You have a great sense of honour, uncle.
Even a Satan will look like a God in front of him.
Great.
- Wonderful.
He is..
- I think I'll have to tell aunt about your affair, uncle.
I'm not saying it from my heart.
Don't take it to your heart.
My hand broke.
- Be careful.
Be careful.
Be careful.
Take me to a hospital.
- We'll have to do something about her.
She's digging a grave for you.
What happened?
- I cannot move it.
I'll handle her.
Because uncle, once she is gone, life is fun.
Great, Pooja.
Great.
- Enough.
It is delicious.
- Fantastic.
- She cooks so well.
- Yes.
Outstanding.
Outstanding.
Yes.
- And she sings so well.
- Yes.
And she is also changing our spoilt brat for good.
- Yes.
Look, he is here.
Son, your name is Prem (love) and not 'Hatred'.
Right?
- Really?
Hey, listen.
Hello.
- Sit.
Madam, go.
Go to the airport.
Come on.
Why?
- Your father has sent a parcel for you.
From USA.
- Yes, so why are you giving me the news?
You should have collected it for me.
He is useless.
You sing so well.
You cook so well.
What would have happened if you had studied a little as well?
The officer there won't give the parcel to me without your signature.
You only will have to go there.
How will the poor girl go to airport alone?
You go with her, Prem.
Am I her driver, chauffer or servant?
Brother.
- Prem, you go with her.
Daddy, you are very that.
- I am very boring.
But still, you will go.
Go, dear.
Go.
Yes, but dad didn't inform me over the phone.
Oh, fax.
- What?
He has sent a fax, you dirty mind.
Why are you wasting time talking, Prem?
The parcel will go back.
Come on, leave.
Go.
Please go, son.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Be careful.
I think he's up to something.
I have a mobile.
I'll call if anything happens.
Only if he will let you call.
'I could've easily spent 10-12 days in this house..'
'..if he wouldn't have been born here.'
'She has made my family crazy about her in two days.'
'I would be dead if she would stay for 12 days.'
'He cannot stop taking advantage.'
'We take advantage of those we would gain something from.'
'I am just trying to get rid of her.'
'Airport is on the left and he is taking a right turn.'
'Is he planning to take me to the jungle and..'
'No, madam.
If I do any such thing..'
'..then I'll get stuck with you forever.'
'Then I will have to marry you.'
'Then why is he taking me to a jungle?
'
'Will he leave me amidst wild animals?
'
'I would have if I wasn't so concerned about the poor animals.'
'I think I'll have to show her a few lions.'
How can you even think of such a thing?
What are you doing?
Where are the keys?
- I threw it.
The steering wheel got locked.
Why did you throw it?
Are you a woman or what?
I'm a woman.
- If you are a woman..
..then you should have kept the keys here, like a woman.
Keys are not kept there.
Keys are kept around the waist.
To hell with your 26" waist.
I can see a six and a half foot grave there.
Move the steering wheel.
No, steering wheel has failed.
The steering wheel has failed.
Your mind has failed.
But the brakes didn't fail, right?
- No, they didn't.
Prem.
- She's gone.
- Prem.
Prem.
Prem.
Prem.
Where are you?
- I am here.
Down here.
She was hanging me, now God has hanged her.
Are you dead or alive?
I'm still alive, but I can die anytime.
Help me.
- Okay.
Take this.
Take my hand.
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come closer first.
No, I am thinking that it's better..
..if one person dies rather than two.
Coward.
Dastard.
Pansy.
Chicken.
Should I come there to help you so that you can help me?
Let me ask help for myself first.
Hurry up.
- Help me, God.
Give me your leg.
- You are already hanging.
How else should I hang you?
I mean give me your leg.
Leg?
Man and woman look good in pair.
But to touch something with ones' leg is a grave sin.
You are hanging on the branch with both your hands.
How will you save me?
Ma'am, each hand of mine has 2 times a gorilla's strength.
Depending on age and size.
By the way, I can save you with one hand.
Then Useless, use that hand.
Hold my waist and pull me.
No, no, no.
Not the waist.
Then you will say that I took advantage.
What?
- By the way your waist is..
Let my waist go to hell.
Hold whatever you want.
Do whatever you want.
But please save me.
In that case, come to me, my suitcase.
Look madam, you are taking advantage of my disadvantage.
- What?
If you come any closer, then I swear..
..I'll let go of both the hands and embrace you.
And both of us will be dead.
Please save me.
Let's go.
What are you doing?
Just hanging around.
Don't worry.
You women are amazing.
You cannot stick on to anything other than your age.
Sometimes you say take the advantage..
..sometimes you say don't take advantage.
What nonsense is this?
All your yakking is making me go crazy.
It was the demand of the situation.
I wasn't wrong to touch you now.
I was wrong to touch you earlier.
If this is not wrong then why is that wrong?
And if that is wrong then why isn't this wrong?
Actually, you are wrong.
It is wrong to sit here and talk to you.
It's of no use.
I'll lie down.
Obviously it's of no use.
I'm sitting and you are lying down.
It would've benefited if either, both of us were sitting or lying down.
Look, don't say double meaning things to me.
This is a limit to illiteracy.
Where is a double meaning in it?
Look, don't turn and sleep like this.
I feel something inside.
By the way, the jean fits well..
..on your waist.
My ill-fate I wish he wasn't a man.
And you weren't a woman.
Sanjana Singh.
Pooja has horns.
Prem!
'Prem.
Prem.
Prem.'
Isn't it a great place?
You call out once and it echoes back a number of times.
You have brought me here to hear this?
Oh, no.
This is nothing.
Now I'll shout your name and see what name echoes back.
Should I?
Sanjana!
'Sanjana.
Sanjana.
Sanjana.'
Hear it.
'Sanjana.
Sanjana.
Sanjana.'
I'm saying Pooja and it is echoing back as Sanjana.
Isn't it a strange place?
Look, the valley is so deep.
Prem.
- Only echoes come back from here, not people.
Tell me the truth.
Who are you?
Otherwise, I'll let go of you.
I'll tell you the truth.
Pull be back first.
Come on, start your story.
You already know my real name.
Sanjana Singh.
Actually, I had come from America to get married.
But the guy I was going to get married to..
..turned out to be a famous don's son.
I ran away from the wedding but they snatched my passport.
It takes at least 10-12 days to make a new passport.
I needed a place to hide as well.
Then I saw you at the airport.
You had come to pick up Pooja and no one knew Pooja.
So I thought..
You know the rest.
- I know the rest.
What did you do with the real Pooja?
I hope you didn't murder her.
No.
She has gone to attend her friend's wedding, in Phuket.
She will go to Guru's ashram from there.
Guru.
Guru.
Guru.
He is a..
Let's go.
Prem.
Hey, move aside.
"My heart broke."
"My heart broke."
"My heart went crazy."
I think you want me..
..to give you a lift.
You are very handsome and dashing..
..brother.
- Brother?
This car won't go anywhere.
It has broken-down.
Why?
What happened, darling?
Darling?
- The car will run.
It will get repaired.
I'm a mechanic.
It's my job.
Hope in.
Yes.
- But you didn't ask me where you should drop me.
I haven't caught you as yet, to drop you.
First let me introduce myself.
I'm Mr. Lehri.
I'm sure you know Bhappi Lehri.
There is no connection between us.
Yes, there is a connection.
He likes gold and I like to sleep.
Hello.
Why are you whistling?
You've already won over me.
Are you from Pataya?
Who is he?
Is he your boyfriend?
No, he is a distant friend.
- A distant friend?
Just like a distant relative.
Okay.
Then I have no problem..
..because I am shortsighted.
So shall we leave, Mr. Weak?
Hello.
I keep a person like you as my driver.
Really?
- Yes.
- Then give me the keys.
Come on.
The key is in its place.
I got a driver.
Come on, darling.
Come behind.
Come on.
Come on.
Watch your feet.
You aren't in the mood to come behind?
Not a problem.
We'll talk from here.
Great.
It's such a young and beautiful weather.
When I look at you I remember a romantic phrase.
Tell me.
Mingle in jungle.
I, too, remember a phrase when I see you.
A.K. Hangal in the jungle.
You know liquor and beauty have a deep connection?
I'm often intoxicated and the evening passes away.
There will be a day when the evening will be intoxicated..
..and you will pass away.
Hello.
I'm not here to get insulted.
Where do you usually go to get insulted?
Where will I go?
I stay at home.
I'm married.
You give a lift to a single girl even when you are married?
Who doesn't?
I only give, you take it as well, forcefully.
Watch out!
What is he doing up there?
Plucking fruits.
He plucked a lot of fruits.
Oh no!
- What have you done?
I didn't do it.
You did it.
Hard work paid off, didn't it?
You were driving very passionately.
Whose car is this?
- This is my car.
It's not a car.
It is my wife.
I love it.
If your wife has an affair with someone..
..then who will work hard on her?
Her lover, who else?
Who will enjoy it?
- My wife, who else?
Who will get punished?
- Me, who else?
So just imagine.
She is your wife.
Who was working hard on her?
- You.
Who was enjoying it?
- She was.
Who will get punished?
Me, who else?
Because it was my car.
Don't cry, my son.
Be strong.
The Lord works in mysterious ways, my son.
Have this fruit.
You are a Father?
Father.
Father, I had bad thoughts about her.
Father, I'm a sinner.
I've committed a grave sin, Father.
I am a sinner.
Hey!
Stop the car.
There's the girl.
What have I done!
- Prem, let's go.
They are his men.
Come.
- Come on.
Come on.
Fast.
Or she'll escape.
- I want to confess.
Where is that girl?
- Which girl?
The one who was standing here with you.
Your sister.
She..
Sister?
I think she ran away with brother-in-law.
Listen, have you seen our boss?
Who is your boss?
- Tall, board, huge man.
Okay, this..
What are you asking?
I'm selling these fruits here.
The fruits of hard work.
These fruits are very tasty.
Just taste them.
No.
I didn't.
My car hit him.
Get him.
- My car hit him.
Mr. Chaudhary, your son has gone into coma..
..because of excess blood loss.
I don't know when he will regain consciousness.
Quickly resuscitate him, Doctor..
..otherwise, I will sent you into coma.
Send me as well, sir.
To my home, sir.
Look, sir, it was my car but your son was hit by that boy.
I don't even now how to drive a car.
I swear on him.
Let him go.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
So sweet.
Yes.
Sir, I am leaving but before leaving..
..I would like to give you a small warning.
Sir, that boy is very smart.
He is fast, in driving cars and using his brain as well.
If he will come before you he will do such actions that..
..you will forget to give reactions.
Has anyone seen that boy?
Has anyone seen that boy?
I've only seen him from the left side.
And I've only seen him from the right side.
Sir, what is this left and right.
I've seen him from centre.
Will you be able to recognize him?
You are talking about recognizing?
Actually, I was born when I was small.
My mother was a woman.
And the person who murdered my father..
..underwent plastic surgery thrice.
Yet I recognized him.
Because he used to come to our shop to buy the plastic.
From now onwards, this plastic will always be with us.
Take him away.
- No.
This is wrong.
Shut up.
- This is wrong.
Find that boy and Sanjana.
Wherever they are hiding find them.
What?
- What kind of childishness is this, Pooja?
Is this a way to behave?
Does anyone hold and push anyone like this?
How was that?
- What did you do?
Like this..
Like this..
What did you do?
- What did I do?
You held her like this and pushed her like this.
The push she got had that.
The push she got had minimal effect?
- Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
Take your position.
- From there.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Come, come, one by one.
- Come on.
Come on.
Talk to your darling nephew.
- Yes.
From the time they have returned from the jungle..
..there is a lot of fun happening around.
"It is fun.
It is fun.
It is fun."
"It is fun.
It is fun.
It is fun."
Excuse me.
Just friends.
- Play the wedding tune.
Just friends.
Prem!
Prem, your method was wrong but your intentions were good.
Now I have no complaints against you.
- Mr. Pathak.
No.
No.
No.
My Khushi is so happy with Raju that I forgot all my sorrows.
Great.
Great.
Great.
- That's great.
You know I'm going to London.
Raju sent the tickets.
- Of economic class?
Yes.
- Yes.
How do you know that?
- Because I gave Raju the idea.
I told him not to buy first class tickets as you are such a miser..
..that you will be happy even with economic class ticket.
What happened?
- It got wet.
- What?
What is this, Daddy?
You always say double meaning things.
There is no double meaning in it.
The thing which we talk.
With which..
Mobile.
Mobile.
Mobile.
- Mobile?
My purse.
- My money.
My purse.
Your underwear.
Let's get out of this.
Today, I got that and after a long time that happened.
You got wet and fell in love?
No, I caught cold.
Today, the Sunday truly feels like a Sunday.
A Sunday will always be a Sunday.
- Yes.
We never go in the swimming pool together even if we want to, right?
Really.
- Thank you, Pooja.
- You're welcome.
Welcome.
Thank you.
I am Ready.
But there is a No Entry here.
Someone stop me.
Sir.
Ajunior priest has come from Guru's place.
He is here?
- Yes.
Make him comfortable..
- Yes.
The junior priest is here.
I'll go meet him and welcome him.
My wallet..
From the drawer..
That one.
Yes.
And the wallet..
Priest, why are you here?
I mean what brings you here?
I'll tell that later, but Guru is very angry with you.
Why?
- Why didn't you go to pick up Pooja from the airport?
I had gone there..
..but I got a little late.
She left to attend the wedding.
Yes, she will be going to the ashram directly from the wedding.
Be there on time to pick her up.
- As you say.
Where is everyone else?
- They are with Pooja..
But Pooja is..
- Not this one, the Pooja which was sent last month.
We sent a dog last month..
- Don't call her a dog.
The family members have named her Pooja.
They have named her Pooja?
A dog..
- Again you are calling her a dog.
Doggie, dog, puppy, pup, Raju, Tommy.
Nothing.
Call her Pooja.
Otherwise with a broom..
They are so madly in love with her that nowadays we eat dog food..
Dog..
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Pooja's food.
Pedigree and White Kennel.
So what should I call her?
Pooja?
Don't call her that if you want to lose your loincloth..
..and your honour.
Hello, Priest.
They are here to serve you.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Bless you.
Bless you.
Guru had kept a 'Satyanarayan' ritual..
- Very good.
He has sent the offering of that.
Sanjana..
As soon as they call for Pooja you come with the dog.
Tell me, where is Pooja.
She is here.
Pooja.
Now what do I tell you, Priest.
We have got very attached to Pooja in such a short span.
She is so sweet that as soon as she came, Prem..
She won everyone's heart.
'Oh God, what magic has this dog done in one month?
'
Our Pooja is as decent as she is beautiful.
'A decent dog?
'
'Have they lost their mind?
'
She is now our family member.
Does she bite?
What kind of a joke is that?
Is she a suckling that she will bite?
She is of marriageable age.
It's a different thing if she starts biting after marriage.
Whether she bites, scratches or does anything else..
..we have decided that she'll be the daughter-in-law of our family.
'They will make a dog their daughter-in-law?
'
'A dog will be perfect for you, son.'
'You deserve this.'
What are you thinking about?
That is happening with Guru's permission.
'Dandiya', 'Garba' (Gujarati dance forms).
No, no, no.
That..
That..
That..
Yes.
The alliance.
- The alliance.
The alliance.
'I think they have gone absolutely crazy.'
'They didn't go to pick up the Pooja Guru had sent..'
'..from the airport.'
'They have named their dog Pooja..'
'..and they are getting him married to her.'
'I'll also go crazy if I stay here any longer.'
I'll make a move.
Have lunch before you leave.
- Yes.
Pooja's favourite dishes have been made today.
'Oh, God.
They are feeding dog food to a priest?
'
Look, I..
You can have it.
I'm fasting today.
I'll make a move.
- Bye.
- Okay, Priest.
- Okay, Priest.
Who is this girl?
You don't recognize her?
You are strange.
She is our maid.
You had brought her here from the ashram.
'Look at that.
These lunatics think I am crazy.'
'I hope I really don't go crazy.'
Excuse me.
I'll make a move.
Okay.

Maids.
- Yes, brother.
Where is everybody gone?
Brother..
Gone ashram.
Meeting Guru.
And Pooja?
- Gone.. with them too.
Why, brother?
Heart beating fasting?
Brother, where are you running?
Come on, come on.
- Come.
This is Guru's that.
What is it called..
As..
Ashram.
We've come here to fix a wedding date for your marriage with Prem.
Yes.
Let's go.
You go ahead.
We'll come.
- Okay.
Pooja, it is believed that all wishes..
Come.
Which Pooja are you talking about, Ram?
Pooja has not returned from her friend's wedding.
Then who is the one who has been staying..
..in our house as Pooja since the past few days.
Who is the scoundrel you ran away with?
Kill his entire family.
How is that possible!
You want me, right?
I'm ready to come with you.
Let's go.
Come on.
Leave me.
Brother-in-law.
Sanjana is not here.
I knew that you would surely come.
And I, too, knew that you would say..
.."I knew that you would surely come."
Why should I come, huh?
Am I your boyfriend?
I love you?
- Saw?
You are agreeing to it.
No.
Really?
He's your uncle?
Yes.
Prem, how would I tell you that..
..these goons, mafias are my maternal uncles?
Great.
Your family members are like Charles Shobraj and Ranja Billa?
I love these mafia people.
Stop joking, Prem.
You don't know how much my uncles hate each other
My mother's last wish was..
..that I get both my uncles' blessings at my wedding.
So that their enmity ends forever..
..and they become good human beings like they were, earlier.
But?
- The greed of attaining my property worth 200 crores..
..increased their enmity.
Each one of them wants me to marry his brother-in-law.
200 crores?
I can draw a cheque without deducting the TDS..
..and keep your uncles in my pocket.
But my dear, until there are obstacles in a love story..
..it is not called a love story.
What stories will we tell our children?
Look, a boyfriend gets scared of his girlfriend.
A girlfriend gets scared of a cockroach.
A cockroach gets scared of a mouse.
A mouse gets scared of a cat.
A cat gets scared of a dog.
And a dog gets scared of a man.
- And a man is scared of a woman.
- What?
Just like a villain..
gets scared of the hero.
Prem, let's go.
My uncle is here.
What now?
They will..
- Don't worry, dear.
Today, I'll predict your future.
You will get married to an innocent looking rogue.
That's me.
Now can I take some advantage?
By the way, the fitting of the Indian dress is very good.
"Ready..
I am ready for you.
Are you ready for me?"
"Are you ready for me?
Are you ready for me?"
"Are you ready for me?
I am ready for you."
Uncle, Yuvraj was forcefully..
I ran away from there.
Sit in the car.
They are drying out.
This boy is making me that.
That..
Irritate?
- No, not irritate.
That..
This..
This..
Emotional?
- Emotional is like this.
This..
- So?
He is making me this.
This.
This..
Crazy.
- Crazy.
- Crazy.
He is making crazy.
Crazy.
Crazy.
He lied to me.
That girl is not this but that.
What..
- Not Sanjana, Pooja.
Pooja.
Yes.
Yes.
What you are thinking of doing is not so easy.
They are dangerous.
- Yes.
They are dons.
I would've said the same had I been in your place.
But.. what would've you done had you been in my place?
Why don't you make him understand?
What should I tell him?
All I know is that Sanjana is a very nice girl.
And right now, she must be in trouble.
She must be in big trouble.
That's true, sister-in-law.
But there is no solution to this problem.
I have such a solution that I'll make the lives of both the dons, hell.
They have a common CA, who has done BA.
And his name..
What was his name?
Sounds like bully.
- Idli (a south Indian snack)?
Mulli (Raddish)?
Pulley.
- Talli (drunk)?
No, close.
Close.
Khuli (open)?
Khali?
Khali.
Balli.
Balidaan Bhardwaj.
Sakku, how many times will you call me?
I feel that you call me even when you dial a wrong number.
What do I do?
You have left the house with so much cash.
I'm feeling scared.
This isn't the first time I'm out with so much cash.
I do transactions worth millions, day and night.
All 500 and 1000 denomination bills..
..across the world knows Balidaan Bhardwaj.
Then?
- That's fine.
But what if a thief stabs you and robs you?
Sakku, are you concerned about me..
..or are you trying to kill me?
Hang up, Sakku.
I want two demands drafts made.
One of30 lakhs and the other of20 lakhs.
Take this.
My bag?
My bag!
Where did my bag go?
Where is my bag?
There was 50 lakhs in the bag.
Where did the bag go?
My bag.
My bag got stolen.
Have you seen a thief here?
- No.
You blind man, you didn't see the thief?
.
You didn't even see such a big bag?
I didn't see it.
I'm not the owner of it.
You..
Have you seen your face?
It's so black that if shown on National Television..
..it will ward off evil from the entire country.
Sakku, what you said came true.
Sakku.
What happened?
Amar Chaudhary and Suraj Chaudhary's 50 lakhs got stolen.
What?
Don't do this.
Pack the bags.
It's time to leave the city.
Come on.
- Yes.
They are here.
Tell them I am not here.
I'll go and hide myself.
Mr. Bhardwaj.
Mr. Bhardwaj.
He has not only left this house but this world as well.
A trunk ran over him.
- Oh, no.
He got crushed.
Do you have anyone to look after you in this cruel world?
No.
By the way, I had brought this bag for him.
What will I do of this briefcase when he is no more?
Don't worry.
I'll take care of both his belongings.
Okay?
Let's meet after his final rites.
Bring it here.
Where are you going?
You are alive, sir?
- Yes, I'm alive.
It's her hobby.
She kills her husband over everything.
Start wearing a wedding chain from tomorrow.
People get mistaken.
She is mine.
And.. this bag is also mine.
There are only 50 lakhs in it, right, sir?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
There are only 50 lakhs..
Just a minute.
How did you come to know that there are 50 lakhs in it?
Just be looking at the bundle of the notes..
..I can predict how many notes it contains.
How?
- I learnt this art from my master.
Mr. B. B., sir.
Bishan Singh Bedi?
- No, sir.
Then?
Balibhrambhat.
- No, no, sir.
Bichun Bhutia.
Goal.
No way, sir.
The one who has written this book.
Mr. Balidaan Bhardwaj.
Be careful, sir.
I've written a book?
When did I write this book?
Such a fat book?
You?
- Yes.
Look at this.
The Balidaan in front of Bhardwaj is me.
That's me.
This is a sign of a genius.
You wrote a book and you don't even remember.
Sir, this book is a missile and you are an example..
..for a newcomer like me.
I have come to this city to be your assistant, sir.
I see.
- I want to learn the ropes of this job with you.
I don't want any money either.
- Then my job is done.
I mean your job is done.
- Thank you, sir.
I have only two clients.
Amar Chaudhary and Suraj Chaudhary.
Sir, they are mafias.
One is a mongoose.
And the other one is a snake.
If they get together then they are killer sharks.
But both of them are illiterates.
How many times during a year do you think..
..people like Chaudhary must be paying their taxes?
Sir, they must not even be paying the taxi fare.
Sir..
I make them pay tax every month.
Every month?
Again and again.
- Again and again.
12 times.
- 12 times.
Yes.
What do I do?
It is dirty but it is my business.
It is your business.
This is the only way to teach a lesson to those goons.
Sir, your name is Balidaan but you are making your clients sacrifice.
Now that you have joined me..
..everyone will be sacrificed..
with Prem (love).
Come with us.
Come with us.
- Why are you hitting me?
Come with us.
Come with us.
- Why are you hitting me?
Hit him.
Stop.
Stop.
Don't hit me.
Stop.
Stop.
I am your teacher, Amar Chaudhary.
Teacher?
You are a cheater, you scoundrel.
You give me a zero in the exams.
You gave the wrong answer.
What was the question?
Who is the president of India?
- Mrs. Prathiba Patil.
You had said that it was Abdul Kallam.
The president got changed.
It is my fault that the president got changed?
What do I have to do with when and where Alexander fought Porus?
Do I have to go there and dig their graves?
Hit him.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Well done.
You are doing well, Amar Chaudhary.
Saw that?
That's why I named him after me.
Amar Chaudhary.
Hey, Amar Chaudhary!
You stinky insect of a dirty sewer?
Mother, you go inside.
- Stop barking, you dog.
And let him go.
Otherwise I'll poison your food and feed you.
Got it?
Hey, go.
Take him back with dignity.
Go.
Yes.
- Go.
Let's go, sir.
Grandpa, you are being abused under his pretext.
No, no.
It's not so.
You are like a father to my daughter-in-law.
You are God.
A born leech.
- What?
He is.
This Amar Chaudhary.
It's time for school.
Don't you have to go?
Father, should I get something for you?
Yes, daughter-in-law.
Get some tea for me.
Okay.
- Without sugar.
And without poison.
Have some sweets, Mr. Chaudhary.
I got the land for your liquor factory cleared.
And it hardly cost you anything.
Only 50 lakhs.
Balli.
- Yes.
Don't you know you cannot bring strangers in here?
Who is he?
- He's my nephew.
Nephew?
- Yes, look.
We look similar, don't we?
You mean when I am of your age I will look like you?
Forget about the face, Mr. Chaudhary.
Talk about brains.
He is from America.
He will show your income so less..
..that you won't need to pay tax.
- Really?
You know the billionaire in America?
K.K. Modi.
He used to handle his account.
K. K. Modi?
- K. K. Modi?
Forget it.
Forget K. K. Modi.
Now that you are here you work for Mr. Chaudhary.
Handle his account.
Hire you nephew.
- Nephew!
Grandpa, it sounds like your business.
Ganja.
Balli.
- Yes?
You didn't teach your nephew how to salute?
Salute me.
What to get thrashed?
What did you say?
- No.
I saw my horoscope in the morning.
Yes.
- In it it's written that if I salute..
..anyone younger than me today..
..then he will get thrashed all day long.
But still if you want..
- No, no.
Let it be.
But I have read his horoscope.
Balli.
Come on.
- Let it be, today.
My nephew is with me.
So..
Balli.
Yes.
Now my hands feel warmer.
The apple of my eye.
My brave boy.
- Wild hippo, Amar Chaudhary.
Write 'Welcome' on your face.
You will look like a rotten doormat.
Anyway, your ponytail looks like a dead dog's tail.
Look at your grandpa.
It suits him so well.
Take this.
Stupid.
Go to school.
Yes, grandpa.
This is the first time mother has said the right thing.
The girls in my class tease me.
They said it looks like theirs.
With your permission can I chop it off?
.
Amar Chaudhary, you can have your neck cut but not your ponytail.
This is a warning, not advice.
We are samurais.
This is the identity of our family.
Your I.D. proof.
It is a voter's card, pan card.
Your blood group.
A proof that you are his grandson and he is your grandpa.
Where did this boring old man come from?
Great grandpa.
I saw you.
Today my day will go well.
Concentrate on your studies.
Kids of your age have gone places.
People of your age as well..
..have gone places.
"Happy days are over."
"Now I'm surrounded with sadness."
What is this, Mr. Lehri?
What are you doing?
I'm having black coffee with Obama in the White House.
Can't you see?
I hit the brakes to give you a lift.
Now my shirt has turned into a mop.
All this happened because of me, right?
I'm feeling very guilty.
I love you too.
Now it is my duty to get you out of here.
I also want to leave.
Because if my children grow up they won't recognize me.
And my wife is so nave that the poor thing..
..might once again run away with someone.
No such thing will happen because I have a mind-blowing idea.
This is the boy with whom Sanjana ran away, sir.
He doesn't look like he is from our city.
I'll find him even if he is hiding underground.
Are you telling the truth?
Sir, if I am lying he should die immediately.
No, I take his oath and say that henceforth..
..that that boy was not him but someone else.
Sir.
- What happened?
Sir, someone has come to meet you.
Balli, you got the land cleared for Amar for his liquor factory?
I just got the land cleared for him.
But for you along with the land I also got..
..the license for the liquor factory cleared.
Lehri, go.
You are free to go.
Mr. Chaudhary, I am leaving but before leaving..
..I would like to give you a warning.
Sir, this boy is very smart.
Only I know how he traps people.
You won't be able to anything to him..
..even if he comes and stands before you.
You do one thing.
You keep cleaning cars here till Sanjana's marriage.
Sir, what are you saying?
Sir, this is a crime.
It's a sin.
Mr. Chaudhary, you cannot do this.
Mr. Chaudhary can do anything.
He is Justice Chaudhary.
He provides justice to good people.
And he clears out the bad people.
Pick him and throw him out.
Balli, who is this boy?
He is a con.
C-O-N.
Con.
He joined hands with that girl and fooled me.
Which animal have I left out?
- You dog, clean the car.
Mr. Chaudhary, isn't the boy useful?
Once I start working, there will be no income and no tax.
No income tax.
But Balli, how is this possible?
This boy will work for Amar as well as us.
He has a habit..
..of doing two things together.
You know K.K. Modi in America?
He used to also handle his younger brother S.K. Modi's account.
But what if he turns out to be bad?
Then you can behead my uncle.
Behead me?
- Saw?
He agrees to it.
The thumb impression on the file.
Take it.
Just a minute.
Uncle, I was casually checking your accounts.
There are a lot of discrepancies.
What?
- There must be a slight difference.
21.
- 21..
Balli.
There is a difference of Rs.21.
Rs.21, dear?
It's hardly a difference.
Just a minute, uncle.
You are his assistant, right?
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on, show me the accounts.
Uncle, I'll go and check the accounts properly.
Yes, yes.
Okay, dear.
Hey..
Persuade her.
- Consider it done.
Balli, you saw how my niece's education is benefiting me?
Prem, this is not the right situation to take advantage.
Really?
Then promise me that you will meet me tonight.
And you will let me take all the advantages.
- Prem.
You..
You okay?
- Yes.
I was justjoking.
Balli, why do you look as if you've seen a ghost?
Our future daughter-in-law is checking everything, right?
Yes.
In detail.
Come with me.
Come with me.
Let them work.
Saw that?
My future wife is no ordinary girl.
Yes, I just came to know.
She has taken after me deceased sister.
So, your sister was also like her?
Then the entire family..
What happened?
He is getting scared.
- He fears he might get caught.
Sanjana..
Sanjana is not my daughter.
She is more than a daughter to me, Prem.
Her happiness means everything to me.
But..
But you don't know her uncles.
They..
- I know.
They are rogues from the Neanderthal times.
Orthodox.
I am a modern age dog.
Latest.
When we will fight, I will eat them up.
"I am a dog and she is my partner."
"I tell the truth, when she came.."
"..there came a season to eat everyone up."
Stop it.
Look, aunt, everything will be fine.
I promise.
What were you doing inside?
All that cuddling and all?
Uncle, she fell over me.
Girls from affluent families..
Hello.
Girls from affluent families are like that.
Try to understand.
Whether she falls on you or you fall on her..
..our necks will get cut and fall down.
Uncle, you only asked me to persuade her.
I got persuaded.
You would've got exposed..
..if she would've opened the accounts.
This is the first time I have let a girl touch me and you..
No, no.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
You are my disciple.
Come on, get in.
Get in.
Let's go.
Let's go.
"In 12 months I'll express my love to you in 12 different ways."
"Now I think I won't be able to survive.."
"..even for 12 minutes without you."
"When the winter season starts in January."
"We will switch on the heater of love."
"In a blanket as small as February.."
"..we will play hide and seek."
"March will be a romantic month."
"We'll do something we have never done before."
"What if we aren't able to meet in April?"
"What will happen?
Find a solution."
"I'll get an internet connection so that I can chat with you."
"When the summer season starts in May.."
"..we will party at the poolside."
"We will take a long vacation in June."
"We will go to a hill station."
"When starts raining in July.."
"..
I'll yearn to embrace you."
"We will have a lot of fun in August."
"We will make some arrangements."
"I'll take you to London.
I'll give you a tour of Paris."
"I'll take you on a world tour."
"I feel that I'll be coming often to your house in September."
"We'll see the sunsets together in October."
"You can keep your head on my shoulders."
"By the time the wretch November comes.."
"..you would've already surrendered your heart."
"Things will get confirmed on 12th December."
"With the confirmation from our hearts."
"There will be no car or mare."
"I'll bring the wedding procession on foot."
"In 12 months I'll express my love to you in 12 different ways."
"Now I think I won't be able to survive.."
"..even for 12 minutes without you."
Prem hasn't come as yet, dear.
Don't worry, aunt.
He will surely come.
Why don't you go and pay your respects..
..as you have come to the temple, Junior Chaudhary?
Tell me.
I prayed for a week before my exams.
He failed me.
- Then why have you come here?
I'm my grandpa's junior spy.
Whenever any female in the family goes out of the house..
..I keep an eye on them.
Whether they are going and meeting our enemies.
Aunt.
Go.
My child.
Bless you.
- That's enough.
Bless you.
Sister.
Someone stop them.
You are crying?
They are bound to cry.
These sisters-in-law love each other more than their own sister.
In spite of living in the same city we have met after ages.
Our men our fighting and we women are suffering.
I wonder when this will end.
Like I have united the aunts I will unite the uncles as well.
If I don't turn this family into a 'Hum Aapke Hain Kyon' family..
..then don't call me Prem.
Thank you.
Okay, so you are befriending our enemies..
..in the pretext of praying and worshiping?
Son, she isn't an enemy.
She is your grandaunt.
Amar, my child.
- Don't touch me, you old woman.
Scoundrel, if you say a word more..
..I'll feed you kerosene and light a match in front of your mouth.
Get out of here.
Forgive him, sister.
His grandfather has made him just like him.
I wonder when he will mend his ways.
Why are you laughing?
He will change, but I'm laughing..
..thinking of the way in which he will change.
Junior Chaudhary, the park is closed.
It's closed for others, not me.
Go and tell the manager, Amar Chaudhary is here.
The park will remain open.
Okay, sir.
- Okay, sir.
Come here, you animal.
Salute me.
The park should be closed now.
We have to go home.
You are refusing Amar Chaudhary?
Come here.
How dare you!
I won't spare you.
Go.
Who..
Who are you?
Badman.
Badman?
- Yes.
I'm here to turn a bad boy like you into a good boy.
You..
One kick and from Badman you will become a dead man.
Kick me.
Kick me.
Kick me.
Really?
Here you go.
Darn him.
I am sorry, bad-man.
Spare me.
Forgive me.
Okay.
From today, you'll be a good boy.
Yes, I will.
You won't bunk school.
- Okay.
You won't trouble your teachers.
You'll always respect your elders.
And you will cut your ponytail as well.
- Yes.
No, no.
This is not possible.
It is the identity of my family.
Shut up.
The kid has tired me.
First try to talk things out.
If they don't understand then kick them.
Great, Balli.
Great.
Your nephew is one in a million.
Amar Chaudhary.
Why do you have bandana on your head?
It's the latest fashion, grandpa.
Okay.
Okay.
Fashion.
Come here, my tiger.
And hit on this jackal's head.
Bless me, uncle Balli.
What are you doing?
Respecting my elders, grandfather.
This is what Badman has taught us.
Who Badman?
- He is our new teacher, grandpa.
Teacher?
Grandpa, his new teacher is Prem.
Dear, now I feel he'll also bring my two scoundrels back on track.
Hello
Uncle, uncle Suraj is once again trying to get me married to Veer.
What?
- Yes.
But I want to marry your son, Yuvraj.
Yuvraj?
- Please, uncle.
Please, do something.
Please, quickly get me out of here.
Someone is coming.
Come on, get the cars out.
Load your guns.
Let there be bloodshed?
We will have to bring Sanjana at any cost by this evening.
What are you doing, Chaudhary..
Sir.
Uncle, tell them.
What you are doing is wrong.
You are going to kill your brother for 200 crores?
Whereas someone worth 500 crores is in uncle's pocket.
Who are you talking about?
Uncle, I'm talking about K.K Modi.
Yes.
K.K. Modi from America.
Tell them how much he is worth.
He is worth 5000-7000 crores.
And hear this.
You know who has been given..
..the responsibility of getting his daughter Naina married?
Uncle.
Uncle, you couldn't see this gem of a person?
Whereas Naina desires a gem of a person.
They are such lovely people.
They are romantic.
They are going to kill their brothers.
Uncle, if I wouldn't have thought of this..
..then there would've been a bloodshed today.
Why don't you think?
No, the idea was on the way in my mind..
..but because of traffic..
Get this straight, Balli.
If we don't get this alliance then consider yourself death.
Get out of here.
I took K.K. Modi's name just like that.
You added his daughter to the story.
You added the responsibility of her marriage.
You added all the spices.
Sir, you told me all this..
after having a few drinks.
I told you about people who don't exist?
They exist, sir.
Listen.
- Yes?
Some K.K. Modi has called five times since morning.
He told me to remind you that he is coming..
..to India on Friday to discuss his daughter's wedding.
And yes, he has asked to book some resort.
Don't forget.
How is this possible?
Sir, this means you either have MP or UP.
Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh?
MP means memory power.
- Okay.
Sir, in this illness the battery of memory conks off.
Or UP that is unbelievable power.
Unbelievable power.
- Yes, sir.
In this the characters you think about come in real life.
I don't believe this.
That's why it is called unbelievable power.
Now you have to decide whether..
..it's your effective thinking or defective disease.
Meanwhile, sir, you have thrown me out of the house.
Bye.
Taxi!
- No, Prem.
I said that as I was worried.
Please.
Okay.
- Don't leave me in such confusion.
Okay, sir.
Tell me what I should do next.
There is no option or resort to this.
Yes, the last resort is that you book a resort.
Okay.
They have come?
Limo.
Ballu.
Ballu.
Uncle, go and welcome Modi.
What a pleasant surprise.
Come here.
Come here.
Give your friend a hug.
You have become fit.
I think it is the result of sister-in-law Shakuntala's that.
Love.
- Her love.
How is sister-in-law Sakku?
I hope you didn't have any that on the way.
What is it..
No, no.
One has to take some that for one's child.
Some..
Trouble.
- Yes, trouble.
Let's go.
Mr. Modi.
- Mr. Modi.
Stop.
Is this a way to ask for donations?
Mr. Modi, he is Mr. Chaudhary.
Avery famous L in the city.
- Landlord?
- Landlord.
- Landlord.
Mr. Modi, welcome, welcome, welcome.
Welcome.
Uncle Modi.
Aunt Modi.
Balli works for us.
Okay, Balli knows you.
That means he is our that..
Guest.
- Guest.
Guest.
Call him tonight for..
- Drinks?
Dinner.
Dinner.
And that as well.
Let's go.
Why are you staring at them with your mouth open?
Have you seen them for the first time?
Anyone will give that reaction on seeing Mr. Modi.
Sir, if you are a mouse then he is a cat.
If you are a cat, he is a dog.
If you are a dog, he is a fox.
If you are a fox then he is a lion.
If you are lion then he is an elephant.
If you are an elephant then he is a dinosaur.
Dinosaur of business, sir.
For your own good, come on time for dinner.
Otherwise you are a donkey, sir.
Who is going anywhere?
I am here till night.
Yes.
- Yes.
Let's go.
What happened, uncle?
He met me with so much affection.
He gave me a hug as well.
But I couldn't recognize him.
Is it an illness or my imagination?
Both.
- Both?
One personality is ill.
It is the imagination of the other personality.
The first and the second personality clashed..
..with each other and resulted in the third personality.
Spilt personality.
The fourth personality will be suicidal personality.
You will feel like committing suicide, uncle.
You are right.
- No.
I feel like committing suicide.
- No.
Yes.
- Don't do it, uncle.
- Why?
You won't remember that you have committed suicide, uncle.
So what should I do?
Uncle, now you have only one option left.
What?
- Believe that your personality with imagination is right.
You know him.
He is K.K. Modi.
- You recognize him.
I'll have to.
Otherwise, I'll commit suicide..
..and I won't even remember it.
So what's the use?
He is K.K. Modi.
Mr. Modi, we are not as rich as you are.
But we are well respected in the city.
Great.
- Yes, sir.
They are decent people.
Really?
- They have a lot of cars and are cultured as well.
So brother, tell us, how much loan do you want?
No, sister-in-law, I am..
Balli, tell them.
- What should I say?
Uncle, with your permission can I tell them?
- Yes, please.
Mr. Modi, he is his brother-in-law.
Yuvraj.
He has studied till the 8th grade.
The 8th grade.
Raise two more fingers.
Yes, the 8th grade.
He has studied till the 8th grade.
So?
He wants to marry your daughter.
- What?
Brother Ballu, you have brought such an alliance?
Have you seen their faces?
They look as if they have just come out of a jungle.
Right.
Will their daughter marry into this illiterate family?
The Modis.
They don't have any sense of that.
Fashion.
Nor do they know how to that.
- Talk.
To talk.
They look like that.
That..
Ape-men.
- Ape-men.
If you weren't my friend I would have done that.
Shot.
- Shot you.
Let's go..
- Sumitra.
- Sumitra.
Let's go.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- Okay.
You ruined their mood.
- Shut up.
Shut up.
You..
I'll blow your head with you, you scoundrel.
You fool, he isn't a scoundrel, you are.
Do you know who are you messing with?
You can only make scrabbled-eggs from an egg.
Mr. Modi can turn scrabbled-eggs back to an egg.
You have spoilt the whole game.
But it's okay.
Uncle is here.
He will think of something.
What will I think of?
.
I am totally confused.
Will you tell us what this is all about?
Why have you made us all wear sunglasses?
Excuse me for my language, grandpa.
But what do these Modis think of themselves?
They have kept three conditions for the wedding.
I told them that I won't be able to look into your eyes..
..after telling you those conditions.
And you won't be able to look at each other after hearing them.
He said, "Here, make them wear these sunglasses.."
"..and tell them the conditions."
Tell us.
Tell us, what their conditions are.
Basically the Modis have made..
..the tent of Chaudhary's lives stand on three sticks.
Condition No. 1.
They don't like the way you dress.
What are you doing?
They say that you look like a C-Grade movie's villain.
How dare they!
This..
This is what uncle said.
How dare they!
- Yes.
Yes.
The Chaudharys will never change..
..their dressing sense for their 500 crores.
- Yes.
500..
- Crores.
Okay.
Okay.
We will wear up-to-date suits.
Yes.
- Yes.
Yes.
What is their second condition?
Their family is a joint family like in the movie 'Hum Aapke Hain Kyon'.
They all live together.
So is our family like in the movie 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham'?
We stay separately?
They have never seen you out on a lunch or a picnic..
..with your daughters and daughters-in-law.
- Enough.
They are womenfolk.
This tradition has been going on since ages.
This is what uncle said as well.
- What?
That the Chaudharys will never change their tradition for 500 crores.
Yes.
- 500 crores.
Fine.
Fine.
Listen.
Listen.
Henceforth, we'll all be together.
Tell me the third condition.
If I tell you the third condition then.. your pants will tear.
Pants?
- I am saying this.
I am saying this.
He had said something else.
Tell me the condition.
You'll have to cut it.
- What?
You'll have to cut your ponytail.
- No.
Even uncle yelled and said no.
- Yes.
Yes.
But what can we do?
They hold the trump card of 500 crores.
500 crores. 500 crores.
Cut them, Amar.
You can always grow them back.
But you don't often get a harvest worth 500 crores.
Great.
Now you are looking that and that.
Bold and beautiful.
- Bold and the beautiful.
So tell us, brother.
What have you decided?
What have I..
What do you say, Ballu?
Should I do that?
Yes?
- Do it.
Now that you have found a diamond..
..better set it in the ring.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Fine, then I'll call my daughter and younger that tomorrow.
Brother.
- Brother.
Okay.
- Do you have relatives or brothers or something like that?
No.
He has an elder brother..
Name?
- Suraj Chaudhary.
In spite of having an elder brother..
..you have come alone to fix the alliance?
Where is he?
How can he come here?
We don't get along.
A house where brothers don't that..
- Get along.
Get long.
Will their daughter go there?
- The Modis.
The Modis.
What he means is that their timings don't match.
He is sometimes out and he is sometimes in.
These two brothers love each other a lot.
Like..
Lord Rama and Laxman.
- Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So call them tonight.
Match the..
Timings.
- Timing.
Yes.
Consider it to be our that..
- Condition.
- Yes.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Don't hit my uncle.
What was the need to say..
- Sister-in-law, please, help.
That I have an elder brother?
I said it because you have one.
You could have said that he is dead.
You are strange.
How could say that?
Till date you haven't been able to kill him.
So uncle, how will you kill him?
But we are dead now.
That old man will never listen to us.
Hey, when God gave uncle a head over his shoulders..
..he didn't give it for decoration.
He will think.
He will think of something.
He will bring your brother by his ears.
Shut up.
Suraj Chaudhary will behead me even if I talk about it.
And if he doesn't come here then I'll behead you.
What?
Hey, let us go in.
Move aside.
Side.
Side.
Side.
- Who are you?
Keep distance.
Horn please.
May the face of the one with ill-intentions in his heart go black!
Seize the whole place.
Take everyone's mobiles.
Disconnect their phone.
Hey, who are you?
In this manner..
This is how we enter.
You have all the right to remain silent..
..as this is a raid.
I pay income tax thirteen times a year.
Yet there is a raid?
Sir, Ms. Sanjana.
Hello, uncle Mathur.
Hello, dear.
How are you?
Sanjana, you know these income-tax guys?
Aunt, they are not from the income-tax department.
They are from the World Bank.
I have heard of Punjab Bank and Allahabad Bank.
What is a World Bank?
The one outside Punjab and Allahabad is called World Bank.
The father of all banks.
And the mother of all banks.
Uncle and aunt of all banks.
But, sir, what are you doing here?
Ms. Sanjana's father had taken a loan of200 crores from our bank.
So?
- So he passed away before he could settle the loan.
So?
- He keeps on saying 'so'.
He will lose his mind when he will hear this.
So, we have seized all his property in America.
We have managed to get back 100 crores.
We still need to recover 100 crores.
But Sanjana doesn't hold any property here.
She came here to get married to me.
Fantastic.
After marriage a wife has equal right over the property.
Hence, according to law, we will recover 100 crores from you.
The bungalow itself must be worth 50-60 crores.
Come, let's go.
Let's go.
Mr. Lover, I knew that you would get this marriage canceled.
But what is this issue of100 crores?
Should I tell you everything today itself?
.
What's the rush?
Where are you going?
You are here.
Polish them.
Balli, what kind of a law is this?
The law is according to the place.
Uncle, including this house and other things..
..you will manage to arrange 100 crores, right?
You, too, wouldn't want my deceased father..
..to owe a loan to anyone, right?
Listen, assistant.
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on, let's check the value of the property.
Okay.
- Again?
No.
Actually I have some work with him.
Not now.
Okay?
Fine.
We will begin once your work is done.
Okay, ma'am.
How much work will you do?
You will get tired.
You..
- Everyone is standing here.
It's written in the scriptures, uncle..
..the more you work the better it is.
This girl will put me on streets to beg.
Now I got it.
Why did he break the alliance with this girl..
..and formed an alliance with K.K. Modi.
He knows that this girl has a loan over her head.
Balli.
- Yes.
Instead of us, you got K.K. Modi's daughter..
..alliance fixed into Amar's family.
If he has ruined it, he will mend it.
How?
- How?
You know B.K. Modi.
- Who is B.K. Modi?
You only had said that K.K. Modi has a younger brother.
Yes.
Yes.
He does.
He does.
K.K. Modi has a younger brother.
But what about him?
- His money.
What about his money?
You only had said..
- What?
That he is richer..
..than his elder brother when it comes to money.
Yes.
Yes.
I said so.
But what about him?
- His daughter.
Daughter.
- Daughter.
His daughter's..
mother will also be there.
What about his daughter?
You had taken the responsibility of getting her married.
Wow, Balli.
No matter what you say that's a great condition.
Not condition, connection.
- Whatever.
But tell him Mr. Modi's conditions.
Yes, ma'am.
Coming.
I'll go and check the property.
I'll see how much worth it is.
Darling Balli, what conditions do these Modis have?
"Forgot tradition and became ready."
"If they get it right they will make it big."
"Money can make you do anything."
Amar!
- Brother!
Brother!
Where is your party?
Has gone to pickup your party at the airport.
Where did she come from?
Did you call her?
It feels very nice to see the two of you together today, uncle.
Now my problem is also over.
Now both of you decide who I should marry.
Dear, you should forget Veer.
Last night your mother visited me in my dreams.
And she said, "Veer isn't good enough for my Sanjana."
So the confusion is over.
I will get married to Yuvraj.
No, no, no, no, no, dear.
Yuvraj is absolutely useless.
Your mother visited me in my dreams as well.
She started crying.
She said, "Brother, don't ruin my Sanjana's life.
More tears.
What about me?
Will I stay single all my life?
- Not at all, dear.
We, your uncles are there for you.
We will find someone good enough for you.
Nice, capable and decent.
We will have a grand wedding for you.
Why do you worry, dear?
We are there for you.
- Yes.
Okay, uncle.
Whatever you feel is right.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Meet him.
He's my younger brother..
- B.K..
B.K. Modi.
- Yes.
- Modi.
Look who it is.
Ballu.
How are you, Ballu?
Hi, B.K. How are you?
You look fit.
I think sister-in-law's love has played its trick.
How is sister-in-law, Sakku?
She's absolutely fine.
She keeps talking about all of you.
How is B.K?
What is he doing these days?
That's fine.
Mr. Modi, the girls didn't come with you?
To hell with the girls.
- What?
- What?
He means say hello to Naina and Sunaina.
Yes, they are the apple of their mothers' eyes.
Naina.
- Sunaina.
They both are great, aren't they?
Walk straight.
What are you thinking about, uncle?
What are you thinking about?
I couldn't recognize the other Modi as well.
Uncle, this means it's not an illness but an imagination.
You mean the character I think about, comes to life?
Yes.
You have the power.
Otherwise, how is it possible, uncle.
What will we call a person with such imagination?
We cannot call him human.
You mean I am..
God?
Brahma.
The Creator.
The creator of the universe.
Balli.
Balli.
Look..
How they address God.
Idiots.
He has regained consciousness.
Now we will have fun.
Start that.
Mr. Chaudhary, he is out of coma, but he is unable to speak.
How can he not speak?
Son..
Tell me, who was he?
Speak up.
Tell me.
Who was he?
Tell me, son.
Try to speak.
Try.
Uncle, why is he pointing towards you?
Balli.
This means you..
No, sir.
I cannot even put a comma to sentence.
How can I put him into coma?
Mr. Chaudhary, your son is still not out of coma.
His mind is spinning hence he is moving his finger here and there.
Look, now he is pointing towards him.
Mr. Chaudhary, your son's condition is so bad..
..that he might even point his finger towards you.
Oh, my.
The son is pointing towards his father.
Please go out.
The patient is getting hyper.
Doctor, make my son get well soon.
Because the day he will come out of coma..
..someone else will go into coma.
Let's go.
Let's go.
There are so many sorrows in this world.
Your sorrow is so less.
You aren't able to say anything..
..because of your unconscious state.
And he cannot say anything even when he is conscious.
So sad is this and how bad is that.
Continue.
Sir.
No, sir.
Madam..
- Move back.
I don't care.
Please sir.
Sir, please.
- It's not my problem..
..as to with whom Mr. Chaudhary..
..is having his breakfast and his lunch.
Mr. Chaudhary, I've been looking for you all over the city.
And you are having fun over here.
You are having parties.
I'm being pressurized by the bank.
I keep getting phone calls.
Tell me what you want to do.
Mr. Modi, you are here?
What a pleasant surprise.
Hello, sister-in-law.
- Hello, brother.
Sister-in-law, it seems like you have come here on a holiday.
No, brother.
Our daughters are getting that with the brothers-in-law.
They are getting married with the brothers-in-law.
Mr. Suraj.
- Yes.
Your brother-in-law Veer was going to marry your niece, right?
No.
Niece?
Who is his niece?
Here she is.
Sanjana.
She is a very nice girl.
Why do you want to get related to us instead of her?
Actually, what happened was..
- For Sanjana's happiness.
Sanjana doesn't like Veer and that's why..
..Mr. Chaudhary cancelled the wedding.
Great people.
This is very that.
- Good.
- Good.
Avery good thing.
But brother, it's wrong as well.
Look brother, there is a young unmarried girl in their family.
And they are getting their brothers-in-law married.
It is wrong, isn't it?
True.
It is not so.
Mr. Chaudhary is looking for a suitable boy for her.
He will get her married as soon as he finds a suitable boy.
Take your time and find a boy.
We are here for four days.
Look, first Sanjana will get married then our daughters will.
But Mr. Modi..
- No ifs or buts.
Consider this to be our that.
- Condition.
- Our condition.
Yes.
- Another condition?
Don't worry.
All the four Chaudharys are charged.
They will do something in four days.
Great people.
People, everybody join me please.
"Whether you are a crescent or the moonlight."
"No matter what you are.."
"..
I swear on God, you are great."
Clap, everyone.
Great.
Great.
Brother, the Chaudharys might get a heart attack..
..listening to your conditions.
Brother has kept a condition ofSanjana's wedding.
- Yes.
But you'll have to give the idea that our Prem will be her groom.
Yes.
This condition has been kept to give this idea.
Okay.
But they are very dangerous people.
If they find out the truth..
There is one person who is very dangerous.
Lehri.
He is very smart.
But he has already said such a big lie..
..that now if he tells the truth, he will be the first one to die.
'Okay, so this is his family and not the Modi family.'
Mr. Balidaan.
Balidaan.
The poor thing is standing as a statue.
Fine, I will bring it into life.
Brother.
Brother.
Brother.
I have come here to tell you a secret.
Here he is.
Here he is.
You are doing pushups?
No, I'm pushing the ground down.
Keep quiet.
Keep quiet.
Tell me, who am I?
Am I God?
Am I a human being?
Who am I?
You are the first God with has been made by this human being.
What not have you made me?
Now even I have forgotten who I am.
I have become the Aamir Khan in the movie 'Gajani'.
Look here.
Look at this.
You have no idea how difficult it is to write on your back!
Rascal.
You played such a big game with a genius like me..
..who has written such a famous book?
Give me the book, please.
Here you go, genius.
I won't let you win as long as I am alive.
What will I do?
Mr. Balli, Mr. Chaudhary is calling you.
Go.
You have been summoned.
Yes.
Yes, I've put the ball in the hole.
I've learnt to play golf.
This is how we used to play marbles as well.
You are right.
- Greetings, sir.
Come.
Come, Mr. Balidaan.
Come.
You summoned me?
We have known each other since ages.
Why don't we turn this acquaintance into a relationship?
I didn't get you.
Your nephew Prem and our niece Sanjana.
Let's get them married.
- No.
No, this marriage cannot take place.
Why not?
You are a servant.
We are your employer.
You don't like the respect we are giving you?
Hello.
Why cannot this marriage take place, uncle?
We are their loyal servants.
We have to pay them back in someway or the other.
Right, uncle?
- Don't touch me.
You see, the girl has a loan of100 crores over her head.
That too of the World Bank.
Who will pay it back?
You?
We will pay it back.
We are going to get millions from the Modis.
You can keep 100-125 out of it.
Not 125, only 100 crores.
The amount of the loan.
After that even if you sent your daughter..
..without any clothes on, we will accept her.
Great.
Right, uncle?
We accept it, don't we?
- Yes.
Sanjana, my child..
I accept this match, uncle.
Uncle, your teeth will break if you will grind them so hard.
Mr. Chaudhary, there is a problem.
This Lehri keeps saying that Sanjana..
..had eloped with a boy during her wedding.
If someone comes to know about it on my wedding day..
..then my uncle will be defamed.
Can you please take care of this Lehri, sir?
Go and find Lehri.
Get him here.
Yes, Mr. Chaudhary?
Who eloped with Sanjana?
- This..
What is this that you are asking me?
I had shown you the photograph.
A lie.
You are lying.
He had eloped with Sanjana.
You are right.
He had eloped with her.
Forgive me, I had lied.
He is the one I had given a lift to.
Henceforth, this is what you should tell everyone.
Got it?
Are you happy now, Prem?
Yes, Mr. Chaudhary.
Mr. Lehri, you don't know what a big favour..
..you have done to my uncle and the Chaudhary family.
God will surely send you to heaven.
Congratulations, Balli.
You became their that.
What is it?
Yes, their relative.
Mr. Modi, you are the one who gave us this idea.
Otherwise, how could we ever think of this?
Have this.
Why did you unnecessarily take the that.
Trouble.
You go and have your meal.
We'll all have together.
No, we don't know how long we will take.
Why should you stay that because of us?
Hungry.
Go, have your meal.
Okay.
- I love you.
That's great, Mr. Modi.
At your place the women eat before the men do.
At our place, till we do eat, the women will die but..
..not touch the food.
This is wrong.
Look, women live in a very that world.
Small.
It begins from and ends at us.
The house and kids.
She is that in them.
What is it said?
Yes, restricted.
Hence it is our duty to look after them.
We should love them.
We should always keep them that.
We should keep them happy.
Radhika..
What happened?
Nothing.
You have your meal.
Before you?
So what?
If I drink all night along..
..will you stay hungry till the morning?
What is wrong with you, today?
Love.
I love you.
Sorry.
Shalu.
Shalu?
- Yes, Shalani.
Now I will always call you Shalu.
And henceforth, you can eat before me.
Why so?
- Because I love you.
Thank you.
Brother, Prem is nowhere to be seen.
Sanjana is not here either.
They got what they wanted.
The lovebirds must be busy at some corner.
Yes, so what is wrong in that?
They both that to each other.
They love each other.
They are going to get married.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Come, let's go and have some food.
Come on.
Look, Prem and Sanjana are also back.
Come on.
The bride and the groom are also here.
Let me make an announcement.
I have decided that this marriage won't take place.
What?
What?
Once again uncle must have gone into the 100 crore loop..
..after having a little too much to drink.
Balli, what are you saying?
Keep quiet.
Keep quiet.
You are saying Balli and sacrificing me
This marriage won't take place.
If uncle doesn't want this marriage to take place then..
Without uncle, I don't want to marry like an orphan.
Since when did you become an orphan, you liar?
Here he is.
Your father is here in a three-piece suit.
He is here.
Fine.
Fine.
Fine, Ballu.
If you are breaking your that with him.
Then I will form a that with him.
What is it?
Yes, a relationship.
Henceforth, I am your father.
And I am your mother.
I'm your uncle.
I'm your aunt.
If you are falling short of relatives then I, too, shall become one?
Why..
Why would you become anyone?
You are his uncle.
Keep it fixed.
Then it is fixed.
- Yes.
Henceforth, I am his uncle.
- And I am his aunt.
Look at that.
They all are telling the truth.
Chaudharys, can't you see the truth?
Brother.
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't do this.
Don't do this.
No matter how he is, he is my uncle.
My real uncle.
I'll make him understand.
Uncle, you saw how many relatives I have now?
It won't make a difference if I have one uncle less.
Yes, uncle.
On one hand your final rites will be performed..
..and on the other my wedding ceremony.
Correct.
- But this wedding will surely take place.
Yes, so I will prepare for the wedding.
- Yes.

"It destroyed all the hearts here."
"What my style has done today!"
"You made me lose my patience."
"I don't know when you had an effect on me."
"Your magic worked."
"Yes."
"Only you know how I became yours."
"I lost my sleep following your paths."
"What you said managed to fool me."
"I've lost it."
"For a moment or two, I became your guest."
"Everything you had has been sacrificed to me."
"I've lost it."
"I have lost my peace and my heart, too, suffered a loss."
"Look, what my style has done today!"
"Look, what my style has done today!"
"It destroyed all the hearts here."
"What my style has done today!"
"I've lost it."
"I've lost it."
"You always keep following me."
"You always keep following me."
"Beloved, please help me find it."
"I've lost my nose ring."
"Keep looking for it."
"I've lost my nose ring."
Someone stop me.
By the way, Prem..
- Yes?
Have you come here to show the necklace..
..your family has bought for her or to see Sanjana?
I had come to congratulate all of you.
This is the first love marriage taking place in your family.
Yes, of course.
Aryan.
You came from the hospital on the right day.
Come, I'll introduce you to Sanjana's future husband.
Don't you want to get ready?
- Ready?
Come on, go.
Go.
- I am ever ready.
Ask Sanjana.
Prem.
Prem, look who is here.
He is the one.
He is the one who hit me with his car.
I went into coma because of him.
He was the one who eloped with Sanjana.
Look, Veer, Yuvraj.
Sanjana and Prem love each other.
That means everyone is a part of Prem's conspiracy.
I'll take care of you later, you wrenched woman.
We will first..
..take care of you.
You are flying too high.
Do you love to fly?
Yes, we do.
- What will you do?
Nothing, boys.
I'll just help you fulfil your dream.
You..
Where shall I keep it?
We will have to tell brother-in-law about his true identity.
Fools, not the true identity, but a false one.
Never underestimate three things in life.
I, me and myself.
Thank you.
No one can deport the one who has the family's support.
I am someone who can drown a fish.
What can you three.. do to me?
Go, Veer.
Go, Yuvraj.
I'll see how he stops you.
Let's go.
You are sleeping even after coming out of coma?
Do you remember your name?
Aryan.
- Aryan, go into flashback.
And see what I had done to you.
Where did he go?
He left right in front of you.
Mr. Modi.
- Yes.
Mr. Modi.
- What happened?
Mr. Modi.
- What happened?
We know the truth about that scoundrel Prem.
He is not Balli's nephew.
So?
- He isn't the real Modi either.
He is my real uncle.
A Kapoor.
Uncle.
- Yes, nephew.
Uncle.
- Uncle, catch them.
We'll see you.
- We'll see you.
Prem, I'll go with you.
- You handle the ladies inside.
I'm a Modi.
I'm a Modi.
I'm a Modi.
Aryan.
Aryan, let's go.
Save us.
Save us.
One.. two.. three.
The keys.
The keys are with me.
Take it.
Come here..
Come here..
That way.
That way.
Side effects of too much rajma chawal (a rice dish).
Sorry.
O God!
Card.
Card.
- Thank you.
Call me.
No pee me.
Pee them.
Hey, stop peeing there.
Stop him.
Stop him.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Stop there.
Let's go fast.
You are a dead man.
We won't spare you.
What's this new drama.
Bye-bye!
Amar.
Sanjana reminds me of our sister Shibani today.
Yes, brother.
Our Sanjana looks so happy.
I'm ready to go to the moon for her.
What?
Uncle, looking at her I feel that I won't even need..
..the almond flavoured milk.
Dad.
You know there is a that.
A custom.
Yes, but till date I've never got that of that custom.
A need.
You, too?
- Yes.
Stop this wedding.
Dear good people, someone stop them.
Aryan, you are back from the hospital.
But who did this to you?
That beguiler, Prem.
We have been cheated in such a big way.
Why did you do this to us?
Why?
Mr. Chaudhary, this was Sanjana's mother's desire.
And there was a belief in her wish.
Her wish was that you two get Sanjana married..
..and give her your blessings.
And she believed that..
..you two brothers will unite because of this marriage.
That means you really made a fool out of us.
You cheated us with 500 crores.
That means he is not a Modi.
And they are your uncles.
Listen, you idiots.
That's what I've been telling you since so long.
But you didn't listen to me.
You didn't listen to me as well.
Then tell them now.
No, you only tell them.
God sent you down here but He forgot to give you any brains.
You didn't change even after seeing the goodness in him?
But I have changed.
From now on I will be a true uncle to Prem.
Let me see who tries to touch my nephew.
Come on.
Coming.
Here you go.
You will touch my nephew.
No, I am here to give you a hand, sir.
- Okay.
Sir, being with them till date I have only washed cars.
Being with you, I am sure I will thrash a person or two.
Great.
Great.
Come on, let's begin the thrashing.
We are the five good men..
..and you are the two evil uncles.
Hippo Amar Chaudhary, you will get crushed in their fight.
Come here.
Fools, what are you waiting for?
Shoot them all.
We have come to attend the wedding.
We support love and not hatred.
Prem has changed us.
By giving double the money.
Let's go, hired goons.
Traitors.
Prem, you continue.
It's inauspicious to stop that in the middle.
That.. that..
- The wedding vows.
The wedding vows.
The wedding vows.
Come on.
Let's go.
Priest, hurry up.
Otherwise, my father and the rest of them will get thrashed.
Come.
Can I hold it?
Shall I start walking?
Come on, son.
Priest, please hurry up.
I'll shut down your World Bank.
Fast.
Fast.
I'm safe.
No.
This will be fine, Choudhary.
This is too much.
Prem, you can get another wife..
..but you won't get another father.
Today, for the first time a woman has said something sensible.
Go, Prem.
Prem, you won't get a better chance to remove your shirt.
Show your body.
- I won't.
Why?
- He has become fat.
Fat.
What shall I say?
Enjoyed it?
Mr. Chaudhary, I am here to form relations..
..and not to break bones.
Anyway, at our place we don't even look into the eyes of senior citizens.
Raising a hand on them is a farfetched thing.
Hence, chill and relax, Mr. Chaudhary.
Chill and relax.
Saw that?
This is what is called good values.
But are miles away from it.
Yes, you only know the meaning of greed..
..selfishness and deception.
You didn't even bother about my mother, you deceased sister.
How low will you stoop for money?
My child is absolutely right.
On one hand this boy is making sacrifices for his future wife.
And on the other it's you guys..
..who since ages have been making your wives sacrifice.
I'm feeling ashamed..
..to call both of you my sons.
Shame on you.
Disgusting.
Hey old man, have you lost your mind.
Father.
Get up, father.
Father..
Don't you dare!
He is our father.
I will cut your hand if you even touch him.
And I will break your jaw if you misbehave with him.
He lied.
He cheated everyone.
And you are..
They aren't even Modis.
What difference does the name make, son?
A person is known for his deeds.
And then, when have we ever acted like Chaudharys?
We have instead demeaned the Chaudhary name.
They are the real Chaudharys.
No, we are very satisfied being Kapoors.
How can he be a Chaudhary?
He has made us fight.
Brother-in-law, we should take revenge from him.
Revenge for what?
We should seek revenge because he made us human?
We should seek revenge because..
..by changing relations he changed us.
We brothers have been enemies since ages.
But today when our father got hurt our hearts felt the pain.
Should we seek revenge for that?
We should learn from this family.
Just being a part of a family doesn't make you a dear one.
A member is a dear one when you accept him.
Sir.
Sorry.
Sir..
We hold our ears and say..
..that we will never act like goons again.
And we will never be greedy for money.
And one more thing, sir.
Mr. Modi, what is your original surname.
Kapoor.
Kapoor.
- Mr. Kapoor, please forgive us.
And accept us.
Let us be a part of this wedding along with our girl, please.
Madam.
Chaudharys plus Kapoors equals to Chapoors.
Mrs. Chapoor.
Oh, my, Mrs. Chapoor.
Someone stop her.
Ready?
Ready!
One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Ready.

'My name is Prem.
I was introduced to you in the end.'
Hello, Mr. Aasim.
- Hello!
'This is my family.
The people you see on the screen right now..'
'The gentleman is my father.'
'And the lady is my mother.'
'My dad has a terrible habit of.. what was it again..'
'Yes, of forgetting things.
Come, I will show you the proof.'
You are that.
- That?
Welcome to the wedding.
- Yes.
Come inside and keep that.
The gift?
- That.
No, no, no, that.
That.
Please have a seat.
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.
Welcome.
Welcome.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Wow!
The steamed potatoes have no steam in them.
And there is no saffron in the saffron sweetmeat.
Really?
What really?
I was just tasting them.
Look, what happened with all the tasting that you've done.
'That's Prem's uncle, Laxman Kapoor.'
'And his wife, Kiran.'
"I love you.
I love you.
I love you."
What is it?
You are dancing with joy.
Why?
- You didn't dance so much at our wedding.
I'm celebrating someone else's joy.
That was a suicide.
- Suicide?
My joy.
Does anyone dancing when he is happy?
Not suicide.
'That's Prem's uncle, Bharat Kapoor.'
'And his wife, Suman.'
Look, brothers, if there is that at that then that will happen.
What that and that will happen?
If there is lack of anything at the wedding..
..then we will get defamed.
- Okay.
Okay.
Don't worry, brother..
- Everything will be fine.
- Sure?
'These three brothers love each other a lot, like Ram, Laxman and Bharat.'
'And co-incidentally their names are..'
'..
Ram, Laxman, Bharat.'
By the way, where is my that?
That?
Liquor bottle?
- No, brother.
Not during the day.
It will ruin the wedding.
- No, it is taller than a bottle.
That..
That..
- The bride.
She is inside.
- Not the bride.
That..
That..
A child.
- How can there be a child when he is not married?
My child.
My child.
- His child.
Prem.
Prem.
Say that.
Where is that idiot?
- No, brother.
Don't call him an idiot.
This wedding is taking place because of him.
- Yes.
Khushi would have never agreed..
..if he wouldn't have reasoned it out with her.
- Right.
'Khaman Dhokla'.
- 'Khaman Dhokla'..
- Brother..
Gaurav had gone inside to meet Khushi for two minutes.
Half an hour has passed by.
Go and check what's happening.
The auspicious hour is passing by.
- Really?
'It is their friend and neighbour Mr. Pathak's daughter's wedding..'
'..whose name co-incidentally is Khushi.'
Khushi.
Khushi, my child.
Where are you?
Son-in-law.
Son-in-law.. what happened?
Who did all this?
Where is Khushi?
She ran away.
- She ran away?
She ran away with her lover.
- Lover?
Who is her lover?
Your neighbour, the Kapoors..
Their pampered, spoilt, rascal, scoundrel son.
Prem.

- He's ready as well.
Then sign here.
- Okay.
Thank you.
Take this.
Here you go.
Exchange the garlands.
You are now husband and wife.
Click a photograph.
Just a second.
Click it.
Click it.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I was not in town.
If you wouldn't have helped her run away..
..her father would have got her married to someone else.
Yes.
And I would have become someone else's wife.
Not a chance.
Here's my card.
You are a registrar here.
We know.
No, no, no.
This is my other card.
I'm also a divorce lawyer.
I've dissolved more marriages than I've performed.
And looking at the two of you I feel..
..that you will definitely need me in future.
I know love is blind.
But marriage makes everyone see things clearly.
Do you see things clearly?
I'm still blind.
I've already married thrice.
I'm waiting to get married for the fourth time.
What kind of a man is he?
- Thank you.
Let's go.
Let's go.
We don't want your card.
Sir.
Sir, at least take the card.
Sir..
Who is he?
- He was getting married to her.
Look, brother, she was being forcefully to marry you.
And that's why..
- Forget it.
I was being forced to marry her.
What?
- I had come to tell Khushi that I love Kiran.
But I didn't get a chance to talk.
I was hit with a stick on my head and I fell unconscious.
I won't spare you.
- Brother, no..
Stop it, Gaurav.
Stop it.
We should thank them.
- Yes.
We wouldn't be together if he wouldn't have helped Khushi elope.
Say thanks.
Kiran.
- Hi.
How are you?
Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
Hurry up, the two of you.
Come here and get married.
I have to go and get someone divorced.
Let's go.
It's time for our flight as well.
We'll make a move.
Thank you so much.
- See you.
Take care.
Brother Prem.
- What?
Brother Prem, everyone inside..
Pathak shitting petrol.
Shitting?
- Seating sofa.
Oh, seating.
- Yes.
Okay.
You parking bike.
I'm seeing how much shitting.
He is here.
He is here.
He is here.
I'll set myself on fire.
I'll kill myself.
This drama has been going on since last night.
Neither is he sleeping nor is he letting us sleep.
Whenever he dries a little he wets himself again with petrol.
Mr. Pathak, if you wish to set yourself on fire..
..please do so outside, in the garden.
Why are you burning our house with you?
- Quiet.
Yes, exactly.
You heard that?
You heard that?
After ruining my family he is talking about his house.
Daddy, why don't you dive and snatch it?
Shut up.
You have done that.
- Awrong thing.
Awrong thing.
Yes.
- Stay away.
Stay away.
Stay away.
I'll set myself on fire.
Brother..
- Stay away.
Stay away.
Stay away.
Brother, Khushi is notjust your daughter but his friend as well.
Yes.
- Yes.
I'm sure she must have seen something special in Raju.
I'm sure the day you see them happy, you will forgive them.
That day will never come in my life.
And there are hardly any days left in my life.
Perhaps not even one.
Yes.
He is right.
He is right, right?
Then keep this aside.
I'll commit suicide.
- You..
I'll commit suicide.
- Who are you threatening?
I'll help you.
Does anyone have a lighter?
No, I don't have it.
This lighter..
- You started smoking?
- You started smoking?
Shame on you.
- Brother, I didn't..
Don't change the topic.
What were you saying?
I'll help you deep fry.
What are you doing?
Prem?
- What is this?
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Prem?
Prem?
Prem?
- Will Mr. Pathak's death affect anyone of you?
No.
- No.
- Will the world end?
What..
What..
What..
I will burn him down.
Okay.
I won't spare you.
I won't spare you.
- Prem.
Prem.
You'll ruin everything.
- Prem.
Something has to be done about this boy.
Hello, Guru.
Hello.
- Come.
Come, Ram.
Have a seat.
Have a seat.
Look, Ram..
- Yes?
Prem has done a good deed by uniting two lovers.
Guru, he ended brother and Mr. Pathak's age old friendship.
Yes.
- Prem that's the talks of his marriage even before it starts.
What is it called?
- Ends.
- He ends it.
Last month Guru sent a dog to your place, right?
Yes.
She is very nice.
- Yes.
She keeps everyone happy.
- Yes.
He sent two maids for household chores.
Naina and Sunaina.
They are very nice girls.
But cannot get Prem married to them.
- Right.
Right.
Similarly, Guru has found a bride for Prem.
Ram, listen to me.
You know the Malhotras from America..
Yes.
- Their daughter is perfect for Prem.
Yes.
She is a Bandit Queen.
A Bandit Queen?
- A Bandit Queen?
Phoolan.
- Only her behavior.
She is very good at heart.
Her name is Pooja.
- Wonderful!
She is the only girl who can change Prem.
Guru, then why are you doing that in this?
Why are you delaying this?
- Why the delay?
She is coming to Bangkok tomorrow for her friend's wedding.
It will be great if Prem likes her.
Whether Prem likes her or not..
..only Pooja will come to our house as that.
What?
- A bride.
- A bride.
A bride.
- Yes.
Hello.
- Karan, I've been trying all six numbers of yours since so long.
Tell me what happened to the wedding.
I ran away from the wedding.
But my passport is with them.
What?
It'll take at least 10-15 days to make a new passport.
But what will I do in the meanwhile?
They will find me.
I'll call you later.
- Hello!
Hello!
Hi, Pooja.
Do you need a ride?
No, thank you.
Prem and his uncle are coming to fetch me.
Prem, Pooja is coming at Terminal 3..
..why are we standing at Terminal 7?
That's the game plan.
- Why are you throwing it?
How will Pooja recognize us?
That's what I want.
She shouldn't recognize us.
Why
What are you doing?
What is this..
This.. is a proof for my father that we went to the airport..
..but Pooja Malhotra didn't come here.
So we came here..
- Uncle, tell me one thing.
Neither you nor I have ever seen her.
Nor has anyone in the family has seen her.
Guru has sent an imported Pooja Malhotra from America..
..so that she marries me and changes me?
- Correct.
Uncle, I need a very impish, roguish and talented wife.
Impish, roguish and talented?
But nowadays it's so difficult to find..
..an impish, roguish and talented wife.
All of them are married.
I am there.
But what will tell our Guru?
Let the Guru's mother go to hell.
Does he have a sister?
- Yes.
Then we shall send both of them.
- Okay.
Both mother and sister will go to hell.
Prem.
Who called me Prem so hatefully?
What did you think?
I will wait for you at Terminal 3?
And you will click a photograph here..
,and fool father?
- Pooja.
How did you recognize us?
Not you, him.
Daddy had given his description when I was leaving America.
I scanned the entire airport.
He was the only rogue with an innocent face.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
What an image you have, Prem.
I'm proud of you.
Why are you in a wedding dress?
What did you think?
I'll come from America in a two-piece bikini?
It would've been better.
- Just shut up.
Come on!
Let's go.
Excuse me.
Don't take advantage of the situation.
And don't you dare touch me.
Let's go.
Wow.
Impish, roguish and talented.
I should have asked for something else, uncle.
What better could have you asked for?
Think about it.
Ayoung and old imp at home.
And they will bet on who is more impish.
Your aunt and she will get along well.
Truly.
I'll bet on your girl.
They are here.
Pooja is here.
Pooja is here.
Brother, is she Pooja?
Or has he brought some other girl from her wedding?
You all must be surprised, right?
Seeing me dressed as a bride.
You see, a girl looks her best in a wedding dress.
So, I told myself, "Pooja, don't take a chance."
"If you want to impress everyone.."
"..then go dressed as a bride.
- Very impressed."
Impish.
Okay, tell me, how did you like our Prem?
Yes.
How did you like you?
I liked all of you a lot.
Very talented.
And if all of you support me then..
..we will change him for good as well.
Talented also.
- Okay.
Then all of us are with you.
Come in.
Come in.
Come in.
- Come in, dear.
She will change him for good.
She didn't bring any bags with her.
What was the need to bring any luggage?
I'm not staying in a hotel.
I'm staying with my in-laws.
There is anything lacking in here?
Yes, only that like you was lacking.
That..
What?
- What do you call a son's that?
Daughter-in-law.
- We were only lacking a daughter-in-law..
..and now your presence has changed that as well.
Your father has become that.
- Mad?
Should I tell your father?
You are saying such things about my elder brother?
Yes?
Tell us, when are you going for the wedding?
I just ran from a wedding.
You ran away from it?
But you were going to Phuket for your friend's wedding, right?
Yes, I was going to.
What do you mean, "I was going to?"
If you didn't go there then how did you ran away from it?
By ran away I mean I got rid of it with great difficulty.
Why would I unnecessarily waste my time in Phuket?
That's right.
Why waste time in Phuket?
If I would attend my friend's wedding..
..then how would I make arrangements for my wedding?
And I have to fulfil the responsibility Guru has given me.
She will marry you.
She is wishful-serpent.
I will never let her wish come true.
Sir, Pooja's on the line.
Pooja?
- Pooja?
It's for Pooja.
Give it to me.
Hello.
Hi.
How are you?
I'm standing at the airport since the last two hours..
..and you are asking how are you?
I'm not okay, understand?
My friend.
The one who is getting married.
She is very angry.
Anyway, look, I am waiting at the airport, come on.
And he didn't come to pick me up.
- Didn't get the time.
I have come here from America and he didn't get the time?
If you don't believe me then talk to Prem's dad.
I?
- Dad, she is calling all of you.
Tell her that you all are not free.
- Yes.
Look, we cannot come.
We don't have that.
Tell her that we don't have a car.
- No, we have a car.
The thing that moves like this.
Pendulum.
- We don't have a pendulum.
Excuse me?
- Time.
No, we don't have time.
Sorry.
Heard that?
Now do you believe me?
If you don't have time then even I am not stupid..
..to waste my time for you over here.
I'm going to attend my friend's wedding.
And I'll go to Guru's ashram after 8-10 days.
If you finally have the time and you wish to meet me..
..then you can come there.
Understand?
Okay.
That's a great idea.
Bye.
Come, Pooja, I'll take you to the guestroom.
Aunt, am I a guest that I'll stay in the guest room?
I'll stay in Prem's room.
In Prem's room?
- Before this?
Before marriage?
Until we get married, Prem will stay in the guestroom.
Yes.
Don't worry about him.
He can also sleep on a table.
Look, he is sleeping.
Ma'am, if you want to stay then stay in the guestroom..
..otherwise, I'll make you disappear in such a way..
Prem.
- Daddy, my room..
Uncle, cool down.
Now I am here.
I'll handle it.
Now look here, my future husband.
For now, I have just snatched your room.
After that I'll snatch your sleep and peace of mind as well.
I'll make you empty.
Empty.
You..
- No abusing.
Come, aunt.
Show me my room.
Go.
Go.
Show it to her.
- I'll be right back.
Brother, she will set him straight.
Isn't she very delicate?
- She is a lizard.
A lizard.
I don't know where that girl is.
I'm telling the truth.
You lost her.
My men couldn't find her.
Where did she go?
She doesn't know anyone in the city.
And no one knows her.
Where can she go?
Where can she go?
Where?
Where?
Hit him.
I want her at any cost before Suraj Chaudhary to her.
Someone stop me.
She is one piece from head to toe.
How do I cut her into pieces?
Prem, control your mind.
I'll control my mind but..
This girl with a face that looks a mix of banana and mango..
If you scream this Rampuri dagger will take to straight to Lord Rama.
You are taking advantage of the situation.
Situation?
Advantage?
Again?
She will yak and force someone..
..to think about it even if he isn't in the mood.
But what will you gain by killing me?
The CEO of fools, I won't benefit from it, you will.
I'll double your value.
- What?
How much is a live chicken worth?
- Rs.100.
And how much is a Tandoori chicken worth?
- 200.
So doesn't that double the value after death?
You will snatch my peace of mind?
You will snatch my room?
If you don't leave by tomorrow morning..
..then I swear by Baba Ramdev..
..I will kill you.
What happened?
- What happened, dear?
What happened?
- What happened?
What happened?
She must have had a nightmare.
She must have screamed.
A lot can happen in a nightmare.
Like..
Yes, a sneeze.
I was dreaming?
- Look, she is agreeing.
Come on, go back to sleep.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- She was dreaming.
Let us know if you need anything.
- Let's go.
Okay, goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Never underestimate three things in life.
Shucks..
Me, me and me.
Now you only bloody decide whether..
..you have to come to this house in a palanquin..
..or you want to leave this house.. as a dead person.
"Oh, Lord of the whole universe."
"Mighty Lord of the whole universe."
"All Thy devotees' agonies.."
"All Thy devotees' sorrows.."
"Instantly Thou banish."
"Oh, Lord of the whole universe."
Great.
I feel I am going to have a great day in office.
After all my day began with such a nice prayer.
You have been named aptly.
We are feeling as if we are in Hardiwar.
- Yes.
We have got such a nice daughter-in-law.
Dear, you are so cultured and you have such good values..
..in spite of living in America.
Bush taught Obama and Obama taught her.
So who is her mother is in America?
Obama?
Listen..
To celebrate Pooja arrival we will distribute that in the office.
That..
- Tennis ball?
No, not that.
- Paperweight.
'Ladoo' (Indian sweet).
Right, brother?
Yes. 'Ladoos'.
We will distribute 'Ladoo'.
We will distribute 'Ladoos'.
Yes, they are round as well.
The world is also round.
Should we distribute that?
- No, no, no.
What kind of people there are in the world, uncle.
Of different types.
They neither pray in the morning nor go to work.
Yes.
- True, dear.
There are such people as well.
What times have come!
There's a demon staying in a God's house.
I'll have to use my demonic mind.
Uncle.
- What happened?
What happened?
What happened?
- Nothing.
It's a small injury.
Should I seek revenge?
Here you go.
Mother Earth.
Bad mummy.
Bad mummy, Mother Earth.
- Sorry, uncle.
He was trying to make me fall but you fell instead.
But why was he trying to make you fall?
Anger.
I said a few true things and he got angry.
He got irritated.
Why get irritated with it?
She is telling the truth.
He is always either on his bike or his skates.
Otherwise he keeps building his body in the spare time.
Why are you ruining my healthy body?
Everyone is saying something or the other..
..don't you have to say something?
God sent him here to increase the burden on earth.
You are telling the truth for the first time.
We have been given a life..
..only so that he can disgrace us.
Absolutely right.
- He is a big disgrace.
You have a great sense of honour, uncle.
Even a Satan will look like a God in front of him.
Great.
- Wonderful.
He is..
- I think I'll have to tell aunt about your affair, uncle.
I'm not saying it from my heart.
Don't take it to your heart.
My hand broke.
- Be careful.
Be careful.
Be careful.
Take me to a hospital.
- We'll have to do something about her.
She's digging a grave for you.
What happened?
- I cannot move it.
I'll handle her.
Because uncle, once she is gone, life is fun.
Great, Pooja.
Great.
- Enough.
It is delicious.
- Fantastic.
- She cooks so well.
- Yes.
Outstanding.
Outstanding.
Yes.
- And she sings so well.
- Yes.
And she is also changing our spoilt brat for good.
- Yes.
Look, he is here.
Son, your name is Prem (love) and not 'Hatred'.
Right?
- Really?
Hey, listen.
Hello.
- Sit.
Madam, go.
Go to the airport.
Come on.
Why?
- Your father has sent a parcel for you.
From USA.
- Yes, so why are you giving me the news?
You should have collected it for me.
He is useless.
You sing so well.
You cook so well.
What would have happened if you had studied a little as well?
The officer there won't give the parcel to me without your signature.
You only will have to go there.
How will the poor girl go to airport alone?
You go with her, Prem.
Am I her driver, chauffer or servant?
Brother.
- Prem, you go with her.
Daddy, you are very that.
- I am very boring.
But still, you will go.
Go, dear.
Go.
Yes, but dad didn't inform me over the phone.
Oh, fax.
- What?
He has sent a fax, you dirty mind.
Why are you wasting time talking, Prem?
The parcel will go back.
Come on, leave.
Go.
Please go, son.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Be careful.
I think he's up to something.
I have a mobile.
I'll call if anything happens.
Only if he will let you call.
'I could've easily spent 10-12 days in this house..'
'..if he wouldn't have been born here.'
'She has made my family crazy about her in two days.'
'I would be dead if she would stay for 12 days.'
'He cannot stop taking advantage.'
'We take advantage of those we would gain something from.'
'I am just trying to get rid of her.'
'Airport is on the left and he is taking a right turn.'
'Is he planning to take me to the jungle and..'
'No, madam.
If I do any such thing..'
'..then I'll get stuck with you forever.'
'Then I will have to marry you.'
'Then why is he taking me to a jungle?
'
'Will he leave me amidst wild animals?
'
'I would have if I wasn't so concerned about the poor animals.'
'I think I'll have to show her a few lions.'
How can you even think of such a thing?
What are you doing?
Where are the keys?
- I threw it.
The steering wheel got locked.
Why did you throw it?
Are you a woman or what?
I'm a woman.
- If you are a woman..
..then you should have kept the keys here, like a woman.
Keys are not kept there.
Keys are kept around the waist.
To hell with your 26" waist.
I can see a six and a half foot grave there.
Move the steering wheel.
No, steering wheel has failed.
The steering wheel has failed.
Your mind has failed.
But the brakes didn't fail, right?
- No, they didn't.
Prem.
- She's gone.
- Prem.
Prem.
Prem.
Prem.
Where are you?
- I am here.
Down here.
She was hanging me, now God has hanged her.
Are you dead or alive?
I'm still alive, but I can die anytime.
Help me.
- Okay.
Take this.
Take my hand.
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come closer first.
No, I am thinking that it's better..
..if one person dies rather than two.
Coward.
Dastard.
Pansy.
Chicken.
Should I come there to help you so that you can help me?
Let me ask help for myself first.
Hurry up.
- Help me, God.
Give me your leg.
- You are already hanging.
How else should I hang you?
I mean give me your leg.
Leg?
Man and woman look good in pair.
But to touch something with ones' leg is a grave sin.
You are hanging on the branch with both your hands.
How will you save me?
Ma'am, each hand of mine has 2 times a gorilla's strength.
Depending on age and size.
By the way, I can save you with one hand.
Then Useless, use that hand.
Hold my waist and pull me.
No, no, no.
Not the waist.
Then you will say that I took advantage.
What?
- By the way your waist is..
Let my waist go to hell.
Hold whatever you want.
Do whatever you want.
But please save me.
In that case, come to me, my suitcase.
Look madam, you are taking advantage of my disadvantage.
- What?
If you come any closer, then I swear..
..I'll let go of both the hands and embrace you.
And both of us will be dead.
Please save me.
Let's go.
What are you doing?
Just hanging around.
Don't worry.
You women are amazing.
You cannot stick on to anything other than your age.
Sometimes you say take the advantage..
..sometimes you say don't take advantage.
What nonsense is this?
All your yakking is making me go crazy.
It was the demand of the situation.
I wasn't wrong to touch you now.
I was wrong to touch you earlier.
If this is not wrong then why is that wrong?
And if that is wrong then why isn't this wrong?
Actually, you are wrong.
It is wrong to sit here and talk to you.
It's of no use.
I'll lie down.
Obviously it's of no use.
I'm sitting and you are lying down.
It would've benefited if either, both of us were sitting or lying down.
Look, don't say double meaning things to me.
This is a limit to illiteracy.
Where is a double meaning in it?
Look, don't turn and sleep like this.
I feel something inside.
By the way, the jean fits well..
..on your waist.
My ill-fate I wish he wasn't a man.
And you weren't a woman.
Sanjana Singh.
Pooja has horns.
Prem!
'Prem.
Prem.
Prem.'
Isn't it a great place?
You call out once and it echoes back a number of times.
You have brought me here to hear this?
Oh, no.
This is nothing.
Now I'll shout your name and see what name echoes back.
Should I?
Sanjana!
'Sanjana.
Sanjana.
Sanjana.'
Hear it.
'Sanjana.
Sanjana.
Sanjana.'
I'm saying Pooja and it is echoing back as Sanjana.
Isn't it a strange place?
Look, the valley is so deep.
Prem.
- Only echoes come back from here, not people.
Tell me the truth.
Who are you?
Otherwise, I'll let go of you.
I'll tell you the truth.
Pull be back first.
Come on, start your story.
You already know my real name.
Sanjana Singh.
Actually, I had come from America to get married.
But the guy I was going to get married to..
..turned out to be a famous don's son.
I ran away from the wedding but they snatched my passport.
It takes at least 10-12 days to make a new passport.
I needed a place to hide as well.
Then I saw you at the airport.
You had come to pick up Pooja and no one knew Pooja.
So I thought..
You know the rest.
- I know the rest.
What did you do with the real Pooja?
I hope you didn't murder her.
No.
She has gone to attend her friend's wedding, in Phuket.
She will go to Guru's ashram from there.
Guru.
Guru.
Guru.
He is a..
Let's go.
Prem.
Hey, move aside.
"My heart broke."
"My heart broke."
"My heart went crazy."
I think you want me..
..to give you a lift.
You are very handsome and dashing..
..brother.
- Brother?
This car won't go anywhere.
It has broken-down.
Why?
What happened, darling?
Darling?
- The car will run.
It will get repaired.
I'm a mechanic.
It's my job.
Hope in.
Yes.
- But you didn't ask me where you should drop me.
I haven't caught you as yet, to drop you.
First let me introduce myself.
I'm Mr. Lehri.
I'm sure you know Bhappi Lehri.
There is no connection between us.
Yes, there is a connection.
He likes gold and I like to sleep.
Hello.
Why are you whistling?
You've already won over me.
Are you from Pataya?
Who is he?
Is he your boyfriend?
No, he is a distant friend.
- A distant friend?
Just like a distant relative.
Okay.
Then I have no problem..
..because I am shortsighted.
So shall we leave, Mr. Weak?
Hello.
I keep a person like you as my driver.
Really?
- Yes.
- Then give me the keys.
Come on.
The key is in its place.
I got a driver.
Come on, darling.
Come behind.
Come on.
Come on.
Watch your feet.
You aren't in the mood to come behind?
Not a problem.
We'll talk from here.
Great.
It's such a young and beautiful weather.
When I look at you I remember a romantic phrase.
Tell me.
Mingle in jungle.
I, too, remember a phrase when I see you.
A.K. Hangal in the jungle.
You know liquor and beauty have a deep connection?
I'm often intoxicated and the evening passes away.
There will be a day when the evening will be intoxicated..
..and you will pass away.
Hello.
I'm not here to get insulted.
Where do you usually go to get insulted?
Where will I go?
I stay at home.
I'm married.
You give a lift to a single girl even when you are married?
Who doesn't?
I only give, you take it as well, forcefully.
Watch out!
What is he doing up there?
Plucking fruits.
He plucked a lot of fruits.
Oh no!
- What have you done?
I didn't do it.
You did it.
Hard work paid off, didn't it?
You were driving very passionately.
Whose car is this?
- This is my car.
It's not a car.
It is my wife.
I love it.
If your wife has an affair with someone..
..then who will work hard on her?
Her lover, who else?
Who will enjoy it?
- My wife, who else?
Who will get punished?
- Me, who else?
So just imagine.
She is your wife.
Who was working hard on her?
- You.
Who was enjoying it?
- She was.
Who will get punished?
Me, who else?
Because it was my car.
Don't cry, my son.
Be strong.
The Lord works in mysterious ways, my son.
Have this fruit.
You are a Father?
Father.
Father, I had bad thoughts about her.
Father, I'm a sinner.
I've committed a grave sin, Father.
I am a sinner.
Hey!
Stop the car.
There's the girl.
What have I done!
- Prem, let's go.
They are his men.
Come.
- Come on.
Come on.
Fast.
Or she'll escape.
- I want to confess.
Where is that girl?
- Which girl?
The one who was standing here with you.
Your sister.
She..
Sister?
I think she ran away with brother-in-law.
Listen, have you seen our boss?
Who is your boss?
- Tall, board, huge man.
Okay, this..
What are you asking?
I'm selling these fruits here.
The fruits of hard work.
These fruits are very tasty.
Just taste them.
No.
I didn't.
My car hit him.
Get him.
- My car hit him.
Mr. Chaudhary, your son has gone into coma..
..because of excess blood loss.
I don't know when he will regain consciousness.
Quickly resuscitate him, Doctor..
..otherwise, I will sent you into coma.
Send me as well, sir.
To my home, sir.
Look, sir, it was my car but your son was hit by that boy.
I don't even now how to drive a car.
I swear on him.
Let him go.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
So sweet.
Yes.
Sir, I am leaving but before leaving..
..I would like to give you a small warning.
Sir, that boy is very smart.
He is fast, in driving cars and using his brain as well.
If he will come before you he will do such actions that..
..you will forget to give reactions.
Has anyone seen that boy?
Has anyone seen that boy?
I've only seen him from the left side.
And I've only seen him from the right side.
Sir, what is this left and right.
I've seen him from centre.
Will you be able to recognize him?
You are talking about recognizing?
Actually, I was born when I was small.
My mother was a woman.
And the person who murdered my father..
..underwent plastic surgery thrice.
Yet I recognized him.
Because he used to come to our shop to buy the plastic.
From now onwards, this plastic will always be with us.
Take him away.
- No.
This is wrong.
Shut up.
- This is wrong.
Find that boy and Sanjana.
Wherever they are hiding find them.
What?
- What kind of childishness is this, Pooja?
Is this a way to behave?
Does anyone hold and push anyone like this?
How was that?
- What did you do?
Like this..
Like this..
What did you do?
- What did I do?
You held her like this and pushed her like this.
The push she got had that.
The push she got had minimal effect?
- Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
Take your position.
- From there.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Come, come, one by one.
- Come on.
Come on.
Talk to your darling nephew.
- Yes.
From the time they have returned from the jungle..
..there is a lot of fun happening around.
"It is fun.
It is fun.
It is fun."
"It is fun.
It is fun.
It is fun."
Excuse me.
Just friends.
- Play the wedding tune.
Just friends.
Prem!
Prem, your method was wrong but your intentions were good.
Now I have no complaints against you.
- Mr. Pathak.
No.
No.
No.
My Khushi is so happy with Raju that I forgot all my sorrows.
Great.
Great.
Great.
- That's great.
You know I'm going to London.
Raju sent the tickets.
- Of economic class?
Yes.
- Yes.
How do you know that?
- Because I gave Raju the idea.
I told him not to buy first class tickets as you are such a miser..
..that you will be happy even with economic class ticket.
What happened?
- It got wet.
- What?
What is this, Daddy?
You always say double meaning things.
There is no double meaning in it.
The thing which we talk.
With which..
Mobile.
Mobile.
Mobile.
- Mobile?
My purse.
- My money.
My purse.
Your underwear.
Let's get out of this.
Today, I got that and after a long time that happened.
You got wet and fell in love?
No, I caught cold.
Today, the Sunday truly feels like a Sunday.
A Sunday will always be a Sunday.
- Yes.
We never go in the swimming pool together even if we want to, right?
Really.
- Thank you, Pooja.
- You're welcome.
Welcome.
Thank you.
I am Ready.
But there is a No Entry here.
Someone stop me.
Sir.
Ajunior priest has come from Guru's place.
He is here?
- Yes.
Make him comfortable..
- Yes.
The junior priest is here.
I'll go meet him and welcome him.
My wallet..
From the drawer..
That one.
Yes.
And the wallet..
Priest, why are you here?
I mean what brings you here?
I'll tell that later, but Guru is very angry with you.
Why?
- Why didn't you go to pick up Pooja from the airport?
I had gone there..
..but I got a little late.
She left to attend the wedding.
Yes, she will be going to the ashram directly from the wedding.
Be there on time to pick her up.
- As you say.
Where is everyone else?
- They are with Pooja..
But Pooja is..
- Not this one, the Pooja which was sent last month.
We sent a dog last month..
- Don't call her a dog.
The family members have named her Pooja.
They have named her Pooja?
A dog..
- Again you are calling her a dog.
Doggie, dog, puppy, pup, Raju, Tommy.
Nothing.
Call her Pooja.
Otherwise with a broom..
They are so madly in love with her that nowadays we eat dog food..
Dog..
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Pooja's food.
Pedigree and White Kennel.
So what should I call her?
Pooja?
Don't call her that if you want to lose your loincloth..
..and your honour.
Hello, Priest.
They are here to serve you.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Bless you.
Bless you.
Guru had kept a 'Satyanarayan' ritual..
- Very good.
He has sent the offering of that.
Sanjana..
As soon as they call for Pooja you come with the dog.
Tell me, where is Pooja.
She is here.
Pooja.
Now what do I tell you, Priest.
We have got very attached to Pooja in such a short span.
She is so sweet that as soon as she came, Prem..
She won everyone's heart.
'Oh God, what magic has this dog done in one month?
'
Our Pooja is as decent as she is beautiful.
'A decent dog?
'
'Have they lost their mind?
'
She is now our family member.
Does she bite?
What kind of a joke is that?
Is she a suckling that she will bite?
She is of marriageable age.
It's a different thing if she starts biting after marriage.
Whether she bites, scratches or does anything else..
..we have decided that she'll be the daughter-in-law of our family.
'They will make a dog their daughter-in-law?
'
'A dog will be perfect for you, son.'
'You deserve this.'
What are you thinking about?
That is happening with Guru's permission.
'Dandiya', 'Garba' (Gujarati dance forms).
No, no, no.
That..
That..
That..
Yes.
The alliance.
- The alliance.
The alliance.
'I think they have gone absolutely crazy.'
'They didn't go to pick up the Pooja Guru had sent..'
'..from the airport.'
'They have named their dog Pooja..'
'..and they are getting him married to her.'
'I'll also go crazy if I stay here any longer.'
I'll make a move.
Have lunch before you leave.
- Yes.
Pooja's favourite dishes have been made today.
'Oh, God.
They are feeding dog food to a priest?
'
Look, I..
You can have it.
I'm fasting today.
I'll make a move.
- Bye.
- Okay, Priest.
- Okay, Priest.
Who is this girl?
You don't recognize her?
You are strange.
She is our maid.
You had brought her here from the ashram.
'Look at that.
These lunatics think I am crazy.'
'I hope I really don't go crazy.'
Excuse me.
I'll make a move.
Okay.
- Okay.
"Baby, I can see the sun rising in your eyes."

"I kept walking on my path."

Maids.
- Yes, brother.
Where is everybody gone?
Brother..
Gone ashram.
Meeting Guru.
And Pooja?
- Gone.. with them too.
Why, brother?
Heart beating fasting?
Brother, where are you running?
Come on, come on.
- Come.
This is Guru's that.
What is it called..
As..
Ashram.
We've come here to fix a wedding date for your marriage with Prem.
Yes.
Let's go.
You go ahead.
We'll come.
- Okay.
Pooja, it is believed that all wishes..
Come.
Which Pooja are you talking about, Ram?
Pooja has not returned from her friend's wedding.
Then who is the one who has been staying..
..in our house as Pooja since the past few days.
Who is the scoundrel you ran away with?
Kill his entire family.
How is that possible!
You want me, right?
I'm ready to come with you.
Let's go.
Come on.
Leave me.
Brother-in-law.
Sanjana is not here.
I knew that you would surely come.
And I, too, knew that you would say..
.."I knew that you would surely come."
Why should I come, huh?
Am I your boyfriend?
I love you?
- Saw?
You are agreeing to it.
No.
Really?
He's your uncle?
Yes.
Prem, how would I tell you that..
..these goons, mafias are my maternal uncles?
Great.
Your family members are like Charles Shobraj and Ranja Billa?
I love these mafia people.
Stop joking, Prem.
You don't know how much my uncles hate each other
My mother's last wish was..
..that I get both my uncles' blessings at my wedding.
So that their enmity ends forever..
..and they become good human beings like they were, earlier.
But?
- The greed of attaining my property worth 200 crores..
..increased their enmity.
Each one of them wants me to marry his brother-in-law.
200 crores?
I can draw a cheque without deducting the TDS..
..and keep your uncles in my pocket.
But my dear, until there are obstacles in a love story..
..it is not called a love story.
What stories will we tell our children?
Look, a boyfriend gets scared of his girlfriend.
A girlfriend gets scared of a cockroach.
A cockroach gets scared of a mouse.
A mouse gets scared of a cat.
A cat gets scared of a dog.
And a dog gets scared of a man.
- And a man is scared of a woman.
- What?
Just like a villain..
gets scared of the hero.
Prem, let's go.
My uncle is here.
What now?
They will..
- Don't worry, dear.
Today, I'll predict your future.
You will get married to an innocent looking rogue.
That's me.
Now can I take some advantage?
By the way, the fitting of the Indian dress is very good.
"Ready..
I am ready for you.
Are you ready for me?"
"Are you ready for me?
Are you ready for me?"
"Are you ready for me?
I am ready for you."
Uncle, Yuvraj was forcefully..
I ran away from there.
Sit in the car.
They are drying out.
This boy is making me that.
That..
Irritate?
- No, not irritate.
That..
This..
This..
Emotional?
- Emotional is like this.
This..
- So?
He is making me this.
This.
This..
Crazy.
- Crazy.
- Crazy.
He is making crazy.
Crazy.
Crazy.
He lied to me.
That girl is not this but that.
What..
- Not Sanjana, Pooja.
Pooja.
Yes.
Yes.
What you are thinking of doing is not so easy.
They are dangerous.
- Yes.
They are dons.
I would've said the same had I been in your place.
But.. what would've you done had you been in my place?
Why don't you make him understand?
What should I tell him?
All I know is that Sanjana is a very nice girl.
And right now, she must be in trouble.
She must be in big trouble.
That's true, sister-in-law.
But there is no solution to this problem.
I have such a solution that I'll make the lives of both the dons, hell.
They have a common CA, who has done BA.
And his name..
What was his name?
Sounds like bully.
- Idli (a south Indian snack)?
Mulli (Raddish)?
Pulley.
- Talli (drunk)?
No, close.
Close.
Khuli (open)?
Khali?
Khali.
Balli.
Balidaan Bhardwaj.
Sakku, how many times will you call me?
I feel that you call me even when you dial a wrong number.
What do I do?
You have left the house with so much cash.
I'm feeling scared.
This isn't the first time I'm out with so much cash.
I do transactions worth millions, day and night.
All 500 and 1000 denomination bills..
..across the world knows Balidaan Bhardwaj.
Then?
- That's fine.
But what if a thief stabs you and robs you?
Sakku, are you concerned about me..
..or are you trying to kill me?
Hang up, Sakku.
I want two demands drafts made.
One of30 lakhs and the other of20 lakhs.
Take this.
My bag?
My bag!
Where did my bag go?
Where is my bag?
There was 50 lakhs in the bag.
Where did the bag go?
My bag.
My bag got stolen.
Have you seen a thief here?
- No.
You blind man, you didn't see the thief?
.
You didn't even see such a big bag?
I didn't see it.
I'm not the owner of it.
You..
Have you seen your face?
It's so black that if shown on National Television..
..it will ward off evil from the entire country.
Sakku, what you said came true.
Sakku.
What happened?
Amar Chaudhary and Suraj Chaudhary's 50 lakhs got stolen.
What?
Don't do this.
Pack the bags.
It's time to leave the city.
Come on.
- Yes.
They are here.
Tell them I am not here.
I'll go and hide myself.
Mr. Bhardwaj.
Mr. Bhardwaj.
He has not only left this house but this world as well.
A trunk ran over him.
- Oh, no.
He got crushed.
Do you have anyone to look after you in this cruel world?
No.
By the way, I had brought this bag for him.
What will I do of this briefcase when he is no more?
Don't worry.
I'll take care of both his belongings.
Okay?
Let's meet after his final rites.
Bring it here.
Where are you going?
You are alive, sir?
- Yes, I'm alive.
It's her hobby.
She kills her husband over everything.
Start wearing a wedding chain from tomorrow.
People get mistaken.
She is mine.
And.. this bag is also mine.
There are only 50 lakhs in it, right, sir?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
There are only 50 lakhs..
Just a minute.
How did you come to know that there are 50 lakhs in it?
Just be looking at the bundle of the notes..
..I can predict how many notes it contains.
How?
- I learnt this art from my master.
Mr. B. B., sir.
Bishan Singh Bedi?
- No, sir.
Then?
Balibhrambhat.
- No, no, sir.
Bichun Bhutia.
Goal.
No way, sir.
The one who has written this book.
Mr. Balidaan Bhardwaj.
Be careful, sir.
I've written a book?
When did I write this book?
Such a fat book?
You?
- Yes.
Look at this.
The Balidaan in front of Bhardwaj is me.
That's me.
This is a sign of a genius.
You wrote a book and you don't even remember.
Sir, this book is a missile and you are an example..
..for a newcomer like me.
I have come to this city to be your assistant, sir.
I see.
- I want to learn the ropes of this job with you.
I don't want any money either.
- Then my job is done.
I mean your job is done.
- Thank you, sir.
I have only two clients.
Amar Chaudhary and Suraj Chaudhary.
Sir, they are mafias.
One is a mongoose.
And the other one is a snake.
If they get together then they are killer sharks.
But both of them are illiterates.
How many times during a year do you think..
..people like Chaudhary must be paying their taxes?
Sir, they must not even be paying the taxi fare.
Sir..
I make them pay tax every month.
Every month?
Again and again.
- Again and again.
12 times.
- 12 times.
Yes.
What do I do?
It is dirty but it is my business.
It is your business.
This is the only way to teach a lesson to those goons.
Sir, your name is Balidaan but you are making your clients sacrifice.
Now that you have joined me..
..everyone will be sacrificed..
with Prem (love).
Come with us.
Come with us.
- Why are you hitting me?
Come with us.
Come with us.
- Why are you hitting me?
Hit him.
Stop.
Stop.
Don't hit me.
Stop.
Stop.
I am your teacher, Amar Chaudhary.
Teacher?
You are a cheater, you scoundrel.
You give me a zero in the exams.
You gave the wrong answer.
What was the question?
Who is the president of India?
- Mrs. Prathiba Patil.
You had said that it was Abdul Kallam.
The president got changed.
It is my fault that the president got changed?
What do I have to do with when and where Alexander fought Porus?
Do I have to go there and dig their graves?
Hit him.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Well done.
You are doing well, Amar Chaudhary.
Saw that?
That's why I named him after me.
Amar Chaudhary.
Hey, Amar Chaudhary!
You stinky insect of a dirty sewer?
Mother, you go inside.
- Stop barking, you dog.
And let him go.
Otherwise I'll poison your food and feed you.
Got it?
Hey, go.
Take him back with dignity.
Go.
Yes.
- Go.
Let's go, sir.
Grandpa, you are being abused under his pretext.
No, no.
It's not so.
You are like a father to my daughter-in-law.
You are God.
A born leech.
- What?
He is.
This Amar Chaudhary.
It's time for school.
Don't you have to go?
Father, should I get something for you?
Yes, daughter-in-law.
Get some tea for me.
Okay.
- Without sugar.
And without poison.
Have some sweets, Mr. Chaudhary.
I got the land for your liquor factory cleared.
And it hardly cost you anything.
Only 50 lakhs.
Balli.
- Yes.
Don't you know you cannot bring strangers in here?
Who is he?
- He's my nephew.
Nephew?
- Yes, look.
We look similar, don't we?
You mean when I am of your age I will look like you?
Forget about the face, Mr. Chaudhary.
Talk about brains.
He is from America.
He will show your income so less..
..that you won't need to pay tax.
- Really?
You know the billionaire in America?
K.K. Modi.
He used to handle his account.
K. K. Modi?
- K. K. Modi?
Forget it.
Forget K. K. Modi.
Now that you are here you work for Mr. Chaudhary.
Handle his account.
Hire you nephew.
- Nephew!
Grandpa, it sounds like your business.
Ganja.
Balli.
- Yes?
You didn't teach your nephew how to salute?
Salute me.
What to get thrashed?
What did you say?
- No.
I saw my horoscope in the morning.
Yes.
- In it it's written that if I salute..
..anyone younger than me today..
..then he will get thrashed all day long.
But still if you want..
- No, no.
Let it be.
But I have read his horoscope.
Balli.
Come on.
- Let it be, today.
My nephew is with me.
So..
Balli.
Yes.
Now my hands feel warmer.
The apple of my eye.
My brave boy.
- Wild hippo, Amar Chaudhary.
Write 'Welcome' on your face.
You will look like a rotten doormat.
Anyway, your ponytail looks like a dead dog's tail.
Look at your grandpa.
It suits him so well.
Take this.
Stupid.
Go to school.
Yes, grandpa.
This is the first time mother has said the right thing.
The girls in my class tease me.
They said it looks like theirs.
With your permission can I chop it off?
.
Amar Chaudhary, you can have your neck cut but not your ponytail.
This is a warning, not advice.
We are samurais.
This is the identity of our family.
Your I.D. proof.
It is a voter's card, pan card.
Your blood group.
A proof that you are his grandson and he is your grandpa.
Where did this boring old man come from?
Great grandpa.
I saw you.
Today my day will go well.
Concentrate on your studies.
Kids of your age have gone places.
People of your age as well..
..have gone places.
"Happy days are over."
"Now I'm surrounded with sadness."
What is this, Mr. Lehri?
What are you doing?
I'm having black coffee with Obama in the White House.
Can't you see?
I hit the brakes to give you a lift.
Now my shirt has turned into a mop.
All this happened because of me, right?
I'm feeling very guilty.
I love you too.
Now it is my duty to get you out of here.
I also want to leave.
Because if my children grow up they won't recognize me.
And my wife is so nave that the poor thing..
..might once again run away with someone.
No such thing will happen because I have a mind-blowing idea.
This is the boy with whom Sanjana ran away, sir.
He doesn't look like he is from our city.
I'll find him even if he is hiding underground.
Are you telling the truth?
Sir, if I am lying he should die immediately.
No, I take his oath and say that henceforth..
..that that boy was not him but someone else.
Sir.
- What happened?
Sir, someone has come to meet you.
Balli, you got the land cleared for Amar for his liquor factory?
I just got the land cleared for him.
But for you along with the land I also got..
..the license for the liquor factory cleared.
Lehri, go.
You are free to go.
Mr. Chaudhary, I am leaving but before leaving..
..I would like to give you a warning.
Sir, this boy is very smart.
Only I know how he traps people.
You won't be able to anything to him..
..even if he comes and stands before you.
You do one thing.
You keep cleaning cars here till Sanjana's marriage.
Sir, what are you saying?
Sir, this is a crime.
It's a sin.
Mr. Chaudhary, you cannot do this.
Mr. Chaudhary can do anything.
He is Justice Chaudhary.
He provides justice to good people.
And he clears out the bad people.
Pick him and throw him out.
Balli, who is this boy?
He is a con.
C-O-N.
Con.
He joined hands with that girl and fooled me.
Which animal have I left out?
- You dog, clean the car.
Mr. Chaudhary, isn't the boy useful?
Once I start working, there will be no income and no tax.
No income tax.
But Balli, how is this possible?
This boy will work for Amar as well as us.
He has a habit..
..of doing two things together.
You know K.K. Modi in America?
He used to also handle his younger brother S.K. Modi's account.
But what if he turns out to be bad?
Then you can behead my uncle.
Behead me?
- Saw?
He agrees to it.
The thumb impression on the file.
Take it.
Just a minute.
Uncle, I was casually checking your accounts.
There are a lot of discrepancies.
What?
- There must be a slight difference.
21.
- 21..
Balli.
There is a difference of Rs.21.
Rs.21, dear?
It's hardly a difference.
Just a minute, uncle.
You are his assistant, right?
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on, show me the accounts.
Uncle, I'll go and check the accounts properly.
Yes, yes.
Okay, dear.
Hey..
Persuade her.
- Consider it done.
Balli, you saw how my niece's education is benefiting me?
Prem, this is not the right situation to take advantage.
Really?
Then promise me that you will meet me tonight.
And you will let me take all the advantages.
- Prem.
You..
You okay?
- Yes.
I was justjoking.
Balli, why do you look as if you've seen a ghost?
Our future daughter-in-law is checking everything, right?
Yes.
In detail.
Come with me.
Come with me.
Let them work.
Saw that?
My future wife is no ordinary girl.
Yes, I just came to know.
She has taken after me deceased sister.
So, your sister was also like her?
Then the entire family..
What happened?
He is getting scared.
- He fears he might get caught.
Sanjana..
Sanjana is not my daughter.
She is more than a daughter to me, Prem.
Her happiness means everything to me.
But..
But you don't know her uncles.
They..
- I know.
They are rogues from the Neanderthal times.
Orthodox.
I am a modern age dog.
Latest.
When we will fight, I will eat them up.
"I am a dog and she is my partner."
"I tell the truth, when she came.."
"..there came a season to eat everyone up."
Stop it.
Look, aunt, everything will be fine.
I promise.
What were you doing inside?
All that cuddling and all?
Uncle, she fell over me.
Girls from affluent families..
Hello.
Girls from affluent families are like that.
Try to understand.
Whether she falls on you or you fall on her..
..our necks will get cut and fall down.
Uncle, you only asked me to persuade her.
I got persuaded.
You would've got exposed..
..if she would've opened the accounts.
This is the first time I have let a girl touch me and you..
No, no.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
You are my disciple.
Come on, get in.
Get in.
Let's go.
Let's go.
"In 12 months I'll express my love to you in 12 different ways."
"Now I think I won't be able to survive.."
"..even for 12 minutes without you."
"When the winter season starts in January."
"We will switch on the heater of love."
"In a blanket as small as February.."
"..we will play hide and seek."
"March will be a romantic month."
"We'll do something we have never done before."
"What if we aren't able to meet in April?"
"What will happen?
Find a solution."
"I'll get an internet connection so that I can chat with you."
"When the summer season starts in May.."
"..we will party at the poolside."
"We will take a long vacation in June."
"We will go to a hill station."
"When starts raining in July.."
"..
I'll yearn to embrace you."
"We will have a lot of fun in August."
"We will make some arrangements."
"I'll take you to London.
I'll give you a tour of Paris."
"I'll take you on a world tour."
"I feel that I'll be coming often to your house in September."
"We'll see the sunsets together in October."
"You can keep your head on my shoulders."
"By the time the wretch November comes.."
"..you would've already surrendered your heart."
"Things will get confirmed on 12th December."
"With the confirmation from our hearts."
"There will be no car or mare."
"I'll bring the wedding procession on foot."
"In 12 months I'll express my love to you in 12 different ways."
"Now I think I won't be able to survive.."
"..even for 12 minutes without you."
Prem hasn't come as yet, dear.
Don't worry, aunt.
He will surely come.
Why don't you go and pay your respects..
..as you have come to the temple, Junior Chaudhary?
Tell me.
I prayed for a week before my exams.
He failed me.
- Then why have you come here?
I'm my grandpa's junior spy.
Whenever any female in the family goes out of the house..
..I keep an eye on them.
Whether they are going and meeting our enemies.
Aunt.
Go.
My child.
Bless you.
- That's enough.
Bless you.
Sister.
Someone stop them.
You are crying?
They are bound to cry.
These sisters-in-law love each other more than their own sister.
In spite of living in the same city we have met after ages.
Our men our fighting and we women are suffering.
I wonder when this will end.
Like I have united the aunts I will unite the uncles as well.
If I don't turn this family into a 'Hum Aapke Hain Kyon' family..
..then don't call me Prem.
Thank you.
Okay, so you are befriending our enemies..
..in the pretext of praying and worshiping?
Son, she isn't an enemy.
She is your grandaunt.
Amar, my child.
- Don't touch me, you old woman.
Scoundrel, if you say a word more..
..I'll feed you kerosene and light a match in front of your mouth.
Get out of here.
Forgive him, sister.
His grandfather has made him just like him.
I wonder when he will mend his ways.
Why are you laughing?
He will change, but I'm laughing..
..thinking of the way in which he will change.
Junior Chaudhary, the park is closed.
It's closed for others, not me.
Go and tell the manager, Amar Chaudhary is here.
The park will remain open.
Okay, sir.
- Okay, sir.
Come here, you animal.
Salute me.
The park should be closed now.
We have to go home.
You are refusing Amar Chaudhary?
Come here.
How dare you!
I won't spare you.
Go.
Who..
Who are you?
Badman.
Badman?
- Yes.
I'm here to turn a bad boy like you into a good boy.
You..
One kick and from Badman you will become a dead man.
Kick me.
Kick me.
Kick me.
Really?
Here you go.
Darn him.
I am sorry, bad-man.
Spare me.
Forgive me.
Okay.
From today, you'll be a good boy.
Yes, I will.
You won't bunk school.
- Okay.
You won't trouble your teachers.
You'll always respect your elders.
And you will cut your ponytail as well.
- Yes.
No, no.
This is not possible.
It is the identity of my family.
Shut up.
The kid has tired me.
First try to talk things out.
If they don't understand then kick them.
Great, Balli.
Great.
Your nephew is one in a million.
Amar Chaudhary.
Why do you have bandana on your head?
It's the latest fashion, grandpa.
Okay.
Okay.
Fashion.
Come here, my tiger.
And hit on this jackal's head.
Bless me, uncle Balli.
What are you doing?
Respecting my elders, grandfather.
This is what Badman has taught us.
Who Badman?
- He is our new teacher, grandpa.
Teacher?
Grandpa, his new teacher is Prem.
Dear, now I feel he'll also bring my two scoundrels back on track.
Hello
Uncle, uncle Suraj is once again trying to get me married to Veer.
What?
- Yes.
But I want to marry your son, Yuvraj.
Yuvraj?
- Please, uncle.
Please, do something.
Please, quickly get me out of here.
Someone is coming.
Come on, get the cars out.
Load your guns.
Let there be bloodshed?
We will have to bring Sanjana at any cost by this evening.
What are you doing, Chaudhary..
Sir.
Uncle, tell them.
What you are doing is wrong.
You are going to kill your brother for 200 crores?
Whereas someone worth 500 crores is in uncle's pocket.
Who are you talking about?
Uncle, I'm talking about K.K Modi.
Yes.
K.K. Modi from America.
Tell them how much he is worth.
He is worth 5000-7000 crores.
And hear this.
You know who has been given..
..the responsibility of getting his daughter Naina married?
Uncle.
Uncle, you couldn't see this gem of a person?
Whereas Naina desires a gem of a person.
They are such lovely people.
They are romantic.
They are going to kill their brothers.
Uncle, if I wouldn't have thought of this..
..then there would've been a bloodshed today.
Why don't you think?
No, the idea was on the way in my mind..
..but because of traffic..
Get this straight, Balli.
If we don't get this alliance then consider yourself death.
Get out of here.
I took K.K. Modi's name just like that.
You added his daughter to the story.
You added the responsibility of her marriage.
You added all the spices.
Sir, you told me all this..
after having a few drinks.
I told you about people who don't exist?
They exist, sir.
Listen.
- Yes?
Some K.K. Modi has called five times since morning.
He told me to remind you that he is coming..
..to India on Friday to discuss his daughter's wedding.
And yes, he has asked to book some resort.
Don't forget.
How is this possible?
Sir, this means you either have MP or UP.
Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh?
MP means memory power.
- Okay.
Sir, in this illness the battery of memory conks off.
Or UP that is unbelievable power.
Unbelievable power.
- Yes, sir.
In this the characters you think about come in real life.
I don't believe this.
That's why it is called unbelievable power.
Now you have to decide whether..
..it's your effective thinking or defective disease.
Meanwhile, sir, you have thrown me out of the house.
Bye.
Taxi!
- No, Prem.
I said that as I was worried.
Please.
Okay.
- Don't leave me in such confusion.
Okay, sir.
Tell me what I should do next.
There is no option or resort to this.
Yes, the last resort is that you book a resort.
Okay.
They have come?
Limo.
Ballu.
Ballu.
Uncle, go and welcome Modi.
What a pleasant surprise.
Come here.
Come here.
Give your friend a hug.
You have become fit.
I think it is the result of sister-in-law Shakuntala's that.
Love.
- Her love.
How is sister-in-law Sakku?
I hope you didn't have any that on the way.
What is it..
No, no.
One has to take some that for one's child.
Some..
Trouble.
- Yes, trouble.
Let's go.
Mr. Modi.
- Mr. Modi.
Stop.
Is this a way to ask for donations?
Mr. Modi, he is Mr. Chaudhary.
Avery famous L in the city.
- Landlord?
- Landlord.
- Landlord.
Mr. Modi, welcome, welcome, welcome.
Welcome.
Uncle Modi.
Aunt Modi.
Balli works for us.
Okay, Balli knows you.
That means he is our that..
Guest.
- Guest.
Guest.
Call him tonight for..
- Drinks?
Dinner.
Dinner.
And that as well.
Let's go.
Why are you staring at them with your mouth open?
Have you seen them for the first time?
Anyone will give that reaction on seeing Mr. Modi.
Sir, if you are a mouse then he is a cat.
If you are a cat, he is a dog.
If you are a dog, he is a fox.
If you are a fox then he is a lion.
If you are lion then he is an elephant.
If you are an elephant then he is a dinosaur.
Dinosaur of business, sir.
For your own good, come on time for dinner.
Otherwise you are a donkey, sir.
Who is going anywhere?
I am here till night.
Yes.
- Yes.
Let's go.
What happened, uncle?
He met me with so much affection.
He gave me a hug as well.
But I couldn't recognize him.
Is it an illness or my imagination?
Both.
- Both?
One personality is ill.
It is the imagination of the other personality.
The first and the second personality clashed..
..with each other and resulted in the third personality.
Spilt personality.
The fourth personality will be suicidal personality.
You will feel like committing suicide, uncle.
You are right.
- No.
I feel like committing suicide.
- No.
Yes.
- Don't do it, uncle.
- Why?
You won't remember that you have committed suicide, uncle.
So what should I do?
Uncle, now you have only one option left.
What?
- Believe that your personality with imagination is right.
You know him.
He is K.K. Modi.
- You recognize him.
I'll have to.
Otherwise, I'll commit suicide..
..and I won't even remember it.
So what's the use?
He is K.K. Modi.
Mr. Modi, we are not as rich as you are.
But we are well respected in the city.
Great.
- Yes, sir.
They are decent people.
Really?
- They have a lot of cars and are cultured as well.
So brother, tell us, how much loan do you want?
No, sister-in-law, I am..
Balli, tell them.
- What should I say?
Uncle, with your permission can I tell them?
- Yes, please.
Mr. Modi, he is his brother-in-law.
Yuvraj.
He has studied till the 8th grade.
The 8th grade.
Raise two more fingers.
Yes, the 8th grade.
He has studied till the 8th grade.
So?
He wants to marry your daughter.
- What?
Brother Ballu, you have brought such an alliance?
Have you seen their faces?
They look as if they have just come out of a jungle.
Right.
Will their daughter marry into this illiterate family?
The Modis.
They don't have any sense of that.
Fashion.
Nor do they know how to that.
- Talk.
To talk.
They look like that.
That..
Ape-men.
- Ape-men.
If you weren't my friend I would have done that.
Shot.
- Shot you.
Let's go..
- Sumitra.
- Sumitra.
Let's go.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- Okay.
You ruined their mood.
- Shut up.
Shut up.
You..
I'll blow your head with you, you scoundrel.
You fool, he isn't a scoundrel, you are.
Do you know who are you messing with?
You can only make scrabbled-eggs from an egg.
Mr. Modi can turn scrabbled-eggs back to an egg.
You have spoilt the whole game.
But it's okay.
Uncle is here.
He will think of something.
What will I think of?
.
I am totally confused.
Will you tell us what this is all about?
Why have you made us all wear sunglasses?
Excuse me for my language, grandpa.
But what do these Modis think of themselves?
They have kept three conditions for the wedding.
I told them that I won't be able to look into your eyes..
..after telling you those conditions.
And you won't be able to look at each other after hearing them.
He said, "Here, make them wear these sunglasses.."
"..and tell them the conditions."
Tell us.
Tell us, what their conditions are.
Basically the Modis have made..
..the tent of Chaudhary's lives stand on three sticks.
Condition No. 1.
They don't like the way you dress.
What are you doing?
They say that you look like a C-Grade movie's villain.
How dare they!
This..
This is what uncle said.
How dare they!
- Yes.
Yes.
The Chaudharys will never change..
..their dressing sense for their 500 crores.
- Yes.
500..
- Crores.
Okay.
Okay.
We will wear up-to-date suits.
Yes.
- Yes.
Yes.
What is their second condition?
Their family is a joint family like in the movie 'Hum Aapke Hain Kyon'.
They all live together.
So is our family like in the movie 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham'?
We stay separately?
They have never seen you out on a lunch or a picnic..
..with your daughters and daughters-in-law.
- Enough.
They are womenfolk.
This tradition has been going on since ages.
This is what uncle said as well.
- What?
That the Chaudharys will never change their tradition for 500 crores.
Yes.
- 500 crores.
Fine.
Fine.
Listen.
Listen.
Henceforth, we'll all be together.
Tell me the third condition.
If I tell you the third condition then.. your pants will tear.
Pants?
- I am saying this.
I am saying this.
He had said something else.
Tell me the condition.
You'll have to cut it.
- What?
You'll have to cut your ponytail.
- No.
Even uncle yelled and said no.
- Yes.
Yes.
But what can we do?
They hold the trump card of 500 crores.
500 crores. 500 crores.
Cut them, Amar.
You can always grow them back.
But you don't often get a harvest worth 500 crores.
Great.
Now you are looking that and that.
Bold and beautiful.
- Bold and the beautiful.
So tell us, brother.
What have you decided?
What have I..
What do you say, Ballu?
Should I do that?
Yes?
- Do it.
Now that you have found a diamond..
..better set it in the ring.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Fine, then I'll call my daughter and younger that tomorrow.
Brother.
- Brother.
Okay.
- Do you have relatives or brothers or something like that?
No.
He has an elder brother..
Name?
- Suraj Chaudhary.
In spite of having an elder brother..
..you have come alone to fix the alliance?
Where is he?
How can he come here?
We don't get along.
A house where brothers don't that..
- Get along.
Get long.
Will their daughter go there?
- The Modis.
The Modis.
What he means is that their timings don't match.
He is sometimes out and he is sometimes in.
These two brothers love each other a lot.
Like..
Lord Rama and Laxman.
- Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So call them tonight.
Match the..
Timings.
- Timing.
Yes.
Consider it to be our that..
- Condition.
- Yes.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Don't hit my uncle.
What was the need to say..
- Sister-in-law, please, help.
That I have an elder brother?
I said it because you have one.
You could have said that he is dead.
You are strange.
How could say that?
Till date you haven't been able to kill him.
So uncle, how will you kill him?
But we are dead now.
That old man will never listen to us.
Hey, when God gave uncle a head over his shoulders..
..he didn't give it for decoration.
He will think.
He will think of something.
He will bring your brother by his ears.
Shut up.
Suraj Chaudhary will behead me even if I talk about it.
And if he doesn't come here then I'll behead you.
What?
Hey, let us go in.
Move aside.
Side.
Side.
Side.
- Who are you?
Keep distance.
Horn please.
May the face of the one with ill-intentions in his heart go black!
Seize the whole place.
Take everyone's mobiles.
Disconnect their phone.
Hey, who are you?
In this manner..
This is how we enter.
You have all the right to remain silent..
..as this is a raid.
I pay income tax thirteen times a year.
Yet there is a raid?
Sir, Ms. Sanjana.
Hello, uncle Mathur.
Hello, dear.
How are you?
Sanjana, you know these income-tax guys?
Aunt, they are not from the income-tax department.
They are from the World Bank.
I have heard of Punjab Bank and Allahabad Bank.
What is a World Bank?
The one outside Punjab and Allahabad is called World Bank.
The father of all banks.
And the mother of all banks.
Uncle and aunt of all banks.
But, sir, what are you doing here?
Ms. Sanjana's father had taken a loan of200 crores from our bank.
So?
- So he passed away before he could settle the loan.
So?
- He keeps on saying 'so'.
He will lose his mind when he will hear this.
So, we have seized all his property in America.
We have managed to get back 100 crores.
We still need to recover 100 crores.
But Sanjana doesn't hold any property here.
She came here to get married to me.
Fantastic.
After marriage a wife has equal right over the property.
Hence, according to law, we will recover 100 crores from you.
The bungalow itself must be worth 50-60 crores.
Come, let's go.
Let's go.
Mr. Lover, I knew that you would get this marriage canceled.
But what is this issue of100 crores?
Should I tell you everything today itself?
.
What's the rush?
Where are you going?
You are here.
Polish them.
Balli, what kind of a law is this?
The law is according to the place.
Uncle, including this house and other things..
..you will manage to arrange 100 crores, right?
You, too, wouldn't want my deceased father..
..to owe a loan to anyone, right?
Listen, assistant.
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on, let's check the value of the property.
Okay.
- Again?
No.
Actually I have some work with him.
Not now.
Okay?
Fine.
We will begin once your work is done.
Okay, ma'am.
How much work will you do?
You will get tired.
You..
- Everyone is standing here.
It's written in the scriptures, uncle..
..the more you work the better it is.
This girl will put me on streets to beg.
Now I got it.
Why did he break the alliance with this girl..
..and formed an alliance with K.K. Modi.
He knows that this girl has a loan over her head.
Balli.
- Yes.
Instead of us, you got K.K. Modi's daughter..
..alliance fixed into Amar's family.
If he has ruined it, he will mend it.
How?
- How?
You know B.K. Modi.
- Who is B.K. Modi?
You only had said that K.K. Modi has a younger brother.
Yes.
Yes.
He does.
He does.
K.K. Modi has a younger brother.
But what about him?
- His money.
What about his money?
You only had said..
- What?
That he is richer..
..than his elder brother when it comes to money.
Yes.
Yes.
I said so.
But what about him?
- His daughter.
Daughter.
- Daughter.
His daughter's..
mother will also be there.
What about his daughter?
You had taken the responsibility of getting her married.
Wow, Balli.
No matter what you say that's a great condition.
Not condition, connection.
- Whatever.
But tell him Mr. Modi's conditions.
Yes, ma'am.
Coming.
I'll go and check the property.
I'll see how much worth it is.
Darling Balli, what conditions do these Modis have?
"Forgot tradition and became ready."
"If they get it right they will make it big."
"Money can make you do anything."
Amar!
- Brother!
Brother!
Where is your party?
Has gone to pickup your party at the airport.
Where did she come from?
Did you call her?
It feels very nice to see the two of you together today, uncle.
Now my problem is also over.
Now both of you decide who I should marry.
Dear, you should forget Veer.
Last night your mother visited me in my dreams.
And she said, "Veer isn't good enough for my Sanjana."
So the confusion is over.
I will get married to Yuvraj.
No, no, no, no, no, dear.
Yuvraj is absolutely useless.
Your mother visited me in my dreams as well.
She started crying.
She said, "Brother, don't ruin my Sanjana's life.
More tears.
What about me?
Will I stay single all my life?
- Not at all, dear.
We, your uncles are there for you.
We will find someone good enough for you.
Nice, capable and decent.
We will have a grand wedding for you.
Why do you worry, dear?
We are there for you.
- Yes.
Okay, uncle.
Whatever you feel is right.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Meet him.
He's my younger brother..
- B.K..
B.K. Modi.
- Yes.
- Modi.
Look who it is.
Ballu.
How are you, Ballu?
Hi, B.K. How are you?
You look fit.
I think sister-in-law's love has played its trick.
How is sister-in-law, Sakku?
She's absolutely fine.
She keeps talking about all of you.
How is B.K?
What is he doing these days?
That's fine.
Mr. Modi, the girls didn't come with you?
To hell with the girls.
- What?
- What?
He means say hello to Naina and Sunaina.
Yes, they are the apple of their mothers' eyes.
Naina.
- Sunaina.
They both are great, aren't they?
Walk straight.
What are you thinking about, uncle?
What are you thinking about?
I couldn't recognize the other Modi as well.
Uncle, this means it's not an illness but an imagination.
You mean the character I think about, comes to life?
Yes.
You have the power.
Otherwise, how is it possible, uncle.
What will we call a person with such imagination?
We cannot call him human.
You mean I am..
God?
Brahma.
The Creator.
The creator of the universe.
Balli.
Balli.
Look..
How they address God.
Idiots.
He has regained consciousness.
Now we will have fun.
Start that.
Mr. Chaudhary, he is out of coma, but he is unable to speak.
How can he not speak?
Son..
Tell me, who was he?
Speak up.
Tell me.
Who was he?
Tell me, son.
Try to speak.
Try.
Uncle, why is he pointing towards you?
Balli.
This means you..
No, sir.
I cannot even put a comma to sentence.
How can I put him into coma?
Mr. Chaudhary, your son is still not out of coma.
His mind is spinning hence he is moving his finger here and there.
Look, now he is pointing towards him.
Mr. Chaudhary, your son's condition is so bad..
..that he might even point his finger towards you.
Oh, my.
The son is pointing towards his father.
Please go out.
The patient is getting hyper.
Doctor, make my son get well soon.
Because the day he will come out of coma..
..someone else will go into coma.
Let's go.
Let's go.
There are so many sorrows in this world.
Your sorrow is so less.
You aren't able to say anything..
..because of your unconscious state.
And he cannot say anything even when he is conscious.
So sad is this and how bad is that.
Continue.
Sir.
No, sir.
Madam..
- Move back.
I don't care.
Please sir.
Sir, please.
- It's not my problem..
..as to with whom Mr. Chaudhary..
..is having his breakfast and his lunch.
Mr. Chaudhary, I've been looking for you all over the city.
And you are having fun over here.
You are having parties.
I'm being pressurized by the bank.
I keep getting phone calls.
Tell me what you want to do.
Mr. Modi, you are here?
What a pleasant surprise.
Hello, sister-in-law.
- Hello, brother.
Sister-in-law, it seems like you have come here on a holiday.
No, brother.
Our daughters are getting that with the brothers-in-law.
They are getting married with the brothers-in-law.
Mr. Suraj.
- Yes.
Your brother-in-law Veer was going to marry your niece, right?
No.
Niece?
Who is his niece?
Here she is.
Sanjana.
She is a very nice girl.
Why do you want to get related to us instead of her?
Actually, what happened was..
- For Sanjana's happiness.
Sanjana doesn't like Veer and that's why..
..Mr. Chaudhary cancelled the wedding.
Great people.
This is very that.
- Good.
- Good.
Avery good thing.
But brother, it's wrong as well.
Look brother, there is a young unmarried girl in their family.
And they are getting their brothers-in-law married.
It is wrong, isn't it?
True.
It is not so.
Mr. Chaudhary is looking for a suitable boy for her.
He will get her married as soon as he finds a suitable boy.
Take your time and find a boy.
We are here for four days.
Look, first Sanjana will get married then our daughters will.
But Mr. Modi..
- No ifs or buts.
Consider this to be our that.
- Condition.
- Our condition.
Yes.
- Another condition?
Don't worry.
All the four Chaudharys are charged.
They will do something in four days.
Great people.
People, everybody join me please.
"Whether you are a crescent or the moonlight."
"No matter what you are.."
"..
I swear on God, you are great."
Clap, everyone.
Great.
Great.
Brother, the Chaudharys might get a heart attack..
..listening to your conditions.
Brother has kept a condition ofSanjana's wedding.
- Yes.
But you'll have to give the idea that our Prem will be her groom.
Yes.
This condition has been kept to give this idea.
Okay.
But they are very dangerous people.
If they find out the truth..
There is one person who is very dangerous.
Lehri.
He is very smart.
But he has already said such a big lie..
..that now if he tells the truth, he will be the first one to die.
'Okay, so this is his family and not the Modi family.'
Mr. Balidaan.
Balidaan.
The poor thing is standing as a statue.
Fine, I will bring it into life.
Brother.
Brother.
Brother.
I have come here to tell you a secret.
Here he is.
Here he is.
You are doing pushups?
No, I'm pushing the ground down.
Keep quiet.
Keep quiet.
Tell me, who am I?
Am I God?
Am I a human being?
Who am I?
You are the first God with has been made by this human being.
What not have you made me?
Now even I have forgotten who I am.
I have become the Aamir Khan in the movie 'Gajani'.
Look here.
Look at this.
You have no idea how difficult it is to write on your back!
Rascal.
You played such a big game with a genius like me..
..who has written such a famous book?
Give me the book, please.
Here you go, genius.
I won't let you win as long as I am alive.
What will I do?
Mr. Balli, Mr. Chaudhary is calling you.
Go.
You have been summoned.
Yes.
Yes, I've put the ball in the hole.
I've learnt to play golf.
This is how we used to play marbles as well.
You are right.
- Greetings, sir.
Come.
Come, Mr. Balidaan.
Come.
You summoned me?
We have known each other since ages.
Why don't we turn this acquaintance into a relationship?
I didn't get you.
Your nephew Prem and our niece Sanjana.
Let's get them married.
- No.
No, this marriage cannot take place.
Why not?
You are a servant.
We are your employer.
You don't like the respect we are giving you?
Hello.
Why cannot this marriage take place, uncle?
We are their loyal servants.
We have to pay them back in someway or the other.
Right, uncle?
- Don't touch me.
You see, the girl has a loan of100 crores over her head.
That too of the World Bank.
Who will pay it back?
You?
We will pay it back.
We are going to get millions from the Modis.
You can keep 100-125 out of it.
Not 125, only 100 crores.
The amount of the loan.
After that even if you sent your daughter..
..without any clothes on, we will accept her.
Great.
Right, uncle?
We accept it, don't we?
- Yes.
Sanjana, my child..
I accept this match, uncle.
Uncle, your teeth will break if you will grind them so hard.
Mr. Chaudhary, there is a problem.
This Lehri keeps saying that Sanjana..
..had eloped with a boy during her wedding.
If someone comes to know about it on my wedding day..
..then my uncle will be defamed.
Can you please take care of this Lehri, sir?
Go and find Lehri.
Get him here.
Yes, Mr. Chaudhary?
Who eloped with Sanjana?
- This..
What is this that you are asking me?
I had shown you the photograph.
A lie.
You are lying.
He had eloped with Sanjana.
You are right.
He had eloped with her.
Forgive me, I had lied.
He is the one I had given a lift to.
Henceforth, this is what you should tell everyone.
Got it?
Are you happy now, Prem?
Yes, Mr. Chaudhary.
Mr. Lehri, you don't know what a big favour..
..you have done to my uncle and the Chaudhary family.
God will surely send you to heaven.
Congratulations, Balli.
You became their that.
What is it?
Yes, their relative.
Mr. Modi, you are the one who gave us this idea.
Otherwise, how could we ever think of this?
Have this.
Why did you unnecessarily take the that.
Trouble.
You go and have your meal.
We'll all have together.
No, we don't know how long we will take.
Why should you stay that because of us?
Hungry.
Go, have your meal.
Okay.
- I love you.
That's great, Mr. Modi.
At your place the women eat before the men do.
At our place, till we do eat, the women will die but..
..not touch the food.
This is wrong.
Look, women live in a very that world.
Small.
It begins from and ends at us.
The house and kids.
She is that in them.
What is it said?
Yes, restricted.
Hence it is our duty to look after them.
We should love them.
We should always keep them that.
We should keep them happy.
Radhika..
What happened?
Nothing.
You have your meal.
Before you?
So what?
If I drink all night along..
..will you stay hungry till the morning?
What is wrong with you, today?
Love.
I love you.
Sorry.
Shalu.
Shalu?
- Yes, Shalani.
Now I will always call you Shalu.
And henceforth, you can eat before me.
Why so?
- Because I love you.
Thank you.
Brother, Prem is nowhere to be seen.
Sanjana is not here either.
They got what they wanted.
The lovebirds must be busy at some corner.
Yes, so what is wrong in that?
They both that to each other.
They love each other.
They are going to get married.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Come, let's go and have some food.
Come on.
Look, Prem and Sanjana are also back.
Come on.
The bride and the groom are also here.
Let me make an announcement.
I have decided that this marriage won't take place.
What?
What?
Once again uncle must have gone into the 100 crore loop..
..after having a little too much to drink.
Balli, what are you saying?
Keep quiet.
Keep quiet.
You are saying Balli and sacrificing me
This marriage won't take place.
If uncle doesn't want this marriage to take place then..
Without uncle, I don't want to marry like an orphan.
Since when did you become an orphan, you liar?
Here he is.
Your father is here in a three-piece suit.
He is here.
Fine.
Fine.
Fine, Ballu.
If you are breaking your that with him.
Then I will form a that with him.
What is it?
Yes, a relationship.
Henceforth, I am your father.
And I am your mother.
I'm your uncle.
I'm your aunt.
If you are falling short of relatives then I, too, shall become one?
Why..
Why would you become anyone?
You are his uncle.
Keep it fixed.
Then it is fixed.
- Yes.
Henceforth, I am his uncle.
- And I am his aunt.
Look at that.
They all are telling the truth.
Chaudharys, can't you see the truth?
Brother.
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't do this.
Don't do this.
No matter how he is, he is my uncle.
My real uncle.
I'll make him understand.
Uncle, you saw how many relatives I have now?
It won't make a difference if I have one uncle less.
Yes, uncle.
On one hand your final rites will be performed..
..and on the other my wedding ceremony.
Correct.
- But this wedding will surely take place.
Yes, so I will prepare for the wedding.
- Yes.

By the way, Prem..
- Yes?
Have you come here to show the necklace..
..your family has bought for her or to see Sanjana?
I had come to congratulate all of you.
This is the first love marriage taking place in your family.
Yes, of course.
Aryan.
You came from the hospital on the right day.
Come, I'll introduce you to Sanjana's future husband.
Don't you want to get ready?
- Ready?
Come on, go.
Go.
- I am ever ready.
Ask Sanjana.
Prem.
Prem, look who is here.
He is the one.
He is the one who hit me with his car.
I went into coma because of him.
He was the one who eloped with Sanjana.
Look, Veer, Yuvraj.
Sanjana and Prem love each other.
That means everyone is a part of Prem's conspiracy.
I'll take care of you later, you wrenched woman.
We will first..
..take care of you.
You are flying too high.
Do you love to fly?
Yes, we do.
- What will you do?
Nothing, boys.
I'll just help you fulfil your dream.
You..
Where shall I keep it?
We will have to tell brother-in-law about his true identity.
Fools, not the true identity, but a false one.
Never underestimate three things in life.
I, me and myself.
Thank you.
No one can deport the one who has the family's support.
I am someone who can drown a fish.
What can you three.. do to me?
Go, Veer.
Go, Yuvraj.
I'll see how he stops you.
Let's go.
You are sleeping even after coming out of coma?
Do you remember your name?
Aryan.
- Aryan, go into flashback.
And see what I had done to you.
Where did he go?
He left right in front of you.
Mr. Modi.
- Yes.
Mr. Modi.
- What happened?
Mr. Modi.
- What happened?
We know the truth about that scoundrel Prem.
He is not Balli's nephew.
So?
- He isn't the real Modi either.
He is my real uncle.
A Kapoor.
Uncle.
- Yes, nephew.
Uncle.
- Uncle, catch them.
We'll see you.
- We'll see you.
Prem, I'll go with you.
- You handle the ladies inside.
I'm a Modi.
I'm a Modi.
I'm a Modi.
Aryan.
Aryan, let's go.
Save us.
Save us.
One.. two.. three.
The keys.
The keys are with me.
Take it.
Come here..
Come here..
That way.
That way.
Side effects of too much rajma chawal (a rice dish).
Sorry.
O God!
Card.
Card.
- Thank you.
Call me.
No pee me.
Pee them.
Hey, stop peeing there.
Stop him.
Stop him.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Stop there.
Let's go fast.
You are a dead man.
We won't spare you.
What's this new drama.
Bye-bye!
Amar.
Sanjana reminds me of our sister Shibani today.
Yes, brother.
Our Sanjana looks so happy.
I'm ready to go to the moon for her.
What?
Uncle, looking at her I feel that I won't even need..
..the almond flavoured milk.
Dad.
You know there is a that.
A custom.
Yes, but till date I've never got that of that custom.
A need.
You, too?
- Yes.
Stop this wedding.
Dear good people, someone stop them.
Aryan, you are back from the hospital.
But who did this to you?
That beguiler, Prem.
We have been cheated in such a big way.
Why did you do this to us?
Why?
Mr. Chaudhary, this was Sanjana's mother's desire.
And there was a belief in her wish.
Her wish was that you two get Sanjana married..
..and give her your blessings.
And she believed that..
..you two brothers will unite because of this marriage.
That means you really made a fool out of us.
You cheated us with 500 crores.
That means he is not a Modi.
And they are your uncles.
Listen, you idiots.
That's what I've been telling you since so long.
But you didn't listen to me.
You didn't listen to me as well.
Then tell them now.
No, you only tell them.
God sent you down here but He forgot to give you any brains.
You didn't change even after seeing the goodness in him?
But I have changed.
From now on I will be a true uncle to Prem.
Let me see who tries to touch my nephew.
Come on.
Coming.
Here you go.
You will touch my nephew.
No, I am here to give you a hand, sir.
- Okay.
Sir, being with them till date I have only washed cars.
Being with you, I am sure I will thrash a person or two.
Great.
Great.
Come on, let's begin the thrashing.
We are the five good men..
..and you are the two evil uncles.
Hippo Amar Chaudhary, you will get crushed in their fight.
Come here.
Fools, what are you waiting for?
Shoot them all.
We have come to attend the wedding.
We support love and not hatred.
Prem has changed us.
By giving double the money.
Let's go, hired goons.
Traitors.
Prem, you continue.
It's inauspicious to stop that in the middle.
That.. that..
- The wedding vows.
The wedding vows.
The wedding vows.
Come on.
Let's go.
Priest, hurry up.
Otherwise, my father and the rest of them will get thrashed.
Come.
Can I hold it?
Shall I start walking?
Come on, son.
Priest, please hurry up.
I'll shut down your World Bank.
Fast.
Fast.
I'm safe.
No.
This will be fine, Choudhary.
This is too much.
Prem, you can get another wife..
..but you won't get another father.
Today, for the first time a woman has said something sensible.
Go, Prem.
Prem, you won't get a better chance to remove your shirt.
Show your body.
- I won't.
Why?
- He has become fat.
Fat.
What shall I say?
Enjoyed it?
Mr. Chaudhary, I am here to form relations..
..and not to break bones.
Anyway, at our place we don't even look into the eyes of senior citizens.
Raising a hand on them is a farfetched thing.
Hence, chill and relax, Mr. Chaudhary.
Chill and relax.
Saw that?
This is what is called good values.
But are miles away from it.
Yes, you only know the meaning of greed..
..selfishness and deception.
You didn't even bother about my mother, you deceased sister.
How low will you stoop for money?
My child is absolutely right.
On one hand this boy is making sacrifices for his future wife.
And on the other it's you guys..
..who since ages have been making your wives sacrifice.
I'm feeling ashamed..
..to call both of you my sons.
Shame on you.
Disgusting.
Hey old man, have you lost your mind.
Father.
Get up, father.
Father..
Don't you dare!
He is our father.
I will cut your hand if you even touch him.
And I will break your jaw if you misbehave with him.
He lied.
He cheated everyone.
And you are..
They aren't even Modis.
What difference does the name make, son?
A person is known for his deeds.
And then, when have we ever acted like Chaudharys?
We have instead demeaned the Chaudhary name.
They are the real Chaudharys.
No, we are very satisfied being Kapoors.
How can he be a Chaudhary?
He has made us fight.
Brother-in-law, we should take revenge from him.
Revenge for what?
We should seek revenge because he made us human?
We should seek revenge because..
..by changing relations he changed us.
We brothers have been enemies since ages.
But today when our father got hurt our hearts felt the pain.
Should we seek revenge for that?
We should learn from this family.
Just being a part of a family doesn't make you a dear one.
A member is a dear one when you accept him.
Sir.
Sorry.
Sir..
We hold our ears and say..
..that we will never act like goons again.
And we will never be greedy for money.
And one more thing, sir.
Mr. Modi, what is your original surname.
Kapoor.
Kapoor.
- Mr. Kapoor, please forgive us.
And accept us.
Let us be a part of this wedding along with our girl, please.
Madam.
Chaudharys plus Kapoors equals to Chapoors.
Mrs. Chapoor.
Oh, my, Mrs. Chapoor.
Someone stop her.
Ready?
Ready!
One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Ready.

Atleast someone stop me
I'm Chuck.
Here are a few things that you might need to know.
I'll be locked in solitary the rest of my life, but one thing's going to keep me warm at night.
Do you remember Hungary?
Does Chuck know about the baby?
Honey,
I haven't heard from you for a while.
I miss you.
Wherever you are, I hope you're okay, safe.
I want you to know, if you ever feel like you need a place to come home to, you have one.
- Who was that?
- Nobody.
Are we a go?
Affirmative.
- Ryker, I'm in.
- How many?
I count 11.
Copy that.
On my word, take them out, all of them.
The men in that room just slaughtered the couple that lived in this house.
Give them the opportunity, they'll kill you, too.
Now move.
Next?
Double doors, three o'clock.
The package is inside.
Ryker, the package...
The baby is the package.
Grab it and get out of there.
But what am I supposed...?
Move, Walker.
I'm your handler and that's an order.
Oh, my God, he knows.
You ready for my surprise?
Absolutely.
You know how much I love surprises.
Chuck, where are we?
Here we go, up farther.
Straight, straight.
Oh, my God, this is the house.
It's our house.
How did you do this?
The real estate agent gave me the keys so we could try it out for the weekend.
Full disclosure, I think she might have a little crush on me, so...
Chuck, this is beautiful, but we still can't afford it.
Actually, we can.
I was talking to Beckman, and apparently her offer to rejoin the CIA comes with a signing bonus, which is enough for a down payment on the house and that dresser I've been eyeing at Anthropologie.
- I don't know what to say.
- Don't say anything.
Just visualize.
Think to yourself.
"What would my life be like in such an amazing home
"with the most dashing man I've ever met?"
After a hard day's work, we come home to the sweet sounds of Nina Simone emanating from our record player, which would fit perfectly.
I don't know, say, in this corner behind me.
Open floor plan.
Great for relaxing and watching your husband cook.
Cooking and talking, talking and cooking.
This area right here, perfect for my game chairs.
Or not.
Maybe we'll talk about that, but this, this is perfect.
The door frame?
When Ellie and I were kids, our dad would measure us every year to see how tall we were getting.
I remember being so excited when I was finally taller than Ellie.
It took a while, but tenth grade was a good year for me.
What's the matter?
Something's missing, something's wrong?
Is it the game chairs?
- Beause those are negotiable.
- No, it's not that.
I want this house and I want the life that you have envisioned for us.
I want every single part of it.
It's that something urgent has come up.
What is it?
You can tell me anything.
That's just it.
This time, Chuck, I can't tell you.
There are more men coming.
Get the package and get out of there.
It's going to be okay.
Flash VS Zoom Team U-Sub.net
Chuck 5x08 Chuck Versus the Baby
Sarah, please?
Tell me where you're going, tell me what happened.
I thought we decided no more secrets, no more doing things on our own.
Your words, not mine.
I know that.
I need you to trust me on this.
It's not that I don't trust you, this is not about trust.
What's so urgent?
WhyCasey come all the way down here?
I'm gonna follow him everywhere, and I was doing something.
- Where you going, Walker?
- It's nothing.
I'll be back soon.
Just wait one second.
Hear me out.
Yes, I love you, I'm going to want to know what's going on, why this mission needs to be so secretive, why you need so many guns, but I'm willing to put all that aside.
- Really?
- Really?
Really?
Husbands ask a lot of questions.
You know who doesn't?
Carmichael Industries, and as CEO of Carmichael Industries,
I would like to offer you our services.
Pro bono, of course.
It wouldn't change anything.
There are still things I can't tell you.
You're the client, you're the boss.
Whatever this is, Walker, backup couldn't hurt.
Here's what I can tell you.
The man that we're going after, his name is Kieran Ryker, ex-CIA, very dangerous.
Before we took down Shaw, he sent a communiqué to Ryker, and I'm gonna send one back posing as Shaw so that I can set up a meet.
You're gonna stay in Castle in case anything goes wrong.
Chuck and Casey, pack your bags.
We're going to Budapest tonight.
Great, I'll bring a sweater.
Good.
You sure you can keep your mouth shut this time?
Of course.
You act like I haven't learned anything in the last four years.
I need to know what's going on with she, so I've done some research...
On Hungarian culture, cross-referenced with general horrible things that Sarah might want to keep a secret.
But didn't you tell Sarah that you wouldn't...
Wikipedia-ing facts about Hungary is harmless.
I had no idea the Rubik's Cube was invented there.
I think maybe you should give Sarah the benefit of the doubt.
Any time the two of you have ever disagreed about anything, she's been right.
I can name four or five different times...
No, I know, it's just,
I'm worried that we won't be prepared if something goes wrong, but if you're here in Castle, I guess we'll be okay.
Kind of a bummer about the timing, though.
I was supposed to have game night with Ellie and Awesome.
Alex said she was gonna come by, too...
I still don't know where her.
Why do you have to cancel?
Have game night in Castle.
Ellie and Awesome have wanted to check it out more anyway.
Ever since that last mission, they keep asking me tactical questions and using the term "ghost op" as if they know what it means.
Plus, this way, if anything does go wrong,
- we'll be ready.
- I'm on it.
I know you can't talk to Bartowski about what's really going on.
That blabbermouth can't keep a secret to save his life.
But you can tell me?
I appreciate that, John, but the less you know the better.
Really.
Sure, no problem.
Walker.
Before I hand over... the package,
I need to know what's going to happen to her.
I'm afraid that's above your pay grade.
This mission wasn't sanctioned by the CIA, was it?
We did a good thing.
The men you took out killed that girl's entire family.
She's the only heir to a massive fortune, so whoever has her has access to it.
She's the key.
And you want the money.
I know this job is the only thing in your life, but someday, you're gonna realize it's not enough, that keeping your whole life a secret from everyone who loves you is too much.
But you don't have a family.
That money's just for you.
What's going to happen to her when you take it?
She has a legitimate claim to that fortune, then she can come back at any time.
And you expect me to believe that you're gonna let her live?
You're a rotten handler, Ryker.
It's okay.
Stay.
This Ryker fellow is there anything about him you'd care to elaborate on?
Any personal details we should know about?
How he takes his coffee, for example?
You know everything that you need to know.
I'm gonna be at that cafe waiting for him to arrive.
I need the two of you to stay up here away from Ryker, surveilling the street to see if anybody else is watching me.
Okay?
Okay.
Wait.
You know what?
Sarah, not okay.
Can't we just set aside the whole CEO of Carmichael Industries for a second?
That wasn't part of the deal.
Except that I'm your husband who would do anything in the world for you, and I'm worried.
This isn't about me.
There are lives in danger because of something that...
If I tell you, I'm not only compromising their safety, but your safety, as well.
When you see Ryker, what then?
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna kill him, Chuck.
Still nothing.
I know I typically overreact to stuff like this, but there's something about this entire situation that I do not like.
This time, you might be right, Bartowski.
Did some digging.
Turns out, Ryker's whole file has been redacted.
Which means whatever happened between him and Sarah ended pretty damn badly.
- Sarah, what's going on?
- It's nothing.
I need you two to follow the waiter.
I think he might be working with Ryker.
Don't move.
We'll be right down.
Where's Sarah?
Got him.
Sarah, wait!
Where are you going?
!
Ryker figured out it was me.
I'm sorry.
I've got to go do this alone.
The waiter!
Come on!
Still no word from Chuck.
Everything must be going well on the mish.
- Your turn, bro.
- Right.
You know what?
I feel so lucky to have a lady to share my little plastic car with, and not afraid to put a couple of kids in the backseat.
Not now.
That'd be crazy.
But you know, someday.
You know, commitment is not something that I fear.
I'm keeping my options open.
I noticed.
There you are in your little pink car by yourself.
Must be so lonely.
What is going on with these two?
I thought they worked everything out.
Me, too.
- Maybe they need some alone time.
- Great.
Because if I have to spin for a new mortgage rate again, I'm going to die.
It's like we're actively wasting our baby-sitter.
Let's speed things along here.
Then you and I can have a little look-see in Castle.
- Your turn.
- Yeah, my turn.
Spin a ten, game is over.
All right.
Spin...
- a ten.
- Okay.
Millionaire Estates!
Yeah, baby!
- We won in Life.
- We did.
We'll take a little breather before the next game.
Good kids.
Our hands touched for a second, and I kind of got, like, a chill on my back.
It's kind of funny, because...
Morgan?
What am I really doing here?
I'm not here to try anything, if that's what you're asking.
Unless what you're asking is that you want me to...
That's what I'm saying, of course.
There's no quick fix for us.
It's just going to take some time.
I know that.
I totally get it.
How about a game of Sorry?
Sorry!
Once again, look who doesn't need the Intersect.
Where's Ryker?
Where the hell is he?
- Do you speak Hungarian?
- No.
Do you, Mr. "I don't need the Intersect?"
I think I got a phrase book on me somewhere.
- What are you doing?
- I got her in the deli.
What?
She wasn't busy.
It's Europe.
Would you mind asking this gentleman what his business is with Ryker?
He said this man you are asking about gave me 20,000 forint to put a note under a coffee cup.
He doesn't know anything else.
He's lying.
I think you understand every word I'm saying.
You're gonna tell me where Ryker is, or you're gonna lose a lung.
Where the hell is Ryker?
!
- Any sign of her?
- Nothing yet, sir.
You didn't think I was just gonna use the front door, did you?
I knew you wouldn't use the front door.
You tell me everything Sean told you right now.
What is that?
God, I don't know what you want.
What do you want?
What do you need?
My God.
- Hello?
- Hi, Mom.
It's me.
Honey?
Are you okay?
Where are you?
I'm in a bit of a situation here.
- Are you hurt?
- No, it's nothing like that.
I was on a mission, and...
I'm looking after a baby, and she won't stop crying, and I'm not really sure what to do.
Can you help me?
Is she wet?
No, it's not that, and I fed her an hour ago.
- Did you try rocking her?
- What?
No.
Honey, I want you to bring her close to you.
She needs to feel safe.
She needs to feel your warmth.
Okay, she's close.
Now what?
Now just rock her.
Slowly back and forth and...
This is not working.
What am I supposed to do?
Don't freak out, honey.
It's okay.
Just try singing to her.
What am I supposed to sing?
Do you remember the lullaby I used to sing to you when you were little?
I think so.
Slumber, my darling
Mother is near
Guarding your dreams from all terror and fear
Sunlight has past
And the twilight has gone
Slumber, my darling
And the night's coming on
Did it work?
Yeah, it worked, Mom.
Thank you.
Tie her up.
I have to give you credit on that fake communiqué.
Unfortunately for you, I already knew that Shaw was back in prison.
So tell me, did you just come this way to have a coffee with your old handler?
You're asking the wrong question.
Just get to the point, Ryker.
The point is that it's not about money anymore.
You know why I requested to be your handler?
Why I brought you to Budapest in the first place?
Because your file screamed loner.
You had no family to speak of, never trusted anyone.
I knew that you could keep a secret because you had no one to tell.
And you still don't, do you?
I bet no one even knows that you're here.
Do they?
And that's why you're gonna die today... unless you tell me something.
Where is she?
Shaw told me she's still alive.
Where's the girl?
What?
You don't know where she is, and you're never gonna find out.
That's why I came here.
That's all I needed.
Sir, there's a problem in the foyer.
I'm not done.
Stay with her!
You two, come with me.
- What the hell?
- They made me talk!
What are you looking at?
Sarah, are you okay?
Move.
He was just a distraction.
Let's go.
Tell me where the nukes are, Doctor.
Or should I call you...
Damian?
You may know my real name, but that doesn't mean that I'll give you my intel, Cobress.
I have ways of making you talk.
- Is this part of the bit, babe?
- No, I'm stuck.
It's my earring.
- I'm stuck!
- Okay, hold on.
All right.
- You all right?
- Yes.
What was that accent?
My British accent.
Really?
Morgan, stop.
I thought I could do this, but I can't.
If you don't want to play a game, that's okay.
You know what?
We could watch movies...
You broke up with with me in a text.
I don't know how to trust you again.
I think I should probably just go.
- Babe.
- Babe.
Maybe alone time isn't what they needed.
We have to do something.
I'm actually heading home.
No, really...
Alex, okay...
Listen, I think you're making a mistake.
You got a sec?
What's that?
Nothing...
I actually wanted to talk to you about Alex.
You're not gonna understand what I'm going through.
I don't know if you know this, but when Devon and I started dating, we took a break for a while.
- What happened?
- As you know, I was an A F model.
I got to admit, I let it go to my head.
He was a real ass.
For our first anniversary, he gave me a signed photograph of himself.
He was carrying a canoe, in nothing but suit pants.
So, I broke up with him.
I had to win her back.
I couldn't lose a woman like that.
So I pulled out all the stops.
I made a Tracy Chapman mix tape.
I got front-row tickets to Les Mis.
I even baked those little cupcakes, the kind with the peanut butter inside.
- Yeah, I like those.
- Yeah, so does she.
- Did it work?
- No.
So then what did you do?
Why did you take him back?
I don't think he knows this, but I came home from work one day, and he was sitting on my doorstep with a bunch of calla lilies, and he must have been there for hours, because he was on the phone with his mom,
and he was so sweet with her.
He really cared about what she was saying.
I just remembered that was the man I fell in love with.
Calla lilies... works every time.
- I really appreciate this, but...
- Alex, come on.
Yeah, we all make mistakes, and Morgan made some big ones.
Trust me, he loves you.
She's in pain, Morgan, but if she's the one that you love...
You just have to be yourself.
Stop trying to force it.
You are a catch, okay?
She's going to realize that soon enough.
You're up.
Feeling better?
You were kind of in and out, so I put your dresses away.
I wasn't sure if they went on the left or the right, so I went with the right.
You know that I'm not the kind of guy who says things like this, but, whatever it is that you thought you needed to hide... not telling me the truth, going out on you own like that,
I think it was a mistake.
I think that you were wrong.
You're right.
When Ryker captured me in Budapest, I kept thinking why am I doing it this way?
Why do I feel like I have to do everything on my own?
But it's what my dad taught me.
It's the way the CIA taught me, that you can only ever trust yourself.
But the truth is that I trust you completely, and I want to tell you everything.
How are you holding up?
I know what Ryker made you do.
- I know everything.
- I was just obeying orders.
There's no need to worry about that now.
Where's the package?
If I have the package in my possession, then what?
The CIA would take it into custody, and then...
Do you guarantee its protection?
You know I can't make guarantees.
The CIA keeps records on these kind of things.
Records that a man like Ryker might be able to get his hands on.
Who knows what he would do.
He's a wild card.
I'm not in possession of the package, Director.
It must be somewhere else.
This is your home, too.
It doesn't have to be this way.
Mom, I've thought a lot about this, and...
I can't stay.
Because for both of you to be safe,
I can never see you again.
When the CIA recruited me, I was on the run with Dad, and we changed our identities so much that they never knew you existed.
And we can't let them find out about you now.
When you were a little girl, all I ever wanted for you was a normal life.
But you went off with your father, and he was never one...
You never got to go trick-or-treating or play on the soccer team, or never got to go to prom or homecoming.
I just wish I could have given you at least some of that.
Don't forget this.
She likes to be wrapped up in a blanket.
It... helps her sleep.
She likes the sound of the rain.
And I've noticed that car rides.
It's okay, honey.
I'll take good care of her.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
Mom?
Yes?
Going to prom and soccer games
and all those normal things that you wanted for me... will you just make sure that she gets them?
Of course I will.
Thank you.
So the baby has been with your mom this whole time?
Yeah, now I know that they're both safe.
Ryker has no idea where she is.
He has no idea that my mom ever existed.
I'm so sorry that I never told you any of this before.
I really am.
I didn't want to put anybody else in danger.
But thank you for trusting me.
Babe, I love you.
- Who's that?
- Yeah, what was that?
That's feedback.
He knows that the baby is with my mom.
I've been looking forward to this little visit for a long time.
Let's go.
- Your call has been forwarded to...
- She's not answering.
I sent her the coordinates.
I just hope she remembers the signal.
Mom?
Mom!
Please remember the signal.
- Did you get ahold of Morgan?
- No, but I'll keep trying.
Stay there.
I've got her.
Nice apron.
Thanks.
Sorry, but this street is permit parking only.
You came so close to keeping her safe, you really did, but I'm gonna kill you and then I'm gonna kill your mom.
And then after I get that money, you know what I'm gonna do with that little girl?
Get up.
You just don't quit, do you?
But you always manage to make the same mistake.
Even when you have a team, here you are all alone.
When the hell are you gonna learn?
I'm not alone.
She'll never have nightmares and she'll never know that you existed.
She's going to have the life that she deserves, a normal one.
Sarah, thank God you're okay.
- We got Ryker's men.
- My mom saw the signal.
She must be at the coordinates I left for her.
She remembered.
Okay, this is where I make my comeback.
This is where I make my comeb...
every time, this is where I...
What?
You are good, you used cheat codes.
This is what I... no, you... come on, you put in some kind of...
I missed you.
I know.
Molly, I want you to meet someone very important.
This is your sister Sarah.
Hi, Molly.
It's nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.
- So who's this?
- This is Rex.
Hi, Rex.
I used to have a stuffed dog, too, when I was little,
I named him Bunny.
That's a funny name for a dog.
I know.
I can't even begin to tell you how excited I am that I get to meet you.
It means a lot to me, too, more than you know.
It's been so long since I've seen her.
She was always a tough little thing, you know, but I worried about her.
Growing up mostly with her father, she always kept to herself.
I know I don't know you really well yet, but thank you for giving her this.
Bartowski and his fancy Chardonnay.
Don't worry, I know where Sarah keeps the Scotch.
- Kitchen, top left cabinet.
- Nice.
You were pretty good with Molly today.
You know, I'm kind of a sweet guy when I'm not in douchey
Intersect brain-melting, life-ruining phase.
Mission accomplished today?
Yep.
Looks like Morgan finally found the right girl.
I know how he feels.
Your favorite.
- Honey, you didn't have to do that.
- I wanted to.
I'm the lucky one now...
Joining the CIA and giving up everything you did,
did you ever think it would lead you here?
No, but Chuck's taught me that every now and then, it's okay to be surprised.
It's good to have you back.
Sometimes when an agent goes through what you did,
- we lose 'em.
- You're not going to lose me, sir... but I am done with handlers.
I agree.
In fact, I think that it's time for you to become one.
I have a new assignment for you... something stateside.
You think you can handle this one?
I like it here.
Me, too.
You know, I really want the life that you imagined for us, but if we go back to the CIA, it's just going to be missions and secrets that we have no control over.
What are you saying?
I gave my life to the CIA for a really long time and I chose it over my family and my friends,
and that was the right thing for me to do at the time, but I'm different now.
You know, things have changed.
You've changed me.
I don't want to go back.
I want to turn down Beckman's offer.
We don't need that bonus and we don't need this house because all we need is each other.
What are you doing?
I am carving our names into the frame.
Honey, you know we don't own this home.
I know, but we will one day.
Might not be tomorrow or the next day, and it might take us months or years of hard work, but one day this will all be ours.
And when it is, I would like to always remember this moment.
So what do you say?
You still in?
Hi, I'm Chuck.
Here are a few things that you might need to know.
I'll be locked in solitary the rest of my life, but one thing's going to keep me warm at night.
Do you remember Hungary?
Does Chuck know about the baby?
Hey, honey,
I haven't heard from you for a while.
I miss you.
Wherever you are, I hope you're okay, safe.
I want you to know, if you ever feel like you need a place to come home to, well, you have one.
Who was that?
Nobody.
Are we a go?
Affirmative.
Ryker, I'm in.
How many?
I count 11.
Copy that.
On my word, take them out, all of them.
The men in that room just slaughtered the couple that lived in this house.
Give them the opportunity, they'll kill you, too.
Now move.
♪
Next?
Double doors, three o'clock.
The package is inside.
Ryker, th-the package...
The baby is the package.
Grab it and get out of there.
But what am, what am I supposed...?
Move, Walker.
I'm your handler and that's an order.
Oh, my God, he knows.
Hey, honey.
You ready for my big surprise?
Absolutely.
You know how much I love surprises.
Chuck, where are we?
Okay, here we go, up farther.
Straight, straight, straight, straight, and ta-dah!
Oh, my God, this is the house.
It's our house.
How, how did you do this?
The real estate agent gave me the keys so we could try it out for the weekend.
Um, full disclosure--
I think she might have a little crush on me, so...
Chuck, this is, this is beautiful, but we still can't afford it.
Actually, we can.
I was talking to Beckman, and apparently her offer to rejoin the CIA comes with a signing bonus, which is enough for a down payment on the house and that dresser I've been eyeing at Anthropologie.
Uh, I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
Just visualize.
Think to yourself,
"What would my life be like in such an amazing home with the most dashing man I've ever met?"
Okay.
All right, all right, so after a hard day's work, we come home to the sweet, sweet sounds of Nina Simone emanating from our record player, which would fit perfectly-- I don't know--
say, in this corner right behind me.
Huh?
Open floor plan-- great for relaxing and watching your husband cook.
Cooking and talking, talking and cooking.
This area right here-- perfect for my game chairs.
Or not.
Maybe we'll talk about that, but this, this is perfect.
The door frame?
When Ellie and I were kids, our dad would measure us every year to see how tall we were getting.
I remember being so excited when I was finally taller than Ellie.
It took a while, but tenth grade was a good year for me.
What's the matter, what's the matter, what have I done?
Something-Something's missing, something's wrong?
Is it the game chairs?
'Cause those are negotiable.
No, Chuck, it's not that.
Um, look, I want this house and I want the life that you have envisioned for us.
I want every single part of it.
It's just that something urgent has come up.
What is it?
You know you can tell me anything.
Well, that's just it.
This time, Chuck, I can't tell you.
There are more men coming.
Get the package and get out of there.
It's going to be okay.

Sarah.
Sarah, please?
just, just tell me where you're going, tell me what happened.
I thought we decided no more secrets, no more doing things on our own.
Your words, not mine.
Look, I know, I know that.
It's just, I need you to trust me on this.
It's not that I don't trust you, this is not about trust.
What's so urgent, Bartowski?
Yeah, why'd you make Casey come all the way down here?
You know I'm gonna follow him everywhere he goes, and I was doing something really important.
Where you going, Walker?
It's nothing;
I'll be back soon.
J-Just wait, just wait one second.
Hear me out.
Yes, I love you, so, of course,
I'm going to want to know what's going on, why this mission needs to be so secretive, why you need so many guns, but I'm willing to put all that aside.
Really?
Really?
Really?
You are not helping..!
Sure, husbands ask a lot of questions.
You know who doesn't?
Carmichael Industries, and as CEO of Carmichael Industries,
I would like to offer you our services-- pro bono, of course.
Well, it wouldn't change anything.
There are still things I can't tell you.
You're the client, you're the boss.
Whatever this is, Walker, backup couldn't hurt.
Okay, here's what I can tell you.
The man that we're going after-- his name is Kieran Ryker-- ex-CIA, very dangerous.
Before we took down Shaw, he sent a communiqué to Ryker, and I'm gonna send one back posing as Shaw so that I can set up a meet.
Morgan, you're gonna stay in Castle in case anything goes wrong.
Chuck and Casey, pack your bags.
We're going to Budapest tonight.
All right, great, I'll bring a sweater.
Good.
You sure you can keep your mouth shut this time?
Of course.
Geez, Casey, you act like I haven't learned anything in the last four years.
Morgan, I need to know what's going on with Sarah, so I've done some research-- research on Hungarian culture cross-referenced with general horrible things that Sarah might want to keep a secret.
But didn't you tell Sarah that you wouldn't...?
Wikipedia-ing facts about Hungary is harmless.
I, for one, had no idea the Rubik's Cube was invented there.
Sure, I just think maybe you should give Sarah the benefit of the doubt.
I mean, any time the two of you have ever disagreed about anything, she's been right.
I can name four or five different times...
No, no, no, I-I know, I know, it's just,
I'm worried that we won't be prepared if something goes wrong, but if you're here in Castle, I guess we'll be okay.
Yeah.
Kind of a bummer about the timing, though.
I was supposed to have game night with Ellie and Awesome.
Alex said she was gonna come by, too, and...
I still don't know where her and I stand.
Wait, wait, why do you have to cancel?
You don't have to cancel game night.
Have game night in Castle.
Ellie and Awesome have wanted to check it out more anyway.
Ever since that last mission, they keep asking me tactical questions and using the term "ghost op"
as if they know what it means.
Plus, this way, if anything does go wrong, we'll be ready.
I'm on it.
Thank you.
Hey, listen, I know you can't talk to Bartowski about what's really going on.
That blabbermouth can't keep a secret to save his life.
But you can tell me, hmm?
I appreciate that, John, but the less you know the better.
Really.
Sure, no problem.
Walker.
Uh... look, before I hand over...
the package,
I need to know what's going to happen to her.
I'm afraid that's above your pay grade.
This mission wasn't sanctioned by the CIA, was it?
Look, we did a good thing.
The men you took out killed that girl's entire family.
She's the only heir to a massive fortune, so whoever has her has access to it.
She's the key.
And you want the money.
Listen, I know this job is the only thing in your life, but someday you're gonna realize it's not enough, that keeping your whole life a secret from everyone who loves you is too much.
But you don't have a family.
That money's just for you.
And what's going to happen to her when you take it?
She has a legitimate claim to that fortune, then she can come back at any time and take it from you.
And you expect me to believe that you're gonna let her live?
You're a rotten handler, Ryker.
Okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Shh.
Stay.
Stay.
So, uh, honey, this Ryker fellow-- is there anything about him you'd care to elaborate on?
Any personal details we should know about?
How he takes his coffee, for example?
No.
You know everything that you need to know.
Okay, I'm gonna be at that cafe waiting for him to arrive.
I need the two of you to stay up here away from Ryker, surveilling the street to see if anybody else is watching me.
Okay?
O-kay.
No.
Wait.
No.
You know what, Sarah?
Sarah, no, not okay.
Can't we just set aside the whole
CEO of Carmichael Industries thing just for a second?
No, Chuck, that wasn't part of the deal.
Yeah, except that I'm your husband who would do anything in the world for you, and I'm worried.
Okay, look, this isn't about me.
There are lives in danger because of something that...
Look, if I tell you, I'm not only compromising their safety, but your safety, as well.
Okay, so, when you see Ryker, what then?
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna kill him, Chuck.
Still nothing.
Look, I know I typically overreact to stuff like this, but there's something about this entire situation that I do not like.
This time, you might be right, Bartowski.
Did some digging.
Turns out, Ryker's whole file has been redacted.
Which means whatever happened between him and Sarah ended pretty damn badly.
Sarah, what's going on?
Um, it's nothing.
I need you two to follow the waiter.
I think he might be working with Ryker.
Don't move.
We'll be right down.
Where...
Where is Sarah?
Got him.
Sarah, wait, wait!
Wait.
Where are you going?
!
Ryker figured out it was me.
I'm sorry.
I've got to go do this alone.
The waiter!
Come on, come on!
Still no word from Chuck.
Everything must be going well on the mish.
Your turn, bro.
Oh, right.
Okay.
You know what?
I feel so lucky to have a lady to share my little plastic car with, and, uh, not afraid to put a couple of kids in the backseat.
Not now, obviously.
That'd be crazy.
But you know, someday.
You know, commitment is not something that I fear.
Well, I'm keeping my options open.
Yeah, I noticed.
There you are in your little pink car by yourself.
Must be so lonely.
What is going on with these two?
I thought they worked everything out.
Me, too.
Maybe they need some alone time.
Great.
Because if I have to spin for a new mortgage rate again, I'm going to die.
It's like we're actively wasting our baby-sitter.
Okay, let's, uh...
let's speed things along here.
Then you and I can have
- a little look-see in Castle.
- Ellie?
Hmm?
Uh, your turn.
Yeah, my turn.
Hey, spin a ten, game is over.
All right.
Spin a ten.
Okay.
Oh!
Millionaire Estates!
Yay!
Yeah, baby!
We won in Life.
We did.
Yeah.
Okay.
We'll take a little breather before the next game, guys.
Bye.
Yeah, good, good.
Good kids.
Oh!
Our hands touched for a second, and I kind of got, like, a chill on my back.
It's kind of funny, 'cause...
Morgan?
Mm?
What am I really doing here?
I'm-I'm not here to try anything, if that's what you're asking.
Unless what you're asking is that you want me to...
- No.
That's what I'm saying-- no, of course.
Uh...
There's no quick fix for us.
It's just going to take some time.
I know that.
Hey, I totally get it.
How about a game of Sorry?
Sorry!
Sorry!
Sorry!
Come back.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Ahh!
Whoa!
Yeah!
Once again, look who doesn't need the Intersect.
Where's Ryker?
Where the hell is he?
Do you speak Hungarian?
No.
Do you, Mr. "I don't need the Intersect?"
I think I got a phrase book on me somewhere.
Uh...
What are you doing?
I got her in the deli.
What?
She wasn't busy.
It's Europe.
Would you mind asking this gentleman what his business is with Ryker?
He said this man you are asking about gave me 20,000 forint to put a note under a coffee cup.
He doesn't know anything else.
He's lying.
I think you understand every word I'm saying.
You're gonna tell me where Ryker is, or you're gonna lose a lung.
Where the hell is Ryker?
!
Any sign of her?
Nothing yet, sir.
You didn't think
I was just gonna use the front door, did you?
I knew you wouldn't use the front door.
You tell me everything Shaw told you right now.
What is that?
Oh, God, I don't know what you want.
What do you want?
What do you need?
Oh, my God.
Okay.
Okay.
Um...
Hello?
Uh, hi, Mom.
It's me.
Honey?
Are you okay?
Where are you?
I'm just...
I'm uh...
I'm in a bit of a situation here.
Are you hurt?
Uh, no, no, no, no, it's nothing like that.
I was on a mission, and, um...
Well, I'm looking after a baby, and she won't stop crying, and I'm not really sure what to do.
Can you please help me?
Okay.
Uh, yeah.
Um, is she wet?
Uh, no.
No, it's not that, and I... and I fed her an hour ago.
Did you try rocking her?
What?
No.
Okay, honey, I want you to bring her close to you.
She needs to feel safe.
She needs to feel your warmth.
Okay.
Okay, she's close.
Now what?
Okay, now just-just rock her.
Slowly back and forth and...
Mom, this is not working.
I'm not good at this.
What am I supposed to do?
Don't freak out, honey.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Just, um...
Just try singing to her.
Um... what am I supposed to sing?
Do you remember the lullaby
I used to sing to you when you were little?
Yeah.
Uh, I-I think so.
♪ Slumber, my darling
♪ Your mother is near
♪ Guarding your dreams from all terror and fear ♪
♪ Sunlight has past and the twilight has gone ♪
♪ Slumber, my darling
♪ And the night's coming on.
Did it work?
Yeah.
Yeah, it worked, Mom.
Thank you.
Tie her up.
I have to give you credit on that fake communiqué.
Unfortunately for you, I already knew that Shaw was back in prison.
So tell me, did you just come all this way to have a cup of coffee with your old handler?
You're asking the wrong question.
Just get to the point, Ryker.
The point is that it's not about money anymore.
You know why
I requested to be your handler?
Why I brought you to Budapest in the first place?
Because your file screamed loner.
You had no family to speak of, never trusted anyone.
I knew that you could keep a secret because you had no one to tell.
And you still don't, do you?
I bet no one even knows that you're here.
Do they?
And that's why you're gonna die today... unless you tell me something.
Where is she?
Shaw told me she's still alive.
Where's the little girl?
What?
You don't know where she is, and you're never gonna find out.
That's why I came here.
That's all I needed to know.
Sir, there's a problem in the foyer.
I'm not done with you.
Stay with her!
You two, come with me.
What the hell?
They made me talk!
What are you looking at?
Sarah?
Sarah, baby, are you okay?
Move.
He was just a distraction.
Let's go.
Tell me where the nukes are, Doctor.
Or should I call you...
Damian?
You may know my real name, but that doesn't mean that I'll give you my intel, Cobress.
Well, I have ways of making you talk.
Oh, okay.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Okay, okay.
Is this... is this part of the bit, babe?
No, I'm stuck.
It's my earring.
I'm stuck...
Ow.
Okay, hold on, hold on.
All right.
Oh!
Ah!
You all right?
Yes.
What was that accent?
Oy.
My British accent.
- Really?
- Morgan, stop.
I thought I could do this, but I can't.
If you don't...
if you don't want to play a game, that's okay.
You know what we could do?
We could watch a movie.
We could watcha bunch of movies...
You broke up with with me in a text.
I don't know how to trust you again.
I think I should probably just go.
Babe.
Babe.
Maybe alone time isn't what they needed.
We have to do something.
Yeah.
Hey, there.
Hey.
I'm actually heading home.
No, really.
I'm...
Alex, okay...
Devon, really, I...
Listen, I think you're making a mistake.
Hey, you got a sec?
What's that?
What?
That...
Oh.
Uh, nothing.
Just...
Um, I actually wanted to talk to you about Alex.
I don't think you're gonna understand what I'm going through here.
I don't know if you know this, but when Devon and I first started dating, we took a break for a while.
What happened?
As you probably know, I was an A F model.
I got to admit, I let it go to my head.
He was a real ass.
For our first anniversary, he gave me a signed photograph of himself.
He was carrying a canoe in, in nothing but suit pants.
And so I just, I broke up with him.
I had to win her back.
You know, I couldn't lose a woman like that.
So I pulled out all the stops.
I made a Tracy Chapman mix tape;
I got front-row tickets to Les Mis.
I even baked those little cupcakes, you know, the kind with the peanut butter inside.
Oh, yeah, I like those.
Yeah, so does she.
Did it work?
Uh, no.
So then what did you do?
I mean, why did you take him back?
I don't think he knows this, but I came home from work one day, and he was sitting on my doorstep with a bunch of calla lilies, and he must have been there for hours, because he was on the phone with his mom,
and he was so sweet with her.
He really cared about what she was saying.
I just remembered that that was the man I fell in love with.
Calla lilies-- works every time.
Devon, I really appreciate this, but I've got to...
No, Alex, come on.
Yeah, we all make mistakes, and Morgan made some big ones.
Yeah.
Trust me, he loves you.
She's in pain, Morgan, but if she's the one that you love, just... you just have to be yourself.
Stop trying to force it.
You are a catch, okay?
She's going to realize that soon enough.
Hey.
You're up.
Feeling better?
Yeah.
You were kind of in and out a little, so I took the liberty of putting your dresses away.
I wasn't sure if they went on the left or the right, so I went with the right.
Uh, Sarah, look...
You-you know that I'm,
I'm not the kind of guy who says things like this, but... whatever it is that you thought you needed to hide... not telling me the truth, going out on you own like that,
I think it was, uh... a mistake.
I think that you were wrong.
You're right.
When Ryker captured me in Budapest, I kept thinking why am I doing it this way?
Why do I feel like I have to do everything on my own?
But it's what my dad taught me.
It's the way the CIA taught me, that you can only ever trust yourself.
But the truth is that I trust you completely, and I want to tell you everything.
Hello?
How are you holding up?
Look, I know what Ryker made you do.
I know everything.
I was just obeying orders.
There's no need to worry about that now.
Where's the package?
If I have the package in my possession, then what?
The CIA would take it into custody, and then...
Do you guarantee its protection?
You know I can't make guarantees.
The CIA keeps records on these kind of things.
Records that a man like Ryker might be able to get his hands on.
And who knows what he would do.
He's a wild card.
Agent Walker?
Sarah?
I'm not in possession of the package, Director.
It must be somewhere else.
This is your home, too.
It doesn't have to be this way.
Mom, I've thought a lot about this, and, uh, and...
I can't stay.
Because for both of you to be safe, well, I can never see you again.
When the CIA recruited me, I was on the run with Dad, and we changed our identities so much that they never knew you existed.
And we can't let them find out about you now.
When you were a little girl, all I ever wanted for you was a normal life.
But you went off with your father, and he was never one...
You just... you never got to go trick-or-treating or play on the soccer team, or never got to go to prom or homecoming.
I just wish I could have given you at least some of that.
Oh, um... don't forget this.
She likes to be wrapped up in a blanket.
It... helps her sleep.
And the sound of the rain-- she likes the sound of the rain.
And I've noticed that car rides...
It's okay, honey.
I'll take good care of her.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
Um, Mom?
Yes?
Going to prom and...
and soccer games and... and... and all those normal things that you wanted for me--
...will you just make sure that she gets them?
Of course I will.
Thank you.
So the baby has been with your mom this whole time?
Yeah.
Yeah, now I know that they're both safe.
Ryker has no idea where she is.
He has no idea that my mom ever existed.
I'm so sorry that I never told you any of this before.
I really am.
I just...
I didn't want to put anybody else in danger.
But thank you for trusting me.
Babe, I love you.
Who's that?
Yeah, what was that?
That's feedback.
Ryker.
Oh, my God, he knows that the baby is with my mom.
I've been looking forward to this little visit for a long time.
Let's go.
Your call has been forwarded to an automated...
She's not answering.
I sent her the coordinates.
I just hope she remembers the signal.
Mom?
Mom!
Please remember the signal, please.
Did you get ahold of Morgan?
Not yet, but I'll keep trying.
Stay there.
I've got her.
Nice apron.
Thanks.

No.
No, but, uh, Chuck's taught me that every now and then, it's okay to be surprised.
You just love putting me in my place, don't you?
Yeah.
It's good to have you back, Agent Walker.
Sometimes when an agent goes through what you did, we lose 'em.
Well, you're not going to lose me, sir... but I am done with handlers.
Oh, I agree.
In fact, I think that it's time for you to become one.
I have a new assignment for you-- something stateside.
You think you can handle this one?
I like it here.
Me, too.
You know, I, I really want the life that you imagined for us,

- I count 11.
RYKER:
Copy that.
On my word, take them out.
All of them.
The men in that room slaughtered the couple that lived in this house.
Given the opportunity, they'll kill you too.
Now move.
- Next?
RYKER:
Double doors.
Three o'clock.
The package is inside.
[COOING]
Ryker, the package.....
The baby is the package.
Grab it and get out of there.
But what am I supposed...?
Move, Walker.
I'm your handler and that's an order.
Oh, my God.
He knows.
[DOOR OPENS AND FOOTSTEPS APPROACH]
CHUCK:
Hey, honey.
You ready for my big surprise?
Absolutely.
You know how much I love surprises.
Chuck, where are we?
Okay, here we go.
A little farther.
Straight, straight, straight, and ta-da.
Oh, my God, this is the house.
It's our house.
How did you do this?
The real estate agent gave me the keys so we could try it out for the weekend.
Full disclosure, I think she might have a little crush on me, so...
Chuck, this is beautiful, but we still can't afford it.
Actually, we can.
I was talking to Beckman and, apparently, her offer to rejoin the CIA comes with a signing bonus. enough for a down payment. and that dresser I've been eyeing at Anthropologie.
- Uh, I don't know what to say.
- Don't say anything.
Just visualize.
Think to yourself, "What would my life be like in such an amazing home.... ....with the most dashing man I've ever met?"
- Okay.
- All right, all right.
So after a hard day's work. we come home to the sweet, sweet sounds of Nina Simone emanating from our record player. which would fit, I don't know, say, in this corner right behind me, huh?
Open floor plan, great for relaxing and watching your husband cook.
Cooking and talking, talking and cooking.
This area right here, perfect for my game chairs.
Or not.
Ahem.
Maybe.
We'll talk about that.
But this......
This is perfect.
The doorframe?
When Ellie and I were kids our dad would measure us to see how tall we were getting.
I remember being so excited when I was finally taller than Ellie.
It took a while, but tenth grade was a good year for me.
What's the matter?
What have I done?
Something's missing?
Wrong?
- The game chairs?
Those are negotiable.
- No, Chuck, it's not that.
Um...
Look, I want this house and the life that you have envisioned for us.
I want every single part of it.
It's just that something urgent has come up.
What is it?
You know you can tell me anything.
Well, that's just it.
This time, Chuck, I can't tell you.
[BABY CRYING]
There are more men coming.
Get the package and get out of there.
MAN [IN HUNGARIAN]:
It's gonna be okay.
Sarah.
Sarah, please.
Just tell me where you're going.
Tell me what happened.
We decided no more secrets, no more doing things on our own.
Your words.
I know.
I know that.
It's just...
I need you to trust me on this.
- It's not that I don't trust you.
CASEY:
What's so urgent, Bartowski?
Yeah, why make Casey come down here?
I'm gonna follow everywhere, and I was doing something important.
[WHISPERING] No, I wasn't.
- Where you going, Walker?
- I'll be back.
Just wait.
Just wait one second.
Hear me out.
Yes, I love you, so, of course, I'm going to wanna know what's going on.... ...why this mission needs to be so secretive, why you need so many guns.... ...but I'm willing to put that aside.
- Really?
- Really?
- Really?
[WHISPERING] You're not helping.
[IN NORMALVOICE] Husbands ask a lot of questions.
Who doesn't?
Carmichael Industries.
And as CEO of Carmichael Industries, I would like to offer you our services.
Pro bono, of course.
It wouldn't change anything.
There are things I can't tell you.
You're the client.
You're the boss.
What ever this is, Walker, backup couldn't hurt.
SARAH:
Here's what I can tell you.
The man that we're going after is Kieran Ryker.
Ex-CIA, very dangerous.
Before we took down Shaw, he sent a communiqué.
I'm gonna send one back as Shaw so I can set up a meet.
Morgan, you're gonna stay in Castle.
Chuck and Casey, pack your bags.
We're going to Budapest tonight.
All right.
Great.
I'll bring a sweater.
Good.
You sure you can keep your mouth shut this time?
Of course.
Jeez, Casey, you act like I haven't learned anything .in the last four years.
I need to know what's going on.
I've done some research.
Research on Hungarian culture.... ...cross-referenced with horrible things that Sarah might wanna keep a secret.
Didn't you tell Sarah you wouldn't...?
Wikipedia-ing facts about Hungary is harmless.
I had no idea the Rubik's Cube was invented there.
I just think you should give Sarah the benefit of the doubt.
Any time you disagreed about anything, she's been right.
- I can name four or five different times.
- No, I know.
It's just...
I'm worried that we won't be prepared if something goes wrong.
But if you'll be here in Castle, we'll be okay.
Yeah.
Bummer about the timing.
Supposed to have game night with Ellie and Awesome.
Alex was gonna come by too, and I still don't know where her and I stand.
Why do you have to cancel?
You don't have to.
Have game night in Castle.
Ellie and Awesome have wanted to check it out.
They keep asking me tactical questions.... ...and using the term "ghost op" as if they know what it means.
Plus, this way, if anything does go wrong, we'll be ready.
- I'm on it.
- Thank you.
Hey.
Listen, I know you can't talk to Bartowski about what's really going on.
That blabbermouth can't keep a secret to save his life, but you can tell me, hmm?
I appreciate that, John, but the less you know the better.
Really.
Sure.
No problem.
Walker.
[BABY COOING]
Uh, look, before I hand over the package.... ...I need to know what's gonna happen to her.
I'm afraid that's above your pay grade.
This mission wasn't sanctioned by the CIA, was it?
Look, we did a good thing.
The men you took out killed that girl's entire family.
She's the only heir to a massive fortune, so whoever has her has access to it.
She's the key.
And you want the money?
Listen, I know this job is everything in your life but someday you're gonna realize it's not enough. that keeping your whole life a secret from everyone who loves you .is too much.
But you don't have a family.
That money's just for you.
And what's gonna happen to her when you take it?
She has claim to that fortune.... ...and she can come back and take it from you.
And you expect me to believe that you're gonna let her live?
You're a rotten handler, Ryker.
[CROWD SHOUTING]
[CAR HORNS HONKING]
[CRYING]
Okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Stay.
Stay.
So, honey, this Ryker fellow.
Anything about him you'd care to elaborate on?
Any details we should know?
How he takes his coffee?
No.
You know everything that you need to know.
Okay, I'm gonna be at that cafe waiting for him.
I need the two of you to stay here surveilling the street to see if anybody is watching me.
Okay.
No.
Wait.
No.
You know what, Sarah?
Sarah, no.
Not okay.
Can't we just set aside the whole CEO of Carmichael Industries thing?
That wasn't the deal.
I'm your husband who would do anything for you, and I'm worried.
Okay, look, this isn't about me.
There are lives in danger because of something that...
If I tell you, I'm not only compromising their safety, but your safety as well.
Okay, so, when you see Ryker, what then?
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna kill him, Chuck.
CHUCK:
Still nothing.
I know I overreact to stuff like this.... ....but there's something about this that I do not like.
This time, you might be right, Bartowski.
Did some digging.
Turns out, Ryker's whole file's been redacted.
Which means whatever happened between him and Sarah ended badly.
[IN HUNGARIAN]
- Sarah, what's going on?
- It's nothing.
I need you to follow the waiter.
I think he may be working with Ryker.
CHUCK:
Don't move.
We'll be right down.
Where...?
Where's Sarah?
Got him.
Sarah, wait.
Wait.
Wait, where are you going?
Ryker figured out it was me.
I'm sorry.
I gotta go do this alone.
The waiter.
Come on.
Come on.
No word from Chuck.
Everything must be going well on the mish.
- Your turn, bro.
- All right.
Okay.
You know what?
I feel so lucky to have a lady .to share my little plastic car with.
And not afraid to put a couple of kids in the backseat.
Not now, obviously.
That'd be crazy.
But someday.
You know, commitment is not something that I fear.
Well, I'm keeping my options open.
I noticed.
There you are in your little pink car by yourself.
Must be so lonely.
What is going on?
- I thought they worked everything out.
- Me too.
Maybe they need some alone time.
Great.
Because if I have to spin for a new mortgage rate again, I'm going to die.
We're actively wasting our babysitter.
Okay, let's speed things along here.
Then you and I can have a little look-see in the Castle.
MORGAN:
Ellie.
- Your turn.
- Yeah, my turn.
Hey, spin a ten, game is over.
- Honey, spin a ten.
- Okay.
Ha, ha.
[GROANS]
Millionaire Estates!
Yay!
- Yeah, baby.
- We won at Life.
- We did.
- Yeah.
Okay.
We'll take a little breather before the next game.
- Bye.
- Good kids.
Heh, heh.
Oh!
Our hands touched for a second, and I kind of got, like, a chill on my back.
It's kind of funny, just because......
Morgan.
What am I really doing here?
I'm not here to try anything, if that's what you're asking.
Unless what you're asking is that you want me to...
- No.
- That's what I'm saying.
No, of course.
There's no quick fix for us.
It's just gonna take some time.
I know that.
Hey, I totally get it.
How about a game of Sorry!
?
CHUCK:
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
[SHOUTS]
Whoo!
Yeah.
Once again, look who doesn't need the Intersect.
Where's Ryker?
Where the hell is he?
[SPEAKING IN HUNGARIAN]
- Do you speak Hungarian?
- No.
Do you, Mr. I-Don't-Need-The-Intersect?
I think I got a phrase book on me somewhere.
[IN HUNGARIAN]
What are you doing?
I got her in the deli.
What?
She wasn't busy.
It's Europe.
Would you mind asking this gentleman what his business is with Ryker?
[IN HUNGARIAN]
[SPEAKING IN HUNGARIAN]
He said this man you are asking about gave him 20,000 forint to put a note under a coffee cup.
He doesn't know anything else.
He's lying.
I think you understand every word I'm saying.
You're gonna tell me where Ryker is or you're gonna lose a lung.
Where the hell is Ryker?
- Any sign of her?
MAN:
Nothing yet, sir.
You didn't think I was gonna use the front door, did you?
I knew you wouldn't use the front door.
You tell me everything Shaw told you right now.
[BABY CRYING NEARBY]
What is that?
[CRYING]
Oh, God, I don't know what you want.
What do you want?
What do you need?
Oh, my God.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
[RINGING]
WOMAN:
Hello?
- Hi, Mom.
It's me.
Honey?
Are you okay?
- Where are you?
- I'm just...
I'm in a bit of a situation here.
- Are you hurt?
- No, no, no, it's nothing like that.
I was on a mission and......
I'm looking after a baby.
She won't stop crying.
I'm not sure what to do.
Can you help me?
Okay.
Uh, yeah.
Is she wet?
Uh, no.
No, it's not that, and I fed her an hour ago.
- Did you try rocking her?
- What?
No.
Okay, honey, I want you to bring her close to you.
She needs to feel safe.
- She needs to feel your warmth.
- Okay.
Okay, she's close.
Now what?
Okay, now, just rock her.
Slowly, back and forth and...
This is not working.
I'm not good at this.
What am I supposed to do?
Don't freak out, honey.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Just, um......
Just try singing to her.
Um, what am I supposed to sing?
Do you remember the lullaby I used to sing to you when you were little?
Yeah.
Uh, I think so.
[SINGING] Slumber, my darling
Mother is here Guarding your dreams
From all terror and fear
Sunlight has passed And the twilight has gone
Slumber my darling
And the night's coming on
Did it work?
Yeah.
Yeah, it worked, Mom.
Thank you.
[BABY CRYING]
[GRUNTS]
[BABY CRYING ON RECORDING]
[RECORDING STOPS]
RYKER:
Tie her up.
I have to give you credit on that fake communiqué.
Unfortunately for you, I already knew that Shaw was back in prison.
So tell me, did you just come all this way.... ...to have a cup of coffee with your old handler?
You're asking the wrong question.
Just get to the point, Ryker.
The point is that it's not about money anymore.
You know why I requested to be your handler?
Why I brought you to Budapest in the first place?
Because your file screamed "loner."
You had no family to speak of, never trusted anyone.
I knew that you could keep a secret because you had no one to tell.
Uh-huh.
And you still don't, do you?
I bet no one even knows that you're here.
Do they?
And that's why you're gonna die today.
Unless you tell me something.
Where is she?
Shaw told me she's still alive.
Where's the little girl?
What?
You don't know where she is and you're never gonna find out.
That's why I came here.
That's all I needed to know.
MAN:
Sir, there's a problem in the foyer.
[GRUNTS]
I'm not done with you.
Stay with her.
You two come with me.
- What the hell?
- They made me talk.
[SCREAMS]
- What are you looking at?
- Sarah.
Sarah, baby, are you okay?
Move.
He was just a distraction.
Let's go.
Tell me where the nukes are, doctor.
Or should I call you Damian?
[IN BRITISH ACCENT] You may know my real name but that doesn't mean that I'll give you my intel, Cobress.
Well, I have ways of making you talk.
Oh, okay.
Ow, ow, ow.
- Is this part of the bit, babe?
- No, I'm stuck.
It's my earring.
- I'm stuck.
- Okay.
Hold on, hold on.
All right.
[GROANS]
- You all right?
- Yes.
What was that accent?
- My British accent.
- Really?
ALEX:
Morgan, stop.
I thought I could do this, but I can't.
MORGAN:
If you don't want to play a game, that's okay.
You know what?
We could watch a movie.
You broke up with me in a text.
I don't know how to trust you again.
I think I should probably just go.
- Babe.
- Babe.
Maybe alone time isn't what they needed.
- We have to do something.
- Yeah.
- Hey there.
- Hey.
I'm actually heading home.
No...
- Devon, really...
DEVON:
I think you're making a mistake.
ELLIE:
Hey, you got a sec?
- What's that?
- What?
- The...
- Oh, nothing.
Just.....
I actually wanted to talk to you about Alex.
I don't think you're gonna understand what I'm going through here.
I don't know if you know this, but when Devon and I started dating.... ....we took a break for a while.
ALEX:
What happened?
As you probably know, I was an A F model.
I gotta admit, I let it go to my head.
ELLIE:
He was a real ass.
For our first anniversary, he gave me a signed photograph of himself.
He was carrying a canoe in nothing but suit pants.
So I broke up with him.
I had to win her back.
I couldn't lose a woman like that.
So I pulled out all the stops.
I made a Tracy Chapman mix tape.
You know, got front-row tickets to Les Mis.
I even baked those little cupcakes with the peanut butter inside.
- Yeah, I like those.
- Yeah, so does she.
- Did it work?
- No.
So then what did he do?
I mean, why did you take him back?
I don't think he knows this, but I came home from work one day .and he was sitting on my doorstep with a bunch of calla lilies.
He must have been there for hours.
He was on the phone with his mom.... ....and he was so sweet with her.
He really cared about what she was saying.
I remembered that was the man I fell in love with.
Calla lilies.
Works every time.
- Devon, I appreciate this, but I gotta...
- No, Alex, come on.
Now, yeah, we all make mistakes, and Morgan made some big ones.
- Yeah.
- Trust me, he loves you.
She's in pain, Morgan, but if she's the one that you love, just...
You just have to be yourself.
Stop trying to force it.
You are a catch, okay?
She's gonna realize that soon enough.
[CLATTERING]
- Hey.
You're up.
Feeling better?
- Yeah.
You were in and out, so I took the liberty of putting your dresses away.
I wasn't sure if they went on the left or the right, so I went with the right.
Uh, Sarah, look.
You know that I'm not the kind of guy who says things like this.... ...but whatever it is that you thought you needed to hide.... ...not telling me the truth, going out on your own like that.... ....
I think it was a mistake.
I think that you were wrong.
You're right.
When Ryker captured me in Budapest, I kept thinking:
"Why am I doing it this way?
Why do I feel like I have to do everything on my own?"
But it's what my dad taught me, the way the CIA taught me that you can only ever trust yourself.
But the truth is that I trust you completely.... ....and I wanna tell you everything.
[BABY COOING]
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
Hello?
GRAHAM:
How are you holding up?
Look, I know what Ryker made you do.
I know everything.
I was just obeying orders.
There's no need to worry about that now.
Where's the package?
If I had the package in my possession, then what?
CIA would take it into custody, and then...
- Could you guarantee its protection?
- You know I can't make guarantees.
The CIA keeps records on these kind of things.
Records that a man like Ryker might be able to get his hands on.
And who knows what he would do.
He's a wild card.
Agent Walker?
Sarah.
I'm not in possession of the package, director.
It must be somewhere else.
MOTHER:
This is your home too.
It doesn't have to be this way.
Mom, I've thought a lot about this.... ....and I can't stay.
Because for both of you to be safe.... ....well, I can never see you again.
When the CIA recruited me, I was on the run with Dad.
We changed identities so much they never knew you existed.
And we can't let them find out about you now.
When you were a little girl, all I ever wanted for you was a normal life.
But you went off with your father, and he was never one to......
You just...
You never got to go trick-or-treating.... ....or play on the soccer team or.....
Never got to go to prom or homecoming.
Ljust wish I could have given you at least some of that.
Don't forget this.
Um, yeah, she likes to be wrapped up in a blanket.
It helps her sleep.
She likes the sound of the rain.
And I've noticed...
It's okay, honey.
I'll take good care of her.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
Mom?
Yes?
Going to prom and soccer games.... ...and all those normal things that you wanted for me.....
Will you just make sure that she gets them?
Of course I will.
Thank you.
So the baby has been with your mom this whole time?
Yeah.
Yeah, now I know that they're both safe.
Ryker has no idea where she is.
He has no idea that my mom ever existed.
I'm so sorry that I never told you any of this before.
I really am.
I just...
I didn't wanna put anybody else in danger.
But thank you for trusting me.
Babe, I love you.
[FEEDBACK BUZZING]
- What was that?
- Yeah, what was that?
That's feedback.
[MOUTHS] It's a bug.
Ryker.
Oh, my God, he knows that the baby is with my mom.
I've been looking forward to this little visit for a long time.
Let's go.
WOMAN:
Your call has been forwarded to an aut...
She's not answering.
I sent her coordinates.
I just hope she remembers the signal.
[DEVICE BLEEPING]
Mom?
Mom?
Please remember the signal.
Please.
- Did you get a hold of Morgan?
- Not yet, but I'll keep trying him.
Stay there.
[DISHES CLATTERING AND WATER RUNNING]
I've got her.
- Nice apron.
- Thanks.
Guys, this street is permit parking only.
You're gonna have to move your vehicle.
[GRUNTING AND SHOUTING]
You came so close to keeping her safe, you really did.
But I'm gonna kill you.
And then I'm gonna kill your mom.
And then after I get that money.... ...you know what I'm gonna do with that little girl?
Hmm?
Get up.
You just don't quit, do you?
But you always manage to make the same mistake.
Even when you have a team, here you are all alone.
When the hell are you gonna learn?
[GUNFIRE]
[SARAH GRUNTS]
I'm not alone.
She'll never have nightmares.
And she'll never even know that you existed.
She's gonna have the life that she deserves.
A normal one.
[MEN GRUNTING AND SHOUTING]
- Sarah.
Thank God you're okay.
- We got Ryker's men.
My mom saw the signal.
She must be at the coordinates I left.
She remembered.
Okay, this is where I make my comeback now.
This is where I make my come...
Every time, this is where l...
What?
You are good.
You are good.
You're using cheat codes.
This is what I...
No, you...
Come on, you...
What?
Some kind of...
I missed you.
I know.
Molly, I want you to meet someone very important.
This is your sister.
Sarah.
Hi, Molly.
It's nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.
[CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]
- Who's this?
- This is Rex.
Hi, Rex.
I used to have a stuffed dog too, when I was little and I named him Bunny.
That's a funny name for a dog.
- I know.
Ha, ha.
- Heh, heh.
You know, I can't even begin to tell you how excited I am that I get to meet you.
It means a lot to me too.
More than you know.
It's been so long since I've seen her.
She was always a tough little thing, you know.
But I worried about her.
Growing up mostly with her father, she always kept to herself.
I know I don't know you really well yet, but thank you for giving her this.
I'm gonna practice.
Bartowski and his fancy chardonnay.
Don't worry.
I know where Sarah keeps the Scotch.
- Kitchen, top left cabinet.
- Nice.
You were pretty good with Molly today.
Well, you know, I'm kind of a sweet guy when I'm not in douchey Intersect brain-melting, life- ruining phase.
DEVON:
Mission accomplished today, huh?
Yep.
Looks like Morgan finally found the right girl.
I know how he feels.
- Aw.
- Your favorite.
- Honey, you didn't have to do that.
- I wanted to.
I'm the lucky one now.
Is this Dog?
- Rex.
I like that.
- Joining the CIA .and giving up everything you did did you ever think it would lead you here?
- No.
- Don't you?
Ha, ha!
No, but Chuck's taught me that every now and then, it's okay to be surprised.
It's good to have you back, Agent Walker.
Sometimes when an agent goes through what you did, we lose them.
Well, you're not gonna lose me, sir.
But I am done with handlers.
Oh, I agree.
In fact, I think that it's time for you to become one.
I have a new assignment for you.
Something stateside.
You think you can handle this one?
I like it here.
Me too.
You know, I really want the life that you imagined for us, Chuck.... ...but if we go back to the CIA.... ....it's just gonna be missions and secrets that we have no control over.
What are you saying?
I gave my life to the CIA for a really long time and I chose it over my family and my friends. .and that was the right thing for me to do at the time. .but I'm different now.
You know, things have changed.
You've changed me.
I don't wanna go back.
I wanna turn down Beckman's offer.
Okay.
Okay.
We don't need that bonus.... ....
And we don't need this house because all we need is each other.
Sarah?
Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing?
I am carving our names into the frame.
Honey, you know we don't own this home.
I know.
But we will.
One day.
Might not be tomorrow or the next day.... ....and it might take us months or years of hard work.... ....but one day this will all be ours.
And when it is, I would like to remember this moment.
So, what do you say?
You still in?
[CHUCKLES]
[English
- US
- SDH]
Hi, I'm Chuck.
Here are a few things that you might need to know.
I'll be locked in solitary the rest of my life, but one thing's going to keep me warm at night.
Do you remember Hungary?
Does Chuck know about the baby?
(thunder rumbling)
WOMAN (over voice mail):
Hey, honey,
I haven't heard from you for a while.
I miss you.
Wherever you are, I hope you're okay, safe.
I want you to know, if you ever feel like you need a place to come home to, well, you have one.
Who was that?
Nobody.
Are we a go?
Affirmative.
(men speaking Hungarian)
(all laughing)
Ryker, I'm in.
How many?
I count 11.
Copy that.
On my word, take them out, all of them.
The men in that room just slaughtered the couple that lived in this house.
Give them the opportunity, they'll kill you, too.
(men laughing)
Now move.
♪
Next?
RYKER:
Double doors, three o'clock.
The package is inside.
Ryker, th-the package...
The baby is the package.
Grab it and get out of there.
But what am, what am I supposed...?
Move, Walker.
I'm your handler and that's an order.
(thunder rumbling)
Oh, my God, he knows.
CHUCK:
Hey, honey.
You ready for my big surprise?
Absolutely.
You know how much I love surprises.
Chuck, where are we?
Okay, here we go, up farther.
Straight, straight, straight, straight, and ta-dah!
Oh, my God, this is the house.
It's our house.
How, how did you do th...?
The real estate agent gave me the keys so we could try it out for the weekend.
Um, full disclosure--
I think she might have a little crush on me, so...
Chuck, this is, this is beautiful, but we still can't afford it.
Actually, we can.
I was talking to Beckman, and apparently her offer to rejoin the CIA comes with a signing bonus, which is enough for a down payment on the house and that dresser I've been eyeing at Anthropologie.
Uh, I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
Just visualize.
Think to yourself,
"What would my life be like in such an amazing home with the most dashing man I've ever met?"
(chuckling):
Okay.
All right, all right, so after a hard day's work, we come home to the sweet, sweet sounds of Nina Simone emanating from our record player, which would fit perfectly-- I don't know--
say, in this corner right behind me.
Huh?
Open floor plan-- great for relaxing and watching your husband cook.
Cooking and talking, talking and cooking.
This area right here-- perfect for my game chairs.
Or not.
(clears throat) Maybe we'll talk about that, but this, this is perfect.
The door frame?
When Ellie and I were kids, our dad would measure us every year to see how tall we were getting.
I remember being so excited when I was finally taller than Ellie.
It took a while, but tenth grade was a good year for me.
What's the matter, what's the matter, what have I done?
Something-Something's missing, something's wrong?
Is it the game chairs?
'Cause those are negotiable.
No, Chuck, it's not that.
Um, look, I want this house and I want the life that you have envisioned for us.
I want every single part of it.
It's just that something urgent has come up.
What is it?
You know you can tell me anything.
Well, that's just it.
This time, Chuck, I can't tell you.
(baby crying)
There are more men coming.
Get the package and get out of there.
(men speaking Hungarian)
(baby crying)
It's going to be okay.

Sarah.
Sarah, please?
just, just tell me where you're going, tell me what happened.
I thought we decided no more secrets, no more doing things on our own.
Your words, not mine.
Look, I know, I know that.
It's just, I need you to trust me on this.
It's not that I don't trust you, this is not about trust.
CASEY:
What's so urgent, Bartowski?
MORGAN:
Yeah, why'd you make Casey come all the way down here?
You know I'm gonna follow him everywhere he goes, and I was doing something really important.
(mouthing)
Where you going, Walker?
It's nothing;
I'll be back soon.
J-Just wait, just wait one second.
Hear me out.
Yes, I love you, so, of course,
I'm going to want to know what's going on, why this mission needs to be so secretive, why you need so many guns, but I'm willing to put all that aside.
Really?
Really?
Really?
(mouthing)
Sure, husbands ask a lot of questions.
You know who doesn't?
Carmichael Industries, and as CEO of Carmichael Industries,
I would like to offer you our services-- pro bono, of course.
Well, it wouldn't change anything.
There are still things I can't tell you.
You're the client, you're the boss.
CASEY:
Whatever this is, Walker, backup couldn't hurt.
Okay, here's what I can tell you.
The man that we're going after-- his name is Kieran Ryker-- ex-CIA, very dangerous.
Before we took down Shaw, he sent a communiqué to Ryker, and I'm gonna send one back posing as Shaw so that I can set up a meet.
Morgan, you're gonna stay in Castle in case anything goes wrong.
Chuck and Casey, pack your bags.
We're going to Budapest tonight.
All right, great, I'll bring a sweater.
Good.
You sure you can keep your mouth shut this time?
Of course.
Geez, Casey, you act like I haven't learned anything in the last four years.
(scoffs)
Morgan, I need to know what's going on with Sarah, so I've done some research-- research on Hungarian culture cross-referenced with general horrible things that Sarah might want to keep a secret.
But didn't you tell Sarah that you wouldn't...?
Wikipedia-ing facts about Hungary is harmless.
I, for one, had no idea the Rubik's Cube was invented there.
Sure, I just think maybe you should give Sarah the benefit of the doubt.
I mean, any time the two of you have ever disagreed about anything, she's been right.
I can name four or five different times...
No, no, no, I-I know, I know, it's just,
I'm worried that we won't be prepared if something goes wrong, but if you're here in Castle, I guess we'll be okay.
Yeah.
Kind of a bummer about the timing, though.
I was supposed to have game night with Ellie and Awesome.
Alex said she was gonna come by, too, and...
I still don't know where her and I stand.
Wait, wait, why do you have to cancel?
You don't have to cancel game night.
Have game night in Castle.
Ellie and Awesome have wanted to check it out more anyway.
Ever since that last mission, they keep asking me tactical questions and using the term "ghost op"
as if they know what it means.
(groans) Plus, this way, if anything does go wrong, we'll be ready.
I'm on it.
Thank you.
Hey, listen, I know you can't talk to Bartowski about what's really going on.
That blabbermouth can't keep a secret to save his life.
But you can tell me, hmm?
I appreciate that, John, but the less you know the better.
Really.
Sure, no problem.
Walker.
(baby cooing)
Uh... look, before I hand over...
the package,
I need to know what's going to happen to her.
I'm afraid that's above your pay grade.
This mission wasn't sanctioned by the CIA, was it?
Look, we did a good thing.
The men you took out killed that girl's entire family.
She's the only heir to a massive fortune, so whoever has her has access to it.
She's the key.
And you want the money.
Listen, I know this job is the only thing in your life, but someday you're gonna realize it's not enough, that keeping your whole life a secret from everyone who loves you is too much.
But you don't have a family.
That money's just for you.
And what's going to happen to her when you take it?
She has a legitimate claim to that fortune, then she can come back at any time and take it from you.
And you expect me to believe that you're gonna let her live?
(baby crying)
You're a rotten handler, Ryker.
(crying continues)
(passersby screaming)
(horn honking)
(crying)
Okay.
(baby crying loudly)
It's okay.
It's okay.
Shh.
Stay.
Stay.
(crying continues)
CHUCK:
So, uh, honey, this Ryker fellow-- is there anything about him you'd care to elaborate on?
Any personal details we should know about?
How he takes his coffee, for example?
No.
You know everything that you need to know.
Okay, I'm gonna be at that cafe waiting for him to arrive.
I need the two of you to stay up here away from Ryker, surveilling the street to see if anybody else is watching me.
Okay?
O-kay.
No.
Wait.
No.
You know what, Sarah?
Sarah, no, not okay.
Can't we just set aside the whole
CEO of Carmichael Industries thing just for a second?
No, Chuck, that wasn't part of the deal.
Yeah, except that I'm your husband who would do anything in the world for you, and I'm worried.
Okay, look, this isn't about me.
There are lives in danger because of something that...
Look, if I tell you, I'm not only compromising their safety, but your safety, as well.
Okay, so, when you see Ryker, what then?
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna kill him, Chuck.
CHUCK:
Still nothing.
Look, I know I typically overreact to stuff like this, but there's something about this entire situation that I do not like.
This time, you might be right, Bartowski.
Did some digging.
Turns out, Ryker's whole file has been redacted.
Which means whatever happened between him and Sarah ended pretty damn badly.
(speaking Hungarian):
Sarah, what's going on?
Um, it's nothing.
I need you two to follow the waiter.
I think he might be working with Ryker.
Don't move.
We'll be right down.
Where...
Where is Sarah?
Got him.
Sarah, wait, wait!
Wait.
Where are you going?
!
Ryker figured out it was me.
I'm sorry.
I've got to go do this alone.
The waiter!
Come on, come on!
Still no word from Chuck.
Everything must be going well on the mish.
Your turn, bro.
Oh, right.
Okay.
You know what?
I feel so lucky to have a lady to share my little plastic car with, and, uh, not afraid to put a couple of kids in the backseat.
Not now, obviously.
That'd be crazy.
But you know, someday.
You know, commitment is not something that I fear.
Well, I'm keeping my options open.
Yeah, I noticed.
There you are in your little pink car by yourself.
Must be so lonely.
What is going on with these two?
I thought they worked everything out.
Me, too.
Maybe they need some alone time.
Great.
Because if I have to spin for a new mortgage rate again, I'm going to die.
It's like we're actively wasting our baby-sitter.
Okay, let's, uh...
let's speed things along here.
Then you and I can have a little look-see in Castle.
MORGAN:
Ellie?
Hmm?
Uh, your turn.
Yeah, my turn.
Hey, spin a ten, game is over.
All right.
Spin a ten.
Okay. (laughs)
Oh!
(gasps) Millionaire Estates!
Yay!
Yeah, baby!
We won in Life.
We did.
(Captain whooping)
Yeah.
Okay.
We'll take a little breather before the next game, guys.
Bye.
Yeah, good, good.
Good kids.
(chuckles)
Oh!
Our hands touched for a second, and I kind of got, like, a chill on my back.
It's kind of funny, 'cause...
Morgan?
Mm?
What am I really doing here?
I'm-I'm not here to try anything, if that's what you're asking.
Unless what you're asking is that you want me to...
- No.
That's what I'm saying-- no, of course.
Uh...
There's no quick fix for us.
It's just going to take some time.
I know that.
Hey, I totally get it.
How about a game of Sorry?
(scoffs)
Sorry!
Sorry!
Sorry!
Come back.
Sorry.
Sorry.
(yells, grunts)
Ahh!
Whoa!
Yeah!
Once again, look who doesn't need the Intersect.
Where's Ryker?
Where the hell is he?
(speaking Hungarian rapidly)
Do you speak Hungarian?
No.
Do you, Mr. "I don't need the Intersect?"
I think I got a phrase book on me somewhere.
(speaking Hungarian)
Uh... (pages turning)
(speaking Hungarian)
What are you doing?
I got her in the deli.
What?
She wasn't busy.
It's Europe.
Would you mind asking this gentleman what his business is with Ryker?
(sighs)
(speaking Hungarian)
(speaking Hungarian)
He said this man you are asking about gave me 20,000 forint to put a note under a coffee cup.
He doesn't know anything else.
He's lying.
I think you understand every word I'm saying.
You're gonna tell me where Ryker is, or you're gonna lose a lung.
Where the hell is Ryker?
!
Any sign of her?
MAN:
Nothing yet, sir.
(gun clicks)
You didn't think
I was just gonna use the front door, did you?
I knew you wouldn't use the front door.
You tell me everything Sean told you right now.
(baby crying)
What is that?
(crying)
Oh, God, I don't know what you want.
What do you want?
(thunder rumbling) What do you need?
(crying louder)
Oh, my God.
Okay.
Okay.
Um... (dialing)
(phone line ringing)
WOMAN:
Hello?
Uh, hi, Mom.
It's me.
Honey?
Are you okay?
Where are you?
I'm just...
I'm uh...
I'm in a bit of a situation here.
Are you hurt?
Uh, no, no, no, no, it's nothing like that.
I was on a mission, and, um...
Well, I'm looking after a baby, and she won't stop crying, and I'm not really sure what to do.
Can you please help me?
Okay.
Uh, yeah.
Um, is she wet?
Uh, no.
No, it's not that, and I... and I fed her an hour ago.
Did you try rocking her?
What?
No.
Okay, honey, I want you to bring her close to you.
She needs to feel safe.
She needs to feel your warmth.
(crying)
Okay.
Okay, she's close.
Now what?
Okay, now just-just rock her.
Slowly back and forth and... (continues crying)
Mom, this is not working.
I'm not good at this.
What am I supposed to do?
Don't freak out, honey.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Just, um...
Just try singing to her.
(crying)
Um... what am I supposed to sing?
Do you remember the lullaby
I used to sing to you when you were little?
Yeah.
Uh, I-I think so.
♪ Slumber, my darling
(both singing):
♪ Your mother is near
♪ Guarding your dreams from all terror and fear ♪
♪ Sunlight has past and the twilight has gone ♪
♪ Slumber, my darling
♪ And the night's coming on.
(sighs)
Did it work?
Yeah.
Yeah, it worked, Mom.
Thank you.
(baby crying)
(grunting)
(click, crying stops)
Tie her up.
(gasping)
I have to give you credit on that fake communiqué.
Unfortunately for you, I already knew that Shaw was back in prison.
So tell me, did you just come all this way to have a cup of coffee with your old handler?
You're asking the wrong question.
(agonized grunting)
Just get to the point, Ryker.
The point is that it's not about money anymore.
You know why
I requested to be your handler?
Why I brought you to Budapest in the first place?
Because your file screamed loner.
You had no family to speak of, never trusted anyone.
I knew that you could keep a secret because you had no one to tell.
(laughs)
And you still don't, do you?
I bet no one even knows that you're here.
Do they?
And that's why you're gonna die today... unless you tell me something.
Where is she?
Shaw told me she's still alive.
Where's the little girl?
What?
You don't know where she is, and you're never gonna find out.
That's why I came here.
That's all I needed to know.
MAN:
Sir, there's a problem in the foyer.
(blow lands)
(groans)
I'm not done with you.
(gasps)
Stay with her!
You two, come with me.
What the hell?
They made me talk!
(Ryker sighs)
(man screaming)
What are you looking at?
Sarah?
Sarah, baby, are you okay?
Move.
He was just a distraction.
Let's go.
Tell me where the nukes are, Doctor.
Or should I call you...
Damian?
(with British accent):
You may know my real name, but that doesn't mean that I'll give you my intel, Cobress.
Well, I have ways of making you talk.
(sighs)
Oh, okay.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Okay, okay.
Is this... is this part of the bit, babe?
No, I'm stuck.
It's my earring.
I'm stuck...
Ow.
Okay, hold on, hold on.
All right.
Oh!
Ah!
You all right?
Yes.
What was that accent?
Oy.
My British accent.
Really?
ALEX:
Morgan, stop.
I thought I could do this, but I can't.
MORGAN:
If you don't...
if you don't want to play a game, that's okay.
You know what we could do?
We could watch a movie.
We could watcha bunch of movies...
You broke up with with me in a text.
I don't know how to trust you again.
I think I should probably just go.
Babe.
Babe.
CAPTAIN:
Maybe alone time isn't what they needed.
We have to do something.
Yeah.
Hey, there.
Hey.
I'm actually heading home.
No, really.
I'm...
Alex, okay...
Devon, really, I...
Listen, I think you're making a mistake.
Hey, you got a sec?
What's that?
What?
That...
Oh.
Uh, nothing.
Just...
Um, I actually wanted to talk to you about Alex.
I don't think you're gonna understand what I'm going through here.
I don't know if you know this, but when Devon and I first started dating, we took a break for a while.
ALEX:
What happened?
As you probably know, I was an A F model.
I got to admit, I let it go to my head.
ELLIE:
He was a real ass.
For our first anniversary, he gave me a signed photograph of himself.
He was carrying a canoe in, in nothing but suit pants.
And so I just, I broke up with him.
I had to win her back.
You know, I couldn't lose a woman like that.
So I pulled out all the stops.
I made a Tracy Chapman mix tape;
I got front-row tickets to Les Mis.
I even baked those little cupcakes, you know, the kind with the peanut butter inside.
Oh, yeah, I like those.
Yeah, so does she.
Did it work?
Uh, no.
So then what did you do?
I mean, why did you take him back?
I don't think he knows this, but I came home from work one day, and he was sitting on my doorstep with a bunch of calla lilies, and he must have been there for hours, because he was on the phone with his mom,
and he was so sweet with her.
He really cared about what she was saying.
I just remembered that that was the man I fell in love with.
Calla lilies-- works every time.
Devon, I really appreciate this, but I've got to...
No, Alex, come on.
Yeah, we all make mistakes, and Morgan made some big ones.
Yeah.
Trust me, he loves you.
ELLIE:
She's in pain, Morgan, but if she's the one that you love, just... you just have to be yourself.
Stop trying to force it.
You are a catch, okay?
She's going to realize that soon enough.
(rustling)
Hey.
You're up.
Feeling better?
Yeah.
You were kind of in and out a little, so I took the liberty of putting your dresses away.
I wasn't sure if they went on the left or the right, so I went with the right.
Uh, Sarah, look...
You-you know that I'm,
I'm not the kind of guy who says things like this, but... whatever it is that you thought you needed to hide... not telling me the truth, going out on you own like that,
I think it was, uh... a mistake.
I think that you were wrong.
You're right.
When Ryker captured me in Budapest, I kept thinking why am I doing it this way?
Why do I feel like I have to do everything on my own?
But it's what my dad taught me.
It's the way the CIA taught me, that you can only ever trust yourself.
But the truth is that I trust you completely, and I want to tell you everything.
(rain falling)
(cell phone ringing)
Hello?
GRAHAM:
How are you holding up?
Look, I know what Ryker made you do.
I know everything.
I was just obeying orders.
There's no need to worry about that now.
Where's the package?
If I have the package in my possession, then what?
The CIA would take it into custody, and then...
Do you guarantee its protection?
You know I can't make guarantees.
The CIA keeps records on these kind of things.
Records that a man like Ryker might be able to get his hands on.
And who knows what he would do.
He's a wild card.
Agent Walker?
Sarah?
I'm not in possession of the package, Director.
SARAH:
It must be somewhere else.
This is your home, too.
It doesn't have to be this way.
Mom, I've thought a lot about this, and, uh, and...
I can't stay.
Because for both of you to be safe, well, I can never see you again.
(sighs)
When the CIA recruited me, I was on the run with Dad, and we changed our identities so much that they never knew you existed.
And we can't let them find out about you now.
When you were a little girl, all I ever wanted for you was a normal life.
But you went off with your father, and he was never one... (sighs)
You just... you never got to go trick-or-treating or play on the soccer team, or never got to go to prom or homecoming.
I just wish I could have given you at least some of that.
Oh, um... don't forget this.
She likes to be wrapped up in a blanket.
It... helps her sleep.
And the sound of the rain-- she likes the sound of the rain.
And I've noticed that car rides...
It's okay, honey.
I'll take good care of her.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
Um, Mom?
Yes?
Going to prom and...
and soccer games and... (sighs) and... and all those normal things that you wanted for me--
...will you just make sure that she gets them?
Of course I will.
Thank you.
(sniffles)
So the baby has been with your mom this whole time?
Yeah.
Yeah, now I know that they're both safe.
Ryker has no idea where she is.
He has no idea that my mom ever existed.
I'm so sorry that I never told you any of this before.
I really am.
I just...
I didn't want to put anybody else in danger.
But thank you for trusting me.
Babe, I love you.
(slight electronic hum)
Who's that?
Yeah, what was that?
That's feedback.
(louder humming)
(mouthing)
Ryker.
Oh, my God, he knows that the baby is with my mom.
I've been looking forward to this little visit for a long time.
Let's go.
Your call has been forwarded to an automated...
She's not answering.
I sent her the coordinates.
I just hope she remembers the signal.
(cell phone ringing)
Mom?
Mom!
Please remember the signal, please.

Not yet, but I'll keep trying.
Stay there.

This is your sister Sarah.
Hi, Molly.
It's nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.
So who's this?
This is Rex.
Hi, Rex.
You know, I used to have a stuffed dog, too, when I was little, and I, I named him Bunny.
That's a funny name for a dog.
I know.
(both laugh)
CHUCK:
You know, I can't even begin to tell you how excited I am that I get to meet you.
It means a lot to me, too, more than you know.
Ah, it's been so long since I've seen her.
She was always a tough little thing, you know, but I worried about her.
Growing up mostly with her father, she always kept to herself;
she wouldn't let people get close.
I know I don't know you really well yet, but thank you for giving her this.
MORGAN:
Okay, that was-- that wasn't supposed to happen.
I'm going to pract...
I got to go practice.

Nice.
You were, uh, pretty good with Molly today.
Well... you know, I'm kind of a sweet guy when I'm not in douchey
Intersect brain-melting, life-ruining phase.
CAPTAIN:
Mission accomplished today, huh?
Yep.
Looks like Morgan finally found the right girl.
I know how he feels.
Aw.
Your favorite.
Honey, you didn't have to do that.
I wanted to.
I'm the lucky one now...
Joining the CIA and giving up everything you did, did you ever think it would lead you here?
No.
(laughs)
No, but, uh, Chuck's taught me that every now and then, it's okay to be surprised.
CHUCK:
You just love putting me in my place, don't you?
Yeah.
(laughing)
It's good to have you back, Agent Walker.
Sometimes when an agent goes through what you did, we lose 'em.
Well, you're not going to lose me, sir... but I am done with handlers.
Oh, I agree.
In fact, I think that it's time for you to become one.
I have a new assignment for you-- something stateside.
You think you can handle this one?
I like it here.
Me, too.
You know, I, I really want the life that you imagined for us,
Chuck, but if we go back to the CIA, it's just going to be missions and secrets that we have no control over.
What are you saying?
I gave my life to the CIA for a really long time and I chose it over my family and my friends, and that was the right thing for me to do at the time, but...
I'm different now.
You know, things have changed.
You've changed me.
I don't want to go back.
I want to turn down Beckman's offer.
(sighs)
Okay.
Okay.
We don't need that bonus and... we don't need this house because all we need is each other.
Sarah?
Wha-- hey, hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?
I am carving our names into the frame.
Honey, you know we don't own this home.
I know, but we will one day.
Might not be tomorrow or the next day, and it might take us months or years of hard work, but one day this will all be ours.
And when it is, I would like to always remember this moment.

I want you to know, if you ever feel like you need a place to come home to, well, you have one.
Who was that?
Nobody.
Are we a go?
Affirmative.
Ryker, I'm in.
How many?
I count 11.
Copy that.
On my word, take them out, all of them.
The men in that room just slaughtered the couple that lived in this house.
Give them the opportunity, they'll kill you, too.
Now move.
♪
Next?
Double doors, three o'clock.
The package is inside.
Ryker, th-the package...
The baby is the package.
Grab it and get out of there.
But what am, what am I supposed...?
Move, Walker.
I'm your handler and that's an order.
Oh, my God, he knows.
Hey, honey.
You ready for my big surprise?
Absolutely.
You know how much I love surprises.
Chuck, where are we?
Okay, here we go, up farther.
Straight, straight, straight, straight, and ta-dah!
Oh, my God, this is the house.
It's our house.
How, how did you do th...?
The real estate agent gave me the keys so we could try it out for the weekend.
Um, full disclosure--
I think she might have a little crush on me, so...
Chuck, this is, this is beautiful, but we still can't afford it.
Actually, we can.
I was talking to Beckman, and apparently her offer to rejoin the CIA comes with a signing bonus, which is enough for a down payment on the house and that dresser I've been eyeing at Anthropologie.
Uh, I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
Just visualize.
Think to yourself,
"What would my life be like in such an amazing home with the most dashing man I've ever met?"
Okay.
All right, all right, so after a hard day's work, we come home to the sweet, sweet sounds of Nina Simone emanating from our record player, which would fit perfectly-- I don't know--
say, in this corner right behind me.
Huh?
Open floor plan-- great for relaxing and watching your husband cook.
Cooking and talking, talking and cooking.
This area right here-- perfect for my game chairs.
Or not.
Maybe we'll talk about that, but this, this is perfect.
The door frame?
When Ellie and I were kids, our dad would measure us every year to see how tall we were getting.
I remember being so excited when I was finally taller than Ellie.
It took a while, but tenth grade was a good year for me.
What's the matter, what's the matter, what have I done?
Something-Something's missing, something's wrong?
Is it the game chairs?
'Cause those are negotiable.
No, Chuck, it's not that.
Um, look, I want this house and I want the life that you have envisioned for us.
I want every single part of it.
It's just that something urgent has come up.
What is it?
You know you can tell me anything.
Well, that's just it.
This time, Chuck, I can't tell you.
There are more men coming.
Get the package and get out of there.
It's going to be okay.

Sarah.
Sarah, please?
just, just tell me where you're going, tell me what happened.
I thought we decided no more secrets, no more doing things on our own.
Your words, not mine.
Look, I know, I know that.
It's just, I need you to trust me on this.
It's not that I don't trust you, this is not about trust.
What's so urgent, Bartowski?
Yeah, why'd you make Casey come all the way down here?
You know I'm gonna follow him everywhere he goes, and I was doing something really important.
Where you going, Walker?
It's nothing;
I'll be back soon.
J-Just wait, just wait one second.
Hear me out.
Yes, I love you, so, of course,
I'm going to want to know what's going on, why this mission needs to be so secretive, why you need so many guns, but I'm willing to put all that aside.
Really?
Really?
Really?
Sure, husbands ask a lot of questions.
You know who doesn't?
Carmichael Industries, and as CEO of Carmichael Industries,
I would like to offer you our services-- pro bono, of course.
Well, it wouldn't change anything.
There are still things I can't tell you.
You're the client, you're the boss.
Whatever this is, Walker, backup couldn't hurt.
Okay, here's what I can tell you.
The man that we're going after-- his name is Kieran Ryker-- ex-CIA, very dangerous.
Before we took down Shaw, he sent a communiqué to Ryker, and I'm gonna send one back posing as Shaw so that I can set up a meet.
Morgan, you're gonna stay in Castle in case anything goes wrong.
Chuck and Casey, pack your bags.
We're going to Budapest tonight.
All right, great, I'll bring a sweater.
Good.
You sure you can keep your mouth shut this time?
Of course.
Geez, Casey, you act like I haven't learned anything in the last four years.
Morgan, I need to know what's going on with Sarah, so I've done some research-- research on Hungarian culture cross-referenced with general horrible things that Sarah might want to keep a secret.
But didn't you tell Sarah that you wouldn't...?
Wikipedia-ing facts about Hungary is harmless.
I, for one, had no idea the Rubik's Cube was invented there.
Sure, I just think maybe you should give Sarah the benefit of the doubt.
I mean, any time the two of you have ever disagreed about anything, she's been right.
I can name four or five different times...
No, no, no, I-I know, I know, it's just,
I'm worried that we won't be prepared if something goes wrong, but if you're here in Castle, I guess we'll be okay.
Yeah.
Kind of a bummer about the timing, though.
I was supposed to have game night with Ellie and Awesome.
Alex said she was gonna come by, too, and...
I still don't know where her and I stand.
Wait, wait, why do you have to cancel?
You don't have to cancel game night.
Have game night in Castle.
Ellie and Awesome have wanted to check it out more anyway.
Ever since that last mission, they keep asking me tactical questions and using the term "ghost op"
as if they know what it means.
Plus, this way, if anything does go wrong, we'll be ready.
I'm on it.
Thank you.
Hey, listen, I know you can't talk to Bartowski about what's really going on.
That blabbermouth can't keep a secret to save his life.
But you can tell me, hmm?
I appreciate that, John, but the less you know the better.
Really.
Sure, no problem.
Walker.
Uh... look, before I hand over...
the package,
I need to know what's going to happen to her.
I'm afraid that's above your pay grade.
This mission wasn't sanctioned by the CIA, was it?
Look, we did a good thing.
The men you took out killed that girl's entire family.
She's the only heir to a massive fortune, so whoever has her has access to it.
She's the key.
And you want the money.
Listen, I know this job is the only thing in your life, but someday you're gonna realize it's not enough, that keeping your whole life a secret from everyone who loves you is too much.
But you don't have a family.
That money's just for you.
And what's going to happen to her when you take it?
She has a legitimate claim to that fortune, then she can come back at any time and take it from you.
And you expect me to believe that you're gonna let her live?
You're a rotten handler, Ryker.
Okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Shh.
Stay.
Stay.
So, uh, honey, this Ryker fellow-- is there anything about him you'd care to elaborate on?
Any personal details we should know about?
How he takes his coffee, for example?
No.
You know everything that you need to know.
Okay, I'm gonna be at that cafe waiting for him to arrive.
I need the two of you to stay up here away from Ryker, surveilling the street to see if anybody else is watching me.
Okay?
O-kay.
No.
Wait.
No.
You know what, Sarah?
Sarah, no, not okay.
Can't we just set aside the whole
CEO of Carmichael Industries thing just for a second?
No, Chuck, that wasn't part of the deal.
Yeah, except that I'm your husband who would do anything in the world for you, and I'm worried.
Okay, look, this isn't about me.
There are lives in danger because of something that...
Look, if I tell you, I'm not only compromising their safety, but your safety, as well.
Okay, so, when you see Ryker, what then?
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna kill him, Chuck.
Still nothing.
Look, I know I typically overreact to stuff like this, but there's something about this entire situation that I do not like.
This time, you might be right, Bartowski.
Did some digging.
Turns out, Ryker's whole file has been redacted.
Which means whatever happened between him and Sarah ended pretty damn badly.
Sarah, what's going on?
Um, it's nothing.
I need you two to follow the waiter.
I think he might be working with Ryker.
Don't move.
We'll be right down.
Where...
Where is Sarah?
Got him.
Sarah, wait, wait!
Wait.
Where are you going?
!
Ryker figured out it was me.
I'm sorry.
I've got to go do this alone.
The waiter!
Come on, come on!
Still no word from Chuck.
Everything must be going well on the mish.
Your turn, bro.
Oh, right.
Okay.
You know what?
I feel so lucky to have a lady to share my little plastic car with, and, uh, not afraid to put a couple of kids in the backseat.
Not now, obviously.
That'd be crazy.
But you know, someday.
You know, commitment is not something that I fear.
Well, I'm keeping my options open.
Yeah, I noticed.
There you are in your little pink car by yourself.
Must be so lonely.
What is going on with these two?
I thought they worked everything out.
Me, too.
Maybe they need some alone time.
Great.
Because if I have to spin for a new mortgage rate again, I'm going to die.
It's like we're actively wasting our baby-sitter.
Okay, let's, uh...
let's speed things along here.
Then you and I can have
- a little look-see in Castle.
- Ellie?
Hmm?
Uh, your turn.
Yeah, my turn.
Hey, spin a ten, game is over.
All right.
Spin a ten.
Okay.
Oh!
Millionaire Estates!
Yay!
Yeah, baby!
We won in Life.
We did.
Yeah.
Okay.
We'll take a little breather before the next game, guys.
Bye.
Yeah, good, good.
Good kids.
Oh!
Our hands touched for a second, and I kind of got, like, a chill on my back.
It's kind of funny, 'cause...
Morgan?
Mm?
What am I really doing here?
I'm-I'm not here to try anything, if that's what you're asking.
Unless what you're asking is that you want me to...
- No.
That's what I'm saying-- no, of course.
Uh...
There's no quick fix for us.
It's just going to take some time.
I know that.
Hey, I totally get it.
How about a game of Sorry?
Sorry!
Sorry!
Sorry!
Come back.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Ahh!
Whoa!
Yeah!
Once again, look who doesn't need the Intersect.
Where's Ryker?
Where the hell is he?
Do you speak Hungarian?
No.
Do you, Mr. "I don't need the Intersect?"
I think I got a phrase book on me somewhere.
Uh...
What are you doing?
I got her in the deli.
What?
She wasn't busy.
It's Europe.
Would you mind asking this gentleman what his business is with Ryker?
He said this man you are asking about gave me 20,000 forint to put a note under a coffee cup.
He doesn't know anything else.
He's lying.
I think you understand every word I'm saying.
You're gonna tell me where Ryker is, or you're gonna lose a lung.
Where the hell is Ryker?
!
Any sign of her?
Nothing yet, sir.
You didn't think
I was just gonna use the front door, did you?
I knew you wouldn't use the front door.
You tell me everything Sean told you right now.
What is that?
Oh, God, I don't know what you want.
What do you want?
What do you need?
Oh, my God.
Okay.
Okay.
Um...
Hello?
Uh, hi, Mom.
It's me.
Honey?
Are you okay?
Where are you?
I'm just...
I'm uh...
I'm in a bit of a situation here.
Are you hurt?
Uh, no, no, no, no, it's nothing like that.
I was on a mission, and, um...
Well, I'm looking after a baby, and she won't stop crying, and I'm not really sure what to do.
Can you please help me?
Okay.
Uh, yeah.
Um, is she wet?
Uh, no.
No, it's not that, and I... and I fed her an hour ago.
Did you try rocking her?
What?
No.
Okay, honey, I want you to bring her close to you.
She needs to feel safe.
She needs to feel your warmth.
Okay.
Okay, she's close.
Now what?
Okay, now just-just rock her.
Slowly back and forth and...
Mom, this is not working.
I'm not good at this.
What am I supposed to do?
Don't freak out, honey.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Just, um...
Just try singing to her.
Um... what am I supposed to sing?
Do you remember the lullaby
I used to sing to you when you were little?
Yeah.
Uh, I-I think so.

Did it work?
Yeah.
Yeah, it worked, Mom.
Thank you.
Tie her up.
I have to give you credit on that fake communiqué.
Unfortunately for you, I already knew that Shaw was back in prison.
So tell me, did you just come all this way to have a cup of coffee with your old handler?
You're asking the wrong question.
Just get to the point, Ryker.
The point is that it's not about money anymore.
You know why
I requested to be your handler?
Why I brought you to Budapest in the first place?
Because your file screamed loner.
You had no family to speak of, never trusted anyone.
I knew that you could keep a secret because you had no one to tell.
And you still don't, do you?
I bet no one even knows that you're here.
Do they?
And that's why you're gonna die today... unless you tell me something.
Where is she?
Shaw told me she's still alive.
Where's the little girl?
What?
You don't know where she is, and you're never gonna find out.
That's why I came here.
That's all I needed to know.
Sir, there's a problem in the foyer.
I'm not done with you.
Stay with her!
You two, come with me.
What the hell?
They made me talk!
What are you looking at?
Sarah?
Sarah, baby, are you okay?
Move.
He was just a distraction.
Let's go.
Tell me where the nukes are, Doctor.
Or should I call you...
Damian?
You may know my real name, but that doesn't mean that I'll give you my intel, Cobress.
Well, I have ways of making you talk.
Oh, okay.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Okay, okay.
Is this... is this part of the bit, babe?
No, I'm stuck.
It's my earring.
I'm stuck...
Ow.
Okay, hold on, hold on.
All right.
Oh!
Ah!
You all right?
Yes.
What was that accent?
Oy.
My British accent.
- Really?
- Morgan, stop.
I thought I could do this, but I can't.
If you don't...
if you don't want to play a game, that's okay.
You know what we could do?
We could watch a movie.
We could watcha bunch of movies...
You broke up with with me in a text.
I don't know how to trust you again.
I think I should probably just go.
Babe.
Babe.
Maybe alone time isn't what they needed.
We have to do something.
Yeah.
Hey, there.
Hey.
I'm actually heading home.
No, really.
I'm...
Alex, okay...
Devon, really, I...
Listen, I think you're making a mistake.
Hey, you got a sec?
What's that?
What?
That...
Oh.
Uh, nothing.
Just...
Um, I actually wanted to talk to you about Alex.
I don't think you're gonna understand what I'm going through here.
I don't know if you know this, but when Devon and I first started dating, we took a break for a while.
What happened?
As you probably know, I was an A F model.
I got to admit, I let it go to my head.
He was a real ass.
For our first anniversary, he gave me a signed photograph of himself.
He was carrying a canoe in, in nothing but suit pants.
And so I just, I broke up with him.
I had to win her back.
You know, I couldn't lose a woman like that.
So I pulled out all the stops.
I made a Tracy Chapman mix tape;
I got front-row tickets to Les Mis.
I even baked those little cupcakes, you know, the kind with the peanut butter inside.
Oh, yeah, I like those.
Yeah, so does she.
Did it work?
Uh, no.
So then what did you do?
I mean, why did you take him back?
I don't think he knows this, but I came home from work one day, and he was sitting on my doorstep with a bunch of calla lilies, and he must have been there for hours, because he was on the phone with his mom,
and he was so sweet with her.
He really cared about what she was saying.
I just remembered that that was the man I fell in love with.
Calla lilies-- works every time.
Devon, I really appreciate this, but I've got to...
No, Alex, come on.
Yeah, we all make mistakes, and Morgan made some big ones.
Yeah.
Trust me, he loves you.
She's in pain, Morgan, but if she's the one that you love, just... you just have to be yourself.
Stop trying to force it.
You are a catch, okay?
She's going to realize that soon enough.
Hey.
You're up.
Feeling better?
Yeah.
You were kind of in and out a little, so I took the liberty of putting your dresses away.
I wasn't sure if they went on the left or the right, so I went with the right.
Uh, Sarah, look...
You-you know that I'm,
I'm not the kind of guy who says things like this, but... whatever it is that you thought you needed to hide... not telling me the truth, going out on you own like that,
I think it was, uh... a mistake.
I think that you were wrong.
You're right.
When Ryker captured me in Budapest, I kept thinking why am I doing it this way?
Why do I feel like I have to do everything on my own?
But it's what my dad taught me.
It's the way the CIA taught me, that you can only ever trust yourself.
But the truth is that I trust you completely, and I want to tell you everything.
Hello?
How are you holding up?
Look, I know what Ryker made you do.
I know everything.
I was just obeying orders.
There's no need to worry about that now.
Where's the package?
If I have the package in my possession, then what?
The CIA would take it into custody, and then...
Do you guarantee its protection?
You know I can't make guarantees.
The CIA keeps records on these kind of things.
Records that a man like Ryker might be able to get his hands on.
And who knows what he would do.
He's a wild card.
Agent Walker?
Sarah?
I'm not in possession of the package, Director.
It must be somewhere else.
This is your home, too.
It doesn't have to be this way.
Mom, I've thought a lot about this, and, uh, and...
I can't stay.
Because for both of you to be safe, well, I can never see you again.
When the CIA recruited me, I was on the run with Dad, and we changed our identities so much that they never knew you existed.
And we can't let them find out about you now.
When you were a little girl, all I ever wanted for you was a normal life.
But you went off with your father, and he was never one...
You just... you never got to go trick-or-treating or play on the soccer team, or never got to go to prom or homecoming.
I just wish I could have given you at least some of that.
Oh, um... don't forget this.
She likes to be wrapped up in a blanket.
It... helps her sleep.
And the sound of the rain-- she likes the sound of the rain.
And I've noticed that car rides...
It's okay, honey.
I'll take good care of her.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
Um, Mom?
Yes?
Going to prom and...
and soccer games and... and... and all those normal things that you wanted for me--
...will you just make sure that she gets them?
Of course I will.
Thank you.
So the baby has been with your mom this whole time?
Yeah.
Yeah, now I know that they're both safe.
Ryker has no idea where she is.
He has no idea that my mom ever existed.
I'm so sorry that I never told you any of this before.
I really am.
I just...
I didn't want to put anybody else in danger.
But thank you for trusting me.
Babe, I love you.
Who's that?
Yeah, what was that?
That's feedback.
Ryker.
Oh, my God, he knows that the baby is with my mom.
I've been looking forward to this little visit for a long time.
Let's go.
Your call has been forwarded to an automated...
She's not answering.
I sent her the coordinates.
I just hope she remembers the signal.
Mom?
Mom!
Please remember the signal, please.
Did you get ahold of Morgan?
Not yet, but I'll keep trying.
Stay there.
I've got her.
Nice apron.
Thanks.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, guys, sorry, but this street is permit parking only.

You came so close to keeping her safe, you really did, but I'm gonna kill you and then I'm gonna kill your mom.
And then after I get that money, you know what I'm gonna do with that little girl?
Hmm?

You just don't quit, do you?
But you always manage to make the same mistake.
Even when you have a team, here you are all alone.
When the hell are you gonna learn?
I'm not alone.
She'll never have nightmares and she'll never even know that you existed.
She's going to have the life that she deserves, a normal one.
Sarah, thank God you're okay.

It means a lot to me, too, more than you know.
Ah, it's been so long since I've seen her.
She was always a tough little thing, you know, but I worried about her.
Growing up mostly with her father, she always kept to herself;
she wouldn't let people get close.

Joining the CIA and giving up everything you did, did you ever think it would lead you here?
No.
No, but, uh, Chuck's taught me that every now and then, it's okay to be surprised.
You just love putting me in my place, don't you?
Yeah.
It's good to have you back, Agent Walker.
Sometimes when an agent goes through what you did, we lose 'em.
Well, you're not going to lose me, sir... but I am done with handlers.
Oh, I agree.
In fact, I think that it's time for you to become one.
I have a new assignment for you-- something stateside.
You think you can handle this one?
I like it here.
Me, too.
You know, I, I really want the life that you imagined for us,
Chuck, but if we go back to the CIA, it's just going to be missions and secrets that we have no control over.
What are you saying?
I gave my life to the CIA for a really long time and I chose it over my family and my friends, and that was the right thing for me to do at the time, but...
I'm different now.
You know, things have changed.
You've changed me.
I don't want to go back.
I want to turn down Beckman's offer.
Okay.
Okay.
We don't need that bonus and... we don't need this house because all we need is each other.
Sarah?
Wha-- hey, hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?
I am carving our names into the frame.
Honey, you know we don't own this home.
I know, but we will one day.
Might not be tomorrow or the next day, and it might take us months or years of hard work, but one day this will all be ours.

Okay, you showed them your bank accounts.
There's no proof that you got paid.
I mean, lots of people had access to the murder book where you put the photos.
So there's no proof that you leaked them.
I mean...
It's gonna be okay.
Yeah.
Maybe you're right.
Petey, come on, breakfast!
Tommy, no banging.
I can't find my shoes.
Uh, that's because it's in the fireplace.
We -- we were just horsing around.
God, it doesn't stop.
I guess these two are gonna fix the fence and maybe the sprinklers.
Everybody wants to help out.
You promised me to my face at the last community meeting that you'd get that thing hauled away.
But still one month later, my kids got to watch guys pissing in the alley and strawberries turning tricks.
The city told me that they were gonna take care of that.
More cops.
Just like clockwork.
You gonna pass the buck, too?
'Cause he just keeps on telling me, and somehow, that thing's still here.
I like this lady, but she's starting to get on my nerves.
Still, sucks that her kids got to see this.
You know what sucks is we get the gun, the big stick, and they think we have all the power.
Then when they realize we don't, they get all mouthy with us.
That's what sucks.
- Hey, how you doing?
- Good.
What's up?
Good.
Yeah.
Hang on a second.
You guys raided this house and this trailer about two months ago, right?
Yeah. 40k of rock, all in a day's work.
Excuse me.
This -- this house, it's slated for demo, isn't it?
Yeah, that's the word.
- That's the word.
- So what's up with the trailer?
You guys having trouble getting that cleared?
It's not our call, man.
We're still waiting on paperwork.
Till then, it's private property.
Oh, private property.
So you guys got yourselves a warrant, then, right?
You mind if I take a look at that?
See, here's my problem, fellas.
You got yourself a little felony bus stop here.
Anytime you need a felony bust, you just drive on by.
Well, like you, we don't make the laws, remember?
Excuse us.
We're done, huh?
What the hell, Sal?
A double murder on Vermont, and you give it to Faloona and Mills?
- I'm next in the rotation.
- I took you out.
Why?
Because some B.S.S. asshole doesn't want me riding alone?
Sammy -- you're listening to these people?
The shrink I talked to for 10 minutes, he doesn't know shit about being a cop.
Sit down.
He probably hasn't been south of the 10.
Look, Sammy.
Some git cops came in last night and brought in a suspect in Nate's murder.
Shit.
S-so, did they raid the guy's place?
They did but came up with nothing.
Nothing?
No blood?
Nothing on his clothes?
Lab's still checking, all right, but it doesn't look good.
Look, all they really got is a snitch who'll swear the guy did it, and he's a base-head.
Not much of a witness, you know?
Well, when can I I.D. him?
They're putting together a six-pack, so it's just gonna take an extra beat.
Sammy, we got to make this thing squeaky clean.
You understand?
Hey, the varsity team.
- Hey.
- Hey.
All right, so far we got 10 shell casings --
.22s and .38s.
And this guy was the target?
No, doesn't look to be.
I got a witness over there who says that these two assholes went after each other.
Bang, bang, bang.
They get away.
And this poor guy gets caught in the crossfire.
Wedding band, no tats.
I hate these.
You get a statement from him?
Yeah, started to, but then you guys came.
His name's Henry Watts.
You want to talk?
Yeah.
You take the body?
Yeah, sure.
Hey, Mr. Watts, how you doing?
I'm Detective Adams.
Hi.
Good to meet you.
You sure you're okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
It's just when the shooting started,
I dove between two cars.
Guess I just...
banged my head.
You should let the paramedics check you out.
You could have a concussion.
I'd be surprised if that were true.
I'm told I'm very hardheaded.
So, what exactly happened?
Uh, well, I came out of there with some groceries, saw two guys arguing.
Next thing I know, they're pulling out guns.
I mean, it was nuts.
They started shooting at each other from like 10 feet apart.
That poor guy there was just trying to get out of the way.
You think you could I.D. the guys?
I certainly could try.
Uh, hey, guys, can you come over here for a sec?
Um, let them check you out, okay?
Yeah.
Okay, okay.
Maybe they should.
Hey, Adams.
We think you're a lot hotter in person, if you don't mind us saying.
Munoz, come on, isn't there something else you could be doing, like traffic control maybe?
Oh!
Lydia, we don't think you did it.
Let's go.
Hey.
What's going on?
This man doesn't have a concussion.
He has a bullet in his head.
No, Ma'am...wh...
When I spoke to you guys last month you told me that the house and the trailer were both gonna be cleared -- ma'am --
Okay.
Well, you got my number.
Thanks.
And we wonder why people go postal.
Great.
Now this.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
All right!
Stop it right now!
Stop it!
What are you doing in front of these kids, huh?
What are we teaching them?
Share and share alike.
They don't got that in Armenia?
- I'm Turkish.
- I'm from Jordan.
That's fine!
You work it out.
Just switch off days or something.
You guys can do that, right?
Fine.
I'll take the weekends.
You stupid terrorist!
Terrorist?
!
Yeah.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
All right, all right, all right, all right.
Hook him up.
Hook him up.
He's selling guns to kids.
Look.
And I'm the terrorist?
You know what?
I need sugar.
You?
Hey, everybody!
It's your lucky day!
Free ice cream, courtesy of the Los Angeles Police Department.
There you go, buddy.
Have a bomb pop.
And furthermore, the investigating officers are deliberately not present, nor have their identities been made known to Detective Bryant.
Taking every precaution, this six-pack I.D.
Will be handled by Detective Olati Johnson of the domestic violence table.
She has no knowledge of the case.
Olati?
The photos you're about to see may or may not contain the person responsible for Nate Moretta's murder.
If you understand this and the rest of the admonitions, please sign here.
Do you see anyone you recognize?
Take your time, Sammy.
Excuse me.
You all right?
I saw his face, Sal.
I just...
I just needed some air.
All right.
That's cool.
Just take a little breather, then.
We'll go back in, all right?
Tomorrow.
I need a day.
Sammy, you're not sure, are you?
I just said I saw him.
I just...
It's just harder than I expected.
Sammy, this guy has an attorney breathing down my neck.
Without an I.D., we might have to kick him.
Can't we just stall?
We do it all the time for shit that doesn't even matter.
Come on, Sal.
What's the big deal?
All right.
I'll do what I can, all right?
I need you to focus.
We need this, Sammy, all right?
Yeah.
We went lights and sirens for this?
Dude, are you kidding me, man?
I had to get you here before the coroner moved the body.
Check this out.
You know how they always say TV kills brain cells?
Voilà.
You got to be shitting me.
What the hell happened?
Let me clue you in, Sherlock.
Pussy Galore over there said that he liked to do it while watching porn.
He also liked the bottom.
So he mounted the TV up there, pulled it out over the top of them, but I guess he wasn't too handy, because he used the wrong screws.
Where was she when this happened?
She said it missed her head by an inch.
I always say, blow jobs can save lives.
Hey.
How you doing?
For a guy with a .22 slug in his head?
I guess the answer's...good.
They said if you're feeling up to it that we can ask you a couple questions.
That'll distract me.
Please, shoot.
I mean...
You're an artist?
Uh, computer graphics mostly.
Got to eat.
But every now and then, I go old school.
Nothing like a pencil and pad.
This what you want to know?
Wow.
That's amazing.
So the guys were black?
Light-skinned, yeah.
One of them had a tattoo.
I couldn't see it clearly.
And they were dressed like this?
Wife-beaters and bling?
Yeah.
One of them wore an Angels cap.
This is amazing.
Did either of them have a car?
Not that I saw.
Hey.
Hi.
Um, doc wants to see us a sec.
Okay.
I think we're about to get the "leave him alone and let him rest" speech.
Ah, before neurosurgery?
Probably smart.
Is there anyone I can call for you?
Oh, my fiancée's in Rome for work.
I called her.
She'll be on her way back soon.
Good.
I'll be back in a bit.
I'd get what you need from him as soon as possible.
Yeah, I was kind of trying to do that.
He doesn't have long, okay?
I'm just giving you the heads-up.
What?
The bullet entered the skull and settled posterior of the optic chiasm.
He's got increasing intracranial pressure.
In English.
The thing is small and really deep in his brain.
Any operation to remove it will most likely kill him.
But he's -- he's -- he's talking.
He seems fine.
That's not gonna last.
Well, are you gonna tell him?
Not yet.
We're waiting on Keith Black, the top guy at Cedars, to take a look at his scans.
Maybe he'll have a different take, but I doubt it.
Sorry.
I got to go.
Um, Fernandez wants us back now.
Of course she does.
It's not just you, okay?
You, those R.H.D. guys, and the six patrol officers that were first on the scene are now suspended from duty.
You've been assigned home pending an internal investigation.
Are we getting paid?
Are we getting paid?
Yeah, with all benefits.
That's good with me, 'cause I didn't nada.
I'm just gonna get caught up on my Internet shopping.
Am I supposed to just sit home and do nothing?
"Assigned home" means that during working hours, you are to stay at home.
Well, are you gonna put an ankle bracelet on me?
'Cause if not, I'm gonna do as I please.
You have my cellphone number.
You can reach me.
Oh, no.
You took my cellphone.
I'm gonna have to note that on the file.
Oh, I'm really worried now.
What's up?
Pulled a traffic warrant on him.
It's bullshit, but it'll hold him till tomorrow.
His attorney saw the video of your six-pack I.D.
Now he's demanding that I do a lineup with his client in it.
Good.
Better than looking at mug shots, you know?
The asshole's standing right in front of me.
Yeah.
Get a good night's sleep, all right?
The lineup's tomorrow, 0900.
So...
The doctor read you the riot act?
Yes, but I charmed her.
Oh.
The nurses brought me some art supplies up from the kids' ward.
Figure as long as I can draw, right, how bad can it be?
Definitely, yeah.
Everybody seems really optimistic.
They got this famous neurosurgeon coming in to review my CAT scan.
Then they're gonna settle on what to do.
The surgery's tricky, obviously.
They just want to do their homework.
Look, Mr. Watts --
Henry.
Henry.
About the case --
Oh, yeah, I remembered -- the guy in the hat yelled the other guy's name.
Leon, Dion, something like that.
No, I needed to tell you I'm no longer on the case.
There will be two new detectives, and they'll be coming around soon.
Oh.
I see.
You're that Detective Adams.
Lydia, I guess.
Yes.
My fame precedes me.
I saw it on TV.
On an endless loop.
So, did you leak the photos?
No.
I believe you.
Thanks.
I appreciate it.
So, I guess you're gonna be going, now that you're off the case?
I'm gonna stay a bit and brief the detectives when they get here.
Might as well.
Avoid the paparazzi?
Hmm.
That too.
Yeah.
And listen, um...
In case I go into surgery before Jessie, my fiancée, gets here, could you, um...
Could you let her know our dogs are with the neighbors?
Or could you get the detectives to tell her?
Sure, sure, sure.
I will make sure she gets the message.
I'm feeling...
kind of tired.
Gonna try and catch a nap.
Okay.
I'll check in in a bit.
Yeah.
I've called three times today.
I've spoken to five different clerks.
Sure as shit, the windows are blacked out.
I know you keep saying that, but I need to know when.
Banging around on the inside.
So finally I get the door pried open, and -- bwah!
-- this frickin' vulture comes flying out with an ear hanging in its beak.
I look inside, and the guy just blew his head off with a 12 gauge.
How'd the bird get in there?
It got in through the hole in the roof that the gun made, man.
It scared the shit out of me.
Shit.
Shit, beats the hell out of mine.
Just some poor old guy, ass up in the air, next to the toilet.
Blah, blah, blah.
That's a dime a dozen, man.
The extra pressure caused a heart attack.
I heard it a million times.
Speaking of shotguns, you heard this one?
So, Koreatown, one of those rooms you rent by the hour.
- How much you pay for that?
- Hey, relax.
We find this dead guy, right?
He's completely naked, chest blown out, lying on a bed, shards of mirror sticking out of his stomach, his neck, his face.
I got this.
I got this.
He's laying on the bed next to his shotty, right?
He killed himself with his legs up in the air.
He's got a pencil through his toes crossed through the trigger guard.
He pulls the trigger with his feet.
The recoil of the gun kicks it up into the ceiling, smashing the mirror.
Am I close?
Huh?
I heard that one, man.
You're gonna have to try a little bit harder, hello?
But I'll still buy your dirty ass lunch.
What?
Shit.
She just hung up on me.
Why do you even care, man?
I find it novel, Dewey, every once in a while to give a shit.
You know, when you called me and said you were at the hospital,
I thought you'd gone 51/50 on me.
Trust me, I am this close.
Nozick and Chavez?
Left them three voicemails, and neither one of them will call me back.
Yeah, they're working a stabbing in Lynwood, probably got their hands full.
Yeah, but this is priority.
The witness may not last.
It's not your case now.
Why are you making it harder for yourself?
'Cause it's not just about me, and I don't want to see them screw this up.
Fernandez told the cap that you weren't gonna go home.
And I thought her head was gonna explode, you know?
So she sent you here to convince me?
Well, her language was a bit stronger.
Yeah, well, snap a picture and leak her a photo of this.
Thought you might feel that way.
I cannot believe this is happening, Russ.
All my hard work, my rep.
It's all going to crap now.
Leak cases are hard to prove.
Once the dog-and-pony show's over, everything will settle down.
So you just got to wait it out.
If you're wrong, will you at least be my lead rep?
Go through all of this with me?
Don't they assign guys to do that from the league?
Yeah, but I don't trust anybody else.
No, I-I don't have any experience.
Yeah, but you've got my back.
Of course.
Okay.
It's late.
Yeah, just about done here.
You been coming around a lot.
You know, doing what I can.
Just trying to help her out, you know?
That all you want to do, help her?
What'd you say?
You heard what I said.
You accuse me of trying to move in on the widow?
You're the one living in her house, asshole.
You don't know shit about what's going on, so I suggest you keep your mouth shut.
I know you sleep here now, don't you?
Doesn't take a genius to figure out what that means.
Nate was my partner.
I'm looking after his family the way he would've wanted.
Yeah?
You got that?
Yeah.
Is that clear to you?
Yeah.
Get the Out of here.
You know what?
You need to get some help.
Do I?
Yeah.
See ya.
Yeah.
Shit.
It's called trephination, or burr holes, to relieve the pressure.
Okay, but if you're gonna drill in my head, why not just dig the bullet out?
You're still bleeding, Mr. Watts.
This has to happen now.
Then we can pursue our options.
- Like what?
- Dr. Bernheimer will be talking to you.
No.
Why can't you tell me?
And what about the guy at Cedars?
We're all still reviewing things.
Please lie back.
All asleep.
Pretty amazing, actually.
You're good with kids, Sammy.
I don't know about that.
I think they just sense that I'm one of them.
You went at Stiles pretty good back there.
Oh.
I thought you were gonna deck him.
That -
- I'm sorry.
I'm an idiot.
No.
I'm sure you're just stressed about the lineup tomorrow.
Everyone's talking about it, how it's all up to you.
Well, if I recognize him --
I mean, if it's the guy, I'll recognize him.
And...
If I do, we'll take him down.
I promise.
What are we doing, Sammy?
Hey, buddy.
I'm thirsty.
Okay, baby, I'll get you water.
So, you're gonna be my dad now?
Okay.
Come on.
Let's go inside.
Hey.
If you want me to come back, I can.
Come in.
Come in.
They, um -- they tell you about...
I got...
Two new holes...
In my head.
Ease the pressure, I guess.
Beyond that, I don't know.
Seems like no one wants to operate.
Or no one knows how.
You heard about Jessica?
Uh, no, just, um, she's on her way.
Yeah, I know.
You know what she does for a living?
Writes children's books.
Really good ones about a lizard named Fig.
- You have any kids?
- No.
Then you probably never heard of a lizard named Fig.
It's really good.
It's how we met.
I did the illustrations for her second book.
And we just...
Fell in love.
Just jumped right into it.
Still can't believe how lucky I got.
What would you do...
If you were me?
Would you go under the knife for the 1% chance at living, or would you try to hold out for a chance to say goodbye?
Oh, I don't --
I --
I was in love once.
Yeah?
Yeah, it was my second training officer when I just joined the force, and...
He was married with kids, and when he decided to leave his wife...
Things got ugly real fast.
What happened?
We figured it out.
We figured out a way to be together.
And then he was killed on the job.
A shootout at an auto-parts store.
It was senseless, but...
But I had been reassigned.
So I wasn't there to say goodbye.
And that...
If you love her...
Hold out.
That'd be my answer.
I'm gonna let you get some rest, okay?
Don't -- don't.
Please.
This was set for 9:00.
It's now going on 11:00.
I don't work here, sir.
You're gonna have to take that up with the sheriff's department.
And don't think I don't know the irregularities with my client's traffic warrant were a direct result of your stalling.
I'm just a cop, counselor.
Fewer words would be good.
Now, if you could just stand the over there, please?
Thank you.
So, we good to go?
Sammy?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Detective Bryant, do you recognize any of the individuals standing before you?
Right before he hit Nate, he said, "toma puto."
Could I have number 2, 3 repeat that for me?
Number 2, take one step forward and say, "toma puto."
Toma puto.
Step back.
Okay, now number 3.
Toma puto.
S-- can 6 take his hand out of his pocket?
Number 6, take your hand out of your pocket.
3.
Number 3.
You're saying you recognize number 3?
It's number 3.
Okay, we're done.
Number 2.
Number 2.
I meant number 2.
It's number 2.
Okay?
Let's go.
Number 2 is an inmate here, Sammy.
He got extra food for standing in the lineup.
That's -- that's just great.
Terrific.
Thank you.
No.
Yeah.
Okay, you too.
Well, good news.
Some desk jockey just forgot to sign a form.
So they moved the crack trailer this morning.
All right.
So now we're going to double-check.
You trust anything the city tells you?
No.
Geez, that sucks.
Okay, bye.
Nate Moretta -- that cop who got murdered?
Yeah.
His partner picked the wrong guy in a lineup.
Ouch!
Notify the suicide hotline.
Dewey.
I'm just saying, man.
You know how it is.
They're gonna be watching his ass.
All units and A35, 211 in progress, 1620 Fuega.
Light them up.
Freeze!
Drop the knife!
Drop it!
Follow me in the car!
Stop!
Stop right now!
That's it.
Thank you.
I'm gonna borrow this.
Hey, jag-off.
Not rampart?
You're learning.
Give me a hand.
Muchachos...
Venga ayudarnos, por favor.
Stop!
He's getting in a car.
Right behind you, partner.
Gold Ford.
License plate -
- Victor-4-7.
Go!
Gracias, amigo.
Gracias.
Yeah.
Yeah, this is John Cooper with the Los Angeles Police Department.
Yeah, how you doing?
I got an abandoned vehicle blocking the alley behind 226 Vernon.
Yeah.
All right, I appreciate it.
A35, we're in pursuit of a gold Ford Contour, now westbound on Florence at Brighton.
A43, show us en route to back.
Suspect just turned, westbound on Selma from Cahuenga.
Man #2:
Air-3, what's the speed of the suspect's vehicle, and what are the conditions?
No, no, no, do not call off this chase!
Clear!
70, 75.
Traffic's moderate, non-residential.
A43, show us as a secondary unit in pursuit.
Approaching a no-fly zone.
Got to back off.
Primary unit, you have it.
We got this
Clear.
We're clear.
A35, suspect heading northbound now -
- Schrader.
We got this son of a bitch.
Clear!
Dewey!
Damn!
God damn.
Damn it.
We got to keep going.
Jesus.
Woman down.
She just came out of nowhere!
Shit!
Hey!
Freeze!
Let me see your hands now!
Get your hands up!
Get your hands out of the car!
Put your hands up!
Let's go!
Hands up now!
A43, show us code 6, corner of Yucca and Argyle.
Does she have a pulse?
Oh, God.
Oh, God!
God damn it!
One, two...
You got him?
Yeah, I got him, I got him, I got him.
All right, we got two pinned.
You okay, ma'am?
Somebody's coming, ma'am.
No, I can't move my legs!
Okay.
It's okay.
19, 20... 21, 22, 23, 24.
Come on, come on.
It's over.
It's over, man.
It's over.
She's dead.
Eggs.
Can I get you something?
I forgot them at the store.
How could you forget that?
Weren't they on your list?
Yeah.
Yeah, but...
Henry.
Jessica.
God, baby.
How do you feel?
Jess.
When are you having surgery?
What's -- uh...
Oh, I told them I was gonna wait for you to get here.
So...
Dewey told me already, John.
All part of God's plan.
Don't make me tell you to off, too.
Look, what happened was tragic, all right?
But we did what we were supposed to.
We lost air support.
We were primary.
It was my responsibility.
I could have called it off.
She stepped right in front of you.
There were sirens, lights flashing.
You know the funniest part?
I wasn't gonna be a cop.
I was just gonna surf.
I don't know.
Bartend.
But then getting pregnant, my marriage blowing up.
I had a kid.
I needed a job.
That was all this was supposed to be.
How many surfers run toward gunfire?
Hmm?
How many?
Teachers, bartenders -- they just jump in their car and go after these assholes?
No.
No, and until they do, you cut yourself a break.
I-I got to go pick up Tristan.
If not you, who?
Who, Chickie?
Who deserves to be wearing that uniform?
Um, Detective?
She was right there with him when he died.
I knew you'd want to know.
Thanks.
And, Detective...
I couldn't help hearing what you said to him.
It was...
It was beautiful.
I'm just sorry that you had to go through that.
I just made that up, actually.
Just wanted to give him strength, you know?
Really?
It felt so honest and heartfelt and...
Cops -- good storytellers.
We agreed that you would not come here.
I got no place to go.
Well, you can't stay here.
Jesus!
Wh--
What is it?
I up.
Everything I touch...
Everything just turns to shit.
Everything.
W-- what -- what did you do?
It's what I didn't -- it's what I couldn't --
it's what I couldn't do.
Hey, hey.
I couldn't.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Sammy.
Sammy.
Come on.
Sammy.
- Hey.
- Hey.
How you doing?
You came to check on me.
Come on.
I need a drink.
You all right?
Have you, um...
Heard the news at all lately?
Do you that they kicked that guy in the Moretta case?
Yeah, man.
I guess when it rains, it pours.
You heard a patrol cop killed a pedestrian in the 77th?
High-speed chase.
She just walked into traffic.
Yeah, I heard that.
And now I'm about to lose my job for leaking photos of a dead celebrity.
All these years of being a good cop, and that's my Google hit.
Lydia.
No, it's gonna happen, Russ.
I can feel it.
Just all the rage I feel, you know?
Just I'm up all night.
Who could do this?
Not just to me, but to us.
I did.
Come on, Russ.
It's not funny.
I, uh, gave them a couple photos, and they paid me half a million bucks.
What, was I gonna be a secretary the rest of my life?
Scrape by on disability, if they even gave it to me?
It, Lyd.
I saw my chance, so I took it.
If I had known that the photos were from your phone,
I wouldn't have done it.
I just told Fernandez an hour ago, got my ass reamed by the chief.
Took them all of a minute to fire me.
At least it hurts a lot less with cash in the bank.
You did it for the money?
No.
No.
No!
I wouldn't -- it looked like that asshole actor chopped his girlfriend's head off.
I mean, especially celebrities -- they have those lawyers and those fancy handlers, and...
You know, the public has to know when vicious shit like that goes down.
He was innocent.
He shot himself.
I know.
I couldn't have predicted that.
But the bottom line is...
I'm sorry.
I know you went through a lot for that and it messed you up.
And I wish --
I should've told you sooner.
That was wrong.
I don't even know you.
Lydia.
I don't even know you, dude.
Lydia, please.
Come on.
Lydia!
♪ Southland 3x07 ♪ Sideways Original Air Date on February 15, 2011
Suspect just turned, westbound on Selma from Cahuenga.
Man #2:
Air-3, what's the speed of the suspect's vehicle, and what are the conditions?
No, no, no, do not call off this chase!
Clear!
70, 75.
Traffic's moderate, non-residential.
A43, show us as a secondary unit in pursuit.
Approaching a no-fly zone.
Got to back off.
- Primary unit, you have it.
- We got this
Clear.
We're clear.
A35, suspect heading northbound now -
- Schrader.
We got this son of a bitch.
Clear!
Dewey!
Even when cops do everything right, things can still go sideways.
Learning to accept this is a big part of the job.
Hold on, hold on.
You of all people, will you please pull over?
Oh, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
No.
It gets better.
"Exactly how the grisly photos of the pop star's headless body
"got leaked to TMZ remains a mystery.
"But secret sources tell us they were snapped
"with Detective Adams' cellphone.
"Doesn't take a genius.
Might be time for her to start scanning the want ads."
Who reads this shit anyway?
Are you kidding me?
It's L.A. who doesn't?
Well, at least the department doesn't care.
Hey, aren't you on your way to a homicide?
Yeah, and the dead guy will probably have one of these in his pocket.
What happened to Lydia the optimist?
She got her ass handed to her by Lydia the suspect.
You think Fernandez is gonna fight for me with I.A. breathing down her neck?
Well, look, I mean, you answered their questions.
Okay, you showed them your bank accounts.
There's no proof that you got paid.
I mean, lots of people had access to the murder book where you put the photos.
So there's no proof that you leaked them.
I mean...
It's gonna be okay.
Yeah.
Maybe you're right.
Petey, come on, breakfast!
Tommy, no banging.
I can't find my shoes.
Uh, that's because it's in the fireplace.
We -- we were just horsing around.
God, it doesn't stop.
I guess these two are gonna fix the fence and maybe the sprinklers.
Everybody wants to help out.
You promised me to my face at the last community meeting that you'd get that thing hauled away.
But still one month later, my kids got to watch guys pissing in the alley and strawberries turning tricks.
The city told me that they were gonna take care of that.
More cops.
Just like clockwork.
You gonna pass the buck, too?
'Cause he just keeps on telling me, and somehow, that thing's still here.
I like this lady, but she's starting to get on my nerves.
Still, sucks that her kids got to see this.
You know what sucks is we get the gun, the big stick, and they think we have all the power.
Then when they realize we don't, they get all mouthy with us.
That's what sucks.
- Hey, how you doing?
- Good.
What's up?
Good.
Yeah.
Hang on a second.
You guys raided this house and this trailer about two months ago, right?
Yeah. 40k of rock, all in a day's work.
Excuse me.
This -- this house, it's slated for demo, isn't it?
Yeah, that's the word.
- That's the word.
- So what's up with the trailer?
You guys having trouble getting that cleared?
It's not our call, man.
We're still waiting on paperwork.
Till then, it's private property.
Oh, private property.
So you guys got yourselves a warrant, then, right?
You mind if I take a look at that?
See, here's my problem, fellas.
You got yourself a little felony bus stop here.
Anytime you need a felony bust, you just drive on by.
Well, like you, we don't make the laws, remember?
Excuse us.
We're done, huh?
What the hell, Sal?
A double murder on Vermont, and you give it to Faloona and Mills?
- I'm next in the rotation.
- I took you out.
Why?
Because some B.S.S. asshole doesn't want me riding alone?
Sammy -- you're listening to these people?
The shrink I talked to for 10 minutes, he doesn't know shit about being a cop.
Sit down.
He probably hasn't been south of the 10.
Look, Sammy.
Some git cops came in last night and brought in a suspect in Nate's murder.
Shit.
S-so, did they raid the guy's place?
They did but came up with nothing.
Nothing?
No blood?
Nothing on his clothes?
Lab's still checking, all right, but it doesn't look good.
Look, all they really got is a snitch who'll swear the guy did it, and he's a base-head.
Not much of a witness, you know?
Well, when can I I.D. him?
They're putting together a six-pack, so it's just gonna take an extra beat.
Sammy, we got to make this thing squeaky clean.
You understand?
Hey, the varsity team.
- Hey.
- Hey.
All right, so far we got 10 shell casings --
.22s and .38s.
And this guy was the target?
No, doesn't look to be.
I got a witness over there who says that these two assholes went after each other.
Bang, bang, bang.
They get away.
And this poor guy gets caught in the crossfire.
Wedding band, no tats.
I hate these.
You get a statement from him?
Yeah, started to, but then you guys came.
His name's Henry Watts.
You want to talk?
Yeah.
You take the body?
Yeah, sure.
Hey, Mr. Watts, how you doing?
I'm Detective Adams.
Hi.
Good to meet you.
You sure you're okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
It's just when the shooting started,
I dove between two cars.
Guess I just...
banged my head.
You should let the paramedics check you out.
You could have a concussion.
I'd be surprised if that were true.
I'm told I'm very hardheaded.
So, what exactly happened?
Uh, well, I came out of there with some groceries, saw two guys arguing.
Next thing I know, they're pulling out guns.
I mean, it was nuts.
They started shooting at each other from like 10 feet apart.
That poor guy there was just trying to get out of the way.
You think you could I.D. the guys?
I certainly could try.
Uh, hey, guys, can you come over here for a sec?
Um, let them check you out, okay?
Yeah.
Okay, okay.
Maybe they should.
Hey, Adams.
We think you're a lot hotter in person, if you don't mind us saying.
Munoz, come on, isn't there something else you could be doing, like traffic control maybe?
Oh!
Lydia, we don't think you did it.
Let's go.
Hey.
What's going on?
This man doesn't have a concussion.
He has a bullet in his head.
No, Ma'am...wh...
When I spoke to you guys last month you told me that the house and the trailer were both gonna be cleared -- ma'am --
Okay.
Well, you got my number.
Thanks.
And we wonder why people go postal.
Great.
Now this.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
All right!
Stop it right now!
Stop it!
What are you doing in front of these kids, huh?
What are we teaching them?
Share and share alike.
They don't got that in Armenia?
- I'm Turkish.
- I'm from Jordan.
That's fine!
You work it out.
Just switch off days or something.
You guys can do that, right?
Fine.
I'll take the weekends.
You stupid terrorist!
Terrorist?
!
Yeah.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
All right, all right, all right, all right.
Hook him up.
Hook him up.
He's selling guns to kids.
Look.
And I'm the terrorist?
You know what?
I need sugar.
You?
Hey, everybody!
It's your lucky day!
Free ice cream, courtesy of the Los Angeles Police Department.
There you go, buddy.
Have a bomb pop.
And furthermore, the investigating officers are deliberately not present, nor have their identities been made known to Detective Bryant.
Taking every precaution, this six-pack I.D.
Will be handled by Detective Olati Johnson of the domestic violence table.
She has no knowledge of the case.
Olati?
The photos you're about to see may or may not contain the person responsible for Nate Moretta's murder.
If you understand this and the rest of the admonitions, please sign here.
Do you see anyone you recognize?
Take your time, Sammy.
Excuse me.
You all right?
I saw his face, Sal.
I just...
I just needed some air.
All right.
That's cool.
Just take a little breather, then.
We'll go back in, all right?
Tomorrow.
I need a day.
Sammy, you're not sure, are you?
I just said I saw him.
I just...
It's just harder than I expected.
Sammy, this guy has an attorney breathing down my neck.
Without an I.D., we might have to kick him.
Can't we just stall?
We do it all the time for shit that doesn't even matter.
Come on, Sal.
What's the big deal?
All right.
I'll do what I can, all right?
I need you to focus.
We need this, Sammy, all right?
Yeah.
We went lights and sirens for this?
Dude, are you kidding me, man?
I had to get you here before the coroner moved the body.
Check this out.
You know how they always say TV kills brain cells?
Voilà.
You got to be shitting me.
What the hell happened?
Let me clue you in, Sherlock.
Pussy Galore over there said that he liked to do it while watching porn.
He also liked the bottom.
So he mounted the TV up there, pulled it out over the top of them, but I guess he wasn't too handy, because he used the wrong screws.
Where was she when this happened?
She said it missed her head by an inch.
I always say, blow jobs can save lives.
Hey.
How you doing?
For a guy with a .22 slug in his head?
I guess the answer's...good.
They said if you're feeling up to it that we can ask you a couple questions.
That'll distract me.
Please, shoot.
I mean...
You're an artist?
Uh, computer graphics mostly.
Got to eat.
But every now and then, I go old school.
Nothing like a pencil and pad.
This what you want to know?
Wow.
That's amazing.
So the guys were black?
Light-skinned, yeah.
One of them had a tattoo.
I couldn't see it clearly.
And they were dressed like this?
Wife-beaters and bling?
Yeah.
One of them wore an Angels cap.
This is amazing.
Did either of them have a car?
Not that I saw.
Hey.
Hi.
Um, doc wants to see us a sec.
Okay.
I think we're about to get the "leave him alone and let him rest" speech.
Ah, before neurosurgery?
Probably smart.
Is there anyone I can call for you?
Oh, my fiancée's in Rome for work.
I called her.
She'll be on her way back soon.
Good.
I'll be back in a bit.
I'd get what you need from him as soon as possible.
Yeah, I was kind of trying to do that.
He doesn't have long, okay?
I'm just giving you the heads-up.
What?
The bullet entered the skull and settled posterior of the optic chiasm.
He's got increasing intracranial pressure.
In English.
The thing is small and really deep in his brain.
Any operation to remove it will most likely kill him.
But he's -- he's -- he's talking.
He seems fine.
That's not gonna last.
Well, are you gonna tell him?
Not yet.
We're waiting on Keith Black, the top guy at Cedars, to take a look at his scans.
Maybe he'll have a different take, but I doubt it.
Sorry.
I got to go.
Um, Fernandez wants us back now.
Of course she does.
It's not just you, okay?
You, those R.H.D. guys, and the six patrol officers that were first on the scene are now suspended from duty.
You've been assigned home pending an internal investigation.
Are we getting paid?
Are we getting paid?
Yeah, with all benefits.
That's good with me, 'cause I didn't nada.
I'm just gonna get caught up on my Internet shopping.
Am I supposed to just sit home and do nothing?
"Assigned home" means that during working hours, you are to stay at home.
Well, are you gonna put an ankle bracelet on me?
'Cause if not, I'm gonna do as I please.
You have my cellphone number.
You can reach me.
Oh, no.
You took my cellphone.
I'm gonna have to note that on the file.
Oh, I'm really worried now.
What's up?
Pulled a traffic warrant on him.
It's bullshit, but it'll hold him till tomorrow.
His attorney saw the video of your six-pack I.D.
Now he's demanding that I do a lineup with his client in it.
Good.
Better than looking at mug shots, you know?
The asshole's standing right in front of me.
Yeah.
Get a good night's sleep, all right?
The lineup's tomorrow, 0900.
So...
The doctor read you the riot act?
Yes, but I charmed her.
Oh.
The nurses brought me some art supplies up from the kids' ward.
Figure as long as I can draw, right, how bad can it be?
Definitely, yeah.
Everybody seems really optimistic.
They got this famous neurosurgeon coming in to review my CAT scan.
Then they're gonna settle on what to do.
The surgery's tricky, obviously.
They just want to do their homework.
Look, Mr. Watts --
Henry.
Henry.
About the case --
Oh, yeah, I remembered -- the guy in the hat yelled the other guy's name.
Leon, Dion, something like that.
No, I needed to tell you I'm no longer on the case.
There will be two new detectives, and they'll be coming around soon.
Oh.
I see.
You're that Detective Adams.
Lydia, I guess.
Yes.
My fame precedes me.
I saw it on TV.
On an endless loop.
So, did you leak the photos?
No.
I believe you.
Thanks.
I appreciate it.
So, I guess you're gonna be going, now that you're off the case?
I'm gonna stay a bit and brief the detectives when they get here.
Might as well.
Avoid the paparazzi?
Hmm.
That too.
Yeah.
And listen, um...
In case I go into surgery before Jessie, my fiancée, gets here, could you, um...
Could you let her know our dogs are with the neighbors?
Or could you get the detectives to tell her?
Sure, sure, sure.
I will make sure she gets the message.
I'm feeling...
kind of tired.
Gonna try and catch a nap.
Okay.
I'll check in in a bit.
Yeah.
I've called three times today.
I've spoken to five different clerks.
Sure as shit, the windows are blacked out.
I know you keep saying that, but I need to know when.
Banging around on the inside.
So finally I get the door pried open, and -- bwah!
-- this frickin' vulture comes flying out with an ear hanging in its beak.
I look inside, and the guy just blew his head off with a 12 gauge.
How'd the bird get in there?
It got in through the hole in the roof that the gun made, man.
It scared the shit out of me.
Shit.
Shit, beats the hell out of mine.
Just some poor old guy, ass up in the air, next to the toilet.
Blah, blah, blah.
That's a dime a dozen, man.
The extra pressure caused a heart attack.
I heard it a million times.
Speaking of shotguns, you heard this one?
So, Koreatown, one of those rooms you rent by the hour.
- How much you pay for that?
- Hey, relax.
We find this dead guy, right?
He's completely naked, chest blown out, lying on a bed, shards of mirror sticking out of his stomach, his neck, his face.
I got this.
I got this.
He's laying on the bed next to his shotty, right?
He killed himself with his legs up in the air.
He's got a pencil through his toes crossed through the trigger guard.
He pulls the trigger with his feet.
The recoil of the gun kicks it up into the ceiling, smashing the mirror.
Am I close?
Huh?
I heard that one, man.
You're gonna have to try a little bit harder, hello?
But I'll still buy your dirty ass lunch.
What?
Shit.
She just hung up on me.
Why do you even care, man?
I find it novel, Dewey, every once in a while to give a shit.
You know, when you called me and said you were at the hospital,
I thought you'd gone 51/50 on me.
Trust me, I am this close.
Nozick and Chavez?
Left them three voicemails, and neither one of them will call me back.
Yeah, they're working a stabbing in Lynwood, probably got their hands full.
Yeah, but this is priority.
The witness may not last.
It's not your case now.
Why are you making it harder for yourself?
'Cause it's not just about me, and I don't want to see them screw this up.
Fernandez told the cap that you weren't gonna go home.
And I thought her head was gonna explode, you know?
So she sent you here to convince me?
Well, her language was a bit stronger.
Yeah, well, snap a picture and leak her a photo of this.
Thought you might feel that way.
I cannot believe this is happening, Russ.
All my hard work, my rep.
It's all going to crap now.
Leak cases are hard to prove.
Once the dog-and-pony show's over, everything will settle down.
So you just got to wait it out.
If you're wrong, will you at least be my lead rep?
Go through all of this with me?
Don't they assign guys to do that from the league?
Yeah, but I don't trust anybody else.
No, I-I don't have any experience.
Yeah, but you've got my back.
Of course.
Okay.
It's late.
Yeah, just about done here.
You been coming around a lot.
You know, doing what I can.
Just trying to help her out, you know?
That all you want to do, help her?
What'd you say?
You heard what I said.
You accuse me of trying to move in on the widow?
You're the one living in her house, asshole.
You don't know shit about what's going on, so I suggest you keep your mouth shut.
I know you sleep here now, don't you?
Doesn't take a genius to figure out what that means.
Nate was my partner.
I'm looking after his family the way he would've wanted.
Yeah?
You got that?
Yeah.
Is that clear to you?
Yeah.
Get the Out of here.
You know what?
You need to get some help.
Do I?
Yeah.
See ya.
Yeah.
Shit.
It's called trephination, or burr holes, to relieve the pressure.
Okay, but if you're gonna drill in my head, why not just dig the bullet out?
You're still bleeding, Mr. Watts.
This has to happen now.
Then we can pursue our options.
- Like what?
- Dr. Bernheimer will be talking to you.
No.
Why can't you tell me?
And what about the guy at Cedars?
We're all still reviewing things.
Please lie back.
All asleep.
Pretty amazing, actually.
You're good with kids, Sammy.
I don't know about that.
I think they just sense that I'm one of them.
You went at Stiles pretty good back there.
Oh.
I thought you were gonna deck him.
That -
- I'm sorry.
I'm an idiot.
No.
I'm sure you're just stressed about the lineup tomorrow.
Everyone's talking about it, how it's all up to you.
Well, if I recognize him --
I mean, if it's the guy, I'll recognize him.
And...
If I do, we'll take him down.
I promise.
What are we doing, Sammy?
Hey, buddy.
I'm thirsty.
Okay, baby, I'll get you water.
So, you're gonna be my dad now?
Okay.
Come on.
Let's go inside.
Hey.
If you want me to come back, I can.
Come in.
Come in.
They, um -- they tell you about...
I got...
Two new holes...
In my head.
Ease the pressure, I guess.
Beyond that, I don't know.
Seems like no one wants to operate.
Or no one knows how.
You heard about Jessica?
Uh, no, just, um, she's on her way.
Yeah, I know.
You know what she does for a living?
Writes children's books.
Really good ones about a lizard named Fig.
- You have any kids?
- No.
Then you probably never heard of a lizard named Fig.
It's really good.
It's how we met.
I did the illustrations for her second book.
And we just...
Fell in love.
Just jumped right into it.
Still can't believe how lucky I got.
What would you do...
If you were me?
Would you go under the knife for the 1% chance at living, or would you try to hold out for a chance to say goodbye?
Oh, I don't --
I --
I was in love once.
Yeah?
Yeah, it was my second training officer when I just joined the force, and...
He was married with kids, and when he decided to leave his wife...
Things got ugly real fast.
What happened?
We figured it out.
We figured out a way to be together.
And then he was killed on the job.
A shootout at an auto-parts store.
It was senseless, but...
But I had been reassigned.
So I wasn't there to say goodbye.
And that...
If you love her...
Hold out.
That'd be my answer.
I'm gonna let you get some rest, okay?
Don't -- don't.
Please.
This was set for 9:00.
It's now going on 11:00.
I don't work here, sir.
You're gonna have to take that up with the sheriff's department.
And don't think I don't know the irregularities with my client's traffic warrant were a direct result of your stalling.
I'm just a cop, counselor.
Fewer words would be good.
Now, if you could just stand the over there, please?
Thank you.
So, we good to go?
Sammy?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Detective Bryant, do you recognize any of the individuals standing before you?
Right before he hit Nate, he said, "toma puto."
Could I have number 2, 3 repeat that for me?
Number 2, take one step forward and say, "toma puto."
Toma puto.
Step back.
Okay, now number 3.
Toma puto.
S-- can 6 take his hand out of his pocket?
Number 6, take your hand out of your pocket.
3.
Number 3.
You're saying you recognize number 3?
It's number 3.
Okay, we're done.
Number 2.
Number 2.
I meant number 2.
It's number 2.
Okay?
Let's go.
Number 2 is an inmate here, Sammy.
He got extra food for standing in the lineup.
That's -- that's just great.
Terrific.
Thank you.
No.
Yeah.
Okay, you too.
Well, good news.
Some desk jockey just forgot to sign a form.
So they moved the crack trailer this morning.
All right.
So now we're going to double-check.
You trust anything the city tells you?
No.
Geez, that sucks.
Okay, bye.
Nate Moretta -- that cop who got murdered?
Yeah.
His partner picked the wrong guy in a lineup.
Ouch!
Notify the suicide hotline.
Dewey.
I'm just saying, man.
You know how it is.
They're gonna be watching his ass.
All units and A35, 211 in progress, 1620 Fuega.
Light them up.
Freeze!
Drop the knife!
Drop it!
Follow me in the car!
Stop!
Stop right now!
That's it.
Thank you.
I'm gonna borrow this.
Hey, jag-off.
Not rampart?
You're learning.
Give me a hand.
Muchachos...
Venga ayudarnos, por favor.
Stop!
He's getting in a car.
Right behind you, partner.
Gold Ford.
License plate -
- Victor-4-7.
Go!
Gracias, amigo.
Gracias.
Yeah.
Yeah, this is John Cooper with the Los Angeles Police Department.
Yeah, how you doing?
I got an abandoned vehicle blocking the alley behind 226 Vernon.
Yeah.
All right, I appreciate it.
A35, we're in pursuit of a gold Ford Contour, now westbound on Florence at Brighton.
A43, show us en route to back.
Suspect just turned, westbound on Selma from Cahuenga.
Man #2:
Air-3, what's the speed of the suspect's vehicle, and what are the conditions?
No, no, no, do not call off this chase!
Clear!
70, 75.
Traffic's moderate, non-residential.
A43, show us as a secondary unit in pursuit.
Approaching a no-fly zone.
Got to back off.
Primary unit, you have it.
We got this
Clear.
We're clear.
A35, suspect heading northbound now -
- Schrader.
We got this son of a bitch.
Clear!
Dewey!
Damn!
God damn.
Damn it.
We got to keep going.
Jesus.
Woman down.
She just came out of nowhere!
Shit!
Hey!
Freeze!
Let me see your hands now!
Get your hands up!
Get your hands out of the car!
Put your hands up!
Let's go!
Hands up now!
A43, show us code 6, corner of Yucca and Argyle.
Does she have a pulse?
Oh, God.
Oh, God!
God damn it!
One, two...
You got him?
Yeah, I got him, I got him, I got him.
All right, we got two pinned.
You okay, ma'am?
Somebody's coming, ma'am.
No, I can't move my legs!
Okay.
It's okay.
19, 20... 21, 22, 23, 24.
Come on, come on.
It's over.
It's over, man.
It's over.
She's dead.
Eggs.
Can I get you something?
I forgot them at the store.
How could you forget that?
Weren't they on your list?
Yeah.
Yeah, but...
Henry.
Jessica.
God, baby.
How do you feel?
Jess.
When are you having surgery?
What's -- uh...
Oh, I told them I was gonna wait for you to get here.
So...
Dewey told me already, John.
All part of God's plan.
Don't make me tell you to off, too.
Look, what happened was tragic, all right?
But we did what we were supposed to.
We lost air support.
We were primary.
It was my responsibility.
I could have called it off.
She stepped right in front of you.
There were sirens, lights flashing.
You know the funniest part?
I wasn't gonna be a cop.
I was just gonna surf.
I don't know.
Bartend.
But then getting pregnant, my marriage blowing up.
I had a kid.
I needed a job.
That was all this was supposed to be.
How many surfers run toward gunfire?
Hmm?
How many?
Teachers, bartenders -- they just jump in their car and go after these assholes?
No.
No, and until they do, you cut yourself a break.
I-I got to go pick up Tristan.
If not you, who?
Who, Chickie?
Who deserves to be wearing that uniform?
Um, Detective?
She was right there with him when he died.
I knew you'd want to know.
Thanks.
And, Detective...
I couldn't help hearing what you said to him.
It was...
It was beautiful.
I'm just sorry that you had to go through that.
I just made that up, actually.
Just wanted to give him strength, you know?
Really?
It felt so honest and heartfelt and...
Cops -- good storytellers.
We agreed that you would not come here.
I got no place to go.
Well, you can't stay here.
Jesus!
Wh--
What is it?
I up.
Everything I touch...
Everything just turns to shit.
Everything.
W-- what -- what did you do?
It's what I didn't -- it's what I couldn't --
it's what I couldn't do.
Hey, hey.
I couldn't.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Sammy.
Sammy.
Come on.
Sammy.
- Hey.
- Hey.
How you doing?
You came to check on me.
Come on.
I need a drink.
You all right?
Have you, um...
Heard the news at all lately?
Do you that they kicked that guy in the Moretta case?
Yeah, man.
I guess when it rains, it pours.
You heard a patrol cop killed a pedestrian in the 77th?
High-speed chase.
She just walked into traffic.
Yeah, I heard that.
And now I'm about to lose my job for leaking photos of a dead celebrity.
All these years of being a good cop, and that's my Google hit.
Lydia.
No, it's gonna happen, Russ.
I can feel it.
Just all the rage I feel, you know?
Just I'm up all night.
Who could do this?
Not just to me, but to us.
I did.
Come on, Russ.
It's not funny.
I, uh, gave them a couple photos, and they paid me half a million bucks.
What, was I gonna be a secretary the rest of my life?
Scrape by on disability, if they even gave it to me?
It, Lyd.
I saw my chance, so I took it.
If I had known that the photos were from your phone,
I wouldn't have done it.
I just told Fernandez an hour ago, got my ass reamed by the chief.
Took them all of a minute to fire me.
At least it hurts a lot less with cash in the bank.
You did it for the money?
No.
No.
No!
I wouldn't -- it looked like that asshole actor chopped his girlfriend's head off.
I mean, especially celebrities -- they have those lawyers and those fancy handlers, and...
You know, the public has to know when vicious shit like that goes down.
He was innocent.
He shot himself.
I know.
I couldn't have predicted that.
But the bottom line is...
I'm sorry.
I know you went through a lot for that and it messed you up.
And I wish --
I should've told you sooner.
That was wrong.
I don't even know you.
Lydia.
I don't even know you, dude.
Lydia, please.
Come on.
Lydia!

Suspect just turned, westbound on Selma from Cahuenga.
Man #2:
Air-3, what's the speed of the suspect's vehicle, and what are the conditions?
No, no, no, do not call off this chase!
Clear!
70, 75.
Traffic's moderate, non-residential.
A43, show us as a secondary unit in pursuit.
Approaching a no-fly zone.
Got to back off.
- Primary unit, you have it.
- We got this
Clear.
We're clear.
A35, suspect heading northbound now -
- Schrader.
We got this son of a bitch.
Clear!
Dewey!
Even when cops do everything right, things can still go sideways.
Learning to accept this is a big part of the job.
Hold on, hold on.
You of all people, will you please pull over?
Oh, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
No.
It gets better.
"Exactly how the grisly photos of the pop star's headless body
"got leaked to TMZ remains a mystery.
"But secret sources tell us they were snapped
"with Detective Adams' cellphone.
"Doesn't take a genius.
Might be time for her to start scanning the want ads."
Who reads this shit anyway?
Are you kidding me?
It's L.A. who doesn't?
Well, at least the department doesn't care.
Hey, aren't you on your way to a homicide?
Yeah, and the dead guy will probably have one of these in his pocket.
What happened to Lydia the optimist?
She got her ass handed to her by Lydia the suspect.
You think Fernandez is gonna fight for me with I.A. breathing down her neck?
Well, look, I mean, you answered their questions.
Okay, you showed them your bank accounts.
There's no proof that you got paid.
I mean, lots of people had access to the murder book where you put the photos.
So there's no proof that you leaked them.
I mean...
It's gonna be okay.
Yeah.
Maybe you're right.
Petey, come on, breakfast!
Tommy, no banging.
I can't find my shoes.
Uh, that's because it's in the fireplace.
We -- we were just horsing around.
God, it doesn't stop.
I guess these two are gonna fix the fence and maybe the sprinklers.
Everybody wants to help out.
You promised me to my face at the last community meeting that you'd get that thing hauled away.
But still one month later, my kids got to watch guys pissing in the alley and strawberries turning tricks.
The city told me that they were gonna take care of that.
More cops.
Just like clockwork.
You gonna pass the buck, too?
'Cause he just keeps on telling me, and somehow, that thing's still here.
I like this lady, but she's starting to get on my nerves.
Still, sucks that her kids got to see this.
You know what sucks is we get the gun, the big stick, and they think we have all the power.
Then when they realize we don't, they get all mouthy with us.
That's what sucks.
- Hey, how you doing?
- Good.
What's up?
Good.
Yeah.
Hang on a second.
You guys raided this house and this trailer about two months ago, right?
Yeah. 40k of rock, all in a day's work.
Excuse me.
This -- this house, it's slated for demo, isn't it?
Yeah, that's the word.
- That's the word.
- So what's up with the trailer?
You guys having trouble getting that cleared?
It's not our call, man.
We're still waiting on paperwork.
Till then, it's private property.
Oh, private property.
So you guys got yourselves a warrant, then, right?
You mind if I take a look at that?
See, here's my problem, fellas.
You got yourself a little felony bus stop here.
Anytime you need a felony bust, you just drive on by.
Well, like you, we don't make the laws, remember?
Excuse us.
We're done, huh?
What the hell, Sal?
A double murder on Vermont, and you give it to Faloona and Mills?
- I'm next in the rotation.
- I took you out.
Why?
Because some B.S.S. asshole doesn't want me riding alone?
Sammy -- you're listening to these people?
The shrink I talked to for 10 minutes, he doesn't know shit about being a cop.
Sit down.
He probably hasn't been south of the 10.
Look, Sammy.
Some git cops came in last night and brought in a suspect in Nate's murder.
Shit.
S-so, did they raid the guy's place?
They did but came up with nothing.
Nothing?
No blood?
Nothing on his clothes?
Lab's still checking, all right, but it doesn't look good.
Look, all they really got is a snitch who'll swear the guy did it, and he's a base-head.
Not much of a witness, you know?
Well, when can I I.D. him?
They're putting together a six-pack, so it's just gonna take an extra beat.
Sammy, we got to make this thing squeaky clean.
You understand?
Hey, the varsity team.
- Hey.
- Hey.
All right, so far we got 10 shell casings --
.22s and .38s.
And this guy was the target?
No, doesn't look to be.
I got a witness over there who says that these two assholes went after each other.
Bang, bang, bang.
They get away.
And this poor guy gets caught in the crossfire.
Wedding band, no tats.
I hate these.
You get a statement from him?
Yeah, started to, but then you guys came.
His name's Henry Watts.
You want to talk?
Yeah.
You take the body?
Yeah, sure.
Hey, Mr. Watts, how you doing?
I'm Detective Adams.
Hi.
Good to meet you.
You sure you're okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
It's just when the shooting started,
I dove between two cars.
Guess I just...
banged my head.
You should let the paramedics check you out.
You could have a concussion.
I'd be surprised if that were true.
I'm told I'm very hardheaded.
So, what exactly happened?
Uh, well, I came out of there with some groceries, saw two guys arguing.
Next thing I know, they're pulling out guns.
I mean, it was nuts.
They started shooting at each other from like 10 feet apart.
That poor guy there was just trying to get out of the way.
You think you could I.D. the guys?
I certainly could try.
Uh, hey, guys, can you come over here for a sec?
Um, let them check you out, okay?
Yeah.
Okay, okay.
Maybe they should.
Hey, Adams.
We think you're a lot hotter in person, if you don't mind us saying.
Munoz, come on, isn't there something else you could be doing, like traffic control maybe?
Oh!
Lydia, we don't think you did it.
Let's go.
Hey.
What's going on?
This man doesn't have a concussion.
He has a bullet in his head.
No, Ma'am...wh...
When I spoke to you guys last month you told me that the house and the trailer were both gonna be cleared -- ma'am --
Okay.
Well, you got my number.
Thanks.
And we wonder why people go postal.
Great.
Now this.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
All right!
Stop it right now!
Stop it!
What are you doing in front of these kids, huh?
What are we teaching them?
Share and share alike.
They don't got that in Armenia?
- I'm Turkish.
- I'm from Jordan.
That's fine!
You work it out.
Just switch off days or something.
You guys can do that, right?
Fine.
I'll take the weekends.
You stupid terrorist!
Terrorist?
!
Yeah.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
All right, all right, all right, all right.
Hook him up.
Hook him up.
He's selling guns to kids.
Look.
And I'm the terrorist?
You know what?
I need sugar.
You?
Hey, everybody!
It's your lucky day!
Free ice cream, courtesy of the Los Angeles Police Department.
There you go, buddy.
Have a bomb pop.
And furthermore, the investigating officers are deliberately not present, nor have their identities been made known to Detective Bryant.
Taking every precaution, this six-pack I.D.
Will be handled by Detective Olati Johnson of the domestic violence table.
She has no knowledge of the case.
Olati?
The photos you're about to see may or may not contain the person responsible for Nate Moretta's murder.
If you understand this and the rest of the admonitions, please sign here.
Do you see anyone you recognize?
Take your time, Sammy.
Excuse me.
You all right?
I saw his face, Sal.
I just...
I just needed some air.
All right.
That's cool.
Just take a little breather, then.
We'll go back in, all right?
Tomorrow.
I need a day.
Sammy, you're not sure, are you?
I just said I saw him.
I just...
It's just harder than I expected.
Sammy, this guy has an attorney breathing down my neck.
Without an I.D., we might have to kick him.
Can't we just stall?
We do it all the time for shit that doesn't even matter.
Come on, Sal.
What's the big deal?
All right.
I'll do what I can, all right?
I need you to focus.
We need this, Sammy, all right?
Yeah.
We went lights and sirens for this?
Dude, are you kidding me, man?
I had to get you here before the coroner moved the body.
Check this out.
You know how they always say TV kills brain cells?
Voilà.
You got to be shitting me.
What the hell happened?
Let me clue you in, Sherlock.
Pussy Galore over there said that he liked to do it while watching porn.
He also liked the bottom.
So he mounted the TV up there, pulled it out over the top of them, but I guess he wasn't too handy, because he used the wrong screws.
Where was she when this happened?
She said it missed her head by an inch.
I always say, blow jobs can save lives.
Hey.
How you doing?
For a guy with a .22 slug in his head?
I guess the answer's...good.
They said if you're feeling up to it that we can ask you a couple questions.
That'll distract me.
Please, shoot.
I mean...
You're an artist?
Uh, computer graphics mostly.
Got to eat.
But every now and then, I go old school.
Nothing like a pencil and pad.
This what you want to know?
Wow.
That's amazing.
So the guys were black?
Light-skinned, yeah.
One of them had a tattoo.
I couldn't see it clearly.
And they were dressed like this?
Wife-beaters and bling?
Yeah.
One of them wore an Angels cap.
This is amazing.
Did either of them have a car?
Not that I saw.
Hey.
Hi.
Um, doc wants to see us a sec.
Okay.
I think we're about to get the "leave him alone and let him rest" speech.
Ah, before neurosurgery?
Probably smart.
Is there anyone I can call for you?
Oh, my fiancée's in Rome for work.
I called her.
She'll be on her way back soon.
Good.
I'll be back in a bit.
I'd get what you need from him as soon as possible.
Yeah, I was kind of trying to do that.
He doesn't have long, okay?
I'm just giving you the heads-up.
What?
The bullet entered the skull and settled posterior of the optic chiasm.
He's got increasing intracranial pressure.
In English.
The thing is small and really deep in his brain.
Any operation to remove it will most likely kill him.
But he's -- he's -- he's talking.
He seems fine.
That's not gonna last.
Well, are you gonna tell him?
Not yet.
We're waiting on Keith Black, the top guy at Cedars, to take a look at his scans.
Maybe he'll have a different take, but I doubt it.
Sorry.
I got to go.
Um, Fernandez wants us back now.
Of course she does.
It's not just you, okay?
You, those R.H.D. guys, and the six patrol officers that were first on the scene are now suspended from duty.
You've been assigned home pending an internal investigation.
Are we getting paid?
Are we getting paid?
Yeah, with all benefits.
That's good with me, 'cause I didn't nada.
I'm just gonna get caught up on my Internet shopping.
Am I supposed to just sit home and do nothing?
"Assigned home" means that during working hours, you are to stay at home.
Well, are you gonna put an ankle bracelet on me?
'Cause if not, I'm gonna do as I please.
You have my cellphone number.
You can reach me.
Oh, no.
You took my cellphone.
I'm gonna have to note that on the file.
Oh, I'm really worried now.
What's up?
Pulled a traffic warrant on him.
It's bullshit, but it'll hold him till tomorrow.
His attorney saw the video of your six-pack I.D.
Now he's demanding that I do a lineup with his client in it.
Good.
Better than looking at mug shots, you know?
The asshole's standing right in front of me.
Yeah.
Get a good night's sleep, all right?
The lineup's tomorrow, 0900.
So...
The doctor read you the riot act?
Yes, but I charmed her.
Oh.
The nurses brought me some art supplies up from the kids' ward.
Figure as long as I can draw, right, how bad can it be?
Definitely, yeah.
Everybody seems really optimistic.
They got this famous neurosurgeon coming in to review my CAT scan.
Then they're gonna settle on what to do.
The surgery's tricky, obviously.
They just want to do their homework.
Look, Mr. Watts --
Henry.
Henry.
About the case --
Oh, yeah, I remembered -- the guy in the hat yelled the other guy's name.
Leon, Dion, something like that.
No, I needed to tell you I'm no longer on the case.
There will be two new detectives, and they'll be coming around soon.
Oh.
I see.
You're that Detective Adams.
Lydia, I guess.
Yes.
My fame precedes me.
I saw it on TV.
On an endless loop.
So, did you leak the photos?
No.
I believe you.
Thanks.
I appreciate it.
So, I guess you're gonna be going, now that you're off the case?
I'm gonna stay a bit and brief the detectives when they get here.
Might as well.
Avoid the paparazzi?
Hmm.
That too.
Yeah.
And listen, um...
In case I go into surgery before Jessie, my fiancée, gets here, could you, um...
Could you let her know our dogs are with the neighbors?
Or could you get the detectives to tell her?
Sure, sure, sure.
I will make sure she gets the message.
I'm feeling...
kind of tired.
Gonna try and catch a nap.
Okay.
I'll check in in a bit.
Yeah.
I've called three times today.
I've spoken to five different clerks.
Sure as shit, the windows are blacked out.
I know you keep saying that, but I need to know when.
Banging around on the inside.
So finally I get the door pried open, and -- bwah!
-- this frickin' vulture comes flying out with an ear hanging in its beak.
I look inside, and the guy just blew his head off with a 12 gauge.
How'd the bird get in there?
It got in through the hole in the roof that the gun made, man.
It scared the shit out of me.
Shit.
Shit, beats the hell out of mine.
Just some poor old guy, ass up in the air, next to the toilet.
Blah, blah, blah.
That's a dime a dozen, man.
The extra pressure caused a heart attack.
I heard it a million times.
Speaking of shotguns, you heard this one?
So, Koreatown, one of those rooms you rent by the hour.
- How much you pay for that?
- Hey, relax.
We find this dead guy, right?
He's completely naked, chest blown out, lying on a bed, shards of mirror sticking out of his stomach, his neck, his face.
I got this.
I got this.
He's laying on the bed next to his shotty, right?
He killed himself with his legs up in the air.
He's got a pencil through his toes crossed through the trigger guard.
He pulls the trigger with his feet.
The recoil of the gun kicks it up into the ceiling, smashing the mirror.
Am I close?
Huh?
I heard that one, man.
You're gonna have to try a little bit harder, hello?
But I'll still buy your dirty ass lunch.
What?
Shit.
She just hung up on me.
Why do you even care, man?
I find it novel, Dewey, every once in a while to give a shit.
You know, when you called me and said you were at the hospital,
I thought you'd gone 51/50 on me.
Trust me, I am this close.
Nozick and Chavez?
Left them three voicemails, and neither one of them will call me back.
Yeah, they're working a stabbing in Lynwood, probably got their hands full.
Yeah, but this is priority.
The witness may not last.
It's not your case now.
Why are you making it harder for yourself?
'Cause it's not just about me, and I don't want to see them screw this up.
Fernandez told the cap that you weren't gonna go home.
And I thought her head was gonna explode, you know?
So she sent you here to convince me?
Well, her language was a bit stronger.
Yeah, well, snap a picture and leak her a photo of this.
Thought you might feel that way.
I cannot believe this is happening, Russ.
All my hard work, my rep.
It's all going to crap now.
Leak cases are hard to prove.
Once the dog-and-pony show's over, everything will settle down.
So you just got to wait it out.
If you're wrong, will you at least be my lead rep?
Go through all of this with me?
Don't they assign guys to do that from the league?
Yeah, but I don't trust anybody else.
No, I-I don't have any experience.
Yeah, but you've got my back.
Of course.
Okay.
It's late.
Yeah, just about done here.
You been coming around a lot.
You know, doing what I can.
Just trying to help her out, you know?
That all you want to do, help her?
What'd you say?
You heard what I said.
You accuse me of trying to move in on the widow?
You're the one living in her house, asshole.
You don't know shit about what's going on, so I suggest you keep your mouth shut.
I know you sleep here now, don't you?
Doesn't take a genius to figure out what that means.
Nate was my partner.
I'm looking after his family the way he would've wanted.
Yeah?
You got that?
Yeah.
Is that clear to you?
Yeah.
Get the Out of here.
You know what?
You need to get some help.
Do I?
Yeah.
See ya.
Yeah.
Shit.
It's called trephination, or burr holes, to relieve the pressure.
Okay, but if you're gonna drill in my head, why not just dig the bullet out?
You're still bleeding, Mr. Watts.
This has to happen now.
Then we can pursue our options.
- Like what?
- Dr. Bernheimer will be talking to you.
No.
Why can't you tell me?
And what about the guy at Cedars?
We're all still reviewing things.
Please lie back.
All asleep.
Pretty amazing, actually.
You're good with kids, Sammy.
I don't know about that.
I think they just sense that I'm one of them.
You went at Stiles pretty good back there.
Oh.
I thought you were gonna deck him.
That -
- I'm sorry.
I'm an idiot.
No.
I'm sure you're just stressed about the lineup tomorrow.
Everyone's talking about it, how it's all up to you.
Well, if I recognize him --
I mean, if it's the guy, I'll recognize him.
And...
If I do, we'll take him down.
I promise.
What are we doing, Sammy?
Hey, buddy.
I'm thirsty.
Okay, baby, I'll get you water.
So, you're gonna be my dad now?
Okay.
Come on.
Let's go inside.
Hey.
If you want me to come back, I can.
Come in.
Come in.
They, um -- they tell you about...
I got...
Two new holes...
In my head.
Ease the pressure, I guess.
Beyond that, I don't know.
Seems like no one wants to operate.
Or no one knows how.
You heard about Jessica?
Uh, no, just, um, she's on her way.
Yeah, I know.
You know what she does for a living?
Writes children's books.
Really good ones about a lizard named Fig.
- You have any kids?
- No.
Then you probably never heard of a lizard named Fig.
It's really good.
It's how we met.
I did the illustrations for her second book.
And we just...
Fell in love.
Just jumped right into it.
Still can't believe how lucky I got.
What would you do...
If you were me?
Would you go under the knife for the 1% chance at living, or would you try to hold out for a chance to say goodbye?
Oh, I don't --
I --
I was in love once.
Yeah?
Yeah, it was my second training officer when I just joined the force, and...
He was married with kids, and when he decided to leave his wife...
Things got ugly real fast.
What happened?
We figured it out.
We figured out a way to be together.
And then he was killed on the job.
A shootout at an auto-parts store.
It was senseless, but...
But I had been reassigned.
So I wasn't there to say goodbye.
And that...
If you love her...
Hold out.
That'd be my answer.
I'm gonna let you get some rest, okay?
Don't -- don't.
Please.
This was set for 9:00.
It's now going on 11:00.
I don't work here, sir.
You're gonna have to take that up with the sheriff's department.
And don't think I don't know the irregularities with my client's traffic warrant were a direct result of your stalling.
I'm just a cop, counselor.
Fewer words would be good.
Now, if you could just stand the over there, please?
Thank you.
So, we good to go?
Sammy?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Detective Bryant, do you recognize any of the individuals standing before you?
Right before he hit Nate, he said, "toma puto."
Could I have number 2, 3 repeat that for me?
Number 2, take one step forward and say, "toma puto."
Toma puto.
Step back.
Okay, now number 3.
Toma puto.
S-- can 6 take his hand out of his pocket?
Number 6, take your hand out of your pocket.
3.
Number 3.
You're saying you recognize number 3?
It's number 3.
Okay, we're done.
Number 2.
Number 2.
I meant number 2.
It's number 2.
Okay?
Let's go.
Number 2 is an inmate here, Sammy.
He got extra food for standing in the lineup.
That's -- that's just great.
Terrific.
Thank you.
No.
Yeah.
Okay, you too.
Well, good news.
Some desk jockey just forgot to sign a form.
So they moved the crack trailer this morning.
All right.
So now we're going to double-check.
You trust anything the city tells you?
No.
Geez, that sucks.
Okay, bye.
Nate Moretta -- that cop who got murdered?
Yeah.
His partner picked the wrong guy in a lineup.
Ouch!
Notify the suicide hotline.
Dewey.
I'm just saying, man.
You know how it is.
They're gonna be watching his ass.
All units and A35, 211 in progress, 1620 Fuega.
Light them up.
Freeze!
Drop the knife!
Drop it!
Follow me in the car!
Stop!
Stop right now!
That's it.
Thank you.
I'm gonna borrow this.
Hey, jag-off.
Not rampart?
You're learning.
Give me a hand.
Muchachos...
Venga ayudarnos, por favor.
Stop!
He's getting in a car.
Right behind you, partner.
Gold Ford.
License plate -
- Victor-4-7.
Go!
Gracias, amigo.
Gracias.
Yeah.
Yeah, this is John Cooper with the Los Angeles Police Department.
Yeah, how you doing?
I got an abandoned vehicle blocking the alley behind 226 Vernon.
Yeah.
All right, I appreciate it.
A35, we're in pursuit of a gold Ford Contour, now westbound on Florence at Brighton.
A43, show us en route to back.
Suspect just turned, westbound on Selma from Cahuenga.
Man #2:
Air-3, what's the speed of the suspect's vehicle, and what are the conditions?
No, no, no, do not call off this chase!
Clear!
70, 75.
Traffic's moderate, non-residential.
A43, show us as a secondary unit in pursuit.
Approaching a no-fly zone.
Got to back off.
Primary unit, you have it.
We got this
Clear.
We're clear.
A35, suspect heading northbound now -
- Schrader.
We got this son of a bitch.
Clear!
Dewey!
Damn!
God damn.
Damn it.
We got to keep going.
Jesus.
Woman down.
She just came out of nowhere!
Shit!
Hey!
Freeze!
Let me see your hands now!
Get your hands up!
Get your hands out of the car!
Put your hands up!
Let's go!
Hands up now!
A43, show us code 6, corner of Yucca and Argyle.
Does she have a pulse?
Oh, God.
Oh, God!
God damn it!
One, two...
You got him?
Yeah, I got him, I got him, I got him.
All right, we got two pinned.
You okay, ma'am?
Somebody's coming, ma'am.
No, I can't move my legs!
Okay.
It's okay.
19, 20... 21, 22, 23, 24.
Come on, come on.
It's over.
It's over, man.
It's over.
She's dead.
Eggs.
Can I get you something?
I forgot them at the store.
How could you forget that?
Weren't they on your list?
Yeah.
Yeah, but...
Henry.
Jessica.
God, baby.
How do you feel?
Jess.
When are you having surgery?
What's -- uh...
Oh, I told them I was gonna wait for you to get here.
So...
Dewey told me already, John.
All part of God's plan.
Don't make me tell you to off, too.
Look, what happened was tragic, all right?
But we did what we were supposed to.
We lost air support.
We were primary.
It was my responsibility.
I could have called it off.
She stepped right in front of you.
There were sirens, lights flashing.
You know the funniest part?
I wasn't gonna be a cop.
I was just gonna surf.
I don't know.
Bartend.
But then getting pregnant, my marriage blowing up.
I had a kid.
I needed a job.
That was all this was supposed to be.
How many surfers run toward gunfire?
Hmm?
How many?
Teachers, bartenders -- they just jump in their car and go after these assholes?
No.
No, and until they do, you cut yourself a break.
I-I got to go pick up Tristan.
If not you, who?
Who, Chickie?
Who deserves to be wearing that uniform?
Um, Detective?
She was right there with him when he died.
I knew you'd want to know.
Thanks.
And, Detective...
I couldn't help hearing what you said to him.
It was...
It was beautiful.
I'm just sorry that you had to go through that.
I just made that up, actually.
Just wanted to give him strength, you know?
Really?
It felt so honest and heartfelt and...
Cops -- good storytellers.
We agreed that you would not come here.
I got no place to go.
Well, you can't stay here.
Jesus!
Wh--
What is it?
I up.
Everything I touch...
Everything just turns to shit.
Everything.
W-- what -- what did you do?
It's what I didn't -- it's what I couldn't --
it's what I couldn't do.
Hey, hey.
I couldn't.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Sammy.
Sammy.
Come on.
Sammy.
- Hey.
- Hey.
How you doing?
You came to check on me.
Come on.
I need a drink.
You all right?
Have you, um...
Heard the news at all lately?
Do you that they kicked that guy in the Moretta case?
Yeah, man.
I guess when it rains, it pours.
You heard a patrol cop killed a pedestrian in the 77th?
High-speed chase.
She just walked into traffic.
Yeah, I heard that.
And now I'm about to lose my job for leaking photos of a dead celebrity.
All these years of being a good cop, and that's my Google hit.
Lydia.
No, it's gonna happen, Russ.
I can feel it.
Just all the rage I feel, you know?
Just I'm up all night.
Who could do this?
Not just to me, but to us.
I did.
Come on, Russ.
It's not funny.
I, uh, gave them a couple photos, and they paid me half a million bucks.
What, was I gonna be a secretary the rest of my life?
Scrape by on disability, if they even gave it to me?
It, Lyd.
I saw my chance, so I took it.
If I had known that the photos were from your phone,
I wouldn't have done it.
I just told Fernandez an hour ago, got my ass reamed by the chief.
Took them all of a minute to fire me.
At least it hurts a lot less with cash in the bank.
You did it for the money?
No.
No.
No!
I wouldn't -- it looked like that asshole actor chopped his girlfriend's head off.
I mean, especially celebrities -- they have those lawyers and those fancy handlers, and...
You know, the public has to know when vicious shit like that goes down.
He was innocent.
He shot himself.
I know.
I couldn't have predicted that.
But the bottom line is...
I'm sorry.
I know you went through a lot for that and it messed you up.
And I wish --
I should've told you sooner.
That was wrong.
I don't even know you.
Lydia.
I don't even know you, dude.
Lydia, please.
Come on.
Lydia!

Man:
Suspect just turned, westbound on Selma from Cahuenga.
[ Siren wailing ] Man #2:
Air-3, what's the speed of the suspect's vehicle, and what are the conditions?
No, no, no, do not call off this [bleep] chase!
Clear!
70, 75.
Traffic's moderate, non-residential.
A43, show us as a secondary unit in pursuit.
Approaching a no-fly zone.
Got to back off.
- Primary unit, you have it.
- We got this [bleep]
[ Tires screech ] Clear.
We're clear.
A35, suspect heading northbound now -
- Schrader.
We got this son of a bitch.
[ Wailing continues ]
Clear!
Dewey!
Even when cops do everything right, things can still go sideways.
Learning to accept this is a big part of the job.
Russell:
Hold on, hold on.
You of all people, will you please pull over?
Oh, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
No.
It gets better.
"Exactly how the grisly photos of the pop star's headless body
"got leaked to TMZ remains a mystery.
"But secret sources tell us they were snapped
"with Detective Adams' cellphone.
"Doesn't take a genius.
Might be time for her to start scanning the want ads."
Who reads this shit anyway?
Are you kidding me?
It's L.A. who doesn't?
Well, at least the department doesn't care.
Hey, aren't you on your way to a homicide?
Yeah, and the dead guy will probably have one of these in his pocket.
What happened to Lydia the optimist?
She got her ass handed to her by Lydia the suspect.
You think Fernandez is gonna fight for me with I.A. breathing down her neck?
Well, look, I mean, you answered their questions.
Okay, you showed them your bank accounts.
There's no proof that you got paid.
I mean, lots of people had access to the murder book where you put the photos.
So there's no proof that you leaked them.
I mean...
It's gonna be okay.
[ Sighs ] Yeah.
Maybe you're right.
Petey, come on, breakfast!
Tommy, no banging.
Petey:
I can't find my shoes.
Uh, that's because it's in the fireplace.
We -- we were just horsing around.
God, it doesn't stop.
I guess these two are gonna fix the fence and maybe the sprinklers.
Everybody wants to help out.
[ Men speaking Spanish on TV ]
You promised me to my face at the last community meeting that you'd get that thing hauled away.
[ Speaks Spanish ]
But still one month later, my kids got to watch guys pissing in the alley and strawberries turning tricks.
The city told me that they were gonna take care of that.
More cops.
Just like clockwork.
You gonna pass the buck, too?
'Cause he just keeps on telling me, and somehow, that thing's still here.
I like this lady, but she's starting to get on my nerves.
Still, sucks that her kids got to see this.
You know what sucks is we get the gun, the big stick, and they think we have all the power.
Then when they realize we don't, they get all mouthy with us.
That's what sucks.
- Hey, how you doing?
- Good.
What's up?
Good.
Yeah.
Hang on a second.
You guys raided this house and this trailer about two months ago, right?
Yeah. 40k of rock, all in a day's work.
Excuse me.
This -- this house, it's slated for demo, isn't it?
Yeah, that's the word.
- That's the word.
- So what's up with the trailer?
You guys having trouble getting that cleared?
It's not our call, man.
We're still waiting on paperwork.
Till then, it's private property.
Oh, private property.
So you guys got yourselves a warrant, then, right?
You mind if I take a look at that?
See, here's my problem, fellas.
You got yourself a little felony bus stop here.
Anytime you need a felony bust, you just drive on by.
Well, like you, we don't make the laws, remember?
Excuse us.
We're done, huh?
What the hell, Sal?
A double murder on Vermont, and you give it to Faloona and Mills?
- I'm next in the rotation.
- I took you out.
Why?
Because some B.S.S. asshole doesn't want me riding alone?
Sammy -- you're listening to these people?
The shrink I talked to for 10 minutes, he doesn't know shit about being a cop.
Sit down.
He probably hasn't been south of the 10.
Look, Sammy.
Some git cops came in last night and brought in a suspect in Nate's murder.
Shit.
S-so, did they raid the guy's place?
They did but came up with nothing.
Nothing?
No blood?
Nothing on his clothes?
Lab's still checking, all right, but it doesn't look good.
Look, all they really got is a snitch who'll swear the guy did it, and he's a base-head.
Not much of a witness, you know?
Well, when can I I.D. him?
They're putting together a six-pack, so it's just gonna take an extra beat.
Sammy, we got to make this thing squeaky clean.
You understand?
Hey, the varsity team.
- Hey.
- Hey.
All right, so far we got 10 shell casings --
.22s and .38s.
Josie:
And this guy was the target?
No, doesn't look to be.
I got a witness over there who says that these two assholes went after each other.
Bang, bang, bang.
They get away.
And this poor guy gets caught in the crossfire.
Wedding band, no tats.
I hate these.
You get a statement from him?
Yeah, started to, but then you guys came.
His name's Henry Watts.
You want to talk?
Yeah.
You take the body?
Yeah, sure.
Hey, Mr. Watts, how you doing?
I'm Detective Adams.
Hi.
Good to meet you.
You sure you're okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
It's just when the shooting started,
I dove between two cars.
Guess I just...
banged my head.
You should let the paramedics check you out.
You could have a concussion.
I'd be surprised if that were true.
I'm told I'm very hardheaded.
So, what exactly happened?
Uh, well, I came out of there with some groceries, saw two guys arguing.
Next thing I know, they're pulling out guns.
I mean, it was nuts.
They started shooting at each other from like 10 feet apart.
That poor guy there was just trying to get out of the way.
You think you could I.D. the guys?
I certainly could try.
Uh, hey, guys, can you come over here for a sec?
Um, let them check you out, okay?
Yeah.
Okay, okay.
Maybe they should.
Munoz:
Hey, Adams.
We think you're a lot hotter in person, if you don't mind us saying.
Munoz, come on, isn't there something else you could be doing, like traffic control maybe?
Oh!
Lydia, we don't think you did it.
Let's go.
Hey.
What's going on?
This man doesn't have a concussion.
He has a bullet in his head.
No, Ma'am...wh...
When I spoke to you guys last month you told me that the house and the trailer were both gonna be cleared -- ma'am --
Okay.
Well, you got my number.
Thanks.
And we wonder why people go postal.
Great.
Now this.
[ Indistinct shouting ]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[ Indistinct shouting ]
All right!
Stop it right now!
Stop it!
What are you doing in front of these kids, huh?
What are we teaching them?
Share and share alike.
They don't got that in Armenia?
- I'm Turkish.
- I'm from Jordan.
That's fine!
You work it out.
Just switch off days or something.
You guys can do that, right?
Fine.
I'll take the weekends.
[bleep][bleep] You stupid terrorist!
Terrorist?
!
Yeah.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
Ben:
All right, all right, all right, all right.
Hook him up.
Hook him up.
He's selling guns to kids.
Look.
And I'm the terrorist?
You know what?
I need sugar.
You?
Hey, everybody!
It's your lucky day!
Free ice cream, courtesy of the Los Angeles Police Department.
There you go, buddy.
Have a bomb pop.
And furthermore, the investigating officers are deliberately not present, nor have their identities been made known to Detective Bryant.
Taking every precaution, this six-pack I.D.
Will be handled by Detective Olati Johnson of the domestic violence table.
She has no knowledge of the case.
Olati?
The photos you're about to see may or may not contain the person responsible for Nate Moretta's murder.
If you understand this and the rest of the admonitions, please sign here.
Do you see anyone you recognize?
Take your time, Sammy.
Excuse me.
You all right?
I saw his face, Sal.
I just...
I just needed some air.
All right.
That's cool.
Just take a little breather, then.
We'll go back in, all right?
Tomorrow.
I need a day.
Sammy, you're not sure, are you?
I just said I saw him.
I just...
It's just harder than I expected.
Sammy, this guy has an attorney breathing down my neck.
Without an I.D., we might have to kick him.
Can't we just stall?
We do it all the time for shit that doesn't even matter.
Come on, Sal.
What's the big deal?
[ Sighs ]
All right.
I'll do what I can, all right?
I need you to focus.
We need this, Sammy, all right?
Yeah.
John:
We went lights and sirens for this?
Dude, are you kidding me, man?
I had to get you here before the coroner moved the body.
Check this out.
You know how they always say TV kills brain cells?
Voilà.
You got to be shitting me.
[ Laughs ] Ben:
What the hell happened?
Let me clue you in, Sherlock.
Pussy Galore over there said that he liked to do it while watching porn.
He also liked the bottom.
So he mounted the TV up there, pulled it out over the top of them, but I guess he wasn't too handy, because he used the wrong screws.
Where was she when this happened?
She said it missed her head by an inch.
I always say, blow jobs can save lives.
[ Laughs ]
Lydia:
Hey.
How you doing?
For a guy with a .22 slug in his head?
I guess the answer's...good.
They said if you're feeling up to it that we can ask you a couple questions.
That'll distract me.
Please, shoot.
I mean...
[ Imitates gunshot ]
You're an artist?
Uh, computer graphics mostly.
Got to eat.
But every now and then, I go old school.
Nothing like a pencil and pad.
This what you want to know?
Wow.
That's amazing.
So the guys were black?
Light-skinned, yeah.
One of them had a tattoo.
I couldn't see it clearly.
And they were dressed like this?
Wife-beaters and bling?
Yeah.
One of them wore an Angels cap.
This is amazing.
Did either of them have a car?
Not that I saw.
[ Knock on door ]
Hey.
Hi.
Um, doc wants to see us a sec.
Okay.
I think we're about to get the "leave him alone and let him rest" speech.
Ah, before neurosurgery?
Probably smart.
Is there anyone I can call for you?
Oh, my fiancée's in Rome for work.
I called her.
She'll be on her way back soon.
Good.
I'll be back in a bit.
I'd get what you need from him as soon as possible.
Yeah, I was kind of trying to do that.
He doesn't have long, okay?
I'm just giving you the heads-up.
What?
The bullet entered the skull and settled posterior of the optic chiasm.
He's got increasing intracranial pressure.
In English.
The thing is small and really deep in his brain.
Any operation to remove it will most likely kill him.
But he's -- he's -- he's talking.
He seems fine.
That's not gonna last.
Well, are you gonna tell him?
Not yet.
We're waiting on Keith Black, the top guy at Cedars, to take a look at his scans.
Maybe he'll have a different take, but I doubt it.
[ Pager beeping ] Sorry.
I got to go.
Um, Fernandez wants us back now.
Of course she does.
It's not just you, okay?
You, those R.H.D. guys, and the six patrol officers that were first on the scene are now suspended from duty.
You've been assigned home pending an internal investigation.
Josie:
Are we getting paid?
Are we getting paid?
Yeah, with all benefits.
That's good with me, 'cause I didn't nada.
I'm just gonna get caught up on my Internet shopping.
Am I supposed to just sit home and do nothing?
"Assigned home" means that during working hours, you are to stay at home.
Well, are you gonna put an ankle bracelet on me?
'Cause if not, I'm gonna do as I please.
You have my cellphone number.
You can reach me.
Oh, no.
You took my cellphone.
I'm gonna have to note that on the file.
Oh, I'm really worried now.
What's up?
Sal:
Pulled a traffic warrant on him.
It's bullshit, but it'll hold him till tomorrow.
His attorney saw the video of your six-pack I.D.
Now he's demanding that I do a lineup with his client in it.
Good.
Better than looking at mug shots, you know?
The asshole's standing right in front of me.
Yeah.
Get a good night's sleep, all right?
The lineup's tomorrow, 0900.
[ Sighs ]
So...
The doctor read you the riot act?
Yes, but I charmed her.
Oh.
The nurses brought me some art supplies up from the kids' ward.
Figure as long as I can draw, right, how bad can it be?
Definitely, yeah.
Everybody seems really optimistic.
They got this famous neurosurgeon coming in to review my CAT scan.
Then they're gonna settle on what to do.
The surgery's tricky, obviously.
They just want to do their homework.
Look, Mr. Watts --
Henry.
Henry.
About the case --
Oh, yeah, I remembered -- the guy in the hat yelled the other guy's name.
Leon, Dion, something like that.
No, I needed to tell you I'm no longer on the case.
There will be two new detectives, and they'll be coming around soon.
Oh.
I see.
You're that Detective Adams.
Lydia, I guess.
Yes.
My fame precedes me.
I saw it on TV.
On an endless loop.
So, did you leak the photos?
No.
I believe you.
Thanks.
I appreciate it.
So, I guess you're gonna be going, now that you're off the case?
I'm gonna stay a bit and brief the detectives when they get here.
Might as well.
Avoid the paparazzi?
Hmm.
That too.
Yeah.
And listen, um...
In case I go into surgery before Jessie, my fiancée, gets here, could you, um...
Could you let her know our dogs are with the neighbors?
Or could you get the detectives to tell her?
Sure, sure, sure.
I will make sure she gets the message.
I'm feeling...
kind of tired.
Gonna try and catch a nap.
Okay.
I'll check in in a bit.
Yeah.
[ Sighs ]
I've called three times today.
I've spoken to five different clerks.
Dewey:
Sure as shit, the windows are blacked out.
I know you keep saying that, but I need to know when.
Banging around on the inside.
So finally I get the door pried open, and -- bwah!
-- this frickin' vulture comes flying out with an ear hanging in its beak.
I look inside, and the guy just blew his head off with a 12 gauge.
How'd the bird get in there?
It got in through the hole in the roof that the gun made, man.
It scared the shit out of me.
Shit.
Chickie:
Shit, beats the hell out of mine.
Just some poor old guy, ass up in the air, next to the toilet.
Blah, blah, blah.
That's a dime a dozen, man.
The extra pressure caused a heart attack.
I heard it a million times.
Speaking of shotguns, you heard this one?
So, Koreatown, one of those rooms you rent by the hour.
- How much you pay for that?
- Hey, relax.
We find this dead guy, right?
He's completely naked, chest blown out, lying on a bed, shards of mirror sticking out of his stomach, his neck, his face.
I got this.
I got this.
He's laying on the bed next to his shotty, right?
He killed himself with his legs up in the air.
He's got a pencil through his toes crossed through the trigger guard.
He pulls the trigger with his feet.
The recoil of the gun kicks it up into the ceiling, smashing the mirror.
Am I close?
Huh?
[ Laughs ] I heard that one, man.
You're gonna have to try a little bit harder, hello?
But I'll still buy your dirty ass lunch.
What?
Shit.
She just hung up on me.
Why do you even care, man?
I find it novel, Dewey, every once in a while to give a shit.
You know, when you called me and said you were at the hospital,
I thought you'd gone 51/50 on me.
Trust me, I am this close.
Nozick and Chavez?
Left them three voicemails, and neither one of them will call me back.
Yeah, they're working a stabbing in Lynwood, probably got their hands full.
Yeah, but this is priority.
The witness may not last.
It's not your case now.
Why are you making it harder for yourself?
'Cause it's not just about me, and I don't want to see them screw this up.
Fernandez told the cap that you weren't gonna go home.
And I thought her head was gonna explode, you know?
So she sent you here to convince me?
Well, her language was a bit stronger.
Yeah, well, snap a picture and leak her a photo of this.
Thought you might feel that way.
I cannot believe this is happening, Russ.
All my hard work, my rep.
It's all going to crap now.
Leak cases are hard to prove.
Once the dog-and-pony show's over, everything will settle down.
So you just got to wait it out.
If you're wrong, will you at least be my lead rep?
Go through all of this with me?
Don't they assign guys to do that from the league?
Yeah, but I don't trust anybody else.
No, I-I don't have any experience.
Yeah, but you've got my back.
Of course.
[ Chuckles ] Okay.
It's late.
Yeah, just about done here.
You been coming around a lot.
You know, doing what I can.
Just trying to help her out, you know?
That all you want to do, help her?
What'd you say?
You heard what I said.
You accuse me of trying to move in on the widow?
You're the one living in her house, asshole.
You don't know shit about what's going on, so I suggest you keep your mouth shut.
I know you sleep here now, don't you?
Doesn't take a genius to figure out what that means.
Nate was my partner.
I'm looking after his family the way he would've wanted.
Yeah?
You got that?
Yeah.
Is that clear to you?
Yeah.
Get the [bleep] Out of here.
You know what?
You need to get some help.
Do I?
Yeah.
See ya.
Yeah.
[ Sighs ]
Shit.
It's called trephination, or burr holes, to relieve the pressure.
Henry:
Okay, but if you're gonna drill in my head, why not just dig the bullet out?
You're still bleeding, Mr. Watts.
This has to happen now.
Then we can pursue our options.
- Like what?
- Dr. Bernheimer will be talking to you.
No.
Why can't you tell me?
And what about the guy at Cedars?
We're all still reviewing things.
Please lie back.
All asleep.
Pretty amazing, actually.
You're good with kids, Sammy.
I don't know about that.
I think they just sense that I'm one of them.
You went at Stiles pretty good back there.
Oh.
I thought you were gonna deck him.
That -
- I'm sorry.
I'm an idiot.
No.
I'm sure you're just stressed about the lineup tomorrow.
Everyone's talking about it, how it's all up to you.
Well, if I recognize him --
I mean, if it's the guy, I'll recognize him.
And...
If I do, we'll take him down.
I promise.
What are we doing, Sammy?
Hey, buddy.
I'm thirsty.
Okay, baby, I'll get you water.
So, you're gonna be my dad now?
Okay.
Come on.
Let's go inside.
[ Birds chirping ]
Hey.
If you want me to come back, I can.
Come in.
Come in.
They, um -- they tell you about...
I got...
Two new holes...
In my head.
Ease the pressure, I guess.
Beyond that, I don't know.
Seems like no one wants to operate.
Or no one knows how.
You heard about Jessica?
Uh, no, just, um, she's on her way.
Yeah, I know.
You know what she does for a living?
Writes children's books.
Really good ones about a lizard named Fig.
- You have any kids?
- No.
Then you probably never heard of a lizard named Fig.
It's really good.
It's how we met.
I did the illustrations for her second book.
And we just...
Fell in love.
Just jumped right into it.
Still can't believe how lucky I got.
What would you do...
If you were me?
Would you go under the knife for the 1% chance at living, or would you try to hold out for a chance to say goodbye?
Oh, I don't --
I --
I was in love once.
Yeah?
Yeah, it was my second training officer when I just joined the force, and...
He was married with kids, and when he decided to leave his wife...
Things got ugly real fast.
What happened?
We figured it out.
We figured out a way to be together.
And then he was killed on the job.
A shootout at an auto-parts store.
It was senseless, but...
But I had been reassigned.
So I wasn't there to say goodbye.
And that...
If you love her...
Hold out.
That'd be my answer.
I'm gonna let you get some rest, okay?
Don't -- don't.
Please.
Jacoby:
This was set for 9:00.
It's now going on 11:00.
I don't work here, sir.
You're gonna have to take that up with the sheriff's department.
And don't think I don't know the irregularities with my client's traffic warrant were a direct result of your stalling.
I'm just a cop, counselor.
Fewer words would be good.
Now, if you could just stand the [bleep] over there, please?
Thank you.
So, we good to go?
Sal:
Sammy?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Detective Bryant, do you recognize any of the individuals standing before you?
Right before he hit Nate, he said, "toma [bleep] puto."
Could I have number 2, 3 repeat that for me?
Number 2, take one step forward and say, "toma [bleep] puto."
Toma [bleep] puto.
Step back.
Okay, now number 3.
Toma [bleep] puto.
S-- can 6 take his hand out of his pocket?
Number 6, take your hand out of your pocket.
3.
Number 3.
You're saying you recognize number 3?
It's number 3.
Okay, we're done.
Number 2.
Number 2.
I meant number 2.
It's number 2.
Okay?
Let's go.
Number 2 is an inmate here, Sammy.
He got extra food for standing in the lineup.
John:
That's -- that's just great.
Terrific.
Thank you.
No.
Yeah.
Okay, you too.
Well, good news.
Some desk jockey just forgot to sign a form.
So they moved the crack trailer this morning.
Ben:
All right.
So now we're going to double-check.
You trust anything the city tells you?
No.
Chickie:
Geez, that sucks.
Okay, bye.
Nate Moretta -- that cop who got murdered?
Yeah.
His partner picked the wrong guy in a lineup.
Ouch!
Notify the suicide hotline.
Dewey.
I'm just saying, man.
You know how it is.
They're gonna be watching his ass.
Dispatcher:
All units and A35, 211 in progress, 1620 Fuega.
Light them up.
[ Siren wailing ]
[ Tires screech ]
Freeze!
Drop the knife!
Drop it!
Follow me in the car!
[ Tires screech ]
[ Siren wailing ]
Stop!
Stop right now!
That's it.
Thank you. [ Speaks Spanish ] I'm gonna borrow this.
Hey, jag-off.
Not rampart?
You're learning.
Give me a hand.
Muchachos...
Venga ayudarnos, por favor.
Chickie:
Stop!
[ Siren wailing ]
[ Tires screech ] He's getting in a car.
Right behind you, partner.
Gold Ford.
License plate -
- Victor-4-7.
Go!
Gracias, amigo.
Gracias.
Yeah.
Yeah, this is John Cooper with the Los Angeles Police Department.
Yeah, how you doing?
I got an abandoned vehicle blocking the alley behind 226 Vernon.
Yeah.
All right, I appreciate it.
Chickie:
A35, we're in pursuit of a gold Ford Contour, now westbound on Florence at Brighton.
A43, show us en route to back.
Man:
Suspect just turned, westbound on Selma from Cahuenga.
Man #2:
Air-3, what's the speed of the suspect's vehicle, and what are the conditions?
No, no, no, do not call off this [bleep] chase!
Clear!
70, 75.
Traffic's moderate, non-residential.
A43, show us as a secondary unit in pursuit.
Approaching a no-fly zone.
Got to back off.
Primary unit, you have it.
We got this [bleep]
[ Tires screech ] Clear.
We're clear.
A35, suspect heading northbound now -
- Schrader.
We got this son of a bitch.
[ Wailing continues ]
Clear!
Dewey!
[ Tires screech ]
Damn!
God damn.
Damn it.
We got to keep going.
Jesus.
Woman down.
She just came out of nowhere!
Shit!
[ Horn honks ]
[ Siren wailing ]
[ Tires screech ]
Hey!
Freeze!
Let me see your hands now!
Get your hands up!
Get your hands out of the car!
Put your hands up!
Let's go!
Hands up now!
A43, show us code 6, corner of Yucca and Argyle.
Does she have a pulse?
Oh, God.
Oh, God!
[bleep]
God damn it!
One, two...
John:
You got him?
Yeah, I got him, I got him, I got him.
All right, we got two pinned.
You okay, ma'am?
Somebody's coming, ma'am.
Woman:
No, I can't move my legs!
Okay.
It's okay.
19, 20... 21, 22, 23, 24.
Come on, come on.
It's over.
It's over, man.
It's over.
She's dead.
[ Breathing heavily ]
[ Groans ] Eggs.
Can I get you something?
I forgot them at the store.
How could you forget that?
Weren't they on your list?
Yeah.
Yeah, but...
Jessica:
Henry.
Jessica.
God, baby.
How do you feel?
Jess.
When are you having surgery?
What's -- uh...
Oh, I told them I was gonna wait for you to get here.
So...
Dewey told me already, John.
All part of God's plan.
Don't make me tell you to [bleep] off, too.
Look, what happened was tragic, all right?
But we did what we were supposed to.
We lost air support.
We were primary.
It was my responsibility.
I could have called it off.
She stepped right in front of you.
There were sirens, lights flashing.
You know the funniest part?
I wasn't gonna be a cop.
I was just gonna surf.
I don't know.
Bartend.
But then getting pregnant, my marriage blowing up.
I had a kid.
I needed a job.
That was all this was supposed to be.
How many surfers run toward gunfire?
Hmm?
How many?
Teachers, bartenders -- they just jump in their car and go after these assholes?
No.
No, and until they do, you cut yourself a break.
I-I got to go pick up Tristan.
If not you, who?
Who, Chickie?
Who deserves to be wearing that uniform?
Nurse:
Um, Detective?
She was right there with him when he died.
I knew you'd want to know.
Thanks.
And, Detective...
I couldn't help hearing what you said to him.
It was...
It was beautiful.
I'm just sorry that you had to go through that.
I just made that up, actually.
Just wanted to give him strength, you know?
Really?
It felt so honest and heartfelt and...
Cops -- good storytellers.
[ Sighs ]
We agreed that you would not come here.
I got no place to go.
[ Scoffs ]
Well, you can't stay here.
Jesus!
Wh--
What is it?
I [bleep] up.
Everything I touch...
Everything just turns to shit.
Everything.
W-- what -- what did you do?
It's what I didn't -- it's what I couldn't --
it's what I couldn't do.
Hey, hey.
I couldn't.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Sammy.
Sammy.
[ Sobbing ]
Come on.
Sammy.
[ Brakes squeal ]
- Hey.
- Hey.
How you doing?
You came to check on me.
Come on.
I need a drink.
You all right?
Have you, um...
Heard the news at all lately?
Do you that they kicked that guy in the Moretta case?
[ Scoffs ] Yeah, man.
I guess when it rains, it pours.
You heard a patrol cop killed a pedestrian in the 77th?
High-speed chase.
She just walked into traffic.
Yeah, I heard that.
And now I'm about to lose my job for leaking photos of a dead celebrity.
All these years of being a good cop, and that's my Google hit.
Lydia.
No, it's gonna happen, Russ.
I can feel it.
Just all the rage I feel, you know?
Just I'm up all night.
Who could do this?
Not just to me, but to us.
I did.
Come on, Russ.
It's not funny.
I, uh, gave them a couple photos, and they paid me half a million bucks.
What, was I gonna be a secretary the rest of my life?
Scrape by on disability, if they even gave it to me?
[bleep] It, Lyd.
I saw my chance, so I took it.
If I had known that the photos were from your phone,
I wouldn't have done it.
I just told Fernandez an hour ago, got my ass reamed by the chief.
Took them all of a minute to fire me.
At least it hurts a lot less with cash in the bank.
You did it for the money?
No.
No.
No!
I wouldn't -- it looked like that asshole actor chopped his girlfriend's head off.
I mean, especially celebrities -- they have those lawyers and those fancy handlers, and...
You know, the public has to know when vicious shit like that goes down.
He was innocent.
He shot himself.
I know.
I couldn't have predicted that.
[ Chuckles ]
But the bottom line is...
I'm sorry.
I know you went through a lot for that and it messed you up.
And I wish --
I should've told you sooner.
That was wrong.
I don't even know you.
Lydia.
I don't even know you, dude.
Lydia, please.
Come on.
Lydia!
[ Door slams ]
Step aside, Major.
We'd all understand if you pulled that trigger.
But the lives of thousands of people are at stake.
Secure him.
Dress his wound.
John Porter, confess to the crime...
Blood.
Sit forward.
Enjoy your stay at the organ farm?
Actually, I thought the food was shit, so I discharged myself.
We're secure.
Careful.
He's clean.
Sergeant Richmond.
All your training to do this.
Woman's work.
Are we the transport as well?
Sergeant, we have a hit.
Target two, purchasing train ticket.
Where?
Big screen.
Kobánya Station, southeast suburb.
Satellite lock-on Kobánya.
Target's carrying a case.
Right, he's on the train.
Where is it going?
Arrives Nyugati main station in 12 minutes.
If there is a bomb in that case, he'll need a trigger mechanism.
Something like a cell phone.
Remember, we're dealing with VX.
You will shoot to kill.
- Copy that.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Is it just me?
- What?
Sinclair.
You gotta wonder about a guy who's gonna step between a bullet and Latif.
General Ramiz's announcement is expected to be welcomed by western leaders attending the world Security Summit in Budapest.
The stability of Pakistan, which has nuclear weapons, is high in the summit's agenda.
For us there, Jessica, what's the latest?
I report to you live from outside Buda Palace, as behind me, more of the delegates from the world's most powerful countries arrive to discuss security issues in the Middle East and elsewhere.
Now, although confidential we suspect that Pakistan will be high up there on the agenda, along with the staggered withdrawal of Western troops from Afghanistan.
Now, as you can see, a large crowd has formed...
Anything on the other target?
Nothing yet.
Whatever transport he's using is coming in under the radar.
And all the main delegates, they understand the need for absolute secrecy?
Yes, sir.
A discreet meeting room has been arranged
- just as you requested.
- Good.
About time, Colonel.
Recognise it?
Should I be invoking my human rights?
Well, for that you need to be human.
Terrorising a peaceful city makes you something else.
How does a civilised, intelligent man become what you are?
You know better than anyone, Colonel.
How many deaths have you sanctioned?
Hmm.
As you can see, we're tracking your bomber.
We have face recognition software on every CCTV camera in the city.
Impressive.
He will be caught and he will be neutralised.
But if you thought there was only one, you would have killed me already.
Target has disembarked.
We have visual.
Suspect getting off train at Nyugati Station.
Yeah, copy that.
We're approaching the station now.
See anything?
Got no visual.
Repeat, no visual.
Found him.
Target's boarding a westbound subway.
It's rush hour.
If he detonates down there, he could kill tens of thousands.
He's heading under the river.
You need to intercept further down the line.
Copy that.
- We have you on visual.
- Target still on train.
Next stop, Batthyány tér.
You're thinking about Delhi, aren't you?
When we shook hands.
When we shook hands.
And you gave me Mahmood.
You must long for that moment again.
It would have saved her life.
She had forfeited her life.
And what about Sergeant John Porter?
Captain Kate Marshall?
Are they just pawns in your game?
Pawns that you pushed into the centre of the board.
This will end today.
Finally, something we can agree on.
Target's off.
Batthyány Station.
Yeah, copy that, we're en route.
He's going down.
Go.
I think I got a visual on target.
Looks like he's coming up the riverside exit.
Target visual.
In pursuit.
If you get a headshot, take it.
Negative.
I got no clear shot.
It's a fucking sardine can in here.
Where's that tram heading?
Due south.
Towards the palace.
Moving closer.
I might have a chance.
Excuse me.
Coming through.
Excuse me.
Hey, hey, hey.
Shh.
Calm down.
Calm down.
Fuck off.
Fuck off.
Fuck off.
Move!
Move!
Move!
Get the fuck back!
Get the fuck out of my way!
He's got a phone!
Drop it!
Drop it!
Move, move, move.
Lay down!
Move!
Move!
Get off!
Give me the fucking phone!
- What's happening?
- Fuck!
Get out!
- Scott, Stonebridge, report.
- Fuck.
- I think he's armed it.
Fuck!
- Oh, shit.
Get the fuck up!
Fucker, stay there!
Stay there.
Everyone get off the tram!
Now!
I'm opening the briefcase.
How you doing, Michael?
Careful, Michael.
- It's fucking empty!
- Where's the fucking bomb?
Where's the fucking...
Where's the bomb?
Tell me!
Where's the fucking bomb?
Huh?
Where is it?
Where is it?
What the fuck is that?
What?
Jesus.
The bomb's in him.
Get off the train!
STONEBRIDGE!
Get the doors, move!
Move away!
Move back!
Move!
Everybody get back!
Now!
Move!
Shit!
Back up!
Back the fuck up!
- Scott!
Scott!
- Everyone back!
- Lady, back!
Back!
- Get away from the tram!
Get away from here!
Scott, report.
Yeah, the police are gonna need decontamination units,
Hazmat suits, the works.
Is he using the VX?
Yeah.
It's nasty shit.
And you're okay?
Yeah.
Thanks for asking.
The explosion was contained within the tram.
No civilian casualties that I know of.
That shit is leaking out.
Hey, back up.
Back up.
- Are you at a safe distance?
- Affirmative.
We're upwind.
This entire area needs to be sealed off.
All right, Mike.
Looks like the cavalry's here.
Let's go.
Scott, can you confirm how the device was detonated?
You really want to know?
It was inside the son of a bitch.
Alert the Hungarians.
Let them know what we're dealing with.
- Got it.
- There's no keeping a lid on this now.
We need to find that other bomber, and fucking quick.
Colonel.
The bomber triggered a device on board a tram.
Scott and Stonebridge managed to get everyone clear and contain most of the blast.
The device was carried inside the bomber's body.
It's been a potential terrorist M.O. For a while now.
A bomb in a cavity created by the removal of the spleen.
It seems Major Sinclair appreciates the measure of my achievement.
- It's an obscenity.
- Then it is just one of many.
- Thank you, Major.
- Colonel.
We'vejust received a report that there's been a large explosion in the city.
Now, we're all the way up here at the Buda Palace, and we heard a really loud bang.
There is still no indication as to what has caused that explosion.
But as you can see behind me, the riot police have been drafted in.
And they were quite calm, but now they are starting to get very, very anxious indeed.
Exposing innocent people to this poison is meaningless slaughter.
I'm not a nihilist, Colonel.
Everything I do has a purpose.
And what is that purpose?
If word of my presence here gets out, our enemies at home will undermine my presidential campaign.
And with it, our chances for peace.
Yes?
- I'm sorry, sir, we have to turn around.
- Why?
We've been given a new location.
Well, what is happening?
Some incident at the summit.
Incident?
No, please...
So what are you hoping to achieve?
Becoming the poster boy for Islamist jihad?
- A new bin Laden?
- Oh, please.
You insult me by comparing me to these religious fanatics.
- Oh, and you're not?
- I'm a pragmatist.
- A Pakistani patriot.
- You disgrace your country.
I honour my country, as I always have.
I have no regrets.
Can you say the same?
I'm not going to let this happen.
My will is greater than yours.
Then you know nothing of my will.
Mr Laszlo, this is Major Sinclair.
Come on, guys.
What the fuck are we waiting for?
Return to base.
Still awaiting intel on the second target.
That was not our intention.
...running scans on every subway station...
Mr Laszlo, Colonel Grant cannot come to the phone.
Tell me.
Have you told Sergeant Scott that you framed him?
Does he know of your role in Trojan Horse?
We understand that an order has been given to evacuate all of the world leaders.
What's more worrying is that the entire area surrounding the explosion has been sealed off, and Hazmat decontamination teams have been called to the site.
Emergency services are asking people to stay inside, to close their doors and...
We intercepted a local police radio call.
Mmm-hmm?
A VIP convoy was ambushed en route from the airport.
Ambushed?
Strange.
I thought all the leaders had arrived.
- They have.
- So who's this?
- Lost power on bank one.
- Lost comms.
Everybody down!
- Shit, you okay?
- Give me my gun.
- Julia, look, you're injured...
- I'm not dying without my fucking gun!
One, two, three.
Fuck!
Clear!
Fuck.
Sinclair, Richmond, you all right?
Here.
Julia, you all right?
What happened?
Colonel.
Colonel!
They've gone.
Oh, shit.
Thank you.
- How the fuck did they find us?
- I don't know.
You don't know?
How convenient.
Enough!
I haven't betrayed anyone.
I haven't compromised anyone.
So if you want to beat some kind of confession out of me, you're gonna have to wait until there are no more terrorists running around the city with chemical bombs stitched inside their fucking bodies.
Fine.
Good.
What have we got?
Well, the mainframe's fucked.
With a laptop, we should be able to hook up to London.
Let me help you.
The first terrorist only tried to detonate when he was confronted.
If it was just about killing people, he would have done it on the subway.
Laszlo.
That train was headed towards the palace.
Major Sinclair, I demand to speak with your superior right now.
She's not here.
As you can see, our unit came under attack.
Your unit has no mandate or authorisation...
With respect, we have already stopped one suicide bomber in this town.
We saved the lives of God knows how many people.
We think there's another.
And he's on his way to the palace.
So please, either help us, or get out of our way.
- Is this your suspect?
- Yes, sir.
Do you think you can recognise this man in a crowd?
Yes, I could.
Is struggling, but his condition is critical.
My officers will escort you back to the palace.
We'll have tactical support.
Thank you.
Major, what about the Colonel?
The terrorist threat first.
Besides, we have no idea where she is.
We do if she's with Latif.
- How?
- I put a tracker in his dressing.
Nice work.
Just getting a signal now.
Tura, 38 kilometres from here.
Okay.
Michael, you take the bomber.
Scott, you take the Colonel.
What the hell happened here?
Carnage.
By the way, Sinclair, you hit like a girl.
I don't know.
He kind of hit you pretty good, didn't he?
Fucking hurt, but don't tell him.
- Let's go.
- Yeah.
- Bring her back.
- Shall do, buddy.
So what can you tell me about this man right here?
- Thank you.
- We know that he's Chechen.
But we have no name, no date of birth.
Major, I'm sorry to interrupt.
Just before she was killed, Sally intercepted a communication between Hungarian security and Pakistani intelligence.
It refers to the VIP convoy that was ambushed.
The car that was ambushed.
He was in it.
General Akmal Ramiz.
Akmal.
The Pakistani presidential candidate?
And our best hope for peace in Pakistan.
Latif.
Your invitation to the summit was not as secret as you thought, General.
You have John Allen to thank.
You endanger the lives of thousands with chemical weapons for one man.
As ever, Colonel, you see things so one-dimensionally.
General Ramiz is a liar and a charlatan.
But this is not a mere abduction.
You are witness to a moment in history.
And I'm honoured to have such distinguished guests.
As the two principal architects of Operation Trojan Horse.
Trojan Horse was only ever supposed to be an intelligence operation.
Falsifying evidence of WMDs in Iraq made the case for war.
But the road to hell is paved with good intentions, isn't that right, Colonel?
Intelligence wasn't enough.
Which is where ATAT and the Pakistani military proved so helpful.
So the weapons were made and transported to be placed inside Iraq.
Sergeant, the comms are back on.
- Thank you.
- Sir.
Scott, what's your position?
- ETA in 10.
- Copy that.
Trojan Horse was necessary at the time.
We had to justify the action of our
Western allies to our own people.
This is ancient history.
But its relics survive.
It is those relics that I have sought and obtained.
The very cache of VX that you intended to plant inside Iraq.
They were supposed to be destroyed.
The temptation to keep them was too strong.
However, ATAT didn't hide them well enough.
So today, I deployed them.
While the future of my nation is casually sealed over lunch by foreign imperialists,
and you grovel at their feet.
I came here to save Pakistan.
You want a craven Pakistan.
A Pakistan laden with American bases.
A Pakistan that will give away its nuclear weapons...
I'm trying to preserve my country against extremist traitors who would tear it apart!
Traitors?
Like you.
I need you to get me inside this crowd.
Right.
You're going to confess to Trojan Horse.
Let the people of our country see you for the hypocrite you really are.
What do you hope to achieve?
The truth about these weapons will shatter your credibility, awakening a new Pakistan, a strong Pakistan, unafraid to use its nuclear weapons against its enemies in the West.
And why should I do your bidding?
In that crowd, a martyr is ready to detonate a bomb containing your VX gas.
He is awaiting my order to proceed.
Or if you comply, I can call him off.
You have to release this crowd.
Do you hear me?
I can't.
Not until all the delegates are evacuated.
They are my absolute priority.
Somebody's gonna get crushed to death!
You have to let them out now!
I'm sorry.
You will kill those people whether I talk or not.
Akmal.
My men will intercept him.
We've already stopped one bomber.
You can take that chance, General.
But the questions remains.
How do you weigh up the lives of thousands against your cherished reputation?
What, you feel sympathy for this man, Colonel?
Placed in this terrible position by a monster like me?
The man who killed John Porter?
I, John Porter, confess to the crime of being a British spy.
But you must have asked the question, who betrayed John Porter to me?
Why don't you tell her?
I would not lie to you, Eleanor.
His handler reported to me.
Porter was getting too close.
He learnt that the weapons were a hangover from the operation.
Knowledge of Trojan Horse would have torn Pakistan in half.
You gave him to Latif?
I... allowed certain elements within ISI to let his whereabouts be known.
A politician's answer.
But perhaps we shouldn't be too quick to judge.
I saw Porter's last report from Lahore.
He told you he stumbled across Trojan Horse, didn't he, Eleanor?
But did you tell him what you knew?
Let's be frank.
Mahmood, ATAT.
You suspected the connection
- right from the start.
- I...
But you hid it from your own section.
I tried to stop you.
But you only succeeded in helping me.
You didn't share your suspicions with the people who trusted you the most.
For what?
Your own ambition?
My only ambition has been to serve my country.
- For the sake of your career?
- Career!
- Reputation?
- Not my reputation.
- Then why?
- Because I was ashamed!
I was ashamed of what I'd done.
Then your shame killed Porter.
And the others, as if you'd blown their brains out yourself.
Your silence meant the sabotage of your own mission.
And with it, you were my greatest ally.
Come on.
Move through.
I see him!
Get down!
Down!
Get down!
Get down!
Don't shoot!
Look into the camera and confess.
Never.
I will not do your bidding.
- I'll do it, I'll do it.
I'll confess.
- No.
- It doesn't matter who says it.
- No, Eleanor, you cannot confess.
If you confess to Trojan Horse, you will destroy...
Oh, fuck you.
No, no.
Don't look at them.
Don't look at them!
No, don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
You look at me.
It's okay.
We're gonna let some of these people go, all right?
Go.
Go.
Now it's just you and me.
I need you to think.
It's a child.
It's a life.
Just give it to me.
It should have been my brother.
Put the phone down.
Give her here.
Seems for you, the lies have been difficult to live with, Colonel.
So why don't you unburden yourself?
I am Colonel Eleanor Grant,
British military intelligence.
Thank you, Colonel.
There's something else I'd like to say.
To my colleagues in Section 20.
Very well.
Shit.
Run!
Get out of here!
Run!
Run!
Mike.
Fuck.
Someone's armed the bomb!
Get these people out of here!
Okay.
Sinclair.
Talk to me.
I'm going to pull out the detonator.
No.
Don't touch the det, it's on a trip.
Okay.
Okay.
Then what do I do?
Which wire do I cut?
You have to cut the earth.
Which colour is the earth wire, Sinclair, which one?
It's the one that leads to the battery.
- The brown one?
The brown one?
- Um...
I'm not sure.
Which colour is the earth wire, Sinclair, which one?
Wait.
Sinclair, the green?
The brown?
Tell me.
Sinclair.
- Fuck.
- Green.
Finished?
That's very touching.
But I'll probably just edit that out.
Hey!
Colonel!
Damien, forgive me!
Colonel!
Latif!
Secrets are an occupational hazard in this job.
But I have kept too many for too long.
Perhaps the burden led to my mistakes.
But everything I have done, I have done for my country.
For my involvement in Trojan Horse, my failure to admit it, and my part in John Porter's death, I have nothing but regret.
To Major Sinclair, if you are still alive,
I wish you every success your doggedness and intellect deserve.
To Sergeant Richmond, for your camaraderie and your courage, I thank you.
Damien Scott, amongst my effects, there is a blue file.
I tried to tell you.
And to Michael Stonebridge, you are the finest soldier I have ever known.
Serving with you all has been a privilege and an honour.
Colonel Grant.
- Colonel Grant.
- Colonel Grant.
Colonel Grant.
What are you gonna do?
She did give me a second chance.
Guess I should be thankful for that.
You gotta make a decision, too, buddy boy.
Yeah, I know.
And?
I've already made it.
Well, fuck me.
Who's gonna make me look good now?
Shit.
- Daddy Stonebridge.
- Yeah, I know.
- Up all night.
- Yeah.
Not for the good reasons.
Fuck.
Step aside, Major.
We'd all understand if you pulled that trigger.
But the lives of thousands of people are at stake.
Hmm...
Secure him.
Dress his wounds.
John Porter...
Blood.
Sit forward.
Enjoy your stay at the organ farm?
Actually, I thought the food was shit.
So I discharged myself.
We're secure!
Careful.
He's clean.
Sergeant Richmond...
All your training to do this...woman's work.
Sergeant.
We have a hit!
Target 2.
Purchasing train ticket.
Where?
Big screen.
Kobanya Station, south-east suburb.
Satellite lock on Kobanya.
Target's carrying a case.
Right, he's on the train.
Where's it going?
Arrives Nyugati Main Station in 12 minutes.
If there is a bomb in that case...
He'll need a trigger mechanism.
Something like a cell phone.
Remember we're dealing with VX.
You will shoot to kill.
Copy that.
Yes, Ma'am.
Is it just me?
What?
Sinclair.
You gotta wonder about a guy that's gonna step between a bullet and Latif.

General Ramiz's announcement is expected...
Western leaders attending the World Security Summit in Budapest.
The stability of Pakistan which has nuclear weapons is high on the summit's agenda.
For us there, Jessica what's the late latest?
I report to you live from outside
Buda Palace as behind me, more of the delegates from the world's most powerful countries arrive to discuss security issues in the Middle East and elsewhere.
Now, although confidential, we suspect that Pakistan will be high up there on the agenda.
Along with the staggered withdrawal of Western troops from Afghanistan.
Now as you can see, a large crowd has formed...
Anything on the other target?
Nothing yet.
Whatever transport he's using, he's coming in under the radar...
And all the main delegates, they understand the need for absolute secrecy?
Yes, sir.
A discrete meeting room has been arranged just as you requested.
Good.
About time, Colonel.
Recognize it?
Should I be invoking my human rights?
Oh, for that you need to be human.
Terrorizing a peaceful city makes you something else...
How does a civilized, intelligent man become what you are?
You know better than anyone, Colonel.
How many deaths have you sanctioned?
Hmm...
As you can see, we're tracking your bomber.
We have face recognition software on every CCTV camera in this city.
Impressive.
He will be caught, and he will be neutralized.
But if you thought there was only one, you would have killed me already...
Target has disembarked.
We have visual!
Target getting of train at Nyugati Station.
Yeah, copy that.
We're approaching the station now.
See anything?
We've got no visual.
Repeat, no visual.
Found him.
Target's boarding a westbound subway.
It's rush hour...
If he detonates down there, he could kill thousands of people.
He's heading under the river.
You need to intercept further down the line!
Copy that.
We have no visual.
Target still on train, next stop...
You're thinking about Delhi, aren't you?
When we shook hands...
And you gave me Mahmood.
You must long for that moment again.
It would have saved a life.
She had forfeited her life.
And what about Sergeant John Porter?
Captain Kate Marshall...
Are they just pawns in your game?
Pawns that you pushed into the center of the board.
This will end today.
Finally, something we can agree on.
Target's off.
Batthyany Station!
Yeah, copy that.
We're en route.
Going down.
Go...
I think I got a visual on target.
Looks like he's coming up river side exit.
Target visual.
In pursuit.
If you get a headshot, take it!
Negative.
I've got no clear shot.
It's a fucking sardine can in here.
Where's that tram heading?
Due south, towards the palace.
Moving closer, I might have a chance.
Excuse me, coming through.
Excuse me.
Hey, hey, hey.
Shh...
Calm down.
Calm down.
Fuck off!
Fuck off.
Move, move, move!
Get the fuck back!
Sorry, move out of the way...
Get the fuck out of my way!
He's got a phone!
Drop it!
Drop it!
Shut the fuck up!
Move, move, move, move!
Cell phone!
Got it, got it, got it!
Move, move, get off!
Gimme the fucking phone!
What's happening?
Scott, Stonebridge, report.
I think he's armed it!
Fuck!
Oh, shit!
Fuck...
Get the fuck up!
You fucker.
Stay there.
Stay there.
Everyone get off the tram, bomb!
I'm opening the briefcase.
How you doing, Mike?
It's fucking empty!
Where's the fucking bomb?
Where's the fucking bomb?
Show me, where's the fucking bomb?
Huh, where's...
Where is it?
What the fuck is that?
Jesus, the bomb's in him!
It's in him.
It's in him!
Get off the tram!
Move, Scott!
Shut the doors, move!
Get out, Scott!
Move, move back!
Move away!
Everyone get back!
Everyone back!
Move back!
- Now!
- Move!
Shit!
Back up!
Back the fuck up!
Scott!
Scott!
Everyone back!
Lady, back, back!
Move!
Get away from the tram!
Get away from here!
Scott, report.
Get on the police...
You're gonna need decontamination units, hazmat suits, the works.
Is he using the VX?
Yeah.
It's nasty shit.
And you're okay?
Yeah, thanks for asking.
Explosion was contained within the tram.
No civilian casualties that I know of...
That shit is leaking out.
Hey, back up!
Back up!
Are you at a safe distance?
Affirmative, we're upwind.
This area needs to be sealed off.
All right, Mike, looks like the cavalry's here.
Let's go.
Scott.
Can you confirm how the device was detonated?
You really want to know?
It was inside the son of a bitch.
Alert the Hungarians.
Let them know what we're dealing with.
Got it.
There's no keeping a lid on this now...
We need to find that other bomber.
And fucking quick.
Colonel.
The bomber triggered a device onboard a tram.
Scott and Stonebridge managed to get everyone clear, and contain most of the blast.
The device was carried inside the bomber's body.
It's been a potential terrorist M.O. for awhile now.
A bomb in a cavity created by the removal of the spleen.
It seems Major Sinclair appreciates the measure of my achievement.
It's an obscenity.
Then it is just one of many.
Thank you, Major.
Colonel.
We've just received a report...
That there's been a large explosion in the city.
Now, we're all the way up here at the Buda Palace, and we heard a really loud bang.
There is still no indication as to what has caused that explosion.
But as you can see behind me, the riot police have been drafted in.
And they were quite calm, but now they are starting to get very, very anxious indeed.
Exposing innocent people to this poisonous, meaningless slaughter.
I'm not a nihilist, Colonel.
Everything I do has a purpose.
And what is that purpose?
If word of my presence here gets out, our enemies at home, will undermine my presidential campaign.
And with it our chances for peace.
Yes.
I'm sorry, sir, we have to go turn around.
Why?
We've been given a new location.
Well, what is happening?
Some incident at the Summit.
Incident?
Please!
So what are you hoping to achieve?
Becoming the poster boy for Islamist Jihad?
A new bin Laden?
Oh, please...
You insult me by comparing me to these religious fanatics.
Oh, and you're not?
I'm a pragmatist.
A Pakistani patriot.
You disgrace your country.
I honor my country, as I always have.
I have no regrets.
Can you say the same?
I am not going to let this happen.
My will is greater than yours.
Then you know nothing of my will.
Mr. Laszlo, this is Major Sinclair.
Come on, guys.
What the fuck are we waiting for?
Return to base.
Still awaiting Intel on the second Target.
- That was not our intention.
- Okay, listen up...
I want you running scans on every subway station...
Mr. Laszlo, Colonel Grant cannot come to the phone.
Tell me, have you told Sergeant Scott that you framed him?
Does he know your role in Trojan Horse?
We understand that an order has been given to evacuate all of the world leaders...
What's more worrying is that the entire area surrounding the explosion has been sealed off...
And hazmat decontamination teams have been called to the site.
Emergency services are asking people to stay inside...
and close their doors and...
We intercepted a local police radio call.
A VIP convoy was ambushed en route from the airport.
Ambushed?
That's strange.
I thought all the leaders had arrived.
They have.
So, who's this?
No power on bank one.
Got the comms.
Everyone down!
Murph, catch!
Shit, you okay?
Give me my gun!
Look, you're injured...
I'm not dying without my fucking gun!
1, 2, 3...
Fuck!
Clear!
Fuck.
Sinclair, Richmond, you all right?
Here!
Julia, you all right?
What happened?
Colonel...
Colonel!
They've gone.
Shit.
Thank you.
- How the fuck did they find us?
- I don't know.
You don't know?
How convenient you don't fucking know...
Enough!
Christ.
I haven't betrayed anyone!
I haven't compromised anyone!
So if you want to beat some kind of confession out of me, you're gonna wait until there are no more terrorists running around this city...
With chemical bombs stitched inside their fucking bodies!
Fine.
Good.
What do we got?
Well, the mainframe's fucked.
But the laptop should be able to hook up to London.
Let me help you.
The first terrorist only tried to detonate once he was confronted.
If it was just about killing people, he would have done it on the subway.
Laszlo.
That tram was headed towards the palace...
Major Sinclair?
I demand to speak with your superior, right now.
She's not here.
As you can see, our unit came under attack...
Your unit has no mandate or authorization...
With respect, I have already stopped one suicide bomber in this town...
And we saved the lives of God knows how many people.
We think there's another, and he's on his way to the Palace.
So, please, either help us or get out of our way!
Is this your suspect?
Yes, sir.
Do you think you can recognize this man in the crowd?
Yes, I could.
My officers will escort you back to the palace.
We'll have tactical support.
Thank you.
Major.
What about the Colonel?
The terrorist threat first.
Besides, we have no idea where she is.
We do if she's with Latif.
How?
I put a tracker in his dressing.
Nice work.
Just getting a signal now.
Tura.
Thirty-eight kilometers from here.
Okay, Michael, you take the bomber.
Scott, you take the Colonel.
What the hell happened here?
Carnage.
By the way, Sinclair, you hit like a girl.
I don't know, he kind of hit you pretty good, didn't he?
It fucking hurt, buddy, but don't tell him.
Hey, Scott.
Yeah.
Bring her back.
Shall do, buddy.
So what can you tell me about this man, Major?
Thank you.
We know that he's Chechen.
But we have no name, no date of birth...
Major, I'm sorry to interrupt.
Just before she was killed, Sally intercepted a communication between
Hungarian security and Pakistani intelligence.
It refers to the VIP convoy that was ambushed.
The car that was ambushed, he was in it.
General Akmal Ramiz.
Akmal?
The Pakistani presidential candidate?
And our best hope of peace in Pakistan.
Latif...
Your invitation to the summit was not as secret as you thought, General.
You have John Allen to thank.
You endanger the lives of thousands with chemical weapons for one man?
As ever, Colonel, you see things so one-dimensionally.
General Ramiz is a liar, and a charlatan.
But this is not a mere abduction.
You are witness to a moment in history, and I am honored to have such distinguished guests as the two principal architects of Operation Trojan Horse.
Trojan Horse was only ever supposed to be an intelligence operation.
Falsifying the evidence of WMDs in Iraq made the case for war.
But the road to hell is paved with good intentions, isn't that right, Colonel?
Intelligence wasn't enough.
Which is where ATAT and the Pakistani military proved so helpful.
So the weapons were made and transported to be placed inside Iraq.
Sergeant?
Comms are back on.
Thank you.
Sir?
Scott?
What's your position.
ETA in 10.
Copy that.
Trojan Horse was necessary at the time.
We had to justify the action of our western allies to our own people.
This is ancient history.
But its relics survive.
It is those relics that I have sought and obtained, the very cache of VX that you intended to plant inside Iraq.
They were supposed to be destroyed.
The temptation to keep them was too strong.
However, ATAT didn't hide them well enough, so today I deploy them,
while the future of my nation is casually sealed over lunch by foreign imperialists.
And you grovel at their feet...
I came here to save Pakistan!
You want a craven Pakistan!
A Pakistan littered with American bases!
A Pakistan that would give away its nuclear weapons for an empty promise...
I am trying to preserve my country against extremist traitors who would tear it apart!
Traitors... like you!
I need you to get me inside this crowd.
Right.
Move.
You are going to confess to Trojan Horse.
Let the people of our country see you for the hypocrite you really are.
What do you hope to achieve?
The truth about these weapons will shatter your credibility, awakening a new Pakistan, a strong Pakistan.
Unafraid to use its nuclear weapons against its enemies in the west.
And why should I do your bidding?
...can't tell you who they are.
In that crowd, a martyr is ready to detonate a bomb containing your VX gas.
He is waiting my order to proceed.
Or, if you comply, I can call him off.
They have to release this crowd.
Do you hear me?
I can't.
Not until all the delegates are evacuated.
They are my absolute priority.
Someone is going to get crushed to death!
You have to let them out now!
I'm sorry.
You will kill those people whether I talk or not.
Akmal, my men will intercept him.
We've already stopped one bomber.
You can take that chance, General.
But the question remains.
How do you weigh the lives of thousands against your cherished reputation?
What, you feel sympathy for this man, Colonel?
Placed in this terrible position by a monster like me?
The man who killed John Porter?
I, John Porter, confess to the crime of being a British spy.
But you must have asked the question, who betrayed John Porter to me?
Why don't you tell her?
I would not lie to you, Eleanor.
His handler reported to me.
Porter was getting too close.
He learned that the weapons were a hangover from the operation.
Knowledge of Trojan Horse would have torn Pakistan in half...
You gave him to Latif?
I allowed certain elements within ISI to let his whereabouts be known.
A politician's answer.
But perhaps we shouldn't be too quick to judge.
I saw Porter's last report from Lahore.
He told you he'd stumbled across Trojan Horse, didn't he, Eleanor?
But did you tell him what you knew?
Let's be frank.
Mahmood, ATAT.
You suspected the connection right from the start...
I...
But you hid it from your own section.
I tried to stop you.
But you only succeeded in helping me.
You didn't share your suspicions with the people who trusted you the most.
For what?
Your own ambition?
My only ambition has been to serve my country.
For the sake of your career?
Not my career.
Reputation?
Not my reputation.
Then why?
Because I was ashamed!
I was ashamed of what I'd done.
Then your shame killed Porter, and the others, as if you'd blown their brains out yourself.
Your silence meant the sabotage of your own mission, and with it you were my greatest ally.
Move through!
I see him!
Get down!
Down!
Get down!
Get down!
Don't shoot!
Look into the camera and confess.
Never.
I will not do your bidding.
I'll do it, I'll do it.
I'll confess.
No!
Does it matter who says it?
No, Eleanor, you cannot confess.
If you confess to Trojan Horse you will destroy...
No...
Oh, fuck you...
No, no, don't look at them.
No, don't shoot, don't shoot!
Don't look at them!
You look at me.
It's okay.
We're gonna let some of these people go, all right?
Go.
Go!
Now it's just you and me.
I need you to think.
It's a child.
It's a life.
Just give it to me.
It should have been my brother.
Put the phone down.
Give her here.
It seems for you the lies have been difficult to live with, Colonel.
So why don't you unburden yourself?
I am Colonel Eleanor Grant, British military intelligence.
Ahhh!
Ahhh!
Thank you, Colonel.
There's something else I'd like to say, to my colleagues in Section 20.
Very well.
Shit.
Run!
Get out of here!
Run!
Run!
Mike...
Fuck!
Someone's armed the bomb!
Get these people out of here!
Okay.
Sinclair, talk to me.
I'm going to pull out the detonator.
No, don't touch the det, it's on a trip.
Fuck.
Okay.
Then what do I do?
Which wire do I cut?
You have to cut the earth.
Which color is the earth wire, Sinclair?
Which one?
It's the one that leads to the battery.
The brown one, the brown one?
Um, I'm not sure.
What color is the earth wire, Sinclair?
Which one?
Wait!
Fuck.
Sinclair!
Green?
Brown?
Tell me!
Sinclair?
Fuck it!
Green.
Finished?
It's very touching, but I'll probably just edit that out.
Colonel!
Damien, forgive me!
Colonel!
Colonel!
Latif!
Secrets are an occupational hazard in this job.
But I have kept too many for too long.
Perhaps the burden led to my mistakes.
But everything I've done, I have done for my country.
For my involvement in Trojan Horse, my failure to admit it, and my part in John
Porter's death, I have nothing but regret.
To Major Sinclair, if you're still alive, I wish you every success your doggedness and intellect deserve.
To Sergeant Richmond, for your camaraderie and your courage, I thank you.
Damien Scott.
Amongst my effects there is a blue file.
I tried to tell you.
And to Michael Stonebridge, you are the finest soldier I have ever known.
Serving with you all has been a privilege and an honor.
Colonel Grant.
Colonel Grant.
Colonel Grant.
Colonel Grant.
What are you going to do?
She did give me a second chance.
I guess I should be thankful for that.
You gotta make a decision too, buddy boy.
Yeah, I know.
And?
I've already made it.
Well, fuck me.
Who's gonna make me look good now?
Huh?
Shit.
Daddy Stonebridge!
I know.
Up all night.
Yeah.
Not for the good reasons.
Fuck.

Previously on Strike Back
We've recovered John Allen's PDA.
It originated here... a remote part of the province of Chechnya.
If there's one thing this place has plenty of, it's potential suicide bombers.
Your choice is simple.
continue to risk your life, or be a father, and a husband.
Stop looking for the dirt on me and start looking for a breach in your own section!
So where is this breach?
You tell me, Sinclair.
If this device were to go off, anyone enveloped would be killed, instantly.
We are ready.
Michael!
Step aside, Major.
We'd all understand if you pulled that trigger.
But the lives of thousands of people are at stake.
Hmm...
Secure him.
Dress his wounds.
John Porter...
Blood.

Give me my gun!
Look, you're injured...
I'm not dying without my fucking gun!
1, 2, 3...
Fuck!
Clear!
Fuck.
Sinclair, Richmond, you all right?
Here!
Julia, you all right?
What happened?
Colonel...
Colonel!
They've gone.
Shit.
Thank you.
- How the fuck did they find us?
- I don't know.
You don't know?
How convenient you don't fucking know...
Enough!
Christ.
I haven't betrayed anyone!
I haven't compromised anyone!
So if you want to beat some kind of confession out of me, you're gonna wait until there are no more terrorists running around this city...
With chemical bombs stitched inside their fucking bodies!
Fine.
Good.
What do we got?
Well, the mainframe's fucked.
But the laptop should be able to hook up to London.
Let me help you.
The first terrorist only tried to detonate once he was confronted.
If it was just about killing people, he would have done it on the subway.
Laszlo.
That tram was headed towards the palace...
Major Sinclair?
I demand to speak with your superior, right now.
She's not here.
As you can see, our unit came under attack...
Your unit has no mandate or authorization...
With respect, I have already stopped one suicide bomber in this town...
And we saved the lives of God knows how many people.
We think there's another, and he's on his way to the Palace.
So, please, either help us or get out of our way!
Is this your suspect?
Yes, sir.
Do you think you can recognize this man in the crowd?
Yes, I could.
My officers will escort you back to the palace.
We'll have tactical support.
Thank you.
Major.
What about the Colonel?
The terrorist threat first.
Besides, we have no idea where she is.
We do if she's with Latif.
How?
I put a tracker in his dressing.
Nice work.
Just getting a signal now.
Tura.
Thirty-eight kilometers from here.
Okay, Michael, you take the bomber.
Scott, you take the Colonel.
What the hell happened here?
Carnage.
By the way, Sinclair, you hit like a girl.
I don't know, he kind of hit you pretty good, didn't he?
It fucking hurt, buddy, but don't tell him.
Hey, Scott.
Yeah.
Bring her back.
Shall do, buddy.
So what can you tell me about this man, Major?
Thank you.
We know that he's Chechen.
But we have no name, no date of birth...
Major, I'm sorry to interrupt.
Just before she was killed, Sally intercepted a communication between
Hungarian security and Pakistani intelligence.
It refers to the VIP convoy that was ambushed.
The car that was ambushed, he was in it.
General Akmal Ramiz.
Akmal?
The Pakistani presidential candidate?
And our best hope of peace in Pakistan.
Latif...
Your invitation to the summit was not as secret as you thought, General.
You have John Allen to thank.
You endanger the lives of thousands with chemical weapons for one man?
As ever, Colonel, you see things so one-dimensionally.
General Ramiz is a liar, and a charlatan.
But this is not a mere abduction.
You are witness to a moment in history, and I am honored to have such distinguished guests as the two principal architects of Operation Trojan Horse.
Trojan Horse was only ever supposed to be an intelligence operation.
Falsifying the evidence of WMDs in Iraq made the case for war.
But the road to hell is paved with good intentions, isn't that right, Colonel?
Intelligence wasn't enough.
Which is where ATAT and the Pakistani military proved so helpful.
So the weapons were made and transported to be placed inside Iraq.
Sergeant?
Comms are back on.
Thank you.
Sir?
Scott?
What's your position.
ETA in 10.
Copy that.
Trojan Horse was necessary at the time.
We had to justify the action of our western allies to our own people.
This is ancient history.
But its relics survive.
It is those relics that I have sought and obtained, the very cache of VX that you intended to plant inside Iraq.
They were supposed to be destroyed.
The temptation to keep them was too strong.
However, ATAT didn't hide them well enough, so today I deploy them,
while the future of my nation is casually sealed over lunch by foreign imperialists.
And you grovel at their feet...
I came here to save Pakistan!
You want a craven Pakistan!
A Pakistan littered with American bases!
A Pakistan that would give away its nuclear weapons for an empty promise...
I am trying to preserve my country against extremist traitors who would tear it apart!
Traitors... like you!
I need you to get me inside this crowd.
Right.
Move.
You are going to confess to Trojan Horse.
Let the people of our country see you for the hypocrite you really are.
What do you hope to achieve?
The truth about these weapons will shatter your credibility, awakening a new Pakistan, a strong Pakistan.
Unafraid to use its nuclear weapons against its enemies in the west.
And why should I do your bidding?
...can't tell you who they are.
In that crowd, a martyr is ready to detonate a bomb containing your VX gas.
He is waiting my order to proceed.
Or, if you comply, I can call him off.
They have to release this crowd.
Do you hear me?
I can't.
Not until all the delegates are evacuated.
They are my absolute priority.
Someone is going to get crushed to death!
You have to let them out now!
I'm sorry.
You will kill those people whether I talk or not.
Akmal, my men will intercept him.
We've already stopped one bomber.
You can take that chance, General.
But the question remains.
How do you weigh the lives of thousands against your cherished reputation?
What, you feel sympathy for this man, Colonel?
Placed in this terrible position by a monster like me?
The man who killed John Porter?
I, John Porter, confess to the crime of being a British spy.
But you must have asked the question, who betrayed John Porter to me?
Why don't you tell her?
I would not lie to you, Eleanor.
His handler reported to me.
Porter was getting too close.
He learned that the weapons were a hangover from the operation.
Knowledge of Trojan Horse would have torn Pakistan in half...
You gave him to Latif?
I allowed certain elements within ISI to let his whereabouts be known.
A politician's answer.
But perhaps we shouldn't be too quick to judge.
I saw Porter's last report from Lahore.
He told you he'd stumbled across Trojan Horse, didn't he, Eleanor?
But did you tell him what you knew?
Let's be frank.
Mahmood, ATAT.
You suspected the connection right from the start...
I...
But you hid it from your own section.
I tried to stop you.
But you only succeeded in helping me.
You didn't share your suspicions with the people who trusted you the most.
For what?
Your own ambition?
My only ambition has been to serve my country.
For the sake of your career?
Not my career.
Reputation?
Not my reputation.
Then why?
Because I was ashamed!
I was ashamed of what I'd done.
Then your shame killed Porter, and the others, as if you'd blown their brains out yourself.
Your silence meant the sabotage of your own mission, and with it you were my greatest ally.
Move through!
I see him!
Get down!
Down!
Get down!
Get down!
Don't shoot!
Look into the camera and confess.
Never.
I will not do your bidding.
I'll do it, I'll do it.
I'll confess.
No!
Does it matter who says it?
No, Eleanor, you cannot confess.
If you confess to Trojan Horse you will destroy...
No...
Oh, fuck you...
No, no, don't look at them.
No, don't shoot, don't shoot!
Don't look at them!
You look at me.
It's okay.
We're gonna let some of these people go, all right?
Go.
Go!
Now it's just you and me.
I need you to think.
It's a child.
It's a life.
Just give it to me.
It should have been my brother.
Put the phone down.
Give her here.
It seems for you the lies have been difficult to live with, Colonel.
So why don't you unburden yourself?
I am Colonel Eleanor Grant, British military intelligence.
Ahhh!
Ahhh!
Thank you, Colonel.
There's something else I'd like to say, to my colleagues in Section 20.
Very well.
Shit.
Run!
Get out of here!
Run!
Run!
Mike...
Fuck!
Someone's armed the bomb!
Get these people out of here!
Okay.
Sinclair, talk to me.
I'm going to pull out the detonator.
No, don't touch the det, it's on a trip.
Fuck.
Okay.
Then what do I do?
Which wire do I cut?
You have to cut the earth.
Which color is the earth wire, Sinclair?
Which one?
It's the one that leads to the battery.
The brown one, the brown one?
Um, I'm not sure.
What color is the earth wire, Sinclair?
Which one?
Wait!
Fuck.
Sinclair!
Green?
Brown?
Tell me!
Sinclair?
Fuck it!
Green.
Finished?
It's very touching, but I'll probably just edit that out.
Colonel!
Damien, forgive me!
Colonel!
Colonel!
Latif!
Secrets are an occupational hazard in this job.
But I have kept too many for too long.
Perhaps the burden led to my mistakes.
But everything I've done, I have done for my country.
For my involvement in Trojan Horse, my failure to admit it, and my part in John
Porter's death, I have nothing but regret.
To Major Sinclair, if you're still alive, I wish you every success your doggedness and intellect deserve.
To Sergeant Richmond, for your camaraderie and your courage, I thank you.
Damien Scott.
Amongst my effects there is a blue file.
I tried to tell you.
And to Michael Stonebridge, you are the finest soldier I have ever known.
Serving with you all has been a privilege and an honor.
Colonel Grant.
Colonel Grant.
Colonel Grant.
Colonel Grant.
What are you going to do?
She did give me a second chance.
I guess I should be thankful for that.
You gotta make a decision too, buddy boy.
Yeah, I know.
And?
I've already made it.
Well, fuck me.
Who's gonna make me look good now?
Huh?
Shit.
Daddy Stonebridge!
I know.
Up all night.
Yeah.
Not for the good reasons.
Fuck.

Previously on Strike Back
We've recovered John Allen's PDA.
It originated here... a remote part of the province of Chechnya.
If there's one thing this place has plenty of, it's potential suicide bombers.
Your choice is simple.
continue to risk your life, or be a father, and a husband.
Stop looking for the dirt on me and start looking for a breach in your own section!
So where is this breach?
You tell me, Sinclair.
If this device were to go off, anyone enveloped would be killed, instantly.
We are ready.
Michael!
Step aside, Major.
We'd all understand if you pulled that trigger.
But the lives of thousands of people are at stake.
Hmm...
Secure him.
Dress his wounds.
John Porter...
Blood.
Sit forward.
Enjoy your stay at the organ farm?
Actually, I thought the food was shit.
So I discharged myself.
We're secure!
Careful.
He's clean.
Sergeant Richmond...
All your training to do this...woman's work.
Sergeant.
We have a hit!
Target 2.
Purchasing train ticket.
Where?
Big screen.
Kobanya Station, south-east suburb.
Satellite lock on Kobanya.
Target's carrying a case.
Right, he's on the train.
Where's it going?
Arrives Nyugati Main Station in 12 minutes.
If there is a bomb in that case...
He'll need a trigger mechanism.
Something like a cell phone.
Remember we're dealing with VX.
You will shoot to kill.
Copy that.
Yes, Ma'am.
Is it just me?
What?
Sinclair.
You gotta wonder about a guy that's gonna step between a bullet and Latif.
d Strike Back 02x10 d Episode 10 Original Air Date on October 21, 2011
== sync, corrected by elderman == d
General Ramiz's announcement is expected...
Western leaders attending the World Security Summit in Budapest.
The stability of Pakistan which has nuclear weapons is high on the summit's agenda.
For us there, Jessica what's the late latest?
I report to you live from outside
Buda Palace as behind me, more of the delegates from the world's most powerful countries arrive to discuss security issues in the Middle East and elsewhere.
Now, although confidential, we suspect that Pakistan will be high up there on the agenda.
Along with the staggered withdrawal of Western troops from Afghanistan.
Now as you can see, a large crowd has formed...
Anything on the other target?
Nothing yet.
Whatever transport he's using, he's coming in under the radar...
And all the main delegates, they understand the need for absolute secrecy?
Yes, sir.
A discreet meeting room has been arranged just as you requested.
Good.
About time, Colonel.
Recognize it?
Should I be invoking my human rights?
Oh, for that you need to be human.
Terrorizing a peaceful city makes you something else...
How does a civilized, intelligent man become what you are?
You know better than anyone, Colonel.
How many deaths have you sanctioned?
Hmm...
As you can see, we're tracking your bomber.
We have face recognition software on every CCTV camera in this city.
Impressive.
He will be caught, and he will be neutralized.
But if you thought there was only one, you would have killed me already...
Target has disembarked.
We have visual!
Target getting of train at Nyugati Station.
Yeah, copy that.
We're approaching the station now.
See anything?
We've got no visual.
Repeat, no visual.
Found him.
Target's boarding a westbound subway.
It's rush hour...
If he detonates down there, he could kill thousands of people.
He's heading under the river.
You need to intercept further down the line!
Copy that.
We have no visual.
Target still on train, next stop...
You're thinking about Delhi, aren't you?
When we shook hands...
And you gave me Mahmood.
You must long for that moment again.
It would have saved a life.
She had forfeited her life.
And what about Sergeant John Porter?
Captain Kate Marshall...
Are they just pawns in your game?
Pawns that you pushed into the center of the board.
This will end today.
Finally, something we can agree on.
Target's off.
Batthyany Station!
Yeah, copy that.
We're en route.
Going down.
Go...
I think I got a visual on target.
Looks like he's coming up river side exit.
Target visual.
In pursuit.
If you get a headshot, take it!
Negative.
I've got no clear shot.
It's a fucking sardine can in here.
Where's that tram heading?
Due south, towards the palace.
Moving closer, I might have a chance.
Excuse me, coming through.
Excuse me.
Hey, hey, hey.
Shh...
Calm down.
Calm down.
Fuck off!
Fuck off.
Move, move, move!
Get the fuck back!
Sorry, move out of the way...
Get the fuck out of my way!
He's got a phone!
Drop it!
Drop it!
Shut the fuck up!
Move, move, move, move!
Cell phone!
Got it, got it, got it!
Move, move, get off!
Gimme the fucking phone!
What's happening?
Scott, Stonebridge, report.
I think he's armed it!
Fuck!
Oh, shit!
Fuck...
Get the fuck up!
You fucker.
Stay there.
Stay there.
Everyone get off the tram, bomb!
I'm opening the briefcase.
How you doing, Mike?
It's fucking empty!
Where's the fucking bomb?
Where's the fucking bomb?
Show me, where's the fucking bomb?
Huh, where's...
Where is it?
What the fuck is that?
Jesus, the bomb's in him!
It's in him.
It's in him!
Get off the tram!
Move, Scott!
Shut the doors, move!
Get out, Scott!
Move, move back!
Move away!
Everyone get back!
Everyone back!
Move back!
- Now!
- Move!
Shit!
Back up!
Back the fuck up!
Scott!
Scott!
Everyone back!
Lady, back, back!
Move!
Get away from the tram!
Get away from here!
Scott, report.
Get on the police...
You're gonna need decontamination units, hazmat suits, the works.
Is he using the VX?
Yeah.
It's nasty shit.
And you're okay?
Yeah, thanks for asking.
Explosion was contained within the tram.
No civilian casualties that I know of...
That shit is leaking out.
Hey, back up!
Back up!
Are you at a safe distance?
Affirmative, we're upwind.
This area needs to be sealed off.
All right, Mike, looks like the cavalry's here.
Let's go.
Scott.
Can you confirm how the device was detonated?
You really want to know?
It was inside the son of a bitch.
Alert the Hungarians.
Let them know what we're dealing with.
Got it.
There's no keeping a lid on this now...
We need to find that other bomber.
And fucking quick.
Colonel.
The bomber triggered a device onboard a tram.
Scott and Stonebridge managed to get everyone clear, and contain most of the blast.
The device was carried inside the bomber's body.
It's been a potential terrorist M.O. for awhile now.
A bomb in a cavity created by the removal of the spleen.
It seems Major Sinclair appreciates the measure of my achievement.
It's an obscenity.
Then it is just one of many.
Thank you, Major.
Colonel.
We've just received a report...
That there's been a large explosion in the city.
Now, we're all the way up here at the Buda Palace, and we heard a really loud bang.
There is still no indication as to what has caused that explosion.
But as you can see behind me, the riot police have been drafted in.
And they were quite calm, but now they are starting to get very, very anxious indeed.
Exposing innocent people to this poisonous, meaningless slaughter.
I'm not a nihilist, Colonel.
Everything I do has a purpose.
And what is that purpose?
If word of my presence here gets out, our enemies at home, will undermine my presidential campaign.
And with it our chances for peace.
Yes.
I'm sorry, sir, we have to go turn around.
Why?
We've been given a new location.
Well, what is happening?
Some incident at the Summit.
Incident?
Please!
So what are you hoping to achieve?
Becoming the poster boy for Islamist Jihad?
A new bin Laden?
Oh, please...
You insult me by comparing me to these religious fanatics.
Oh, and you're not?
I'm a pragmatist.
A Pakistani patriot.
You disgrace your country.
I honor my country, as I always have.
I have no regrets.
Can you say the same?
I am not going to let this happen.
My will is greater than yours.
Then you know nothing of my will.
Mr. Laszlo, this is Major Sinclair.
Come on, guys.
What the fuck are we waiting for?
Return to base.
Still awaiting Intel on the second Target.
- That was not our intention.
- Okay, listen up...
I want you running scans on every subway station...
Mr. Laszlo, Colonel Grant cannot come to the phone.
Tell me, have you told Sergeant Scott that you framed him?
Does he know your role in Trojan Horse?
We understand that an order has been given to evacuate all of the world leaders...
What's more worrying is that the entire area surrounding the explosion has been sealed off...
And hazmat decontamination teams have been called to the site.
Emergency services are asking people to stay inside...
and close their doors and...
We intercepted a local police radio call.
A VIP convoy was ambushed en route from the airport.
Ambushed?
That's strange.
I thought all the leaders had arrived.
They have.
So, who's this?
No power on bank one.
Got the comms.
Everyone down!
Murph, catch!
Shit, you okay?
Give me my gun!
Look, you're injured...
I'm not dying without my fucking gun!
1, 2, 3...
Fuck!
Clear!
Fuck.
Sinclair, Richmond, you all right?
Here!
Julia, you all right?
What happened?
Colonel...
Colonel!
They've gone.
Shit.
Thank you.
- How the fuck did they find us?
- I don't know.
You don't know?
How convenient you don't fucking know...
Enough!
Christ.
I haven't betrayed anyone!
I haven't compromised anyone!
So if you want to beat some kind of confession out of me, you're gonna wait until there are no more terrorists running around this city...
With chemical bombs stitched inside their fucking bodies!
Fine.
Good.
What do we got?
Well, the mainframe's fucked.
But the laptop should be able to hook up to London.
Let me help you.

Yes, sir.

Yes, I could.
My officers will escort you back to the palace.
We'll have tactical support.

Shall do, buddy.
So what can you tell me about this man, Major?

I will not do your bidding.
I'll do it, I'll do it.
I'll confess.
No!
Does it matter who says it?
No, Eleanor, you cannot confess.
If you confess to Trojan Horse you will destroy...
No...
Oh, fuck you...
No, no, don't look at them.
No, don't shoot, don't shoot!
Don't look at them!
You look at me.
It's okay.
We're gonna let some of these people go, all right?
Go.

Shit.
Run!
Get out of here!
Run!
Run!
Mike...
Fuck!
Someone's armed the bomb!
Get these people out of here!
Okay.
Sinclair, talk to me.
I'm going to pull out the detonator.
No, don't touch the det, it's on a trip.
Fuck.
Okay.
Then what do I do?
Which wire do I cut?
You have to cut the earth.
Which color is the earth wire, Sinclair?
Which one?
It's the one that leads to the battery.
The brown one, the brown one?
Um, I'm not sure.
What color is the earth wire, Sinclair?

Wait!
Fuck.
Sinclair!

Brown?
Tell me!
Sinclair?
Fuck it!

It's very touching, but I'll probably just edit that out.
Colonel!
Damien, forgive me!
Colonel!
Colonel!
Latif!
Secrets are an occupational hazard in this job.
But I have kept too many for too long.
Perhaps the burden led to my mistakes.
But everything I've done, I have done for my country.
For my involvement in Trojan Horse, my failure to admit it, and my part in John
Porter's death, I have nothing but regret.
To Major Sinclair, if you're still alive, I wish you every success your doggedness and intellect deserve.
To Sergeant Richmond, for your camaraderie and your courage, I thank you.
Damien Scott.
Amongst my effects there is a blue file.
I tried to tell you.
And to Michael Stonebridge, you are the finest soldier I have ever known.
Serving with you all has been a privilege and an honor.
Colonel Grant.
Colonel Grant.
Colonel Grant.
Colonel Grant.
What are you going to do?
She did give me a second chance.
I guess I should be thankful for that.
You gotta make a decision too, buddy boy.
Yeah, I know.
And?
I've already made it.
Well, fuck me.
Who's gonna make me look good now?
Huh?
Shit.
Daddy Stonebridge!
I know.
Up all night.
Yeah.
Not for the good reasons.
Fuck.

Hmm...
Secure him.
Dress his wounds.

Blood.
Sit forward.
Enjoy your stay at the organ farm?
Actually, I thought the food was shit.

Where?
SINCLAIR:
Big screen.
Kobanya Station, south-east suburb.
(COMPUTERIZED VOICE) Satellite lock on Kobanya.
Target's carrying a case.
Right, he's on the train.
Where's it going?
Arrives Nyugati Main Station in 12 minutes.
If there is a bomb in that case...
He'll need a trigger mechanism.
Something like a cell phone.
Remember we're dealing with VX.
You will shoot to kill.
Copy that.
Yes, Ma'am.
Is it just me?
What?

You gotta wonder about a guy that's gonna step between a bullet and Latif.

MALE REPORTER:
General Ramiz's announcement is expected...
Western leaders attending the World Security Summit in Budapest.
The stability of Pakistan which has nuclear weapons is high on the summit's agenda.
For us there, Jessica what's the late latest?
(PEOPLE PROTESTING)
FEMALE REPORTER:
I report to you live from outside
Buda Palace as behind me, more of the delegates from the world's most powerful countries arrive to discuss security issues in the Middle East and elsewhere.
Now, although confidential, we suspect that Pakistan will be high up there on the agenda.
Along with the staggered withdrawal of Western troops from Afghanistan.
Now as you can see, a large crowd has formed...
Anything on the other target?
Nothing yet.
Whatever transport he's using, he's coming in under the radar...
And all the main delegates, they understand the need for absolute secrecy?
Yes, sir.
A discrete meeting room has been arranged just as you requested.
Good.
About time, Colonel.
Recognize it?
Should I be invoking my human rights?
Oh, for that you need to be human.
Terrorizing a peaceful city makes you something else...
How does a civilized, intelligent man become what you are?
You know better than anyone, Colonel.
How many deaths have you sanctioned?
Hmm...
As you can see, we're tracking your bomber.
We have face recognition software on every CCTV camera in this city.
Impressive.
He will be caught, and he will be neutralized.
But if you thought there was only one, you would have killed me already...
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
Target has disembarked.
We have visual!
Target getting of train at Nyugati Station.
STONEBRIDGE: (OVER COMMS) Yeah, copy that.
We're approaching the station now.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON P.A.)
STONEBRIDGE:
See anything?
SCOTT:
We've got no visual.
(OVER COMMS) Repeat, no visual.
Found him.
Target's boarding a westbound subway.
It's rush hour...
If he detonates down there, he could kill thousands of people.
He's heading under the river.
SINCLAIR:
You need to intercept further down the line!
STONEBRIDGE:
Copy that.
We have no visual.
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
Target still on train, next stop...
You're thinking about Delhi, aren't you?
When we shook hands...
And you gave me Mahmood.
You must long for that moment again.
It would have saved a life.
She had forfeited her life.
And what about Sergeant John Porter?
Captain Kate Marshall...
Are they just pawns in your game?
Pawns that you pushed into the center of the board.
This will end today.
Finally, something we can agree on.
Target's off.
Batthyany Station!
STONEBRIDGE:
Yeah, copy that.
We're en route.
Going down.
Go...
(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON P.A.)
SCOTT: (OVER COMMS) I think I got a visual on target.
Looks like he's coming up river side exit.
Target visual.
In pursuit.
If you get a headshot, take it!
Negative.
I've got no clear shot.
It's a fucking sardine can in here.
Where's that tram heading?
Due south, towards the palace.
Moving closer, I might have a chance.
Excuse me, coming through.
Excuse me.

It's nasty shit.
RICHMOND: (ON COMMS) And you're okay?
(LAUGHS) Yeah, thanks for asking.

Explosion was contained within the tram.
No civilian casualties that I know of...
That shit is leaking out.
STONEBRIDGE:
Hey, back up!
Back up!
Are you at a safe distance?
Affirmative, we're upwind.
This area needs to be sealed off.
All right, Mike, looks like the cavalry's here.
Let's go.
Scott.
Can you confirm how the device was detonated?
You really want to know?
SCOTT:
It was inside the son of a bitch.
Alert the Hungarians.
Let them know what we're dealing with.
Got it.
There's no keeping a lid on this now...
We need to find that other bomber.
And fucking quick.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
(SPEAKING HUNGARIAN)
(PROTESTORS YELLING)
(IN HUNGARIAN)
(CONTINUES IN HUNGARIAN)
Colonel.
The bomber triggered a device onboard a tram.
Scott and Stonebridge managed to get everyone clear, and contain most of the blast.
The device was carried inside the bomber's body.
It's been a potential terrorist M.O. for awhile now.
A bomb in a cavity created by the removal of the spleen.
It seems Major Sinclair appreciates the measure of my achievement.
It's an obscenity.
Then it is just one of many.
Thank you, Major.
Colonel.
FEMALE REPORTER:
We've just received a report...
That there's been a large explosion in the city.
Now, we're all the way up here at the Buda Palace, and we heard a really loud bang.
There is still no indication as to what has caused that explosion.
But as you can see behind me, the riot police have been drafted in.
And they were quite calm, but now they are starting to get very, very anxious indeed.
(CHANTING)
Exposing innocent people to this poisonous, meaningless slaughter.
I'm not a nihilist, Colonel.
Everything I do has a purpose.
And what is that purpose?
RAMIZ:
If word of my presence here gets out, our enemies at home, will undermine my presidential campaign.
And with it our chances for peace.
(SPEAKING IN HUNGARIAN) (PHONE RINGING)
Yes.
(INCOHERENT SPEAKING ON PHONE)
I'm sorry, sir, we have to go turn around.
Why?
We've been given a new location.
Well, what is happening?
Some incident at the Summit.

(TIRES SCREECHING)
(YELLING IN HUNGARIAN)

So what are you hoping to achieve?
Becoming the poster boy for Islamist Jihad?
A new bin Laden?
Oh, please...
You insult me by comparing me to these religious fanatics.
Oh, and you're not?
I'm a pragmatist.
A Pakistani patriot.
You disgrace your country.
I honor my country, as I always have.
I have no regrets.
Can you say the same?
I am not going to let this happen.
My will is greater than yours.
Then you know nothing of my will.
Mr. Laszlo, this is Major Sinclair.
Come on, guys.
What the fuck are we waiting for?
Return to base.
Still awaiting Intel on the second Target.
That was not our intention.
RICHMOND:
Okay, listen up...
I want you running scans on every subway station...
Mr. Laszlo, Colonel Grant cannot come to the phone.
Tell me, have you told Sergeant Scott that you framed him?
Does he know your role in Trojan Horse?
REPORTER:
We understand that an order has been given to evacuate all of the world leaders...
What's more worrying is that the entire area surrounding the explosion has been sealed off...
And hazmat decontamination teams have been called to the site.
(YELLING)
REPORTER:
Emergency services are asking people to stay inside...
and close their doors and...
We intercepted a local police radio call.
A VIP convoy was ambushed en route from the airport.
Ambushed?
That's strange.
I thought all the leaders had arrived.
They have.
So, who's this?

No power on bank one.

They've gone.
Shit.

Thank you.
- How the fuck did they find us?
- I don't know.
You don't know?
How convenient you don't fucking know...
Enough!
Christ.
I haven't betrayed anyone!
I haven't compromised anyone!
So if you want to beat some kind of confession out of me, you're gonna wait until there are no more terrorists running around this city...
With chemical bombs stitched inside their fucking bodies!
Fine.
Good.
(SPITS)
What do we got?
Well, the mainframe's fucked.
But the laptop should be able to hook up to London.
Let me help you.
The first terrorist only tried to detonate once he was confronted.
If it was just about killing people, he would have done it on the subway.
(SIRENS WAILING)
Laszlo.
STONEBRIDGE:
That tram was headed towards the palace...
Major Sinclair?
I demand to speak with your superior, right now.
She's not here.
As you can see, our unit came under attack...
Your unit has no mandate or authorization...
With respect, I have already stopped one suicide bomber in this town...
And we saved the lives of God knows how many people.
We think there's another, and he's on his way to the Palace.
So, please, either help us or get out of our way!
Is this your suspect?
Yes, sir.
Do you think you can recognize this man in the crowd?
Yes, I could.
(SPEAKING IN HUNGARIAN)
My officers will escort you back to the palace.
LASZLO:
We'll have tactical support.
Thank you.
Major.
What about the Colonel?
The terrorist threat first.
Besides, we have no idea where she is.
We do if she's with Latif.
How?
I put a tracker in his dressing.
Nice work.
Just getting a signal now.
Tura.
Thirty-eight kilometers from here.
Okay, Michael, you take the bomber.
Scott, you take the Colonel.
What the hell happened here?
Carnage.
By the way, Sinclair, you hit like a girl.
I don't know, he kind of hit you pretty good, didn't he?
It fucking hurt, buddy, but don't tell him.
Hey, Scott.
Yeah.
Bring her back.
Shall do, buddy.
(ENGINE STARTING)
(GRUNTS)
So what can you tell me about this man, Major?
RICHMOND:
Thank you.
We know that he's Chechen.
But we have no name, no date of birth...
Major, I'm sorry to interrupt.
Just before she was killed, Sally intercepted a communication between
Hungarian security and Pakistani intelligence.
It refers to the VIP convoy that was ambushed.
(CAPTIVE GRUNTS)
(GRUNTS)
The car that was ambushed, he was in it.
General Akmal Ramiz.
(WHISPERING) Akmal?
RICHMOND:
The Pakistani presidential candidate?
And our best hope of peace in Pakistan.
Latif... (GROANS)
Your invitation to the summit was not as secret as you thought, General.
You have John Allen to thank.
You endanger the lives of thousands with chemical weapons for one man?
As ever, Colonel, you see things so one-dimensionally.
General Ramiz is a liar, and a charlatan.
But this is not a mere abduction.
You are witness to a moment in history, and I am honored to have such distinguished guests as the two principal architects of Operation Trojan Horse.
Trojan Horse was only ever supposed to be an intelligence operation.
Falsifying the evidence of WMDs in Iraq made the case for war.
But the road to hell is paved with good intentions, isn't that right, Colonel?
Intelligence wasn't enough.
Which is where ATAT and the Pakistani military proved so helpful.
So the weapons were made and transported to be placed inside Iraq.
OFFICER:
Sergeant?
Comms are back on.
LASZLO:
Thank you.
Sir?
RICHMOND:
Scott?
What's your position.
(BEEPING)
ETA in 10.
RICHMOND:
Copy that.
Trojan Horse was necessary at the time.
We had to justify the action of our western allies to our own people.
This is ancient history.
But its relics survive.
It is those relics that I have sought and obtained, the very cache of VX that you intended to plant inside Iraq.
They were supposed to be destroyed.
The temptation to keep them was too strong.
However, ATAT didn't hide them well enough, so today I deploy them,
while the future of my nation is casually sealed over lunch by foreign imperialists.
And you grovel at their feet...
I came here to save Pakistan!
You want a craven Pakistan!
A Pakistan littered with American bases!
A Pakistan that would give away its nuclear weapons for an empty promise...
I am trying to preserve my country against extremist traitors who would tear it apart!
RAMIZ:
Traitors... like you!

POLICE OFFICER:
Right.
(OFFICER SPEAKING HUNGARIAN)
Move.
You are going to confess to Trojan Horse.
(SCOFFS)
Let the people of our country see you for the hypocrite you really are.
What do you hope to achieve?
The truth about these weapons will shatter your credibility, awakening a new Pakistan, a strong Pakistan.
Unafraid to use its nuclear weapons against its enemies in the west.
And why should I do your bidding?
...can't tell you who they are.
LATIF:
In that crowd, a martyr is ready to detonate a bomb containing your VX gas.
He is waiting my order to proceed.
Or, if you comply, I can call him off.
(SCREAMING AND SHOUTING)
They have to release this crowd.
Do you hear me?
I can't.
Not until all the delegates are evacuated.
They are my absolute priority.
Someone is going to get crushed to death!
You have to let them out now!
I'm sorry.
You will kill those people whether I talk or not.
Akmal, my men will intercept him.
We've already stopped one bomber.
You can take that chance, General.
But the question remains.
LATIF:
How do you weigh the lives of thousands against your cherished reputation?
What, you feel sympathy for this man, Colonel?
Placed in this terrible position by a monster like me?
The man who killed John Porter?
(GRUNTS)
PORTER:
I, John Porter, confess to the crime of being a British spy.
(GUNSHOT)
But you must have asked the question, who betrayed John Porter to me?
Why don't you tell her?
I would not lie to you, Eleanor.
His handler reported to me.
Porter was getting too close.
He learned that the weapons were a hangover from the operation.
Knowledge of Trojan Horse would have torn Pakistan in half...
You gave him to Latif?
I allowed certain elements within ISI to let his whereabouts be known.
(CHUCKLES) A politician's answer.
But perhaps we shouldn't be too quick to judge.
I saw Porter's last report from Lahore.
He told you he'd stumbled across Trojan Horse, didn't he, Eleanor?
But did you tell him what you knew?
LATIF:
Let's be frank.
Mahmood, ATAT.
You suspected the connection right from the start...
I...
LATIF:
But you hid it from your own section.
I tried to stop you.
But you only succeeded in helping me.
You didn't share your suspicions with the people who trusted you the most.
For what?
Your own ambition?
My only ambition has been to serve my country.
For the sake of your career?
Not my career.
Reputation?
Not my reputation.
Then why?
Because I was ashamed!
I was ashamed of what I'd done.
Then your shame killed Porter, and the others, as if you'd blown their brains out yourself.
Your silence meant the sabotage of your own mission, and with it you were my greatest ally.

You need to intercept further down the line.
Copy that.
SINCLAIR:
We have you on visual.
RICHMOND:
Target still on train.
Next stop, Batthyány tér.
You're thinking about Delhi, aren't you?
When we shook hands.
(ECHOING) When we shook hands.
And you gave me Mahmood.
You must long for that moment again.
It would have saved her life.
She had forfeited her life.
And what about Sergeant John Porter?
Captain Kate Marshall?
Are they just pawns in your game?
Pawns that you pushed into the centre of the board.
This will end today.
Finally, something we can agree on.
Target's off.
Batthyány Station.
STONEBRIDGE:
Yeah, copy that, we're en route.
(TYRES SCREECHING)
He's going down.
Go.
SCOTT:
I think I got a visual on target.
Looks like he's coming up the riverside exit.
Target visual.
In pursuit.
(TRAM BELL RINGS)
If you get a headshot, take it.
Negative.
I got no clear shot.
It's a fucking sardine can in here.
Where's that tram heading?
Due south.
Towards the palace.
Moving closer.
I might have a chance.
Excuse me.
Coming through.
Excuse me.
(WOMAN SCREAMS)
SCOTT:
Hey, hey, hey.
Shh.
Calm down.
Calm down.
Fuck off.
Fuck off.
Fuck off.
Move!
Move!
Move!
Get the fuck back!
Get the fuck out of my way!
STONEBRIDGE:
He's got a phone!
Drop it!
Drop it!
(BRAKES SCREECHING)
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
SCOTT:
Move, move, move.
(ALL CLAMOURING)
Lay down!
Move!
Move!
Get off!
Give me the fucking phone!
- What's happening?
- SCOTT:
Fuck!
Get out!
- Scott, Stonebridge, report.
- Fuck.
- SCOTT:
I think he's armed it.
Fuck!
- Oh, shit.
Get the fuck up!
Fucker, stay there!
Stay there.
Everyone get off the tram!
Now!
STONEBRIDGE:
I'm opening the briefcase.
(EXHALES) (UNLOCKS BRIEFCASE)
- How you doing, Michael?
- (STONEBRIDGE EXHALES)
Careful, Michael.
- It's fucking empty!
- Where's the fucking bomb?
Where's the fucking...
Where's the bomb?
Tell me!
Where's the fucking bomb?
Huh?
Where is it?
Where is it?
What the fuck is that?
STONEBRIDGE:
What?
SCOTT:
Jesus.
The bomb's in him.
SCOTT:
Get off the train!
STONEBRIDGE!
Get the doors, move!
Move away!
Move back!
Move!
(FIRING GUN) Everybody get back!
STONEBRIDGE:
Now!
Move!
SCOTT:
Shit!
Back up!
Back the fuck up!
STONEBRIDGE:
Scott!
Scott!
SCOTT:
Everyone back!
STONEBRIDGE:
Lady, back!
Back!
STONE:
Get away from the tram!
STONEBRIDGE:
Get away from here!
Scott, report.
Yeah, the police are gonna need decontamination units,
Hazmat suits, the works.
Is he using the VX?
Yeah.
It's nasty shit.
And you're okay?
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
Thanks for asking.
The explosion was contained within the tram.
No civilian casualties that I know of.
That shit is leaking out.
Hey, back up.
Back up.
- Are you at a safe distance?
- STONE:
Affirmative.
We're upwind.
This entire area needs to be sealed off.
All right, Mike.
Looks like the cavalry's here.
Let's go.
Scott, can you confirm how the device was detonated?
You really want to know?
It was inside the son of a bitch.
Alert the Hungarians.
Let them know what we're dealing with.
- Got it.
- There's no keeping a lid on this now.
We need to find that other bomber, and fucking quick.
(OFFICERS SPEAKING HUNGARIAN)
(PROTESTORS CHATTERING)
(IN HUNGARIAN)
Colonel.
The bomber triggered a device on board a tram.
Scott and Stonebridge managed to get everyone clear and contain most of the blast.
The device was carried inside the bomber's body.
It's been a potential terrorist M.O. For a while now.
A bomb in a cavity created by the removal of the spleen.
It seems Major Sinclair appreciates the measure of my achievement.
- It's an obscenity.
- Then it is just one of many.
- Thank you, Major.
- Colonel.
FEMALE REPORTER:
We'vejust received a report that there's been a large explosion in the city.
Now, we're all the way up here at the Buda Palace, and we heard a really loud bang.
There is still no indication as to what has caused that explosion.
But as you can see behind me, the riot police have been drafted in.
And they were quite calm, but now they are starting to get very, very anxious indeed.
Exposing innocent people to this poison is meaningless slaughter.
I'm not a nihilist, Colonel.
Everything I do has a purpose.
And what is that purpose?
If word of my presence here gets out, our enemies at home will undermine my presidential campaign.
And with it, our chances for peace.

- AIDE:
Yes?
- (CHATTER OVER PHONE)
- I'm sorry, sir, we have to turn around.

We've been given a new location.
Well, what is happening?
Some incident at the summit.
- Incident?
- (TYRES SCREECHING)
(SPEAKING HUNGARIAN)
(AUTOMATIC GUNS FIRING)
- (MAN SPEAKING HUNGARIAN) - (GUN FIRES)
No, please...
So what are you hoping to achieve?
Becoming the poster boy for Islamist jihad?
- A new bin Laden?
- Oh, please.
You insult me by comparing me to these religious fanatics.
- Oh, and you're not?
- I'm a pragmatist.
- A Pakistani patriot.
- You disgrace your country.
I honour my country, as I always have.
I have no regrets.
Can you say the same?
I'm not going to let this happen.
My will is greater than yours.
Then you know nothing of my will.
Mr Laszlo, this is Major Sinclair.
SCOTT:
Come on, guys.
What the fuck are we waiting for?
Return to base.
Still awaiting intel on the second target.
That was not our intention.
...running scans on every subway station...
Mr Laszlo, Colonel Grant cannot come to the phone.
Tell me.
Have you told Sergeant Scott that you framed him?
Does he know of your role in Trojan Horse?
FEMALE REPORTER:
We understand that an order has been given to evacuate all of the world leaders.
What's more worrying is that the entire area surrounding the explosion has been sealed off, and Hazmat decontamination teams have been called to the site.
Emergency services are asking people to stay inside, to close their doors and...
We intercepted a local police radio call.
Mmm-hmm?
A VIP convoy was ambushed en route from the airport.
Ambushed?
(GRUNTING)
Strange.
I thought all the leaders had arrived.
- They have.
- So who's this?
- Lost power on bank one.
- Lost comms.
Everybody down!
(GRUNTS)
(SCREAMS)
- Shit, you okay?
- Give me my gun.
- Julia, look, you're injured...
- I'm not dying without my fucking gun!

SINCLAIR:
Here.
Julia, you all right?
What happened?
Colonel.
Colonel!
They've gone.
STONEBRIDGE:
Oh, shit.
(PROTESTORS CLAMOURING)
Thank you.
- How the fuck did they find us?
- I don't know.
You don't know?
How convenient.
(GRUNTS)
SINCLAIR:
Enough!
I haven't betrayed anyone.
I haven't compromised anyone.
So if you want to beat some kind of confession out of me, you're gonna have to wait until there are no more terrorists running around the city with chemical bombs stitched inside their fucking bodies.
Fine.
SINCLAIR:
Good.
What have we got?
Well, the mainframe's fucked.
With a laptop, we should be able to hook up to London.
Let me help you.
The first terrorist only tried to detonate when he was confronted.
If it was just about killing people, he would have done it on the subway.
(SIREN BLARING)
Laszlo.
STONEBRIDGE:
That train was headed towards the palace.
Major Sinclair, I demand to speak with your superior right now.
She's not here.
As you can see, our unit came under attack.
Your unit has no mandate or authorisation...
With respect, we have already stopped one suicide bomber in this town.
We saved the lives of God knows how many people.
We think there's another.
And he's on his way to the palace.
So please, either help us, or get out of our way.
- LASZLO:
Is this your suspect?
- Yes, sir.
Do you think you can recognise this man in a crowd?
Yes, I could.
WOMAN:
Is struggling, but his condition is critical.
(SPEAKING HUNGARIAN)
My officers will escort you back to the palace.
We'll have tactical support.
Thank you.
Major, what about the Colonel?
The terrorist threat first.
Besides, we have no idea where she is.
We do if she's with Latif.
- How?
- I put a tracker in his dressing.
Nice work.
RICHMOND:
Just getting a signal now.
Tura, 38 kilometres from here.
Okay.
Michael, you take the bomber.
Scott, you take the Colonel.
What the hell happened here?
Carnage.
By the way, Sinclair, you hit like a girl.
I don't know.
He kind of hit you pretty good, didn't he?
Fucking hurt, but don't tell him.
- Let's go.
- SCOTT:
Yeah.
- STONEBRIDGE:
Bring her back.
- Shall do, buddy.
(GRANT CRIES OUT)
So what can you tell me about this man right here?
- RICHMOND:
Thank you.
- We know that he's Chechen.
But we have no name, no date of birth.
Major, I'm sorry to interrupt.
Just before she was killed, Sally intercepted a communication between Hungarian security and Pakistani intelligence.
It refers to the VIP convoy that was ambushed.
(GRUNTS)
SINCLAIR:
The car that was ambushed.
He was in it.
General Akmal Ramiz.
Akmal.
RICHMOND:
The Pakistani presidential candidate?
And our best hope for peace in Pakistan.
Latif.
Your invitation to the summit was not as secret as you thought, General.
You have John Allen to thank.
You endanger the lives of thousands with chemical weapons for one man.
As ever, Colonel, you see things so one-dimensionally.
General Ramiz is a liar and a charlatan.
But this is not a mere abduction.
You are witness to a moment in history.
And I'm honoured to have such distinguished guests.
As the two principal architects of Operation Trojan Horse.
Trojan Horse was only ever supposed to be an intelligence operation.
Falsifying evidence of WMDs in Iraq made the case for war.
But the road to hell is paved with good intentions, isn't that right, Colonel?
Intelligence wasn't enough.
Which is where ATAT and the Pakistani military proved so helpful.
So the weapons were made and transported to be placed inside Iraq.
SINCLAIR:
Sergeant, the comms are back on.
- LASZLO:
Thank you.
- Sir.
RICHMOND:
Scott, what's your position?
(TRACKING DEVICE BEEPING)
- ETA in 10.
- RICHMOND:
Copy that.
Trojan Horse was necessary at the time.
We had to justify the action of our
Western allies to our own people.
This is ancient history.
But its relics survive.
It is those relics that I have sought and obtained.
The very cache of VX that you intended to plant inside Iraq.
They were supposed to be destroyed.
The temptation to keep them was too strong.
However, ATAT didn't hide them well enough.
So today, I deployed them.
While the future of my nation is casually sealed over lunch by foreign imperialists,
and you grovel at their feet.
I came here to save Pakistan.
You want a craven Pakistan.
A Pakistan laden with American bases.
A Pakistan that will give away its nuclear weapons...
I'm trying to preserve my country against extremist traitors who would tear it apart!
Traitors?
Like you.
(BEEPING)
(ALL CLAMOURING)
(SIREN BLARING)
STONEBRIDGE:
I need you to get me inside this crowd.
SCOTT:
Right.
(IN HUNGARIAN)
You're going to confess to Trojan Horse.
(SCOFFS)
Let the people of our country see you for the hypocrite you really are.
What do you hope to achieve?
The truth about these weapons will shatter your credibility, awakening a new Pakistan, a strong Pakistan, unafraid to use its nuclear weapons against its enemies in the West.
And why should I do your bidding?
(REPORTER CHATTERING)
LATIF:
In that crowd, a martyr is ready to detonate a bomb containing your VX gas.
He is awaiting my order to proceed.
Or if you comply, I can call him off.
You have to release this crowd.
Do you hear me?
I can't.
Not until all the delegates are evacuated.
They are my absolute priority.
Somebody's gonna get crushed to death!
You have to let them out now!
I'm sorry.
You will kill those people whether I talk or not.
GRANT:
Akmal.
My men will intercept him.
We've already stopped one bomber.
You can take that chance, General.
But the questions remains.
How do you weigh up the lives of thousands against your cherished reputation?
(SMIRKS)
What, you feel sympathy for this man, Colonel?
Placed in this terrible position by a monster like me?
The man who killed John Porter?
(PORTER GRUNTS)
I, John Porter, confess to the crime of being a British spy.
(GUN FIRES)
But you must have asked the question, who betrayed John Porter to me?
Why don't you tell her?
I would not lie to you, Eleanor.
His handler reported to me.
Porter was getting too close.
He learnt that the weapons were a hangover from the operation.
Knowledge of Trojan Horse would have torn Pakistan in half.
You gave him to Latif?
I... allowed certain elements within ISI to let his whereabouts be known.
A politician's answer.
But perhaps we shouldn't be too quick to judge.
I saw Porter's last report from Lahore.
He told you he stumbled across Trojan Horse, didn't he, Eleanor?
But did you tell him what you knew?
Let's be frank.
Mahmood, ATAT.
You suspected the connection
- right from the start.
- I...
But you hid it from your own section.
I tried to stop you.
But you only succeeded in helping me.
You didn't share your suspicions with the people who trusted you the most.
For what?
Your own ambition?
My only ambition has been to serve my country.
- For the sake of your career?
- Career!
- Reputation?
- Not my reputation.
- Then why?
- Because I was ashamed!
I was ashamed of what I'd done.
Then your shame killed Porter.
And the others, as if you'd blown their brains out yourself.
Your silence meant the sabotage of your own mission.
And with it, you were my greatest ally.
(SPEAKING HUNGARIAN)
Come on.
Move through.
STONEBRIDGE:
I see him!
Get down!
Down!
Get down!
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
Get down!
- Don't shoot!

Look into the camera and confess.
Never.
I will not do your bidding.
(LATIF COCKS GUN)
- I'll do it, I'll do it.
I'll confess.
- No.
- It doesn't matter who says it.
- No, Eleanor, you cannot confess.
If you confess to Trojan Horse, you will destroy... (GRANT CRYING)
(CRYING) Oh, fuck you.
(SPEAKING CHECHEN)
No, no.
Don't look at them.
Don't look at them!
No, don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
You look at me.
(SPEAKING CHECHEN)
It's okay.
We're gonna let some of these people go, all right?
Go.
Go.
Now it's just you and me.
I need you to think.
It's a child.
It's a life.
(GIRL WHIMPERING)

Okay.
Sinclair.
Talk to me.
I'm going to pull out the detonator.
No.
Don't touch the det, it's on a trip.
Okay.
Okay.
Then what do I do?
Which wire do I cut?
You have to cut the earth.
Which colour is the earth wire, Sinclair, which one?
It's the one that leads to the battery.
- The brown one?
The brown one?
- Um...
I'm not sure.
Which colour is the earth wire, Sinclair, which one?
Wait.
(CHOKING)
Sinclair, the green?
The brown?
Tell me.

- Fuck.
- Green.

(KNIFE CLANGS ON FLOOR)

That's very touching.
But I'll probably just edit that out.
(GRUNTING)
GRANT:
Hey!
Colonel!
Damien, forgive me!
Colonel!
(GRUNTS)
Latif!
(INAUDIBLE)
Secrets are an occupational hazard in this job.
But I have kept too many for too long.
Perhaps the burden led to my mistakes.
But everything I have done, I have done for my country.
For my involvement in Trojan Horse, my failure to admit it, and my part in John Porter's death, I have nothing but regret.
To Major Sinclair, if you are still alive,
I wish you every success your doggedness and intellect deserve.
To Sergeant Richmond, for your camaraderie and your courage, I thank you.
Damien Scott, amongst my effects, there is a blue file.
I tried to tell you.
And to Michael Stonebridge, you are the finest soldier I have ever known.
Serving with you all has been a privilege and an honour.
Colonel Grant.
- Colonel Grant.
- Colonel Grant.
Colonel Grant.
What are you gonna do?
She did give me a second chance.
Guess I should be thankful for that.
You gotta make a decision, too, buddy boy.
Yeah, I know.
And?
I've already made it.
Well, fuck me. (CHUCKLES)
Who's gonna make me look good now?
Shit.
- Daddy Stonebridge.
- Yeah, I know.
- Up all night.
- Yeah.
Not for the good reasons.
- (STONEBRIDGE LAUGHS)
- Fuck.
Step aside, Major.
We'd all understand if you pulled that trigger.
But the lives of thousands of people are at stake.
Secure him.
Dress his wounds.
John Porter...
Blood.
Sit forward.
- Enjoy your stay at the organ farm?
- Actually, I thought the food was shit.
So I discharged myself.
We're secure!
Careful.
He's clean.
Sergeant Richmond...
All your training to do this... woman's work.
Sergeant.
We have a hit!
Target 2.
- Purchasing train ticket.
- Where?
Big screen.
Kobanya Station, south-east suburb.
- Satellite lock on Kobanya.
- Target's carrying a case.
Right, he's on the train.
Where's it going?
Arrives Nyugati Main Station in 12 minutes.
If there is a bomb in that case...
He'll need a trigger mechanism.
- Something like a cell phone.
- Remember we're dealing with VX.
- You will shoot to kill.
- Copy that.
- Is it just me?
- What?
Sinclair.
You gotta wonder about a guy that's step between a bullet and Latif.
A Cup Of Team
Tr: addic7ed
General Ramiz's announcement is expected...
Western leaders attending the World Security Summit in Budapest.
The stability of Pakistan which has nuclear weapons is high on the summit's agenda.
For us there, Jessica what's the late latest?
I report to you live from outside
Buda Palace as behind me, more of the delegates from the world's most powerful countries arrive
we suspect that Pakistan will be high up there on the agenda.
Along with the staggered withdrawal of Western troops from Afghanistan.
Now as you can see, a large crowd has formed...
- Anything on the other target?
- Nothing yet.
Whatever transport he's using, he's coming in under the radar...
And all the main delegates, they understand the need for absolute secrecy?
A discreet meeting room has been arranged as you requested.
Good.
About time, Colonel.
Recognize it?
Should I be invoking my human rights?
Oh, for that you need to be human.
Terrorizing a peaceful city makes you something else...
How does a civilized, intelligent man become what you are?
You know better than anyone, Colonel.
How many deaths have you sanctioned?
As you can see, we're tracking your bomber.
We have face recognition software on every CCTV camera in this city.
Impressive.
He will be caught, and he will be neutralized.
But if you thought there was only one, you would have killed me already.
Target has disembarked.
We have visual!
Target getting off train at Nyugati Station.
Copy that.
We're approaching the station now.
See anything?
We've got no visual.
Repeat, no visual.
Found him.
Target's boarding a westbound subway.
It's rush hour.
If he detonates down there, he could kill thousands of people.
He's heading under the river.
- {*You need to }Intercept further down the line.
- Copy that.
- We have no visual.
- Target still on train, next stop...
You're thinking about Delhi, aren't you?

And you gave me Mahmood.
You must long for that moment again.
It would have saved a life.
She had forfeited her life.
And what about Sergeant John Porter?
Captain Kate Marshall...
Are they just pawns in your game?
Pawns that you pushed into the center of the board.
This will end today.
Finally, something we can agree on.
Target's off.
Batthyany Station!
Copy that.
We're en route.
Going down.
Go...

Looks like he's coming up river side exit.

With chemical bombs stitched inside their fucking bodies!
Fine.
Good.
- What do we got?
- The mainframe's fucked.
But the laptop should be able to hook up to London.
Let me help you.
The first terrorist only tried to detonate once he was confronted.
If it was about killing{* people}, he would have done it on the subway.
Laszlo.
That tram was headed towards the palace.
I demand to speak with your superior{*, right now}.
She's not here.
As you can see, our unit came under attack...
Your unit has no mandate or authorization...
With respect, I have already stopped one suicide bomber in this town.
We saved the lives of God knows how many people.
We think there's another, and he's on his way to the Palace.
So, please, either help us or get out of our way.
Is this your suspect?
Do you think you can recognize this man in the crowd?
Yes, I could.
My officers will escort you{* back} to the palace.
- We'll have tactical support.
- Thank you.
Major.
- What about the Colonel?
- The terrorist threat first.
{*Besides, }We have no idea where she is.
- We do if she's with Latif.
- How?
- I put a tracker in his dressing.
- Nice work.
Just getting a signal now.
Tura.
Thirty-eight kilometers from here.
Michael, you take the bomber.
Scott, you take the Colonel.
What the hell happened here?
Carnage.
By the way, Sinclair, you hit like a girl.
- {*I don't know, }He kind of hit you pretty good{*, didn't he}?
- It fucking hurt,{* buddy,} but don't tell him.
- Bring her back.
- Shall do, buddy.
So what can you tell me about this man, Major?
We know that he's Chechen.
But we have no name, no date of birth.
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Just before she was killed, Sally intercepted a communication between Hungarian security and Pakistani intelligence.
It refers to the VIP convoy that was ambushed.
The car that was ambushed, who was in it?
General Akmal Ramiz.
Akmal?
The Pakistani presidential candidate?
And our best hope of peace in Pakistan.
Latif...
Your invitation to the summit was not as secret as you thought, General.
You have John Allen to thank.
You endanger the lives of thousands with chemical weapons for one man?
As ever, Colonel, you see things so one-dimensionally.
General Ramiz is a liar, and a charlatan.
But this is not a mere abduction.
You are witness to a moment in history, and I am honored to have such distinguished guests as the two principal architects of Operation Trojan Horse.
Trojan Horse was only ever supposed to be an intelligence operation.
Falsifying the evidence of WMDs in Iraq made the case for war.
But the road to hell is paved with good intentions, isn't that right, Colonel?
Intelligence wasn't enough.
Which is where ATAT and the Pakistani military proved so helpful.
So the weapons were made and transported to be placed inside Iraq.
Comms are back on.
Scott.
What's your position?
- ETA in 10.
- Copy that.
Trojan Horse was necessary at the time.
We had to justify the action of our... western allies to our own people.
This is ancient history.
But its relics survive.
It is those relics that I have sought and obtained, the very cache of VX that you intended to plant inside Iraq.
They were supposed to be destroyed.
The temptation to keep them was too strong.
However,
ATAT didn't hide them well enough, so today I deploy them,
while the future of my nation is casually sealed over lunch by foreign imperialists.
And you grovel at their{* feet}...
I came here to save Pakistan.
You want a craven Pakistan!
A Pakistan littered with American bases!
A Pakistan that would give away its nuclear{* weapons for an empty promise}...
I am trying to preserve my country against extremist traitors who would tear it apart!
Traitors... like you!
I need you to get me inside this crowd.
Right.
Move.
You are going to confess to Trojan Horse.
Let the people of our country see you for the hypocrite you really are.
What do you hope to achieve?
The truth about these weapons will shatter your credibility, awakening a new Pakistan, a strong Pakistan.
Unafraid to use its nuclear weapons against its enemies in the west.
why should I do your bidding?
... can't tell you who they are...
In that crowd, a martyr is ready to detonate a bomb containing your VX gas.
He is waiting my order to proceed.
Or, if you comply, I can call him off.
They have to release this crowd.
Do you hear me?
I can't.
Not until all the delegates are evacuated.
They are my absolute priority.
Someone is going to get crushed to death!
You have to let them out now!
I'm sorry.
You will kill those people whether I talk or not.
My men will intercept him.
We've already stopped one bomber.
You can take that chance, General.
But the question remains.
How do you weigh the lives of thousands against your cherished reputation?
What, you feel sympathy for this man, Colonel?
Placed in this terrible position by a monster like me?
The man who killed John Porter?
I, John Porter, confess to the crime of being a British spy.
But you must have asked the question, who betrayed John Porter to me?
Why don't you tell her?
I would not lie to you, Eleanor.
His handler reported to me.
Porter was getting too close.
He learned that the weapons were a hangover from the operation.
Knowledge of Trojan Horse would have torn Pakistan in half...
You gave him to Latif?
I allowed certain elements within ISI to let his whereabouts be known.
A politician's answer.
But perhaps we shouldn't be too quick to judge.
I saw Porter's last report from Lahore.
He told you he'd stumbled across Trojan Horse, didn't he?
But did you tell him what you knew?
Let's be frank.
Mahmood, ATAT.
You suspected the connection right from the start.
- But you hid it from your own section.
- I tried to stop you.
But you only succeeded in helping me.
You didn't share your suspicions with the people who trusted you the most.
For what?
Your own ambition?
My only ambition has been to serve my country.
- For the sake of your career?
- Not my career.
- Reputation?
- No{*t my reputation}.
- Then why?
- Because I was ashamed!
I was ashamed of what I'd done.
Then your shame killed Porter, and the others, as if you'd blown their brains out yourself.
Your silence meant the sabotage of your own mission, and with it you were my greatest ally.
Move through!
I see him!
Get down!
Down!
Get down!
Don't shoot!
Look into the camera and confess.
Never.
I will not do your bidding.
I'll do it.
I'll confess.
- Does it matter who says it?
- No, Eleanor, you cannot confess.
If you confess to Trojan Horse you will destroy...
Fuck you.
No, don't look at them.
No, don't shoot!
Don't look at them.
You look at me.
It's okay.
We're gonna let some of these people go{*, all right}?
It's you and me.
I need you to think.
It's a child.
It's a life.
Just give it to me.
It should have been my brother.
Put the phone down.
Give her here.
It seems for you the lies have been difficult to live with, Colonel.
So why don't you unburden yourself?
I am Colonel Eleanor Grant,
British military intelligence.
Thank you, Colonel.
There's something else I'd like to say, to my colleagues in Section 20.
Very well.
Shit.
Run!
Get out of here!
Run!
Run!
Fuck!
Someone's armed the bomb!
Get these people out of here!
Sinclair, talk to me.
- I'm going to pull out the detonator.
- Don't touch the det, it's on a trip.
Then what do I do?
- Which wire do I cut?
- You have to cut the earth.
Which color is the earth wire?
Which one?
- The one that leads to the battery.
- The brown one?
- I'm not sure.
- What color is the earth wire?
Which{* one}?
- Wait!
- Fuck.
Green?
Brown?
Tell me!
Fuck it!
Green.
Finished?
It's very touching, but I'll probably just edit that out.
Damien, forgive me!
Secrets are an occupational hazard in this job.
But I have kept too many for too long.
Perhaps the burden led to my mistakes.
But everything I've done, I have done for my country.
For my involvement in Trojan Horse, my failure to admit it, and my part in John Porter's death, I have nothing but regret.
To Major Sinclair, if you're still alive,
I wish you every success your doggedness and intellect deserve.
To Sergeant Richmond, for your camaraderie and your courage, I thank you.
Damien Scott.
Amongst my effects there is a blue file.
I tried to tell you.
And to Michael Stonebridge, you are the finest soldier I have ever known.
Serving with you all has been a privilege and an honor.
Colonel Grant.
What are you going to do?
She did give me a second chance.
I guess I should be thankful for that.
You gotta make a decision too, buddy boy.
Yeah, I know.
And?
I've already made it.
Well, fuck me.
Who's gonna make me look good now?
Shit.
- Daddy Stonebridge!
- I know.
Up all night.
Not for the good reasons.
Fuck.

Your... mother.
The funeral director was leaving her at the front desk.
He said that he'd tried calling.
Right.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
My own mum...
Are you labouring on the side?
No, no.
I've just moved into a new house on the Kinloch Estates.

What have we got?
Female, early 20s.
5'5", 5'6", 120 lbs.
Earrings in the shape of a crucifix.
I couldn't get a really good look but no sign of injury.
This is Mr Brodie.
He used to be in the police force until we got rid of him.
Well, maybe...
she probably topped herself.
Or killer pushes her in, waits for the tide to carry her out, but I get here too soon.
We don't know she was killed.
We need the RNLI, RAF, divers.
No, I can't just whistle up resources just like that.
You know the score.
You can, it's a phone call.
No, I can't justify calling in hardware on the basis of one sighting.
One sighting!
If they find something suspicious on the beach, or if a description of that missing girl comes up, fair enough.
Hey, she's out there.
Why did you bother coming down?
I'm freezing my arse off.
There's a girl out there who needs our help, and you come down here telling me I'm making it up.
It's unbelievable.
Why are you being so bloody unreasonable?
I'll do what I can.
Have you seen my watch, Richard?
What?
It's a gift from my agent, it's quite a nice one.

Ah, that'll be the twat from the venue looking to have a moan.

"He hashes up the same..."

You prick.
"He rehashes the same tired old material that he was using ten years ago." Hmm?
Bloody Scotsman, got it wrong.
Again.
Er, we said not in the house.
Your mate Dave Bell, he said that you were a good bloke.
Well, I don't know how he could remember.
I've only spoken to him a couple of times since we sat our O levels.
He said, and I quote, "Your time with Martin will be chilled out."
Yeah, and a good deal cheaper than a motel.
What, you want some rent?
Nah, course you don't, eh?
Because you're not that pathetic, are you?
Just joking.
Er, are you wearing my trousers?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Well, I pissed me own, didn't I?
Listen mate, you ain't got anything else besides beige chinos?
They're light chestnut, actually.
You see, the reason they're all like this, is because me, I'm just too sexy for them.
I attack the puritanical element.
That's the problem with this city of yours, mate.
It's got no libido.
Personally I blame Knox.
You blame John Knox?
Yeah.
I mean, think about it.
If this was Rio De Janeiro or San Paulo, well, it'd be totally different, wouldn't it?
Are you likely to play Rio?
I'm loving your book.
It'd be great if you could clean up some of this "stuff"
before you go to bed.
Here you are, look. "Something's up, Bertie," she... oh, she whispered, as she balanced on Bertie's shoulders to get a good view of Lord Carstairs in the palm-filled conservatory of Dunwrath Castle.

You're shit and you know you are.
Nice towel.
It's Marlee's.

Still going to New Zealand?

Never had you down as the arty type.
I've hidden depths.
Serious?
What do you care.
What's she like?
You've met her.
Briefly.
She's an actress.
Wow, you gave a better description of the dead girl.
I'll phone in a statement.
If she turns up, let me know.
But I'm working outside of the house today.
Yeah.
Because I've got a friend of an old school friend staying, and it's not a very good place to be.
Yeah.
Well, barring a few tweaks, I'll have it for you by the weekend.
That's fine, that's fine.

Cigarettes, keys.
Is he alright?
Push it on there.
Press it as hard as you can.
Don't be shy.
Can you breathe?
Yeah.
All right.
Well, keep calm until help gets here.
Call an ambulance and the police.
Are you all right?
You OK?
You OK?
Yeah, yeah...
He was going at him with a bat, and I threw my laptop at him and he stopped.
Yeah, I saw.
It was very brave.
Not a lot of people would have done that.
I didn't mean to do it.
What happens now?
You tell the police everything you saw when they get here, and they'll take care of it.
But no, the guy, he looked at me.
Suppose he comes after me?
No, no, you'll be fine.
Look.
You see?
Have a look.
Down there.
See that?
It's a red Honda, that's the number plate, all right?
You tell them that and everything you saw, and they'll take care of it, they'll catch him for you.
Wait.
You're a detective?
Yeah.
Then you can protect me.
You don't need protecting.
You should get yourself checked out.
No, no, no, look, I'm a writer.
I'm a writer.
I write crime fiction.
You can be like a consultant.
One second...
You could advise me.
That's not really what I do.
You should go to hospital with him and get yourself checked out.
You're in a bit of shock.
No, no, I'll pay you.
We'll see.
Well done.
Tony.
Thanks for calling me back.
Listen, I need your help.
Tidal movements.
Low tide was at 0440.
My question is this, if a body washed up at Cramond at 0700, then where might it have entered the water, and where and when might it wash up again?
Yeah, that's all right.
Don't call me back, I'll...
Where were you this morning?
That nine o'clock waited for over an hour.
I found a dead woman.
Oh, that's terrible.
Is she paying cash or credit card?
Your sympathy does you great credit, Deborah.
I'll remember that when I find you floating upside down in the Firth of Forth.
You will not find me floating upside down in the Firth of Forth.
That's right, you've got an art history degree.
Nothing bad'll ever happen to you.
If she's dead, she's not a client, it's a job for the police.
It's the living you need to worry about.
You're all heart.
Hi.
Hey.
No school?
No.
We are going shopping for summer clothes, aren't we?
Oh.
I went to New Zealand on my gap year.
It's amazing, you're going to love it.
Work, work.
Er, since we were already in town, I thought I'd get you to sign the form.
I've got a copy, thanks.
Yeah, I know, but... it'd be really helpful if you could just sign it now.
It'll only take a minute.
Well, I'm busy, and...
I don't think it's the best time to talk about it, do you?
I'll pop round tonight.
We're packing tonight.
Jackson, I've bought the tickets.
The house is rented.
We're going.
Look, all I need is your parental consent.
I know what you want.
You have to sign this.
I don't, actually.
No, I don't have to sign it.
For Christ's sake.
What you doing?
We knew that this was going to happen at some point, whether it was New Zealand or Newcastle.
I can get to Newcastle in a couple of hours.
I can take care of her.
You don't take care of her, I do.
Dad.
I could help if you're busy.
It's OK, I've got boring stuff to do.
Why don't you go out shopping with your mum?
You'll have more fun, all right.
OK.

Come on, let's go.

Awesome, as ever.

Dunno.
Er, my history essay.

I think you've got that wrong!
Look, I'm sorry, you're probably going to have to heat up last night's pie tonight, it's going to be a late one here.
I'm a neglected child, you know that?
And I'm a neglected mum.
I love you.
Yeah.
Nina looked up at the old house.
I say, Nina.
You're not seriously going to break in there?

A guy's been attacked with a baseball bat and taken to hospital.
Nasty head injury, apparently.
The assailant?
Escaped.
Great.
All right, in the meantime, make sure we've distributed the description of Jackson's girl as widely as possible.
Some of the guys...
What about some of the guys?
They say that Jackson bloke's a bit of a nutter.
Yeah, that Jackson bloke is THE most irritating man north of Hadrian's Wall.
That's what they said.
And a better copper than any of them.
Distribute the description of the girl.

I don't know what came over me.
I've never tried to save anybody in my life.
How's he doing?
He's still a little groggy, but he wants to be discharged.
I've got his bag.
It's really heavy, like it's got a brick in it or something.

Not really.

Oh, shit.
Er, right.
Do you mind?
Ah.
It's by a Czech writer.
Or maybe he's Slovakian.
Anyway, it's an existentialist, abstract piece.
Oh right, that means there won't be anything about Greenland or the equator on it then.
I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that it speaks to an audience.
Oh right, you care about audiences, do you?
Well, you shouldn't, because they're all bastards.
My first night, right, I'm on stage.
Belter, absolute belter.
Door opens, fat bastard wanders - waddles in, right?
You could hear the shockwaves in Leith.
Anyway, he's wandering down the side of the theatre like this.
I said "Oi, you corpulent pig,
"do you mind walking down the middle?
There's a bit of a tilt on the building."
I'm sorry I haven't had chance to come and see it.
How were the reviews?
Pff, I don't know.
Don't read them, do I?
Mind you, having said that, if I did, and if I ever caught hold of that bastard from the Scotsman, he's going to regret the moment that he learnt to spell banality.

Mr Brodie, it's Martin Canning.
The road rage incident?
Yeah, Martin.
How are you?
They're going to catch that bloke?
Er, probably.
I, er...
Listen, I need your advice.
The man who was attacked, they're about to discharge him and they want me to go with him and watch him for the next 24 hours.
It's a head injury.
They want to see if he's got brain damage.
Yeah, but I don't even know him!
Well, don't go then.
But I can't...
I don't...
The thing is, I write about a detective, an amateur sleuth... and I think I'm feeling sort of empathetic, you know, because you're a detective.
Well, as a detective, Martin, you've got to learn to follow your nose, you know.
So maybe go with him and, er, see where it takes you.
Ah, there you are, Martin.
Your friend's been discharged.
He's ready to go.
Myocardial infarction.
Massive heart attack.
I'm very sorry.
It doesn't seem like it's really Graham.
Graham's always talking.
Who found him?
Has no one told you?
Obviously not.
Perhaps we should move out of the room.
Graham may be able to hear.
I don't suppose you're telling him anything he doesn't know already.
A woman called Jojo, I believe.
Jojo?
A call girl.
She did try to resuscitate him.
A prostitute?
He might have revived quicker if he hadn't been... tied up.
Have you been married long?
39 years.
Sometimes I feel I went straight from being young to being old.
Missed out the good bits.
Och, they're all tossers, if you ask me.
Will he pull through?
I'm afraid I can't say at this stage.
We'll have to wait for the results of the scans.

I think "woman" is the term you're looking for.
Right.
She's wearing distinctive earrings.
Crucifixes with three bars across them.
Eastern orthodox, I think.
Where would she get them from?
Well, they sound a bit tacky.
I'm not interested if you would buy them, Deborah.

There's not a lot to do in the Maldives.
What does he pay you for, exactly?
Slapped hard, tied up, made to do things.
What sort of things?
Lick my boots, crawl on floor.
Nothing useful, like hoovering?
He likes to be submissive.

Same earrings, everything.
A dead ringer.
I'd swear it was her.
So is she dead or alive?

Sisters?
What's this?
I found it when I was looking for the body.
Half a name, FA, and half a number.
There were cards like this floating near the dead girl.
I get dozens of these cards through the letter-box.
She's not a man with a van, is she?
An Italian restaurant?
A dry cleaner?
Gardeners?
It's pink.
It's going to be a personal service of some kind.
She's Eastern European, so what do they do?
It's like massages, cleaning...
Well, I wouldn't know anything about that with the wages you pay me.
It's not going to be on there, it's local.
Go get all the local giveaways, anything with small ads.
Buy all the local papers.
And a latte.
When we've found her, on your way home and with your own money.
Really, Martin, you can get off now.
No, I couldn't forgive myself if you...
If something happened to you in a strange hotel room, away from home and family.
I'm not going to die, Martin.
Doctor said I had to keep an eye on you.
You can't sleep for another couple of hours, the doctor said.
I'm beat.
Then I have to wake you up every two hours to see that you're OK.
If you absolutely insist.
I'll take the chair.
Not many people like you around any more, are there?
So I've realised.
OK, have it your own way.
Fancy a drink?
Um... won't that make you a bit sleepy?
Not what I've got in mind.
Er, you probably shouldn't have any alcohol, not in your...
Whiskey and ginger.
First had it when I was stationed up here.
Were you in the army?
Sorry, I didn't mean to pry.
That's OK, I've got nothing to hide.
I was in the navy, actually.
SBS.
Now I'm just a desk jockey, pushing pieces of paper about.
It's very dull.
I'll just find some glasses.
There we go.
Try that.
All right?
Er, yeah, it's good.
So, have you served in the forces, then?
No, no.
My father was a CSM.
Brought us up in a sort of domestic boot camp.
Us?
Um, my brother and me.
Christopher.
Are you two close?
No, not really.
Shall I put the TV on, maybe help keep you awake a bit longer?
Tell you what, Martin, don't bother.
I'm done in.
Hello, darlink.
You give me a raise, yes?
Just keep working, will you, Deborah?
Hello, can I do you a favour?
You could stop trying to sound Welsh.
"Favours.
We do what you want us to do".
It's the FA.
It's what?
It's a slogan.
Favours is a cleaning company.
You were right.
Did you get an address?
That's the thing.
There isn't one, but the telephone number matches.
All right, you're calling in.
And saying what?
That your name is Olga, and you can't remember where you're working today.
What if they speak Russian?
You speak Russian, it's on your CV.
I went on a school trip to Moscow.
I'm not exactly fluent.
You mean you lied?
I'm sure this isn't in my job description.
Hello.
My name is Olga.
I forget where I clean today.
Ya, Olga.
Da.
Da.
Pravilno...
Da.
Thank you.
Bye bye.
Deborah, it actually physically pains me to say this...
What?
You did all right.
Seriously?
What about that pay rise?
Seriously?
Not that all right.
Udachi.
"Good luck" in Russian.
Tidy up.
Hello.
Who are you?
I just need to ask you a couple of questions.
It's all right, I'm not the police.
You have to phone office.
I will, I will.
Just help me out for a second.
Tell me if you know a girl who wears earnings like these.
I think she works for Favours.
You do, don't you?
When did you last see her?
I call owner.
Go.
Just tell me her name?
I don't know anything.
She's dead.
The girl who wears these, she's dead.
How do you know?
Did you see her?
Yeah.
I saw her, and I saw another girl who looked just like her.
Maybe her sister.
Expensive clothes.
Who would that be?
It's bad for me to talk to you.
I can see you're frightened.
Here, look.
My name's Jackson, Jackson Brodie.
I'm an investigator.
You call me later.
Anything that happens between us is private.
Go.
What's your name?
Please go.
Call me later, OK?
I need someone to come and help me pack.
Why does Dad work all the time?
People need him, I guess.
But we need him tonight.
Come on.
Jellybean.
Is that you, Mum?
What's that?
"Hello, Mum, how was your day?"
"Long and knackering, thanks for asking."
"Would you like a bucket of wine?"
"That would be wonderful, beloved offspring, thank you."
What have you been up to?
Nothing.
Is that Gran?
What's left of her, yeah.
Cool.
Can I have it?
KNOCK AT THE DOOR
For Christ's sake.
What the hell do you want?
This is my home, Jackson, it's not a bloody office that you can just drop by.
I think she was working for a company called Favours.
How do you know she worked for a cleaning company?
Because I was talking to a girl who was working there and she obviously knew her, I could tell.
Oh, you could tell.
She was terrified of speaking to me.
What was the girl's name?
I don't know.
Where does she live?
I don't know.
Do you have an address?
Yeah, I've got a phone number.
Oh, good.
All you've got to do is find out where they've got a booking.
Turn up.
Wait for the van to arrive.
What planet are you on, Jackson?
You didn't see how frightened this girl was when she was talking to me.
Trust me, it's a murder.
We don't even have a body.
Not even a reported crime, not even a reported missing person.
You're a police officer, aren't you?
You have statutory...
Don't you bloody lecture me!
I'm not saying you're not a good copper, you are.
I'm saying we should look further in a case like this.
Why don't you take a look at yourself?
Your daughter's flying to the other side of the world, and you're chasing shadows.
What's that got to do with anything?
Just get out.
I'm sorry I barged in here, all right?
I'm...
No, you're not sorry.
This is what you do, what you always do.
Christ, Jackson, you've lost your job, your wife and now Marlee.
And you will not stop.
Now, I want to help you, but you make it impossible...
Shit.
Let me clear it up.
Just leave it.
Who is it?
Get out.

You're joking.
What do you mean, Thurso?
What's he doing there, for Christ's sake?

He's building an estate up there.
'Since when?

'Why he's not answering his phone?

'Please leave me a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.'
Bloody hell, Jackson, where are you?
I've just sat through two hours of Richard Moat.
I'd rather have my fillings removed with a rusty nail.
Where are you?
I'm bored.
Oi-oi.
Hey.
There he is!
The man himself.
You were brilliant, darling.
I only hope mine goes half as well.
Yeah, you know, I thought it went all right.
I mean, it went really well.
You fancy a drink?
Yeah.
Why not?
Yeah, I thought the African village/water pump routine went down well, didn't it?
Niamh?
Niamh?
Niamh!
Jackson, no!
Jackson, no!
Have you got your lunch?
Yeah.
Take the whole pack.
Just don't get caught.
Thanks.
I should have picked her up from the bus stop.
You know that, don't you?
Yeah.
And you know I love you, tyke, don't you?
Yeah.
Piss off and learn something.
'I should have picked her up from the bus stop.

Francis?
Francis, stop mucking about.
Francis!
All right, big man?
There you go.
Started smoking again.
That's your bloody fault.
You're looking good.
I've just got older.
You should see Marlee, she's a giant.
I should have brought her to see you.
I will.
Yeah, I will.
You'd like her, she's...
She's amazing.
She's funny, she's smart, she's kind.
She's nothing like her dad.
They want to take her away from me, Francis.
They want to take her halfway around the world.
No.
I can't let her go.
I cannot let that happen.
You get it, don't you?
You've got to keep the people you love right there where you can see them, so you can protect 'em, eh?
Eh?
What do you think?
Oh, I'm so tired.
I love you, big man.
Archie, for the hundredth time, get up!
To think you were inside me for nine months.
To think you actually ever had sex.
So, what are you reading lately?
Bit of Japanese philosophy.
Only when I came home last night...
Who was that guy who came here?
Are you sleeping with him?
No, and don't change the subject.

DI Munroe.
Marcus.
Do we know who she is?
All right, I'm on my way.
I have to go.
There's been an incident.
Is somebody dead?
Jellybean needs feeding, with the special stuff.
You can manage that, can you?
If you get bored, talk to Gran.
She liked you.
She had no ID on her, but they think she might have been a prostitute.
Why?
There's evidence of recent sexual activity, Ã£40 in cash in her pocket, and it looks like she was a junkie.
It'll be an OD.
Although we won't know for sure until the toxicology reports come back.
Thought you might want to have a look before DI Tucker takes over.
'Jackson?
We've found another body.
'Jackson?
Are you all right?
' Yeah.
I'll see you there.
Oh, Jesus.
It's her.
The cleaner.
You're absolutely sure?
She said she'd get in trouble for talking to me.
There's nothing to indicate she was murdered.
Yeah, but you know she was, that's why you called me.
It's a double murder now.
Except we don't have a body for the drowned girl.
Don't.
I don't think Mr Brodie likes you very much, Marcus.
Right, you'd better find out where Favours is as quick as possible and turn it over.
You don't decide what we do, Brodie.
I do, though.
Go and find the cleaning company.
Ma'am.
I'm sorry about the urn.
My mother?
I wouldn't worry about it.
It's probably the most fun she's had in years.
You've not been home yet, have you?
Where have you been all night, or shouldn't I ask?
Yorkshire.
I went to see my brother.
And how was that?
Yeah.
He set me straight on a few things.
Hey.
Hey.
You said you didn't mind if I stayed over.
I don't.
Where have you been?
Can we talk about it later?
I'm intrigued.
My boyfriend stays out all night, and I'm wondering where he was.
Boyfriend?
Is that what I am now?
I thought you said we weren't a couple.
You said we were... what was it?
You and me, that's what you called us.
Lover, then.
That's what we are, lovers.
So?
So, can we talk about it later, please?
Come to bed.
I've got to go out.
What's so important?
Has someone died?
Or just said, "Help me, Jackson?"
I've got to go and see Marlee.
You have remembered my play?
You are coming?
Yes, of course.
Good luck.
Or break a leg, or whatever.
Jackson Brodie?
You've been making trouble.
You should have kept your nose out, son.
Stop!
Stop it!
I'm calling the police.
That's not right.
That's dirty behaviour!
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Hello.
'Louise, it's Jackson'.
Hiya.
I need you to go to Martin Canning's house.
What, the author?
'Yes, the author.'
How do you know him?
Because I think he's in danger.
Would you stop giving me orders?
'I just wish you'd do something I ask of you, for once,' as a favour.
I'll see what I can do.
Oh, bollocks.
♪ The world you leave behind you

♪ Every soul you loved will find you

I've been offered a job.
What?
New Zealand.
Marlee's staying with me.
Don't be ridiculous!
You can hardly take care of yourself, never mind her.
I'm going to allow you to buy me dinner.
I thought I was persona non grata.
You do look very good in a suit, Mr Brodie.
You begged me to spend quality time with your daughter, then you take her to work and put her in danger.
You blew it.
Happy birthday, love.
Niamh!
Niamh!
Niamh!
No!
Jackson, no!
Oh, DC Stewart, welcome.
Call me Marcus, ma'am.
Only if you don't call me ma'am.
What you got there?
Your... mother.
The funeral director was leaving her at the front desk.
He said that he'd tried calling.
Right.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
My own mum...
Are you labouring on the side?
No, no.
I've just moved into a new house on the Kinloch Estates.
Hatter Homes?
Ah, "real homes for real people."
Part of the bathroom ceiling came down on Holly, my fiancee, this morning.
God.
Is she hurt?
No, no.
Sorry.
Munroe.
Jackson Brodie?
Where?
What have we got?
Female, early 20s.
5'5", 5'6", 120 lbs.
Earrings in the shape of a crucifix.
I couldn't get a really good look but no sign of injury.
This is Mr Brodie.
He used to be in the police force until we got rid of him.
This is DC Marcus Stewart.
Has anyone reported a girl missing?
You OK?
Maybe she was drunk, fell in, but why would she come down here?
Well, maybe...
she probably topped herself.
Or killer pushes her in, waits for the tide to carry her out, but I get here too soon.
We don't know she was killed.
We need the RNLI, RAF, divers.
No, I can't just whistle up resources just like that.
You know the score.
You can, it's a phone call.
No, I can't justify calling in hardware on the basis of one sighting.
One sighting!
If they find something suspicious on the beach, or if a description of that missing girl comes up, fair enough.
Hey, she's out there.
Why did you bother coming down?
I'm freezing my arse off.
There's a girl out there who needs our help, and you come down here telling me I'm making it up.
It's unbelievable.
Why are you being so bloody unreasonable?
I'll do what I can.
Have you seen my watch, Richard?
What?
It's a gift from my agent, it's quite a nice one.
Ah, that'll be the twat from the venue looking to have a moan.
Reviews!
That's why I don't read 'em.
Yeah, good idea.
I never do.
"Richard Moat's humour creaks with banality these days.
"He hashes up the same..."
Hashes up?
Hashes up?
!
You prick.
"He rehashes the same tired old material that he was using ten years ago." Hmm?
Bloody Scotsman, got it wrong.
Again.
Er, we said not in the house.
Your mate Dave Bell, he said that you were a good bloke.
Well, I don't know how he could remember.
I've only spoken to him a couple of times since we sat our O levels.
He said, and I quote, "Your time with Martin will be chilled out."
Yeah, and a good deal cheaper than a motel.
What, you want some rent?
Nah, course you don't, eh?
Because you're not that pathetic, are you?
Just joking.
Er, are you wearing my trousers?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Well, I pissed me own, didn't I?
Listen mate, you ain't got anything else besides beige chinos?
They're light chestnut, actually.
You see, the reason they're all like this, is because me, I'm just too sexy for them.
I attack the puritanical element.
That's the problem with this city of yours, mate.
It's got no libido.
Personally I blame Knox.
You blame John Knox?
Yeah.
I mean, think about it.
If this was Rio De Janeiro or San Paulo, well, it'd be totally different, wouldn't it?
Are you likely to play Rio?
I'm loving your book.
It'd be great if you could clean up some of this "stuff"
before you go to bed.
Here you are, look. "Something's up, Bertie," she... oh, she whispered, as she balanced on Bertie's shoulders to get a good view of Lord Carstairs in the palm-filled conservatory of Dunwrath Castle.
You're shit and you know you are.
You're shit and you know you are.
Nice towel.
It's Marlee's.
How is she?
Still going to New Zealand?
And how's your actress?
Never had you down as the arty type.
I've hidden depths.
Serious?
What do you care.
What's she like?
You've met her.
Briefly.
She's an actress.
Wow, you gave a better description of the dead girl.
I'll phone in a statement.
If she turns up, let me know.
But I'm working outside of the house today.
Yeah.
Because I've got a friend of an old school friend staying, and it's not a very good place to be.
Yeah.
Well, barring a few tweaks, I'll have it for you by the weekend.
That's fine, that's fine.
Shit.
Yer swine, yer.
Sorry man, my fault.
We don't need to make a big thing out of it.
Yer stupid ballbag, yer...
I'll hold.
Eh?
Eh?
Eh?
No, no, no...
How you going to drive now, yer posh faggot?
No!
Hey, that's enough!
Here.
Just relax.
I'm fine.
Don't move, all right?
Don't move your head.
You've been hit.
Give us that.
What's that?
Cigarettes, keys.
Is he alright?
Push it on there.
Press it as hard as you can.
Don't be shy.
Can you breathe?
Yeah.
All right.
Well, keep calm until help gets here.
Call an ambulance and the police.
Are you all right?
You OK?
You OK?
Yeah, yeah...
He was going at him with a bat, and I threw my laptop at him and he stopped.
Yeah, I saw.
It was very brave.
Not a lot of people would have done that.
I didn't mean to do it.
What happens now?
You tell the police everything you saw when they get here, and they'll take care of it.
But no, the guy, he looked at me.
Suppose he comes after me?
No, no, you'll be fine.
Look.
You see?
Have a look.
Down there.
See that?
It's a red Honda, that's the number plate, all right?
You tell them that and everything you saw, and they'll take care of it, they'll catch him for you.
Wait.
You're a detective?
Yeah.
Then you can protect me.
You don't need protecting.
You should get yourself checked out.
No, no, no, look, I'm a writer.
I'm a writer.
I write crime fiction.
You can be like a consultant.
One second...
You could advise me.
That's not really what I do.
You should go to hospital with him and get yourself checked out.
You're in a bit of shock.
No, no, I'll pay you.
We'll see.
Well done.
Tony.
Thanks for calling me back.
Listen, I need your help.
Tidal movements.
Low tide was at 0440.
My question is this, if a body washed up at Cramond at 0700, then where might it have entered the water, and where and when might it wash up again?
Yeah, that's all right.
Don't call me back, I'll...
Where were you this morning?
That nine o'clock waited for over an hour.
I found a dead woman.
Oh, that's terrible.
Is she paying cash or credit card?
Your sympathy does you great credit, Deborah.
I'll remember that when I find you floating upside down in the Firth of Forth.
You will not find me floating upside down in the Firth of Forth.
That's right, you've got an art history degree.
Nothing bad'll ever happen to you.
If she's dead, she's not a client, it's a job for the police.
It's the living you need to worry about.
You're all heart.
Hi.
Hey.
No school?
No.
We are going shopping for summer clothes, aren't we?
Oh.
I went to New Zealand on my gap year.
It's amazing, you're going to love it.
Work, work.
Er, since we were already in town, I thought I'd get you to sign the form.
I've got a copy, thanks.
Yeah, I know, but... it'd be really helpful if you could just sign it now.
It'll only take a minute.
Well, I'm busy, and...
I don't think it's the best time to talk about it, do you?
I'll pop round tonight.
We're packing tonight.
Jackson, I've bought the tickets.
The house is rented.
We're going.
Look, all I need is your parental consent.
I know what you want.
You have to sign this.
I don't, actually.
No, I don't have to sign it.
For Christ's sake.
What you doing?
We knew that this was going to happen at some point, whether it was New Zealand or Newcastle.
I can get to Newcastle in a couple of hours.
I can take care of her.
You don't take care of her, I do.
Dad.
I could help if you're busy.
It's OK, I've got boring stuff to do.
Why don't you go out shopping with your mum?
You'll have more fun, all right.
OK.
Tonight!
Come on, let's go.
Can I get you something?
Hello?
Hiya, you OK?
School OK?
Awesome, as ever.
What have you been up to?
Dunno.
Er, my history essay.
On?
What the Nazis did for us.
I think you've got that wrong!
Look, I'm sorry, you're probably going to have to heat up last night's pie tonight, it's going to be a late one here.
I'm a neglected child, you know that?
And I'm a neglected mum.
I love you.
Yeah.
Nina looked up at the old house.
I say, Nina.
You're not seriously going to break in there?
There's been a road-rage incident.
A guy's been attacked with a baseball bat and taken to hospital.
Nasty head injury, apparently.
The assailant?
Escaped.
Great.
All right, in the meantime, make sure we've distributed the description of Jackson's girl as widely as possible.
Some of the guys...
What about some of the guys?
They say that Jackson bloke's a bit of a nutter.
Yeah, that Jackson bloke is THE most irritating man north of Hadrian's Wall.
That's what they said.
And a better copper than any of them.
Distribute the description of the girl.
Ma'am...
Boss.
Hello?
Gloria Hatter speaking.
No.
Sorry, there's been some mistake...
Graham's away at a work thing.
He's due back...
Oh, I see.
I'll be right there.
Feeling better?
Er, still a bit shaky.
That's adrenaline for you.
I hear you're a bit of a hero.
I don't know what came over me.
I've never tried to save anybody in my life.
How's he doing?
He's still a little groggy, but he wants to be discharged.
I've got his bag.
It's really heavy, like it's got a brick in it or something.
You seem familiar, Mr Canning.
Are you famous or something?
Um...
Not really.
I'm a writer, a novelist.
I do... what they call soft-boiled crime.
Alex Blake.
I've always wondered about writers.
Where do you get your ideas from?
Excuse me, you can't smoke in here.
This is waiting room.
When I wait, I smoke.
Then you'll have to do both outside.
Money or I scream.
Yeah, I'm going to go to the hotel lobby and get...
Jackson Brodie.
Hold on.
Where?
Yeah.
What time?
Can't you be more precise than that?
All right, no, thanks a lot.
Jackson?
What?
You said to remind you.
You're having lunch with Julia.
Oh, shit.
Er, right.
Do you mind?
Ah.
It's by a Czech writer.
Or maybe he's Slovakian.
Anyway, it's an existentialist, abstract piece.
Oh right, that means there won't be anything about Greenland or the equator on it then.
I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that it speaks to an audience.
Oh right, you care about audiences, do you?
Well, you shouldn't, because they're all bastards.
My first night, right, I'm on stage.
Belter, absolute belter.
Door opens, fat bastard wanders - waddles in, right?
You could hear the shockwaves in Leith.
Anyway, he's wandering down the side of the theatre like this.
I said "Oi, you corpulent pig,
"do you mind walking down the middle?
There's a bit of a tilt on the building."
I'm sorry I haven't had chance to come and see it.
How were the reviews?
Pff, I don't know.
Don't read them, do I?
Mind you, having said that, if I did, and if I ever caught hold of that bastard from the Scotsman, he's going to regret the moment that he learnt to spell banality.
You're late.
I'm sorry, I got caught up.
Jackson Brodie.
Hi, how are you?
Richard.
Richard Moat.
Yeah...
Comic viagra for the mind, eh?
Right, I'm off.
Get my head down, bit knackered.
Last night, first night with my new Thai bride.
Anyway, lying in bed there, you know, very intensive foreplay, just giving her a lovely blow job and I thought, hang on a minute!
Right.
So maybe see you both tomorrow.
Hilarious.
It's a wonder he's still not on telly!
Don't be cruel.
Where are you taking me?
Nerves make me ravenous.
I'm really sorry, I've got to duck out.
I found a girl drowned this morning.
I've got stuff to do.
I should probably rehearse some more anyway.
The journey through the birthing canal just isn't resonating for me.
Yeah, I hate it when that happens.
Nerves also make me very frisky, Mr Brodie!
Ten minutes?
I really can't.
Sorry.
I've got...
I'll call you later.
Jackson Brodie.
Mr Brodie, it's Martin Canning.
The road rage incident?
Yeah, Martin.
How are you?
They're going to catch that bloke?
Er, probably.
I, er...
Listen, I need your advice.
The man who was attacked, they're about to discharge him and they want me to go with him and watch him for the next 24 hours.
It's a head injury.
They want to see if he's got brain damage.
Yeah, but I don't even know him!
Well, don't go then.
But I can't...
I don't...
The thing is, I write about a detective, an amateur sleuth... and I think I'm feeling sort of empathetic, you know, because you're a detective.
Well, as a detective, Martin, you've got to learn to follow your nose, you know.
So maybe go with him and, er, see where it takes you.
Ah, there you are, Martin.
Your friend's been discharged.
He's ready to go.
Myocardial infarction.
Massive heart attack.
I'm very sorry.
It doesn't seem like it's really Graham.
Graham's always talking.
Who found him?
Has no one told you?
Obviously not.
Perhaps we should move out of the room.
Graham may be able to hear.
I don't suppose you're telling him anything he doesn't know already.
A woman called Jojo, I believe.
Jojo?
A call girl.
She did try to resuscitate him.
A prostitute?
He might have revived quicker if he hadn't been... tied up.
Have you been married long?
39 years.
Sometimes I feel I went straight from being young to being old.
Missed out the good bits.
Och, they're all tossers, if you ask me.
Will he pull through?
I'm afraid I can't say at this stage.
We'll have to wait for the results of the scans.
Sorry.
What profiteth it a man if he gaineth the whole world but loseth his soul?
Answer me that one, Graham.
Tosser.
Hi.
You're a girl, Deborah.
I think "woman" is the term you're looking for.
Right.
She's wearing distinctive earrings.
Crucifixes with three bars across them.
Eastern orthodox, I think.
Where would she get them from?
Well, they sound a bit tacky.
I'm not interested if you would buy them, Deborah.
Get us a list of jewellers that specialise in religious memorabilia.
I'm going to check out the Russian cafes.
OK, will do.
Oh, Jackson, how was lunch?
Jackson?
I'm Gloria, the wife.
I know.
Graham talk about you.
Before, during or after?
Not during.
Gag.
What?
Mr Canning?
Hang on.
Mr Canning?
Yeah, hang on.
I told you I was not to be disturbed.
Yeah, I'm a police officer.
DI Louise Munroe.
Well, in that case, my dear,
I am not Mr Canning.
My name is Richard Moat.
Comedy Viagra.
Well, I need to speak to him.
He's an important witness.
Do you know where he is?
Er, no.
Well, when you see him, can you get him to phone me at the station?
Urgently.
I certainly will...
Miss Piggy.
I don't have sex with him.
I am a lucky one.
I'm not a whore.
Last time Graham and I had sex was in the Maldives.
There's not a lot to do in the Maldives.
What does he pay you for, exactly?
Slapped hard, tied up, made to do things.
What sort of things?
Lick my boots, crawl on floor.
Nothing useful, like hoovering?
He likes to be submissive.
Powerful men, they're all the same.
Graham and his... friends.
The board of Hatter's Homes.
They're all at it?
The entire board?
Real homes for...
Real people.
Idiots.
Where's your accent from?
Russia.
My proper name is Tatiana.
I love your earrings.
Are you religious?
Faith?
You take it where you can.
This is not how I saw my life.
Me neither.
This was a surprise for you.
Well, yes, you could say that.
I always imagined him going on the golf course.
Well, not that he's actually gone yet.
Don't worry, Gloria.
He will soon.
You think?
Trust me.
Goodbye.
Hey!
Hey wait!
Any luck?
Yeah, yeah.
I saw the dead girl in the street, which is obviously impossible, but that's what I did.
Or very similar.
Same earrings, everything.
A dead ringer.
I'd swear it was her.
So is she dead or alive?
Or sisters?
Sisters?
What's this?
I found it when I was looking for the body.
Half a name, FA, and half a number.
There were cards like this floating near the dead girl.
I get dozens of these cards through the letter-box.
She's not a man with a van, is she?
An Italian restaurant?
A dry cleaner?
Gardeners?
It's pink.
It's going to be a personal service of some kind.
She's Eastern European, so what do they do?
It's like massages, cleaning...
Well, I wouldn't know anything about that with the wages you pay me.
It's not going to be on there, it's local.
Go get all the local giveaways, anything with small ads.
Buy all the local papers.
And a latte.
When we've found her, on your way home and with your own money.
Really, Martin, you can get off now.
No, I couldn't forgive myself if you...
If something happened to you in a strange hotel room, away from home and family.
I'm not going to die, Martin.
Doctor said I had to keep an eye on you.
You can't sleep for another couple of hours, the doctor said.
I'm beat.
Then I have to wake you up every two hours to see that you're OK.
If you absolutely insist.
I'll take the chair.
Not many people like you around any more, are there?
So I've realised.
OK, have it your own way.
Fancy a drink?
Um... won't that make you a bit sleepy?
Not what I've got in mind.
Er, you probably shouldn't have any alcohol, not in your...
Whiskey and ginger.
First had it when I was stationed up here.
Were you in the army?
Sorry, I didn't mean to pry.
That's OK, I've got nothing to hide.
I was in the navy, actually.
SBS.
Now I'm just a desk jockey, pushing pieces of paper about.
It's very dull.
I'll just find some glasses.
There we go.
Try that.
All right?
Er, yeah, it's good.
So, have you served in the forces, then?
No, no.
My father was a CSM.
Brought us up in a sort of domestic boot camp.
Us?
Um, my brother and me.
Christopher.
Are you two close?
No, not really.
Shall I put the TV on, maybe help keep you awake a bit longer?
Tell you what, Martin, don't bother.
I'm done in.
Hello, darlink.
You give me a raise, yes?
Just keep working, will you, Deborah?
Hello, can I do you a favour?
You could stop trying to sound Welsh.
"Favours.
We do what you want us to do".
It's the FA.
It's what?
It's a slogan.
Favours is a cleaning company.
You were right.
Did you get an address?
That's the thing.
There isn't one, but the telephone number matches.
All right, you're calling in.
And saying what?
That your name is Olga, and you can't remember where you're working today.
What if they speak Russian?
You speak Russian, it's on your CV.
I went on a school trip to Moscow.
I'm not exactly fluent.
You mean you lied?
I'm sure this isn't in my job description.
Hello.
My name is Olga.
I forget where I clean today.
Ya, Olga.
Da.
Da.
Pravilno...
Da.
Thank you.
Bye bye.
Deborah, it actually physically pains me to say this...
What?
You did all right.
Seriously?
What about that pay rise?
Seriously?
Not that all right.
Udachi.
"Good luck" in Russian.
Tidy up.
Hello.
Who are you?
I just need to ask you a couple of questions.
It's all right, I'm not the police.
You have to phone office.
I will, I will.
Just help me out for a second.
Tell me if you know a girl who wears earnings like these.
I think she works for Favours.
You do, don't you?
When did you last see her?
I call owner.
Go.
Just tell me her name?
I don't know anything.
She's dead.
The girl who wears these, she's dead.
How do you know?
Did you see her?
Yeah.
I saw her, and I saw another girl who looked just like her.
Maybe her sister.
Expensive clothes.
Who would that be?
It's bad for me to talk to you.
I can see you're frightened.
Here, look.
My name's Jackson, Jackson Brodie.
I'm an investigator.
You call me later.
Anything that happens between us is private.
Go.
What's your name?
Please go.
Call me later, OK?
I need someone to come and help me pack.
Why does Dad work all the time?
People need him, I guess.
But we need him tonight.
Come on.
Jellybean.
Is that you, Mum?
What's that?
"Hello, Mum, how was your day?"
"Long and knackering, thanks for asking."
"Would you like a bucket of wine?"
"That would be wonderful, beloved offspring, thank you."
What have you been up to?
Nothing.
Is that Gran?
What's left of her, yeah.
Cool.
Can I have it?
For Christ's sake.
What the hell do you want?
This is my home, Jackson, it's not a bloody office that you can just drop by.
I think she was working for a company called Favours.
How do you know she worked for a cleaning company?
Because I was talking to a girl who was working there and she obviously knew her, I could tell.
Oh, you could tell.
She was terrified of speaking to me.
What was the girl's name?
I don't know.
Where does she live?
I don't know.
Do you have an address?
Yeah, I've got a phone number.
Oh, good.
All you've got to do is find out where they've got a booking.
Turn up.
Wait for the van to arrive.
What planet are you on, Jackson?
You didn't see how frightened this girl was when she was talking to me.
Trust me, it's a murder.
We don't even have a body.
Not even a reported crime, not even a reported missing person.
You're a police officer, aren't you?
You have statutory...
Don't you bloody lecture me!
I'm not saying you're not a good copper, you are.
I'm saying we should look further in a case like this.
Why don't you take a look at yourself?
Your daughter's flying to the other side of the world, and you're chasing shadows.
What's that got to do with anything?
Just get out.
I'm sorry I barged in here, all right?
I'm...
No, you're not sorry.
This is what you do, what you always do.
Christ, Jackson, you've lost your job, your wife and now Marlee.
And you will not stop.
Now, I want to help you, but you make it impossible...
Shit.
Let me clear it up.
Just leave it.
Who is it?
Get out.
Hello.
'Gloria!
It's Murdo.
Sorry to bother you so late.
'I've been trying to get Graham on his mobile.
'We were supposed to have a meeting this morning, but he didn't turn up.
'Is he there?
' No, he's in Thurso.
'Thurso!
You're joking.
What do you mean, Thurso?
What's he doing there, for Christ's sake?
'
He's building an estate up there.
'Since when?
' Since now.
'Why he's not answering his phone?
' He forgot it.
'Graham forgot his phone?
' Hard to believe, I know.
I thought it was surgically attached to his ear.
See?
I told you he forgot it.
Some people have no manners.
Arse, arse, arse.
Memory stick, memory stick, memory stick.
Oh, my book, my book.
Surely not.
'This is Jackson Brodie.
'Please leave me a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.'
Bloody hell, Jackson, where are you?
I've just sat through two hours of Richard Moat.
I'd rather have my fillings removed with a rusty nail.
Where are you?
I'm bored.
Oi-oi.
Hey.
There he is!
The man himself.
You were brilliant, darling.
I only hope mine goes half as well.
Yeah, you know, I thought it went all right.
I mean, it went really well.
You fancy a drink?
Yeah.
Why not?
Yeah, I thought the African village/water pump routine went down well, didn't it?
Niamh?
Niamh?
Niamh!
Jackson, no!
Jackson, no!
Have you got your lunch?
Yeah.
Take the whole pack.
Just don't get caught.
Thanks.
I should have picked her up from the bus stop.
You know that, don't you?
Yeah.
And you know I love you, tyke, don't you?
Yeah.
Piss off and learn something.
'I should have picked her up from the bus stop.
You know that, don't you?
'
Francis?
Francis, stop mucking about.
Francis!
All right, big man?
There you go.
Started smoking again.
That's your bloody fault.
You're looking good.
I've just got older.
You should see Marlee, she's a giant.
I should have brought her to see you.
I will.
Yeah, I will.
You'd like her, she's...
She's amazing.
She's funny, she's smart, she's kind.
She's nothing like her dad.
They want to take her away from me, Francis.
They want to take her halfway around the world.
No.
I can't let her go.
I cannot let that happen.
You get it, don't you?
You've got to keep the people you love right there where you can see them, so you can protect 'em, eh?
Eh?
What do you think?
Oh, I'm so tired.
I love you, big man.
Archie, for the hundredth time, get up!
To think you were inside me for nine months.
To think you actually ever had sex.
So, what are you reading lately?
Bit of Japanese philosophy.
Only when I came home last night...
Who was that guy who came here?
Are you sleeping with him?
No, and don't change the subject.
DI Munroe.
Marcus.
Do we know who she is?
All right, I'm on my way.
I have to go.
There's been an incident.
Is somebody dead?
Jellybean needs feeding, with the special stuff.
You can manage that, can you?
If you get bored, talk to Gran.
She liked you.
She had no ID on her, but they think she might have been a prostitute.
Why?
There's evidence of recent sexual activity, £40 in cash in her pocket, and it looks like she was a junkie.
It'll be an OD.
Although we won't know for sure until the toxicology reports come back.
Thought you might want to have a look before DI Tucker takes over.
'Jackson?
We've found another body.
'Jackson?
Are you all right?
' Yeah.
I'll see you there.
Oh, Jesus.
It's her.
The cleaner.
You're absolutely sure?
She said she'd get in trouble for talking to me.
There's nothing to indicate she was murdered.
Yeah, but you know she was, that's why you called me.
It's a double murder now.
Except we don't have a body for the drowned girl.
Don't.
I don't think Mr Brodie likes you very much, Marcus.
Right, you'd better find out where Favours is as quick as possible and turn it over.
You don't decide what we do, Brodie.
I do, though.
Go and find the cleaning company.
Ma'am.
I'm sorry about the urn.
My mother?
I wouldn't worry about it.
It's probably the most fun she's had in years.
You've not been home yet, have you?
Where have you been all night, or shouldn't I ask?
Yorkshire.
I went to see my brother.
And how was that?
Yeah.
He set me straight on a few things.
Hey.
Hey.
You said you didn't mind if I stayed over.
I don't.
Where have you been?
Can we talk about it later?
I'm intrigued.
My boyfriend stays out all night, and I'm wondering where he was.
Boyfriend?
Is that what I am now?
I thought you said we weren't a couple.
You said we were... what was it?
You and me, that's what you called us.
Lover, then.
That's what we are, lovers.
So?
So, can we talk about it later, please?
Come to bed.
I've got to go out.
What's so important?
Has someone died?
Or just said, "Help me, Jackson?"
I've got to go and see Marlee.
You have remembered my play?
You are coming?
Yes, of course.
Good luck.
Or break a leg, or whatever.
Jackson Brodie?
You've been making trouble.
You should have kept your nose out, son.
Stop!
Stop it!
I'm calling the police.
That's not right.
That's dirty behaviour!
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Hello.
'Louise, it's Jackson'.
Hiya.
I need you to go to Martin Canning's house.
What, the author?
'Yes, the author.'
How do you know him?
Because I think he's in danger.
Would you stop giving me orders?
'I just wish you'd do something I ask of you, for once,' as a favour.
I'll see what I can do.
Oh, bollocks.

- I've been offered a job.
- What?
- New Zealand.
- Marlee's staying with me.
Don't be ridiculous!
You can hardly take care of yourself, never mind her.
I'm going to allow you to buy me dinner.
I thought I was "persona non grata".
You do look very good in a suit, Mr. Brodie.
You begged me to spend quality time with your daughter, then you take her to work and put her in danger.
You blew it.
Happy birthday, love.

Niamh!
Niamh!
Niamh!
No!
Jackson, no!
DC Stewart, welcome.
Call me Marcus, ma'am.
Only if you don't call me ma'am.
- What you got there?
- Your... mother.
The funeral director was leaving her at the front desk.
- He said that he'd tried calling.
- Right.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
- My own mum...
- Are you labouring on the side?
No, no.
I've just moved into a new house on the Kinloch Estates.
Hatter Homes?
"Real homes for real people."
Part of the bathroom ceiling came down on Holly, my fiancee, this morning.
- God.
Is she hurt?
- No, no.
Sorry.
Munroe.
Jackson Brodie?
Where?
- What have we got?
- Female, early 20s.
5'5", 5'6", 120 lbs.
Earrings in the shape of a crucifix.
I couldn't get a really good look but no sign of injury.
This is Mr. Brodie.
He used to be in the police force until we got rid of him.
This is DC Marcus Stewart.
Has anyone reported a girl missing?
- You OK?
- Maybe she was drunk, fell in, but why would she come down here?
Well, maybe...
she probably topped herself.
Or killer pushes her in, waits for the tide to carry her out, but I get here too soon.
We don't know she was killed.
We need the RNLI, RAF, divers.
No, I can't just whistle up resources just like that.
- You know the score.
- You can, it's a phone call.
No, I can't justify calling in hardware on the basis of one sighting.
- One sighting!
- If they find something suspicious on the beach, or if a description of that missing girl
- comes up, fair enough.
- Hey, she's out there.
Why did you bother coming down?
I'm freezing my arse off.
There's a girl out there who needs our help, and you come down here telling me
I'm making it up.
It's unbelievable.
Why are you being so bloody unreasonable?
I'll do what I can.
Have you seen my watch, Richard?
What?
It's a gift from my agent, it's quite a nice one.
That'll be the twat from the venue looking to have a moan.
Reviews!
That's why I don't read 'em.
Yeah, good idea.
I never do.
"Richard Moat's humour creaks with banality these days.
"He hashes up the same..."
Hashes up?
Hashes up?
!
You prick.
"He rehashes the same tired old material
"that he was using ten years ago."
Bloody Scotsman, got it wrong.
Again.
We said not in the house.
Your mate Dave Bell, he said that you were a good bloke.
Well, I don't know how he could remember.
I've only spoken to him a couple of times since we sat our O levels.
He said, and I quote, "Your time with Martin will be chilled out."
Yeah, and a good deal cheaper than a motel.
What, you want some rent?
Nah, course you don't, eh?
Because you're not that pathetic, are you?
Just joking.
Are you wearing my trousers?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Well, I pissed me own, didn't I?
Listen mate, you ain't got anything else besides beige chinos?
They're light chestnut, actually.
You see, the reason they're all like this, is because me, I'm just too sexy for them.
I attack the puritanical element.
That's the problem with this city of yours, mate.
It's got no libido.
- Personally I blame Knox.
- You blame John Knox?
Yeah.
I mean, think about it.
If this was Rio De Janeiro or San Paulo, well, it'd be totally different, wouldn't it?
Are you likely to play Rio?
I'm loving your book.
It'd be great if you could clean up some of this "stuff"
before you go to bed.
Here you are, look.
"Something's up, Bertie,"
"she..." oh, "she whispered,"
"as she balanced on Bertie's shoulders"
"to get a good view of Lord Carstairs"
"in the palm-filled conservatory of Dunwrath Castle."
You're shit and you know you are.
You're shit and you know you are.
Nice towel.
It's Marlee's.
How is she?
Still going to New Zealand?
And how's your actress?
Never had you down as the arty type.
- I've hidden depths.
- Serious?
- What do you care.
- What's she like?
- You've met her.
- Briefly.
She's an actress.
You gave a better description of the dead girl.
I'll phone in a statement.
If she turns up, let me know.
But I'm working outside of the house today.
Yeah.
Because I've got a friend of an old school friend staying, and it's not a very good place to be.
Yeah.
Well, barring a few tweaks,
I'll have it for you by the weekend.
That's fine, that's fine.
Shit.
Yer swine, yer.
Sorry man, my fault.
We don't need to make a big thing out of it.
Yer stupid ballbag, yer...
I'll hold.
No, no, no...
How you going to drive now, yer posh faggot?
No!
Hey, that's enough!
Here.
Just relax.
- I'm fine.
- Don't move, all right?
Don't move your head.
You've been hit.
- Give us that.
Cigarettes, keys.
- Jesus, you all right?
Push it on there.
Press it as hard as you can.
Don't be shy.
- Can you breathe?
- Yeah.
All right.
Well, keep calm until help gets here.
Call an ambulance and the police.
Are you all right?
You OK?
- You OK?
- Yeah, yeah...
He was going at him with a bat, and I threw my laptop at him and he stopped.
Yeah, I saw.
It was very brave.
Not a lot of people would have done that.
I didn't mean to do it.
What happens now?
You tell the police everything you saw when they get here, and they'll take care of it.
But no, the guy, he looked at me.
Suppose he comes after me?
No, no, you'll be fine.
Look.
You see?
Have a look.
Down there.
See that?
It's a red Honda, that's the number plate, all right?
You tell them that and everything you saw, and they'll take care of it, they'll catch him for you.
Wait.
You're a detective?
- Yeah.
- Then you can protect me.
- You don't need protecting.
- No, no, no.
- You should get yourself checked out.
- Look, I'm a writer.
I write crime fiction.
- You can be like a consultant.
- One second...
- You could advise me.
- That's not really what I do.
You should go to hospital with him and get yourself checked out.
You're in a bit of shock.
No, no, I'll pay you.
We'll see.
Well done.
Tony.
Thanks for calling me back.
Listen, I need your help.
Tidal movements.
Low tide was at 0440.
My question is this, if a body washed up at Cramond at 0700, then where might it have entered the water, and where and when might it wash up again?
Yeah, that's all right.
Don't call me back, I'll...
Where were you this morning?
That nine o'clock waited for over an hour.
I found a dead woman.
That's terrible.
Is she paying cash or credit card?
Your sympathy does you great credit, Deborah.
I'll remember that when I find you floating upside down in the Firth of Forth.
You will not find me floating upside down in the Firth of Forth.
That's right, you've got an art history degree.
Nothing bad'll ever happen to you.
If she's dead, she's not a client, it's a job for the police.
It's the living you need to worry about.
You're all heart.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- No school?
- No.
We are going shopping for summer clothes, aren't we?
I went to New Zealand on my gap year.
It's amazing, you're going to love it.
Work, work.
Since we were already in town, I thought
I'd get you to sign the form.
I've got a copy, thanks.
Yeah, I know, but... it'd be really helpful if you could just sign it now.
- It'll only take a minute.
- Well, I'm busy, and...
I don't think it's the best time to talk about it, do you?
I'll pop round tonight.
We're packing tonight.
Jackson, I've bought the tickets.
The house is rented.
We're going.
Look, all I need is your parental consent.
I know what you want.
You have to sign this.
I don't, actually.
- No, I don't have to sign it.
- For Christ's sake.
What you doing?
We knew that this was going to happen at some point, whether it was New Zealand or Newcastle.
I can get to Newcastle in a couple of hours.
- I can take care of her.
- You don't take care of her, I do.
Dad.
I could help if you're busy.
It's OK, I've got boring stuff to do.
Why don't you go out shopping with your mum?
- You'll have more fun, all right?
- OK.
Tonight!
Come on, let's go.
Can I get you something?
- Hello?
- Hiya, you OK?
- School OK?
- Awesome, as ever.
- What have you been up to?
- Dunno.
- My history essay.
- On?
What the Nazis did for us.
I think you've got that wrong!
Look, I'm sorry, you're probably going to have to heat up last night's pie tonight, it's going to be a late one here.
I'm a neglected child, you know that?
Yeah, but I'm a neglected mum.
I love you.
Yeah.
"Nina looked up at the old house."
"I say, Nina."
"You're not seriously going to break in there?"
There's been a road-rage incident.
A guy's been attacked with a baseball bat and taken to hospital.
Nasty head injury, apparently.
- The assailant?
- Escaped.
Great.
All right, in the meantime, make sure we've distributed the description of Jackson's girl as widely as possible.
- Some of the guys...
- What about some of the guys?
They say that Jackson bloke's a bit of a nutter.
Yeah, that Jackson bloke is THE most irritating man
- north of Hadrian's Wall.
- That's what they said.
And a better copper than any of them.
- Distribute the description of the girl.
- Ma'am...
Boss.
Hello?
Gloria Hatter speaking.
No.
Sorry, there's been some mistake...
Graham's away at a work thing.
He's due back...
I see.
I'll be right there.
- Feeling better?
- Still a bit shaky.
That's adrenaline for you.
I hear you're a bit of a hero.
I don't know what came over me.
I've... never tried to save anybody in my life.
- How's he doing?
- He's still a little groggy, but he wants to be discharged.
I've got his bag.
It's really heavy, like it's got a brick in it or something.
You seem familiar, Mr. Canning.
Are you famous or something?
Not really.
I'm a writer, a novelist.
I do... what they call soft-boiled crime.
Alex Blake.
I've always wondered about writers.
Where do you get your ideas from?
Excuse me, you can't smoke in here.
This is waiting room.
When I wait, I smoke.
Then you'll have to do both outside.
- Money or I scream.
- Yeah,
I'm going to go to the hotel lobby and get...
Jackson Brodie.
Hold on.
Where?
Yeah.
What time?
Can't you be more precise than that?
All right, no, thanks a lot.
- Jackson?
- What?
You said to remind you.
You're having lunch with Julia.
Shit.
Right.
Do you mind?
It's by a Czech writer.
Or maybe he's Slovakian.
Anyway, it's an existentialist, abstract piece.
Right, that means there won't be anything about Greenland or the equator on it then.
I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that it speaks to an audience.
Oh right, you care about audiences, do you?
Well, you shouldn't, because they're all bastards.
My first night, right, I'm on stage.
Belter, absolute belter.
Door opens, fat bastard wanders... waddles in, right?
You could hear the shockwaves in Leith.
Anyway, he's wandering down the side of the theatre like this.
I said, "Oi, you corpulent pig,
"do you mind walking down the middle?
"There's a bit of a tilt on the building."
I'm sorry I haven't had chance to come and see it.
How were the reviews?
I don't know.
Don't read them, do I?
Mind you, having said that, if I did, and if I ever caught hold of that bastard from the Scotsman, he's going to regret the moment that he learnt to spell banality.
- You're late.
- I'm sorry, I got caught up.
- Jackson Brodie.
- Hi, how are you?
- Richard.
Richard Moat.
- Yeah...
Comic viagra for the mind, eh?
Right, I'm off.
Get my head down, bit knackered.
Last night, first night with my new Thai bride.
Anyway, lying in bed there, you know, very intensive foreplay, just giving her a lovely blow job and I thought, hang on a minute!
Right.
So maybe see you both tomorrow.
Hilarious.
It's a wonder he's still not on telly!
Don't be cruel.
Where are you taking me?
Nerves make me ravenous.
I'm really sorry, I've got to duck out.
I found a girl drowned this morning.
I've got stuff to do.
I should probably rehearse some more anyway.
The journey through the birthing canal j ust isn't resonating for me.
Yeah, I hate it when that happens.
Nerves also make me very frisky, Mr. Brodie!
- Ten minutes?
- I really can't.
Sorry.
I've got...
I'll call you later.
- Jackson Brodie.
- Mr. Brodie, it's Martin Canning.
The road rage incident?
Yeah, Martin.
How are you?
They're going to catch that bloke?
Probably.
I...
Listen, I need your advice.
The man who was attacked, they're about to discharge him and they want me to go with him and watch him for the next 24 hours.
It's a head injury.
They want to see if he's got brain damage.
Yeah, but I don't even know him!
Well, don't go then.
But I can't...
I don't...
The thing is, I write about a detective, an amateur sleuth... and I think I'm feeling sort of empathetic,
you know, because you're a detective.
Well, as a detective, Martin, you've got to learn to follow your nose, you know.
So maybe go with him and, er, see where it takes you.
Ah, there you are, Martin.
Your friend's been discharged.
- He's ready to go.
- Right.
Myocardial infarction.
Massive heart attack.
I'm very sorry.
It doesn't seem like it's really Graham.
Graham's always talking.
Who found him?
- Has no one told you?
- Obviously not.
Perhaps we should move out of the room.
Graham may be able to hear.
I don't suppose you're telling him anything he doesn't know already.
A woman called Jojo, I believe.
- Jojo?
- A call girl.
- She did try to resuscitate him.
- A prostitute?
He might have revived quicker if he hadn't been... tied up.
Have you been married long?
39 years.
Sometimes I feel I went straight from being young to being old.
Missed out the good bits.
They're all tossers, if you ask me.
Will he pull through?
I'm afraid I can't say at this stage.
We'll have to wait for the results of the scans.
Sorry.
What profiteth it a man if he gaineth the whole world but loseth his soul?
Answer me that one, Graham.
Tosser.
Hi.
You're a girl, Deborah.
I think "woman" is the term you're looking for.
Right.
She's wearing distinctive earrings.
Crucifixes with three bars across them.
Eastern orthodox, I think.
Where would she get them from?
Well, they sound a bit tacky.
I'm not interested if you would buy them, Deborah.
Get us a list of jewellers that specialise in religious memorabilia.
I'm going to check out the Russian cafes.
OK, will do.
Jackson, how was lunch?
Jackson?
I'm Gloria, the wife.
I know.
Graham talk about you.
Before, during or after?
Not during.
Gag.
What?
Mr. Canning?
Hang on.
Mr. Canning?
Yeah, hang on.
I told you I was not to be disturbed.
Yeah, I'm a police officer.
DI Louise Munroe.
Well, in that case, my dear,
I am not Mr. Canning.
My name is Richard Moat.
Comedy Viagra.
Well, I need to speak to him.
He's an important witness.
Do you know where he is?
No.
Well, when you see him, can you get him to phone me at the station?
Urgently.
I certainly will...
Miss Piggy.
I don't have sex with him.
I am a lucky one.
I'm not a whore.
Last time Graham and I had sex was in the Maldives.
There's not a lot to do in the Maldives.
What does he pay you for, exactly?
Slapped hard, tied up, made to do things.
What sort of things?
Lick my boots, crawl on floor.
Nothing useful, like hoovering?
He likes to be submissive.
Powerful men, they're all the same.
Graham and his... friends.
The board of Hatter's Homes.
They're all at it?
The entire board?
"Real homes...
"for real people".
Idiots.
Where's your accent from?
Russia.
My proper name... is Tatiana.
I love your earrings.
Are you religious?
Faith?
You take it where you can.
This is not how I saw my life.
Me neither.
This was a surprise for you?
Well, yes, you could say that.
I always imagined him going on the golf course.
Well, not that he's actually gone yet.
Don't worry, Gloria.
- He will soon.
- You think?
Trust me.
Goodbye.
Hey!
Hey, wait!
- Any luck?
- Yeah, yeah.
I saw the dead girl in the street, you lnow, which is obviously impossible, but... that's what I did.
Or very similar.
- Same earrings, everything.
- A dead ringer.
I'd swear it was her.
- So is she dead or alive?
- Or sisters?
Sisters?
What's this?
I found it when I was looking for the body.
Half a name, FA, and half a number.
There were cards like this floating near the dead girl.
I get dozens of these cards through the letter-box.
She's not a man with a van, is she?
An Italian restaurant?
A dry cleaner?
- Gardeners?
- It's pink.
It's going to be a personal service of some kind.
She's Eastern European, so what do they do?
It's like massages, cleaning...
Well, I wouldn't know anything about that with the wages you pay me.
It's not going to be on there, it's local.
Go get all the local giveaways, anything with small ads.
- Buy all the local papers.
- And a "latte".
When we've found her, on your way home and with your own money.
Really, Martin, you can get off now.
No, no, no.
No I couldn't forgive myself if you...
If something happened to you in a strange hotel room, away from home and family.
I'm not going to die, Martin.
Doctor said I had to keep an eye on you.
You can't sleep for another couple of hours,
- the doctor said.
- I'm beat.
Then I have to wake you up every two hours to see that you're OK.
If you absolutely insist.
I'll take the chair.
Not many people like you around any more, are there?
So I've realised.
OK, have it your own way.
Fancy a drink?
Won't that make you a bit sleepy?
Not what I've got in mind.
You probably shouldn't have any alcohol, not in your...
Whiskey and ginger.
First had it when I was stationed up here.
Were you in the army?
Sorry, I didn't mean to pry.
No, that's OK, I've got nothing to hide.
I was in the navy, actually.
SBS.
Now I'm just a desk jockey, pushing pieces of paper about.
It's very dull.
I'll just find some glasses.
There we go.
Try that.
All right?
Yeah, it's good.
So, have you served in the forces, then?
No, no, no, no.
My father was a CSM.
Brought us up in a sort of domestic boot camp.
- Us?
- My brother and me.
Christopher.
- Are you two close?
- No, not really.
Shall I put the TV on?
Maybe help keep you awake a bit longer?
Tell you what, Martin, don't bother.
I'm done in.
Hello, "darlink".
You give me a raise, yes?
Just keep working, will you, Deborah?
Hello, can I do you a favour?
You could stop trying to sound Welsh.
"Favours.
"We do what you want us to do".
- It's the FA.
- It's what?
It's a slogan.
Favours is a cleaning company.
- You were right.
- Did you get an address?
That's the thing.
There isn't one, but the telephone number matches.
All right, you're calling in.
And saying what?
That your name is Olga, and you can't remember where you're working today.
What if they speak Russian?
You speak Russian, it's on your CV.
I went on a school trip to Moscow.
I'm not exactly fluent.
You mean you lied?
I'm sure this isn't in my job description.
Hello.
My name is Olga.
I forget where I clean today.
- "Ya, Olga."
- It's "da".
"Da.
Pravilno..."
"Da."
Thank you.
Bye bye.
Deborah, it actually physically pains me to say this...
What?
You did all right.
Seriously?
What about that pay rise?
Seriously?
Not that all right.
"Udachi".
- "Good luck" in Russian.
- O mesmo pra você.
- Hello.
- Who are you?
I just need to ask you a couple of questions.
No.
It's all right, I'm not the police.
- You have to phone office.
- I will, I will.
Just help me out for a second.
Tell me if you know a girl who wears earnings like these.
I think she works for Favours.
You do, don't you?
When did you last see her?
I call owner.
Go.
- Just tell me her name?
- I don't know anything.
She's dead.
The girl who wears these, she's dead.
How do you know?
Did you see her?
Yeah.
I saw her, and I saw another girl who looked just like her.
Maybe her sister.
Expensive clothes.
Who would that be?
It's bad for me to talk to you.
I can see you're frightened.
Here, look.
My name's Jackson,
Jackson Brodie.
I'm an investigator.
You call me later.
Anything that happens between us is private.
- Go.
- What's your name?
Please go.
Call me later, OK?
I need someone to come and help me pack.
Why does Dad work all the time?
People need him, I guess.
But we need him tonight.
Come on.
Jellybean.
Is that you, Mum?
What's that?
"Hello, Mum, how was your day?"
"Long and knackering, thanks for asking."
"Would you like a bucket of wine?"
"That would be wonderful, beloved offspring, thank you."
- What have you been up to?
- Nothing.
- Is that Gran?
- What's left of her, yeah.
Cool.
Can I have it?
For Christ's sake.
What the hell do you want?
This is my home, Jackson, it's not a bloody office that you can just drop by.
I think she was working for a company called Favours.
How do you know she worked for a cleaning company?
Because I was talking to a girl who was working there and she obviously knew her, I could tell.
- Oh, you could tell.
- She was terrified of speaking to me.
- What was the girl's name?
- I don't know.
- Where does she live?
- I don't know.
Do you have an address of the company?
- Yeah, I've got a phone number.
- Good.
All you've got to do is find out where they've got a booking.
Turn up.
Wait for the van to arrive.
What planet are you on, Jackson?
You didn't see how frightened this girl was when she was talking to me.
Trust me, it's a murder.
We don't even have a body.
Not even a reported crime, not even a reported missing person.
You're a police officer, aren't you?
- You have statutory...
- Don't you bloody lecture me!
I'm not saying you're not a good copper, you are.
I'm saying we should look further
- in a case like this.
- Why don't you take a look at yourself?
Your daughter's flying to the other side of the world, and you're chasing shadows.
- What's that got to do with anything?
- Just get out, Jackson.
I'm sorry I barged in here, all right?
I'm...
No, you're not sorry.
This is what you do, what you always do.
Christ, Jackson, you've lost your job, your wife and now Marlee.
And you will not stop.
Now,
Now, I want to help you, but you make it impossible...
Shit.
- Let me clear it up.
- Just leave it.
Who is it?
Get out.
Hi Graham!
It's Maggy.
- Hello.
- Gloria!
It's Murdo.
Sorry to bother you so late.
'I've been trying to get Graham on his mobile.
'We were supposed to have a meeting this morning, but he didn't turn up.
- Is he there?
- No, he's in Thurso.
Thurso!
You're joking.
What do you mean, Thurso?
What's he doing there, for Christ's sake?
He's building an estate up there.
- Since when?
- Since now.
Why he's not answering his phone?
He forgot it.
Graham forgot his phone?
Hard to believe, I know.
I thought it was surgically attached to his ear.
See?
I told you he forgot it.
Some people have no manners.
Arse, arse, arse.
Memory stick, memory stick, memory stick.
My book, my book.
Surely not.
This is Jackson Brodie.
Please, leave me a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
Bloody hell, Jackson, where are you?
I've just sat through two hours of Richard Moat.
I'd rather have my fillings removed with a rusty nail.
Where are you?
I'm bored.
- Oi-oi.
- Hey.
There he is!
The man himself.
You were brilliant, darling.
I only hope mine goes half as well.
Yeah, you know, I thought it went all right.
I mean, it went really well.
You fancy a drink?
Yeah.
Why not?
Yeah, I thought the African village water pump routine went down well, didn't it?
Niamh?
Niamh?
Niamh!
Jackson, no!
Jackson, no!
Have you got your lunch?
Yeah.
Take the whole pack.
Just don't get caught.
Thanks.
I should have picked her up from the bus stop.
You know that, don't you?
Yeah.
And you know I love you, tyke, don't you?
Yeah.
Piss off and learn something.
I should have picked her up from the bus stop.
You know that, don't you?
Francis?
Francis, stop mucking about.
Francis!
All right, big man?
There you go.
Started smoking again.
That's your bloody fault.
You're looking good.
I've just got older.
You should see Marlee, she's a giant.
I should have brought her to see you.
I will.
Yeah, I will.
You'd like her, she's...
She's amazing.
She's funny, she's smart, she's kind.
She's nothing like her dad.
They want to take her away from me, Francis.
They want to take her halfway around the world.
No.
I can't let her go.
I cannot let that happen.
You get it, don't you?
You've got to keep the people you love right there where you can see them, so you can protect 'em, eh?
Eh?
What do you think?
I'm so tired.
I love you, big man.
Archie, for the hundredth time, get up!
To think you were inside me for nine months.
To think you actually ever had sex.
So, what are you reading lately?
Bit of Japanese philosophy.
Only when I came home last night...
Who was that guy who came here?
Are you sleeping with him?
No, and don't change the subject.
DI Munroe.
Marcus.
Right.
Do we know who she is?
All right, I'm on my way.
I have to go.
- There's been an incident.
- Is somebody dead?
Jellybean needs feeding, with the special stuff.
You can manage that, can you?
If you get bored, talk to Gran.
She liked you.
She had no ID on her, but they think she might have been a prostitute.
Why?
There's evidence of recent sexual activity,
£40 in cash in her pocket, and it looks like she was a junkie.
It'll be an OD.
Although we won't know for sure until the toxicology reports come back.
Thought you might want to have a look before DI Tucker takes over.
Jackson?
We've found another body.
Jackson?
Are you all right?
Yeah.
I'll see you there.
Jesus.
It's her.
- The cleaner.
- Yeah.
You're absolutely sure?
She said she'd get in trouble for talking to me.
There's nothing to indicate she was murdered.
Yeah, but you know she was, that's why you called me.
It's a double murder now.
Except we don't have a body for the drowned girl.
Don't.
I don't think Mr. Brodie likes you very much, Marcus.
Right, you'd better find out where Favours is as quick as possible and turn it over.
You don't decide what we do, Brodie.
I do, though.
Go and find the cleaning company.
Ma'am.
I'm sorry about the urn.
My mother?
I wouldn't worry about it.
It's probably the most fun she's had in years.
You've not been home yet, have you?
Where have you been all night, or shouldn't I ask?
Yorkshire.
I went to see my brother.
And how was that?
Yeah.
He set me straight on a few things.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You said you didn't mind if I stayed over.
- I don't.
- Where have you been?
Can we talk about it later?
I'm intrigued.
My boyfriend stays out all night, and I'm wondering where he was.
Boyfriend?
Is that what I am now?
I thought you said we weren't a couple.
You said we were... what was it?
You and me, that's what you called us.
Lover, then.
That's what we are, lovers.
So?
So, can we talk about it later, please?
Come to bed.
- I've got to go out.
- What's so important?
Has someone died?
Or just said, "Help me, Jackson?"
I've got to go and see Marlee.
You have remembered my play?
You are coming?
Yes, of course.
Good luck.
Or break a leg, or whatever.
Jackson Brodie?
You've been making trouble.
You should have kept your nose out, son.
Stop!
Stop it!
I'm calling the police.
That's not right.
That's dirty behaviour!
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
- Hello.
- Louise, it's Jackson.
- Hiya.
- I need you to go to
Martin Canning's house.
- What, the author?
- Yes, the author.
How do you know him?
Because I think he's in danger.
Would you stop giving me orders?
I just wish you'd do something I ask of you, for once, as a favour.
I'll see what I can do.
Martin?
Bollocks.

Don't prod the pomegranate inside me I'm wearing a white shirt...
Birhan Keskin
You were sleeping so sweetly.
What an angel.
call you later.
- Morning.
- Morning, Mustafa.
How's things?
Fine, AbIa. I sent the wife and boy back to the village for a few days.
- Herfather's not too well.
- Sorry to hearthat.
Those guys downstairs have gone off and left the dog at home.
The animal's been howling non- stop since yesterday.
OK, have a good day.
Ah, it's my director!
hello?
I'm fantastic.
How are you?
Oh no, are you serious?
I hope you're over it soon.
In that case..
The rehearsal's off then.
OK, I'lI wait to hear from you.
Get well soon.
Who are you looking for?
.
Dr Sema Hanim.
Kurucesme Avenue No 85, flat Three.
- What do you want with Sema Hanim?
- I have an appointment.
An appointment.
But Dr Sema Hanim doesn't see patients at home.
I'm not a patient.
It's a private appointment.
Go up three floors.
- Who is it?
- Me..
Asuman.
Asuman?
We made an appointment.
Dr Sema Hanim?
It's the right address, isn't it?
We said Thursday morning at 10.00.
You said it was your day off.
- What was it about?
- Yourfortune.
Having yourfortune told.
I'm Asuman..
GuIer Hanim's fortune-telIer.
- GuIer Hanim gave you my number.
- GuIer?
GuIer the lawyer?
Oh, right.
Fortune-teIling..
Yes.
Come in, come in.
Forgive me.
You needn't have taken them off.
Whatever..
There, go through.
- The weather's so gloomy today.
- Aha.
- It gets to a person.
- Yes.
And I came out as I am, without an umbrella.
Does Guler have you tell herfortune regularly?
She calls at least once a month.
She's very pleased with me.
And she was nice enough to tell you about me.
Have a seat.
I've kept you standing.
Forgive me..
I forgot you were coming.
- I was about to go out.
- That's only natural.
Doctors have a lot on their minds.
It's a very hard job.
Speaking for myself, I couId never have been a doctor.
I don't have the brains anyway.
But you tell fortunes.
You've even convinced GuIer Hanim.
GuIer believes in nothing she can't actually see.
She's a total positivist.
Posi..
What?
Forget it.
I mean, you do a great job telling fortunes.
I wouldn't know.
It's not like I tell fortunes.
How do you mean?
I don't tell fortunes.
I see things.
I don't understand what I see either.
Two years ago they came to me.
I was really down.
I started seeing shapes and things.
I Iook at something.
It could be anything.
A puddle..
A patch of damp on the wall..
Clouds..
Even those pomegranates there.
Say a bag goes missing, I'Il sense where it is.
Pardon me forsaying so, but if there's cheating in a marriage I'Il pick up the smell like it was freshly cut melon.
A voice whispers in my ear:
tulip, tulip..
Along with a number.
And there, out comes the address of the man's secret love nest.
Tulip Street.
The wives are grateful.
That's how I came to be known in lstanbul. lt's worked out well.
There's an imam in our neighbourhood.
Even his wife came to me.
She said it was a sin though.
I told her it was no sin.
My thing isn't fortune- telling.
I don't tell fortunes.
You tell your fortune yourself.
I just say what's echoing in my ear and you make sense of it.
There, I'm a bit cuckoo.
- Would you Iike coffee?
- lf it's no trouble.
But not your pozi- thing coffee.
If we're to read your coffee cup, we need proper Turkish coffee.
- l can't make Turkish coffee.
- Let me do it, if it's OK by you.
Besides, my touch is needed forthe grinds to be readable.
Then I met Guler Hanim, the lawyer.
She's a mighty troubled lady.
When she mentioned you and said would I go to you I said of course.
I hear from GuIer Hanim you've never had your fortune told.
The hardest jobs in the world are the most simple ones.
What's so hard about brewing coffee?
well, getting it just right.
If you put in too little coffee, the grinds won't stick to the cup.
And if you put in too much, it clouds over yourfortune.
Everything has its measure.
But on the finest scale.
How are you doing, darling?
I'm good.
Didn't get up till late.
Sure, I guessed it was an emergency.
Me?
..
Nothing.
Just hanging out at home.
No, the rehearsal's off.
I have nothing on all day.
I don't feel like going out in this weather.
I'm about to have coffee.
Listen, do you believe in fortune- telling?
I don't know, any kind.
Coffee cups, playing cards..
No reason.
It just came to mind.
OK, anyway, forget it.
When will you be done at work?
OK, whenever.
I'Il be home the whole time.
Don't work too hard.
See you later.
I guess you're married.
Yes.
But I'm as good as widowed.
My husband's been bedridden for 12 years.
I have a daughter.
And a grandchild.
Or I had one.
We lost her.
We almost lost my daughter too.
Anyway, she pulled through.
Sorry to hear it.
Must be hard.
Very hard.
Very hard.
Is something wrong?
No, it's passed.
They were just passing.
It happens.
Who was passing?
On calm, quiet nights the wind suddenly blows through the leaves on the trees.
As though the tree is talking..
Whispering..
Our imam's wife calls them djinns.
You're dalIying with djinns, she says.
No good comes of their talk, she says.
But then she comes to see me.
It's hard to explain.
They don't speak the language of this world.
It can't even be called speaking.
I just sense it.
well, what did they just say?
The djinns.
Never mind.
Don't be afraid.
It's blown over.
This has to get cold, right?
Let me run and get some clothes on.
Here you are and I'm not even dressed.
- lt doesn't matter.
- l'Il be right back.
Is it done?
Yes.
I was going to say..
I've never had my fortune told.
This will be a first.
I don't have much cash on me.
What do you charge?
GuIer didn't say.
Whatever you feel like.
But there must be a going rate.
Is it 50, 100?
Three hundred?
really, I have no idea.
If you don't have it now...
It can wait till next time.
I guess people you see get addicted.
You're very sure of yourself.
There was a star above you.
It's gone now.
- What?
- A star.
It was hanging above your head, but it's gone now.
- But how could you know?
- What?
About the star.
The starfish.
I was very young.
My dad caught a huge starfish in Bodrum.
This big.
We dried it in the sun.
Of course, it shrank a bit in drying.
We brought it back to Istanbul and hung it in my bedroom.
For years it hung there by my bed, just above my head, right here.
I was home the other day.
The damp had got to it.
Mum had thrown it out.
But how could you know that?
You mean stars can be fish?
Sure.
They're a kind of sea animal.
Starfishes.
I've never heard of them.
Neverseen one.
- Have you never been to the sea?
- Never.
I don't like the sea.
Stars orwhat have you.
I don't like fish either.
Haven't you seen them on TV either?
In documentaries orwhatever?
.
Here, that's what they're like.
Ours was bigger, of course.
- Are you OK?
- Yes, fine.
I suddenly felt dizzy.
I guess I overdid it with the wine last night.
hopefully you enjoyed it.
Don't coffee cup readers take a more classic line?
I don't know..
You have a heavy heart, say.
Or, there's a wish inside you.
It'lI come true by the third count.
Your head's full of crooked writing.
Like it's carved in clay.
- You have to be kidding!
- What's wrong?
- It's Sumerian.
- What?
I studied Sumerian at university.
For a year or two.
Before medicine.
When my mind wasn't made up.
Do they write differently from us?
The Sumerians were a people who lived thousands of years ago in Mesopotamia.
They died out long ago.
- So no one speaks their language.
- No, it's a dead language.
Why would anyone want to learn the language of the dead?
well, you've learned the language of djinns, right?
I haven't learned it.
It just happened.
My parents are both teachers.
When I got a place at university to read Sumerian, they were livid.
They thought I'd never get a job.
typical civil servant mentality.
In the end, I had to go for medicine.
But seriously, I can't get over it.
Two out of two..
Spot on.
How do you do it?
Or did GuIer tell you?
- Gulertold you for sure, huh?
- Dr Sema Hanim, I don't tell lies.
I don't sound you out like some trouble- making spy.
I say what I feel that moment, what I see.
No monkey business.
OK, OK.
What else do you feel?
There's a woman.
She's holding a heart in her hand.
- That woman isn't you.
- Whose is the heart?
- Yours.
- So if she squeezes it, I'm dead.
There's a giant black butterfly on her neck.
A black lie butterfly.
The woman holding the heart..
If the heart is yours she's told a Iot of lies.
She's lied to you as weIl.
Don't you see anything good for me?
No.
Darkness.
only darkness.
- Murder..
- Hey, what are you saying?
Oh, precious.
You're so pretty, so well- mannered.
Could you really be a killer?
.
What is this?
The djinns talking again?
If someone came to me and said, "My grandchild is dead."
"My daughter almost died too.
She was saved at the Iast minute..."
...I'd ask them what happened.
I'd wonder.
I'd ask.
Everyone would.
- You didn't ask.
- What does that mean?
Wouldn't a person wonder?
WouIdn't they ask?
OK, forget the fortune- telling.
I can't handle working- class weirdoes...
My legs don't work.
My legs don't work.
Don't worry, it won't kill you.
Fuck!
How could I be so fucking stupid?
It's like a dream.
You want to shout, except no sound comes out.
But you aren't in a dream now.
calm down.
Look, there's nothing valuable here.
My purse is in the bedroom.
There's 250 lira in it.
That's all.
Take the lot, just don't touch me!
Sema Hanim, don't talk rubbish.
I'm not a thief.
Stop!
Don't close the blinds.
The neighbours are so close.
Drugs?
You drugged me?
Just calm down, Abla, and I'Il explain everything.
Abla, huh?
What do you want, freak?
You drugged me!
You drugged me!
Yes, I drugged you!
Just be quiet and listen!
It's your drug, this.
I paid an orderly 200 lira for it at your hospital.
Try as you Iike, you won't be able to move for an hour or two.
You want me to tell your pomegranate fortune?
'Sweetheart'..
It's your sweetheart calling.
He'lI have to wait a bit.
What do you want from me?
What do you want?
There's no money here.
No gold.
Look if you like.
Take whatever you want and go.
Just don't touch me.
I'm not after your money.
How many times do I have to tell you?
What do you want then?
What have I done to you?
Nothing.
My grandchild and daughter..
What happened, happened to them.
I don't know you.
I've never met you before now.
Why would I care about your grandchild and daughter?
I have a child, my daughter, SeIin.
My only child.
Selin was my first child.
Then something happened.
I couldn't have any more children.
I went hungry to feed her, went without clothes to clothe her.
She even went to university.
She became an accountant.
She has a career and a husband.
Her life is quite different from the neighbourhood girls.
I brought up my girl on my own.
I went cleaning for the rich.
I wasn't fortune- telling then either.
I worked my backside off, all alone.
Listen to me, Dr Sema.
Pay attention.
I came so you'd listen to me.
My Selin had a child too.
Menekse.
A little girl, pretty as a doll.
Just two months old.
One night she broke out in a fever.
We took her to hospital.
They kept her in and gave her an injection.
She died before the night was out, went stiff in my girl's arms and died.
- She was only just...
- Enough!
Why are you telling me this?
Listen, Dr Sema!
Menekse died in yourward.
It has nothing to do with me.
I know nothing about it.
Of course you do.
You're head of the ward there, aren't you?
My daughter knows you.
She gabbled your name for days, muttered, how can she be a doctor?
The drug I put in your coffee is what was in Menekse's injection.
You've seen what it does to a fully grown woman.
But in the report you blamed my girl.
You said the motherwas at fault.
- You wrote she neglected the baby.
- I didn't write that.
Yes, you did.
See?
Your signature's there at the bottom.
- I didn't write that.
- You did, Dr Sema.
Would my SeIin neglect her baby?
Poorthing, she couldn't take those words, 'mother's fault'.
She swallowed a bottle of pills.
Anyway, we got there just in time.
She fell into depression.
She eats nothing, drinks nothing.
No, she does drink.
Every day, in secret, whatever she can find.
She left her job, moved in with me.
She won't speak to her husband, she won't speak to anyone.
- l didn't write it!
I'm not Sema!
- You ruined my girl's life, Sema Hanim.
Sit down and write a new report.
I'm not Sema!
Then sign it and stamp it.
My daughterwilI get her life back, her mind.
I'm not Sema!
Look, Abla.
Look, my friend.
I get the idea about your story.
I'm sorry about everything.
But I'm not Sema.
Look, Sema is this woman here.
See?
That's her..
And me.
My name's Deniz.
I have nothing to do with what you're saying.
But also..
Sema wouldn't write a report like that, something untrue.
Sema is an honest woman.
She has a reputation.
Everyone likes and respects her.
She's into a ton of aid campaigns, she sees the poor in the east forfree.
- No way would she...
- You're wasting yourtime, Sema.
I know you wrote it.
Now it's best if you sit and write a new...
God, are you psycho?
I'm telling you I'm not Sema!
You're just an ignorant, miserable woman.
What do you understand about drugs or doctor's reports?
How do you know?
- l've seen.
I know.
- Seen what for God's sake?
You just see things, you trip out.
The djinns told you, did they?
"This report is false..
Sema is a murderer.."
You haven't even woken up to who I am yet.
I lied to you straight out about being Sema and you swallowed it.
You purposely wrote a false report to save the hospital.
You don't know shit!
You're wacko!
Paranoid!
I'm not Sema!
I'm not a doctor!
Sema doesn't lie!
If you knew the trouble you're in.
What you've done is intrusion.
You'lI rot in jail.
I hope to God you...
help!
..
Help!
Save me!
Are you OK?
Deniz Hanim!
- What's up?
What's with the noise?
- What do you mean?
- Out of the way!
- Mustafa, save me!
Mustafa!
Deniz Hanim?
Deniz Hanim, what's up?
Oh my God!
Deniz Hanim, who's this?
What's going on?
Some psycho.
She thinks I'm Sema.
Sema Hanim?
What do you want with Sema Hanim?
Who are you?
- If you aren't Sema, who are you?
- l told you, my name's Deniz.
- So Sema's that woman.
- Yes, her!
I'm not the woman you want.
I thought you sensed everything, you saw everything.
Those djinns who tell you everything forgot the most important detail.
- Who are you?
The caretaker?
.
- What's it to you?
- How come you're here waving a gun...
- You're sure this isn't Dr Sema?
What do you want with Dr Sema Hanim?
What business do you have...
Quiet!
Stop!
Get overthere.
Then we'lI have to sit and wait for Dr Sema to come back.
- Can I lower my hands?
- Sit down.
You don't know the trouble you've got yourself in.
Intrusion, hostage- taking.
You'Il be in jail for life now.
Deniz Hanim, what's this about?
How did we land up like this?
This woman's grandchild..
A baby..
Died in Sema's hospital.
The lady blames the hospital.
She says they gave an out- of- date injection.
Sema signed a report saying it was the mother's fault.
She says the report's a lie and she should change it.
What?
What do you mean a lie?
Sema Hanim saved my kid's life.
Say what you Iike about anyone, but not Sema Hanim.
I won't allow it.
Sema Hanim wouldn't put hersignature to a lie.
- She did this time.
- How do you know?
The lady's a fortune- teller.
She has her djinns.
They come and tell her the truth about everything.
- A fortune- teller?
.
- A socialite fortune- teller!
She bust her gut to find Sema.
She came to tell her fortune.
As far as I know, Sema's never had her fortune told.
When something came up in AE, I guess she forgot.
She didn't tell me.
I was an idiot for a second.
I said I was Sema.
Just forthe hell of it.
She drugged me.
My legs don't work.
Two hours.
Then they'lI come back.
So it's like you had a dream.
The djinns spoke to you.
And you came to get revenge on Sema Hanim, right?
Not revenge.
The dead don't come back.
all I want is for Sema to correct that false report she wrote.
Sema Hanim doesn't do lies.
How can you be taken in by djinns grab a gun and raid a flat?
You should fear God!
Father God has given up on me.
That was long ago.
I don't know what I did.
I've no idea what my sin was.
I've never lied, never stolen.
I did my cleaning, said my prayers.
Or used to.
I'd fast.
But He always found me.
Punishment after punishment, test after test.
He crippled my husband.
He took my grandchild to heaven.
He took my daughter's mind.
He must know something, I said.
It's my destiny, I said.
- But I've nothing left to fear now.
- Repent!
- Repent, woman!
- I have.
How many times..
I must have sinned by mistake, I said.
Forgive me, God.
I won't do it again.
The same thing over and again.
In the end, a voice came from the shadows in the dark.
Only the shadows understand my troubles, I said.
- I may as welI listen to them.
- God forgive you!
Abla..
Too bad, you've totally lost it.
But God has mercy on people who crack up, on crazies.
Too bad, you're off in cloud- cuckoo
- Iand.
Look, no one's been hurt yet.
Just drop this before it's too late.
- Mannak!
- Huh?
- Mannak Noni
- What are you talking about?
- Mannak Noni!
Mannak Noni!
- What are you talking about?
- l don't know.
There's a voice.
Awoman.
That's all she's saying.
Mannak Noni, Mannak Noni!
Woman, I'lI smash you to pieces!
What in hell are you talking about?
Don't move or I'lI shoot!
Take one step and I'lI shoot.
I don't know what it means.
I don't know who she is.
Mannak Noni.
That's what I heard.
Who in hell are you?
Don't you dare answer.
Throw it over here right now.
I've..
I've..
Oh God, I've wet myself.
Please, help me.
I can't sit like this..
Please!
Pick the girl up.
Carry her to the bathroom.
Come over here.
Go inside.
Shut the door.
- Are you from our village?
- We're from istanbul.
- You know anyone from the village?
- How do I know?
- How do you know?
- What?
- Mannak..
Mannak Noni.
- l don't.
You're the one who knows.
Here.
You want anything else?
Mannak!
Mannak Noni!
Mannak!
Mannak Noni!
Abla?
Let me out of here.
I can't take it.
Open up, open the door!
Come out.
Carry the girl back.
Mustafa, listen.
The burglar alarm by the door..
There's an emergency number. 2233.
It connects to the police station.
- 2233.
Remember, 2233.
- OK, 2233, but the woman has a gun.
- C'mon, a guy like you.
Whack her..
- Abla, that woman's something else.
- She knows things.
She freaks me out..
- C'mon, out of there!
Can you grab me that bottle?
The vodka overthere?
Deniz Hanim, I don't have a problem with you.
If you hadn't said you were Dr Sema, none of this would've happened to you.
- So I'm sorry.
- And she says she's sorry!
- She's totally out of her mind.
- l had no choice left.
I went to the newspapers..
Nothing.
I called the TV channels.
I even called Seda Sayan.
They wouldn't let me speak to her.
The lawyer said the hospital was beyond him because their lawyers were so good.
really big hospital, he said.
I didn't want to go there.
My son in law took us there.
Best one, he said.
He had some special insurance... I've been after Dr Sema for a year.
They won't even let me in the hospital any more.
If it weren't forfortune- telling, I wouldn't be here now.
- Anyway, thanks to Guler Hanim...
- God damn Guler!
She put you onto us, didn't she?
I just don't get it.
An adult woman..
She has a career, a relationship.
She's happy, healthy, has money..
Why fortune- telling?
She sends the hag along to us.
So we get to hear her bullshit too.
Deniz Hanim..
It seems like the Abla's djinns speak the truth.
- What?
- l mean, it's not bullshit.
- She knows something.
- Don't you start, Mustafa.
Mannak Noni's talking to her..
See?
She just did.
What is Mannak Noni?
In our village, when I was small, there was a crazy bitch.
well, woman.
But she was like my mum's age.
She used to wander round the hills shouting "Mannak Noni, Mannak Noni!"
That's all she said.
Like some wind- up doll.
But I tell you, she was beautiful, Iike no otherwoman in the village.
She was like tail, umm, slim, great figure.
Crazy, but beautiful.
So?
She just looked at me and said, "Mannak Noni!".
Didn't you, AbIa?
How do you know Mannak Noni?
I'm going to lose it!
For God's sake, how do you know Mannak Noni, AbIa?
The crazy know the crazy..
How do you think?
She knows someone from your village.
Someone must have told her.
It's not that simple, Abla.
It's not that simple.
Our AbIa here..
She's different.
I mean, I'm...
What?
I mean, there's no way.
No way can she know Mannak Noni.
The djinns were here just now.
And they told the woman.
For sure.
My legs are tingling.
The effect's wearing off.
Wiggle them round a bit.
You'lI be on yourfeet soon, don't worry.
The dog's been quiet for ages.
I wonder if they're back downstairs?
He has a life too, Abla.
Poor thing must be asleep.
Besides, I'd have heard if they'd come back.
My eyes aren't up to much, but my hearing's like a fox.
Deniz?
Sweetheart, were you sleeping there?
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.
Have you been drinking?
Naughty girl.
I'm starving. I'm making myself a sandwich.
Do you want anything?
- Sema!
- Yes, honey?
Are you OK?
Fine.
I'm great.
Had a Iong nap...
This damn weather's done me in.
Didn't you have a rehearsal today?
No, Ismet called to cancel.
- Who's Ismet?
- The director.
I guess he's sick.
And with nothing to do all of a sudden, I..
I had such a weird dream, sweetheart.
But everything was so real, I can't tell you.
It was here, at home, unbelievably vivid.
You'd asked a fortune- teller over.
A fortune- teller?
Me!
Far out!
That's not all.
The fortune- teller thought I was you.
- No, I told her I was Dr Sema.
- Ah, but why?
I don't know.
For the hell of it.
But she didn't exactly come to tell yourfortune.
She was out for revenge.
Revenge forwhat?
Good grief, some dream.
The woman's grandchild had died on yourward.
And you'd tried to hush it up.
She was showing me yoursignature.
That's dire.
What's bubbling away in yoursubconscious, sweetheart?
The woman literally had us hostage.
Mustafa, the caretaker, was there too.
We were sitting here waiting for you.
God, it was so weird.
I called you a heap of times, but your phone's off.
Why's that?
Sema!
Deniz Hanim!
Deniz Hanim!
Are you awake?
You've been asleep for over an hour.
Water..
Can you get me some water?
.
I got shot once in the army.
In combat?
No, a stray bullet.
During training.
My God, the pain!
It's like nothing else.
There's no words for it, Deniz Hanim.
It's like the world's ending.
all you can think of is water.
A drop of water.
Want some, Abla?
Catch!
Abla!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Go back to your place.
Do it again and believe me, I'Il shoot.
I pressed 3322.
- But it's 2233.
- Quiet!
No moving until Dr Sema gets back.
What'Il happen when Sema does get back?
You think she'lI agree to write you a false report?
What is Sema to you?
Ask your djinns..
They'Il know.
They know everything anyway.
Are you relatives?
What is she to you?
Everything.
She's everything to me.
My flatmate.
My other half.
My friend.
My soul mate.
My wife.
My husband.
My girl, my boy, my sibling, my cat, my bird, my flower, my everything!
Understand?
You don't, do you?
How would you?
There's no such thing in yourworld.
One woman being everything to another.
You can't understand.
It's beyond you.
Like that starfish you'd never seen.
Sema is my starfish.
You understand?
Are you satisfied?
Look..
Sema is everything to me.
I'lI do all I can to protect her.
She'd do the same for me.
So fuck off before she gets back!
You don't have to swear, Deniz Hanim.
We're talking like human beings here.
Like human beings..
The lady has a gun in her hand and she's talking like a human being.
What do you know?
What do you know about human beings?
Yourworld is this big.
The house, cleaning, washing dishes, the husband, the children.
She said this, he said that.
A sin or not a sin?
What the imam's wife said.
Has Father God given up on you?
Has the rice stuck to the bottom of the pan?
Your djinns, for example.
What if they told you the weatherforecast?
Orwhen the next big earthquake will happen in istanbul?
Of if a recession is looming?
Shut up!
What if I don't shut up?
Are you going to shoot?
If you shot us now we'd die for nothing.
A totally pointless death.
Tomorrow we'd take up this much space in just a couple of newspapers.
Fortune- teller Horror!
Young Artist's Tragic End
No, Young Actress's..
Young Aspiring Actress's..
A photo of me next to the news report.
A picture of Mustafa taken from his id card.
No picture of you.
You want to see pictures?
Look, that's Menekse, my grandchild.
And that's my daughter.
That was taken before Menekse died.
She was happy then.
She went completely grey in 18 months.
She drinks every day. lf only I had a recent photo to show you.
Herface is bright red, all puffy.
You'd feel sick to look at it.
What's going on here?
A giant bee at the window all stripes of black and yellow
Round and round he goes in rings Busy bee wants to fly free
Careful, precious, the bee will sting He'Il shoot poison under yourskin
Yourface will go all red and ugly That's what happens if you're naughty
That's as far as it goes.
Unload on the police from now on.
- Abla, I've a million things to...
- Wait a moment, Mustafa.
Let's decide how to sort things out with the lady here.
Sema Hanim, give me my report and I'lI go.
I won't bother you again.
That's all I want.
If we're sorting things out, then let's get the police here.
- What police?
- The police.
The police we all know.
- We don't need the police, honey.
The...
- We aren't going to tell the police?
For goodness sake, just calm down, Deniz.
- We can resolve this sensibly.
- sensibly?
..
Sensibly?
Sema, the woman lied herway into our flat.
She drugged me.
- My legs were paralyzed.
- But you're walking now.
You're OK.
She held us at gunpoint.
Mustafa's a witness.
- lt's a toy..
A toy gun.
- But we didn't know...
You want the police to laugh at you for being hostage to a toy gun all day?
- My eyes being dodgy, we had no idea.
- Asuman Hanim, look.
You've committed a serious offence here.
- But I'm not going to press charges.
- What?
If you had a complaint, why didn't you come and see me?
We tried.
Me, and my daughter and her husband, separately.
You didn't answer our calls.
Your men threw us out of the hospital.
Then they wouldn't let us in again.
Look, you go home now.
Send your daughter to me tomorrow.
My daughter can't come, Sema Hanim.
She won't leave home.
She's scared of everyone.
She can't keep her food down.
- She won't speak even to me.
- Sema, we need to talk.
Asuman Hanim, have your daughter come and I'lI sort her out.
I know a psychologist if necessary.
I'Il arrange a free consultation.
She'lI be fine.
Trust me.
- Sema, we need to talk.
- What about?
- Let's talk somewhere else.
- Say whatever you have to say, honey.
We have nothing to hide from the lady here or Mustafa.
- Why are you trying to talk her round?
- l'm not talking anyone round.
Why deal with her?
Why not just call the police and let them deal with her?
I'm trying to resolve this without any grief.
There's grief already.
Big- time grief.
- l don't get it.
- What?
is there something you're scared of?
That report's genuine, isn't it?
What's written there is true, right?
Is that report false?
Did a baby really die in the hospital and you signed a false report?
You didn't sign it, did you?
Say you didn't, for God's sake!
Say you didn't sign.
Say she's lying.
Say I know you better.
please, Sema!
I don't believe it.
What?
You..
Doing this..
I don't believe it.
- This isn't about believing.
- So what's it about?
- Deniz, please.
Don't do this.
- Do what?
Try to understand..
Life..
How the world works.
I..
I don't understand life.
is that where this is leading?
A baby dies on yourward.
A report gets written blaming the mother.
And you sign it.
The mother's life is ruined.
And that's how the world works.
It's me who doesn't understand, huh?
We've been togetherfive years.
You hide this even from me.
From the person closest to you.
- It's me who doesn't understand, huh?
- Yes, honey.
That's how the world works.
You don't understand.
You can't.
Because you've neverthought about it.
Because yourworId is this big.
In that world there's me, love, flowers, butterflies.
Maybe your family, your dear parents.
Retired Ieftwing teachers, idealists.
Cats.
Other benign little creatures.
Sumerian!

Hammurabi.
Dreams of being an actress.
Two drama courses, three bit parts.
Tea, coffee, good wine..
That's yourworld.
- A little girl's world.
- little girl's world?
You've no idea about the upkeep of this flat, how we go on holiday how we fly to London or New York.
The money side is over your head.
Who pays for our dinners out, the gym, the pool?
How?
Have you ever earned your own living?
Ever taken responsibility for the lives of other people?
You know how many people I have working for me?
How many people are above me?
Who I have to give what reports to?
How many people want my job?
How many vultures are lined up?
Have you any idea?
Just waiting to pounce in a moment of weakness.
If that woman went to the prosecutor and filed charges if this baby affair hit the press orthe media you know what would happen?
You have no idea how someone's entire work experience, all their hard work, training, career can go up in smoke in a single day, an hour.
You have no training like that, no experience, no career.
You have nothing to lose.
Sometimes the right thing can be wrong.
Sometimes, to prevent a greater evil, a lesser evil is acceptable.
Yes, sometimes, a baby can die.
It might be fate, destiny, an accident.
Some people will be bitter, some fall apart, some recover.
That's how nature works.
You survive as long as you're fit.
You survive as long as you want.
You wouldn't understand that.
You're romantic.
You can afford to be.
You have money in your pocket, people to love and look after you.
Keep your head in the clouds.
Live like a 30- year- old child in a fantasy world.
Never grow up.
Don't grow up.
Masquerade as me.
Be Sema, mess everything up for me.
Throw everything in the trash!
- You aren't Sema.
Sema would never...
- Don't moralize at me!
This is real life.
Open your eyes and look!
Sema wouldn't sign that.
I know Sema very well.
Sema would never lie to anyone.
especially to me.
She's my partner..
The only thing that gives meaning to my life.
Sema's not afraid of anyone.
But that isn't Sema.
You aren't Sema.
You're out of your mind.
Real life..
It's not real.
It's a nightmare!
I'm going to make you an offer.
To make up for yourfamily's losses I'Il pay you 10,000 lira.
No, dollars.
And 5000 for you to forget everything you've seen today.
Just a second, Sema Hanim.
Excuse me.
AbIa, I raised my hand at you.
I hurt you. I'm sorry.
But you really went at me.
You had me in a corner.
I snapped and couldn't help it.
I'm sorry, OK?
That's the first thing.
And the second..
I need money badly.
I always do.
But...
What?
- But I also have a conscience, Abla.
- What does that mean?
Nothing..
Just an old- fashioned word.
What have you done?
- 22 33.
- How do you know that?
Mannak Noni said, AbIa.
- Who are you looking for?
.
- Dr Sema Hanim.
Kurucesme Avenue No 85, flat Three.
- What do you want with Sema Hanim?
- I have an appointment.
- Who is it?
- Me..
Asuman.
Asuman?
We made an appointment.
Why aren't you with the car?
- I sent Patzi and Tony.
Rest assured.
Come on, come on.
Now hell got loose!
I'll find the car.
Give me some time.
- 24 hours!
Let's clear that matter.
- Which one?
In your place.
It hurt.
- I'm sorry.
It hurt that you tried to run away.
Light grey CRV.
2008 from Ihtiman's parking lot.
Find me information about a car.
I know where the car is.
After the curve I close them in front and you block from behind.
Man, that can't be real!
If we don't get it, we are both finished.
Easy, I've figured it all.
You'll make good progress with us.
- That's cool.
What happens in this Dragoman?
The officer on duty presents a description of the thief.
The chief assigned the case to you and ordered the person to be put on the most wanted list.
They made a photo-robot.
You know the best about that beauty?
BULGARIAN NATIONAL TELEVISION
Doesn't want your money, I guess.
- No.
It brings money.
2 sq. centimetres and it contains 20 000 Euro.
CAMERA Production Company
Not liable to inflation and can't be photographed from a chopper.
PRESENT
I can easily hide coins but men are more difficult.
Who are we hiding?
- A little bird told me that after Dragoman the cops have Martin's description.
Any time he'll be declared for national search.
I could take him to the cottage.
IVAILO ZAHARIEV
We went into deep waters with Martin.
If something happens, I want you to act without emotions.
You said he was promising.
- I can correct the mistake.
IRENA MILYANKOVA
He is a problem.
When you are caught by the balls...
- I know.
You cut the balls.
ZAHARI BAHAROV
Popov?
- Yes?
Will you bring me joy?
- I doubt it.
VLADIMIR PENEV
Everyone's gone crazy because of the high jacking.
What idiots let a thief through the front door?
Dumb story.
- Not dumb!
Imbecile!
We became laughing stock!
MIHAIL BILALOV
The Chief Secretary wants the man found in 24 hours.
We aren't magicians.
- At least we have a description.
It's still being prepared.
- Are you making an oil painting?
!
The officer gave statement 3 hours ago!
ALEXANDER SANO
There are details.
One hour.
- No!
I want it in 10 minutes!
And declare national search!
I'll supervise it personally!
- As you say, chief.
DEYAN DONKOV
When we catch him, I'm curious to meet him.
KIRIL EFREMOV
VENTSISLAV YANKOV
That's how it starts.
First you sit on my chair, then you take my department.
Mine is more than enough.
- Slavov shouted at me.
What for?
- For the photo-robot of the thief from Dragoman.
He needs it urgently.
Some more details...
- Eyes, nose and mouth is enough.
MARIAN VALEV as The Hook
It has just arrived.
- What?
The mug of the thief in Dragoman.
We'll have to look for him in this cold.
Screenplay THEODORA VASSILEVA GEORGI IVANOV

Sergeant Stoev from Traffic Police.
Good morning.
Papers, please.
Good morning.
Is there a problem, chief?
Director DIMITER GOTCHEV
Check him.
No.
UNDERCOVER
Original Idea DIMITER MITOVSKI
You are late.
No, you are early.
How did you fix the photo-robot?
- You ask too many questions.
Are you a cop by chance?
- I don't know what I am any more.
I was nearly caught.
You know...
If you are jammed, I am too.
What were these insane moves?
Have you decided to call it quits?
I had no choice.
- To enter the police station!
Admit it that you volunteered.
- Would anyone else do it?
You seem to be bragging.
The guys on top got crazy.
They want an exemplary operation.
- Let the mates sweat too.
Never mind them.
I need something to catch on.
What?
Details about Jarro's next hit.
When, where, with who?
You should have infiltrated a gossip columnist.
You're a good boy.
You'll finish the job.
Yeah, I'll finish dead.
Just stay out of trouble.
And keep your eyes wide open.
What are you looking at?
- A 118 meter boat with chopper landing.
What is it?
I've got an invitation for "Chicago".
- Chicago?
The musical.
The first performance is tomorrow.
Do you want us to go?
I'll pass Bulgarian "Chicago".
Does it mean I can go alone?
- Sure, baby.
But you are very busy.
- I'm free.
No.
Did you forget?
You intended to rearrange my books.
I never even thought of it.
- Here, I'm dropping ideas.
I'll see you tonight.
Bye.
Tough conversation?
None of your business.
How many times have you run away and were beaten black and blue?
I don't want to talk to you now.
He must be paying well.
Are you calling me a prostitute?
- No.
I was just wondering.
It must be hard for the other girls.
University, job interviews, public transport.
And who are you?
Do you think you're different from the rest of Jarro's fucks?
You sell yourself for money too.
But there's a difference between us.
At least my hands are not bloody.
Why are you silent at once?
That's the time I take to kill.
Sit, the rest are coming any minute.
Congratulations.
It's not bugged.
You can only turn it off once.
- When?
When you kick the bucket.
- I don't intend to soon.
When this rings, leave everything.
I want you on line all the time.
Anything else.
- We'll change your SIM card every 2 weeks.
You'll throw the old one.
Hi, hot shots!
- Sit quickly, we have no time.
Boys a serious deal is in view.
Be very focused, no more failures.
The clients are Turks.
They claim to be exact and want to buy stuff.
The meeting is tomorrow.
You all take it easy tonight.
I'm nervous with this nation.
Which century do you live in?
We'll try them once, if it goes smoothly, we'll cooperate regularly.
We don't care if they are Turks, Chinese or Japanese.
Is that clear?
Who'll take part?
- Everyone.
Where?
Martin, ask something else.
Hair, explain to Martin about the questions.
Brother, Jarro hates curious guys.
- Yeah, I blundered.
Be warned.
- I get it, Hair.
We are told everything at the last minute.
You know... prevention.
I'm going to take a leak.
The hour remains unchanged.
If you have to, call them.
That's the number they gave.
Are they still searching for Martin?
- No.
I don't know what he did in Dragoman...
But see how they drew his portrait.
Strange.
Give him a few bucks and don't bother me with bullshit.
Sorry, I lost track of time.
I warned you about this dinner 3 days ago!
What were we talking about?
Yes, about cameras.
A camera is not luxury today, it's necessity.
Especially in our job.
- Aren't you clever with cameras!
I am, it was my major in university.
- Come on!
Boy, I'm university graduate.
We had to be on time.
- Sorry, I...
Now, just be beautiful, that's all.
Yes, I'm a graduate.
Well, almost.
I left in my 2nd year.
Do you know where I'll put a camera?
- Where?
On my dick.
And I'll make a porno movie with this playful waitress.
Excuse me, I'm going to take a leak.
What do you mean in the car?
Let him take you to a hotel.
Will you make me that wine cocktail?
- Go to the barman, sweetie.
Only you can do it right.
I don't know why I let you do this.
Come, we'll talk at the bar.
Great!
- My foot stuck...
You had to choose one bouquet!
No time to get back home.
- A have a pair with Adriana.
Did you hear that?
Go!
I'll be right back.
- Okay, I'll take a cigar.
I broke my heel!
Come on.
2 minutes, I promise.
- I hope so.
See how quick I was?
- Good girl.
You missed Sunny, lingering in the bathroom.
So what?
- I thought you were interested.
You thought wrong.
What took you so long, man?
Cheers!
I'm beaten, man.
What's got into him?
Is it agreed with the mayor?
- Naturally.
You have interfered a bit with the excavation, but no problem.
This week we'll endorse your plans and next one you start construction.
I love this style of work.
Good choice.
- "Havana".
3 days with Javier Bardem in Rome.
Magic!
He's terrific!
- God, what a man!
My part was small but shootings were unique.
I had my own trailer.
Did you talk to him.
- Darling...
When shooting was over Javier took us to places all night!
Wasn't he married?
- Such a man belongs to everyone!
So we are walking in Rome.
We reached Trevi Fountain...
"La Dolce Vita".
- Javier asked me to jump with him.
We didn't, but it was incredible!
I have info.
Meeting?
Tomorrow, 10, same place.
What do you do, Sunny?
From time to time I organize events.
Nothing special.
And I adore dancing.
- Professionally?
Something like that.
I did the choreography for a play.
As a kid I loved going behind the stage to watch the actors.
It was there I found her after the finale of "Giselle".
Have you thought of opening a dancing school.
No, but now you mention it...
- Dear...
In this city there is no one proper place for dancing.
I know, I've been at most.
Hello!
I'm selling you the idea.
You buy a big place and Sunny turns it into a dance hall.
I'll bring a crowd at the opening.
Bring Javier.
- Jarro, what do you think?
As long as it is for Javier...
- I can be of assistance.
Besides, I have something in mind.
- We'll see.
I enjoyed the evening.
Thank you.
An ordinary evening with two hypocrites.
For me it was the evening in which you agreed to make a dream come true.
What dream?
- The dance hall.
You probably misunderstood.
What's going on?
- First it was beauty parlour, then PR Agency and whatnot.
How can I take this hobby seriously?
You know I want this very much.
- Yes, you want it...
You can't always get what you want.
That's the way of the world.
I promise not to bother you.
I'll take care of it all alone.
It will be my own business.
Or we could be kind of partners, if you want.
I'm sorry, I avoid partnership in an unfamiliar business.
Knock-knock!
What about sex?
Couldn't we find a cozier place?
- Luxury doesn't become you.
What have you got?
- Jarro's best friend.
Knows all his secrets.
His pocket book.
Names, dates, all.
He is preparing a deal.
- I'm impressed.
What deal?
He'll sell amfets to some Turks.
Today at 6.
Is all for the Turkish deal okay?
- Absolutely.
Absolutely.
I remember the story with the car.
- It was a mistake.
